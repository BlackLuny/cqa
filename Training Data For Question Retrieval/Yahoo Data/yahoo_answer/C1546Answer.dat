My dress designs - not eat, not sleep as much as I should, not drink enough water, and seldom answer my phone. There are times when human voices have the sound of fingernails scratching across a blackboard. A foghorn, or molasses dripping from trees. Since I don't want to blast anyone by telling them they may be boring me, I simply don't pick up. After all if there is an emergency, a message will be left, or whomever it was will call again. I don't like phones, nor visitors who arrive at my door uninvited and especially more often than perhaps one every two years. I.m strictly a workaholic/isolationist. And my life seems set in cement that way FOR GOOD!  Good question, it just provided a mirror for me I'd not looked into for quite a while, for a true reflection!|`|CIWd3vJIaa	I am never alone, I have all my friends here on Yahoo/Answer.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	clean my belly button|`|h1lDGNp4aa	Well, I live alone.

In my 40's I added quilting and genealogy.  In my 50's scrap booking.  Also stopped dating; liked reading better.  Now that I'm in my 60's & retired, I do it all - except for the dating part.

SWP4m1cLaa	shame on you ! yes she was a virgin, so what?|`|LNnRSLdtaa	they are delusional  they believe every word of the bible  so they will think they know she was a virgin    i think what actually happened is...    mary went down to the pub or something. ended up cheating on her husband and then didnt want him to be pissed off so she lied and said it was gods son    during jesus's childhood she constantly told him he was gods son and was here to do good etc  so he grew up believing it|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Seriously. That would take a miracle.|`|yx5eYC1Oaa	She just sat on the wrong toilet seat.|`|RxBe4y3Waa	they do. they also believe that, even though she was married, she stayed a virgin. not to mention the ascension, when she was lifted into heaven without having to die first. creepy!|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	yes god is capable of anything|`|ad3ORARNaa	If you are a Christian you do.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Only those that don't have a brain.|`|8phe4X1Faa	Unfortunately, yes.

Most of you people are so ignore it is sad.|`|cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	Some people believe this is true. Others believe virgin was mistranslated. And some might not believe she even existed. So it depends on who you are talking about.    However, if you do believe in a Divine being and you believe it created the world, then it seems equally reasonable to think it could help a virgin become pregnant. As others have said, even humans do this today with artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization. In some animals- though not humans- a process known as parthenogenesis sometimes occurs. In these instances, females, lacking mates for too long, reproduce on their own. I personally find parthenogenesis fascinating. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogen... However, in parthenogenesis, IF two like chromosomes determine the female gender (such as in people were XX is female and XY is male) then the offspring will all be female, and Jesus was male. Yet, again, I would say if God had the power to usher people into being, then God could also make a virgin become pregnant. It doesn't seem any more difficult than the former.    P.S. Peanut, even if you believe Mary wasn't a virgin, you might want to revise your theory a bit, at least. According to the Bible, I THINK (could be wrong, admittedly, but I think this is the way it goes) that Mary wasn't married when she became pregnant with Jesus. I believe Joseph married her after she had concieved, according to scripture. So, she couldn't cheat on a husband if she didn't have a husband.
de8ddd78ef1531f99dac734c3f440566aa	When "worldly" pursuits grow so important, so consuming to a person that they're more important than God and His will for their life, those things have become "idol(s)" in that persons life.  God has said He can and will take care of you - better than you can take care of yourself.  Faith in Him means believing, trusting that what He provides for you is the very best thing for you (and your family) whatever it is.  Work, in my opinion, becomes an idol when it consumes excess family life (include the Church family) and time alone with God.  After all what does it profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul?  I could go on and on.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	When you are more passionate about the worldly pursuits than you are about God.    It's not about quantity, it's about quality.  I spend a lot more time making than I do praying, but that doesn't mean I care more about the music than I do about God.|`|MED20HbPaa	This is my understanding and what I use to help me understand it better. It may or may not help you.     When you are married to your wife or husband, it would be treacherous to say "I promise to be faithful to you 99% of the time". Even though that 1 percent is marginal, your expectation in the relationship is 100%. Will you be faithful 100% in all areas? Not a chance! Will you give your spouse 100% of your attention? No, and that's probably not what they want.    But there are times when that commitment is being impeded by a "passion". For example, computer games like World of Warcraft. That's when your spouse or girlfriend will finally say "You need to choose between me or that game!" Somehow, somewhere, passion had turned your attention away from your significant other and onto an idol.    *Sigh*, I wish I weren't talking from experience.|`|c5a80b54427d403df08bd924a7e11fc6aa	When you put your possessions before God.  If your possessions mean more to you than your belief in God, then you are not in good shape.  A rich man asked God what he must do to be saved, and Jesus told him to sell all his possessions and give them to charity and follow him.  Jesus wasn't saying sell everything that you have, he was saying that you should not be so attached to what you have that you lose focus on Jesus.  Jesus should be first in your life above everything else.    Passion is more when you are willing to part with your faith to obtain your passion.  If you are not willing to die, go broke, lose your family, whatever, before you are willing to give up your belief in Jesus, then your not focusing on the right goal.|`|NjPjpewlaa	The Bible says that some are given to be teachers, some pastors, some preachers, that everyone has a different calling.  God gave you the passion for life, and gives you the calling also.  I think the key is to focus on Him, and let Him guide you where He will, keeping Him at the centre.|`|VG7Q1BLPaa	Jesus is an Idol|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	things become idols when they take the place of god

This means he was directly CREATED by his Father, Jehovah God.     Jehovah God ALWAYS WAS so he is not created, but who was? Jesus, and then Jesus came to earth to die for you and me. Why? Because out of all his Father's creations, he was most fond of "the sons of men"; us humans.    Secondly 2 Timothy 3: 16 - 17 tells us unequivocally:    All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.  -------------------------    If ALL scripture is inspired by the perfect, pure, and just, Jehovah God, it does not lie and therefore when God's word, the Bible mentions miracles they are truthful and what God inspired and directed to be written in his word.    Yes it was 40 men who wrote all 66 books of the Bible, but they are "AUTHORIZED" to write these 66 books just as the way they are for our benefit today. So who is the Bible's rightful AUTHOR? Jehovah God, that is who.    Romans 15: 1 - 6:    We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves. Let each of us please [his] neighbor in what is good for [his] upbuilding. For even the Christ did not please himself; but just as it is written: The reproaches of those who were reproaching you have fallen upon me. FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE WRITTEN AFORETIME WERE WRITTEN FOR OUR INSTRUCTION, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope. Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant YOU to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had, that with one accord YOU MAY WITH ONE MOUTH GLORIFY THE GOD AND FATHER OF our Lord Jesus Christ.  -----------------------------    The God and Father of Jesus is Jehovah God. It doesn't get any simpler than this. What you speak in your post questioner is of innaccurate knowledge, but there is a way for you to get it. Do you know how? Pray about it. If your prayers are upright, Jehovah will hear them?|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Sorry to break it to you, but the bit about Jesus being the son of God is also a lie.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	In those times a mans word was accepted without question so miracles were a daily occurrence.|`|HlFzl1piaa	You are simply .....

What is your evidence for saying they lied?  What other way is there for Jesus to establish his credentials?|`|8gveZWbHaa	I guess they wanted to reinforce the reason to believe by making this person supernatural.  After all, there would need to be *some* indication that this person was the son of a deity, so attributing special powers to him might make that more convincing.      Otherwise, he'd just be the latest in a long line of wannabe prophets|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	WHO says the miracles are LIES???? Apart from you of course. And what is your opinion based on?  Cheers!|`|jq85LU0gaa	According to the Bible, The New Testament  if you look at each testament it states, The Gospel "According" to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The word "According" is not a reliable source.with in itself.    The Bible had been revised so many times making the scripts unreliability.corrupt and contradictory.Its very metaphysics is not even based on real gospels of Jesus(pbun) thats what has demished the credibility of the Bible.This is one reason why Christians and Jews are undecided on who killed Jesus.    To answer your Question "They" or "who" Obviously had something to hide and wanted to counsel the truth from the world thus; manipulating the situation to serve there own evil purpose.     In (Deuteronomy 31:25-29) Moses peace be upon him predicted the corruption and tampering of the Law   (Bible And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded the Levites (Jews),which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them. For I know that after my death ye will become utterly corrupt, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will   befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.     After his death approximately 826 later in  (Jeremiah 8:8) its also confirmed that the scribes hands are predicted to have cause Bible corruption.  "How can you say, We  are wise, for we have the law of the LORD,  when actually the lying Pen of the scribes has handled it falsely? (NIV Bible,).     Similarly in (RSV Bible, 8:8) it says How can you say, 'We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie|`|jKB2FYqlaa	You forgot to tell us what the lie is, get off the drugs you troll.|`|Lc8hkjHPaa	Armour of God: where is the fact?|`|7kvTHzj0aa	well, the bible is mostly truths in the perspective of certain people. also, interpretations are different. scientific data provides possible alternatives to some things mentioned in the bible. For example, parting the red sea, theres actually a swamp near the red sea that moses could have easily crossed while the chariots of the egyptians were simply stuck in the mud. and the great plague of locusts is because there always was a seasonal plague, but that year, the people happened to hunt more animals that eat locusts, with a drop in predators, locust population boomed.|`|NjPjpewlaa	Except that the miracles are not lies.  They really happened.    What, you have never seen a dead person come back to life?  Or someone healed?  Who told you this stuff is not true?|`|8uE7gfwHaa	How do you know there lies were you there!  have some faith.|`|t36Dce0Laa	You cant see god, you cant see air. Do you belive in air?

Now come all the thumbs down and abuse from the religious crowd!!|`|f5XnkJCiaa	"The Message that points to Christ on the Cross seems like sheer silliness to those hellbent on destruction, but for those on the way of salvation it makes perfect sense. This is the way God works, and most powerfully as it turns out."  (1Co 1:18) MSG    "Isn't it obvious that God deliberately chose men and women that the culture overlooks and exploits and abuses, chose these "nobodies" to expose the hollow pretensions of the "somebodies"? That makes it quite clear that none of you can get by with blowing your own horn before God." (1Co 1:27-29) MSG    God loves you.

8I9uduIiaa	LOL - yep, some Christians do indeed believe this. I've had so many emails from evangelicals arrogantly insisting 'you just don't understand Isaiah 53 properly'....    And they think that because it's one of MANY scriptures not read in Synagogue, that we're 'hiding' something!    I used to answer with very long, detailed responses on the actual Hebrew and what it means when properly translated and read in context. Now I just remind them that any Jew and any non Jew can READ Isaiah 53 any time they want, either in their own Tanakh or online.    For those who would like to know more, there's a good piece on this in the Q&A forum at http://www.outreachjudaism.org/|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	that is the rumor i have personally heard them spread...    they say that if a jew reads it, they will become a christian, so it is avoided by the teachers - nonsense if you ask me... but what do you expect|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	"they say that if a jew reads it, they will become a christian, so it is avoided by the teachers - nonsense if you ask me"      that is absurd. rabbis don't skip over it. jews don't skip over it. it is part of our holy bible, the torah. the OT has absolutely nothing to do with christianity, and will not make anyone christian. the Torah was around long before the christian bible (NT) has been around.  jewish people don't interpret isaiah the same as christians, we don't see anything that relates to jesus. but it's certainly part of our bible, and has been since before christianity was invented.|`|oVHFz52Laa	We believe that rabbis skip over Jesus' new covenant and you are left struggling with saving yourself by the law.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	A good guess would be that they believe others skip over verses because they do it too!     Example: "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice." Jesus Christ... King James Version.|`|y8yLVQJnaa	Although I'm Christian and believe Jesus is the Savior, I believe rabbis don't skip over that chapter.  The earlier chapters talk about how Israel is a suffering servant, and no where in Isaiah 53 or the earlier chapters does it say the Messiah is a suffering servant.  That's why Jews see it differently.  Most of the prophecies in the Christian New Testament/Jewish Tanakh were meant to be subtle, not explicit.  None of the prophecies for the first coming of Christ even mention that it has to do with the Messiah.  That's why Jews see it differently.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Isaiah 52:13 - 53::12 had long been considered to be about the Messiah by the rabbis. But after it was pointed out that it was about Jesus, they changed it to be about Israel. It is about Jesus.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	Given that vast number of little corner churches with their own separate theologies, it probably has been said at some point. Possibly even in some "mega church"  with a large congregation. I have never heard of it personally.    As to why I assume it's because when they read it, they cannot conceive that anyone would interpret it differently and not conclude that Jesus fulfilled the prophecy.|`|MED20HbPaa	I don't think they skip over it. They believe it is just pointing to something other than what Jesus came to offer.    The old testament is full of promises of physical blessings. The New Testament says these physical blessings were a foreshadow to the spiritual blessings people were to have in Christ. For example, the "promise land" the Israelites were headed towards in the OT is heaven in the NT. If you don't buy this, then you're still waiting for the physical promises of the old testament, like an earthly ruler who will come and establish and earthly kingdom.

IFf5r9zAaa	Not soon enough!     I was watching Lost last week and one guy got killed by being pushed backwards onto an open diswasher door that had four large knives sticking out of it, which he was impaled on. Then another guy was shot by a blazing arrow, was engulfed in flames and burned to death writhing in agony. But then when Sawyer went to say "Son of a *****" they cut him off before he got the word ***** out. It's absurd.     Violence is acceptable, swearing isn't. What kind of messed up way of thinking is that?     Freedom of speech means hearing stuff you don't always like - but the pros of that far outweigh the cons.     I like in the UK and TV seems to be a bit less censored over here than it is in the States, something I'm grateful for.    edit: @ the answerer below - who's to say it's garbage? That may be your opinion, but to some people it's not garbage at all. I'm not saying there should be swearing on everything we see, I'm just saying that attitudes to swearing compared to attitudes to depictions of violence seem a little disproportionate.   Look at shows like The Wire and The Sopranos - neither of them would work without the use of swearing because it would be utterly unrealistic.   I find the murder of innocent bystanders to drive a plot along far more offensive than the use of the f word.   And what about literature? Should Phillip Larkin be held in less esteem because he swore in a poem? Or should we not read classics like The Colour Purple because there is swearing in it?     It's got nothing to do with "promoting" the use of cuss words, it's about recognising that they have a place in language and whilst some people may be bothered by them, many others are not.     Freedom of speech is a beautiful thing. But it's not true freedom of speech if you only apply it to the things you agree with.    @ HNIC - I don't actually watch that much TV. The three shows I mentioned are about the only things I watch. The argument applies to literature and music too.|`|OA1RxFA4aa	Turn off the f*ckin tv every now and again..thats the problem, u f*cks sit in front of the tv all day watchin this shyt    I agree with Evilwoman|`|AA12382198	My opinion.....those words may be out there but some of us still find them offensive especially when around children.    Violence is just as bad....and sex scenes just to get ratings is stupid.    Just because everyone does it doesn't mean it's right.    (bring on the thumbs down)|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Well, you've given many examples of why this world is so messed up as it is. Do we really need more of the previously unacceptable garbage becoming acceptable? I have to wonder when people are going to say they've had enough and stop turning the TV on and watching this trash and start boycotting the sponsors. None of the things you listed, including the use of foul language, should be tolerated. Being immune to these things is the problem, NOT learning to accept words as just words.

gW0nD5cEaa	Remember to be yourself, no matter how important you think you are. And remember, some of us are still above you, in 5 for example, so there is still a chain of command.    Maybe the higher you go you should have lunches with other people of your rank, like all the former Presidents and Bush and Obama did just before the Inauguration. It helps to talk to people with your own level of responsibility.     And never forget, always pick up your own socks and take out your own trash.

UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|332vXA6oaa	Jehovah's Witnesses, they are the only true religion, we are the only ones that are different from all the other religions put together.

In Christianity it is God who looks for mankind and sent His Son Jesus Christ to die for our sins so that we would not be punished by God but be His children instead and have eternal life.  As a Christian you have God the Holy Spirit in you as His home to protect you, guide you, teach you, comfort you and give to you His gifts and build within you His fruit so that you can live in the power, character and love of Jesus Christ.  All these blessings and giftings you will have by faith and grace (by unmerited and unearned favor) through the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross.  This is not like other religions where you have to work for your blessings.  God bless you.|`|AA11592327	Stay neutral. If you must believe in something, believe in yourself.

If not, then don't pick one.  Pick and choose different ideas from all sources, if you want.  Make your own philosophy or spiritual method if you prefer.

Worship with them.|`|SwtaUd56aa	If you accept a god exists, then Christianity, because unlike with other religions, the resurrection, if accepted as historically probable, demonstrates the God of Abraham to be the true God.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	If you are really that concerned about how to walk upright with God, then pray about it and if your heart is in the right place, he will hear your prayers and answers them. What you ask of him, "which religion should I choose to believe in", is something that is within his "will" not "Please let my favorite Nascar driver win, God". He does not answer or hear such prayers.  -----------------------------    Proverbs 15: 29:    Jehovah is far away from the wicked ones, but the prayer of the righteous ones he hears.  -----------------------------  BECAUSE OF HAVING KEPT INTEGRITY    Another reason why Gods servants can expect God to listen to their prayers is his love of righteousness: Jehovah is righteous; he does love righteous acts. Because of this we read: Jehovah is far away from the wicked ones, but the prayer of the righteous ones he hears. Those who follow an upright course can come to God on the basis of their having kept integrity with God. (Psalms 11:7; Proverbs 15:29)  -------------------------------    TEST YOUR RELIGION ON THESE POINTS    Most Christian religions teach that men should love one another. Does your religion teach that? Why, then, in recent wars have Catholics on one side been found killing Catholics on the otherthe same being also true of Protestants and Jews? Is this the showing of love one for another? Hardly. Jesus said: For all those who take the sword will perish by the sword. No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his soul [life] in behalf of his friends. The giving up of ones life in behalf of his neighbor and not the taking of it is the way of love and true religion. Does your religion practice this? (Mattew 26:52; John 15:13; Mattew 22:39)    Test your faith a little further. Does your religion teach that ministers should preach from house to house? Instructing his followers, Jesus said: When you are entering into the house, greet the household; and if the house is deserving, let the peace you wish it come upon it. And every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus. While I did not hold back .?.?. teaching you publicly and from house to house. Do your ministers preach and teach from house to house? Jesus did. His apostles did. And so do ministers of the right religion today. (Matthews 10:12-14; Acts 5:42; 20:20)    Is your religion an integral part of this world and its politics? Does it encourage you to be? Of his followers Jesus said: They are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world. James, a disciple of Jesus, wrote: Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God. The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: .?.?. to keep oneself without spot from the world. Is your religion without spot from the world? The right one is. (John 17:16; James 4:4; 1:27)    Examine further your belief in the light of Gods Word. Does your religion teach that the name of God is Jehovah? At Psalm 83:18 the name of God is given: That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth. I am Jehovah, that is my name. Does your religion teach that? The right religion does. (Isa. 42:8)    Does your religion teach that God is a trinity (three persons in one God), that Jesus is God the second person of the trinity? The Bible says: For there is one God [not three], and one mediator between God and men, a man Christ Jesus. One body there is, . . . one God and Father of all persons. Listen, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah. Not a trinity, then; he is one God. Of himself Jesus said: I am Gods Son, not God. The angel told Mary that Jesus would be called the Son of the Most High. Does this compare favorably with what your religion teaches? It should if yours is the right religion. (1 Timothy 2:5, 6; Ephesians 4:4-6; Deuteronomy 6:4; John 10:36; Luke 1:30-33, 35)    Does your religion teach that Jesus was equal to God? Trinitarians believe that he was. But Jesus said: The Father is greater than I am. Not equal but greater. Paul said of Jesus prehuman existence that he gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God. (John 14:28; Phil. 2:6)    Does your religion teach that heaven is the destiny of all righteous mankind? Note what the Bible says: The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it. For the upright are the ones that will reside in the earth. Jesus agreed: Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth. Not heaven but the earth will be the destiny of the majority of humankind. Does your religion teach that? The Bible does. (Psalms 37:29; Proverbs 2:21; Matthew. 5:5)    Hope this has been of help and hope to you. God Bless.
AA11156135	By definition, - God is good, not evil.    But the mystery of inequity recognizes that we don't know how evil originated. But it starts with rebellion.|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	Firstly evil is not a created `Thing` but a moral and free will choice to disobey the will of God Who is all goodness itself.  God cannot be untrue to His own nature so therefore God cannot ever be evil.  Satan although created good chose to use his will against God and reject the holy order that God created for him and all creation too.  Evil is not greater than good even if it sometimes appears so,the fact that Gods plan for a new creation(in and through Christ) is coming to completion means that evil will no longer be a factor for humanity when all is fufilled.  God bless.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	James 1: 12 - 15    Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving him. When under trial, let no one say: I am being tried by God. For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.   ------------------------    2 Peter 3: 8 - 10    "However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with GOD as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. GOD is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Yet GOD'S day will come as a thief..."  -------------------------    Psalms 37: 8 - 11:    Let anger alone and leave rage; Do not show yourself heated up only to do evil. ?For evildoers themselves will be cut off, But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace  --------------------------    I hope this has helped and remember that accurate knowledge leads to everlasting life.|`|CTlkMN3Faa	God is good , the devil is evil.|`|Zj8JkvX1aa	Yeah, God's evil.Satan is just his patsy.|`|oVHFz52Laa	No, God is not evil.

If you care to explain how our being outnumbered would affect our ability to treat the line of thinking that causes people to vote a certain way and yet would not affect our ability to effectively oppose the vote, I'm willing to listen.      If not, withdraw your remarks.
Xcri5qeTaa	Yes, New York is multiethnic with humanitarian values over racial differences, even though there are sometimes preferences for some who are deep in their own culture (speaking primarily Italian and coming from Roman Catholic family, for example) to be around similar people.    Racism is not a big issues in most metropolitan areas, but it varies depending on the city and region. There are still pockets of racism in the south-east and mid-west.    Immigration has caused some problems with what can be called racism in Germany, too. Since the Berlin Wall came down, the East Germans and West Germans have mixed, but the West Germans are used to working for themselves in a strong economy, while East Germans came from a poorer economy with lots of government support. So East Germans seem lazy to many West Germans.    Germans also has some annoyance from Turkish people -- I think it's the young adults who drive around with their stereos really loud and their windows rolled down, lol.    Speaking of NY and multiethnic equality, here's a video of ABC's "What Would You Do" on that subject. The show sets up actors in public situations to see how people will react. This show is in a restaurant where the employee (an actor) acts racist to Mexicans.    The full show is in tow or three parts -- the video links under the main video: http://abcnews.go.com/WhatWouldYouDo/sto...|`|AA10031893	It depends on the location. America is huge, and it has its good places and bad places. New York, being an upstate and upscale part of America, is culturally accepting. However, in places such as ghettos and lower-end locations, racism is alive and well. In the end, it all depends on how educated a person is and how ignorant he/she is. And in general, people of the same status live close together, so as multi-ethnic as it is, it doesn't mean the US shares the same acceptance everywhere.
H1NjIT10aa	The mother is clearly in the wrong.  She is teaching her daughter to abuse her little brother!      While you don't want to say that to your daughter.  You do need to tell her that it is unacceptable behavior for Your Daughter.  I would also consider curtailing the time your daughter spends in that house.  It is abundantly clear that it is not a good influence on your daughter.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Some people can't seperate their anger from the reality of society. You can't treat people like that. I wouldn't let your daughter hang out with her daughter again, you don't want these poisonous ideas rubbing off on your girl. You are sensible and clearly concerned about your daughters behaviour.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	wauw :/|`|AA10031893	There are truly some people in the world that just don't have a correct mind. Those people are incomprehensible and you just can't do anything about it. She does not have the right, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, you don't have the right to enforce the declaration, and I hardly think bringing in UN Peacekeepers is necessary. Nevertheless, you have to severely instruct your daughter that such behavior can have her end up in jail in the future.|`|3972dcebce6b2f1b72be1c48572bf2a5aa	would i advise you to do is teach your daughter some anatomy about male and female. and explain that what she did could be as hurtful as something done to female.     i have no idea what to tell you about her friend's mom. but i'd certainly discard them from my list.

You can help by telling other Brits that they did not do the world a favor by coming here and killing off all my ancestors and that America is what it is today because of the American people, not because the British so called "built" this country.
XsHkWdf7aa	Hmm unlimited amount of  money huh? Well for starters I would get out of debt, buy my wife a nice place to raise my kids, and make sure they had enough money to never have to worry about money again. Then I would purchase every Country in the world, and unite everyone under one banner, and commission someone to make the first Earth flag. I would like to die knowing that I had an impact on the development on a global community, I know I can not get ride of religion, but at least if we all were to unite under one flag, maybe things would at least start to get better for ever person on earth instead of just a few. Last thing I would try to fit in, would be to commission someone to write a song about me, to sing at my funeral, which would be a burial at sea.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Id burn all the money in the world if I could.

Tell them Scotland is free.  i would tell them to leave the children of this Earth alone in peace keep their religion and dogma to themselves. I would want to step up to the plate and take the obligation to make this a better place. i would tell them to survive that in my death i leave them the greatest gift in the world peace keep it going.|`|oVHFz52Laa	I would feed the por and clothe them.

I really admire what she does with her celebrity.  the folks I see on the streets, I would help them out more. you know, I would just seek out places and people that needed help and do what I could.    ethan hawke is not my God, and by God's standard yes we do have an obligation with what he has entrusted us with. we have to answer for what we do here to him. I don't think I want to have to face him and say that I just blew it all when there are people starving around me. If I'm dying anyway, I don't really need it. I'll make sure I'm taken care of and Im sure there will be plenty of money for me to do  a few things that would just please me, but most of all make sure my family can make it without me, and with the rest of it, help as many people as I can before I leave this earth. that is my duty.    ...and some people never got a choice.|`|7e8NN8saaa	I wouldn't do much different - maybe do some traveling I have been postponing.

Crickets, flies, mosquitos.. that sort of thing.    Once the insects are living 3x or 4x their normal lifespan, I would have my researchers release them upon the world. They would spread disease, consume crops, and overrun the world now that they would live longer and therefore have a higher population.

nwnILcEAaa	Had one of the homeless inform me that a stay in a shelter resulted in a big body lice infestation and he was homeless and miserable. I never thought about that problem, but helps explain why many homeless don't want to go to a shelter. This particular gentleman preferreed to sleep under a cardboard box in the entrance to a McDonald's in D.C. The district is full of homeless.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	I'm in a small town, no homeless here.  But the cities have a huge problem. Apparently there are a lot more people that are one pay check away from being homeless. And, it's not their fault.  The rising cost of housing and food has become unmanageable for many.  Very, very sad.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	I run into them all the time and every day. Our city has shelters but there are rules, no drinking, no drugs. There are many who want nothing to do with the shelters, they camp in the parks and on the beaches.  Alcohol and drug abuse can age a 35 to 50 year old to look much older.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	Yes I know where they are. I worked downtown okc and I encountered the homeless comming into the place where I worked daily. It is so sad. I gave food to several or a warm place to sit and read.My boss really didn't like it but he was not there till afternoon.Some were young kids,some were mentally ill.We have so much  gov. waste and I know about the drinking and drugs but they are human and deserve  food and warmth too.We don't have enough shelters here when it is really cold.Years ago the hospital where I worked gave away  a sack lunch every day to anyone who was hungary.They knew to line up but now they don't offer it.Charity out the window.|`|AA11767291	No. Ive seen one once in a while near the freeway,though.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Most cities have shelters for the Homeless    Most shelters have rules against 12-packs of beer (which is why no small percentage ARE homeless)    Therefore . . . many Homeless refuse to go to the shelters.  They would rather sleep under a bridge with a 12-pack then in a bed without it.    Those are the facts.       You can call your local information and find out about shelters in your area.    Dan in Miami   (where we have REDUCED the on-street Homeless population)|`|f459cc0f525ea8d849cf09f4734bd6a5aa	I am aware of every shelter in my town, womens' shelter, men's, families, etc.    If this happens to you, just do a little research so you can direct any person to where they need to go.    Generally, the homeless know the shelters, they have been there many times.  But like the ole saying, Knowledge is Power.  You can help anyone if you take the time to get the knowledge.    Most are State or County run agencies, or Church  agencies. Please just take the time to find out.|`|SfGyzMSFaa	Yes, I know of several shelters in my area-in the County where I reside and two other Counties. Twice I have paid taxi fare to get a person to one of these shelters, and once I paid taxi fare for a person to go our Health Care for the Homeless clinic. (Over a 25 year period).     A good place to find this information in many U.S. locations is the Information and Resource phone line operated by the United Way. Dial 2-1-1 and you can speak with a person who has access to a computer database of community resources.    However; I wouldn't assume a person is homeless just by their appearance. It's possible; but a more likely scenario is that the person you saw either had a place to stay or was 'fortifying' himself before he went to a warm shelter. If I was worried, I might phone the non-emergency phone number for my local law enforcement agency to report my concerns and request a wellness check.|`|AA12382198	We have about 5-7 shelters and when it's cold or raining a bus drives around in the city and will take them to the shelters if they want to go.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	No. But years ago we befriended a homeless man. I owned a business then and he would come in for some extra money. I put him to work. He lived the way he did because he wanted to. He wasn't on drugs or a drunk. He just didn't want the responsibilities of a family or a wife.     We have a growing problem of homelessness in the city here. More and more companies and businesses are closing. There are several shelters open and more expanding to meet the needs.|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	He must have had money because beer is kind of a luxury for the homeless it's usually a bottle of cheap wine!!!|`|8G42oyydaa	Many homeless people are also mentally ill, and not able to protect themselves or access housing on their own. Sadly there is often no room at shelters for all of them and many are turned away.     Many turn to alcohol because their best friend "Oblivia" is the only company they have, and she helps to numb the pain of being alone, homeless, often abused, misunderstood and forgotten.    I would call someone who works with the homeless and advise them that this man is in your area, IF you are sure he IS homeless. Some people who don't take care of themselves may appear to be homeless but arent.    If you see him again ask the people in the store if they know what his situation is.     Grooming and hygiene is one of the first things to go with elderly men living on their own, especially if there is some dementia.    You are a kind person to care.  There arent that many caring people in the world and we need all we can get.    Shelters are no place you really want to be, trust me. People going there can pretty much count on having everything they brought with them stolen while they are sleeping. They are noisy and populated with addicts, hookers, and often the lowest form of life on the planet, as well as the genuinely good people who have encountered hard times.
HLqzrBNmaa	There was actually a period of time where 8 fingered sea creatures were making their way into dry land however most of them went through evolution and as a result 3 of the fingers joined to create a five finger platform. Some went of further and had even less e.g. Horses. In my view it is just blind luck/bad-luck that we have 5 fingers.|`|HOXWWmsFaa	some ppl r born with a sixth finger, but for cosmetic reasons, or they may not have proper control over it, they usually just snip it off at birth|`|FswuiOIjaa	Your hand has 5 fingers because the recessive gene is  in your family for 5 fingers.

aOjMf5SPaa	That would be hell.|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	Far from it, in Heaven our very being will be an incredible source of praise and glory to God and the often quoted image of us constantly kneeling throughout eternity is not a correct view at all.  Jesus told us this fact about Heaven,`` No eye has seen no ear has heard,nor has it entered into the heart of man what God has prepared for those who love Him``  This fact alone should put an end to human speculation about a paradise we cannot begin to imagine,but people will still insist on trying to fathom it with finite minds.  One thing we can say though is that we were made to be dynamic in nature and we would quickly get bored with little to do,so it is only logical that in Heaven we will not be simply passive but will have endless variety as Jesus hinted at.  In other words Heaven will not be all kneeling and praising, as most tend to think, God has an infinite mind that will provide infinite joy and fulfilment.  God bless.|`|HaVPD1qfaa	i heard it goes something like that..but if you're really a Christian, that shouldn't bother you|`|SwtaUd56aa	The ultimate hope for the orthodox Christian is resurrection to a new or renewed earth. So, eternity will be in many ways similar to life as it is now, without all the evils.

qCtbizzPaa	Blame your ancestors. They had much bigger jaws so all their teeth fit, but once they discovered fire, they didn't need such massive jaws to chew their food. Also, they grew bigger brains, which started crowding your teeth.    Oh, and make sure you never take your penicillin in the same meal with dairy. I found that out the hard way.|`|GGUDvicaaa	Oh, poor cute kitty, I dont know! Bad bad wisdom teeth!|`|pElG2K61aa	At least wisdom teeth aren't like income tax. Once it's done, it's done.

4Ef8yCbfaa	Your statement is wrong.    In fact, many western women would be surprised to learn that the history of Arab feminism (a term often considered oxymoronic) is long, layered, and impressive. That this is not well understood in the West is not surprising. As Dawn Chatty and Annika Rabo write in the introduction to their edited collection, Organising Women: Formal and Informal Womens Groups in the Middle East, Middle Eastern womens groups are notnearly as well documented as in the rest of the world.There isa great deal of antagonism between the Middle East and the West where the latter sees men from the Middle East as suppressing and secluding their women, and where the Middle Easterner underlines the immorality of women in the West. This conflict is one reason why women in the Middle East do not get international attention when organised in groups.    Not only do the struggles of Arab feminists have a long history, but over the 1980s and 1990s, as Val Moghadam observes in the same book, womens NGOs [in the Middle East and North Africa] have grown exponentially and are taking on increasingly important responsibilities in the context of state withdrawal from the provision of social services and in the context of a global trend in the expansion of civil society.|`|B309jFKeaa	Why don't right wing nuts go to Saudi Arabia since they love theocracy?|`|C7vYkIfyaa	well, all women in Arab countries are not oppressed, the same as all women in western countries are not "free"    i think it is wrong to assume that just because someone dresses or acts differently from you that they are somehow not choosing to do so and that they are being forced to do it. and feminists do go over to arab countries all the time. but in a lot of arab countries especially in the Gulf, they are rich from oil and other stuff. so yes, these women don't drive, because they have drivers, they don't work because  their husbands are rich, i could go on but i think you get the point. this might not be the case for all women there, but i know a lot of women from the region and they all like it.|`|bibIAhN9aa	feminism is a prol thing, go to any council estate in the uk and you'll see that faminism doesn't exist there in most cases. It's just rich educated women getting worked up cus they don't like the idea of fulfillng their natural born duty as child care giver.|`|283tO9j9aa	My friend was born in the United Arab Emirates to English parents. His mother used to drive around and do all sorts of stuff she wasn't supposed to.    I suppose technically she wasn't helping that much, but the fact that she was doing things that women were not allowed to do is better in my eyes than just complaining about it.|`|SvAwrzZ4aa	its their religion its not done by force|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	I am stunned at your ignorance!!    I have usually agreed with your opinions and liked answering your questions, but you seem to be suggesting that women should know their place and shut up about trying to be equal!    Why doesn't anybody go to these countries and fight for equality for women?    You don't have to be female to be a feminist, David Cameron is one, as is Obama......
8bplNvAQaa	Not all people, but yes, they do.    Why?      Because they like to feel superior and show they've got one over you.  Or, because they want you to be a better person than them so they can look up to.    You decide.  It depends on the individual.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	because it is easy to say do what i say not what i do!!! i call it a cop out!!!!
GtazNrplaa	What a Hell of a time you must be having.|`|E9chZY74aa	It is not religion that is hurting her.  God tells us that sex outside the marriage bed (in other words without the commitment of vows).  To rebel against the commands of God and put your own desires up as more important than God, means that one is not doing what is required to reward heaven.|`|87VmFMEoaa	"Religion" doesn't do that to people. Specific doctrines and fundamentalism do that to people.    My religion doesn't have a hell doctrine at all.|`|oVHFz52Laa	The Bible teaches that sex is God's gift to married couples.

Forget what the bible says, religious people don't even use the book any more but rather rely upon what their preachers say.    This is one of the reason I am ruthless with clergy whenever I run across them.    This is not something that a simple logical conversation is going to fix--people suicide under such pressures all the time.    Don't be scared but thread with care--good luck.|`|ybFg4umCaa	Yeah, anythhing that could remotely be considered enjoyable is a sin to them|`|2AqU4SjYaa	No one is "forced" to be in this religion or that.       They are voluntary organizations we choose to belong to . . . .     If your girlfriend is having a conflict with her actions and her faith . . . how about you let her sort it out?        How about you tell her, you love her, and whatever she decides . . . you support her decision.    Now . . . if he was "married" she would not be in the jam . . .     You "could" get married . . . I'll let you sort that out.    Dan in Miami|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Religions teach hate and intolerance and control you through fear. Her pastor is playing the fear card.|`|otEpwY5eaa	LOL I bet you her pastor has been touching little boys wing wangs.    Catholicism: The reason why there are unwanted babies being born. The reason for so many children in orphanages.  You either have no sex until you're married.. or have sex before marriage with NO CONTRACEPTION since contraception isn't allowed and GO TO HELL.    Hmm.. so if a straight Catholic 'accidentally' had sex and got knocked up, 'killing a baby' (or an unborn, unfeeling foetus) is a sin, then she must give it up without telling a soul.    Lovely religion    Edit: Oh WAIT! I've got a solution! God apparently forgives everything that you ask forgiveness for.. so if your girlfriend prays to God after she's had sex, she'll be great!    Be funny if she prayed to God while HAVING sex though.. Baha!|`|zfFjKhJJaa	Some people take it too seriously.  Religion is fine in moderation, as well as everything else|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	Your definition of "fun in life" means sin to us.|`|s5xOMGcbaa	You refer to Christianity not religion. You have to remember there are many other religions that don't preach this kind of thing.|`|jKB2FYqlaa	Be afraid, be very afraid. Your on the road to Hell, you don't have any other means of escape other than through Jesus Christ, that's if He accepts you.

Let her talk it out with her.

Live life, enjoy it all. God made it all for you.

qEdhPD8Laa	I don't believe I was a wolf in a past life, though I do seem to have wolf-like qualities and a wolf spirit guide (among many others).    I think it's possible that other people could have a wolf spirit. Animals have souls, just as people do. Some cultures believe humans can reincarnate as animals, so why couldn't an animal reincarnate as a human? I had a pet wolf-dog who seemed as smart and wise as any human. I can easily imagine her incarnating as a human.    I know several people who consider themselves to be wolf-therian, though some have other sides as well. Therians and otherkin, in my experience don't feel the same energetically as normal humans. Often they radiate more energy. Sometimes people who are sensitive can sense non-human appendages in their ethric form. I know a dragon-kin who radiates energy that just feels like dragon. I've also sensed his wings, like seeing them, but not seeing them physically.    - P.|`|0IjomiJ2aa	Certainly not. A human being has a human spirit. People who have no relationship with God seek to identify with created things rather than the One who created all.|`|sAU0uH4Faa	I think you can have a wolfs spirit, a wolfs strengths and weaknesses, but you'll still act like a human, if you know what I mean.|`|tACJnpI1aa	I think it is possibel to have an animal spirit guide. And have the presence of the spirit of a wolf with you at all times. I'm not sure that you can have a spirit that eminates anything other than human essence. You may, however, take qualities that radiate from you animal spirit guide. I think if you are pagan then this is your belief.    Mainly, I consider a spirit to be a presence. And a soul is what inhabits us and it will always be human. That is what I think.    Edit: And if you don't worship the animal, I don't see why God would smite you.|`|Q02v1Cghaa	Of course, in the animist religion of Santeria, people have animal spirits. I for one exchanged my rat spirit for a horse spirit with someone I knew that worked at my school. It happened in dreamtime and I didn't realize it happened until long after i left school, but apparently I would have died without the horse spirit. I don't recommend exchanging spirits like that, for one the horse spirit isn't mine and is making me feel ugly.|`|MDXgGQUtaa	yeh prolly :)

Remember that if they are acting mean, it is NOT something you should take personally...either they are having a bad day, they are preoccupied with something else or they are upset with the company.  Just deal with it the best you can based on your training, and if the customer is not satisfied, refer them to your supervisor.      I would think that how to deal with these sorts of things is part of the job training...if you have a specific issue that you don't know how to handle, your supervisor is the best person to go to for advice on what your businesses policy is for satisfying the customer.    Bottom line, be polite, smile, thank the customer, empathize with his/her problems and refer to a higher authority if you need to.|`|3f938a1ffcd84afe57de9879e26aba19aa	there was a time when I worked as a sales assistant - the first thing they teach u is - "the customer is always right" - so just agree with whatever they say.....or if u cant......pass the buck on to management!|`|KuWLNfYbaa	It,s time you packed the job in and did something that doesn't involve you being in contact with the public in the service industry.Those customers represent all forms of life and i sympathise with you because in life there are some very difficult people to deal with.It,s not so bad dealing with them in your own business because you can have the last laugh when they hand over their money but if you are only earning a wage then it can get you down.Deal with them all the same way,with a smile

m89kGXBnaa	Vampires and sex have almost always been linked in mythology, even when vampires were revenants and monsters. Same for werewolves to an extent - they bescially become the archtype or representation of the less human impulses of humans - or our animals past or animal urges (sex, violence, gluttony). So that's not surprising.    Why they've suddenly become all pale, articulate, fashionable and pretty... Bram Stoker probably had a fair amount to do with at, as did the other gothic romances like Frankenstien (after all - where "goth" comes from) so it's not a new fashion. And people have obviously for the most part decided to jump on the bandwagon rather than try something new, so after Dracula we get Anne Rice, Twilight, etc. It's just becoming tediously unoriginal now.|`|597c2cb57b5dd60ca91e8fdd1a7325c6aa	For the same reason why people love to watch science fiction in general or horror movies in silent movie period until now. It is captivating to the imagination, it keeps you in suspense.|`|PgcyGDSQaa	I think it is just one of those things that is trying to portray evil in a way that makes it a choose ...like that everything/ everybody has the opportunity to be good but it makes things that much more evil when they aren't ...??|`|0IKdojzeaa	Why do you think? So many humans are obsessed with werewolves and vampires, etc. Everyone "wants to be one". It can be seriously annoying to deal with. Half bombard you asking how to become a werewolf or a wolf (which you CANNOT just become), and the other half want to get rid of you because you're different. So many people think it's "cool" to be a werewolf or a vampire. And they think they know about things like me because they watch movies and play games. So many people think that things like Underworld are historic documents...they're movies! Going to see a movie or reading something like Twilight does NOT make you an expert on something. Seriously, humans...please shut up your little role players and "wannabees". They're a serious pain in the ***.|`|4S5NnT7aaa	It may be because they're a lot better turned out and a lot less dangerous than most of the 'two legged wildlife' stalking the streets of our cities at night.  Compared to a dozen drunken, knife-wielding  chavs on a street corner at 2am, a werewolf is a minor inconvenience.|`|zwaXYoRbaa	There's money to be made off the idea of vampires and werewolves. It's proving to be a cash cow. Jump on the bandwagon now,..and who knows,..in 5 years, you could be a millionaire.|`|FswuiOIjaa	For the same reasons for billions of people sucked into religion, Billions of people fear death and like anything that says they can be eternal.|`|QGSaSo6Jaa	your looking way to deep into this.    werewolves and vampires are in alot of things because you can get a lot of action out of them. what kind of show would you get where there was a unicorn...

Can't you switch out of one of your harder classes or something? What kind of classes are you taking, cuz I never had that much homework everyday, even when I was taking 3 AP courses (I'm on block scheduling though). How many classes do you have? When you have so much work that it's impeding your ability to get sleep even without a job or eat lunch at school, there's definitely something wrong. If you're literally destroying yourself, and that's still not enough, you really should talk to all of your teachers or a guidance counselor about this. Is this really all being caused by school work? Your mother would not say something like that unless it was really serious. Do her and your grandmother see how hard you're working?|`|Mpl6auhBaa	Oh, hon, I know exactly how you feel; I got 2-3 hours of sleep a night for two years in high school and it was AWFUL. I think one of the only things that got me through was my mom, who was actually the one who pointed out to ME that something was very wrong if I got that much work.     For today, do what work you can (while eating something), take a nap, finish up whatever you didn't before, relax while watching some TV or something you enjoy, and go to sleep early.     And as a side note, is most of your work in one class? This has happened to me before, and I would advise you to transfer out and into an easier class. Trust me, it's not worth it staying in.    If you can't transfer out, then you need to set aside at least one day a month (on a weekend) where you put aside your work and just goof off, laze around, hang out with friends, see a movie, etc. You shouldn't work 24/7, and this did wonders for me when I tried it.     Good luck, and I hope you feel better!|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	"I don't eat at school"  Well there's your problem right there.|`|IYnxKUH7aa	LMAO.....become a hippy (y)|`|InlCtFHuaa	yeah...but she used to be right
JI7NQ9TNaa	I answered this in another forum, but it really belongs here.    It is his mother's ring. Return it.  Engagement rings are supposed to be returned if the wedding is called off.    And I congratulate you on having the Class to think of it.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	who broke up the engagement?  if he did, you keep the ring.  but if you feel that the mother should get the ring back, contact her.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	send the ring back|`|AA11717111	You should return it. He offered it under the understanding that there would be a marriage. Since that condition has been broken its only fair to give it back.|`|IFf5r9zAaa	On one hand, if he wanted the ring back that much, surely he'd have gotten in touch with you to get it.     But on the other, I think trying to get in touch with him to send it back is probably the right thing to do. An engagement ring is given as a promise of marriage, and since that marriage didn't happen, then ethically, that ring doesn't really belong to you any more.     It's sad, but you'll probably feel better for doing it.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	It depends who broke off the engagment, if it was him you can keep the ring. if it was you you are legally obliged to return it! If it was mutal idk..However, as its originally his mother's ring I would send it back, as it would be nice for him to use it in the future if he ever got married!|`|HaVPD1qfaa	if it was me, i wouldn't give it back..i mean, he gave it to me...but if you're really bothered, then do give it back|`|AA10804824	I think etiquette says whoever bought the ring keeps it, no matter who breaks off the engagement. Since it came from his mom, it's his.     you KNOW it's the right thing to do.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Return the ring, especially since it came from his mother, but also because that is the proper thing to do.  Judge Judy awards the engagement ring back to the man, if you follow that.    Since no one has asked for it back, it would be VERY classy of you to get it to him, or to his mother.|`|O4jGlC2caa	If he had bought it, I would say keep it.  However, clearly this has sentimental value to the mother.  Try to get hold of the guy and send the ring back.|`|qgZxmRR1aa	It was a gift from him to you I say keep it or sell it|`|pOYauDr6aa	sell it|`|DZzBfzVeaa	You should definetly do the right thing and give it back to him. Its one thing if he bought it an another if it was passed down to you. Im sure its something that they would like to have back in the family. You should try to get ahold of him, im sure he will appriciate it back.|`|AA11307468	General etiquette usually says that it depends on who ended the engagement.  If you called it off, you return the ring.  But if he called it off, you can choose to keep the ring.  However, being that it's a family ring, I'd do what I could to find a way to return it regardless of who ended the engagement.  Just my opinion.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	If it was a ring he bought for you, without a doubt I would say keep it! But being that this was a ring handed down to him, I would return it, or at least try.|`|mFf8CqAraa	Since the ring is in his family, the morally appropriate thing to do would be to set aside any ill feelings towards him and contact him regarding the return of the ring. If you've told him what the reason for contacting him is about and he refuses on being mature, see if you can get ahold of his mother. If you've tried in good faith to return the ring and the parties are being difficult, then keep it, but at least you'd tried.

Classifications & Verses on the Steps of the Way to Bodhi; Three Principal Aspects of the Path; The Fifty Verses of Guru Devotion; and other Sastra and thesis from the great master of Tantra practitioners.    *** Five time periods in which Buddha taught Buddha Dharma (49 years). (l) The Avatamsaka period lasted for twenty-one days, (ll) the Agama period for twelve years, (lll) the Vaipulya period for eight years, (lV) the Prajna period for twenty-years, and (V) the Nirvana period for eight years.    By the way you do know that Hinayana schools started from Sthavirah (the Elders) and Mahasanghikah (populace), which later divided into four major schools and then twenty sub schools in total? Then eventually only a minor school of the Elders left behind and turn into the Theravada School, which is still intact today; so where did all the rest of the schools disappeared to?     Some schools did disappeared because the teachings were either absolved back into other schools or became unpopular and died out, but majority of the schools had absolved the teachings which was taught after Agamas period, and evolved into major Mahayana Schools.     That is why in Chinese MahayanaTripatika, Abhidharma and other Hinayana teachings are parts of the Chinese Tripatika, as well as Koreans and Japaneses. Same thing with Vajrayana Schools, what Theraveda School has in term of Sutras, you can find them in either of the TENGYUR; KANGYUR and SUNGBUM.|`|e872a521e1cbd92693318b5ddcb3620aaa	These are names.  Words.  Think of the teachings of the Buddha divided into three main groups.  They are categorized according to the ability of the individual practicing them and his or her goal.  For starters, a person might want happiness in this life and a favorable circumstance upon their death.  This is all they want and their practices such as refuge in the three jewels are in accord with that.  Refuge is the door to buddhism.  The next level of practitioner may look at all of existence and being frustrated with it resolve to liberate him or herself from it altogether, this person is a hinayanist.  They seek the goal of nirvana for themselves.  They haven't "abandoned" the teachings shared in common with the being of small capacity as this "next level" of understanding depends on the foundation of the small scope teachings.  When someone sees that all living beings are suffering and recognizes that they are powerless to help all of these sentient beings but knows that a fully-enlightened buddha can - they resolve to become buddhas themselves.  They have become bodhisattvas because they possess this mind that aspires to enlightenment.  This wish is the door to the Mahayana.  Again, the great scope teachings, the Mahayana, depend on the previous two levels, or scopes of teachings, one doesn't pick "mahayana" they cultivate it.  Some can cultivate it quickly and some it may take a very long time.  No matter, they have a lot of work to do in order to generate this mind that aspires to enlightenment, this bodhicitta.  So, all of the previous teachings are shared in common with this practitioner of the great scope...Further, the mahayana is divided into two - perfection vehicle and secret mantra vehicle - but the goal is the same.  The difference is in how fast you get to your destination.  You could conclude that there is no difference among any of these vehicles.  If you set out from New York to Pennsylvania on Interstate 95, you could get there in a few hours.  If you wanted to go to Georgia it would take longer than that but you would still take I-95.  And if you wanted to go to Miami, it might take two days but again, you would still be on 95.  Thinking along these lines, you can conclude that all beings who undertake refuge and so forth are all heading to buddhahood...because they are all sharing the same road.  The small scope goes to Philadelphia, the medium scope goes to Georgia and the great scope goes to Florida.  Those going to Florida took the very same road to Philly, passed through Georgia and arrived in Florida.  They couldn't skip any of these other earlier stops along the way.  As for the scriptures...there are hundreds of thousands.  There are certain tests you could subject these texts too to validate them...but basically if they accord with "the four seals" you can conclude that they are counted among the scriptural or realizational doctrinal "sets" and adopt or abandon whatever is useful to you on your path.  Of course, there is a labyrinth ocean of material and the safest way through to other side is in dependence upon a teacher, a guide, someone who has traversed this very same ocean you seek to sail.|`|czXaUPIlaa	The Mahayana tradition of Buddhism is vast, with many branches. In Asia, it's likely that most people practice within some form of the Pure Land School of Buddhism. In the West, the Zen school is probably the most prominent form of Mahayana Buddhism.    There are countless Mahayana sutras, some of them dating from Buddha's time and others that appeared later. Here's a link to the most complete online listing of Mahayana sutras (includes some Pali Canon sutras):  http://www.fodian.net/world/    Although there are many Mahayana texts, the most important one for most schools is the Heart Sutra - a short and clear text that undercuts the entire approach of the analytical form of Buddhism practiced in some forms of Theravadan Buddhism. Here's the text: http://kwanumzen.org/practice/chants/hea...    The Vajrayana tradition uses nearly all of the Mahayana sutras, along with others that appeared within that tradition. The foundational text of the Vajrayana tradition is usually considered to be the Lotus Sutra. Here's the text: http://www.buddhistdoor.com/oldweb/resou...    The Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions both include the Pali Canon within their teachings. Both traditions use the Sanskrit term for the canon: Tripitaka.
MVT34FZsaa	Their Pope is almost as creepy as the Governing Body members of the Watchtower Society, they claim to be the only true channel of communication between God and people|`|AA11440601	Not really.    But by some miracle God will not let the Pope make incorrect decisions concerning doctrine.    The Catholic Church teaches that the Pope is infallible at closely defined times.    The Pope is only infallible when he, in union with the body of bishops, solemnly teaches that a doctrine as true. This is called "ex cathedra", literally meaning in Latin  "from the chair".    This comes from the words of Jesus to Peter (the first Pope) and the Apostles (the first bishops),  "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matthew 18:18) and "He who hears you hears me" (Luke 10:16).    At all other times the Pope can be just as wrong or sinful as you and me and be in need of forgiveness.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 891: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...     With love in Christ.|`|iHDYncuXaa	All Christians hear the voice of God. There are NO exceptions to which he chose to speak to.      John 10:27  My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:|`|17q7bAGQaa	God doesn't "tell" the Pope what to say.  The Pope prays to God and the Holy Spirit to inspire him, and give him wisdom, so that he (the Pope) may speak and lead the church on matters of faith and morals, according to God's will.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	you're right as far as I know.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	If a pope is able to communicate with God on that level it is because of his holiness, not because of his office. What Catholic do believe is that the pope will be prevented from declaring anything to be Dogma which is false. Since popes almost never do that, it is utterly irrelevant to most popes.|`|WimxSTqvaa	No.If God does that, He is no God.Papacy as an instrument of state policy was installed by Constantine.A simple,  noble and  personal religion was institutionalized for political purposes.|`|NpdAmv2Uaa	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: - nnot everyone claiming to follow God is following God..many don't even know him and just give lip service.. From the boastful writings I have heard by some Catholic leaders' writings, God takes orders from the pope.. so I don't think God would even be heard if he did talk to him, which I doubt he ever has based on the fact that so many of the R.Cs teachings are in major violation of the teachings of the Messiah and the Laws of Yah..|`|WC55CP9qaa	The Papacy was created primarily to maintain orthodoxy of belief. It does not have a monopoly on "revealed truth" but accepts that in communion with all believers and members, the Pope may say things that the church as a whole will accept. The institutional church is rather like the civil service of salvation - dry and unexciting, but essential for order and the functioning of the church.  I believe God communicates (speaks) his will to all human beings in ways that are unique to that individual. This is true even for atheists, many of whom have a highly developed humanitarian conscience because of this "Godspeak" (I am not condescending here), but can't bring themselves around to accept "fairy tales" or the essentials neccessary for belief.|`|G9VBTg47aa	http://www.apollowebworks.com/atheism/im...  This guy?|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Just to add to imacatholic2's answer (which was pretty much as good as it gets):  The last time a Pope spoke 'from the chair' was in 1950 when Pope Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as being an article of faith.|`|DgmlkNsIaa	we all have an equal relationship with God it is how we apply this relationship that makes us different|`|RC1r1tsHaa	What's poppin, Popeizzle

Kaki nasai.  Please write it.   Tachi nasai --- Please stand up.|`|GznItj4saa	As I've understood "nasai" is something alike a lesser commanding form which acts as if a suggestion. So oyasumi-nasai is something like "please go to sleep" instead of "goodnight" and okaeri nasai is "please return". It may sound odd to us foreigners but structures with "nasai" are considered acceptable in informal japanese.|`|B7C5PPgdaa	you can enrich your Japanese Vocabulary and Kanji at http://japaneseclass.jp/ its fun! just like playing game  and its free!

Otherwise, if the phrase is used as a way to motivate someone to make the best of a bad situation, then it can be a quite positive thing to say.

What we may see is more people becoming independent of religion and others changing religion to suit their life-style as fashion and ideas change. Religions have to appeal to the people for survival or they will fall by the wayside just like any other business that fails to meet its clients needs.

Religion has no purpose in our society today. It is a ludicrous idea to think we should be following a 2,000 year old book. We are not the illiterate, superstitious society that religion/bible was meant to govern.

To ask God to take the terrible anger, disappointment, bitterness, and even hatred that can effect a person facing an enemy.  Especially if its a boss or someone in power who can really cause some painful things happen.  By crying out to God many times from an on going thing one day the burden of tough emotions lifted out of my heart.

Peace is already contained in the name that was given to the Son of God eight days after his birth.   This name means salvation from every evil, especially from hatred, war and destruction.

It is impossible for us to receive God's forgiveness if we do not forgive others, just as it is impossible for someone with a closed fist to receive a gift.

He said this in the parable of the Good Samaritan who though they were enemies, the Samaritan still took the poor jew who was beaten up by thieves, cured his bruises and took to the nearest hotel to e taken care of. There are so many others.   The best prayer for our enemy is to forgive them and help them when they are in need. Jesus did the best example when from the cross the first words that He spoke were " Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing."That is what we should do. We pray for the enemies also like we are praying for our own family, that they be blessed with health and that they would turn to God.      Jesus also taught us not to revenge on our enemies even though   we may be right. On the other hand it would be the best thing to go ourselves and ask for forgiveness to our enemy and say that we want to be close. Even the enemy himself would be surprised with tthis and will surely accept the offer. We will feel only peace in our hearts after that. In Our Father we pray to the Lord to " forgive our sins as we forgive those who trespass us." That is the best prayer.|`|32xRsYa9aa	Fervently. In the hope that they will no longer be our enemies.

vDcDnO7Yaa	Obviously, the temptation is there... if it's a reoccurring dream. That's definitely not of God. The devil is playing temptation games with you.     If you are young... like under the age of 18 or 21... (you don't really need a boyfriend. He can wait if he really loves you.) Having friends that are boys are okay, but I'd restrain from EVER being alone with him or any other guys. No matter how innocent it looks! Make sure there is a girl that is around (who is a christian) OR make sure that there is a family member around at all times while your with him. If you want to speak to him privately... use the phone.    If you are any older then 18.. and the dreams occur too much... get married to him! That will settle the temptation of the flesh. And most importantly, it will be beautiful in God's eyes.    1 Corinthians 7:9  "...for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."|`|1UokhVRXaa	He tells you all you need to know about that in His Word.|`|89MKzLl3aa	You have doubts that you will honor your decision, that is why you are dreaming about failing.

dxlNwGuWaa	Ummm kind of.  They essentially mean the same thing, but you probably wouldnt say the top sentence as it doesnt read right.    It would read better as;    'If you don't change your mind, things won't get better.'    The bottom sentence is more appropriate.    Hope this helps    :)|`|KHXO5LPpaa	Yes they have the same meaning go with the second one though it makes more sense|`|5IkvPgfuaa	Yes but the second sentence is constructed better.    The first sentence sounds wrong because it contains two negatives.    It will get better as long as you don't change your mind. This conveys the opposite meaning but the construction sounds better.    As long as is better used to convey the fact that continuing to do something will have the effect whilst until is better used to convey the fact that change is needed to get the effect.    The war will finish "as long as" the embargo stays in place.    The war won't finish "until" a embargo is put in place.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	They convey roughly the same meaning, the first one is a double negative  (will not, do not).|`|TPpTAKAdaa	They basically mean the same thing.  The first means it will not get better if you do not change your mind.  The second means it won't get better unless you change your mind.  So they mean the same general thing, but are just phrased differently.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	Yes.|`|57791c51559578c5ef416190ce256015aa	Yes the sentences have the same meaning because the action of 'changing your mind' wont take place either way unless a choice is made of 'UNTIL' or 'AS LONG AS'.    Interesting question!|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	Yep.|`|AA10982716	They are basically the same, but the second definitely sounds better. The first sounds strangely negative.|`|x0bJmyDPaa	The second one is better.  The first one sounds wrong, 'as long as' (although it'd be better to say 'so long as') is usually used in a positive way - so 'It WILL get better so long as you don't change your mind' would be good.

qMwjrQbOaa	I think because of ignorance.    School should not be just a tuition class.     We learn the LIFE through school.    The backbone guidance of life is your religion.    A good religion teaches you the morality / ethical values, where you begin to understand consequences and learn to discipline within you.     Law of a country only disciplines outside yourself and is not always ethical. Eg: licence to promote tobacco, degrade the class of drugs, licence to use weapons, licence to kill (James Bond) etc.    Your question is very important, because today we experience yob culture, vandalism and knife crimes among youth in UK. Sorry to see, they have no respect to anyone.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	They don't teach kids how to make explosives, either. That stuff is harmful to life.|`|37LKDbtsaa	What country? This is an international forum, not the US of A. In my country, most schools have religion as a subject.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Because a school is designed as an educational system, not a misinformation factory.|`|T0SNBKOKaa	In Utah, that question is nonsensical.

The public school system can not cater to one group of students without infringing on the rights of the larger student population. There are many religions other than Christianity. It would be difficult to teach all of these cultural differences without upsetting christian parents.|`|z60A96sIaa	Good question,  OUTOFBOX    They all taught the Bible way back when all schools were private, sponsored by the local people, and held in churches.    Now the State pays for your education from a pool of taxpayers representing all faiths.    What do you want  your children taught? Right now it is illegal to discriminate against minorities and your child might have a homosexual teacher or one that teaches Mohammedanism.    So, we still have a good system and if you want Jesus taught in school, you will have to return to our Forefather's system.    Know this for certain, OUTOFBOX, it won't take too many more terrorist attacks until we return to the Dark Ages where one religion was enforced through economic sanctions and death laws. IT'S COMING and will seem so right to persecute the minority.  God reminds us in the Bible code: http://abiblecode.com    Shalom, peace in Jesus, Ben Yeshua|`|xF8TvlhYaa	In India, the government is secular.So in government schools there is no religious information.But, there are equal number of privately managed schools. There is some sort of religious instructions given to them.Hinduism ,by its nature is all encompassing.  A student who appreciates Hindu ethos, understands other religions well.|`|1hKz7F6xaa	Because its a pointless subject!|`|T2zD3FS6aa	I assume you mean in the US and/or Europe? It's because religion is naturally a subject that people are very passionate about and in these areas beliefs are very divided. Therefore any approach they take to teaching it is going get objections from a significant percent of the students or their parents. Easier just to avoid the conflict altogether.|`|1V1PzEYZaa	I live in the UK and religion is part of the national curriculum (i.e. it must be taught).  It depends on the school/area as to which religions are taught to a greater extent.    Where do you come from?|`|c5a80b54427d403df08bd924a7e11fc6aa	They still teach evolution don't they, and I'm sure that they are mixing in some global warming earth worship.|`|s5xOMGcbaa	I think religion should be taught in history, as it's a valuable part in human history. I don't mean any one religion just all religion in general. We learn about Greek paganism in history class why not learn about all the other religions as well. Then again who would decide what religions were taught? Some Christian parents would be upset that kids were taught that Christianity wasn't the only true religion and that whites were not originally Christian. I find it eerie that most whites don't know anything about their original culture. Imagine children learning about Odin in history class it would be great.|`|32NaMyWAaa	I think its good that it doesnt have because in India there are people who come from different religion and while teaching about one religion you will have to some where compare or bad mouth other religion to tell how this religion works and that way we will be sowing the anger and hatred of other religion in to our kids at a very younger age due to which they will not respect other religion and people from other religion this will ultimately turn into chaos.

GznItj4saa	It depends on the context. Both are correct. The first you would say to someone who is currently patronizing you but may not do so in the future or which has just started and has not been in the past. The second is when you are thanking for a patronage you have received in the past, are currently receiving and will most likely have in the future as well.|`|80841aafba2cedde2f2f011d05e695d2aa	Maybe it will be better as:    Thanks for your continuous sponsorship|`|kfps5jnyaa	Thanks for countinuous patronage|`|FGJV10tFaa	Second one correct: Thanks for your continuous patronage.|`|cOuz2RZ5aa	No.2 = Thanks for your continuous patronage.

4kEuzSpkaa	I think there always has to be a place for the old celtic languages. Although only a relatively small proportion of Welsh people speak the language, it is still part of Wales's national heritage and as such some respect must be accorded to those who do speak it.     That being said, if I were Welsh I would find being called "pseudo-Welsh" pretty insulting. Just as I would if somebody called me "pseudo-Scottish" because I don't speak Gaelic. A person saying such a thing is simply displaying their ignorance and lack of knowledge of the history of the celtic nations.    So,  our remaining celtic languages such as Welsh and Gaelic must be preserved as part of our cultural identity, even if they don't really contribute to our national identity any more (in the case of Gaelic it hasn't for many hundreds of years, since Lowland Scots was adopted as the official language of the Scottish Crown). They should not be allowed to practically die out like other celtic languages such as Cornish and Manx.     That being said, it doesn't make anybody any less Welsh or Scottish if they don't speak them, and anyone who claims otherwise is displaying their ignorance and quite possibly more than a little bigotry.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	The Welsh language is British, its part of who we are. Until the English arrived most of is would have spoken British (Welsh) - hence place names like Darwen and Walton in England.  Its important to keep it alive.|`|GznItj4saa	Language in this context is an expression of cultural identity but it is not the only one and it definitely does not define whether a person is actually welsh or not. I don't think there is anything more to it than that since welsh is essentially an almost extinct language. However, no language has a "purpose" as such. In fact, anyone could speak one language and essentially nothing would change. Speech is just a form of communication and expression. Languages are different ways of doing that which regionally and culturally differ. The purpose of a language is the same as the purpose of speech.|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	I think the Welsh language should continue to be used every nation should strive to keep its language alive,just as I strive to keep English alive.

Yes, face challenges head on and adapt to modern times with technology etc, but don't forget where you came from nor what went before you.    So many of history's mistakes are repeated through forgetting our roots.    Old wives tales and stories with morals used to be handed down between generations to keep this information alive, somewhere we seemed to have gotten too full of our own self-importance and thought we knew better and these traits that have kept the world going for centuries are being lost.|`|dxlNwGuWaa	I lived in Wales for 3 years at uni, living in a very welsh speaking area and doing my degree at a welsh speaking college.  Its all about nationalism and national pride.  Which is fair enough.  I'm in England and I speak English.  And  found its also a handy way to slag off people who dont speak the language, without getting caught.  Its one of the oldest existing language which is disappearing fast, and apparently they are trying to keep the language alive.  My mum moved to wales 7 years ago and is currently learning the language, and she thinks its great.  It is also spoken in Patagonia, so i guess it'd be handy if you went on holiday there?  I reckon if the Welsh want to speak Welsh. leave them to it.  Its their country, their language.  But when it comes to insulting people who cant speak welsh, its a bit out of order.  Its a difficult language to learn, and isnt widespread taught as a main language even in Wales.  My little sister is taught Welsh as often as she is taught art.|`|fZw6ImUGaa	I lived in Wales for quite some time and to me there was always something very contrived about speaking Welsh-particularly as a lot of Welsh speakers had actually learned Welsh as their second language. I guess you could argue that the revival of the Welsh language has created its own literature which certainly is important- if insular. To me speaking Welsh was always a very ostentatious symbol of nationality. The question is what makes you welsh? There is a chap called Wolfgang Greller an Austrian expert on minority languages and ardent defender of the Welsh language. Check out his stuff.|`|kFlMHSKIaa	It was invented so the English wouldn't know what we Welsh people were saying!|`|8X0lmhIQaa	Sounds like you got talking to a welsh nationalist. I'd ignore that if I were you. If you were born in Wales then you are Welsh.  In the context of preserving heritage and culture then yes it has a purpose but more often than not it's used as self segregation which is not the best thing in the world.|`|FCBJMSuxaa	Now i don't want to pick a personal arguement on here but I'm guessing you were e-mailing Rolyn braidd yn flin perhaps?    Now i personally see that Welsh does make me alot more different than people who can't speak Welsh yes! More Welsh no?    Not being nasty but that attitude will push people away from the language as i have learned. It's easy for me to say everyone should speak Welsh because I live in a overwhelmingly Welsh speaking area of Carmarthenshire and Welsh is our first language but it's hard for people in the South East who lost their language a while back due to policies of the ENGLISH GOVERNMENT,. it's not their fault that the language was lost. Now it is being relearn and successful to say somebody isn't as Welsh as you because they can't is racist and illogical. Is it a welsh person born and bread's fault that they were born into a different linguistic background due to their past ? No    What i do agree with though if you are ardent Welsh you should see the value of Welsh and of what is has to offer - the culture, history, heritage and expression of the language. If you proclaim you are the proudest Welsh person but Welsh is useless and the worst language etc then you aren't a true proper Welshman.

x1rnK5VHaa	The most direct, but not necesarily the easiest would be for you to come out to him.  Once you have that out in the open, then he should be much more open to tell you his preference.  Just make sure that you don't pressure him and give him time if he needs it.    If you don't want to come out to him, then you could bring up safe subjects like gay marriage, and let him know that you support it.  You can then see how he reacts.    The best way to get someone to come out to you is to offer them a safe environment.  By talking about gay issues, and being generally supportive, should make him realize that you are a person that he can trust enough to come out to.     If he isn't gay, and suspects that you are, then he might decide to ask you, after having conversations on gay issues, then you can decide if you should tell him or not.|`|EaurpLufaa	The best way to find out someone's sexuality is to ask him or her directly.  Especially if you are in a friendship with this person, you don't want to put words in his mouth.

WC55CP9qaa	It helps in spiritual life not to be too dogmatic and black and white about such questions as the one you have posted here.  What if the person who committed suicide did it to avoid being tortured and therefore revealing information that would have resulted in thousands of his fellows being killed? Wouldn't he actually be a hero?  What about the soldier who jumps onto a grenade and is killed, but his buddies survive? A hero, in my book. And Christlike, because they laid down their lives so that others may live.  I am a Catholic who tries not to be narrow minded. I believe I have had many lives before this present one. Now, that's what they call a heresy.|`|h5q89E3Haa	No. Suicide is Murder of oneself without a chance to repent for doing so. The bible Teaches Thou Shalt Not Murder. So if you're dead how can you ask God to forgive you?    You cant, so you die in mortal sin without repentance or absolution and you go to hell.    Catholicism is not a Cult it is the one true Church of Christ, if you really knew the bible you wouldnt try to justify sins such as suicide.    ~~~~Maybe you can provide Scripture where it states the unforgiable sin is not accepting Jesus in your heart?? Because if it is not there you are adding to scripture and that is a major sin.~~~~    Deu 4:2 "You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

And I agree with it NOT because I am Catholic (though I am), but for legitimate reasons.    1. There is always someone who has it worse than you. Giving up when they haven't is just sad. Life should be sacred, and YOU have to work to make yours better. Only YOU can perservere. Commiting suicide proves that YOU could not overcome things thrown at you and that you are weak.    2. It is insulting to those who have had their lives FORCEFULLY taken. For example, if your friend was killed, he most likely did not want to die. It is unfair to those people if you give up what they would have done anything to keep. That includes your troops that fight for you regardless of what country you live in.     3. It insults those that care about you. They do not want you to die, otherwise they would not be the people that "care for you". It is selfish to give in and take the easy way out, and leave everyone else to suffer.    Oh, and life is a beautiful gift, whether it comes with more pain than happiness. Just the ability to feel and know, and have a soul is more than I could ask for, and I will us it to the best of my ability to help others. That is what people who are suicidal should do, is spend time trying to help others, and if they think they can't, then they are just lazy. And it is ESPECIALLY a gift for those who think nothing happens after you die, because this is there ONLY chance to "feel", in every sense of the word.    What you said in your additional info is EXACTLY why   Neo-Christians like you are the problem with religion today. This causes people to think they can do anything that they want and STILL go to Heaven, just because they believe. That is wrong. So it should be ok for a killer with no remorseful thoughts whatsoever to go to Heaven just because they believe in God? NO!|`|VFWRdAH3aa	we Catholics believe that if a person is not in their right mind when they commit suicide they do not really know what they are doing and therefore can go to Heaven. the decision is ultimately God's  though. We never know what He wants.|`|AA11796124	  Will they go to heaven?>>    That all depends.    2281 Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to preserve and perpetuate his life. It is gravely contrary to the just love of self. It likewise offends love of neighbor because it unjustly breaks the ties of solidarity with family, nation, and other human societies to which we continue to have obligations. Suicide is contrary to love for the living God.     2282 If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example, especially to the young, it also takes on the gravity of scandal. Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law.   Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide.      As you can see, even suicide is not unforgivable. That doesn't mean every suicide is forgiven. It simply means not every suicide is automatic go-to-hell material.      >    What difference does it make what you think? It's not like you are the arbiter of Truth? It's merely your opinion, and a poor opinion at that, that the Catholic Church is a cult.      >    Actually no, the Bible does not teach that. The only unforgivable sin is Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  And what of people that, through circumstances beyond their control, never come to know Jesus the way a Baptized Christian does? Do you really honestly think it's automatically go-to-hell for them?

Brake any of them and die before repenting and you are going down.  The Devil leads you to suicide if you listen to God that can't happen.|`|EFHStOOKaa	OK this is in response towards Catholicism.  The Catholic church accepts the fact that people have mental illnesses and suicide happens.  They do not condemn you or look down upon you.  I don't know where people get their information. Catholics are christians too, they are bapitized and born again, we just practice it a little differently but the same principles are there.  They accept Jesus Christ as there savior.  With both Christian and Catholic churches they tend to see that suicide is a mortal sin BUT you can still be saved.  Most don't believe you go to hell, they believe that that person would go to Purgatory to cleanse themselves of that sin and eventually will be able to be received into heaven.  I even think that if they were in a mentally disturbed state that they would go to heaven because there actions where not of there own.    Catholicism isn't a cult, we believe the only way to be saved to accept Jesus and we do follow, read and study the bible.  I think its offensive that people stereo type Catholics without knowing all the facts.  One of my best friends committed suicide a few months ago and she was Catholic.  We all still have hope for her.  She believed in him, was baptized, and born again. Ultimitately who can say who will for sure go to Heaven an d who will go to Hell.  They only ones that know that is God and the Devil.
QDM3Y28laa	I know for sure that UnderOath is Christian, and I know As I Lay Dying is all Christian and have Christian themes, Alove For Enemies is Christian, so yeah, I guess you can consider some of their music faith-building and inspirational.    You can find God anywhere, and my Mormon faith has helped me understand that. In different religions we can draw inspiration and truth, and different music, even if it is not hymns or David Archuleta :P    So you're fine, don't worry. Plus, I love UnderOath hah. Draw yourself a standard though, and you know what I mean by that (ex. avoid songs with cursing, sexual innuendo, violent themes, etc.)|`|eY005pu8aa	You MUST get out of life the teachings that may be hidden there. Listen, but do not propagate the fear.|`|WyICbuPqaa	All that persuades a person to believe in Christ is good.  I haven't heard the music in question, but I'm sure you can determine this for yourself.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	Of course.   You're an example. :]|`|TzY9vkinaa	My fiance does, we're going to the Temple to get married soon soon. It's not something they ask about for your temple recommend, and they're not going to kick you out if you do listen to it. I however don't like it and feel like it doesn't bring in the spirit, though I do like SOME of his metal music but there was some actual singing in those songs. Not all metal is bad.|`|c345a0234bc2cff30d382612a53c4eb9aa	Oh, I had that problem for years, and I am 42--(ok, I was more into the old school metal, therefore.) I am not going to go into the whole thing about music reflecting your love for Christ, ect, because it's obvious that it doesn't (but sometimes it SO GOOD!!)    I am under constant stress, and found that switching my music has helped me calm down. I am just a tad happier because I don't have that going on.     I do listen to Christian music, now, and I really love it (at earlier phases in my life , I wouldn't have been like "gag.")|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Mormons can listen to any music that they choose to.  They're encouraged to listen to music that is wholesome and uplifting.  Read "For the Strength of Youth".  It has a section on music.|`|TOBc6sJQaa	I'm Christian and i listen to metal and many other genres of music that would be seen as "unacceptable" to listen to in my faith|`|TQge2oBVaa	People who say you can't listen to metal and belong to a certain religion, most likely have never given that type of music more time than listening to what the media thinks of it. Most media still thinks metal is for satanists and suicidal people. I would COMPLETELY dissagree. I am a Catholic, but I listen to Slayer. Listening to the MUSIC doesn't mean you enjoy the lyrics, and besides, most metal/ rock is filled with love songs in todays world. If they decide to shun you because of something as small as that, then you should find another church to go to. I understand COMPLETELY where you are coming from. I have long hair, and listen to metal, so everyone automatically thinks that I am a depressed satan worshipper. I am more happy than most people, and like I said I am Catholic. I have stronger morals, and more intelligence than most of the people accusing me have. I am not having sex 'till I am married, I have never and will never do drugs, I don't drink, I try hard at everything I do. I am the exact opposite of what they think I am, just because of my image. My favorite color is white,, a holy color for crying out loud, and I like it BECAUSE it is a color associated with purity and good! So I just go along proving them wrong slowly by just being who I really am, and not letting them get to me.     That is the problem with the new Christian movements nowadays too (I call it Neo-Christianity). All of these people who screwed up most of thier lives are deciding to join the belief. The problem is that some of them warp it to fit them. Now the two biggest beliefs are VERY wrong if you ask me.    1. The first one is that you go to heaven no matter what you do as long as you believe in God. So murderers who believe are saved, along with rapists, and everyone else out thier that are as impure as it gets.    2. The second one is that if you don't switch to thier belief system, and if you don't try to convert others you go to Hell. That is wrong because of all the people who may not be of that religion, or don't want to lose loved ones trying to convert them. What about Bhuddists? They are the most polite, and wholehearted, nice people there are, but in this system, they would go to Hell. That's not right.    People try to use religion as a rule book instead of a guide. Some things should be rules, but not everything. It should not be wrong to listen to the music you want to listen to.    Sorry, I  have a problem with ranting, when it comes to music (and videogames).|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Who is telling you what kind of music you can listen to?  It's your decision.  I think we do have to be careful of what attitude music gives us, but it's still your call.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	You decide for yourself.  If you feel spiritually comfortable listening to that music, then I'm not going to judge.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	I do sometimes, to be honest.  I prefer music that has a strong beat (my favorites are Linkin' Park and Rise Against, though they're not really metal).  I don't usually like slower music, because it just makes me want to take a nap.  And after serving a mission and listening to nothing but church music the entire time, I honestly can't stand it now.  Maybe it'll be okay again in a few years, but I'm too sick of it at the moment.    Don't even get me started on MoTab.  It makes me cringe.      Still, there are things you should consider when you're selecting music.  What of the lyrics, for example?  Do the words of your songs go against the teachings of the church (as in, do they promote the sex, drugs, and rock n' roll sort of thing that would not be in keeping with Christ's teachings?).  If so, no, you shouldn't listen to those songs.  A beat is one thing, but porn in the form of song lyrics is another.    I wish I could tell you that it's best to listen to music which will invite the spirit as opposed to just not chasing it away, but that would make me something of a hypocrite.  I would advise you, though, to be mindful of your surroundings.  It's not a good idea to blare heavy metal on the way to church or the temple, because you won't be in the right frame of mind when you get there.      Just be careful, I guess.  Music can be a wonderful way to invite the spirit, but it can also be a tool for Satan.  It's okay to have fun and to have different taste in music, but always be careful with what you're inviting into your heart and mind.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	This was a group that was half christian and half not  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj_10nD_C...  see if you can figure out what they are saying they are out of NC  demon hunter is another christian band I like  as an ex-mormon I heard lal the backmasking crap in the 70's about the name of the band being satanic and the lyrics forwards and backwards being satanic and you can look up the backwards stuff on youtube, like stairway to heaven and my favorite "another one bites the dust" and see if it really says "choose to smoke maryjane."  the new backmasking is daft punk|`|AA10358331	My husband listens to metal music all the time and he kinda got me to love it too!

Seek some advice from a councilor to help you understand why you can't accept the lifestyle and I bet at the same time you'll find reasons to except it. The LGF offer a great service.

155e47baf8efe28f58e95f4efe9cf546aa	I am open minded and have an interest in Folk Tales and Cryptozoology and there is a lot of similar "entities" all over the world the most famous being the Jersey Devil sighted many times in New Jersey at the beginning of the last century described as winged with the head of a ram or horse with hooves also there is Owlman sighted in Cornwall in the late seventies. There are many others what i looked for is similarities like many have red eyes and bat like wings and appear for over a short period of time to so many people then disappear without a trace. Some say there omens of death or change if you look in ancient  myths you will come across beings like the Greek Harpy a woman with birds wings and claws in India there is Garuda the Japanese have the Tengus a mans body but has a beak and long wings also there is the Gorgons and the Native Americans have a creature similar to Mothman so it seems he has been around for a while.I don't know if its all just down to mans imagination or unknown wildlife or something supernatural but i believe people are seeing something in our skys maybe one day the veil will lift and a great discovery will come to light.|`|AA11673762	Nope.

I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:    rasoulallah.net--  islam-guide.com--  islamreligion.com/articles/204--  http://www.whyislam.org/Prophethood/Prop...|`|IBoHKitLaa	The "sure' are by far scarier...I am ssooooooooooo sure!

XEBpv9gwaa	If the population were half atheist and half religious adherents, you'd have something.  But since the majority of people have some kind of belief system it only makes sense that the prison population would follow the general population.    And claiming to have a religious heritage and practicing that religion are two different things.  And, even those who practice remain sinners.    Your information doesn't say anything about if the person's belief was in place before or after the incarceration, either.|`|KT7cllsLaa	Because, they dont really know, how to take responsibility AND be responsible for one self  They leave it up to god(s) and the result is obvious    Texas..

He was pretty shy actually, and I didn't take much notice of him after the first few times I saw him because although he was obviously a man, he wasn't dressed up in fancy clothes, just womens jeans or long skirts and a jumper. Some people made fun of him. I giggled a bit at first but once I was used to him it didn't bother me- I feel a bit bad for that but I was only about 13 at the time.

GOD BLESS|`|AA11454904	Whether you realize it or not, youve probably seen several without ever knowing that they were crossdressers. Many surveys and polls have been conducted about the subject and its been determined that approximately 10% of the male population crossdresses to some extent on a regular basis. For some it may only involve a few specific articles of womens garments, while for others its everything from head to toe. For some (actually for MOST) its usually in the privacy of their own homes or hotel rooms, but there are those who are skilled enough at makeup, fashion, hair, and deportment to be able to pass well in public. With this in mind, and with the knowledge of that 10% mentioned above, you have probably seen a lot more than youve been aware of. However, you should have no fear of crossdressers. Fully 90% of all those who crossdress are totally heterosexual with no intentions of ever being anything else. Their NEED to crossdress is fast becoming recognized as something that they were born with as opposed to something they made a conscious decision to start doing. In simple terms they didnt volunteer to be crossdressers, but were born with the need to do so. The next time you are out and about, in church, or at some sort of meeting, etc, keep that 10% in mind. In all probability one out of every ten men in the group IS a crossdresser.|`|y8dTsfdxaa	i live in manhattan NY   and baby NY is full of those fur reals you see some crazy **** here  honestly im so used to it that its just like seeing any other person  haha|`|2f1IEC1Qaa	2 of them in 1970 at the draft board when we were being processed in chicago they were trying to enlist|`|UvYzQv5Saa	Well. yes i have, and not just looking in the mirror.

Aside from that, while not many people have seen a crossdresser out in about in public in his favorite dress, I can say for certain that everybody at least knows one without being the wiser about it.  5% of all men crossdress to a greater or lesser degree.|`|QIXxIXfLaa	no, but you will see then tell me|`|0hCGpwgbaa	well in this town is this guy thats pretty well known for being crossdresser...i personally met him at a club, it felt like meeting a celebrity,haha!  we were all pretty excited because this person is seen out alot around town.|`|OwHQrtEkaa	I have, but not necessarily out in open public.

l3f8kf7xaa	The Body of Christ, his Church, is the Bride of Christ.    Church (with a capital "C") means body of believers.  church (with a lower case "c") means a building where people come to worship.     We are all part of the One Body of Christ, so it isn't polygamy.    And who are you to say what can and cannot be done by God?|`|3WItFAwlaa	The Church    http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/m...|`|89MKzLl3aa	The Bride of Christ refers to all believers. You can read about it in Revelation.|`|yHfsHp6naa	Something created by man, like the Bride Of Frankenstein.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	it tells us in the book of revelation that it is the New Jerusalem that comes down from heaven.|`|rTplTuEdaa	The  Bride of  Christ  is the church,The  Church Of the Almighty God,    which  is  spiritual,,the people who  believe in God are his  Bride.|`|AA11622701	The Bride of Christ is a reference to the Christian church, made up of all those who believe in Christ and follow him.  As with any analogue, you can carry it to an extreme and make it meaningless, such as your idea that since there are many people in the church it is ploygamy.    It comes from the many Old Testament references to Israel as been the wife of God, such as Isaiah 54:5.  Or the books of Hosea where God uses the prophets marriage to a prostitute as an illustration of his "marriage" to the nation Israel.    John the Baptist in John 3:29 picks up this idea, and refers to himself as the "best man" for Jesus, preparing thing for Jesus' eventual marriage to the church.  He sees the time of Jesus' ministry as an engagement before the coming wedding.    In Ephesians 5 Paul compares that love that a husband should for his wife to the love of Christ for the church, saying the Christ sacrificed himself to wash "her" and make her pure and spotless.  Again the idea that the Church is his wife/bride.    In Revelation 21, the church in the form of the New Jerusalem, is seen coming down from heaven adored as a Bride.  (In contrast to the earthly Whore of Babylon just a few chapters earlier).    So while you may not be particularly impressed with the idea of a "bride" as an image of the church, that is your problem.  When you read the Bible and the usage of the word, it is clear that the Bible is referring to the Church as the Bride.|`|iHDYncuXaa	The Church - the true Believers.|`|zQyslfHKaa	Frankenstein's ex.

It is poetically referring to Christ's church, or the followers of Christ.  It is meant to show that the two are bound together as if under the covenants of marriage.|`|60303894b298b261e863d683d3b7c896aa	In several instances women are used symbolically to represent congregations or organizations of people. They also are employed to symbolize cities. Christs glorified congregation is spoken of as his bride, also called the holy city, New Jerusalem.Joh 3:29; Re 21:2,?9; 19:7; compare Eph 5:23-27; Mt 9:15; Mr 2:20; Lu 5:34,?35.    Jehovah spoke to the congregation or nation of Israel as his woman, he being as a husbandly owner to her by reason of the Law covenant relationship between them. In restoration prophecies he speaks to Israel in this way, sometimes directing his words to Jerusalem, the governing city of the nation. The sons and daughters (Isa 43:5-7) of this woman were the members of the nation of Israel.Isa 51:17-23; 52:1,?2; 54:1, 5, 6, 11-13; 66:10-12; Jer 3:14; 31:31,?32.    Jesus Christ is espoused to a bride, the Christian congregation, which is his body. (Eph 1:22,?23) At Pentecost, 33?C.E., the first members of the bride received the holy spirit with its miraculous gift of tongues. This was similar to gifts of betrothal, constituting for the spiritual bride of Christ a token in advance of [their] inheritance, for the purpose of releasing by a ransom Gods own possession, to his glorious praise. (Eph 1:13,?14) The apostle Paul spoke of those whom he had introduced to the truth about Christ and who had become Christians as promised in marriage, and he exhorted them to maintain cleanness as a chaste virgin to the Christ. (2Co 11:2,?3) Those engaged to, or promised to, the Christ are, while on earth, considered to be engaged and are invited to the evening meal of the Lambs marriage.Re 19:9.    Jesus concludes his illustration by saying: For there are many invited, but few chosen. Yes, there were many invited from the nation of Israel to become members of Christs bride, but only a few natural Israelites were chosen. Most of the 144,000 guests who receive the heavenly reward prove to be non-Israelites. Matthew 22:1-14; Exodus 19:1-6; Revelation 14:1-3.
AA11849917	The Bible talks about something called a "reprobate" mind, one which has so totally rejected Christ that they can no longer be saved.    Also, the Bible talks about blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, which is unforgivable.    Then there are the parables indicating that a person whose heart is too hard will reject the gospel message.    Hardness of heart comes from outside, being trampled on once too many times; and from the inside, rejecting Truth once too often.    Quit falling away!  Repent and return to your "first love", as the book of Revelations points out.  "They that endure to the end shall be saved."    Besides, you don't know what the future holds.  You might die during a point in your life in which you have "fallen away", and then it would be too late.  Don't play spiritual "Russian Roulette" with your soul!  It's just not worth it!    The Bible does seem to hint that rejecting Christ's salvation too many times could lead to a seared conscience, a reprobate heart, so don't play games with God.  He's not playing games with YOU!    The Scripture says, "Seek the Lord while He may be found.  Call upon Him while He is near.  Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, and to our God, and He will abundantly pardon."  And again, "If MY people, who are called by MY name, will humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and forgive their sins, and heal their land."    A word to the wise - don't put off until tomorrow what may otherwise kill you today!|`|89MKzLl3aa	Ones heart can be hardened to the point of not being saved-like the Pharisees. But, God will forgive your sins regardless of how bad they are, but you have to ask for it while you still have the chance.|`|NLinPsyhaa	The only time one is too far from being saved is if they die without knowing Christ. God knows your heart and it is only faith that saves. This is not a works based salvation, so in that, no good work can get one to heaven and no bad deed can keep you out.|`|bnPPrJY1aa	When they're splattered on the deck!|`|1jGEeMDYaa	No, according to all Christian teachings I have ever heard, God will always be there for you and never turn you away, no matter how many mistakes you make and no matter how many times you ask for his help.  I think the only way a person couldn't be saved is if they didn't seek God, or if they felt they didn't need to. But if they changed their mind, they would still not be lost. God would not turn anyone away. There is always hope for those who believe and want him in their life.    I am a former Christian, and no longer believe in the need for gods or religion. So I don't believe that anyone needs to be saved, or will be lost if they don't seek God.  But you do what makes you happy and what you need to do.|`|l3EVUl91aa	life is for making mistakes and learning from them, this makes a stronger and more wiser being, if we dont learn we will make the same mistakes over and over again, in this life and the next. this is by no means an excuse to do bad things as when we pass you will see/know/feel all the pain/hurt/comfort/love etc etc you have caused. the creator/god/spirit knows a lost soul from an evil one.  maybe you should throw yourself into helping others, finding peace and happiness within yourself by means that you feel are right and not what you are told is right.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Yes, at death. If they aren't saved by then, they won't be afterwards!|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Good news and bad news friendo.     First the bad news. Yes the bible does in fact teach that there is a point of not being "savable" (my paraphrase) because of your haven "burned" (the bible uses the word "seared" which means "cauterized") your conscience.    Now the good news. Such feelings will disappear soon as you deprogram yourself from such religious nonsense.|`|bTA5ndeMaa	16 If any man may see his brother sinning a sin not toward death, he will ask, and he will give life to him, to those not sinning toward death.    +++ There is sin toward death. I do not say that he should make request about that.|`|z60A96sIaa	Good question, Tjmw:    Sin is not to be trifled with and you just might become so enamored with it that you pervert God's Word to the point where you think you are saved while committing known sin. For all practical purposes, probation has closed for that hardened heart. The majority of atheists on R&S have repeated fallacies until their psyche is solidified and it is difficult for God to reach them.  Like millions of Jews who rejected Christ, they perished in the siege of Jerusalem while acting holy.    That trait is known as "presumptuous sin."  And many religious leaders thought they were serving God as they warred against, persecuted, and tortured whom they deemed heretics.  We'll be returning to those days soon.    But, as long as you are humble, repentant and feel your worthlessness, there is hope for you. Jesus came to save the ungodly, so there is even hope for demoniacs.    Also, because atheism prevails at this time of history, God closed and sealed up part of the Bible until now.  Among other things, it proves Jesus is exactly who He claimed to be, The Messiah: http://revelado.org/revealed.htm    Shalom, peace in Jesus, Ben Yeshua|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	I believe that there is always a way back to Christ.  If you read the story of the prodigal son in the gospel of Luke - prodigal means lavish and extravagant not lost as many presume - read the story from the father's point of view.  The prodigal son got in a right mess - spent all his inheritance etc - but the father just waited patiently, his love was not affected in anyway and when the son returned the father threw a party he was so thrilled to have his son back.    I believe that is how God is with us  Are you a parent?  Wouldn't you always forgive your children no matter what mistakes they made?  God's love is greater than that    1 John1v9 says if we confess our sins God is faithful and just to forgive us AND cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  Also remember his mercies are new every morning.    Perhaps you have more of a problem forgiving yourself?|`|cByRtCC9aa	No. I'll take it a step further and say that there is no point in a souls existence that it can't be "saved".|`|PYD9JyIzaa	romans 1 :28  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  this means if u keep sinning over and over again the same old sins - god will leave u in your sin - so u need to overcome your sin because no sin will be allowed  to enter heaven - ask the lord to guide u with his holy spirit to help u be strong against these things for all this is the devil's way to attack us - put on the armor of god - it is in ephesians 6 to protect u everyday put it on - stay prayed up and take a stand against sin - peace be with u|`|AA10674998	here is the question: Why are you figuring that you can spiff yourself up on your own and then merit a standing before God? Who is feeding you that lie?    The difference between the faithful and the faker is NOT found in whether someone is capable of failure, but in how failure is handled when it happens.    If you stand before God holding your faith in Jesus in this bag and your deeds in another, how will you handle defeat? If you fall into sin, does it make you shrink back from God, or run to Him? How do you handle the failure?    When I shrink back from God after I fail then it reveals whether my faith is in my works or it is in Jesus. If bad behavior makes me feel as though I have less standing before God, then how can I say that my faith is in Christ? Am I not going through a crisis of faith?    The Christian walking in faith handles failure differently, and therefore fails less often. Falling into sin for for such a Christian is a catalyst for nearness to God. It causes us to run to Him as the Author and Finisher of our faith. We know that He will complete the work that He began in us, and we can run to Him in our defeat. The resultant nearness keeps us from falling further, and in the nearness we know that we have every possible sin latent within us so we are afraid to leave His presence because of the inevitable stumbling that will happen.    Is there anything that nearness to God cannot cure? Is there any reason to shrink away from Him when you fall, if your faith is in Christ alone?|`|R1zUIh7taa	Yes, when they decide that they don't want to be saved!|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	No, but you still have to try to be faithful.|`|d3Oh9hPNaa	No, sir.

You've mention that you have accepted Christ as your savior, but did you accept Him wholeheartedly? Did you really try your best to do good things instead of bad deeds? If you really have accepted Him, you must learn to take time with God. Pray. Nobody's perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. It's never too late to go back to God. He is just there, waiting for you to realize your mistakes and to turn to Him. Let God hear your problems. Learn from your mistakes.|`|TQge2oBVaa	As long as you don't keep making the same mistakes, and you are TRULY sorry for what mistakes you have already made, you should be fine.

Saved from hell is the goal. Belive in God and act in concequence showing your faith by obeying humbly.    The only point in which one cannot be saved, even if he/she has done many good things, is not to belive in God, is associating parthners to Him, is taking gods besides HIM, the merciful.

o2fkN88paa	Hey! Im glad to see you show an interest!  I find its a great lifestyle and brings me peace in life. :)    http://www.wiccanessentials.com/    I think this would be a great website for you.  As for the essentials you will need to start practising you will need to read books, study, and practice the arts.   Its ideal to have an alter, in a quiet place, preferably your bedroom as its your own private place.    You should get:  an alter cloth  Athame  Tiles or Ornaments such as a pentacle stand.  A book or diary/journal for you to write in, alternatively known as a Book of Shadows  Buy different coloured candles.  Research books.  A miniture cauldron (believe it or not these are used)  Crystal Ball  Crystals  A scrying bowl or mirror  Dowsing pendulum  Essential oils  Herbs  Insence  Runes  Tarots    etc. Good luck!|`|s5xOMGcbaa	Read about the subject. Try to apreciate nature more. Remember Wicca is an earth-based nature religion so a strong connection to the earth is a good thing to have. If your just interested in Wicca because of magic than your interested for the wrong reasons. You can practice Witchcraft without practicing Wicca and vice versa. If you do plan on doing magic then a good set of ritual tools is a good thing to have. You can buy them but making them is better because it puts more personal energy into the items. Should have a ritual table, pentacle, athame(ritual knife), prayers that will be said during ritual, incense, chalice/cauldron (a fancy cup will do just fine), salt/dirt, water. Remember to have all elements present during your ritual Earth, Fire, Water and Air. I have included some websites which might prove helpful on your path to becoming a Wiccan. Blessed Be.|`|yAvTxh47aa	Oh, you should find a good store, owned by a Wiccan in dire need of economic help.    Then, buy one of everything in the store.

You don't need any tools, what you need is knowledge and connection with the Gods.      I suggest you start reading as much as you can about Wicca, and get out in nature to start experiencing that connection.     Good luck in your journey and Blessed Be!|`|UxooffHZaa	Take a walk in the woods. Pick up stones that speak to you. Break off a branch for a wand. Collect some water from a stream.

Its an earth based faith. After a while, there may be tools you want to get but there is nothing essential needed to start understanding. It wasn't all that long ago that we made everything we needed... So, don't trap yourself in the things that merely attempt to copy what you find in nature.    I can cast circle with a stick, lighter, rock and spit.              ..and I don't really even need those.

But what does the Bible say about your question?    Romans 5:6  You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.  7  Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.  8  But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.    Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.    If God despised us then He wouldn't have sent his dear son Jesus whom He loves to die on our behalf.|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Not all of us....  Just you.    Come on.

Think about it.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	No, not at all as hypocrisy comes quite naturally to those not looking to Jehovah God for answers, but who are haughty and puffed up with pride; very egotistical, giving a false impression about themselves while proving less to righteous conduct.    The Greek word rendered hypocrite means one who answers, as well as meaning a stage actor.     Greek and Roman actors employed large masks with mechanical devices for amplifying the voice. Hence, the Greek word hypokrites came to be used in a metaphoric sense to apply to one playing false, or one putting on a pretense. The same word appears in the Greek Septuagint at Job 34:30; 36:13. Hypocrites are unfaithful ones (compare Luke 12:46 with Mt 24:51), and hypocrisy as used in the Scriptures, may also denote wickedness and cunning. (Compare Matthew 22:18; Mark 12:15; Luke 20:23; see also Galatians 2:13)    Jesus Christ identified as hypocrites persons who make gifts of mercy with showy display, who pray and fast to be seen of men, and who pick on the strawlike faults of their brothers but do nothing about removing their own rafterlike faults. Christ classified as such those who claimed to be Gods servants but who failed to discern the significance of the time in which they were living and the events that were occurring, while readily drawing conclusions from the appearance of earth and sky as to what the weather would be like. (Matthew 6:2, 5,?16; 7:1-5; Luke 6:42; 12:54-56)    Not only did the Son of God while on earth denounce the religious leaders of Israel as hypocrites but he also stated his reasons for doing so. They rendered mere lip service to the Creator, making the word of God invalid because of their traditions. (Mattew 15:1, 6-9; Mark 7:6,?7) Their actions were out of harmony with their words. (Matthew 23:1-3) The scribes and Pharisees not only deliberately refused to avail themselves of the opportunity to enter the Kingdom of the heavens, but they added to their sin by trying to hinder others from doing so. They put forth every effort to convert someone, only to make him twice as much a subject for Gehenna as they were. They were sticklers for the little things of the Law but disregarded the weightier matters of itjustice, mercy, and faithfulness. As hypocrites, they possessed only a seemingly clean outward appearance; inside they were full of immoderateness. Like whitewashed graves, outwardly beautiful, they appeared righteous to men, but inside they were full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. They built the graves of the prophets and decorated the memorial tombs of the righteous ones, claiming that they would not have shed the blood of such ones. However, their course of action proved them to be just like their murderous forefathers. (Matthew 23:13-36) The teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees was actually hypocrisy. (Matthew 16:6,?12; Luke 12:1; see also Luke 13:11-17)  ----------------------    The world is full of hypocrites:    1) Politicians  2) False Religious Leaders  3) Bush  4) News Media  5) Common Everyday People  6) Liars  7) People who perform unnatural acts  8) Revilers  9) Racist Pukes  10) Adulterers and Fornicators  11) Extortioners  12) Those Who Cheat On Their Taxes  13) Persons who profess to Love God But their Filthy Lifestyles Show Otherwise    The list is neverending.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	You're smarter than the average troll, I'll give you that...

Life is not sane, and neither is man.  Man constantly strives to  to make sense out of the insanity of it all.  Man attempts to, and in some cases has to justifies his actions as a result of having to succeed at the demise of the next man.   It all very parasites like really  There is no such thing as race or religion, thats just man categorizing in order to recognize.   Homa sapians wiped out other intelligent bipeds many thousands of years ago.   What we have right now are culture clashes as a result of many mind sets being colloquial, uneducated and indoctrinated.  I.E. Living in our own little world    It's all still very insane as long as primitive mans ego needs to invent where he came from in order to know where he is going. never mind know what he is doing.   Maybe this will always be so.    We are a perpetually, accentuating product of environmental circumstance that has no choice other than to do onto others as was done onto us without incurring some damage and knowledge upon ourselves.  We learn and then perpetuate our behavior whilst exhibiting our hierarchical status, this is what we know as culture.

If you only do a little research, you'll understand what makes someone a christian is not whether you're catholic, protestants, or denominations within us. What qualifies a person to be a servant of Christ is that, "He has faith in the son of God, and He hears His voice and Follows the master".    But your intent is not to seek real answers. As George Mcdonald said, "give truth to those who love it not is to give them a more multiply reasons for misinterpretation". Ask questions but don't be ignorant because there are many people who don't do their homework in here and they may take your question seriously.

But, he says, It has gotten better. And we should never deny that its gotten better.     But things havent gotten better for Black people in this country. They have gotten worse. The net worth of an average white family is more than ten times the net worth of an average Black family. $67,000 compared to $6,166 (National Urban League Report: The State of Black America 2005). This is the same as the ratio in 1990. The rate of incarceration for Black men has risen to the point where today one in nine Black men aged 25 to 29 is in jail or prison. In 2003 Black infant mortality (the number of babies who die before their first birthday) was 13.6 per 1,000 birthsalmost 2.5 times higher than the rate of 5.7 for whites (childstats.gov). Public schools are becoming more racially segregated (Civil Rights Project UCLA) and this is likely to accelerate with the 2007 Supreme Court decision that reversed Brown v. Board of Education.    $116 million from FEMA was spent on restoring the New Orleans Superdome and $60 million on restoring the Morial Convention Center, and $37 million was spent on building a new parking garage for luxury cruise boats leaving the port of New Orleans. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands live in toxic trailers with little hope of returning to the city, hospitals and schools are unopened years later, while the city bulldozes public housing to make sure that poor Black people cannot return.    Hurricane Katrina (and all that has happened since) has revealed two basic facts. First, that there is a large section of Black people still bitterly oppressed and impoverished by the very workings of the system. Second, that these basic workings of the system are reinforced and intensified by conscious government policy with genocidal implications.   This country was founded on slavery and genocide, and these played a decisive role in building up the wealth of this country. Even after slavery was formally ended, the oppression of Black people played a crucial economic role both in the North and the South. Today, Black people are locked in a caste-like system which is built into the operation of capitalism in this county. Political and social relations of white supremacy are built into the system at every level and are reinforced by and reinforce the economic relations.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	Social services are not only for black people and they have nothing to do with achieving racial equality. Nobody ever argued what you claim was the argument.  Everyone should do it on their own but not everyone can. Social services are there to help people, black or white, who can't make it without assistance.

AA11156135	Being 'natural' is the lowest form of humanity.    But on Animal Planet, - I saw tiger cubs suckling at a labrador retriever. Just because something 'happens' with animals, - doesn't mean it's natural, - or means that it's by God's original design.    After all, sin and the fall of Adam and Eve tainted all of creation. It made everything 'deviant' from God's original design.    BTW: A psychologist may say that it's natural for me to want to see my offender fed thru a meat grinder for a perceived offense against me.

The Wikipedia article linked below includes a list of some of the species found to exhibit homosexual behavior as well as an explanation of what "homosexuality" means when referring to animals.    As far as instability goes, homosexual behavior seems fairly widespread in the animal kingdom, and homosexuality doesn't seem to be driving these species to extinction.    Bottom line:  Since nobody has come up with a convincing explanation of how homosexuality is "taught" to gulls, bison, or flies (as opposed to being a natural condition), and humans are animals as well, then it is reasonable to presume that homosexual behavior in humans is also biological in nature.|`|283tO9j9aa	Yep, it certainly is biological. So far we know that people and animals can be born gay, but there are several hypotheses about what happens in the womb. It could be genetic, or it could be hormone levels. We're not sure. But no, gay people aren't unstable, not in terms of their bodies- you might get the occasional crazy gay person but it's nothing to do with their sexuality!    Animals that I know of that can be gay are: bonobos (pygmy chimps), various monkeys, penguins, swans, ducks, cattle (bulls especially), sheep. I think any animal, especially mammals, could be gay. I'm fairly sure I've seen a lesbian horse, but I can't say for sure!    Gay penguins mate for life like straight penguins, and they adopt orphaned chicks. Aww ^_^|`|BrjyljGIaa	Humans ARE animals.

Put aside you prejudice for a moment and consider it objectively. Your assumptions shine through your diction.

(for real!) and iron a sharp crease down the fronts of the legs.|`|NFY4A1csaa	One of my friends always did just that when she bought a new pair of jeans.

She always bought the boy's style.  The only ones available for girls zipped up the side.  Actually, that style was comfortable.|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	Yes I did it. I was a teen in the 70's and that's what we did. Then we would lay across the bed after putting on our jeans and take a cloths hanger to zip them up. I think our jeans were a little tight LOL.

iHDYncuXaa	Who said it was bad? According to this definition, fundamentalists are right on!    Fundamentalist Christianity, also known as Christian Fundamentalism or Fundamentalist Evangelicalism, is a movement that arose mainly within British and American Protestantism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among conservative evangelical Christians, who, in a reaction to modernism, actively affirmed a fundamental set of Christian beliefs: the inerrancy of the Bible, Sola Scriptura, the virgin birth of Christ, the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and the imminent personal return of Jesus Christ.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	Why on earth would you say they are the only ones who truly believe in God?  Nonsense.    Typically, people have an issue with fundamentalists because they try to get their beliefs made into laws to be forced upon everyone else.

With out fundamentalist religious principles, the fundies would be like fish out of water. Fundamentalism is oxygen to the fundies.

For an answer I would cite the genocide of Jews, Christian-Muslim conflicts, Muslim terrorism, Christian-Jew aberrations, Iraq war, Israel-Arab hostilities are all fall outs of religious fundamentalism.|`|BKPnG6HKaa	Extremism is bad because it brings violence.|`|8DRzJEfpaa	fundamentalism is basically a fear of change and modernism.

4b21006f14999f52b2e85e092542486baa	For Anglicans and Catholics (and others), Easter is not just Easter Sunday. It includes the whole week before, called Holy Week, and, liturgically, several weeks afterwards.    Holy week starts with Palm Sunday ( the Sunday before Easter) which commemorates Christ arriving in Jerusalem and being welcomed by the people. On the Thursday (Holy Thursday) we remember the Last Supper with a service which usually includes a "foot washing " ceremony.    On Good Friday there is a solemn service in remembrance of Christ dying on the Cross. It usually includes a reading of the story of Christ's death on the cross - the Passion. It is a day of fasting.    On the Saturday night, traditionally near midnight but these days often a bit earlier, there is the greatest service of the church year - the Easter Vigil - in RC churches a Mass. This includes readings from the OT, Psalms and the telling of the gospel story of the Resurrection. Lots of singing, renewal of baptismal promises etc. etc. (There are those who have a party afterwards and stay up till dawn, but they're a bit mad).    On Easter Sunday itself there is usually a very early service, the Mass (or Communions) of Easter Dawn in which the finding of the empty tomb features.    Most Christians will go to one or the other - the keen ones might do both. Most people will then have a good family meal together, exchange Easter eggs etc. etc. In more Catholic countries, there are often processions, plays and other celebratory events but, due to the reformation and puritan influence, these are not common in the USA or UK.|`|HUQQzph2aa	In addition to giving out easter baskets with cany and coloring easter eggs we go to to Church.     Also, we have family over for dinner.

In a way the male is paying a bride price.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Yes, since with wedding rings, the bride and groom are expected to split the cost of both rings.|`|xnsU60hhaa	Yes, if you got her a cheap $1000 ring, she has every right to get you a cheap one too!|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I'm sorry...but I don't understand the question...nor why it is in Etiquette.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	only if she has the funds to do so|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Since you ask the question, the answer most obviously is NO you can't.

Individual women maybe fair minded, even hard workers and generous, but it isn't PC to expect gender equality to have anything to do with what they "should do".      For Lost, if a couple were going to spend their lives together, as equals, would it make more sense to each have equal value rings?  What does "if she can afford it" have to do with anything of such a small amount as $1000?  Maybe they should each have $500 rings and each pay, or $100 ??  Women think the man should buy the lady expensive things, that is the answer.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	If that is the kind of price you would look for. I personally think it's a waste of money.

I don't know how people can look at how amazing and awesome the universe is, and then just claim that it happened all by chance. It just doesn't make sense to me.   And to Him it wasn't work.

DZzBfzVeaa	First you have to change it legally then worry bout all the little places. Go to your local Social security office. You will need you current social card, your licenses and  your marriage certificate and sometimes they need a birth certificate. This is your first stop and need to get a new social here before you can change anything else! After you get your new social (its usually free) you need to go to your local BMV (Beurer of motor vehicles. Tell them you need a new license because you changed your name. You will need your new social (with your new name on it) then you will need to also show them your old license and your marriage certificate. After you have your new license and new social you can start calling and telling people your new name. Change it with all your credit card companies etc. When you go to your doc office you will need to bring in your new id's and show them and they will change it. To change your name on your bank account its a little more complicated! You usually need to go in and sit down with a person that works there and show them your new 2 forms of id and your marriage certificate and they will change it in the computer and you gotta sign some papers for it. its kind a hassle!|`|hVuPqHzsaa	By Deed Poll, through a Solicitor.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Technically, you can CALL yourself by any name you want, and just keep signing your current name when writing checks and such.    But if you insist on making it all nice and legal, you'll need to go down to your local county courthouse and fill out the necessary paperwork.  You'll also need to apply for a new social security card, for the sake of your future benefits and your employers and whatnot.  It costs a few bucks to file the papers, but it won't break the bank.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	In my state, only a Judge can legally change your name.

4d575551fd062080e224b38d13ccd271aa	We just attended a Flag Retirement ceremony at Ed Bryant  Scout Reservation Camp in Mauston, Wisconsin. (EBSR)  (I have a Wolf Scout and a Bear Scout) It was during a Jack-O-Lantern Jamboree outing. It was very cool.<br>  <br>  They had four scouts hold each corner of the flag. We said the Pledge of Allegience to it one last time. Then the older Boy Scout (Eagle?) recited some words of praise, honor and glory. We were all to say words that came to mind in honor of the flag. (Like valor, freedom, etc.) Then the young boy scouts walked the flag over a fire pit, (There were four fire pits burning) and the older scout made sure that the ends were in the fire. It was very moving, and it brings tears to my eyes as I write.<br>  <br>  The scout said that the metal grommets in the flags bring good luck. We asked if we could have one, and he fished some out of the fire pit for all the young scouts.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6c3729508219871614d50e95fbbcdd18aa	Only Boy Scouts and the Military can burn a flag.

Viewing is more to speak with friends, comfort the family personally, and do your closure with the deceased.    The funeral is the religious or secular service, the formal and final good bye.    As is often the case, I'm completely at odds with the other answerers.  Funerals are what the general public, the acquaintances of the family ALWAYS attend.  Viewing is a more personal thing,  usually with the body there, and open casket, a small room, people coming and going.  It isn't a service.  The funeral is what one would attend.      However, do as you please, people answer questions in this forum having no experience in life or in etiquette, it's unfortunate that you can't tell whether you are getting information from an adult for a teeny-bopper.

F4IjI9qaaa	Manners seem to have become old fashioned - a thing of the past for many. What a shame. How can we make manners retro chic?    I'm a big "thank you" sayer because I think someone's efforts should be recognized. It makes others feel good to have someone recognize the extra effort they made to be nice. If I hold a door for someone and they just walk through without a word, I pleasantly say "you're welcome" in a voice loud enough for them to hear. If they look at me, I just smile. Maybe they'll thank the next person.    THANK YOU for the question : )|`|GznItj4saa	My parents were both very dignified and intellectual people so I was brought up to be a lady. I see that common politeness is very often reduced or forgotten about (and I am quite sure it does not seem like it to me because I am a snob). Between friends it is okay but all too often it carries on to people whom you are not close to or even business relationships. I think it is a matter of upbringing. Even if people are very easygoing I believe they should at least have knowledge of basic etiquette even if they don't think they will ever use it. You may never know when that might change.|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	Absolutely! I work with mostly grade 8 students and i never hear it! And I ask them what they are missing from that sentence and they have no idea.

No one says excuse me or thank you anymore.    People let doors close on other people....we talk loud on cell phones not caring if anybody wants to hear the conversation or not.    I think it's sad and I also believe when people don't have manners society collapses.|`|0FwVGYEYaa	yes , i do my best to correct my kids when they forget but it happens so much ,i dont want ppl to think i am raising children with out manners|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Not me per say but I have been in many situations where strangers don't have the common courtesy to say "thank you" when they should (i.e. I hold the door for them, I hold the elevator for them, etc.)
4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Real religion increases the light so that a person is better able to see their way, so in that sense, it does make life easier.    BUT, and this is a big but, the religion we see these days does not increase the light, so does NOT make life easier.

Religion is supposed to give a person hope that everything will work out for good according to a masterful purpose. It doesn't mean it will be nice and fair with no troubles. In fact it says that it will be just the opposite. The only guarantee will be a heavenly reward if the rules are followed exactly.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	Human is a traveller in this world.The religion shows him/her the safe and easy way of this travel.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  SO MY RELIGION DOES MAKE MY LIFE EASIER FOR SURE, LEAST OF ALL REASONS, IT GIVES MY LIFE A REASON AND A GOAL, AND PROMISES ME OF ANOTHER BETTER ETERNAL LIFE.  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|t3W4h59haa	No. Religion makes me very hard.|`|81SiImlSaa	Thankfully I learned long ago to put away childish things like religion.|`|nCTVuX9qaa	I have no religion... and it actually make my life easier...

Rather than thinking that an all good all powerful god created it for me and other humans but allow us to suffer horrifically|`|TQge2oBVaa	Yes. It gives me a reason to be as good and as selfless of a person as I possibly can. I don't care about going to Heaven per-se, but being a Catholic makes that the goal I have for how selfless I attempt to be. But I am also prepared to give the ultimate sacrifice and give my spot (if I earn it) in Heaven to someone else who deserves it. It overall keeps me away from things that harm me and others around me, which ultimately makes life easier because I don't have to deal with side-effects of bad decisions.     What most Athiests don't realise is that Christian based religions are more like guidlines to living the most selfless life you can. They aren't strict rulebooks, and evil corrupt politician-like gods controlling your life. And I know from experience, the happiness you get from helping someone else is worth more than any other thing that can be given to you.|`|AA10239241	Easier -- no.  More bearable -- yes. I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me.  My Roman Catholic faith sustains me.

And, yes, God does make my life easier. not easy, but easier. Life is hard but with God it's easier to get through hard times. I can always call on Him for help, and I know He does hear me and cares about whatever I'm going through, even if it seems like a "little" thing.|`|3YzXWHwbaa	My belief system makes my life easier.

LjsRfaskaa	Yes it is real. Your sister will not be the same again because she has come face to face with death and an understanding of things.    What we all have to realise is that we are not a physical body with spritual aspiration. That is the illusion. We are a spiritual being whos frequency has condensed into solid matter. The lower and denser the frequency the heavier and more solid we get.  But where your sister has gone the frequencies are pure and resonates with our spiritual true self, healing her from the inside. She wanted to come back, so she did and she has literaly seen the light. :)     Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	If she thinks it was real, then it is real to her.

There were too many who didn't know each other and had never heard of such a story who spoke of the same experience.  So, I am inclined to believe you sister.  And the proof is in the puddin', it had enough of an impact on her the change her ways.|`|peFtORvUaa	Near death experiences are real.    Logical people will try to kill it with logic.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Near death experiences appear to be real, and very often the person undergoes a really remarkable change that cannot be explained and often become quite spiritual.    There is a widening of perspective and a different and more spiritual way of seeing things, in many of the cases documented.    We can't really know if this is universal and happens to everyone at death.       If it is a biological process that doesn't really explain why the person comes back so changed and seems to view the world so differently.    It is always a positive experience for people.  I have yet to hear of someone who viewed the experience negatively and wished it hadn't happened.        .|`|AA11225089	I believe it was real.

Firstly there is resuscitation where your heart stops beating and you "die" then there is remaining in a coma, in olden days your were dead but with the equipment we have now we can keep people in a state of "sleep" while their body recovers from massive trauma.  There is a Doctor called Dr. Maurice Rawlings, MD, a heart surgeon, has written a number of books on the death experience and clearly shows from his own practise and from the experiences of his patients, that not everyone goes to the light when they die, where there is total love.  Many of his patients, after being resuscitated on the operating table, spoke about hell. SO he is the expert on the subject and if you'd like to hear more of what he has to say go to Spiritlessons, scroll down and find Doctor Rawlings, ha has recorded thousands of testimonies by his patients and HE was an atheist till he heard what people had to say.  It is really hair raising to listen too!!

HNLcHb65aa	Dramaturgy is the art of dramatic composition and the representation of the main elements of drama on the stage.  Some dramatists combine writing and dramaturgy when creating a drama. Others work with a specialist, called a dramaturge, to adapt a work to the stage.    Dramaturgy can also be defined, more broadly, as shaping a story or like elements into a form that can be acted. Dramaturgy gives the work or the performance a structure. More than actual writing, a dramaturge's work can often be defined as designing.|`|QIXxIXfLaa	i don't know

He believed in the one true God, Jehovah (Yahweh, the Lord, etc), and he was a simple man, living a simple man's life, obeying Jehovah God (the Lord) whenever God gave him instructions.  In fact, it is stated that his righteousness was based on the fact that he BELIEVED Jehovah God, not based on anything he did.  But he was NOT a prophet.

In the books of 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles, the threashing field of Araunah, a place purchased by David and used to build an alter, is identifed as being on Mount Moriah.  Its exact location is still debated by scholars and archeologist.    A common Jewish tradition places it as the location where David's son Solomon would eventually build his Temple.  Today it would be the location of the Muslim mosque, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.  But as it was a "threshing field" when David purchase it, it is unlikely to have been within the city of Jerusalem, as the location of the Temple was at the time it was build.    It is more likely that it would have been outside the old city of Jerusalem.  That would have placed it in the mountain range where the traditional site of the Crucifixion happened.

KS2OHXCRaa	In the beginning he was slave to Arthur Shelby.     Shelby sold him and he was bought by Augustine St Clare.     St Clare intended to set Tom free but he died before he could and his wife reneged on the promise, selling him to Simon Legree.     George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) intended to buy him from Legree and to set him free but was too late as Legree ordered a couple of overseers to kill Tom.
ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	I feel that physician assisted suicide has a place. There are people that are terminally ill and will never get better and they are only waiting to die. Someone has to do everything for them- get their groceries, make their meals, clean up after them. I personally can't imagine having a loved one go through that and knowing that my final memories of them will be of them not being able to care for themselves. Especially when that period of time can go on for months. It's hard enough having someone die in a hospital after being there for a day or two hooked up to tubes, but there was something before that. To be in a similar state for weeks or even months....    I know people that have switched from human medicine to animal medicine because at least animals can be put out of their misery and not have to suffer any more.     Physician assisted suicide does have an impact because we're currently in a state of mind where it is morally and ethically wrong to put a person to sleep the way you would an animal. Perhaps it's because some view suicide as a sin. Perhaps it's because people that no longer want to take of an animal have it put it down, so if you no longer want to take care of someone could you put them down as well? Maybe it's because humans are not animals like cats and dogs and euthanasia is treatment reserved for "animals". Maybe it's because there's this fear that euthanasia will not be reserved for the terminally ill who will only continue to get worse but that the emotionally depressed will seek it for themselves. Perhaps it's a combination of all of these. But whether physician assisted suicide is condemned or condoned it will say something about how we as a culture view humanity and the worth of an individual's like, no matter what condition they're living in.|`|XjLvbfTZaa	If we can put pets to sleep without their permission to do so, why can't we do the same for human beings who wish to end their suffering?

But with proper safeguards it can be a proper and rational choice to die at a time of one's choosing and before one has a lengthy painful illness or causes one's family  huge distress and trouble. But then I'm 74 and not so far from it as most of you!|`|6dP60V3zaa	I did a research paper on euthanasia when i was a freshman in college. I think if you are deathly ill and there is no cure in sight, you should have the right to end your life. but I think the person should be checked out by a doctor first to make sure they won't get better, b/c people who are suicidal and are not ill will take advantage of it|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	i think its ok. if that is what the person wants. at least it cant they can go easier, thank if they do something more dramatic themselves to commit suicide. like shoot themselves in the heard or something.|`|gM4exZNEaa	Euthanasia is completely fine. I think that if someone is in a lot of pain and they can't end it themselves, they should be able to ask for help without having to worry about that person getting in trouble.

I think the only advantage women have is that most of them grow up faster. They start talking when they're a little over 1year, and they talk well around 2 years. Most boys talk when around 3 years. Moreover, you can compare the complexity of a 16 years old girl's thinking process to that of a 20 - 22 years old boy.  That's why women think and rethink a situation before acting. Men call that cowardice, but they should grow up and realize that caution is better in any situation especially that they lack women's empathy.|`|547Ln6rNaa	I'm sure most people are good at something, but they mean academically, girls get better grades in school.

AA11622701	At the time when the gospels were written, "paper" was difficult to come by, and all books had to be hand copies, one copy at a time.  So it was normal for a biographer only to include events of major importance about a person's life in their writings.  Since the childhood of Jesus had no bearing on his teachings, a biographer from that time would see no reason to mention it.      If you read through the time that the gospels do cover in detail (the last four years of Jesus' life, you will find that there are gaps there also.  They tell of four major teaching cycles that Jesus made through Israel and the surrounding areas.  These are usually determined by different feast or seasons mentioned in the accounts.  But there are gaps between these cycles in which we are told nothing about what Jesus did.  Again, the writers did not consider them important as he was not teaching during those times, and exclude them.    Nobody ask why the gospels were not written on computers, because we realize the computers did not exist at that time.  They were not invented until recently.  Nobody ask why thousands of copies of the gospels were not printed within a few months Jesus death, because we realize that printing presses were not invented until the 1500s.      But people do ask why the gospels do not match modern ideas of how a biography should be written.  They do not realize that the concept of trying to detail every moment and every event in a person's life is something that did not come about until the 17th and 18th century.      Prior to that time, they only included in the major events, and were normally structured, not necessarily in chronological order, but in a way that showed the moral teaching that the author intended to extract from the person's life. Biographies were written as a teaching idea using the example of others.  The idea of writing a biography for the purpose of details every moment of a person's life is a very modern concept, and not found in the writings of Bible.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	It is not necessary for us to know.

Saint John wrote a few sketches on the last few weeks of Jesus life and then he bragged that the WHOLE WORLD HAS NO PLACE TO STORE ALL THE BOOKS THAT CAN BE WRITTEN ABOUT JESUS... but the other 3 Gospel writers had to copy from each other because they didn't know what else to write about Jesus!    John 21:25 (KJV) And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.     John 21:25 (NIV) Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.     THIS IS HOLY CRAP WRITTEN TO FEED THE GULLIBILITY OF LOW IQ CHRISTIANS...!!!  Hypocritical lies!|`|3gMytPXhaa	the life which one is important and useful to the human being is only given in the bible. In every persons autographs or biography only important thing or matter will be published in books. It is not possible to write each and every thing of any persons life history. If u tell your life history also u will miss or don't tell some thing in your life. u will tell only important things in your life only. so what jesus did in the gap or after the gap is not important. we have to think what jesus said to follow. we have to think whether the words said by jesus good or bad to human being. if good follow or if not don't. so, see the positive side of any person.|`|MED20HbPaa	Honestly? I just don't think it was very interesting. The bible said he was a carpenter. As the oldest child, he was expected to take over the family business. Many believe Joseph, his father, had died, so Jesus probably lived a fairly normal, bread-bearing life. His parables about simple things, such as farming and church-going life, attest to this.    It didn't really get interesting until he came out of the desert started his first ministry, and said his first words as a minister-- repent!.|`|AA10294565	Based on what little is known about those missing years, Jesus was a brat.  He apparently killed a bully and then brought him back to life just to teach him a lesson.  The writings probably exist somewhere in the Vatican Vaults, but some information is out there.  I recommend doing some more research.  There are lots of passages about the missing years, it's just that most of them are fragmented or cut short.  Just because it's not in the bible doesn't mean it did not "happen".|`|yHfsHp6naa	Because the more that was made-up, the less people would believe it, and fact-checking would be much harder.

Blockage of carotid artery may cut off the blood supply to the brain cells, which results in stroke (cerebral thrombosis). Blood thickening and clotting are also serious smoking effects and smokers are 1.5 times more likely to have stroke as compared to non-smokers.    Eyes    Dangerous smoking effects on eyes include common eye diseases such as Graves' ophthalmopathy, age- related macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataract. The worst smoking effect on eyes can be permanent blindness.    Nose    Smoking effects on your nose can rob you of your sense of smell.    Teeth and Gums    Do you ever wonder why your teeth are so yellow and stained? Do your gums bleed every morning you wake up? Well, it's because of the direct smoking effect on your teeth. Also smoking effects are not limited to the appearance of your teeth but also results in plaque, loose teeth, gum disease and gingivitis.    Mouth and Throat    All cancers associated with the larynx, oral cavity and esophagus are fatal smoking effects. The less dangerous smoking effects are reduced sense of taste, sore throat and smelly breath.    Hands    Poor blood circulation which leads to cold fingers, tar stained fingers, peripheral vascular disease and amputation due to gangrene are some of the heart-wrenching smoking effects.    Lungs and Respiratory System    The most dreaded lung cancer, feeling out of breath, colds and flu, pneumonia, asthma, cough and sputum, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, phew... are all smoking effects which will more or less make your life hell.    Heart    Two immediate smoking effects on heart and circulation are an increase in your heartbeat rate and a sharp rise in blood pressure.    Long term smoking effects are increase in the blood cholesterol and fibrinogen levels and increase in chances of having a heart attack. Smoking effects on your heart leads to coronary heart disease, aneurysm, peripheral vascular disease, stroke etc.    Digestive System    Smoking effects are heartburn, peptic ulcers, Crohn's disease, gallstones and stomach cancer.    Skin    Wrinkles, capillaries and premature ageing and scarring are few smoking effects on skin.    Legs and Feet    Beurger's disease, leg pain and gangrene are painful smoking effects.|`|KrqGoxoUaa	it can damage your aviola   damage your lungs  you can get mouth, tounge, throat, lung,brain cancer|`|AA12187539	Wow!  The reasons are infinite!  It would be much harder to find some reasons why people SHOULD smoke.    Here are some reasons they shouldnt:    1.  Their own health.  2.  Death by emphazima (it is a horrible way to die and is not quick at all)  3.  Do they want to be wheeled around in a wheelchair with an oxygen tank their last months or years on earth?  4.  It endangers other peoples health.  Unless someone is smoking outside in open air and downwind from non-smokers, innocent people are being exposed to their poisonous smoke.  5.  It stinks!  Smoking really smells horrible.  It gets in peoples clothes and in their hair.  It affects the taste of food.  I think someone smoking in a restaurant is as offensive as if I went over next to their table, dropped my pants, and went poo poo right next to their food.  6.  Smoking in a car devalues the car.  It is much harder to sell a car for a good price if someone was smoking in it.  7.  Smoke breaks in the work place cut down on productivity.  Smokers need to have time to smoke, and that is time lost from work.  If smokers dont get a chance to smoke, they become irritable and distracted.  8.  Travelling is much more difficult for smokers, because they pretty much cant smoke on planes or even inside the airports anymore.  I think it is pretty much the same on trains and busses.    I hope this helps a bit!|`|qslROmIMaa	cancer, hurt you/ kill you.   think about your lungs  My Point Of View:  if your the smoker your getting 1st hand smoke, usally your around people who smoke too, or you breath what you just puffed out. in my point of view thats 1st and 2nd hand smoke. not to mention tons of people smoke. plus. think 3rd hand smoke. you wouldnt want that, too would you?  3rd hand smoke is when you put out your cigarette, & your & the things left over, i forgot exactly. just look it up. & you wouldnt want young children or anyone to get cancer, 2nd hand & 3rd hand smoke would you?|`|AA10302860	Man...that's a tough one.

G52fLaxWaa	Read Kumaraa's answer      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Now the first thing we all should ponder on that why the authors Shree Valmiki in his Ramayan (the primal version) & Maharishi Ved Vyas in Adhyatma Ramayan didnt modify the manner in which King Bali was killed by Shree Ram, since it was not fitting to the stature of one like Him. The authors very well knew that people would criticize Shree Ram for this & would obviously call Him a coward, since He shot an arrow at Bali from hiding & that too when Bali was busy fighting with his brother. They could have very easily substantiated that Shree Ram Himself challenged King Bali instead of Sugreev & cut his head off with His Sudarshan Chakra. But why they didnt ? This itself proves that there was a profound reason behind this & not that Shree Ram was a coward.    Ok we all know Bali was Adharmic in having driven out his younger brother Sugreev who was to be treated as his own son and in having taken his wife for sam-bhogam, but why Shree Ram didnt kill him by confronting him ? The issue is not why He killed. It is why He killed while not being in direct combat. Though Bali accuses Shree Ram initially, but he gets convinced later that Shree Ram was perfectly Dharmic in His action.    Let us analyse the scenario step by step. When Bali was wounded by Shree Rams arrow he asked Shree Ram before dying, he didnt offend Him in any way in His country or His town. He didnt humiliate Him in any way, he had been innocent and that he had not done any Apraada (offence) to Shree Ram . Just by applying logic found in this defence of Bali, shall we say that had he not offended Shree Ram, if not in Shree Rams place, but in his own place (Balis territory) and humiliated Shree Ram in some way, could Shree Ram had given him the end in the way as it was ? In order to understand the nuances, let us remind ourselves that there was no going back on killing Bali as far as Shree Ram was concerned. The moment He went around the fire and pledged to Sugreev that he would kill Bali, Balis fate was sealed. So the issue was not why He killed. The question whether Bali committed any offence or not as to attract a death sentence from Shree Ram is irrelevant (based on the pledge that Shree Ram gave to Sugreev). But that he was killed in a particular fashion alone gets connected with some cause, probably an offence to Shree Ram.    As until long Bali was not in any way connected with Him, the offence must have taken place later. Since the killing was in an indirect mode, the offence must also have been in an indirect mode. If we proceed with this line of reasoning, we get ample evidence to show that Bali had indeed offended Shree Ram in an indirect way. He seemed to have come into grasp of this indirect offence gradually as he continued to talk to Shree Ram. One can see a palpable shift in Balis tone from being accusative to submissive thereby indicating that wisdom had dawned on him slowly and lately. It starts with Balis talks on Raj-Dharma. As he continued to speak of Raj-Dharma, Shree Rams commitment to Dushtah nigraha sishta paripaalanam sinks in his mind and wonders You have to do something, but You have done some other thing. What is that something and some other thing is again spelt by Bali himself.    You have failed to show Your paraakram on the one who had offended You, namely Ravan, but instead You have shown Your paraakram on me who had not offended You Is Bali right when he said that he had not offended Shree Ram ? Bali himself does not think so.For he proceeds to ask (unprovoked) If only You have asked me to restore Sita Ji, I would have got her back within a day. If only You had approached me, I would have killed Ravan in combat, pulled him to You and got back Sita Ji. If only You had commanded me I, like Hayagreeva who restored Vedas from Madu-Kaidapa, would have gone after Ravan, searched for Sita Ji even if She had been hidden inside the oceans, and restored Her back to You.    So Bali himself thinks that there is some cause for grouse by Shree Ram about him. Bali knows what Shree Ram requires. He had not risen to the occasion. Why should he,is the question that comes to our mind. In what way he is bound to help Shree Ram when Shree Ram had not sought his help. This is the message conveyed by Bali.    He thinks that because of his not rising to the occasion, Shree Ram had killed him unseen. He expresses this in his talk(that continues from the above mentioned one). It is perfectly legitimate for Sugreev to aspire for the throne after me. It is perfectly legitimate for him to kill me to attain the throne. But Shree Ram, it is not legitimate on Your part to hit me when I am fighting with another, says Bali. If you think it is legitimate, tell me how, says Bali before he collapses.    So the issue now centres around whether Shree Ram considered the non-rising to the occasion of Bali as an offence. The answer is yes, going by what Shree Ram says in the beginning and at the end of his defence. Shree Ram replies that He had been perfectly Dharmic in what He had done, by this does He points out to Bali that he had failed to carry out the Dharma in his (Balis) land? Bali spoke of all Raj-Dharma that included protecting the Dharma in ones land and punishing the offenders. Did he follow that Raj-Dharma? He knew that Sita Ji had been abducted. He knew the one who had abducted her was once defeated by him. He was more valiant than the abductor and could have easily overpowered him if he had made an attempt. Further the abduction was carried out in a land that belonged to him and Sita Ji was carried across his kingdom. Sugreev had seen the abduction. So did Bali & Hanuman Ji. Sugreev did not do anything to stop the mishap, he being incapable of doing that, he was a coward. Ok the only two persons of course besides Shree Ram, who were capable|`|M2vrjRy8aa	In any case he got mukti bcos of that so what does it matter anymore whether dharma or adharma lol..maybe there could be another story behind it|`|xF8TvlhYaa	This is the question being asked from the days of the killing of Vaali.Okay!Sri Rama was born as a human.

Because the corners stick out too far, it won't fit even though the size is right.    Similarly, it isn't a matter of giving them facts if the mental framework within which information is to be integrated doesn't permit those facts. For many believers, if "God created man and woman," then they won't accept that human beings are the direct descendants of previous hominids that have gone extinct. The information that says otherwise simply isn't correct, or it isn't inapplicable. It is rejected because the information is processed through and evaluated by a pre-existing framework.    We all have such a framework; we can't live without it. If I said that gravity was a god grabbing us and pulling us to the ground, a Naturalist (which many of the most outspoken Atheists of the world are) would reject this, not because they can show me gravitons (which, to my knowledge, we've never observed anyway), but because I didn't explain the phenomenon in naturalistic terms. The framework used to evaluate the information provided rejects the claim.     What is needed is not just a presentation of the information to date; they can ignore it all without feeliny any sort of intellectual discomfort. What is needed would be a philosophical change that leads to a structure that can readily accept and integrate this sort of information...but reaching people at this level of their thinking process is fantastically difficult, how people think isn't always spelled out clearly, and it triggers a lot of defensiveness.|`|O1QBA5XSaa	The willfully ignorant will not listen to science, much less us.

That is craziness   And yet through faith and obedience I do it or at least I try to, It is much easier now that it use to be, but that is because I saw the fruit of the why a few times (not all but some) and when people hate me or mock me yeah I force myself to pray blessings to them and I force myself to love on them even when they spit on me (literally sometimes) and in return I buy them a gift or ask them if they have a need or hug them or just go home and fall on my face and pray for them and yeah it is hard but it is worth it, not only for myself and how it changes me but for the seed it plants for the Lord and because I know I am being obedient, I dont know why it works or how it works but I stand firm on faith and on the promises of God that He will do what He says He will do.     Sadly God is not concerned with my happiness and comfort all the time, sometimes He has a purpose that is greater than I, I, I  and me, me, me He sees the beginning from the end and I dont I am finite and He is infinite so in the end I just do what He says and let Him worry about the rest     So yeah when I start off I dont love them but as I pray for them and press into them that call me enemy YES I begin to love them and then I love them. Love is an action word and agape is dependent on no one returning that love it is about knowing what is best for someone even when they dont see it, Loving someone when they are unlovable or dont even love themselves .

Sorry about this little rant, but I've seen them in ACTION.|`|W3vuQtRMaa	Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is actually a cultural practice in many Muslim countries, but it is not a requirement of Islam.  Many Muslims, however, erroneously believe they are doing it as a religious requirement, much like many American Christians erroneously believe MGM is a requirement of Christianity.  In the US, FGM of a minor is understandably illegal although minor males have no protection.  Many Muslims will argue that FGM is more hygenic, similar to the argument used for MGM.  There is the added "benefit" that it reduces sexual sensitivity, again like MGM.    But to answer your question, no I did not "know" that 200,000 US Muslim women would undergo circumcision this year.  If they are women, then they are adults and they have the right (both legal and natural) to make decisions about their lives.  If they are minors, then they are not women and their circumcisions would indeed be illegal.  If you're interested in this topic, however, you really should do some more research on it.  While I'll agree with you that FGM is a horrible practice, your information is really inaccurate.    But the bottom line is both FGM and MGM are forms of sexual mutilation.  Both should be illegal.  Both violate the rights of the child victim.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Did you know an AMERICAN just froze to death because he was poor and his electric was shut off?

If everything before the universe was spiritual as some people claim (how they can claim to know is beyond me), that would mean there would be no means of binding.

One of those limitations would be being trapped within a physical form.    So you take something without form, force it into a finite form, and taadaa! It can now be imprisoned.

Facial features are notoriously tough to measure by the way. In fact despite the "impression" we get of the common look of certain population actual statistical measure usually finds a greater degree of variation within a population than compared to a different population.    I do not fully understand it myself, but that is what the experts say.|`|GqTSa85daa	Sounds plausible.|`|d2lvgxJhaa	Sounds like utter rubbish.  Are you seriously arguing that Barack Obama doesn't have the right face to speak English?    Selection procedures for people that can better pronunciate "th" in English, for example?  Have you ever heard of a woman that sleeps with a man because she likes his consonants?  Given the very recent introduction of language over evolutionary timescales and the huge variation of facial features in populations and the fact that, for example, one missing tooth can radically alter the way an individual speaks.  I think what you are saying is utter nonsense.    You've got to be kidding me.  You have no idea about the amount of time that it takes evolutionary changes to work, and in any case, second generation Japanese Americans speak perfect American English for example.    The pace of mutation in language is far far far higher than the slow slow pace of mutation in evolution.  Note how different American, British and Australian English sound.  Many Australians are ethnically British, how does your childish hypothesis account for that.      How does your hypothesis account for the accents across languages.  There is huge variation in speech in the UK, the distance from Manchester to Liverpool is quite small, but linguistically they are far more different.  Genetic differences between Manchester and Liverpool are far less than linguistic ones.      In a certain context, your idiotic argument could be used to argue that people of color are never going to learn to speak English properly.  So your naive idea could be used for racist means.      Don't confuse genes and culture.  Many Spanish people have Arabic blood, and their language his certain Arabic traits, but the blood didn't carry the language.  The Arabs carried both independently.  People in South America, with no Arabic blood whatsoever, can speak Spanish perfectly well.    Are you beginning to feel the sense of ridicule that I am heaping on your idea yet?    Your vareity of naive theorizing was common in the years following Darwin by people who misunderstood and misapplied his ideas.  It took some of them to very dangerous places indeed.    I agree with gardener_girl's first sentence.|`|jTFdG8xqaa	I would think that this is reasonable to an extent. The question of course is how does Darwins theory affect their reproduction? If these people with stronger jaw muscles (ie better voice for their language) had more children than say the ones with weaker jaw muscles than natural selection makes sense. The problem is it is tough to correlate ones speaking ability directly to ones reproduction. A guy (especially now adays) who is good looking and well versed may very well "meet" more women, but he may not have more children than average joe weak jaw muscle man. So while i like your idea it seems a little thin.     What i would suggest is that perhaps the jaw muscles develop more strongly in the society where those kinds of muscles are necessary.   Because youth are speaking the language at a young age it makes sense that their jaw would be strong than one who speaks a language that does not require as much jaw movement. So the reason their jaws are strong is not hereditary but rather athletic jaw ability. Get it?|`|YoHroOcGaa	I have a big jaw and I speak both Spanish and English|`|jG7ejIZvaa	You are jerk. - japanese language is different than chinese language. they do not speak the same language, its like you compare swedish language to spanish language. I personally find japanese language sounded very smooth and delicate like a bird voice. Japanese has words that while they themselves do not carry gender, they are strongly associated with the language of men or women. Pronouns, honorific language and grammatical additions to sentences are designated for the use of only men or only women, and to consciously select against designated gender is transgressive to some degree. This tendency for gender-specific syntax has a supposedly long and esteemed tradition in Japan, and it is this tradition that continues to be invoked as a warning against impolite and uncouth behavior and language. However, despite this constant warning, Japanese women continue to explore the boundaries of their linguistic position, and how they can manipulate it someday to their advantage linguistically. As such, it seems useful to consider how womens language in Japan developed and exists currently.otherwise, japanese do not have large jaw or high cheeksbone. they tend to have weak jaw, narrow or round face. I been visited japan...........I rarely saw the one who have got large jaw.|`|46fouwFfaa	No, that does not make sense. Your logic is flawed. It is not according to Darwin's theories of evolution that clenching the jaw results in a stronger jaw, etc. He stated a few possible reasons as to why evolution or the change in a population's gene pool occurs.    The theory of adaptation and how species change through time follows three postulates:        * Struggle for existence: The ability of a population to expand is infinite, but the ability of any environment to support populations is always finite.        Example: Animals require food to grow and reproduce. When food is plentiful, animal populations grow until their numbers exceed the local food supply. Since resources are always finite, it follows that not all individuals in a population will be able to survive and reproduce.        * Variation in fitness: Organisms in populations vary. Therefore, some individuals will possess traits that enable them to survive and reproduce more successfully (producing more offspring) than others in the same environment.    (And whether or not someone has a "strong jaw" or not and whether their language has more relaxed sounds or not does not affect a person's survival).        * Inheritance of variation: If the advantageous traits (that help one live or reproduced) are inherited by offspring, then these traits will become more common in succeeding generations. Thus, traits that confer advantages in survival and reproduction are retained in the population, and traits that are disadvantageous disappear.    Your idea follows Lamarck's theory of inheritance. He believed that the use of a trait or disuse will determine whether or not that trait will exist or be improved in the next generation. An example is that because giraffes eat the leaves of tall trees, they stretch their necks up to eat some. So the use of their neck results in longer necks in the following generations. This led to the very long necks we see today in giraffes. However, Lamarck's theories are incorrect. Since your idea follows the same logic as Lamarck, it is also incorrect.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	You make a good point. I think it is entirely possible.|`|AA10873763	I think it would be the other way around; i.e., language develops in response to the facial features.  Asian languages are best suited to the Asian physiology, etc.  Language evolves much more quickly than humans do.  There have been no real changes in the human form since the advent of spoken language.

UZ0t2tz4aa	The Internet is a collaboration of computer networks and technology that started as a concept to link University colleges together then took off.  England and the US were the primary developers though both had unique approached and standards.   Eventually, the standards were unified.   The other reason was because fractual T1 networks in 1961, the backbone of the internet was not yet a public domain so bandwidth was limited to service providers.

WZNaNvplaa	Because people confuse the fact that the majority of Americans have professed to being Christian, with the idea that Christianity is a specially protected, privileged, or official religion of the State.     I've said it here before. Our Founding Fathers were mostly Christian, but included deists, atheists, and probably others. But they had the wisdom to see what had happened in Europe over the last three hundred years. People killing people for not only not being Christian, but for being the wrong type of Christian. They chose to ensure that the practice of religion was a personal, not a government option. And while that practice hasn't worked perfectly, it has worked well for us. Those who forget simply need to study theocracies, past and present, to see what a dark path they risk treading.|`|MI53mUKzaa	The pilgrims left England because they were not satisfied with the religious reforms that were introduced in England after the English Anglican Church separated from the Roman Catholic Church. The pilgrims could not take the pressure of the threats on their lived so they formed a congregation in the village of Scrooby in Nottinghamshire. They lived here for three years but had to leave. Their plans to settle in other villages in England failed, so they migrated to Leiden in the Netherlands, where they could practice religious freedom.    and our pledge says "One nation under God"|`|WjRqYf6naa	It is because it is not a completely black and white issue. The way I see it is that the Framers of the Constitution were, for the most part, Godly men who purposely founded a secular republic in order to guarantee a maximum of religious freedom of religious expression    The Jeffersonian wall of separation exists just as much to protect the Church from the State as to protect the State from the Church The people who wish to see the United States become a totally Christian nation would be most unpleasantly surprised to see the establishment of a brand of Christianity not their own.    Throughout history, the establishment of nominally Christian governments has tended to persecute other Christians as much as, if not more so, than non-Christians. The Inquisition is a case inpoint.    I think that we are probably best off the way things are.    *edit* Let me be the first to point out that no sooner had the Puritans left England to escape persecution for their beliefs than they began to persecute other Christians, such as Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson. It is also noteworthy that those who were executed as witches during the infamous incident at Salem were Christians and for the most part members of the church.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	Many of the settlers were Christian....|`|YyEEAJBkaa	It is convenient for them|`|AA11124121	The original settlers left England to get away from the persecution of Protestants...|`|LLey4VRzaa	The first settlers brought the Bible and Lived their Lives according to the Bible and our constitution is Based on the Bible.

Unlike they seem to believe, the Puritans were neither the first British settlers to America (the Virginians were and they were all there for money) nor the Founding Fathers (a group much more important for this debate than any of the early settlers).

On September 6, 1774 -- less than two years before the colonies formally declared independence from Great Britain -- the Continental Congress made its first official act a call for prayer. And on May 16, 1776, the Continental Congress appointed an official national day of fasting and prayer for the colonies:       The Congress....Desirous...to have people of all ranks and degrees duly impressed with a solemn sense of God's superintending providence, and of their duty, devoutly to rely...on His aid and direction...Do earnestly recommend Friday, the 17th day of May be observed by the colonies as a day of humiliation, fasting, and prayer; that we may, with united hearts, confess and bewailed our manifold sins and transgressions, and, by sincere repentance and amendment of life, appease God's righteous displeasure, and, through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, obtain this pardon and forgiveness.    The Continental Congress on September 11, 1777, ordered the importation of 20,000 Bibles for the American troops. The law read as follows:       The use of the Bible is so universal and its importance so great that your committee refers the above to the consideration of Congress, and if Congress shall not think it expedient to order the importation of types and paper, the Committee recommends that Congress will order the Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from Holland, Scotland, or elsewhere, into the different parts of the States of the Union.   Whereupon it was resolved accordingly to direct said Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 copies of the Bible.    Indeed, the Congress authorized its endorsement to be printed on the front page of the edition of the Bible approved for the American people:       Whereupon, Resolved, that the Unites States in Congress assembled...recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of the Unites States, and hereby authorize [Robert Aitken] to publish this recommendation in the manner he shall think proper.    The Continental Congress on October 18, 1780, issued another Proclamation for a Day of Public Thanksgiving and Prayer:       Whereas it hath pleased Almighty God, the Father of all mercies, amidst the vicissitudes and calamities of war, to bestow blessings on the people of these states, which call for their devout and thankful acknowledgments, more especially in the late remarkable interposition of his watchful providence, in the rescuing the person of our Commander-in-Chief and the army from imminent dangers, at the moment when treason was ripened for execution...     It is therefore recommended to the several states...a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, that all the people may assemble on that day celebrate the praises of our Divine Benefactor; to confess our unworthiness of the least of His favors, and to offer our fervent supplication to the God of all grace...to cause the knowledge of Christianity to spread over all the earth.        On July 13, 1787, the Continental Congress passed "An Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United States." This law was passed again by the United States Congress and signed into law by President George Washington on August 4, 1789:       Article III  Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall be forever encouraged.      --------------------------------------...|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Tom Paine said "A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right." They hear it and then never give it a second thought, even when they're given evidence to the contrary.    They probably heard it somewhere, from a parent or someone else. When they're taught the Constitution in school, I think they just aren't paying attention or they assume whatever they heard first is correct.    But, as is frequently quoted on this site, the Treaty of Tripoli states that "the United States in, in no sense, founded on the Christian religion". Why that simple statement doesn't clear things up for them, I'll never know.    Some of them just WANT it to be a Christian nation and aren't at all concerned about the truth. They figure if they repeat the lie often enough it will become truth.

Also the original British settlers were not there because of religious persecution they were settled by various companies and aristocrats. And if you are referring to the pilgrims, they first went to Holland where they escaped persecution but disliked foreigners then went to America. So it wasn't religious persecution that sent them there but xenophobia.|`|TKZAYJokaa	because they forgot they stole this country from the natives who were here first and they werent protestants, lol.|`|pbT0tJvqaa	Because some of us have studied history and the writings of our founding fathers. Here is the Library of Congress website that tells about the founding of this great country. You can see the original documents that the founding fathers and our first congress passed.     http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel...    IV. Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774-89   The Continental-Confederation Congress, a legislative body that governed the United States from 1774 to 1789, contained an extraordinary number of deeply religious men. The amount of energy that Congress invested in encouraging the practice of religion in the new nation exceeded that expended by any subsequent American national government. Although the Articles of Confederation did not officially authorize Congress to concern itself with religion, the citizenry did not object to such activities. This lack of objection suggests that both the legislators and the public considered it appropriate for the national government to promote a nondenominational, nonpolemical Christianity.     Congress appointed chaplains for itself and the armed forces, sponsored the publication of a Bible, imposed Christian morality on the armed forces, and granted public lands to promote Christianity among the Indians. National days of thanksgiving and of "humiliation, fasting, and prayer" were proclaimed by Congress at least twice a year throughout the war. Congress was guided by "covenant theology," a Reformation doctrine especially dear to New England Puritans, which held that God bound himself in an agreement with a nation and its people. This agreement stipulated that they "should be prosperous or afflicted, according as their general Obedience or Disobedience thereto appears." Wars and revolutions were, accordingly, considered afflictions, as divine punishments for sin, from which a nation could rescue itself by repentance and reformation.    The first national government of the United States, was convinced that the "public prosperity" of a society depended on the vitality of its religion. Nothing less than a "spirit of universal reformation among all ranks and degrees of our citizens," Congress declared to the American people, would "make us a holy, that so we may be a happy people."      Congressional Fast Day Proclamation  Congress proclaimed days of fasting and of thanksgiving annually throughout the Revolutionary War. This proclamation by Congress set May 17, 1776, as a "day of Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer" throughout the colonies. Congress urges its fellow citizens to "confess and bewail our manifold sins and transgressions, and by a sincere repentance and amendment of life, appease his [God's] righteous displeasure, and through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, obtain his pardon and forgiveness." Massachusetts ordered a "suitable Number" of these proclamations be printed so "that each of the religious Assemblies in this Colony, may be furnished with a Copy of the same" and added the motto "God Save This People" as a substitute for "God Save the King."    Here you can see the original document.  http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/f04...    Congressional Thanksgiving Day Proclamation  Congress set December 18, 1777, as a day of thanksgiving on which the American people "may express the grateful feelings of their hearts and consecrate themselves to the service of their divine benefactor" and on which they might "join the penitent confession of their manifold sins . . . that it may please God, through the merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of remembrance." Congress also recommends that Americans petition God "to prosper the means of religion for the promotion and enlargement of that kingdom which consisteth in righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.'"     Again you can see the original document  http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/vc0...    These are from the Library of Congress website. Not a Christian website, but a government website, they are not promoting religion, just recording the history of our country. Do some reading here, you will learn a lot about the people who founded this great country and how they held church services in congress building, the treasury building, and the supreme court building. Not exactly seperation of church and state. That did not come about until the late 1950's.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	because the founding fathers acknowledge it was.

And the obvious one.... they're brainwashed. They believe everything in that story book. I mean, they pick and choose what they believe. Because the only REAL Christian wouldn't be allowed to wear mixed-fiber clothing, eat shellfish, or have an animal as a pet (all of which are considered un-forgivable sins, in the bible).... And I personally don't know any Christian who doesn't do at least one of those, if not all.

AA11047076	OK- theres a difference between possession in a person and possession in a building.  In the Talmud in Masechta Berachos it discusses how Shedim (the least powerful of supernatural entities and used by Hashem to effect certain negative elements in the world) can inhabit buildings- specifically abandoned or remote buildings.    However they are easy to keep out or get rid off.  Mezuzot keep them out (or chase them out)- so if a house does nopt have Mezuzot just put them in.  If there are Mezuzot then check that they are all kosher.  Kabbalisticaly they are also chased away by the colour blue- which is why in Sfat many houses have blue window frames!  Practically, I have never heard of any instanc eof this and would be more likely to put it down to hysteria or the family needing to get used to their new house.  but since putting up mezuzot is something they should do anyway, hey if it makes them feel better at least they are also fulfilling a mitzvah!    Note:  A dybbbuk is found in some folklore and it is debateable if there is any such thing in actual sources.  even if it were, a dybbuk is the soul of a HUman, not a devil- you would be rid of it by helping it fulfill what its task is rather than any exorcism.  A dybbuk does not come for destructive purposes or to create havoc- it has a task that it needs to complete!  (Think of the movie sixth sense- the souls weren't there for negative purposes, but because they needed to do something before they could fulfill their purpose on earth).|`|AA11710118	Obviously your previous responder never heard of a 'dybbuk'.  You can google the term to learn about it.    The reason why your previous responder may not have known about dybbuks is that for a dybbuk to take control of a person, that person must be on a very high spiritual level, something which is extremely rare, if not non-existent in today's world.|`|peeC1ECfaa	yeah man they simply ignore it , because in Jesus' time even b4 his time they people lived like that & died being tormented by demons even King Saul died in that state without being cured! as for us thank God for Jesus !|`|AA11864826	Exorcisms are performed in Judaism. If you read the New Testament, you will find a couple of stories in Luke about the exorcisms allegedly performed by Jesus Christ.    The stories are a reflection of the Jewish belief in exorcism of demons. It was believed that when you know a demons name, you can call on the appropriate saint to come do battle with that particular demon. It is part of the Rabbinical Tradition dating about a thousand years before Christ.    -SD-|`|DTog0VZWaa	I've never actually heard of a Jewish family being in that situation so I don't know directly.    However, one can always pray -- and Orthodox family prays three times a day & puts up mezzuzah with the prayer to God in it, & brings in Shabbat.    Maybe after a while the spirits would feel the love & either take it in, heal & move on...or take off.  It is a noisy, busy household.  Judaism has no belief in devil, so whatever the energy that wouldn't be the assumption.    ============  Sadi  the NT stories aren't reflecting Jewish concepts, but rather Christian interpretations & misinterpretations of Jewish concepts.    Messanics mentioned by someone else - aren't Jews.  THAT'S why their views don't match Judaism.  They are evagelical Christians masquerading as Jews to steal our identity & force Christanity onto us.    =================  Prince  The trick is to start reading Issaiah from the beginning of the story, at least chapt 49.  It becomes obvious it's talking about Israel as the suffering servant.  Than add correction translations of the Hebrew (such as verbs in present tense instead of future) - & it's a prophecy of something happening at the time.  Not even that the child born to the already pregnant young maiden (not virgin) is special, just a symbol that all is well.    Your the 8th answerer so your comment to the 8the answer I dont' understand.  Those "few" changes are the significant ones.  For instance, there isn't the word pierce in the Hebrew.  The whole sin read is a Christain reading of it.  It's not in the context of this question so I won't put out more - but if you ask on YA - there are folks here who can give details. Doesn't mean Christianity is wrong on OT - but that it is mistaken to tell Judaism what we're mistaken on OUR books.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	I had to connect to you to see the question and answer. I think you've misunderstood the allonyoav's answer. He's very knowledgeable, so it's worth rereading. It's saying that we understand such things to be non-spiritual phenomena (i.e. epilepsy) and have since at least the 12th century.     That's not going to change when the phenomena occurs outside the body.    How would we deal with strange noises? Probably by getting the boiler tuned or moving the bowl from on top of the refrigerator.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It's all schizophrenic delusion, that's why Jews don't do exorcisms.

They were born a Pole, now they aren't.  Same thing.    If someone converts to Satanism from Christianity, they don't get to still claim to be a Christian.  Same thing.    Using terms like "personally know Yeshua" is insulting and dismissive of Judaism.  Christians know Jesus and G-d.  Jews know G-d.  Both are wonderful religions that CANNOT merge.

And the Pharisees of Judaism accused Jesus of healing people by the power of Beelzebub.  Jesus asked them by what power do they exorcise.  Jesus said that if people are healed by the finger of God, this is God. And that blasphemy of the Holy Spirit isn't forgiven today or tomorrow.    Jews of Judaism today are spiritually blind. This actually protects them somewhat from demonic spirits. Unless they practice the occult or something. Same as ever one else who is spiritually blind.|`|vZqYUZk1aa	In Judaism today there is Messianic the castaways, and 'mainstream' Judaism  in Mainstream the reform do not believe in spirits or hell either  in conservative the do to varying degrees  in orthodox the seem to most of all of any of them, and the head rabbi will say prayers, yet like Rabbi Schneerson who was going to be annointed the Messiah and had a stroke the day before that...there is many questions they cant solve in the Spirit relm.    The Messianic Jew on the other hand personally knows Jesus Yeshua in Hebrew and by his precious blood cast out deamon spirits.  I am such a Jew and have done it on more than one occassion including from deamon possed, but they have to want to get rid of the deamon, because in some form they had to invite it in, or into their home.    more on messianic; Help! Isaiah 53 Who is the prophecied one to be rejected and lays down his life as a lamb to forgive sins?  Who do you think this Scripture is talking about????    I am born Jewish and given a copy of our Tenach for my Bar Mitzvah  I AM TOLD I CAN BE AN ATHEIST AND STILL JEWISH, OR believe as some Orthodox Jewish do that Rabbi Schneerson was the Messiah, and still be Jewish, yet if I believe as my Yiddish Bubbie/grandma from Boston does that Yeshua/God is salvation/Yesus from the GReek=Jesus is the Messiah then I change and am not Jewish anymore= I change from having a Jewish mom to having a gentile mom?    Isaiah written 700 Bc/e before the coming of the gentiles Messiah Cristos/Christ from the GReek meaning the anointed one  Isaiah 42:1 says he will be a light to the gentiles.

He will show His arm unto us  He will be despised and rejected   He will lay down his life as a lamb, to make atonement for our sins  he will die with the wicked and be burried with the rich  He will see his seed and prosper (last verse of Isaiah chapter 53)    JEWISH ONCE SAID IT WAS THE MESSIAH  today in true form they mostly say it is Israel... when did Israel reject and despise itself, get marred more than any man, lay down its life innocent for its own sins, die with the wicked and get burried with the rich, see it's own seed spiritually and prosper after dying?    MUSLIMS say that Jesus is the Messiah, born of a virgin, lived sinless, and rose to heaven...that he didnt ever die, another took his place on the cross...making his mother crying at the cross...over the wrong person dilusional? and as she said "Behold my savior and my God." John's gospel....  MUSLIMS SAY that the Jewish people tampered and changed the bible (yet why would they PUT THIS IN ABOUT HIM DYING FOR THEIR SINS?..AND not remove it rather than put this in, as it is so obviously pointing to......would those who despise and reject add this? the one that Muslims say is the Messiah coming back to earth=clue it is not Mohamad)    ATHEISTS could you predict what will happen in 700 years... like this?    "Unto us a child is born a son is given, and he is mighty God, wonderful in counsel, the everlasting father and the prince of peace." Isaiah 9:6    Who WHO????

Additional Details  4 hours ago    MOSES SAID "Without the shedding of blood (blood sacrifice innocent for our guilt) there is no forgiveness of sins." Leviticus 17:11    some say Judaism accepted the Messiah, and those that didnt made a new religon, rejecting Moses and the Messiah and making their own rules for forgiveness of sins...prayers, alms and whatever     the reson for this was the completion and fulfiment of Jeremeiah 31:30 and following verses  "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, NOT LIKE THE ONE I MADE WITH MOSES, AND you shall be my people and I will be your God."    No loinger only the HIGH PRIEST once a year came before God to bring the blood sacrifice on Yom KIPPUR THE DAY OF ATONEMENT.    with the temple gone 70BCE, a new covenant in place, we have direct access in the new covenant.      or else  WHO IS ISAIAH 53 speaking of???  4 hours ago    ok   answerers 1-3 but why dont the Jewish, muslims and athiests see this too?    Who is Isaiah 53 talking about?  3 hours ago    8th answerer  wow how does israel die innocent for its own sins  Hakavay ediditon of the Jewish scripturues, published by the New York press, is almost word for word the same as the KJ version  only Zechariah 12:10 has a foot note that it is speakinf of Israel! "And we shall look upon him whom we have pierced and shall mourn as a mother for her only lost child."

Worse yet, when they ARE told, they block their ears and poke out their eyes (spiritually speaking), like the man who lived in a small village near a waterfall.  For some reason, he did NOT like rainbows, so whenever a double-rainbow would appear in the sky, he got angry when all the little kids came knocking on everybody's door to get them to come outside to watch.  So, one day, he decided to do something about it, once and for all.  He poked his eyes out!  Then, the next time one of the neighborhood children came to his door to tell him about the double rainbow in the sky, he said that rainbows don't exist!  Even when the kid insisted, he said that he can't see rainbows, therefore they don't exist!  That's what the atheist does in denying the existence of God and eternity, and many of them do, indeed, seem very happy in their ignorance.    So, yes - ignorance is, indeed, bliss.  (At least for the time being.  If the bridge is out, and you ignore the warning signs, you won't have any more doubts when your car is falling off the edge of the cliff!)|`|08H81poqaa	It is not in the ignoring or dismissing reality.  My own personal theory is to ignore the negative thinking going on within.  When one ignores the constant thinking there is a feeling of blissfulness.  Maybe another word to replace ignorance like "Mindlessness is bliss".  When we quit thinking so much we are suspended in a supernatural dimension.      I do not like the way some in our society are so dismissive.  This is like "sweeping it under the rug".   I will be in town today and more than likely a homeless person will approach me.  If I have a few extra bucks or food with me, then I will share.  I cannot dismiss this person!  I don't care what or who they are or what they have done.  I see this person as I see myself.  There is no difference except that I had food or money to offer without any strings attached.    Peace.  Amanda|`|yHfsHp6naa	To some people, yes.

It is written to not believe every thing you read or hear. We all filter data through our experience model and fit the data into it as best we can. If something does not fit, we may just reject it as not true. Whether it is true or not is irrelevant to us, it is our perception of reality (truth) that matters. Things told to up that are beyond our sense's perception are taken or rejected purely on our framework and our perception of the person providing the data as reliable or not. I used to believe in Santa Claus until my perception changed and I determined it was a story. To a three year old having lived through a couple of Christmas seasons, it would be difficult to convince there is not Santa Claus. By the age of twelve, most preteens have figured out Santa could not possibly visit over a billion houses in one night and haul all of the cargo (presents).     In the end our perception of reality changes over time. Hopefully it gets closer to the real truth. The more you learn, the more ignorant you may feel. I know now that there is so much more that I have yet to learn. Yes ignorance is bliss. Just when you think you know it all, something happens and you learn that you really know about a thimble of sand compared to all of the beaches on our planet. Be happy and do not worry about things you can not influence for now...more grains of sand (issues) are always coming down the road. By the time you die, you might just have a quart of sand...still leaving beaches full of truths you are ignorant of.

They are content to live in ignorance of the horrendous history of the atrocities and indecencies that litter their "holy" books...and STILL maintain that this is the 'inspired' word of their god.  To believe THAT, having actually read and studied any religious scripture is to be convinced that the gods of those scriptures are homicidal maniacs.

aO4iCwtoaa	It's not a matter of consequences.  Judaism doesn't have the concept of eternal damnation or going to Hell for your sins, and while we do believe that failure to observe the commandments can result in punishment, it's not a "if you do X, Y will happen" sort of thing.      Getting a tattoo is against Jewish law, plain and simple.  If you do, you are breaking one of the Torah laws, but nothing will "happen."  You can still be buried in a Jewish cemetary.  the mikvah lady won't tell anyone.  It's possible that if a Jewish man with a non-hidable tattoo becomes Orthodox (or an Orthodox man gets one, but that's a far less likely scenario), that he will not be called up to the Torah during services, as there is a belief that Jews who flagrantly flaunt nonobservance of the commandments are not entitled to the honor, but that's about it.  If you have no problem violating other commandments, such as not keeping the kosher laws, then getting a tattoo is not more of a problem.  And it is considered far worse to violate the sabbath.      The basic understanding is, G-d gave us these laws, and we promised to keep them, whether they make sense or not.  So choosing to break them could be seen as disobeying G-d, or disrespecting his laws.  Like all laws, a person can repent for the action and ask for forgiveness - every year gives us another opportunity for that.  So even though the ink may be permanent, the person can get past it if they are sincere.  Whether the transgression comes with consequences after death, there's only one way to find out :)|`|6ZRF1jW4aa	If the body is a temple, doesn't it deserve to be dressed up a bit?

Mark on the outside of the boxes what room they are to go into at the new place.  Sure saves lots of work and frantic searching later.  Do not under any circumstances allow anyone but the movers to load or pick up any box.  This will decrease the movers liability.    If your parents are "helping" make sure they know you don't want them handling the boxes or anything else.  When you arrive at the new place open those boxes and make sure they are intact.  Show the movers any damage that is done at the time it is delivered.  As for what can the parents do to help?  Have one of them stationed at the new place to "receive " when the van arrives.  Make sure they have a list of what is on your invoice and check it off as it comes in the house.  Use the other parent to run errands. This will be very useful and frees you up to supervise the move.  By all means feed the men on the van but if they were driving my life they would get sodas not beer.|`|AA10405438	Watch.

You want to have all the fun you can now but want also to be assured a place in heaven when you pass on.      My advice to you is that since you only go around once in life you need to enjoy that life as much as possible.  One thing is sure and that is if you heed all the taboos and warnings of christianity then you won't enjoy your life much.  Since god, religion, the heaven or hell concept, etc. is all a big fantasy anyway, then you should do all the things that are consistent with being a good citizen and not worry about the afterlife.  The bible is a book of fantasy and fairy tales.  People who follow it are destined for a sad life of deprivation for no reason.      When you die that's the end of everything.  You lose consciousness as the curtain of death descends upon you and your breathing ceases.  You have no reality after that.  No heaven, no hell and no angels blowing their golden trumpets as you walk through the gates.|`|AA10239241	Well, according to Jesus himself, there is an intermediary place where sins of blasphemy won't be forgiven -- either in this life or in the life to come.  If heaven is right after death, nothing needs forgiving.  If hell is next, there is no forgiveness.  so where is that place where sins can be forgiven -- that life to come, he spoke of?  One must be made comletely pure before entering heaven.  God's forgiveness isn't enough.  YOU are the one who has to decide to give up all of your weaknesses, habits, and tendency to sin.  God cannot and will not take away your free will. No, what you have not entirely and freely handed over in this life will be given opportunity to do so in the next life.  That being said, Purgatory is not a second chance.  All of those in Purgatory are filled with immense joy because they know that they will enter into heaven -- ultimately.
60a21d73367b6bc125257e3aedc3acc9aa	I use to go to church every Sunday and Wednesday and attended Catholic school. Once I became an adult and got married I started going to a Baptist church with my husband. This is what I've found over the years about churches.  The same people in school that brag about how much money their family has and you don't, go to church.  The same people that look down on you because you don't live in a nice big house like them, go to church.  That nasty person you had to deal with at work, goes to church  That person that goes around and gossips about others, goes to church.   The same mom and dad that wont let their kids play with others because their poor and don't live in as nice of an area as themselves, goes to church  The same people that sit at the bar Saturday night and drive home drunk putting your family at risk, goes to church    I see no reason to be near those people and give a church and pastor my money every Sunday to just make their church bigger and prettier. The pastor has no right driving such nice cars and wearing such expensive suits.    Just think if the church would put just as much money into the community and the homeless as they do trying to keep up with the "Jones" church down the road, this country and others wouldn't be where it is today.    Think about how much money is collected in just one service. Now add that up into 8 days out of the month with several services a day....that's alot of money. Does it really cost that much to keep the lights, water, heat, gas, and phone on? Their office staff maybe makes a combined income of 4000 month. Where does all that extra money go? Don't most people volunteer at a church? Yeah, think about it.    Say your prayers, be a good person, don't judge others on issues they can't control or the hand they've been delt, and give your weekly offering to a homeless family. You'll do more godly good that way.    God Bless!|`|PWankIUpaa	Hi Jasper    Greetings in the Holy and Precious Name above all others Jesus the Christ!        If I understand your question correctly you are concerned about denominational affiliations .    Jasper we are told By Jesus Himself to Forsake not the gathering together our selves together. I understand your reluctance but this was a command for our own good !         When we associate with other Christians we hold our selves Accountable to the Holy Bible more closely ! We also have our brothers and sisters to encourage and inspire us to deeper meanings and understandings! While I do not advocate any one domination over the other I find that Independent Baptist Churches offer the Greatest Freedom to investigate and Share Your own personal findings over most domination's!  I have seen the exact thing which you are suggesting and that is why I have left Orthodoxy, Catholicism , The organized , Lutheranism and Baptist which hold them selves hostage ot creations of Mankind!        Religion has NO PART in a relation Jesus the Messiah of the World ! This is What He created us for , A Relationship with Him and He Commanded us to Share the Gospel of Jesus  with any one we came in contact with. Like a Sower sewing Seeds we are to give the Gospel to everyone and let the Holy Spirit work the Soil and feed the seeds that we have sown in the Name of Jesus. These seeds of Witness and the Gospel land on the Hearts of men and if they fall on a heart which is not too heard and cold it will germinate groth and the Holy Spirit will be allowed to lead this person to a saving Grace Knowledge of Himself !        In those instanceses we are the Spiritual big Brothers to htat person and if they accept  our help we should be ready to deciple them in to a Full Relationship with now our Father God> This we do by Study and committment to God and we are Responcible for that Soul   as long as we are needed!         Church affliliations do NOT ,for the most part , Fulfill these needs of the New Christian which I have experienced and have seen others experience as well! We never know where our seeds will fall and who's heart will be receptive!         We can only committ to Jesus in Guidence for the Same Holy Spirit that lives in us is the Same Holy Spirit that lived in the Deciples!         For Help in Witnessing which NONE of us are exempt from go to the Book of Acts and start doing a Study   on Witnessing and How it should be done. I have taught this many times and each time I find myself more deeply Committed to this roll tha tGod has given All Christians!|`|1UokhVRXaa	2 Thessalonians 2:1-2  (1)  Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,  (2)  That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.

AA12275506	According to the trinity, God exists as three co-equal, co-eternal persons, right? How many persons do you see at John 10:30? Do you see three persons? Did Jesus say: "I and the Father AND the holy spirit are one? No.    BTW, what did Jesus mean when he said: "I and the Father are one? Jesus himself showed what he meant by his being "one" with the Father. At John 17:21, 22, he prayed to God that his disciples "may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, . . . that they may be one just as we are one." Was Jesus praying that all his disciples would become a single entity? No, obviously Jesus was praying that they would be united in thought and purpose, as he and God were.    Trinitarians will do their best to twist Scripture, but they will never succeed. NOWHERE in the Bible does it say that God exists as three persons. Instead, Jesus said at John 17:3 that his Father--a SINGLE PERSON--is "the only true God."|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Excellent question!!    I believe in 1 and 1 only.    God is ONE.

They said to him, "Of David."      43 He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him (The Messiah) Lord, saying,      44 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'      45 "If then David calls him Lord, how is he (The Messiah) his (David's) son?"

Nearly many number of times it is mentioned in bible GOD SENT JESUS ETC. sent word is used in bible number of times . why the trinitarian are not giving importance to the work SENT in the bible. In the jesus words also he said i am the way to God. Jesus is only the way not god. If all are one as trinity why Jesus sat by the side of God at last. Jesus prayed to God always in all situations , on the cross also. So many evidences are their in bible to show that jesus is not God and no trinity. Funny is that the holy spirit of God that means the power of God also created as one God in trinity. Holy spirit means the power of God. With that power only god did so many things. so, trinity is just hanging by only a few convenient verses by leaving bulk of verse showing jesus not God.|`|ifFYd0TGaa	i like it daisey.your either taking on the weak or really digging for truth.  easy answer though.when two humans have intercourse they are bonded by blood and become covenant.  god as  a covenant god decrees that this is solomn and should not be broken as his relationship with an individual.  i suppose you may want to ask a few on this toooooo.    no, they are still separate and answerable individually,however,as the head the husband will be the covering.|`|AA11564934	touche!!!|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	The Holy Trinity is joined spiritually.

F9RQjQsqaa	A bachelor is the type of degree you are getting usually a 4 year course eg. Bachelor - 4 years Bachelor of science or business, Masters - usually 6 years and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) - 8 or more years    A major and minor are the subjects you are taking such as a major in art with a minor in history say.    So when you go to school you can major in Asian studies with a minor in say Asian language (don't quote me on the actual courses of course) But when you are done your 4 years of school, you will have a Bachelors of Arts Degree in Asian studies.     Comprendez-vous?    As for if it's a good idea or not, that all depends on how bad you want to do that.
macZI2dzaa	The bombadier beetle is a favorite creature of creationists because of its ability to spray a noxious gas at would be attackers.  The beetle has two sealed chambers within it abdomen each containing a relatively non-toxic liquid.  The beetle can spray these two liquids simultaneously such that they mix a short distance from the beetle's body and create a toxic and hot gas/liquid mixture.  There is no way that such a process could come about by a slow step by step process over millions of years.  The fact that these beetles defend themselves in this way is irreducibly complex.  The evolutionary explanations and "step by step" theories are strictly general and do not deal with the incredible micro-biological changes that must occur in a particular order.    The idea of irreducible complexity can be simplified (an irony I know) by considering a mouse trap. If any of the parts of the mouse trap are removed the trap does not function at all.  Remember in evolution every tiny step must provide the critter with a greater likelihood of survival (based on the Darwinian tautology known as the survival of the fittest).|`|0564dc987b9546049f74f258eb7c1648aa	As usual, Mr. Cooke didn't mean anything because the statement isn't true.

Excellent link, Mr Pants, thanks|`|6d10d96d77b1df1496e4b66f2f0098bcaa	Here is the step by step process of bombadier beetle evolution      Quinones are produced by epidermal cells for tanning the cuticle. This exists commonly in arthropods. [Dettner, 1987]    Some of the quinones don't get used up, but sit on the epidermis, making the arthropod distasteful. (Quinones are used as defensive secretions in a variety of modern arthropods, from beetles to millipedes. [Eisner, 1970])    Small invaginations develop in the epidermis between sclerites (plates of cuticle). By wiggling, the insect can squeeze more quinones onto its surface when they're needed.    The invaginations deepen. Muscles are moved around slightly, allowing them to help expel the quinones from some of them. (Many ants have glands similar to this near the end of their abdomen. [Holldobler & Wilson, 1990, pp. 233-237])    A couple invaginations (now reservoirs) become so deep that the others are inconsequential by comparison. Those gradually revert to the original epidermis.    In various insects, different defensive chemicals besides quinones appear. (See Eisner, 1970, for a review.) This helps those insects defend against predators which have evolved resistance to quinones. One of the new defensive chemicals is hydroquinone.    Cells that secrete the hydroquinones develop in multiple layers over part of the reservoir, allowing more hydroquinones to be produced. Channels between cells allow hydroquinones from all layers to reach the reservior.    The channels become a duct, specialized for transporting the chemicals. The secretory cells withdraw from the reservoir surface, ultimately becoming a separate organ.   This stage -- secretory glands connected by ducts to reservoirs -- exists in many beetles. The particular configuration of glands and reservoirs that bombardier beetles have is common to the other beetles in their suborder. [Forsyth, 1970]    Muscles adapt which close off the reservior, thus preventing the chemicals from leaking out when they're not needed.    Hydrogen peroxide, which is a common by-product of cellular metabolism, becomes mixed with the hydroquinones. The two react slowly, so a mixture of quinones and hydroquinones get used for defense.    Cells secreting a small amount of catalases and peroxidases appear along the output passage of the reservoir, outside the valve which closes it off from the outside. These ensure that more quinones appear in the defensive secretions. Catalases exist in almost all cells, and peroxidases are also common in plants, animals, and bacteria, so those chemicals needn't be developed from scratch but merely concentrated in one location.    More catalases and peroxidases are produced, so the discharge is warmer and is expelled faster by the oxygen generated by the reaction. The beetle Metrius contractus provides an example of a bombardier beetle which produces a foamy discharge, not jets, from its reaction chambers. The bubbling of the foam produces a fine mist. [Eisner et al., 2000]    The walls of that part of the output passage become firmer, allowing them to better withstand the heat and pressure generated by the reaction.    Still more catalases and peroxidases are produced, and the walls toughen and shape into a reaction chamber. Gradually they become the mechanism of today's bombardier beetles.    The tip of the beetle's abdomen becomes somewhat elongated and more flexible, allowing the beetle to aim its discharge in various directions.|`|AA11232725	I'm guessing he wrote that before he had heard the evolutionist rebuttal. To me it seems pretty fantastic that chance mutations could be responsible for the design of a beetle that mixes chemicals inside it's body to send out an explosive charge of hot gases like a miniature natural "flame thrower" but the evolutionists point out that the chemicals are found in other similar beetles and serve a different purpose.    Therefore, they claim that the magic wand of mutations having been waved over a primitive beetle for millions of years finally produced a beetle that could do what the Bombardier Beetle does because natural selection kept on canceling out all of the mistakes along the way and so any "appearance of design" is just a figment of our imagination.    In other words "There is no creator God - chance and time did it with natural selection overseeing the process".    Talk about needing to have faith to believe something about the past....sheesh.

All He does is decide when their appeals have run out and pronounces judgment.    The story of Ananias and Sapphira demonstrates how God will make an example of people who don't respect Him when He is calling out a people to represent Him here on earth. There is a similar account when God was first calling the Israelites out of Egypt.    Leviticus 10:1  Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to his command.  2  So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.  3  Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD spoke of when he said: "'Among those who approach me I will show myself holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.'" Aaron remained silent.    God makes a harsh example of people at the beginning so that He doesn't have to deal with a bunch of people thinking that they can sin against Him and it's no big deal.    Acts 5:9  Peter said to her, "How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also."  10  At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.  11  Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.

Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you.  ~Deuteronomy 18:10-12 (NIV)        4 The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa. 5 When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. 6 He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. 7 Saul then said to his attendants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her."         "There is one in Endor," they said.      8 So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. "Consult a spirit for me," he said, "and bring up for me the one I name."      9 But the woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?"      10 Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As surely as the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this."      11 Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?"         "Bring up Samuel," he said.      12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"      13 The king said to her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?"         The woman said, "I see a spirit [a] coming up out of the ground."      14 "What does he look like?" he asked.         "An old man wearing a robe is coming up," she said.         Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.      15 Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?"         "I am in great distress," Saul said. "The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do."      16 Samuel said, "Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy? 17 The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighborsto David. 18 Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today. 19 The LORD will hand over both Israel and you to the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines."      20 Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel's words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and night.      21 When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, "Look, your maidservant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. 22 Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way."      23 He refused and said, "I will not eat."         But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch.      24 The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. 25 Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.    ~1 Samuel 28 (NIV)|`|AA11448061	The Bible mentions spirits but not ghosts, other then the Holy Ghost.     I truly believe that ghosts are nothing but demons.  The Bible says that when you die your soul goes to either Heaven or Hell, it doesn't linger here on Earth to haunt things.  And I for sure wouldn't talk to a ghosts, it would be like opening a door you never wanted to open like a Ouija board.  That's how people get possessed is talking to "spirits" and playing with Ouija boards.|`|hj76FSKdaa	Well, Jesus said in Luke 24:39 that he was not a ghost.  He asked his disciples to touch him to be sure that he was not.  In Matthew 14:26, the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water and yelled out that it was a ghost.  Jesus told them not to be afraid because he actually was not a ghost.  I wonder why Jesus did not tell the disciples in both cases that there is no such thing as ghosts.  Because, personally, I dont think the Bible really says that dead spirits are wandering around the earth.

However, if you have a nagging feeling that perhaps you should go to confession, it's not a bad idea.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	No, only if you have done something extremely wrong.    I mean, don't get me wrong, I would LOVE if we could all go to confession before communion, but it would just be too difficult. There would be a 4 hour waiting line before mass.

Many Catholics today do not even know what serious sin(mortal) is by virtue of indifference, to casually receive the body and blood of Christ in such a condition is very wrong and inexcusable.  Another sad fact of modern life is the short lines for confession in most churches and the long lines for communion,this should tell us something is not right.

Even little sins -- venial ones -- can come between me and my Beloved so I want to not have these interfere with our relationship.

So sometimes I do feel like my values and morals are in park for a little bit.......... because I can't voice them but that doesn't change them for me.    People have to realize just because it's their morals and their values- it doesn't mean that it's 100% rRight and the other person is 100% wrong... we come from different back grounds and religions.  I think when you say moral- people assume it's an extreme NO like we are going to have an orgy... but it can be small things too like calling your parents by their first name.  Some parents allow it- so it's not wrong in their family- but I am 31 and if I called my mom by her first name- I would get smacked with a shoe!  LOL
4xtJjPzyaa	It's cause the world is so diverse i think.  Some people are essentially good with a little bad.  Others essentially bad with a little good.   People have different values and morals that conflict with others  so they feel threatened or annoyed that others don't agree or abide with theirs.   Some people are unhappy with life and direct this anger to others  to make them feel they have power and influence.   I think the way to go about it is just not suffer at their hands  If it's viewed as a "game" don't let them "win"   just condition yourself to not let them get in your way  to not let their comments or actions effect you  because if there is a form of karma you will end up ontop :)|`|c637ab5fb2b9b7fc33da445cd7cd0d19aa	Stressed people who want to pass the buck to others.|`|OwHQrtEkaa	The world is full of envy.

Religion is viewed as one of the largest cause of troubles. Religion is being turned against in the school curriculum. In some western nations even religious symbols worn in schools are being banned. In western societies people want religious meddling and influence out of the politics of the state. Religion and warfare has been hand in hand. Church leaders have promoted their congregations to fight on behalf of the nations, even against each other.    The execution of Babylon the Great will not simply be the expression of political enmity toward religious arrogance and interference. The political rulers will be Gods involuntary tools for the destruction of false worship worldwide.

Not everyone who says they are a Christian is a Christian. In fact, the enemies of Jesus Christ are often found in church. Think about it. If you wanted to take down an organization, how would you do it? I would infiltrate it and take it down internally, destroying it's credibility in the process. Hopefully I would be able to attach my evil work to as many people as possible, preferably as high up the chain of command as possible. Look at the freemasons and their infiltration of the church. That was their specific goal, to infiltrate, according to their own documents, "especially southern baptist churches". That's not to say that the Southern Baptist churches are bad. I am a member of one myself. On the contrary, it shows me that the enemy considered the Southern Baptists dangerous and therefore important in infiltrating. Too many of us have let our guard down and allowed them to achieve influential positions of authority in our churches.       Anyway, that's why it's such an abomination that all of these war mongering presidents and politicians who like to start aggresive wars and commit all kinds of evil always like to remind everybody that they're a "Christian". You really think Dubya Bush is a Christian?? He says he is. What he "won't" tell you is: he's a member of Skull and Bones, a German-based secret society, with a bloody record of all kinds of secret occult practices and rituals. How can a man who follows Christ be involved in something like that?? I'll tell you how. It's because he is an enemy of Jesus and he's successfully hoodwinked a lot of good Christian people into endorsing or defending the evil that he's done, and in the process, the end goal is met: which is, to destroy the credibility of the teachings of, and more specifically, the followers of, Jesus Christ. Duyba Bushs father was Skull and Bones, his grandfather, Prescott Bush was Skull and Bones (and was indicted under the trading with the enemies act during WW2 for being a financial frontman for Adolph Hitler) and Herbert Walker, George Bush's grandfater on his mother's side was also Skull and Bones. How many good Christian American people have been deceived into believing that the Bushes were just a family of good ol' boys from Texas who were just up there in Washington doing the best they could to fight evil?? And by the way, if you think voting democrat would have helped: John Kerry is also Skull and Bones. They own both parties.  God will deal with these evil-doers the same way he dealt with the Pharisees of the time of His earthly ministry.  Seek Jesus with everything you have and be careful that you not be deceived.

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so my religion, gives life a reason and a goal, and peomises me of a better eternal one when I die. What does atheism promise you after death?  how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|1MGXHYq9aa	Sometimes I feel like I'm pretending I'm believing in a religion.     Because I'm a lousy Christian as far as Christians go, but I like what I hear what Jesus said.     But I don't like churches or the way some Christians act.     And I don't like to judge others, so I get along with atheists or everyone else I know.     So when I make religious statements on this forum, I believe what I said, but at the same time I feel like a fraud.    And sometimes I like throwing in controversial statements towards both Christians and atheists just to see what sh_t is stirred.

Man creates machines and we created the concept of God inside our minds many, many years ago.    True, big bang theory, expansion of the universe, and evolution are only theories.  They attempt to explain how our universe and life has developed through the millions of years.  They are not perfect nor are they necessarily completely true.  They are our best guesses at our current state of knowledge.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Nothing times zero exploded and became everything.    If we evolved, what came first... the heart or the blood... you cant have one without the other. How about your brain or your skull? which was first.  If you dont have a brain, there is no need for a skull. If you dont have a skull your brain wouldnt be protected and you wouldnt live long enough to evolve a skull.    When we crawled out of the muck, were we male or female?

It is our job to make sure others don't fk with it:           "The United States in is no sense founded upon the Christian religion." George Washington    "Revealed religion has no weight with me." Benjamin Franklin    "I do not find in Christianity one redeeming feature." Thomas Jefferson    "This could be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in it." John Adams    "I disbelieve all holy men and holy books." Thomas Paine    "Religions are all alike, founded upon fables and myths." Thomas Jefferson    "In no instance have churches been the guardians of the liberties of the people." James Madison    "The Christian god is cruel, vindictive, capricious, and unjust." Thomas Jefferson    "What has been Christianity's fruits? Superstition, bigotry, and persecution." James Madison    Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bibleis filled, it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize  mankind." Thomas Paine      "The Bible is not my book, nor Christianity my profession."  Abraham Lincoln    If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise  of fighting a foreign enemy.  --James Madison    "I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do because I notice it always coincides with their own desires." Susan B. Anthony      "If we look back into history for the character of the present sects in Christianity, we shall find few that have not in their turns been persecutors, and complainers ofpersecution. The primitive Christians thought persecution extremely wrong in the Pagans, but practiced it on one another. The first Protestants of the Church of England blamed persecution in the Romish Church, but practiced it upon the Puritans. They found it wrong in Bishops, but fell into the practice themselves both here (England) and in New England."  -Franklin    "I looked around for God's judgments, but saw no signs of them."  -Franklin    "Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not advanced an inch    towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over the earth."  -Jefferson    "Experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of religion, have had a contrary operation. During almost fifteen    centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What has been its fruits? More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution."  -Madison    "As I understand the Christian religion, it was, and is, a revelation. But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends, have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed?"  -Adams|`|jW0VqZcOaa	Just like he made your breakfast this morning...      ... which is to say, NO.|`|1MGXHYq9aa	He did create the land mass, but the nation was created by the people.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	No, absolutely not.

I don't know what Australian English is.|`|F9RQjQsqaa	What do you mean by 'levels'? Like accents or dialects?     There is about 20 different accents in Britain alone  In Canada we have regular that is from about Vancouver to Toronto, french canadian, maritime, newfoundland dialect and then the way cowboys in Alberta talk. There's also western states which is similar to canadian, southern states which is similar to albertan cowboy and new jersey and new york and boston and fisherman. There are probably several in Australia.    Or there is old english derived from the germanic languages of the Angles of Denmark and the Saxons of Germany when they invaded in the 5th century. Middle english which was spoken between the conquest of the normans in the 11th century and about 1500. Early modern english of which words originated from latin, french and middle english. And eventually modern english which we speak today.    BTW Canadian english is much different than british, we may spell some of the words the same, but we all together speak differently and have a different vocab.

143bm6cnaa	I carry a gun because a cop is to heavy to carry.    The original purpose of the 2nd amendment was to give citizens the right to arm and protect themselves against a tyrannical government.    Our current issue is one of personal protection against criminals who wish to do us bodily harm.    There are plenty of gun laws that could be more strictly enforced.      Also, if we have the right to carry arms, then the death penalty is a good deterrent to gun related murders.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	No, and in my country you have to be very, very persuasive to let the authorities let you own one. I don't know why you'd want to, either, unless you genuinely do like hunting, or what have you.    I used to think that those who opposed gun control were a bit mental. But now I'm thinking, perhaps people should have the freedom to own a gun, but I'd be very specific about carrying it about and using it. I also think, and I don't know if one must in America, you should pass some kind of gun safety/psychological test before they let you have one.    So, in answer to your questions, no. And yes I support the second amendment right, but with some reservations.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	yes and yes!!!!|`|kJ4g1vujaa	No, and we don't have or want that right.    BTW  The second amendment was about carrying the long land pattern musket (the Brown Bess) for the purposes of forming a militia.    Not for people to keep automatic weapons under their bed.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	yes and yes.|`|AA10236979	Absolutely!|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	yes i own several, and i dont want to debate on what the second amendment means or can be interpreted as meaning, I dont want the nra lobbying for plastic guns and copkiller bullets and no background checks, they should  instead make the system of laws we already have worakable and enforceable so criminals and crazies stop giving resonsible gun owners who just like the sound and flames and shooting things a bad name.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	yes and yes

BJugETlOaa	My husband was in Prison for two years and I wrote to him almost every day, people in prison love letters, they don't get much outside contact and they will be better people in the long run if they have a connection to the outside world. This is something that irritates me about prison. If you mess up the first thing they take away is visits with family and statistics show that people who have family or friends outside of prison and stay in touch with them do better once they get out. So yes it is a good idea. You will be giving someone a chance to do better, you will be making a friend. Not everyone in prison is there for a horrid act. Someone hit my husband and my husband who was alot smaller than the guy fought back and won, so he went to jail.|`|NMFBOTgiaa	Funny for you to ask this because just lastnight I was watching a show about becoming Pen Pals with a prisioner and how it can do good for them.

I, myself, am thinking about becoming a pen pal..and if you do plz get a P.O box first! :)|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I am not, but I agree, that would be interesting.

It just doesn't sound like a good idea to me...People go to prison for a lot of reasons...none of them good.
T8ksKCWCaa	Here in the west, her behaviour would still make many men uneasy. If you were to become more committed, would this continue? One of the vows of marriage is to ' forsake all others' meaning you become her priority. If this is not how she behaves, then maybe she is not as serious about you as you are about her.   Also, just because a behaviour is common in the west, it does not mean people like or approve of the behaviour. Promiscuity is common, but so is divorce.  If this were me, I would find someone with more common interests.|`|DWFMM23Caa	well I wouldn't like it if it was my boyfriend doing that with another girl.  I would also become suspicious.but then again they may just be friends and then there is no harm in that either,.|`|jTFdG8xqaa	Have you talked to her about it? Seriously, sit down tell her how you feel. I know very little about korea itself, though one of my COMP SCI teacher's is Korean and a genius, and i had a neighbor...and a few friends...whatever...anyway you need to tell her that it is not because you don't trust her it's obvious you do, but that this late night stuff is scary to you because you are not used to it. Try to compromise. See if she can cut down on the late night calls and late night visits, and you can back off just a little on the making her feel uncomfortable about seeing her friends. It is partially generational. When you are younger you are much more apt to want to see your friends...why don't you go out with her get to know her friends? Your older but that doesn't mean you have to be boring. Good Luck
EzrdyxAiaa	i guess to some one of the korean culture it might be hard to understand - i have a lady friend i have known for about 15 years -- there is nothing i would not do for this lady -- we take vacations together and do a lot of things -- by the way she lives 400 miles away - so we do not see each other as much as we would like to!!! there is no sex involved -- just great friends -- in fact we have certain traits that we should fall in love it would not work and in six months we would hate each other!!!
8gveZWbHaa	I think he's a fraud    Suggestible people may feel an alleviation of their symptoms in the circumstances due to adrenalin, auto-suggestion and the placebo effect, but I wonder if any proper medical or scientific studies have been done on the ones he "healed".  I doubt it.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Benny Hinn is a religious freak who has a sure cure for your fat wallet. It's called a transfusion - he suckers you into transfusing your money from your wallet to his!|`|AA11232725	2 Peter 2:1  But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.  2  Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.  3  In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.     How could he do that? Do you think he is very powerful?    It's either crowd control mind tricks or something even worse.

He will be the first to tell you that he is not the healer, rather Jesus is. As for people "fainting" as you put it, it has to do with human beings becoming confronted with the power and presence of the living God....|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Of Whom do you speak, Benny Comb-over?!    *sighs* I am not a fan.     While i do not dispute the power of the Holy Spirit to defy gravity and the blood pressure of the human body, i do not believe that those falling "under the anointing" or that are "slain in the spirit" actually are. I think it is mostly a matter of religious fanaticism and the persons desires overtaking their reasoning abilities.    Technically, Benny has no power in and of himself. Neither does any man, evangelist, pastor OR layperson. Hypothetically, it is the "anointing" or presence of the Holy Spirit himself that performs the miracles and the erm ...  "slaying."    I was raised in an Assemblies of God church, so the anointing of God and the gifts of the Spirit are almost as natural to me as breathing. And i most certainly do not doubt the power of God made manifest, but in and of himself alone not upon the commands or wills of men. (IF God was unable to perform any act, even those that defy nature then he could not logically be "God.")   That being said, i have just about seen it all. MOST of those people are either faking it because they want to "experience" the power of God and feel that they are not, OR they are exhibiting a physical reaction to a fanatical psychological desire. I would say that only about 5% actually have a valid experience along those lines. It IS possible and it does happen; but i think on a lesser level than is advertised on TV.    Anyways, I am not a fan of the comb-over. I do not like his "ministry" and i do not like his teachings. Though some are Biblical, i feel that he has gone the way of the TBN televangelist that preaches the false doctrine of the "prosperity theology" and i disagree vehemently.  Neither the gifts of the spirit and "miracles" nor the gospel of Christ is up for sale.     I think that, either willfully or unintentionally, Benny Hinn plays upon the insecurities of people and their spiritual desires using the Word of God to propagate his own agenda. I feel that he makes an exhibition of the power of God when it is not even present thusly making a mockery of the cross of Calvary and the Gospel of Christ.   The Holy Spirit cannot be bought, and man cannot bribe God to do for them with an offering.    I think that when Benny Hinn first started out he was somewhat credible but, as i stated with the Joel Olsteen answer, either time or TBN has turned him into a false teacher and he is reduced to a really expensive infomercial at the cost of the salvation of others.    I have mixed emotions of both contempt and embarrassment concerning him. NOT all Christians, even A/G Christians are that fanatical and fruit-loopy; neither do we "preach the word" for financial gain thusly ruining the spiritual and emotional lives of those who hear our message while making a total mockery of Christ by our actions.    I cannot judge his sincerity, but i can judge his style of preaching, and that my friend, i feel is disgraceful.   I think he should spend more time reading the Word (Bible) instead of asking for money to preach things contrary to it.    Also, i say IF you like him ... then let neither myself or no one else's opinion stop you from watching his program or listening to his message; BUT if you do the later, just watch your doctrine closely so that you are not led astray by illusionary tricks or spiritual manipulations for your checkbook. (1 Tim 4:16; 2 Peter 2:1-3; Matthew 24:23-24; Mark 13:20-23).     The wise can learn even from Benny Hinn, gleaning that which is good from that which is evil, but the truly wise would not be influenced by him at all.    xoxo  ?|`|WQvqLnnhaa	NOPE...

Going further back in history you will find the tradition of traveling snake oil salesmen who not only made a lot of money selling junk but also influenced the camp meeting tradition of going from town to town with circus size tents.

Isn't that what really matters?  Of course even correct answers get rejected.  You see it is not that something is wrong, it is more that something is popular.  In some categories, there is an established cliche.  Which guaranties only certain answers will be selected.    You see Yahoo Answer is no different that Idol or Dancing with the Stars.

nHizaTiDaa	I don't know if any "contrived" sort of witnessing works anyway.    Our very lives are to be our witness- if anyone notices that there is a difference in us- that we were kind to them- that our families are loving,  etc- we are to just give Christ the credit for it.       Tell folks- well,  Jesus loves you and so do I.   And be kind.     That is the best witnessing. The only true witnessing really.  Christians should be ever ready to be kind to someone, to lend a hand, and to know how to rightly divide the Scriptures so as to answer a person's questions if they ask about it.    I'm not even a fan at all of emotional altar calls, or pressing people into that "prayer of salvation", urging them to "ask Jesus into your heart"... I've heard people be told- Now, if you said that prayer and REALLY meant it.... you now have to keep your commitment to Jesus"  ... :??????  I say.    It's NOT how I biblical know what commitment to Christ means- it doesn't mean us making promises, and striving to keep them.  Oh man, we ALWAYS fail, don't we?    Rather, Biblical commitment to Christ means- totally surrendering OUR efforts and utterly putting yourself in God's hands for safekeeping.... it is God who keeps us, not us who strives to keep promises!      If all people do is have a little emotional moment and want to reform themselves on their own efforts- they will fail and then blame God for it. And be told- You just didn't keep your commitment.      This is horrible to me.    When God takes a person and transforms him- this is not man reforming himself, it is of God and it works.
AA10051908	The trinity is pagan.    All your scriptures that supposedly back up the trinity belief fall short. Most of your scriptures only consist of two beings? Almighty God and the Son of God. As a matter of fact, in 325 CE when the trinity doctrine was adopted into Christianity, they only had those two pieces.    Do some research on the trinity and you will see how the false religions influenced modern Christianity, and why the king ordered all the bishops to indoctrinate the trinity.|`|sVyH0jTiaa	Jesus trying to explain how to pray to Jehovah and do the right thing but Jesus is not God. Jesus is Son of God. Actually he was talking to his Father 'Jehovah God'|`|5pB2QAPUaa	Jesus is the King of God's Kingdom. It is his Father, Jehovah, who installed him as king in the heavens. Many here will say no, and comment on the trinity, but what the Bible says should be our guide.    1 Corinthians 15:24-28 "Next, the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power. For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet. As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing. For God subjected all things under his feet. But when he says that all things have been subjected, it is evident that it is with the exception of the one who subjected all things to him.  But when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone."     So, Jesus gives up his position as king when he hands the kingdom over to his Father- Jehovah. There is no 'godhead'. They are separate, holy, powerful spirit beings, but united in purpose.|`|AA11124121	the Kingdom that's coming.    He was not God in the Flesh.

They said to him, "Of David."      43 He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him (The Messiah) Lord, saying,      44 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, Until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'      45 "If then David calls him Lord, how is he (The Messiah) his (David's) son?"

Philippians 2:5,6.    Being the son of God, the authority Jesus has was given to him came from  Jehovah.

I know he refers to God as father, but this was very common in that time and place, and even today, God and gods are referred to as "Father".    Remember, many call themselves Children of God.  Why?  Why did it mean something else when Jesus said it?|`|hVVALFAPaa	The Trinity is three "people" in One:  God, the Father  God, the Son  God, the Holy Spirit.  They are three separate entities yet are still all One    That is hard for us simple humans to wrap our minds around but, hey, God is God, and can do anything! If He can create the universe, He can be three different Bodies.    Over the course of our lives, we see God in different ways and need different things from Him. I think He gave us the Trinity in order to better meet our spiritual needs.     Sometimes we need a disciplinarian, a stern parental-type figure to keep us on the straight and narrow. That is God, the Father.    Sometimes we need and older brother figure, a counselor, a friend, someone who has been there, done that. That is Jesus, the Son.    Sometimes we need the wonder and awe, the greater power, the 'magic', the miracles. That is the Holy Spirit.|`|gASz3hDWaa	He taught for his followers to pray for the kingdom of his Father, Jehovah God.    Hallowed be your name.... His name, Jehovah.

Matthew 4:10   Jesus said to him: Go away, Satan! For it is written, It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.    There is no God the Son or God the Holy Spirit ever written in the Bible. The tradition of the trinity is only found in the written religious creeds devised by men.

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	No, what is happening in the USA , truly brings the meaning to the saying. Feeding the hogs and keeping them fat , while slaughtering the pig's.     All of us overseas have been trying to telling you in the states, over the last eight years. That this was going to happen, as usual none of you never listened. Just remained on bragging thinking you all knew everything.    It's too late now to start blaming others when it's all your guy's own faults. That little Johnny and Becky America decided to join the armed services when they left school to go shoot hajji's.    Rather than joining the workforce and learning a skilled trade or taking on a apprenticeship in a skilled work industry. Or taking a job working in the factories which manufactured made in the USA exports, was far below them. Than joining the armed services to be a patriot American in Bush's wars of terror, who now all live week to week on a low pay check or on the street with other veterans.     Bush knew this was causing the factories to close down and start moving overseas where the trained skilled workers and young workers leaving school willing to work in the factories were.     Bush agreed by adding a tax on US business and company's, to allow US businesses and company's to advertise overseas to employ highly skilled overseas workers, to start apprentice train young Americans.     Due to his wars of terror, Americans bias opinionated religious and xenophobic attitudes, of foreigners taking there job's. US Puritanism,  bad education system, low paid wages, poor work conditions, high medical expenses, work place gender pay discrimination and outdated employment laws and discrimination.     The middle finger was shown to Americans, by the world, Causing the US media to create a propaganda story the world dislikes Americans, rather than telling the American public the truth. So more little Johnny and Becky's leaving school would join the armed services. To keep Americans in the dark of the recession by keeping unemployment figures down.    The US dollar drop and high gas prices and tax Bush placed on all US business and company's, and American religious and xenophobic attitudes. Started the snowball for many businesses and company's started to sack staff as they went under from high manufacturing and production costs and no profit for the shareholders.    From this, all "Made In the USA" company's and businesses  closed their doors and moved overseas to stay in business. Now nothing is made in the USA to export or keep the older and minimum wage earning Americans in jobs, and teach young Americans skills leaving school, to bring money to the US economy by manufacturing and selling exports.     Sorry mate, the truth is there currently are no young skilled workers in the USA and there's been no young workers trained for the last eight years to work in the manufacturing factories, Also no sales competition or profit can be made due to the high production costs manufacturing in the USA.    There are only hundreds of  thousands of returned totally unskilled and non apprenticed ex armed service personnel 20 year olds returned from shooting and torturing innocent people they call the hajji's.     Only with minimum wage hamburger flipper McDonald's high school job experience. Who are all too old to be apprenticed, all buying imported goods like all Americans.    Add the US economic depression to this, it's going to take many years, to just restart US industries to employ, train and apprentice skill young Americans leaving school to re start manufacturing and producing "Made in the USA" exports again.       Give it another few years, you will personally feel the effects of US patriotism. When you need a plumber or electrician, or need your fridge, washing machine or TV fixed, when the baby boomers are retired.     Discovering there aren't any qualified gold licensed skilled trade persons in the USA. Also you can't claim a cent from your  insurance if hiring an unskilled trades person who does a duct tape, stapler and glue, dodgy band aid repair.     No matter how many letters you write, it's going to take years to skill train Americans, before we all seeing US products with "Made in the USA" stamped on the label.|`|mggll8dRaa	Many families might have to start living within their means, and give-up Starbucks, Gyms and Huge Houses & Vehicles, and live according to their current position....!!

Jesus was tolerant?     Mat 23:14   Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.   Mat 23:15  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.   Mat 23:16  Woe unto you, [ye] blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!    Individualism?   Jhn 15:5    I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.    anti-war? Mat 24:6   And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all [these things] must come to pass, but the end is not yet.    You got one right. Jesus was anti elitism.

In terms of the US political system, the religious right has become very involved & influential and does not IMO live by the ideals of Jesus.  How many actually believe Jesus would support a war on terror, or war itself as a means to resolve conflict?  Sure you can throw some OT scripture out there to justify war but that wasn't the NT message.  Jesus forgave the men who killed him and would not have supported capital punishment as many from the RR do.|`|81SiImlSaa	You're quite right, Jesus was not a political figure but many, including the Pharisees and Romans of the day, use him as a political football.  Many, not all, Americans are so programmed with this idea of Christ being this omnipotent being who, if you don't believe in Him or follow the laws of His father, dooms you to hell in a hand basket.  This of course goes completely against what He had to say but in the end, it's all about FEAR....and as we all know, fear can be a powerful tool for manipulation, and we are talking politicians after all aren't we.|`|5qjxyb0jaa	Because they have no understanding of the bible.  Jesus warns his people will not be involved with this world (which would include the political world)  John 17:16  16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.  John 18:36  36Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place."   Christians are warned about who is in charge of this world .  1 John 5:19  19We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.  Those that get involve with politics or bring Jesus into it prove where their friendship lies , not with God but Satan  James 4:4   4 You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.

Did you have a debate with yourself and decide to be straight?  How silly.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	No, it's not a choice, and we're not born that way|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Absolutely.  There is no "gay" gene.  If everyone was homosexual how would genes get passed on?  You cant deny the biology.  That's why it is beyond biology.  Pretty simple. It is choice.  There is NO science that supports homosexual behavior as anything other that a learned behavior.  After all, heterosexuals become homosexual, then homosexuals become heterosexual.  Then there are bisexual people.  Are you gonna propose a biological reason for being bi?    Just used good sound logic and rational.  Live your life as you please.  Do not interfere in other peoples life and never attempt to force someone to live as you live.      What does hate have to do with it?|`|N73oZyY8aa	No, it isn't always. I think some bi people can choose one gender over another and be happy about it.|`|tc8nbxmyaa	does anyone choose to be straight?|`|AA10329269	I never chose to be heterosexual, I was just born that way.|`|64eba52b7a7dcdb30b1e7b1223d7eb33aa	the mind does not understand how it arrives at a conclusion......it just does.....you just have to figure out how it does.......sure...genes can give you the propensity to be a certain way....but its only a propensity....its not a fact.....like murders are'nt born murders....they become murders......|`|AA11883252	I think it's the coming out part that is a choice but a person doesn't choose to feel homosexual or heterosexual.

I saw a friend of mine suffer and even consider suicide an option all b/c they didn't want to be gay.  He has not accepted his homosexuality, and so has his close friends and family.  He is very happy now.  A person's sexuality is predestined; it's like left handedness.  There's nothing that you can do to prevent it, or change it.  It's not wrong.  It's just different.  People are afraid of things they don't understand.|`|XjLvbfTZaa	It's different far all of us.  There are those who chose and those of us, like me, who were born this way.

Because that is most definitely not the case. It is a slow realisation process, one that can take years, and is frequently not realised completely.    For me, it was not a choice. It is who I am.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Born that way.  You are who you are and that's the way it's meant to be.  I never chose to be straight - I just am.  No different for you.|`|PnJYGIneaa	Yes it's your choice if you want to be gay.  I don't mind much if a person is gay, if your happy than i'm happy.  Your mind thinks thinks differantly and you start to have feelings for the same gender.|`|vQeKxmZyaa	I think many chose to be gay but I also believe that most homosexuals have no choice.  But I also see that as a birth defect seeing as how the proper and natural order for the species of homosapien is to have male and female together.  That being said I don't begrudge them for their lifestyle.  It's a sickness with no cure.  God cannot "straighten" them no more than he can cure cancer.  So long as they're not interrupting others' lives I say live and let live.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	I have nothing against homosexual people.  One of my closest friends is a lesbian.  I don't think that they should be bigoted and isolated the way they are, but I do think that homosexuality is a choice.    We studied this in my psychology class.  I am a psychology major, so I find this theory interesting.  I'll try and explain it without writing a novel.    When you are born, even though you are developed in your appropriate gender, you are not thinking about sexual desires and sexual attraction.  You may (as you grow up) start to think someone is cute or have crushes on people, but you really don't develop strong sexual attraction or the desire to want to have sex until you go through puberty, which is on average around 12 years old.    That is 12 years of influence that you are subconsciously or consciously getting on your mind.  And your mind is the most susceptible and the most moldable for the first 12 years of your life.    For example, if you grow up in a troubled home, your parents are divorced, you suffer through domestic abuse, or something along those lines, you are going to have a different perspective of the male or female race.  If your father beat your mother, you are not going to subconsciously respect men.  If your mother cheated on your father, you are subconsciously not going to respect women.    Even though this does not happen in EVERY SINGLE case.  It happens in a lot.  A GREAT MAJORITY of homosexual people come from troubled homes that have dealt with divorce, infidelity, alcoholism, drugs, unwanted pregnancy, and abuse.    So if for 12 years, your view of women is skewed and when you finally start getting a sex drive, you are attracted to men, it would have to do with the way you were raised and what subconsciously influenced you when you were younger.    Thus, I don't think it is a choice, but I don't think you are born that way.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	i don't think there's a choice, it's just the way you look at the the different genders. the problem is many people don't understand that.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Who cares what 'others' think...we are what we are...and God made us that way.  We're happy with it...though I'm sorry 'others' aren't (but, all in all...it's 'their' problem...not ours)...  Learn to be who and what you are and be thankful you weren't born with 'hatred' in your nature...|`|dC7nBu53aa	No we were born that way|`|eC5QIpnbaa	toally a choice, ask any gay whether they'd take a cure if there was one and they'll tell you NO!  I chose to stop being a homosexual years ago and support the exgay movement now because i am sick of all the propaganda that says you are " born that way" its hogwash!!!|`|AA10907244	Born that way.|`|EDwlTWLwaa	sometimes  not always|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	sorry u cant change it!|`|ter6FVoBaa	no you're born like it  not a choice  at all!|`|q0q79Inyaa	no one is born gay or lesbian but they make the world a better place as they are happy and unique|`|2ac10106c0b1d6c0f702c4d23002e3b7aa	yea you can be whatever you want to be. some ppl hate to be gay or whatever but its really not their fault if they are. their born that way|`|llGCTNtTaa	Always|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	stop talking you could be doing clit bumping      ps a choice yes|`|8e61ac311eda0e888ee3a9de2be8875daa	It is my belief that we all have tendencies to be attracted to people of the same sex.  That attraction my not be a physical one, it could be more of an admiration.  Whether you choose to act upon that attraction is a choice.  Often times it is my belief that being gay is genetically linked.  Also, you have to live for yourself.  You cannot be afraid of what the world thinks of you.  If you love yourself, allow that radiance to be a reflection of who you are, not who you sleep with!|`|MGDtjCK1aa	no. you didnt choose to be attracted to other girls. you have said it yourserlf " i would so quickly turn str8" but its not a choice how your wired. thats your sexuality and i mean you can repress it and choose to date men that you feel no attraction to but that will cause you much heart ache. it is true this world is full of hate but that should not get in your way to be happy now should it?|`|wziDULJHaa	Well, this is something I debate back and forth with my mom about all the time.    I watched something on TLC (or was it the Discovery Channel?) once  about how a staggering number of people were born hermaphrodites (a person with both male and female genitalia) and the doctors either took care of it without informing the parents, or one of the genitalia parts were inside the body, not visible from the outside, and so nobody knew about it.      I do think, for some, being gay is a choice, especially if they are bisexual or they were in happy hetero relationships before.  But I do know a handful of gay people who you could tell from the womb they were gay.  The body is a complex thing and we can't possibly monitor every stage of its growth.  Some things can happen in development that can be missed by doctors, etc.    I think it's unfair to judge gay people so harshly over something they may not have any control over.  How can we judge something we are too ignorant about?|`|4gEUA4rZaa	no its not a choice. you dont choose who you like. But if it was a choice then there wouldnt be homosexuals in this world.
G9R6VZOXaa	Yes.  And I've not met one in the past two years who doesn't fit the stereotype|`|Hub1UGqPaa	Everyone is stereotyped.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	yes|`|uD1UFdRsaa	Who isn't stereotyped these days :/|`|fdkegbwgaa	yea you always see the bad stuff on the TV etc, there really should be more shown about the good that a lot of youngsters do, perhaps if that was on TV more of them would have a higher self esteem and then the world might be a better place!|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Obviously. Everyone is stereotyped. And, as much as I hate saying this, your stereotypical teenager has awful spelling and grammar. Just something to consider if you're trying to avoid stereotypes.    Edit: Your grammar is fine? Right! You said "dont think we should be stereotyped!! Im a very mature and honest teen but sometimes when im just in a shop or arround adults act like im doing something wrong!!!!!!"    Maybe it should read like, " I don't think teenagers should be stereotyped. I'm a very mature and honest teen, but sometime when I'm in a shop or hanging around, adults act like I'm doing something wrong".|`|1ab6f6ceaf0fe59ffa0df112b6c3ce9baa	sure  and very much|`|9Glwj7yCaa	All the time its stupid|`|WZO6gopKaa	some I whodunit say they all are|`|Y9qTbFFraa	ya lol but not me i'm perfect lol|`|AA11349925	Yes, the media only publicise the bad minority,|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	yes, just try not to be like the ones that give teens a "bad name" be positive!|`|AClmBnM3aa	ya absolutely|`|EbyjFYz8aa	Look kid should'nt you be watching scooby doo or doing your home work or something?

I think atheists are perhaps more likely to be educated about science and religions overall rather than any specific religion. I wouldn't say they're always more educated than believers though, certainly not in every subject.    Interesting questions though :)|`|6RiLrsuBaa	Well I for one think that opiates are awesome.|`|ucuP0boCaa	Oh hell yes. to both questions. If you look at the children who post on this board who are religious you should fear for the future of this country. Thje stupidity in the post of most irrationalist is amazing. Not to say that some of the atheist aren't bad. But there is no comparison to the stupidity exhibited by the irrationalist. I could go on this board and pull out dozens of examples in minutes of this stupidity.|`|UMg1CL7baa	yes, i completely agree with that statement|`|AA11709855	It will be realized soon anyway.|`|KT7cllsLaa	Agree in both instances|`|eloWO2piaa	Agreed 100%.    Seriously, any person that dismisses evolution because of a book written years and years ago when science was nonsense.. needs to go to a mental hospital.    Edit: Jenny is a classic case of 'nutcase'.    Jenny, I f*cked Jesus and the 365 Saints of the whole year. And I can tell you that his Father didn't bless him in one certain department.. We all know it comes from the Father's side! No wonder God is so wrathful..|`|XOnk1rBcaa	No. most people are not religious these days. Atheists are more educated, they can see that there isn't a god.|`|IvJvQi2Saa	Atheists have been proven wrong in every way. Only Jesus is the way.|`|L8FDYNhmaa	i really don't think so!    for me it's a matter of understanding about it because it changes life form bad to good, based on my experienced.|`|XOZiYqgUaa	More educated AND sexier...|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	Atheists tend to be more educated, yes, but not for the reasons you might have in mind. You see, its the educated, intelligent people who think about religions and from there some turn to be stronger theists while others turn to atheism.    Semi literate or people of lower status don't always think about religion, especially in an in-depth way. They usually have other things in mind.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	So, you're a commie.|`|s5xOMGcbaa	I have to disagree. Charles Darwin was a christian as was many early scientists. Are you going to tell me that Charles Darwin was less educated than some random atheist?|`|Jz3T68b6aa	Yes and Yes.    Religion was an organisation built by people with a common belief. In many cases, anything with a hierarchy is bound to be used for corruption and self-interest. In turn, false hope is given to the masses as a way to control their "knowledge".    Secondly, atheist tend to use the scientific approach to life's questions. Have a hypothesis, test it, correct it, continue while the religious people out there tend to ignore fact in favour of fiction.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	Yes, religion allows people to endure the suffering that they have in life by promising them an eternity of bliss.   The most successful religions even say that the more you suffer on Earth the better your chances of bliss.  Christians though the ages have been eager to martyr themselves and even inflict pain and damage their bodies for this promise based on words.      Atheists do not tend to be more educated.   More educated people tend to be atheists.    You need to get the cause and effect the right way round.    There are lots of very intelligent Christians, but there are very few intelligent fundamentalists.  (Charismatic ones yes, and devious ones too, but intelligent as in take existing knowledge and deduce new knowledge - very very few.)|`|Gf8GzwADaa	i agree that it has been used in such a way (and there are, sadly, current attempts to control people through its influence) but i would think that with the enormous wealth of information at our fingertips about our world and its machinations - thanks to centuries of scientific investigations - most people, provided their personal circumstances allow them the freedom to choose, are in a position to make a very deliberate and informed choice about faith and/or religion.     i do agree that education can free people from the chains of indoctrination and steer us away from blind faith. i guess it depends on how and why people use religion. some use it as a hiding place, some use it as a refuge, some use it in a very social context, some approach it on aesthetic grounds, others in a very private and personal context. in my experience, education has changed the way i think about the sacred but has not demolished its value nor its beauty.|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	Yes.... and yes...|`|f3nwI8ytaa	I think the first is reprehensibly elitist.  I agree with the second, although you might want to think about why it's true.  Is it not at least possible that highly educated people have been indoctrinated into the world view of their teachers?  There is a demonstrably anti-religious bias among university professors.  I know this both from surveys and personal experience.  The authority and superior knowledge base of professors is a powerful force in the classroom.  So I don't find it at all surprising that a large number of people who go through the education process at this level come to share their professors' bias.  How could it be otherwise?  The myth of disinterested pursuit of truth is just that: a myth.  Atheists are every bit as much a product of their training as the religious masses.      peace|`|S1A20Oouaa	no and no|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Opiates can be enjoyable ... just not in book form.|`|urIm4YaBaa	Regarding the opiate, I think it can be, will be, and has been used that way, but I don't think that controlling behavior is the only thing religion can ever be used for. If I might consider this from the view of a believer (which I'm not), I could point out that the greatest goods be corrupted for the greatest perversions.    I don't think Atheists are any smarter or more educated. Some are dogmatic followers of one philosopher or another; some just parroting whatever scientists say without actually seeking the knowledge necessary to evaluate the claims for themselves; and some are willing to shout out that they don't believe in a god, but refuse to consider certain philosophical questions that religion traditionally addresses.    This, of course doesn't apply to all Atheists, nor are believers completely ignorant and dogmatic (though many are). I don't think you can average it out and say that Atheists are somehow "better educated."    But we are sexier. No question.|`|346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	False religion is a racket and is misguiding.   But without having a higher power to look to, a huge amount of the population would be spiritual and emotional anarchists.   That's why Stalin wanted worship and killed anyone that got more attention than he did.    I know religious people that are very well educated.    I have to say I more or less disagree with you.

1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	Excellent point!  People do sometimes generalize about "religion" when they are specifically referring to Christianity or Islam or whatever.  Speaking in the U.S., Christianity is the pre-dominant religion and that may be why the generalization sometimes occurs.  But, I agree most religious people are peaceful.    I think most atheists (like myself) are peaceful, too.|`|yHfsHp6naa	It's not, but any theistic religion can be dangerous.|`|rTplTuEdaa	Many use religion for  evil,  Salvation  and a personal walk    with God is the answer.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	You are correct, the other beliefs are more loving and peaceful. I have never had a Buddhist knock on my door and tell me about the end of the world. I have never heard of crusading pagans killing nonbelievers  . I have never wanted to be a part of such a violent religion as Christianity.What does this tell you the symbol of Christians is a amulet that depicts the torturous death of its leader,this is grotesque.|`|AA11124121	After the death of Christ..the Ascension, after three days..was witenssed by a crowd of several hundred people.

You're talking about peace, but then you go and start arguments like this one. Very hypocritical.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny CHRISTIANITY OR JESUS, they believe in him as the noble prophet from God, they love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|WbaN6osZaa	I judge Nazis by Mein Kampf.

The term "religion", by definition, does not properly fit the practice of our faith to the God of the Bible, By grouping "Christianity" in with all other false faiths and practices and calling it another "religion" only goes to prove that Satan, the master deceiver of mankind, easily influences and manipulates the minds of those who are spiritually discerned and quick to judge on the sole basis of their own "spiritual blindness".|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Nobody said that Christianity is the only religion - that's idiotic. There are many different religions. You mean people refer to their belief as the ONE TRUE faith. Anybody can make that claim, and it may be true for them.    Another mistaken statement is that all adherents to other religions are peaceful. Start reading, the sooner the better. Religious violence is perpetrated by all religions including Buddhism by their extremist elements. Surely Israel, Northern Ireland and Afghanistan ring a bell? If not then perhaps 9/11 Iraq, Kashmir, Bosnia? Tip of the iceberg.    It's important to know that the reasons for fighting are numerous and varied and have more to do with human nature than God. Often it's a complex interaction of economic, racial, ethnic and geographic factors. Power, money, greed, intolerance, hatred are some good causes, even livestock has been at issue.     Before you go off and make a statement that Religion is the cause of wars, the history of human warfare shows that less than 7% of all wars have religious causes.|`|23kap6Feaa	because buddhists dont believe in a concept of hell you jew|`|vSWDNaDwaa	There are in excess of 10,000 religions. If you do not believe the doctrine of your current religion, find another one or get some fellow believers and start your own.    In the US and Canada, the vast majority of the people believe in a god and many are christians. Using there voting power, the christians influence the government and laws the entire country lives with. That is possibly why some persons get angry at the christians for attempting to force christian morals and beliefs onto nonbelievers. Fortunately people can freely speak and try to be tolerant of each-other. Peaceful coexistence is our goal. Unlike the some religious groups in the middle east who do not want to coexist, the want to dominate all others. Convert to the true religion or die is their belief. Well the rest of us just will not convert nor will we be forced to live the lives they dictate. We fight for our freedom...sometimes praying to the same god to smite our enemies.    Zule, the old guy    PS for Faith: Animal come from nowhere and go to nowhere. Why must we believe humans are a special type of mammal that comes and goes by the will of a god. Your logic is lacking a basis for the conclusion. Our ignorance does not mean there is a god.|`|If7d3qJIaa	Whilst i think your right and you cannot blame all religious people for violence in religion would like to make a small note that Buddhism and hinduism are not without there own share of violent followers.    The problem arises because whenever you label a sub sect of humanity whether it be by religion ,race, nationality, skin colour or any other way you care to name you isolate people, when people in that isolation try to exert control of others in there group the do so by means of fear and discipline, they then consolidate they power by telling there followers that anyone not in there sect is less than them and this leads to fear resentment and in a few cases violence|`|AA10873763	In the US, it may as well be.

The other religions don't face nearly the opposition that Christianity does due to Christian behavior. They bring it on themselves.    3. They face that kind of opposition because they spend so much time trying to make other people miserable and are the most powerful religion in the world.    4. YES YOU DO force your religion on others. Open your eyes. Harassing us in our homes, trying to force your religious beliefs into law while disrespecting other peoples religions and life, and a hell of alot more.    Get your head out of the sand.

KrkftOfkaa	Old west/western movie quick and dirty medicine terminology.  It's actually "Bite the Bullet."  When some were injured in the wilds or even small town without a regular doctor available sometimes the emergency medical treatment got crude.  In movies at least they would give someone a bullet to bite down on while say digging a bullet out of a flesh wound with a knife to help deal with the pain.  If it was available the first option would be to take a really good pull of whiskey (or some other strong spirt) to help deal with the pain.  If that wasn't available biting down on something was better than nothing.|`|JYXDj402aa	if someone "bites the bullet" it means to deal with the consequences of there actions|`|7ziKvIIpaa	idk. dont bite bullets?|`|5N6FqIfoaa	NO idea.|`|Fy9Muy6Waa	I've never heard "Dont bite the bullet" but biting the bullet is when you do something that's really hard, or you dont want to do, but you need to or have to, so you just do it anyway and dont cry about it.

When people had to have-say-a broken bone set- they would give them somethig to bite instead of having them scream bloody murder as they performed the painful whatever-it-was.|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	it means just deal with it. dont hold back, just take it...Man UP|`|XVCbQ92Gaa	If you know something is bad for you (pertaining to the bullet) then why would you still go after it (bite it)?

And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly consciousness, he will be transferred to Krsnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Krsna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life.

BAD ADVICE...  I would strongly urge you to 'get out' as fast as you can...then get some counseling on your own and find out why you 'attracted' someone who is an abuser...

BtygS0Hraa	There is a living prophet today!  His name is Thomas S. Monson!|`|bmhnXEsVaa	A Prophet not only has numerous revelatory gifts (1 cor. 12) but they are also used to establish, give direction, rebuke & discipline (in love). They work closely with Apostles. The testimony of Jesus you're referring to is understood as a prophetic spirit...when someone shares something & it stirs faith in you to also believe for it in your life. There is also the gift of prophecy, which is different from being a Prophet. Ephesians 4 says there are Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, Teachers & Evangelists. They are all ministries for today, but some Christians say that certain ministries (specifically the Apostles & Prophets) have ceased in todays' society.  A modern day prophet is David Wilkerson. You might also want to check out Elijahlist.com & click on "prophecy-last 50 words". Enjoy!|`|nHizaTiDaa	Prophets merely were "messengers" or the voice of God- to others.  God spoke to a prophet, the prophet passed along the message.  He always was to say "Thus says the Lord" and to just speak forth the message God gave him. Nothing more.    They had no psychic gifts. No special mental gifts at all.  Just chosen by God to pass a message along.  God spoke to them.      It would be as if I called you up- told you- This is what I want you to say- "I am sending a big tornado next week to pleasant city so go tell the people there to get out of town"  You, as prophet- your job would be to just go pass that message along.  Nothing magical about it.    If the prophet didn't say "Thus says the Lord" and even if he DID say that and the words didn't come true- God told the people to get rid of such folk.    But now that the complete work is done, Christ came died, and rose again there are no more Old Testament type prophets.

King David danced before The LORD with his genitals exposed.    2 Samuel 6:14, 20-23 * David, wearing a linen ephod, danced before the LORD with all his might... [20] When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, "how the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, DISROBING IN THE SIGHT OF THE SLAVE GIRLS of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!"* (*Michal knew that dancing before the LORD was BULL SH*T!) David said to Michal, "IT WAS BEFORE THE LORD* (*The wanking Bible writers are hinting that God pleasurizes himself watching a man dancing naked before him!) I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes* (*how kinky can King David get?). But by these SLAVE GIRLS you spoke of, I will be held in honor."* (hey, was King David trying to impress The LORD? or was he trying to catch the eyes of those SLAVE GIRLS???) And Michal daughter of Saul* (*BTW, this is the King Saul who prophesied naked among the prophets before the LORD, too) had no children to the day of her death.     The lesson in the Bible is that no wife can complain about a husband dancing naked exposing his genitals before some slave girls and The LORD! or he is bound to stop having sex with her until she dies! Thank God she can still become a lesbian there is no damning of lesbians anywhere in the Old Testament!!!    How about going naked for three (3) years as a sign and a wonder upon some oddball countries?  This is about the longest sustained stripping in the Bible! You dont have to say anything just go about your daily chores totally NAKED and let your athletic body speak for God!    Isaiah 20:2-3 (KJV) At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking NAKED and barefoot. And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked NAKED AND BAREFOOT THREE YEARS for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;      Hey, Christians got themselves a God that excels in refinements! They picked this Naked Prophet writings about an alleged virgin birth for God the Son Jesus Christ! (Isa 7:14-16)    The young prophet Micah used to go naked showing the effects of a heavy dose of hallucinogenics on himself!     Micah 1:8 Because of this I will weep and wail; I will go about barefoot and NAKED. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl. (Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus!!!)    Kids in public school can now read the Bible as another literature book It ought to be restricted reading for anyone under 18 years of age!|`|iaPtohhhaa	Two different types of prophet. One is a person who is specifically born into the world to fulfill God's specific purpose. This person is also called the Messenger of God who actually, through 'prophetic eye', receives God's message to the people at a specific time period. They can or cannot see vision as how you understand from your question. But the main thing is that they have a Message directly from God to the people. In other Words, they inteprete what God says and God will back that person up, often with genuine miracle vindication of God. There are a lot of examples in the Bible: Noah, Moses, Eljah, John the Baptise, Samuel, Ezekial, Amos, Jonah, etc.    Now, they can be impersonated. But to tell the gunuine from the false one is to see if the message they bring is according to the Bible or not and is fully vindicated by God and their life live according to Bible.     The other meaning of prophet is a person with the gift of prophecy. But that gift can be impersonated. The Bible says clearly if a person prophesy something and is not true or does not come to pass he/she is false. A genuine prophet does not need to have prior information to tell you something. Abstaining from saying but leave it till later is obviously an entirely different matter.     This is just a summary.

bYDVTv7Maa	Ugh, I understand where you're coming from.    I abhor fighting and my dad is a "true American patriot."    Needless to say, it brings about a lot of arguments in our house.    I do like freedom, and I do appreciate that we have it. However, that doesn't mean I have to support the way that we go about doing it. I believe that many of the conflicts today could be resolved without violence, and America probably could have avoided all this if they just learned to mind their own business in the first place. Ever since we became a nation, we've constantly been at war, with hardly any peacetime. And most of the time, the war didn't even include us to begin with! Now we've made enemies and we have to deal with it now.  Do I agree with the "War On Terror"? No. But I do believe we have to sort out the entire mess, and then we need to realize that we are not the "world police", we do not need to rush off to stop whatever we deem "wrong". If it's not hurting us, we need to stay the hell out of it.  A lot of conflicts could be resolved/avoided that way. We could also be preventing future conflicts by not making unwanted/unnecessary enemies.|`|urIm4YaBaa	Part of our freedom is the right to disagree with our government's decisions publicly and, if you're old enough, use your vote to help bring about the policies that you would endorse. Being an American is not the same thing as supporting anything our elected leaders do, including going to war.    Your decision to not join the military is in line with your pacifist stance, and in this nation you have a right to be a pacifist. If anybody has a problem with this, you can tell them that you aren't stopping them from enlisting.|`|IIhiSprlaa	No. Why would it be?  And on another note, I don't think that they mean they want to ship you off to Iraq. Not everybody in the military goes to war.|`|RC1r1tsHaa	true, some people take being against war the wrong way..    just because you are against war does not necessarily mean that you are not appreciative of the people that have died before|`|PDJjy0bPaa	I completely agree with you.  I don't know why some people just like fighting.  It's not wrong at all.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No it is not wrong.|`|AA11229634	Nope|`|WVPYem5Vaa	There is nothing wrong with being against war. You have your opinion, and you're entitled to it. You are not indebted to the ones who fought for the freedom, because you weren't born at that time, and you didn't get a say in that choice. It is not a problem to respect them, but that does not mean you owe them.|`|ybFg4umCaa	Yes, there are better things to spend money on. Imagine how much better  results it would have achieved if the US spent on aid to the region what it has spent on the invasions|`|xsZB4XDFaa	That is fine to be against war.  You have to understand that war has a time and place.  Your freedom (the way you live without Communist oppression or a Dictator) came from people who fought in past wars to protect you from Communist takeover.    To think that we are EVER free from being threatened in that way would not be wise.  I would have to say that a person would fall in the "completely naive" category to think that a Communist takeover couldn't happen to ANY COUNTRY!!    You can have your opinion.  But don't think that freedom is free!|`|5qjxyb0jaa	No it is not wrong , the bible says not to kill.
AA11618168	The same reason they don't make stupid illegal.|`|547Ln6rNaa	No really, it's a good question. They make smokers wait for operations longer then non smokers because they are more likely to die and therefore less worth the expense,  what about their rights? smoking is legal, same as over eating.    Really fat people cost a lot of money to treat, that's their choice too, as much as smoking is. Not a lot of fat people have a proper medical condition that isn't just "morbidly obese", to justify the weight.|`|c922cf4e78f4d4e7bcee15caae450236aa	prisons would fill up with fat people who cant do anything. we need more skinny people in there to make license plates.|`|WvfTOjRFaa	because you eat at your own risk.

But your right about we shouldn't have to pay for it.|`|OwHQrtEkaa	I imagine for the same reason being a judgmental asshole isn't illegal. All people have rights in society, and who are you to judge who should be punished or not for such idiotic reasons as being obese.

t7KHxE2Iaa	Congratulations!!    I have been having the same problem since quitting smoking and starting my own exercise routine! I don't understand why not smoking would make me so bored, but oh well.    I'm getting a PT time job, at least for a few months. I'll make some extra cash (and have something to fall back on if I get laid off) and it'll keep me busy. I'm so sick of flipping channels and daydreaming about cigarettes.    You could also volunteer! You'll feel good about yourself for doing it, so there's an extra benefit besides keeping busy. I think the trick is to get away from familiar places that may remind you of your old habits. Just try to stay really busy for a month or so and you'll pull through.    Side Note: My partner quit drinking a few years ago and it was pretty tough for her. Like you, she really enjoys the night life and it was hard to stay away. She took a second full-time job. Working 16 hours most days, she didn't have the time or energy to think about alcohol. When she finally quit the second job, the desire to drink never came back. Now she does just fine having a glass of wine on holidays or even a margarita at a restaurant occasionally.|`|GznItj4saa	I had a similar problem with drugs and in addition to the physical pain I had to find something to occupy my mind with so it wouldn't go into... very bad territories. I had a lot of problems concentrating at times. When I could, I read books, when I could, I went out on long pointless walks, when I could, I did yoga, when I could, I read a whole lot of smack on encyclopediadramatica, when I could, I bugged my boyfriend and friends on msn and phone, when I could, I wrote poems and stories, when I could, I painted, when I could, I climbed trees, when I could, I danced around my room alone. All for no reason whatsoever and my point is that you can pick up absolutely any activity that comes to mind. Don't think of it as some goal you need to achieve or something you need to do. Just do whatever you think you can do and only avoid what you need to avoid. There are a lot of pointless things worth discovering (no matter how idiotic that sentence sounds). Surf the web, go sing in the streets at night, scare people by jumping out of bushes. Anything goes.

iLFYj6Qgaa	The name India is derived from Indus, which is derived from the Old Persian word Hindu, from Sanskrit Sindhu, the historic local appellation for the Indus River. The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi, the people of the Indus.
e739a2c4e1e2dcb4dfddc6736311a5ceaa	They mean 'Nothing is sacred' and 'Follow your nature'. The sentence structure is correct.     The first one is a simple indicative statement. It could also be 'Nihil sacrum est' or even just 'Nihil sacrum' Romans often omitted the forms of 'to be' (est = is) when the meaning was obvious.     The second is a command form, telling one person to follow his nature.    For the script, just look at the capital letters used today. We use the Roman alphabet, and the letters look like what was used in classic Latin. Romans had fewer letters - there was no W, V was used for both U and V, and I was used for both I and J. The K was rare, and the Y and Z existed, but were rare; they were added late to be used in words borrowed from Greek. Letters were all capitals - lower case letters were a later development. Also, Romans did not show word division - all the letters ran together. Your quotes would look like this:    NIHILESTSACRVM   and  NATVRAMSEQVERETVAM    The link gives a good brief history.|`|ew7nQKXSaa	"Nothing is sacred"    "Follow your nature"

EPaYoJaiaa	I didn't like playing them at all and I hated gym. I'm not very athletic at all, every sport I tried I was just plain bad at. I, instead, was in the drama club and choir.    EDIT: In my opinion, sports are not necessary per say. Physcial excercise is but not playing a sport does not mean you will automatically become physically unfit or that you are not doing anything to keep healthy/active. I'm very healthy and very physically fit, always was and haven't played a sport since 6th grade (I'm now out of school all together)|`|LhCGU3F1aa	I stopped taking gym, cause i only needed it for one year.

I know that sounds corny, but people who are nice, try to be kind to others, and don't pepper every sentence with vulgarity are people who make others sit up and take notice. And when you have beautiful dark skin and a lovely smile, that makes you really special. We know several people who go to India on business trips, and they say the people in general are so thoughtful and kind, and most say the women are outstanding, and not because they are "hot" to an American way of thinking about people. They have no concept or preoccupation of or with their beauty, and that's very refreshing.|`|uD1UFdRsaa	They have such beautiful eyes, sense in clothing style. Especially the traditional sari robes.

Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:    1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.    2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.    3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.    The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc.     Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!

You can either read short hard texts and look up every word you don't know, or read longer easier texts and try to understand the meaning from the context (check occasionally that you have it right.)  2. Watch tv (preferably the kind you can pause) with someone whose English is better than yours and ask them occasionally what a word means. (I do this with my kids for German, I find they get annoyed if I ask more than one word or phrase every five minutes, but I can generally get away with that. I also sometimes do it with my husband for French, although my French vocabulary is pretty good. But I don't always know French French expressions (as opposed to Quebec ones). The pausing thing has made this much more pleasant for all of us.)  3. http://www.freerice.com|`|gUxpwEXbaa	I have a rather easy way to practice English and to improve your vocabulary at the same time. And this go to any other language you might want to learn.     When you wake up in the morning, pick up five random words from the dictionary, write them down and its meaning. During the course of the day make up phrases that the words would fit, at least five per word. Speak to friends and use the words youve learned.     Doing so in one year youll have learned almost 2000 new words in English!

AA11065099	I think that people have been rebuilding it all the time over the centuries, only not in one place.    I have read that the official plan is to have it rebuilt on its original site.  The initial target date was the year 2012, which is quickly apporaching.  However, for obvious reasons, rebuilding this temple on its original site would necessitate tearing down the significant mosque which stands on this site.  The Muslims not only would be offended, but might be moved to take up arms on the matter because of the symbolic nature of the move.  It could ultimately result in another world war, the results of which nobody could escape, even though some people seem to think they have sufficient protection or immunity from the effects.    I think this notion of re-establishing the original building is extremly ridiculous, especially since miniature replicas of it have gone up like McDonalds franchises all over the world, notably in North America.  They are called Freemasonry temples.  The Mormon temples are alleged to be exact replicas or the Temple of Solomon in the Bible.  I think they must actually have slightly different floor plans and structural arrangements, since some appear to be two story buildings and others do not seem to be as large.  The outward appearance is different, and maybe some of the areas that are open to the general public are arranged in a slightly different manner.  I would still have to remind you of going into diffferent McDonald's restaurants.  They might have about four different floor plans and yet they all look alike.|`|UxooffHZaa	Solomon's Temple is an internal metaphor.|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Well as I don't see any demolition work going on with the Mosque of the Dome of the Rock on temple mount, I doubt it!|`|503991d7e18cf8ad3b3864e35df39ec3aa	I don't know. but I believe they have the right to re-build it.  and if I could ..

Are there people who have plans, or collected materials - probably.  Is it some major, far reaching conspiracy - probably not.    One of the major problems is that another temple, the Islamic Dome of the Rock, currently stands on the traditional site of the original Jewish Temple.  The only remaining part of the Temple (and it is part of the later temple build by Herod, not the one by Solomon) is the famous Wailing Wall.      However some current archeologist are questioning the location of the original Temple.  It is possible that the Wailing Wall may NOT be part of Herod's Temple, but that the temple was a few hundred feet away from the Dome of the Roock.  Should enough evidence to support this be found (such as additional ruins and a foundation) at the alternate site, I would not be at all suprised to see a major effort to build a new temple on that alternate site, within feet of the Dome of the Rock.  (The Muslims are sure to love that idea....)    So it is entirely possible that the Temple could be rebuild at some time in the near future.|`|RiZ6KMqmaa	No but a temple will be built on the spot|`|v5BwnUZdaa	the jews are attempting it they have even bought stone to do it with.|`|9d9d3bb3d31c037c8e12d6a013e133f2aa	yes, i think it is going to be rebuilt but may not be being rebuilt at this very moment. by whom? i'm not quite sure on that part.|`|cByRtCC9aa	I'm guessing the Stone Masons would do it.

I say they can keep banging their heads against that wall.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpaN5EmkH...    Listen to what the commentator says.|`|9J8ciEwWaa	No the Temple will not be rebuilt for Christ is the only temple now.The Sacrifices were fulfilled with his death.    However there are endeavors to speed up the times of the end by the theology of bringing in the age of the messiah by building the Temple.   For some Jews the breeding of the Red Heifer is required, a pure red heifer for the the ashes of it are to cleanse the Temple. This is being done! Once the Temple is built again the Messiah will come. This is what some Jewish groups believe.    In Christian churches across America it is believed that the time of the antichrist will be ushered in if the Temple is rebuilt. Then the great tribulation and then the second coming of Christ. So to support any plans for the rebuilding is a means to the end for their agenda. To usher in the end of the world.  http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/22/...    Personally, I dont believe the Third Temple is planned to be rebuilt in Biblical prophecy. Certain churches claim Rev 11 v 1 as indicating that the Temple will be rebuilt, but Rev 11 v 19 goes onto say the Temple is in Heaven in fact it is opened in Heaven.|`|AA12037424	The Temple will be rebuilt, for in it the "abomination of desolation" that Revelation speaks of will take place in it when the Antichrist takes it upon himself to enter the area where the Mercy Seat will sit, claim it for his throne and pronounce himself to be God.|`|DTog0VZWaa	I know for a fact is it not.  I've been in the area & poked around.  There is contruction a distance away to repair falling down walkways & bridges.    The idea that's its' being built is propaganda used to rile up Arab Muslims into war.  That's all it is.  Israel put up a live camera on the spots of complaint so everyone could see - & that wasn't good enough.  Even though right there is are Arab Muslim representatives running the Temple Dome & Mosque, so they could tell it was live feed.    The willingness of the Arab world to believe conspiracy theories, & the willness of the world to believe conspiracies theories when they are about Jews & involve being "evil", "overly controlling of the world", & are insanely unlikely...is really something.    ==================  In Judaism:    - The Temple will be rebuilt -- that is if you don't believe it's allegorical which many Jews including some Orthodox do --- then it will only when the messiah comes which will be when there is peace on earth, so no destruction needed.    - The original Temple was built without metal instruments because they are a sign of war & it is a sign of peace, community, gathering, & even other nations around came to it.  So it is illlogical within Jewish concepts to imply it will be rebuilt using war.    - In Judaism the human being who is messiah will come when we we've all done enough to make the world is ready.  Doesn't look like we are there yet, eh?

55db1dbbab55471fd7e483514f53d0a4aa	Hi !  The primary passage that speaks about being single is 1 Corinthians 7. There Paul recommends that those who are single remain single for this present distress. (1 Corinthians 7:26) So his main concern was for a short time of persecution. He never recommends that everyone stay single. Early in the chapter he says that some must marry because of their desires.     He does list advantages to being single. But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. (1 Corinthians 7:32-35)     From a spiritual standpoint a single man has more time to concentrate on spiritual matters. Of course, if one doesnt use being single to spend more time in the work of the Lord, then this advantage goes away and there is no spiritual advantage to being single.     Not everyone should be married. Not everyone wants to be married. The Bible never insists that everyone be married.    Have a great day!|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	It is true that our first responsibility is to multiply and replenish the earth.  Man's greatest calling is be a husband and father.  Woman's greatest calling is to be a wife and mother.  Without the advent of good families on the earth, God's purposes would be frustrated.  It is His work and glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of mankind.  That requires procreation on the part of mankind to begin with.  Mothers in particular have a partnership with God in bringing His children into mortality.    It is my opinion that women who intentionally and willfully elect not to have children, preferring to look out for their own welfare, will one day regret their choice.  You will be like the unwise, slothful servant that took his one talent and hid it in the earth for fear of losing it.  When the Lord returned, he gave back the one talent the Lord had given him.  The Lord was displeased because he had done nothing with what he had been given.  I think that men and women that do not bring a family back with them to Heavenly Father's presence will find an equally unhappy Lord.  Now, on the other hand, if you do not marry and have children for no fault of your own, the opportunity never presenting itself, then there is no blame or shame in that.  The Lord will give you the opportunity and blessings you deserve when you arrive in the spirit existence.  I have a good aunt that lived out her life serving her father and brothers and never got married.  I asked her about it once and she said that she had offers but they weren't what she was seeking.  I interpreted that to mean that she had certain standards that she wanted in a marriage and that she never found the offer that matched those standards.  I will not judge her on the strictness of her standards, whether she was too choosy or picky, but rather upon the good life she led in spite of her lack of marriage.  I think God will do the same.  You can determine for yourself whether your lack of marriage falls into the selfish or high standard category.  I do hope that you haven't closed the door on marriage.  At least leave the possibility open.  The right opportunity may come along when you least expect it.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	No, Jesus said there are some who will never marry...He said to let those who can accept that accept it..

It is ok to be selfish.......We should all be selfish now and then...there is nothing wrong with it.

Hell is on earth.You sound like someone who knows yourself and that is a huge plus.Good for you.|`|eiim3tJuaa	No. Acctually, it's better if you don't marry.    Matthew 19:8-12  8Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery."     10The disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry."     11Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. 12For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it."    1 Corinthians :1-3, 32-35  1Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. 2But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. 3The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.    32I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairshow he can please the Lord. 33But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this worldhow he can please his wife 34and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this worldhow she can please her husband. 35I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.|`|CfWXgwxBaa	Congratulation,intelligent girl !

God is clear on his stance for those who do not deem it necessary to marry or have a family.

They have their kids around when it's fun or convenient and ignore them at other times. We've all seen that and it's terrible consequences for the children.

But you can stay unmarried and not have children and still not be commiting a sin, only if you commit adultery while your unmarried it's a sin.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Salvation from hell does not depends on number of kids, or having a husband or not.

I would not wish children on anyone who does not feel cut out to be a parent.

If your friends say that you are selfish I'm sure you will be able to point out several people with children who are selfish as well.

qky7gWosaa	(Qibla The Praying Direction).    Thus We have made you (true Muslims - real believers of Islamic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah, a just (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger (Muhammad) be a witness over you.  And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e. disobey the Messenger).  Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allah guided.  And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered towards Jerusalem).  Truly, Allah is full of Kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.     Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad's) face towards the heaven.  Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid-al-Haram (at Makka).  And wheresoevers you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.  Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (youre turning towards the direction of the Ka'ba at Makka in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.     And even if you were to bring to the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction), nor are you going to follow their Qiblah (prayer direction).       (Position your feet about shoulder width with arms to side.)    Abu Hurairah (RA) relates: The Messenger of Allah prohibited putting one's hands on one's hips during the salah.   (Abu Dawud)    (Place the right hand on the left.)    The people were ordered to place the right hand on the left forearm in As-Salat (the prayer).  (Bukhari 1.707)    He (Pbuh) passed by a man who was praying and had placed his left arm on his right, so he pulled them apart and placed the right on the left. (Ahmad & Abu Dawood, Saheeh Isnaad).    Takbir (Allahu Akbar).    I was sitting with some of the companions of Allah's Apostle and we were discussing about the way of praying of the Prophet. Abu Humaid As-Saidi said, I remember the prayer of Allah's Apostle better than any one of you. I saw him raising both his hands up to the level of the shoulders on saying the Takbir. (Bukhari 1.791)    --    Hadrat Abu Hamid as Sayidi (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated amongst ten of the companions of the Prophet (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him): I know better than you about the prayer of Allah's Messenger (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him).   He said: When the Prophet (may Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) stood for prayer, he raised his hands till he took them opposite his shoulders, then he recited takbir, then he read (the Qur'an), then he recited takbir and raised up his hands till he took them opposite his shoulders, then bowed placing his palms upon his knees, then making himself straight, neither lowering his head nor raising it up. Then he raised up his head saying, "Allah hears one who praises Him": then he raised up his hands till he took them opposite his shoulders by being straight: and he said: "Allah is the greatest." Then he lowered himself to the ground in prostration keeping his hands away from his two sides and bending the toes of his feet, he raised up his head and bent his left foot and sat on it, then he sat straight till every bone returned to its proper place. Next he prostrated and said: "Allah is Most Great", raising himself, and bent on his left foot and sat on it. Then he sat straight till every bone returned to its proper place. Then he stood up and did the same thing in the second Rak'at. At the end of the two Rak'ats he stood and said takbir raising up his hands till he took them opposite his shoulders, just as he recited takbir when he opened the prayer, then he did the same in the remaining portion of his prayer till when the prostration in which there was Taslim, he put out his left foot and sat on his hip bone upon his left side. Then he uttered Taslim. They said: You have spoken the truth. He used to pray thus. (Abu Dawud)|`|vnty8yOgaa	Do Salaat sincerely with Hands straight or folding.

Why is this matter so complicated that the Ahl-us-Sunnah today offer prayers in five different ways? And what is the correct way, then?    Let's take a look on what the scholars of Ahl-us-Sunnah have to say about this:    - The Hanafiya instruct men to hold their hands below the belly, with the right hand over the left, and the women should place both hands on their chests.    - The Hanabla instruct both men and women to hold their hands below the belly, with the right hand over the left.    - The Shafi'i explain that its Sunnah for both men and women to hold their hands, with the right hand over the left, and place them above the belly and below the chest.    (Source for above three: Al-Fiqah 'al-al-Madhahib Al-'arb'ah, volume 1, page 399-400, by Allamah Abdur Rehman Al-Jaziri. Published: Ulema Academy, Department of Auqaaf, Punjab)    - These three Imams of the Ahl-us-Sunnah were born hundreds and thousands of miles away from Medinah. However, the fourth Imam, Malik ibn Anas was born in the city of our Prophet , i.e. Medinah. He grew up in the blessed company of some of the finest Tabi'een, or the direct descendants of the Companions , who called Medinah, the city of the Prophet their home. He saw them praying with their hands opened and on their sides all through his youth and so he gave the fatwa to his followers to pray in that manner.    Allamah Ghulam Rasool Saeedi writes about Imam Malik in Sharah Muslim as follows:    "Imam Malik instructs us to pray with the hands free. He considers it makrooh, or dislike, to hold hands while offering obligatory prayers and this is considered by him allowable in super-prayers (nafl).    (Source: Sharah Muslim, volume 1, page 590, published Lahore)    - The Ahl-al-Hadeeth consider the hadith found in the five sahih books that indicates the holding of hands as weak. They consider it sunnah, or way of the Prophet , to fold their arms over their chests. It is the same way in their religion for both men and women.

BPFDMFitaa	They believe he was infallible in his revelation not in his every day life.......    Edit: Dawn>>> I can't do that, because we believe Prophet Muhammad (s) is infallible in his revelation and all aspects of his life, look into it, i am with you on this, but your view is not the Sunni view........    If you look at islam4life answer you will know, Abassa (He frowned) has nothing to do with Prophet Muhammad (as), istagfurullah.....    If Prophet Muhammad (as) was not INFALLIBLE!!! then all the hadith books should be put in question.....    Edit: Islam4life would you rather it was your Prophet that frowned, you do not want to accept that it was Uthman, but quit content that it was the most beloved Prophet and best of creation the messenger of Allah Muhammad (as)      "Whoever obeys the Messenger, he indeed obeys Allah." (Quran 4:80)    "....and obey not from among them a sinner or an ungrateful one." (Quran 76:24)       The picture is complete!     "The prophets are to be obeyed," and "the sinners are NOT to be obeyed." The only conclusion is that the prophets were NOT sinners or wrong-doers. In other words, they were infallible (Ma'soom) and sinless.     "And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and from whatever he forbids you, keep back." (Quran 59:7)     Now tell me, if  Prophet Muhammad (s) was a sinner as some ignorant people allege, then how can Allah. order us to accept that which could be sinful?     Fear Allah!!!! in your reasoning. For those who argue and say that the verse Abassa is about the Prophet (s),  I would say to you such assertion is baseless and void of any reason or logic.  EVERYTHING the Prophet (s) spoke was from Allah, even when he said good morning!!!! How can you claim that the messenger of Allah can sin?  How can he (s) be a sinner?  Exalted be Allah!!!    Brother Muhammad K, being Human like us, does not mean he has to sin, as you know sin comes from Satan......|`|03Xx7l8Baa	Do you remember the time the Prophet Muhammed was talking with the tribe leaders and a blind man came up to him to ask him a question. The leaders laughed at the Prophet (PBUH) and told him these are the people that follow you. The Prophet upset by this turned his back on the blind man.     Later an aya was revealed;    He frowned and turned away when a blind man came his way. How do you know if (his heart) might be purified or recall (God) and by recollection be rectified? For those who are called wealthy, you attend to them closely and dont bother if they are purified! Yet from one who comes to you hopeful, fearful and clearly humble, you let your attention be shunted aside. - (Quran 80:1-12)    http://www.balagh.net/english/quran/ligh...  http://darvish.wordpress.com/2008/03/10/...    However we know that the Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) has all his sins forgiven, yet he would pray until his legs and feet were swollen and when asked why, he replied, should i not be a grateful servant?.    He was human. When he died, many companions were filled with such grief that they denied his death. However Abu Bakr reminded them and said no doubt whoever worshiped Mohammed, Mohammed is dead, but who worships Allah, Allah never dies. (See 39:30)    This is just an example of how we see that he was only a human.  But a human sent by Allah to perfect good manners and as a mercy to mankind.    REPLY to Dawn; the second aya of the surah 'abasa says   an jaa'aho al'amaa.  The word jaa'a means come or came, so we agree that it is the blind man (yes ibn umme maktum) who came. Came to whom? The prophet. Now the aya before that is abasa wa tawallaa, he turned and frowned. Sunnis agree this is talking about the Prophet (PBUH).     "He (the Prophet) turned and frowned,(1) when there came to him the blind man.(2)"    So it is illogical to say the blind man turned and frowned when there came to him a blind man. Agreed?     Now, you say this surah was revealed about the blind man not the Prophet (PUBH). It was revealed to the Prophet about this situation with the blind man and TEACHING him how he should act. This was still in the beginning of his mission and his dismissal for the blind man was not out of contempt or neglect, but rather he was focusing his attention on the most influential people of society to accept the message so that his task may become easier.    But this surah shows how much Allah (SWT) loved his Messenger (PBUH) and wanted to show him the correct method of extending invitation of Islam. Just like when a teacher wants to prove or stress on how important it is to turn in their assignment and tells the top A kid that if he doesn't turn it in then he will get a zero. If the teacher is saying this to the best of them, then all the other students get the point and they better do it and turn it in!    ---So our beloved Prophet (PBUH) made a mistake, and out of His (SWT) love for him and us he made an example for us to follow.--- If he was flawless, then that would make him godly. And we all know what a sin it is to say that.|`|AA12386598	I believe that God is infallible and I believe Muhammad pbuh was a human and therefore fallible, but it also part of the muslim belief in prophet-hood that Allah kept all prophets free of sin.

However, I support Polygamy|`|vzWGml26aa	that vid is rich. i love it when he says i don't care.   none around here knocking on my door.   this place around here where i live is called the bible belt.   the churches would knock the atheists head with a bible to get his brain right.|`|otEpwY5eaa	I'm Aussie and I've never had an Atheist come around...    LMFAO! That's hilarious =D    To be honest.. as an Atheist, I invited mormons to come back and talk about their religion the next day.    Why? Because one of the mormons used to be a bad a.ss... and he was damn good looking.  It was the next day that they came over, that he told me he was wrapped up in his religion and had no interest in the opposite sex.    After that day and promising to go and check out their church the next saturday, I never looked at another morman guy again.|`|sjERiFeNaa	hahaha.. is this off the chaser or something?? lol    if an athiest door knocker came to place- it would be me listening to him, and then hed have to listen to me why i show him why i believe he is wrong. there is so much proof that God is real and that he is a loving, great God. :)|`|zfFjKhJJaa	Yes    I told him to gtfo until he shows me some evidence|`|zQyslfHKaa	I had a vacuum salesmen come in one time, I am certain he was an Atheist, because he said that I didn't have to believe him without proof.    Turns out that Vacuum did pick up allot of dirt....|`|s5xOMGcbaa	That was a great video.|`|7hpXsYOCaa	Lol,Knock knock!!|`|vLnS4JJaaa	What would this person have to offer?    Nothingness and an eternal dirt bed, I suppose.    Not much of a salesman.
5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Your idea of looking really nice maybe too much for most men.  Men like natural looking women, touchable looking women.  Women like a solid make up and hairstyle before they feel 'done'.  Don't get me wrong, men like make up, they just like it when it doesn't call attention to itself.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Most guys like the comfortable look.  It is like you are one of us.  We are more intimidated if you are dressed to kill.|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	Since you look comfortable, you appearance has a comfortable, causal effect. more approachable.|`|ZImavV2Oaa	because when your all done up you probably look like your high maintenance. and when your casual guys feel like "hey....i could watch a football game with that chick....she's cool"        men would rather have an easy going ugly chick than a high maintenance pain in the *** and dont let anybody tell you any different.
ErN3pbTeaa	I'd still be living in Minnesota with my dad and his family. I'd have a girlfriend, and more friends. I'd still be in the same college. I'd be really into sports because I wouldn't have been bullied in gym class so much, so I would have enjoyed them. I wouldn't smoke cigarettes, but I'd still be smoking weed (step brothers).   Basically everything (for the most part) would be happier than it is now. Being gay sux!|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Just as frustrating. I live for frustration. I'm trying to change. Because change is good. And Obama tells me so.|`|e7gkttgcaa	I would live a normal life    ...I have a lot of family problem because of it|`|XjLvbfTZaa	Being lesbian is just a tiny part of me so I imagine it would be the same as it is now, except I wouldn't mind so much that there are currently no other gay people in my life outside of the "virtual" world.|`|srIv25b9aa	life would b a hell of alot easier....but also less interesting.|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Hmmm......i would probably won't be as depressed as I am right now, so I think I would be just like any normal guy with the same cycle, grow up, high school, college, work, get married, have kids, got promoted, retired, and that's it.|`|0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	I'd probably be some womanizing man, like many other straight guys are. Just in it for the sex.     lol...    Being gay teaches you the value of love b/c sadly, we are forced to prove it to those who oppose it; that it is just as normal as what they feel.|`|plBN572qaa	lol, i asked my friend this one time (she thought i was straight when she first met me), but she said that i would be very lucky.....i don't think i'll ever know what she meant by that...:(|`|LURqbzoZaa	Exactly like it is now. haha|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	i dont know but i would sure miss *****! wow dont even wanna think about it.|`|FuJQjHmUaa	much more boring|`|JXH8SDqOaa	I would be an obnoxious twerp, with a wife and 2 kids.    Oh, no, wait, that's my twin.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Hmmm...well from the 'straights' I've met, I'd say self serving, self righteous, bigoted, hateful people who refuse to allow everyone the right to be who and what they are...'if it isn't envisioned within the 'straight' world it shouldn't, or doesn't, exist...  I've rarely, if ever, met any gay person who has the propensity for discrimination and bigotry that 'straight' people seem to have...|`|S9JY6N0iaa	Apart from not dating guys, hmmmm  Not alot all my friends are straight (or 99% of them are). I dont do the "scene". I like sports, boyfriend thought was straight when we first meet, lead to him being a bit confused when started chatting him up lol.  So life be as boring if straight|`|AA11672481	I wouldn't be nearly as sure of myself as I am now. If I were straight, then I wouldn't have been forced to reexamine the world. I would have  been a lot more ignorant of my surroundings. I would know a lot less about why people do the things that they do.|`|ng8ILmkOaa	since I've lived in both worlds, I can assure you that it's a lot easier, and not that different. I mean, if you're a horny person, you are a horny person whether you are straight gay or bi.  the only thing different with being staright is you are accepted more in this retarded world of ours.|`|tuR7uui1aa	It would probably be a lot easier tbh...but it sure would be more boring. Plus guys are hot. Who'd want to give up that?|`|W8iDn9hhaa	pretty damn boring...   |`|oiPrycbJaa	Easier life really, and plenty more fish available for me to be quite honest with you.|`|20d09b00f62ad79a5e4a77484ecead92aa	I actually tried that for most of my life.  I was married to a man for 8 years and it didn't work.  Not sure if it was because I'm not so straight or because of who he is as a person.  We are friends now who happen to have a child together.  If I were living the straight life, it would be easier to exist on the outside for everyone else, however I would be miserable on the inside.  One round in life is all we get and I intend to be happy while I'm here.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	I'm glad I was bisexual actually. I come from a very anal, religious background, and I would hate to think that I would have ended up like them.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	I dont honestly think it would be that different to how it is now.    Aside from the fact I married a man, for all intents and purposes, I lead a "straight" life|`|N73oZyY8aa	If I had to listen to a woman whine at me and nag and pout when she doesn't get her way, I'd either be in jail or dead because I'd kill one of us.    As much as I appreciate the ladies, I do not want one in my household.|`|R4EYPeLGaa	The same. My sexual orientation isn't that much of me. =] =]    huggs

Well those are just 2  words to me which have emerged as of lately to mean NOTHING! However I accept the fact that my partner, my best friend, my cat|`|LjsRfaskaa	Or from above, the eagle. :)  You should add this one to your lists, it it the objectivity of things and will allow you to think out of the box. :)    For things that generate great emotion like grief we are overwhelmed by it into not being able to think much at all.    But what you have to understand is that we are not a physical body with aspirations towards spirituality. We are a spiritual being whos frequency has condensed into solid matter. The lower and denser the frequency the more solid and heavier we feel.    To dispearse the heaviness we can listen to inspirational music, healing frequencies, gather with friends, etc to lighten us. That will trigger our ability to think straight at the very least.    Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|AA10554783	Fire:Positive_Aggressive vitality...  You recall happily the love and warmth that you shared together|`|6dL7UGvfaa	Earth+ because I believe out of my own experiences that everything that happens is for good of all concerned and hence, I accept and move on.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	I would like to think that I would react as I live... Wind/Positive    But I am fortunate enough to say that I've never lost a partner, so until I'm faced with that, I can't really know.  I do know that when dark things have touched my life and I am hurting, it seems that's when it's been hardest for me to focus on my  spirituality, even though that is when I've needed it the most.     It's easier to have a pity party...|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Probably in disbelief at first and then weeks of crying|`|tzwjSxGtaa	be happy for them that they're no longer on hell|`|9m2LvlWdaa	How the hell should I know?|`|GtazNrplaa	I would like to think that I would be stable enough to comfort others of our grief and be flexible enough to recall all those happy moments shard in life together, as we all have to die sometimes and move on to somewhere else in spirit and memoirs held together by the love that had existed.|`|TCehI17kaa	Would be hurting for quite some time.|`|OxnyOaxGaa	Yes what Raluque said.........|`|YZdTBWoCaa	My partner is dying from ovarian cancer.

As said in Shrimad Bhagvad Gita physical body is just an attire for the soul which keeps changing in every birth. we meet all those whom we hated or loved in past lives and also those who will teach us some lesson.   sooner we understand better we will be even after the death of our partner. easier said than done.

sVyH0jTiaa	There are million of way to tell a lie.  Very little lie is equal big lie.  If you knew you were lying it will make you feel bad.  Some people think you are lying but you were telling the truth but some people don't trust people because too many people telling too much lies.  But there is something else I did like to add to this; If a person want to change his or her mind then that person changed his mind then sudden people call that person a liar.  It is hard for humans to tell if that person is telling the truth or lies. But only Jehovah God will know if you tell a lie or not.  Some time when you see something and you were telling the truth but later you realized what you saw wasn't truth but too late you tell everyone what you saw then they call you a liar.  It is really depend on what the person really said.  Just like many men in prison they go to jail for rape women. But they find out lot of men didn't do it because of DNA.  Well all those thing I explained is really tough one but The main thing I hate is THE FATHER OF THE LIE!!!!!!!!!!!|`|PjwWWMu4aa	There is a lot of work on the subject of lies and untruths. Kant said, as you do, that telling fibs is always wrong. The Utilitarian model, which I favour, states that lies can in fact be good. This is an oldie but a goodie:    "You are a very nice person in 1930s Germany, hiding an (alive - you're not a serial killer) family of Jews under your floorboards. One day the Gestapo knock on the door, and quite plainly ask you if you're hiding Jews in your house."    Now, in that hypothetical situation, Kant would be forced by his principles to condemn that family to death. The utilitarian model allows me, however, to do the humanitarian thing and attempt to save the family by lying to the police.    Granted, that's an extreme example, but it does illustrate the point rather nicely. Lies used to stop a greater wrong taking place can indeed be, and are, good. I'm not saying its right to lie gratuitously, and it should probably be avoided if you want to remain trustworthy to your peers, but untruths do have their place on this side of morality.|`|ern87uWhaa	Depends on the reason for lying.|`|97031ab5ff9bcf387a9d1278f60ddafeaa	*** w07 2/1 pp. 6-7 Why Be Truthful? ***    Every lie is an untruth, but not every untruth is a lie. Why not? A dictionary defines a lie as an assertion of something known or believed by the speaker to be untrue with intent to deceive. Yes, lying includes the intention to deceive someone. Hence, to speak an untruth unwittinglysuch as giving someone incorrect facts or figures by mistakeis not the same as to tell a lie.    Moreover, we need to consider whether the person asking for information is entitled to a comprehensive answer. For instance, suppose Manfred had been asked the same questions by an executive of another company. Would Manfred have been obliged to tell him everything? Not really. Since that executive had no right to such information, Manfred would have had no obligation to provide it. Of course, even in this case, it would have been wrong for him to tell a lie.    What example did Jesus Christ set in this regard? On one occasion, Jesus was conversing with some unbelievers who showed interest in his travel plans. Pass on over from here and go into Judea, they advised him. What was Jesus reply? You go up to the festival [in Jerusalem]; I am not yet going up to this festival, because my due time has not yet fully come. Shortly thereafter, Jesus did travel to Jerusalem for the festival. Why did he answer that way? They were not entitled to know the exact details of his whereabouts. So while Jesus did not utter an untruth, he gave them an incomplete answer in order to limit the possible harm they could do to him or to his followers. This was not a lie, for the apostle Peter wrote about Christ: He committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.John 7:1-13; 1?Peter 2:22.    What about Peter himself? On the night of Jesus arrest, did not Peter lie three times and deny knowing Jesus? Yes, Peter caved in to fear of man and lied. But he immediately wept bitterly and repented, and his sin was forgiven. Moreover, he learned from his mistake. Some days later, he spoke in public about Jesus and resolutely refused to stop when threatened by the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem. Surely Peters temporary setback and quick recovery should be an encouragement to all of us, who can easily be overwhelmed in a moment of weakness and stumble in word or deed.|`|dIxQ9rV5aa	Never!      The Etiquette reason:    Any time we contradict ourselves to someone, we're telling them that they're not worthy of being told the truth - or of bothering to remember what we've told them.  I couldn't help but notice that the very people who need to remember what lie they told to whom, are the same people who NEVER remember.  (See the The Psychological reason below, for the cause of this.)    The Spiritual and Scriptural reason:    God created man in His image, but when we lie, we re-make ourselves in the image of the father of the lie.    The Legal reason:    It shows that we are ethically and morally inept, and sooner or later, that's going to land us in serious trouble.    The Psychological reason:    Lying creates a schism between the mind and reality.  The more we lie, the further from reality our minds become.  Once we become a basket case, we may as well climb into the proverbial hand basket and go for a ride.|`|77Ng0HT8aa	No. It's never right to lie. I have lied in the past and every single time I told the other person found out or I couldn't remember what I said and it was so hard to cover it up and make it seem like I was telling the truth. Now the only time I lie is white lies to be nice to people like 'oh your haircut is great!' lies like that you need to tell to be a decent person.|`|xDfPtDboaa	If your wife asks "do these pants pants make my butt look big?" you have to lie if she has a big butt. If she has a tiny butt that looks great in those pants you don't have to lie. The problem here is the motivation of the person asking the question. your wife doesn't want the truth, she wants a compliment.|`|4q66CvgLaa	no its not ok to lie .you never know where that lie leads to . jehovah hates lying as rightly stated satan is the father of the lie and by lying whom does one serve , can a liar be truly trusted also as time goes on it becomes more difficult to remember what lie was told but if a lie wasn't told its easier to remember what was said and have a better conscience|`|Dkx9dQwaaa	Hello, sister.   You're right.   Lying is one thing that God hates.     We do not have to lie, because God does not lie.    If you lie, then we are children of the devil.      Greetings.

zt3xu4a8aa	Perhaps it is because people in some religions confuse faith with blind obedience. Making people feel bad if they do not conform is one way of controlling them.    I think we must all question and use our minds to our best abilities in order to feel grounded and at peace with ourselves. Even so, there will be times when we have done all that we can and still may not have the answer. My definition of faith is to do all that I can do to bring good to others and myself, and when I fall short, to trust that God will do the rest. Therefore, it is not wrong to question and to try to figure things out.     Quite the contrary, in fact. If I follow "the rules" just for the sake of the rules when they do not make sense or ring true to me, then I am practicing falsehood. I don't believe that God would lead His children by coercion.    I think it is the mark of an intelligent and compassionate person to first be able to question without self condemnation, and secondly to be able to allow others to do so as well.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Logic works within a network of presuppositions.  It cannot cause them.  If you are Christian, then you assume God's self-disclosure through revelation, history, and nature, etc..  So if your logic violates your presuppositions, it is by definition invalid.  Intellectual faith operates on the level of presuppositions.  Personal faith is loyalty to them (loyalty to God in Christ in your case).  If this is true, there can be no conflict between logic and faith.  Where we run into trouble is our tendency to absolutize our reasoning.  We cannot see how we are wrong and so assume, against the community of faith, that everyone else is mistaken.  It isn't logic and our use of it, but rather our stubborn resistance to correction that leads us into rebellion.  Humility is the first principle of reason.  Without it our ability becomes a snare.     On a more personal note, I am engaged in a war against blind faith.  Those who claim faith as the sole basis for their beliefs have abandoned truth.  Such "faith" is actually a nihilist will to power.  It's root is in unbelief.  You aren't the only one who runs into trouble with Christians over this stuff.      peace|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	I'm a Christian and I believe in using the brains God gave us.  As far as I'm concerned, thinking for yourself is not a sin.  Questioning something in the Bible or beliefs and practices of other Christians is not the same thing as questioning God.  By the same token, if I find something in the Bible which does not make sense or is contradictory, it has no impact on my belief in God.  God is still God.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Christ taught to look for proof, so you are right on track. He said: by their fruits ye shall know them.

I have also been a christian for many years, and have been taught to question.  I guess it would help to know examples.  But I do get what you are saying.

And I say... accepting, humility and faith are the key words. Because all answers may be taken only from Bible, and that makes Christianity closed in itself.

I still like to believe that Jesus exists but I dont let mysef follow Him, even seeing the world getting screwed up. I just live, watch, think and wait for a fate. Mind is more important in most cases.|`|86218b3eee8a27ac46cd66ace3e43a3daa	The definition of faith as the Bible presents, truly involves logic & reasoning:    (Heb 11:1-2) .?.?.1?Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld. 2?For by means of this the men of old times had witness borne to them.    The rest of the chapter deals with men & women of great faith, that if we act accordingly can have a strengthening affect for us!    There are instances in the Bible to help us in identifying how our faith can be strengthed!    (Jas 1:5-8) 5?So, if any one of YOU is lacking in wisdom, let him keep on asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching; and it will be given him. 6?But let him keep on asking in faith, (not "blind faith--my comment) not doubting at all, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about. 7?In fact, let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from Jehovah; 8?he is an indecisive man, unsteady in all his ways.    A warning when we are on our way to a healthy faith, that we be careful the we are not blown about like waves on the sea as to be influenced by teachings of men , that we cannot become decisive , as much as is humanly possible!    The apostles had difficulty with having a strong faith , so indeed they asked Christ for help:    (Lu 17:5-6) 5?Now the apostles said to the Lord: Give us more faith. 6?Then the Lord said: If YOU had faith the size of a mustard grain, YOU would say to this black mulberry tree, Be uprooted and planted in the sea! and it would obey YOU.    The important thing. was they asked for help, and were encouraged by Christ words, as he talked to them, in constancy!    An important matter is that one find a people or organization, (if indeed there is body of people)that try their best to rid their doubts, because Satan is the chief false accuser  those who truly follow Christ as a group & individually:    (Re 12:10) .?.?.Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God!      More to come.....

vf9g9bExaa	The LBRP is magickally used for a multitude of reasons.  It is considered a foundation for the Golden Dawn.  No, it does not banish the elements; it does banish any negative forces/energy.      "It was created by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a mystical order founded in 1888 by three British Freemasons: S.L. MacGregor Mathers, William Wynn Westcott, and William Robert Woodman. Before the Order disbanded in 1900 (splintering into multiple separate organizations), it contained such famous members as the Irish Poet W.B. Yeats, authors A.E. Waite and Dion Fortune, and the so-called "Wickedest Man in the World", Aleister Crowley."    "it incorporates many layers of complex symbolism within its structure. It is used primarily to banish unwanted negative influences from the space of the magician, but has a multitude of other uses as well, such as centering oneself, expanding one's aura, aligning oneself to the energies of the sun and clearing temple space before and after evocation rituals. Aleister Crowley, when speaking about the LBRP said:    "Those who regard this ritual as a mere device to invoke or banish spirits, are unworthy to possess it. Properly understood, it is the Medicine of Metals and the Stone of the Wise."     I also recommend Donald Kraig's books especially 'Modern Magick'.  He's easier to read than Crowley, Regardie, or Waite.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	i don't know of anyone who performs the lbpr while casting circle.  the technique may be similar, but the intention is entirely different.  in my personal work, i don't use the wiccan formula, anyway.  i cast a continuous circle three times around instead of inscribing a circle and then calling in entities.  i find ceremonial magic to be tedious and ineffective, but that's just me.|`|24H5tznkaa	I know what you're talking about but I don't use it in my practices. I don't feel the need to banish anything. When I close down my circle, I use my ritual broom to disperse the left over energies. When casting the circle, I have already made sacred space, so in my opinion, any energies and entities that are in there with me have been welcomed and they depart when I close out the circle...to end it with a banishing ritual would mean to me that I have been in my circle with something that needs to be banished...if that's the case, I didn't do a good job consecrating my space to begin with.      In my opinion, all that's left over is residual energy.    There are so many different ways to circle cast and different forms of witchcraft in general. I would be interested to know what the reason is for banishing elements from a circle, just for the sake of knowledge, if you care to share it.|`|LUiiAlsJaa	they fear the very forces they summon and hide from them|`|baW9sSsLaa	*is amused*    I don't think I've ever used that ritual for any circle I've cast.|`|9df77ae12f17971731e9883919813c91aa	my circle is very simple...i don't use any structured rituals.  i never have.    probably why i'm a solitaire.    bb|`|8HQEiltbaa	I'm with Sherl on this one.

Did he tell it to you or did you read it from the words written by Moses?      Do you mean that you keep the Sabbath by doing no work on the 7th day or that you keep the day holy even if you do some form of work?  If you mean that the Sabbath is to be kept by doing no work then even Jesus did not follow the will of God, for he healed people on the Sabbath considered by man to be work, and also allowed his disciples to pick grain on the Sabbath, and also asked if pulling your ox from the ditch would prevent you from keeping the Sabbath, so what ultimately are you asking because no man can truthfully judge another mans heart and tell him if he has or has not kept the Sabbath.

Read this story and decide for yourself what to make of it:    Luke 16: 19-31    "There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.    "The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'   "But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'   "He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'   "Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'   " 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'   "He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'

mrMkKFqNaa	You need to be completely accurate...otherwise you are a FALSE prophet.    See Deuteronomy 18:20-22: 20 However, the prophet who presumes to speak in my name a word that I have not commanded him to speak or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die. 21 And in case you should say in your heart: How shall we know the word that Jehovah has not spoken? 22 when the prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah and the word does not occur or come true, that is the word that Jehovah did not speak. With presumptuousness the prophet spoke it. You must not get frightened at him.    This is just another example of why the Watchtower/Jehovah's Witness religion is a false religion that is not approved by God.    The Watchtower/JW religion has falsely predicted the Battle of Armageddon on numerous occasions (1914, 1918, 1925, "within a generation of 1914").  According to the scripture quoted above--from the JW Bible, nonetheless--they are a false prophet...period...end of story.|`|t1LCnFV3aa	If you are not 100% accurate, then you are a false teacher.

Prophets do not "speak for God," God speaks through prophets. While this difference may seem subtle, it is not.    Isaiah 55:8-9    "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,         neither are your ways my ways,"         declares the LORD.    "As the heavens are higher than the earth,         so are my ways higher than your ways         and my thoughts than your thoughts.      ...and on a lighter note, Lizzy seems to be trapped in Wiki-land.

The believer is to serve as a witness or ambassador for Christ:    2 Corinthians 5:20 - Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.     Even the best students of the Bible involved with religion for many years, from the best seminaries cannot claim to speak for God, because we are continually learning new things every day and to make such a claim would be very, very dangerous, so the best thing I feel to do is when witnessing, one should do their very best to give a thorough and informative explanation of spiritual things, but always remind the person whom you are witnessing to that you are human and fallible and all spiritual conclusions and doctrines should be tested against the Word of God because that is how God speaks to mankind today and ultimately that is where truth is - in the Holy Bible, His words.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	Can't say it better than the Canadian Atheist...

If any doubt pray about it first and like one said the Lord knows your heart and will answer. The message God gives to his people to share is also one that builds up and not tear down, and if he gives a message of correction, it will be given in love and the person will receive it even if it hurts at first, I believe they will receive it and benefit from it.|`|C8gLsP3Taa	I would have to say it depends who your God or god is. There is so many cults now who have various gods and false teachings and whose prophecies never come true but all they ever do is make more lies and dig a deeper hole for themselves.

If you claim to speak for God, then there is no margin for error. If you're ever wrong, even once, then you are clearly not speaking for God and are a false prophet.    However, if you speculate and make it clear that it is your own opinion, then you are not a false prophet. According to Deuteronomy 18:20-22, a false prophet is one who presumes to speak in the name of God.     Therefore, if you DO make the claim to speak for God, then you HAVE to be 100% accurate all the time, just like the Bible!|`|zQyslfHKaa	Accuracy is the bane of all prophets.

czXaUPIlaa	The Buddha gave different medicines to cure different diseases. As a result, there are a great many Buddhist traditions - more than can be counted.    That's part of the beauty of Buddhism - it's not defined by dogma or creed. But it also can make it challenging to find a "home" where you can practice.    The truth is, it doesn't matter too much what kind of Buddhism you practice (some will disagree). Almost all Buddhist traditions and teachers carry forward the genuine essence of Buddhism - to practice without end and then attain enlightenment.    Three Buddhist traditions have become highly visible in the West: Insight meditation (Vipassana), Zen, and Tibetan Buddhism. In practice, Insight and Zen are similar to one another - they both involve paying close attention to the truth of the moment; through this process compassion arises. The Tibetan tradition, on the other hand, generally involves rich and detailed mind-practices that cultivate awareness and compassion.    If you naturally tend toward simple processes and activities, you might find yourself more at home in the Insight or Zen traditions. If your mind tends toward dreaming, visualization, and rich imagery, you will probably enjoy Tibetan Buddhism.    Of course, no matter which form of Buddhism you study, you will at some point become angry with it and want to reject it. This may come in the first year, or the 20th year. It's a natural process and a sign that the tradition's techniques are actually started to transform your life. So be patient with yourself!    Best wishes on your path!

NOTc1b9saa	This is almost an intuitive question!..Although most people probably wont believe this, nevertheless, it is true!    For a very long time we have lived in a society governed by fear and uncertainty, lack and limitation..Well, THAT is now going to come to an end because we are moving towards a new *Golden Age* in which we WILL HAVE more than enough money to be able to think about doing what we have ALWAYS wanted to do, but had instead to work at something just to earn money..    In the future, we can extend our life *horizon* from one of simply fighting to survive to perhaps beginning to use the natural abilities with which we were endowed, which was why God gave them to us in the first place..A new positive cycle of our lives is heading towards us and, to allow us to make full use of it, we need to let go our negativity and fear..We will be told more quite soon..    As those who have long controlled our society, known as the Illuminati, have used their corrupt banking and financial system to keep us short of money and thus personal power, currently we are seeing the beginning of the TOTAL implosion of that system so that a new banking system, waiting in the wings, can be introduced, a financial system BENEFICIAL to all people and not just the elite, as now..The bailouts will simply NOT work for the old way of doing things is now finished and cannot operate in the new energies coming to Earth..    There is a largely unseen battle going on behind to scenes, for those who govern us dont wish us to be free and thus deny them their power over us and resulting wealth..Revelations are close which will shock and horrify people, but we need to understand what has REALLY been going on..    Obama has come to begin to steer us back towards the Light..He is having to fight off the opposition in government and behind the scenes and, already, he has been protected from no less than 12 assassination attempts!    Our media are also controlled and mostly owned by the dark controllers also so we hear next to nothing about what is REALLY occurring, but not for much longer..We are heading into a truly amazing phase in our lives which, initially at least, wont be comfortable for many, BUT there will be direct help coming from a source that people wont believe and quite soon..God has not forgotten His/Her Children on Earth..Abundance is coming!    The *old house* is being demolished to make way for the new one!..Hang on in there!|`|81SiImlSaa	I would relax and enjoy my time with family and friends.

Somehow, I don't think that is what the Good God had in mind when He created us.  You may happen to live in a climate where going without heat and light, running water, etc., would not be so bad.  But where I live we have 6 months of winter, temperatures often falling to -20 to -30 F.  I assure you, going without heat in this environment would be more than an inconvenience.  You would have me spurn the very gifts God has given me.  Could you live without the seminary training you are receiving?  It was paid for by folks like me who work with our hands and support the Church by our giving.  I will not feel ashamed of the pleasures God has given.  Asceticism is not a measure of spiritual maturity, especially when it becomes a source of pride.    peace    My apologies.  I mistook you for another user with a similar name.  If you think you are living off the grid, you ought to wake up and smell the coffee.  The fact that you posted this question tells me otherwise.  As I said, I could survive without the infrastructure that supports me.  But a lot of others could not.  If you get seriously ill, won't you go to a hospital?  If not, you'll die.  God purpose for us is life.  Anything that enhances life is good.  I do not care about my possessions: clothes, toys, and so on.  I do care about food-- I've been hungry and I don't like it.  As I said, there is nothing inherently spiritual about your lifestyle.  Especially if you use it as a club to beat down other believers.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	I can't afford fashion designer clothes..I don't own a cell phone..

kO7xsy6xaa	It is not a matter what one thinks about God's punishment for sinners, but rather what the Bible say's. The ten generations of punishment is a man made doctrine. It also makes no sense.  We are all sinners, there is no one righteous no not one.  In order to be saved one has to repent, being baptized. Christ's shed blood keeps cleansing us. We must make every effort not to sin. We are saved by His grace, and not what we do. We also are instructed to worship Him every first day (Sunday) in spirit and in truth.    I strongly suggest some bible studies at a Christian church, not a sect or a cult, for what is written. If it is not written, I do not need it nor want it.  I am not shure but it might be the Mormons who have that kind of teaching. They are a kult. Ask questions and read it for yourself.  I am glad to guide you and help you.|`|nBPstkRBaa	If you think that the God is outside you, you will never be able to understand your question and most probably will never get an answer that will remove your confusion.

ttTDiJWfaa	Uh, not quite.    Book smarts and religious belief do NOT go hand in hand.    Conforming to religion is about placing the need to conforming to religious leaders rather than an acceptance of rationalism.    The emotional attachment the religious have to the religious who taught them that is so strong they will make any excuse that defies logic.

Pointing out a single scientist who converted is irrelevant - it is purely anecdotal, and ignores the much larger number of equally-qualified experts who disagree.    Pointing out the much higher numbers of atheist scientists is valid, as it shows the likelihood of intelligence and education in a relevant field leading to atheism.  It is fair to question it on the basis of correlation vs. causation, but not on the basis of appeal to authority.    As far as the peer-reviews - that's not an appeal to authority at all.  It simply shows that religion has provided NO evidence that can withstand scientific scrutiny.|`|peFtORvUaa	I claim wisdom,knowledge and understanding for christianity.

This is because in many cases, an atheist's beliefs would be constructed by a method called trail and error. An idea is a hypothesis. Continue using it until proven wrong. Correct hypothesis. Continue and repeat. Since atheist's dont have a governing body to correct what is right and wrong, we have the freedom to individually shape our beliefs. Since there is no authority to shape our hypothesis, we maintain a controlled set of beliefs if you wish.     The main reason many reject religion is because its human nature to strive for a more powerful position. Its like supporting a sports club or something. You would want your side to win.

HOW CAN ONE KNOW THEY DECIPHER THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS      1. Rev.2:7 and 22:14 [ after Genesis 3:22 ], whole bible to be in harmony.   2. Before anybody knows anything, the word of truth must be available at  end time, for whole world for those to be alive at Jesus 2nd coming   Matt. 24: 3,14, Rev.1:1-3,5; 3:12,14.    3. Real time is to Daniel at end of Judah Kings.  Then prophecy time summed up as:   WORLD HISTORY [ Babylon   3, to end of  7, 7x 360 = 2520 day years.  OR:    Rev.11:1-3, 12:6,14, 13:5 [ 2 times 1260 = 2520 God's time + 1260   man's time is WW1, Rev. 13:1-10, 11-18 [ 666 ], is WW2 [ for man's   wisdom as it is between prophecy time, a rise of a nation to power,    German Nation Hitler holocaust scene 1938 to 1945 horror ].   So Rev.17:10-14 continues, as the 8th is of the seven, Satan is down,   Jesus heavenly to organize in heaven, before his second coming.   4. Jesus ascended year 33, John  is near year 100, how long is   Jesus at God's right hand as to prophecy? John 3:13-15,   Matt.22:42-44, Acts 2:27-35, Heb.1:1-13, until enemies are down for   heavenly to be with Jesus as he prayed for this, John 17:1-26, as:  Rom.16:20, John 6:39,40,44, 14:3, 1Thes.4:15-17 to be raise up,   gathered or caught up to be with Jesus at his 2nd coming.   5. Enemies [ antichrist ], is Satan and unholy angels, Michael,   Dan.12:1-9, 10-13, the time of the end, Rev.12:3,4,6-7-12, gives   enemies short time underfeet of holy [ 2300, 2500, 2520, 2580, have   passed, 2009 CE is 2615].   6. Real time 3460 [ 606 BCE ] + prophecy time.  Now at 2009 CE is 2615 years ago, and Satan's short time with Michael   in the time of the end means from end of Judah kings and real time,   there is no king until king Jesus at his 2nd coming.  Rev.9:1-5 [ 5x 30 = ] 150, Pit open for Satan, God's sealed are there.   TRIBULATIONS WW1 + ?   Rev.9:12-16 [ Euphrates angels, Iraq, Rev.16:12-16 ]:  Satan is down, Matt.24:3,7,14,15,21,36 [ God alone knows the day and  the hour ], all other time is given, if Satan from Eden and man born dying,   has 6130 years to Rev.20:1-6,12,13, no Satan 1000 years, while Jesus   make all alive for a new heaven and a new earth as it was before Eden,   God knows only day and hour, 1Thes.5:1-9,21,22; God does not leave   any truth seeker in the dark.   Rev.7:9-17 [ summed up is tribulation survivors ], to see   1Cor.15:22-28,51-53 & know the firstfruits are coming with Jesus to  save all possible back to Abel in the 1000 year reign of Jesus and his.   7. Rev.17:10-14 continues, Rev.11:15,18, Matt:25:31-34, Dan.12:1-12,13  continues as Dan.12: 1-12 [ 2x 1335 = 2670, it is 2615 at 2009 CE ],   WW1 &   7 2520 to 2524, have passed, WW2 2544 to 2551 [ how much   fire fell from heaven? ], ended 64 years ago, as World History conflict,   2580 was 35 years ago, Dan.12:1-11 [ 2x 1290 = 2580 = the end of a   world conflict in 1974 ], what does Satan own, Matt.4:1-11, Satan is god   of this world, 2Cor.4:3,4, that ends.   Daniel the four gospels, the apostles and revelations involved.  Matt.24:3 [ world ends ], 7 [ after major wars ], 14 [ after 2nd coming of   Jesus is made know ], 15 [ after time of the end with Michael to 1Thes.4:  15-17 ], 21 [ after tribulation ], 36 [ of the 6130 years from Eden for Satan,  God alone knows the day and the hour to Rev.20: 1-6, no Satan 1000 years.|`|Wt398Yueaa	It's like the Rorschach ink blot test.

There MUST also be a thourough study of Daniel, Ezekiel, and also parts of Matthew and Luke, to gain a clearer understanding of the prophecy of Revelation. It is a book about the church (the bride of Christ), the Gentiles that are left behind after the "rapture" (a word describing the next prophetic event on the prophetic calender), and the nation of Israel, God's chosen people according to the promises given to Abraham. It will take a lot of study, but there are many sites to go to for help, and besides this, the book itself promises a blessing to all those who read it.

If a "ghost" showed up in front of me, and let me photograph/video tape it, and it showed up on the recordings just how I saw it, that would be interesting and would make me think hard and investigate.  That would be "evidence."  Otherwise...no.    Peace.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	I doubt I'd accept the whole religious spiel based on a single ghost.    But a verifiable, repeatable, valid instance of a ghost would certainly open up the probability that there was a whole new world, unknown to physics. I'd be tremendously excited, and would be inclined to devote the rest of my life to studying it - using the $1M I'd get from the JRF to fund my work toward my Nobel!|`|9m2LvlWdaa	No, it would make me question my sanity.|`|zkETPA8waa	No, because belief in the supernatural does not hinge on Christianity. It would need to be something specific to Christianity (ie visitiation by an angel or something like that) to convince me that the Christian deity existed.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Not really, that would be a hallucination.  If several thousand people saw the same thing and it was imaged and captured then we're getting somewhere.|`|KT7cllsLaa	If anything youve described happen to me  id go and get consultation with my shrink.  Srsly|`|7sEFufRbaa	To say that everything there is to know has already been learned would be foolish. To say that man knows everything would be foolish. However, atheists know everything and if they say something doesn't exist, ghosts, spirits, afterlife, God, etc etc etc well then they must be right or Fools.....|`|LLey4VRzaa	God said there is no such things as ghost; and the devil, demons, and anything evil...is Man. The Bible says this!    If they are talking about God that means they believe in Him. No Body Talks about things they don't believe in, NO ONE!|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Romans 1:18-32 says people do not believe because of moral issues - not because a lack of evidence.|`|EepiLrmZaa	zero chance of that .|`|AA11709855	I believe medication... is needed.|`|8DRzJEfpaa	As a kid I sat around, reading a book in the living room.    I heard my Terrier rustling in its Sleeping Basket.     I turned to look at Britta (name of the dog).    She came trotting towards me.    I whistled and tried to coax her to me, but the dog ignored me so I continued to read my book.    I then got up about 10 Min. later to get myself a glass of Soda and reminisced about my beloved Britta.    ...which died 2 Years ago...!    Did that change my mind about god?     Not in the slightest.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	I already believe in ghosts and it does not make me think that god exists.  I don't see the connection between the two.|`|AA10873763	Been there, actually.  Still a non-believer.  What we call "supernatural" are simply things that we don't yet understand.  Once upon a time volcanoes and eclipses were supernatural events.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Um the concept of ghosts contradicts the concept of heaven.    That just means I would believe in ghosts not God. Even still I might not believe in ghosts. I might make a logical explanation for it.|`|37LKDbtsaa	I would see my doctor about hallucinations.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	No, I have had a lucid dream before now.
iOo9MAxJaa	No where does it say to kill anyone over such a thing in the Quran!  Muslims just wish that their prophet is respected.  Muhammad was the perfect example. He never reacted harshly when someone did something wrong. He got harassed by others, but he did not retaliate or cause them any harm.  Today's Muslims should remember how their Prophet used to act.    ---  Apart from freedom of speech, there is a thing called respect.  Why make drawings mocking a belief?! I think that's very unintelligent.|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	I have read the Quran (Koran) twice and it does not say this.  But..  there is a long history of Islamic religious leaders interpreting the Quran and making "religious law".    It is the work of these men that pushes some to this extreme.    Much of the Quran is sensible and peaceful even saying in some places that Muslims should try to get along with non-believers (who don't take their property).    I recommend reading the Quran.  It is not too long and broken into nice short chapters.  It is a much easier read than the Bible.|`|HiyZVnozaa	Good point.    That's the reason sometimes I feel Islam is a killing cult in the name of a religion. The Muslims could prove me wrong though (by refraining from killings for no reason).    The truth is that the Quran is definitely very violent if you take it literally (that's what the extremists do). It takes a lot of overlooking to make it appear moderate.|`|8e24cf4870f7acf4b978a06e284a53a8aa	I assume you are referring to the cartoon drawing done in Denmark ( I think ) awhile ago?    It may not be the Holy Prophet, nor could it be the general Muslims at fault, it could be the individual Imams that could have misinterpretted what was written and mislead people into violence and murder...    Coz if interpretations are cohesive and standard... the Sunnis and Shiates wouldnt be shooting at each other over philosophical differences of the same Holy Texts.|`|7Bj4AAo8aa	It is illegal to kill someone if they haven't attacked us(in our lands) first.    "if any one slew a person - unless it be (legal retaliation) for murder or for (stopping the spreading) corruption in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people... " (Glorious Quran 5:32)    Btw, we get outraged when people mock Jesus the Messiah(pbuh) aswell.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I don't understand why there were so many protests over it and some of the banners they hand were far worse than the cartoon.  Some said behead those who insult Islam.      But it's like when the Pope said something about Mohammed, there were more protests and banners saying awful things about non-Muslims again.  And the Catholic Nun Sister Leonella in Somalia was shot and killed.  And also the threats the Pope received were worse than what he said.    A day before Christmas some Muslims put stickers everywhere saying Jesus was a Muslim in a town in the UK.  That is offensive to us so isn't that double standards?    I'm not stupid I know most Muslims are not like that and are respectful and we shouldn't disrespect them but when somebody does disrespect them the ones who have a tendency to protest with awful banners should learn to forgive and forget.  And not be hypocrites by having placards deliberately and viscously insulting non-Muslims.    I think people have a right to protest but there has to be a line drawn somewhere.    Shiaislam- so a prophet and imam can kill non-believers if they want?  And you can kill if somebody is trying to get a Muslim to convert to a different religion?  Does that not sound wrong?|`|ltu3iKJYaa	no listen to me. We muslims don't just go kill people who mack the prophet and make fun of him. Only if the person is trying to kill you or is going to kill a believer and he is a non believer. Also no one is allowed to kill a non-believr for know reason accept if ur a prophet or imam. or u have to get permission from one of them. We dont kill for no reason. We kill people who r trying to confuse others and send them on the wrong path. We just try to get ppl to do good things in life and follow the 5 pillars of islam
C1SOqQSkaa	It's the reason *and* the definition.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	That is the core reason.    Atheism is, at it's heart, a statement about how one perceives reality as it is, not as one may wish it to be. Whatever emotional or intellectual consolations this brings with it are secondary.|`|GGUDvicaaa	To me, yes.|`|AA10556726	The only defining thing about atheism is lack of belief in gods.  Nothing more, nothing less.  You are not an atheist for any other reason than a lack of belief.    Individuals may have varied reasons why they have no belief, but the only thing that makes a atheist is the lack of belief.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Romans 1:18-32 says it is a moral issue with atheists, not a lack of evidence for God.|`|v80N4JB0aa	Everything is nature, there is no silly supernatural realm or occult beings,  that is just for crazy people|`|ybFg4umCaa	It's better than associating with christians|`|AA12301710	what is the natural cause for rape?  What is the natural cause for a man raping a 1 year old?   What is the natural cause or natural benefit for Homosexuality?|`|oVHFz52Laa	No, the only reason is that they do not have Holy Spirit of God to guide them so they do not know Him|`|HiyZVnozaa	Actually atheists are genuine seekers of truth.    But they look for truth in the wrong place and hence can't find it.    "Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?" (Matt. 7:16)|`|KT7cllsLaa	Reason for being an atheist is  )in my case)  Lack of belief in anything supernatural  I agree with you..  we might not have answers to everything yet, but, scientists around the globe work on it for close to 200 years and look at the progress since.|`|kLPOFIOpaa	We don't choose to be atheist because we think it's logical, we believe in nothing because we haven't been convinced otherwise.|`|315d08ffe32ebab370b799724d5f19a6aa	Even if there is a creator he plays no role in our daily life.He cannot grant our wishes His existence is based on belief not on scientific proof. He exists in people's mind not in reality. Belief in God is just a figment of our imagination.|`|FB7QVMzQaa	It's because I "do not have the Holy Spirit of God to guide me"... *rolls eyes*..... *shakes head*......    Yes, not believing there is a god/supernatural creator defines what an atheist is, yet there are a vast array of other things that they might believe.|`|urIm4YaBaa	The lack of evidence is the only reason.  You don't need a natural explanation for anything to be an Atheist.
3ZgOAUOTaa	no... those unplugged from the matrix know that it exists and choose to remain separate.    an atheist does not believe in a god|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	No most are pop cultured idiots who threw the baby out with the bath water.  The ones Ive known just replace God with some other figure or ideology, like Marxism, Liberalism, etc etc.  They do this w/o knowledge of the Matrix that they support.  Fundamentalists are just as bad or worse.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTahZE4q9...    Edit:  I assumed you were referring to the NWO as the Matrix, if you were referring to a belief in God then youre obviously biased and see only the negative aspects of religion whereas I have seen the good side, whether or not God exists, what moral figure is any finite human soul to tell me what I should and should not believe.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Only if the Matrix was designed by shoddy programmers who wrote code with a tendency to crash and return a variety of error messages.|`|C8SJmlHJaa	Silly rabbit, trix are for kids!|`|MdyHKQRGaa	And I assume Jesus is Agent Smith in your analogy?|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Actually, the Matrix was written the other way around. The matrix was supposed to be the wool pulled over the eyes of the unbelieving world by the Devil (machine) and the ones who rejected the matrix were the Christians who followed the One (Neo), a man born inside, whose name means 'new' and who would lead us all out of the lies and into the truth. This is why his girlfriend was named "Trinity", an oracle foretold his coming, and he was betrayed by Cypher (Judas). Notice that at the end of the movie after he died and came back he came into full power and defeated the agent of evil (Smith). They made this metaphor obvious when that character said to Neo, "You're my savior, my own personal Jesus Christ."
jbDTsZyBaa	Didn't you know that asking about equality for whites is 'racist' and highly offensive to some people? Denial of white privilege is even worse.

If the only questions you're getting are  "Why do white people like being punks?" I wouldn't complain. Questions about blacks are usually really idiotic or cruel. I haven't seen many questions bashing white people on here. Probably because most people are white.     And what is this about equality for whites lol?|`|jTFdG8xqaa	Um...i would say someone flagged your question as offensive and it was taken down.

sRvfF732aa	A few days ago I was going to get in my minivan, and I slipped. The ice was sorta sloped towards the van so when I fell flat on my back I kinda slipped halfways under the van.  Then I grabbed the door handle to help me get up because it was SO slippery and the door popped open and hit me in the head.  My neighbours across the street saw and they were first like "omg are you ok?" but I was laughing at myself then they started laughing.  I told some friends about it and they all find it hilarious, it's a classic "me" moment, I am a bit clumsy, lol|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...

XqpRYh52aa	What's he in for?|`|AA10096992	That's exactly why I avoid prison.|`|eloWO2piaa	...because Christians are really the evil ones that use God as an excuse to commit and get away with dirty crimes.

The prisons are not full of Athiests because when people commit a crime and go to prison they find God.

Atheist also have a lower divorce rate.    Possible reasons...    1) Many convert in prison due to social pressure and excessive guilt etc.    2) Atheists tend to be more educated and don't do as much crime.    3) Desperate people do more crime and this desperation also drives people to find religion.    4) People who have problems with their ability to empathize need religion to guide their behavior.  They have a broken moral compass so they tend to both find god and do crime.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	I think it's a great reason to stay away from prison, just to not be locked in 24/7 with a nutter.|`|zkETPA8waa	The polls are done on entrance, so a surprising number of prisoners must be converting pretty damn quickly for that to be the case.

PXMqXwflaa	I'm certain there is a hell. I have an ex wife.|`|ykImIiTwaa	God eventually saves all of us from sin and punishment and shares His complete happy experience of eternity with everyone...      God reconciles all to Himself through Jesus Christ, Who makes peace through His shed blood and crucifixion (Col 1:20). Jesus is the Lamb of God Who takes away all the sins of all the world (Jn 1:29). The creation itself, also, shall be freed from the slavery of corruption into the glorious freedom of the children of God (Rom 8:21).    Hell's punishment is not forever but until the end of the eons - eonian punishment. People don't sin enough during their mortal lives for God to choose endless punishment besides it would spoil the future of eternity to have a section continually reserved for endless torture...    People are made by God to rebel against His ideal will for them and then offered a choice - forgiveness of their rebellion, or, punishment for their sins until they have paid the last 'penny'... After punishment, those who went through torture in hell come to realise they need faith on God to succeed in life and they are converted into God's kingdom so that they cease from sinning and are rewarded for their compliance...      There are two bible translations which uphold the doctrine of Universal Reconciliation with God, and the union of all beings into experience of God as the all in each of us.

Gc49JgoQaa	Meditation is the lowering of brain activity and/or brain waves. It is useful for relaxing, relieving stress and tension. You can apply it by sitting still with your eyes closed and breathing deeply, while focusing (within your mind/imagination) on either; empty thoughts, a clear mind, visual imagery, beautiful scenery, a single concept or some background music.|`|t3W4h59haa	Meditation is viagra for hippies.|`|rDcfw1Q8aa	Meditation is kind of the brain equivalent of eating lots of prunes/taking a laxative. Where as a laxative flushes the body of waste and toxins, meditation flushes the mind of the irrelevant day to day nonsense that gets stuck in your brain.    People do it naturally. Ever found yourself just staring into space thinking about nothing? That's a crude form of meditation, usually a sign you need to rest.    The simplest method, I find, is to sit or lie somewhere comfortable, and then to concentrate on the colour Red, until all I'm thinking about is that colour. I then slowly move up the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Blue, Indigo, etc).     By the time I reach violet  I've reached a point where I'm calm and relaxed, and able to face the day rationally.|`|8nvktlqTaa	Meditation is  a state of being in which not you but your shadow is in charge of your thoughts your actions you movements your morality and basically every other thing now this shadow coulde be affected by a positive and helpfull idea in that state of subconsciousness and puch you life forward in a better way or it can also be harmfull if used in a wrong way but i don't think if it is farmfull most of the times but the peacfulness that you gain any way while medidaiting it'll take you to where you belong that is why it makes sense even from a religios point of view specally that in religions meditation is always acompanied with praying i though a lot about this and this what this is lol hopfully  helpfull now please give me my ten points if you don't mind|`|G9VBTg47aa	You wont get any good answers from a lot of these CLOWNS who just spread HATE in here, but check out this site http://ie.youtube.com/user/yogameditatio...|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	keeping my mind fixed on my god instead of myself   sitting somewhere in quite reflection  it helps me to still myself and forget about the worries of the world for a time|`|6SlBdQZ8aa	submit your will to god|`|AA11709855	It's where you say... uhmmm, uhmmm... for a moment.|`|NjPjpewlaa	Because I am a christian, meditation for me, is getting in my quiet spot, with nothing else happening, and closing my eyes, and talking and listening, and contemplating God.
NjPjpewlaa	Yes, I can paint a picture - heaven is beautiful, filled with sights and sounds and smells all so beautiful we haven't even seen them yet.  We have never seen such beauty, and deep colours.  There is such intense joy, such a joy that cannot be bought, this world has no clue about it.  There is no night, you don't sleep, and it is as bright as the noon sun... only the brightness comes from the heart and the love of our King Jesus.    and those who have loved Him, and endured to the end, will be there.|`|UDo55SKUaa	Quite boring.    Why else would I come back here?|`|MED20HbPaa	Different. I think that if there is a heaven, and it indeed exists outside of our three dimensional existence, then it's going to be a like a cartoon on TV suddenly becoming real.     In my experience reading the four Gospels, Jesus speaks about it with infuriatingly little details. It reminds me of how my parents were when they were giving me a Christmas present they knew I would like. I'd ask, "What am I getting?" and they would say something like, "It's great *laugh*, you'll find out soon!"|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Kirby (pink cartoon character) went into the supermarket, ate 1,000 rolls of toilet paper and then spewed it out all over the place.

ux27QjGHaa	Yes, every other country has the 4th of July. No other country celebrates it though...nice try :)|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	No - it is the celebration of the USA becoming an independent United States.    It would not apply to other Countries at all.|`|w68p19bNaa	Every country that follows a calendar that uses the month name "July" has a 4th of July. Places that don't use "July" have their own versions of the date. In Japan, for instance, it would be yon-no-shichi-gatsu.     That said, not every country celebrates an Independence Day, partly because not every country is independent. The indigenous people of Myanmar, for instance, don't celebrate independece for that reason - they're actively under repression and have nothing to celebrate. The French have Bastille Day, which is similar to the USA's Independence Day. Mexico has an Independence Day they celebrate. Several other countries have their own respective dates they celebrate the emancipation of their nation, but none are - to my knowledge - on the 4th of July.|`|143bm6cnaa	Yes, all countries have a 4th of July on their calendar, but they do not celebrate American Independence Day.|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	We have Canada Day on July 1 here|`|DGJZxoJdaa	Wow you're serious?...That wasn't funny you just made yourself look dumb.

If you mean, "Can you DO anything you want?", that too, can be subdivided into categories.    I can become a great painter, but I can not become a painting.      I can do anything that is not a sin, nor creates a logical contradiction (such as when people ask, "Can God create a rock too big for Him to move?", which is illogical).    I can not do anything that will harm myself or others.    I CAN (if I'm not mistaken) visit other planets and galaxies.  But I can not become a galaxy.    So, in answer to your question, "Can you become ANY thing you want in heaven?"

Worshiping the mother and child has been around for a very very long time. In fact, if you read Ezekial, there is a part where the Israelites got in big trouble for "baking cakes to the queen of heaven". Gee, where have I heard that title before? Catholics gave Mary the same name as an ancient Babylonian deity that Israel was punished for praying to. Hm. Interesting, no?|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Mary is the New Eve and the Mother of Jesus (our savior).  Through one woman's disobedience to God, sin and death came into the world. Likewise through one woman's obedience to God, came life and the hope of salvation.  Elijah is in no way lowered by Mary's glory and honor, if that is what you are getting at.  Certainly, he too honors and loves her just as though she is HIS mother.  Mary was the mother of Jesus, and Jesus is our brother, because he made us his brothers and sisters (Matthew 12:49), therefore, she too is our mother in heaven as well as Elijah's.    What do you suppose our Lord meant when he said to the disciple: "Behold, your mother!" Didn't the disciple take her into his home from then on? (John 19:27)    It stands to reason then, that Mary is the greatest of all the Saints.  Do you dishonor your mother by placing yourself over her?  Do you elevate yourself to be greater than your own mother?  Not if you keep the commandments!  So then why would we elevate Elijah who is our brother to be an equal to Mary, or greater than Mary?  Did Jesus come into the world through Elijah?  Of course not!  Elijah was a man.  It was a woman who carried our Lord in her womb, and it is her that is given honor and respect, because we are commanded by our Lord to "Honor our Father and Mother" (Exodus 20:12, Matthew 15:4)    Therefore, Elijah does not hold the same status, however, he certainly is great among the Saints!|`|AA12346187	why do they not put Jesus before mary is more to  the point.|`|IIhiSprlaa	Where's Elijah now, cutieboo?|`|AA11066202	We all believe a lot but we know sweet bugger all.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Short answer:  Elijah never used his body to give flesh to a deity and push Him out of his body during childbirth.|`|URO3gDXcaa	never died?  really?  where is he living now?  got any proof?|`|2CBxqNcaaa	Elijah is one of the witnesses that will return.

The reason for Hail Mary is because as it turns out Elijah didn't pop Jesus out of his womb and wasn't proclaimed by an angel to be "full of grace"|`|o9cAl8xhaa	Because Mary is the mother of God.

But Jews tend to consider Elijah a very important prophet indeed because he was taken up into heaven and did not die.  Similarly, in Islam, where I believe he is known as Hijra, he is quite significant.  He brought a dead child back to life as well, as I recall, so in a way he prefigures Christ in the Old Testament.    But if you want to know why is not venerated in the Catholic Church, that I can't say.  I thought he was!
N9VN9bwfaa	The old Roman religion was clearly inadequate for an empire, in case you're actually interested in an answer.  Unlike the Greeks, the Romans did not have many stories or great gods.  The Romans gave the names of their own deities to a lot of Greek deities and borrowed all the good Greek stories, to start off with.  So a lot of us know stories like how Zeus gave birth to Athena out the top of his head after he swallowed his sweetie pie in the form of a fly, so she wouldn't outsmart him.  Well, the Roman version just has Jupiter swallowing the same fly and having Minerva jump out the top of her daddy's skull.    But by the time the Romans had conquered the rim of the whole Mediterranean, they were beginning to lose patience with that kind of story.  As one wag put it, if the gods were so great and powerful, couldn't they write their intentions in a more obvious location than some sheep's liver or a cow's intestines?  That's because previously the priests would sacrifice a calf or a lamb to some god and then cut it open and inspect the innards to predict the future of some endeavor.  If the liver had spots on it or the intestines looked a little iffy, then the proposed war (or lawsuit or marriage or whatever) was off.  The gods must be objecting!    As I said, the Romans were losing patience with that sort of thing.  They figured if they could rule over all those various lands on earth, some deity ought to be ruling over all those lands in heaven too.  Makes sense, doesn't it?  So by the time of Christ, they were ready for a change.  A lot of religions were competing with early Christianity, though.  There was Mithras, a fellow who had deep roots in Persia and was very popular among the Roman legion.  There was the Unconquered Sun, who was the one whose birthday started out around the time when we now celebrate Christmas.  There was the Magna Mater (or Great Mother) who came from Anatolia (where Turkey is now) who had a young lover who died and came back to life (well, sort of -- he only came back to life as some vegetation).    All of these characters and others had converts in Rome and elsewhere in the Roman Empire, alongside early Christianity.  Isis, with her son Horus was another very popular one.  So was the infamous Diana of Ephesus.  So was that Tammuz character for whom all those ladies were weeping in Jerusalem who got some of the Old Testament prophets all worked up from Isaiah to Jeremiah.  These were particularly long-lived.  Their followers continued to compete with Christianity for as much as 400 years Anno Domini.    It was Emperor Constantine who made the final decision to make Christianity the religion of his latter-day Roman Empire that struck the final blow against paganism, my dear, not God.  Constantine was not a Christian himself.  His wife was.  He thought it would be good politics and only converted on his deathbed.  This is all ancient history.    But throughout history, there have always been dissenters.  One of the great things about early Christianity was that it said everyone had a place in the great scheme of things, even the poor, even the slaves.  It was the poor, the slaves, and especially the women who made up the majority of the early converts.  These people had no secure future in Rome or anywhere else.  They were desperate for something.  And in Christianity they found something they needed.  Buddhism had much the same appeal in the East.|`|baW9sSsLaa	*sigh*    We've never argued your god didn't exist.  Just His claim of being the "One, True God."    And look at the Christian festivals.  Compare them to the pagan festivals.  A lot of what we do looks an awful lot like what you do, because on of the earliest tactics was to "adapt" pagan festivals to the Christian mythos.    "Hey, you celebrate the birth of the Sun on the winter solstice?  What do you know, we celebrate the birth of the Son!  And rebirth in the spring?  Hey, what do you know, so do we!"    And a generous dose of fear (do it our way or face ETERNAL PUNISHMENT!) and it was often just easier for pagans to convert rather than to resist the pressure.|`|s5xOMGcbaa	Just because you can get people to believe you does not mean you are correct.

I mean, look at Islam in the last ten years it has grown exponentially in some parts of the world.

YQOT68xFaa	Jesus was Jewish. He was the One who Christians follow; He had no denomination.    And the church He founded? Not the LDS, not the Roman Catholic Church. It was not an organized religion. Churches were individual bodies of believers in different towns and countries. They didn't have a heirarchy or one particular leader that they took directions from - they all followed Jesus instead. They shared around their copies of Paul's letters and other sections of Scripture but they were not an organized "official religion". And today the church is still in existence.

He was born to a Jewish mother, he went to the synagogues for his teachings. His disciples, colleagues, associates were all Jews.  Jesus will return for His Church one day. He wont be going around knocking on only the Baptist church doors, or the Methodist, or the Church of Christ, or the Catholic. He wont look to see who is in attendance, who is on the membership role, and from that start calling them onto His cloud. He will return and take all those who are members of his Church, the Body of Christ, back with Him to Heaven. What makes you a part of the Body of Christ? Having the Holy Spirit within you, which is given when you became a believer (Ephesians 1:13).|`|KlXUrxBfaa	Anointed !|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Obviously a Jew, and more obviously a Christian.

Jesus could NOT be a Christian, because that would contradict who He is.  God.  Just think for a minute.  The word Christian means "Christ-like."  So uhmm, if Jesus is 'already'  Christ, then...  how can He be like Himself?  See how silly that is.  Doesn't that make sense?      WE ...believers, followers, disciples of Jesus are to be.. "Christ"-like = Christians.  Those who profess to be Christians are to demonstrate who they are "in" Christ by their lifestyle, which should ressemble, Jesus; the Fruit of the Spirit.

All I'm saying is that I think that Christ organized a church during biblical times--and that I think the church He made, back then, would have to be the true church.  So then I ask, is that church among us still?    EDIT:  You're right, I believe some Catholics probably would, as well as a host of other denominations.  My only point is that there was obviously a church founded by Christ anciently--and being such, that church would have to be the "true" church.  I guess to each his own in determining which church is that from the Bible.  It's up to us to study that out and decide appropriately.    EDIT:  Obviously, not all of us are right.

vSomavIzaa	To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee (religious leader) and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other menrobbers, evildoers, adulterersor even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'    "But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'   "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."    -Luke 18: 9-14|`|G9VBTg47aa	Are you what they label a "TROLL?"|`|Gsd4VD13aa	Its bullshit.

Ignore Jimbo, that was totally uncalled for. Well, as Muslims, we do believe strongly that our religion is right, but we shouldn't go around preaching and disrespecting people's beliefs, or telling people that they're going to hell, because its haram (forbidden). Its a fundamental belief in Islam that there is no compulsion in religion, so yes to each their own. Yes, there are some Muslims who do act horribly, which is probably why you're asking because maybe you've heard of Muslims behaving intolerantly, but we don't condone any act like that, especially just because they follow a different religion. Its shameful and disgraceful that Muslims hurt other people because they disagree with their own beliefs, but Muslims who understand the true teachings of Islam should not in any way hurt anyone or be disrespectful to anyone because hes non-Muslim. In a religious conversation, well yeah you have to be open minded and listen to each other or else you'll get nowhere. Christians and Muslims usually have debates together, and its respectful, they're both polite to each other. No ones trying to tell each other that they'll be burning in hell, or that they should convert, just trying to understand what both believe in. In the end, they both acknowledge that all Jews, Christians and Muslims believe in the same God. You'll find ignorant Muslims around unfortunately, but they need to look back to the Qur'an and understand Islam's true message. I hope all Christians, Jews, Atheists, and whoever understand that we Muslims aren't ALL intolerant, crazy, war mongering people. We want to get along with them too, thats what Islam teaches us.

8gveZWbHaa	1.  No morality is not eternal, universal or some kind of ultimate "Form of Good"    2.  No god, therefore no mind of god    EDIT: you said  "I did not ask if the Form of Good exists, but that if it did exist outside and alongside of God, what would that mean as a consequence."    Actually, I did answer the question: Yes, morality does exist outside of any deity, and no it's not eternal.    Your question assumes a god exists, for which there is no evidence.    But if you want to speculate, then a god's role in your scenario, it seems, is the eternal policeman: not the legislator but the judge and punisher.  But it would also imply that this god should also be bound by this "eternal good" thing you've envisaged.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Some people don't need rules, others feel they do. Ok? And no, I haven't read the whole thing... too tired for that.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	You make a lot of hidden assumptions, and many are wrong.    Morality is independent of God, but is not universal. It's specific to the species of animal involved.     A leopard is a lone predator. Its morality considers another leopard to be the worst thing in the world, except if it's mating season and the other is a female.     A meerkat is a social animal. Its morality wants to be friendly and kind to other meerkats, and if necessary altruistic to them - because doing so confers an advantage on it.    Humans are social animals too. They are nice to each other because, like meerkats, their society would sunder if they were not. This can be demonstrated mathematically and by observation.|`|b2bMy1EAaa	Morality has nothing to do with religion of any kind...........    The USA is the most religious western country and most Christian country(80% claim to be Christian)which is amusing because it has the highest crime rates, one of the lowest education rates(for western countries)and has one of the highest poverty rates(for western countries again). Also look at its wars in recent history and its intolerance to certain groups and people(gay, abortion etc).     Then on the other hand you have Sweden the most atheist country(85%)and its the exact opposite. One of the best welfare systems, lowest crime rates, one of the highest educated nations in the world and is extremely tolerant(although Scandanavia does have some of the highest suicide rates which is attributed to climate/lack of light etc not religion before you start harping on). When did you last see the Swedes invading a country controversially?     What does that say about religion, morals and quality of life?    All of what I said above is factual and is supported by evidence from all over the place, it isn't atheist propaganda at all. You can check it all out for yourself :)    Sorry for not directly answering your questions :)|`|Xcri5qeTaa	1. If morality is independent of or outside of God (e.g. in the Form of Good), then is it eternal, and if so, does that mean God is not the ultimate First Cause?    1a. Morality is defined by the living.    2. If morality exists inside the mind of God and is therefore expressed in his commands, then does that mean God cannot command arbitrarily? If so, does that mean God is limited, and therefore not omnipotent? (Or how do you define omnipotent to avoid the contradiction?)    2a. Just because you can doesn't mean you should.    3. If Gods commands must relay either the Form of Good existing outside him (if you accept that view), or conform to his own nature (if you accept that view as an alternative), does that mean any commands alleged to be from God that reason reveals to be immoral are not from God?    3a. If God can/will only be moral and good, then immoral or bad commands cannot come from God. However, if immoral/bad commands come from God, then God is not entirely moral and good.    4. If reason reveals that murdering innocent children and women is immoral, then does that mean that the Canaanite Genocide that the Bible records was a command from God is immoral and therefore not from God, showing that the author was flawed theologically?    4a. I believe so, but the argument for ultimate good beyond the incident is likely to come up here.    5. If you counter to number 4 that the act of murdering innocent children and women is not immoral if God commands it, then is it immoral for me to kill myself, even though I hear God speaking to me and telling me to do so?    5a. You should get a second opinion, and be skeptical of commands which would cause harm to yourself or others.    6. If you counter to 5 that I am crazy, on what basis do you make that assumption, and in what way is that assumption different from those that some unbelievers make about some biblical authors?    6a. Likely to be called delusional, but the difference is those who don't believe think it's delusional to believe any voice is that of god, and believers think it's delusional or demonic influence to believe a moral god would command you to kill yourself.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Morality is an individual issue while all gods are non-existent.|`|tePg8kO4aa	Your problem is that you need these questions answered with in the context of their being a personal god.    Unless you take God out of the equation, your questions will always be offensive to your belief. Maybe god isn't real though, and maybe he has nothing to do with human life. There is more than one way of thinking and I suggest you take a look.|`|Lc8hkjHPaa	1. Yes, it means God is not the ultimate First Cause. Any rational and independent thinker can figure this out. Morality is simply a code of logical behaviour learned throughout life.    2. Can God create a rock that he himself cannot lift?    3. Allegations are a nasty thing. Many logically immoral events in the name of God are usually discredited or the facts/reasons bent by believers.    4. see 3    5. If you are a true Christian, you will know that God doesn't speak to believers anymore. That's an Old Testament thing. Christians will say that any voices heard in our time is the work of the devil. I say it's just craziness. You're somehow unhappy with your life, but you need to work that out for yourself.    6. Biblical authors supposedly heard voices in their heads. They then told others what they heard, and the masses of other believed them. This is the basis of all Christianity - a large group of people taking the word of one man and turning it into the word of God.|`|DXXpHKupaa	1. This has always been one of my chief problems with traditional Theism.  It led me to Pantheism via Taoism.  I believe that God is a non-personal, omnipresent, non-judging entity, present all around us and within us.  God=Dao in my eyes.  Morality is an invention of Man.  In Sparta, it was required to beat your slaves.  Was this moral?  For the Aztecs, human sacrifice to the sun god was needed to keep him strong.  Was this moral?    2.  This is an interesting question and I'm glad you asked it.  Once again, you'll find that God's (or god's, depending on the respective religion) commands of morality ironically do not seem to hold him back from ordering others to break them (an allusion to  3 and  4), making God a hypocrite.  One must also ask why God would command humans to perform acts God would have easily been able to do (being omnipotent).      3. This is where traditional Theism and Pantheism go their separate ways.      A. The first view indicates that God created Morality outside of him-however, at times, God has others commit acts against this very morality in countless instances.  Did God create Morality as an imperfect, tangible system?  It has always been my belief that Morality is just that, tangible and unknown.  While I strive for common morality (don't kill, lie, steal ect.) because I'm a Pantheist, others do not.  Any act against morality would not be an act against God, as God would not equal morality-being a separate aspect outside of God.    B. The second view is that Morality is the nature of God, then perhaps the Ten Commandments are misread or mistranslated.  As a Pantheist, I believe that Morality is a human invention-devoid of any higher power, but a necessary invention for the continuity of society.  The rules of the Bible have undergone many changes and different parts have been emphasized at different times that always seem to go in line with the culture that implements them.  Exodus 22:18 says "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."  This is the only case in which any orders about witches are given, yet this one passage was used throughout history to persecute "witches".  Today, this passage is glazed over by modern Christians, yet some still yell hellfire about movies like Harry Potter.  1 Corinthians 14:34-36 says "Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. " is also no longer held by the Church except among the most fundamentalist of branches.  Morality, as you can see, even in regards to the Bible, changes from time to place-and so do we.  So, this is why morality is an invention of man, not God.    4. Ancient times were hard living.  Wholesale slaughter of opposing peoples was the norm and even applauded in those times.  In our times our reason has concluded that these acts were immoral.  So did they misinterpret God?  Did they make up the entire "God told us to" excuse?  Did Satan tell them to, disguised as God?  I'm opt to think the answer is that they made it up, and if they didn't, why would anyone follow such a God?    5. The murdering of innocent women and children is immoral in my opinion and almost everyone elses.  The real question is "Can we even hear the commands of God?"  No.  Not in my reasoning anyway.  As a Pantheist, I've discarded the notion that the non-personal and non-judging God (or Dao) has anything or can say anything to anyone at all.  So I discard any revelation given to man from God, as most anyone who's ever heard the voice of God also happens in our time to have a few screws loose.  The alleged voice of God told a Texas woman to drown her children.  The alleged voice of God told a man to cannibalize everyone he came across.  Voice of God?  No.  Voice of insanity?  Yes.  If God is telling you to kill yourself, it is not God, buy your own psychosis that you need immediate help with.    6.  5 answered  6 for me.  But here's a review.  Anyone who hears the voice of God-whether a shepherd 2,000 years ago or that homeless man on the corner today-is either 1. making it up, or 2. insane.    -------------------------------    In conclusion, I'm glad you asked this question, and I look forward to more thought provoking questions in the future.

oOR511mFaa	I think it is absolutely ridiculous for them to hate us and blame the worlds problems on our country. They hate us and treat our citizens with contempt when we take vacations in their countries because of what maybe 200 something years of blood shed when Europe has 1500 years of blood shed on their hands. We don't condemn them for that. Europe has brought all the bad things to the world in the last 100 years. Slavery, the holocaust etc. They act like they are innocent and don't wanna take ownership.    And i hate how some Europeans seem to really believe the actions of their ancestors were a favor to the world! That is very disturbing to me.There was a question the other day where Americans and Europeans were arguing about politics. One European wrote "Europeans created and built colonies in the west that later turned into the USA, if you are white we are probably your ancestors, if you are a descendant of black slaves, we are the ones that brought your ancestors over the atlantic" You have got to be kidding me right? I am Native American, black American and Puerto rican. All groups that have been harmed directly by Europeans. I don't blame any of them for their ancestors actions, but are you serious? They think they did the world a favor! I was thoroughly disgusted and amused.    Europe has done horrible things to the world, but they want to act as if those things never happened and take credit for the good things that have come out the countries they invaded. America is what it is now because of the American people. It has NOTHING to do with the British who invaded America all ties were severed over 200 years ago. We did not become a super power until after WWII.    The truth is white Europeans robbed the world of the truth and beauty of myriad native cultures  the Aztecs, Incans, Mayans were effectively destroyed and surviving native Americans rounded up and put on reservation. This is the same for all the other countries the British (especially), the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese etc have invaded. They don't know their own countries history, yet they call Americans stupid and ignorant? Wow. They have no right to condemn America for anything. That is my only problem with the English and other Europeans.    And if you want to find the real reason behind this war and  why they hate us all & why the Islamic world  hates us,  you have to do go back to 1953 were British MI6 ask our CIA to help them overthrow the Iranian president to help secure British oil rights. That's were it all started. Do not blame America and George Bush|`|d2yvR0Ruaa	Europeans do not deny the pain of the last century.  America is unfortunately misunderstood and all Europeans are not the same.  Maybe it is this pain that is helping some not to have a rational view of the world.  It is the Islamic world that blame America for everything.|`|IFf5r9zAaa	Which of Europe's 48 countries and 711million inhabitants exactly are you accusing of this?     Calling out the American government for the atrocities it has commited is not the same as denying the atrocities other countries have also commited.     Should people just say nothing if it involves America and sit back while Iraq burns and Israel literally gets let away with murder?     People from anywhere in the world are entitled to voice their opinions and protest about what they feel is wrong.    Europeans protest against the actions of governments in Europe too you know.     You're making a sweeping and ignorant statement.    This isn't a game of tit-for-tat and two wrong do not make a right.     You seem to somehow be implying that the disgraceful actions of many European countries mean that America should be allowed to commit disgraceful actions of its own.     Seriously, are you actually saying that Iran-Contra, Vietnam, Cuban embargo, Nicuragua, the Tuskegee study etc etc etc are actually acceptable purely on the grounds that other countries have done bad things too?     Come on. I, for one, don't blame America for everything. I ask that any government involved in ethically unsound and dangerous practices is held accountable for their actions, including governments in Europe.     And I'm European. So I guess that puts paid to your theory.    edit: I don't think you're listening to me. I just told you I don't blame America for everything. You seem to have decided you can read the minds of every single European and that not only do you know what we're all thinking, but that none of us should be allowed to be active or vocal in protesting any atrocities.     Do you honestly believe what you're saying makes any logical or ethical sense?    We have no "right" to say anything about America? Are you kidding me with this stuff? We have every right - it's called freedom of speech. Something that's part of the 1st Ammendment of your own constitution.     *shakes head in dismay*    edit: What MY ancestors have done? You don't even know what country in Europe I'm from. You do understand Europe is a continent and not a country, right?     You're ignorant, plain and simple. I'll say what I like, when I like and I'm not going to have some blinkered fool like you trying to restrict my freedom of speech because you think in generalisations.     i happen to know plenty of Americans who visit here on a regular basis, are treated very well and love it.     Once again, you make a sweeping statement with no basis in fact to back up your inane argument.     I am not denying European countries have commited atrocities. You have no idea what my views are or the extent of my objections to such things.     I'll thank you to stop assuming you do.|`|TLgiTFh4aa	17% of Americans are illiterate.

Religion is a drug and using mind altering things to run from reality is very weak.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  SO WHEN THAT DAY WHEN PEOPLE STOP DYING COME, TELL ME! AND TILL IT COMES, YOU GOTTA BELIEVE.  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:    rasoulallah.net--  islam-guide.com--  islamreligion.com/articles/204--  http://www.whyislam.org/Prophethood/Prop...|`|6MHuI3NXaa	i dont think its for the weak...  i just think its for people who believe,,,|`|JP1o1ggZaa	Is religion just for the weak?

GoRFRY2naa	A female goddess would be like a mother, to the horribly heartless father figure that is the god of the OT.  You could say that she would have been understanding and supportive, and would have "mothered" the pair about what is right and wrong, but in truth, a female deity, with compassion as Her guiding spirit, would NEVER HAVE SET UP SUCH A SYSTEM AS THE GARDEN OF EDEN, which was clearly designed by this all-knowing god, who supposedly knew they would sin, then creates them to sin, knowing they would, and then BLAMES THEM FOR DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE KNEW THEY WOULD DO!    It always strikes me as not only unfair, but utterly preposterous, and NO MOTHER would set up a system in which her kids would fail, knowing that they would fail, bc that is the height of cruelty.  Mothers want their children to succeed.     But most certainly, She wouldn't have blamed them for doing what the system aid they would do.    The world would be a much better place if the deity of the world had remained the Mother Goddess, who would have nurtured Her children, until that day would come when, in the course of human evolution, humans would recognize Her as a simply a Spiritual figure that had been created by them, and She would have smiled benevolently, opened Her had, and let her children graduate from the need of Her in their lives, as all kids do when they have been raised in a loving home, not in the tyrannical house of punishment, which is the home of the OT god.

Ask, seriously present yourself; say you want to start a food bank or clothes closet and you want the singles in the parish to help out.

hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|CmHLKKODaa	Because their Doctrines don't attempt to explain, just demand unwavering devotion !

Catholics and other denominations believe the same thing.  It's essential to the mystery of Christ's death on the cross.    It's heresy to say that Jesus's humanity died but His deity didn't.  If that's the case, then His suffering and death are pretense and makes a mockery out of our human suffering and death.    When He died, God experienced death too.  How can God die?

Further, they misunderstand the Trinity doctrine, not acknowledging the distinction between what God is (one divine Being) and who God is (three divine Persons). They keep arguing that because Jesus is a different person to God, Trinitarians are wrong - yet Trinitarians agree with them on that point!    This is why JWs imagine that if Jesus died, and Jesus is God, then God must have died and that is impossible, not least because their NWT wrongly renders Habakkuk 1:12 as God does not die. The correct rendering states, "Art thou not from everlasting. O Lord my God, mine Holy One? We shall not die." That changes everything!    Christians know that Jesus, the man - although retaining His divine nature - died physically, yet God the Father did not die, nor did God the Holy Spirit. Yes, the Word of God as Jesus, sustained the universe. Notice what happened as His death approached: the world became dark for 3 hours! From mid-day till His death, an eerie darkness descended as the light of the world was apparently being snuffed out. But because Jesus died sinless, death could not hold him, even for a nano-second! If only JWs could see the light of just who it was who died on that darkened hill!|`|N3fpoUOzaa	because there idiots who cant leave other people's religion alone because they want every one to be like them.    its quite annoying, every one should Just mind there own business no matter what other cultures or people belive in.|`|c3zUqmdXaa	Have you ever heard about BRAIN WASHING and NO BIBLICAL KNOWLEDGE?

And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.

They believe what the Bible states: that the Son of God died and was resurrected in order to pay the ransom for us.    It is Christendoms religions which claim that Jesus was God in the flesh and that since sin was infinite mankind needed an infinite atonement which only the death of God could satisfy.    That the Christianity of today rests solely on the doctrine of Jesus Christ, that he was God in human form and died on the cross as a suffering deity need no longer be explained. -- Emery H. Bancroft, Christian Theology, Zondervan Publishing House (1975), p. 95-156    This is what many Trinitarians teach, as is demonstrated by several responses this question. However, what is also apparent by the various answers here is that there is much confusion among religious people, all of which is caused by the teaching of the Trinity.    On the other hand, since Jehovahs Witnesses teach only the truth from the Bible they are not confused. Scripture teaches that Jesus died.  God cannot die.  Romans 1:23 and other verses say that God is immortal.  Immortal means "not subject to death."  This term applies only to God.     If Jesus died, he cannot be God, for God cannot die (1Timothy 1:17; Habakkuk 1:12). If Jesus is God, he cannot have died, for God cannot die. If Jesus did not in fact die then the ransom for mankind has not been paid. The Biblical teaching that Jesus died and was resurrected by God proves that Jesus and God are distinct and not equal in essence or ontologically    Many Trinitarians try to avoid the contradiction in their belief by resorting to a two nature theory. However, the argument that only the human part of Jesus died is a denial that God died for us. So the doctrine of the double nature of Christ not only conflicts with Scripture, it conflicts with the Trinitarian doctrine itself. If Jesus is the whole person and Jesus died, he cannot be immortal Deity.  Trinitarians argue that only Deity is sufficient to provide the necessary atonement.  But if the divine nature did not die, the ransom for mankind could not have been paid according to Trinitarian belief.    In spite of the irrationality of Trinitarian doctrines and the arguments supporting it, efforts to sustain them persist. The most unreasonable means of maintaining Trinitarian dogma are still employed, and with each new development the Trinitarian system produces greater confusion.    True Christians do not worship a god of confusion, they worship what they know and gain salvation because of knowing the True God and His son whom He sent.

For the most part they like to tell us that we believe that God died when Jesus died as we say the Jesus is God.  They have no understanding of the trinity at all, other than the twisted and perverted understanding taught by the "Almighty Watchtower".  However they should understand that Jesus did not die, his body did, but his spirit did not.  He was raised physically, although still God, he left himself a little lower by staying in the form of a Human until the time of his ascention as he was "seen" going up until he was "hidden by the clouds".  The same way he will be "Seen" coming back "invisibly?"  How?

This symbol  is a sacred syllable representing Brahman, the impersonal Absolute of Hinduism  omnipotent, omnipresent, and the source of all manifest existence... Brahman, in itself, is incomprehensible; so a symbol becomes mandatory to help us realize the Unknowable... Om, therefore, represents both the unmanifest (nirguna) and manifest (saguna) aspects of God... That is why it is called pranava, to mean that it pervades life and runs through our prana or breath.|`|iKmkRaqBaa	OM means Almighty. These are the echos on hill side, of the prayers of  saints.

EDIT: For those of you that must misinterpret scripture, read this:    Isaiah 45:7 contrasts opposites. Darkness is the opposite of light. However, evil is not the opposite of peace. The Hebrew word translated "peace" is sha?lo?m,2 which has many meanings, mostly related to the well being of individuals. Ra??a?h,3 the Hebrew word translated "evil" in the KJV often refers to adversity or calamity. There are two forms of the word. Strong's H7451a most often refers to moral evil, whereas Strong's H7451b (the form used here) most often refers to calamity or distress. Obviously, "calamity" is a better antonym of "peace" than "evil."|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	god did not create evil the devil and man did why you think a son hung on a cross because he was emo ?|`|macZI2dzaa	God did not create evil.

The concept of God is a philosophy; you create in your mind based on your experience.     You define a single point of an immortal ruler, who monitors you and punish or reward accordingly, where you become more responsible for your actions.   Also, you define the figure Satan and his or her attempts, to justify the course of your regretful actions.    This philosophy serves good as long as you use it for the said expected purpose. If you abuse it to achieve political power or to discriminate others, the consequences will be bad and not defined.    Any political or religious idea that makes you ignorant, greedy and/or hatred must be considered as stupid/ crazy, and avoid acting upon.    Never accept an idea because a higher raking personal said or because it is written in a well respected scripture or because it is a famous saying or even because your closest and loyal friend influenced you. Accept and act upon only based on your correct judgement.    Hope this will be an indirect answer to your question.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	God did not create evil! He created Lucifer who made himself a devil and unleashed evil upon the earth.|`|GMmmbLGRaa	1.)God created all things; 2) evil is a thing; 3) therefore, God created evil. If the first two premises are true, the conclusion is inescapable. But, God would not be good if He knowingly created evil. If independent evidence leads us to conclude that God exists and is good, then He would be incapable of creating evil. Something else, then, must be its source.First: 1) All things that God created are good; 2) evil is not good; 3) therefore, evil was not created by God. Second: 1) God created every thing; 2) God did not create evil; 3) therefore, evil is not a thing.God is good, making everything He created also good, then the conclusion--evil is not a thing--automatically follows.      God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? Numbers 23:19    He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he. Deuteronomy 32:4    Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. 2 Chronicles 19:7    For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.

Only assumptions is all.when you die you die there is no hell or heaven . your just dead. face reality and stop living in a dream.|`|4fTiCNiKaa	It might seem that if God created all things then evil must have been created by God. However, there is an assumption here that needs to be cleared up. Evil is not a "thing" like a rock or electricity. You can't have a jar of evil! Rather, evil is something that occurs, like running. Evil has no existence of its own; it is really a lack in a good thing. For example, holes are real but they only exist in something else. We call the absence of dirt a hole, but it cannot be separated from the dirt. So when God created, it is true that all that existed was good. One of the good things that God made was creatures who had the freedom to choose good. In order to have a real choice, God had to allow there to be something besides good to choose. So God allowed these free angels and humans to choose good or non-good (evil). When a bad relationship exists between two good things we call that evil, but it does not become a "thing" that required God to create it.    Hope this helps.

That there is only absolute good or absolute evil. When in fact there is good in al of us, it is we choose to use that good for our own selfish purposes. Look at many of the people we consider evil in the world. Hitler, had many good attributes, he was charismatic, intelligent, a good speaker, and was able to get the economy in Germany up and running after a terrible depression. Unfortunately he chose to use these gifts for his own selfish needs. There are many more that can be sighted along the same lines. So God did not create evil, He created good and it was chosen by some to be selfish and use that good for evil purposes.|`|srd6e3vuaa	God created man. God gave man free will. Man created evil.

Now we need God every single day of our lives, we would be absolutely nothing without him.

No more than the aesthetic and cultural richness it holds in comparison to many of the cities and countries in the Western Hemisphere as in Germany, Italy, China, Asia, and Greece.       So yes, other than a "cultural" and "memorable" effect or Historical benefit, there is not very much in the way of belief or evidence for a particular belief.  Other than perhaps a RC church or cathedral might house artifacts or books or writings that might support some of the Holy Bible .

AA12037424	No, the term "God fearing" refers to being respectful of His will and Word. Remember, the KJV (where "fear" is used most as an alliteration of "respect") was published in 1611.

Sounds like a southern American thing doesn't it?    Actually it is a phrase that was used a lot during colonial times used in reference to those who "fear the Lord" and the implication was usually in reference to a "wise religious person of good conscience and action" in accordance with the Proverb that says "the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the lord."    In the OT the high priest's assistants would tremble with fear during the yearly entry into the holy of hollies in the center most area of the tabernacle because if the priest was not ready he could be killed by the presence of god near the arc of the covenant.    That is why the priest had a rope attached to one of his ankles so his assistants could pull his corpse out in case of such manifestations.    You've got to understand, that in olden times whenever god's presence was manifested it was a very frightening affair.|`|4g9UKpyVaa	it means u have a conscience|`|YOynOfo5aa	Irrationality  Or used as description of fear of something presented as real, yet non-existent and imposed on sheeple by church|`|oVHFz52Laa	God can save us or let us to be separate from Him in eternity.

Conversely, if I choose to help someone who hurt me, and to bless them with love, then the next time someone hurts me I am more likely to bless them and love them.

XqpRYh52aa	There are no flaws in atheism.  Atheism is the lack of belief in the existence of gods,nothing more.  The 3 points that you make have nothing to do with atheism.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	1)  Some atheists are arrogant.  This is probably more of a human flaw than something inherent in atheism.  But still, inflated egos bother me.  2)  Atheists have not developed a time machine.  That would be cool.  3)  Atheism has not made me any richer.  I'd like to have more money.    Seriously, though, atheism isn't a position that has strengths or flaws, it's a denial of someone else's assertion (i.e., that god(s) exists).  Gaps in scientific knowledge are not flaws in atheism, they are simply things that have yet to be explained by a comprehensive scientific theory and supported by observable data.|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Science is like religion, bullshit until proven.

Call me a romantic, but I believe I am a freewill moral agent.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	1) M Theory looks promising.  All we need is a way to test the deductions.   The origin of the universe is a lot simpler than the origin of a deity, unless you resort to the fallacy of special pleading.    2) We are the only species to dominate the world.  Intelligence is a definite advantage.  The evolutionary pressures ar the same as for any other species.  We are just the first species that have solved their problems this way.  Or intelligence derives from our imagination.  We are way better than any other species in creating 'what if . . ' scenarios in our brain that allow us to creatively solve problems.  To me this is an obvious advantage in that a singe change allows us to deal with a huge range of problems.    3) Quantum physicists are reasonably happy with Quantum physics.  I agree that it does not go along with 'common sense' but then neither does relativity.   That the nano-scopic world does not act like the macroscopic world that we have evolved to survive in does not make it supernatural.        The biggest 'flaws' in atheism is that it does not give simple answers to the 'big' questions and that it does not give people a warm fuzzy feeling that someone up there cares for them and there is some ineffable reason for bad things happening.|`|L2V0ur7Haa	only one, and it's not really a flaw more like a draw back, and that's not having the eternal life security blanket, but hey that's life.|`|AA11207604	i dont think any atheist would say they have all the ansaers  i certainly wouldnt,nobody either christians or atheist  has all the answers|`|d265DZbHaa	1 Just because there are some weakness's in atheism, it does not mean the answer in religion or any other superstition.    2 Just because there are things we do not know, it does not mean the answer is religion or any other superstition.    3 Just because there are things we do not understand, it does not mean the answer is religion or any other superstition.

If you don't believe in god, then you don't believe in god.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	As people have already stated, the majority of us, it seems, are atheists because we see no evidence to support the notion of a god. So things like the veracity of the big bang are really here nor there, because there may be other explanations which also exclude god. Its not an either or matter.    However, I do see "flaws" with atheism, in a sense, and the topmost of these is that, while Christians get to go to their little social club and do community things, chat, have cakes together, I think I miss a lot of that. Number one, then, is that I'm not as much a part of the community as I would like or could be if I toed the line in an ovine fashion.    My second problem with atheism is that, for some reason, we seem to get more flak than anyone else from fundamentalists (Yes, I know, someone call me the WAAAAAAHmbulance). What is with these people, that you're okay, so long as you believe in SOMETHING? Maybe its because our presence unnerves them, showing them that its possible to live without a god - while all the other beliefs are kind of in the same imaginary boat together.    I can't think of a third problem right now. But I'm sure there are more.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Your three "flaws" don't have anything to do with atheism.    Those are indeed three areas of scientific research where all the answers aren't in yet, but they are cutting edge fields and one wouldn't assume our total understanding at this point in time.    Science does not equal atheism, as is evident by the considerable number of believers who are competent scientists.

Since there is absolutely nothing to point towards a sentient pre-big-bang force, the answer is not a blow to atheism. Since there is still no evidence whatsoever FOR a deity, concluding that one is needed for the start of the universe is simply incorrect.    2: This is fairly well understood already. For one thing, if a poulation of animals gets smarter, in terms of animals, then the smarter ones among the new population will still be better able to survive than the less intelligent ones in the population. The competition feeds itself, if you will, driving to higher and higher intelligence as competition WITHIN the species, not due to external pressures.    3: Quantum indeterminacy has nothing to do with supernatural forces. Claiming it does, or that supernatural forces are equally as likely as naturalistic forces, is nonsensical since supernatural forces have no evidence of existing WHATSOEVER, whereas naturalistic ones do.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	atheism is a belief that there are no gods    what does this have to do with the big bang or intelligence or quarks|`|peFtORvUaa	3 flaws?    1.logic  2.atheists  3.agenda|`|8gveZWbHaa	The reason I'm an atheist is because there's no evidence for any gods.

gYKJJtftaa	Very good question. Genesis tells us that God brought the flood because of the badness of man at that time. Noah and his family were the only faithful survivors.    Now, 1 or 2 thousand years later (I forget exactly how long) badness fills the earth again. All of this because of Satan the Devil's influence on humanity. So, God sent his only begotten son Jesus to earth to die for our sins if we followed the new way of worship, Christianity. Through Jesus' ministry he spread Christianity through out the region and today it is all over the world. When Armageddon arrives, those who are not believers will die in this final battle.    Satan and his demons will be abyssed (according to Revelation) for a thousand years. This state of inactivity will give faithful humans the opportunity to fulfill God's original purpose on the Earth with out the influence of the Devil, before he is completely destroyed forever.|`|yHfsHp6naa	IDK, because I never could make sense out of biblical nonsense.|`|Esl2Ogi7aa	the world had gotten so bad that god destroyed it with water.

The flood came because the wickedness of mankind was manifest on the earth and needed cleansing in order for the purpose of God to be realized.[sins]    Jesus came to deal with sin, the sin nature that makes a man follow the iniquity of his heart that passes down from generation to generation.    For the nature of man http://jayzuv.com/nee.html/ or the plan of the ages, http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/... .    Jesus came to not only cover sins but to do away with the sin nature, according to Hebrews.|`|8DRzJEfpaa	Because Yahweh likes BLAAD and HATES people.    He graduated from Babby killing, City leveling, flooding the earth to killing his own Son.    A rather typical Sociopath.|`|MED20HbPaa	It was all a foreshadow to Jesus. The flood is a symbol of Baptism where water is used to destroy sin and give someone a new life. Likewise, Moses crossing the Sea of Reeds is a symbol for Baptism as it shows how water again is used to destroy sin (the pursuer).    I don't think the Bible ever explicitly says that it forever destroyed sin. Rather, it destroyed sin for awhile. Likewise, when the Israelite slaves were brought through the Sea of Reeds and the Egyptian persuers were destroyed, many Israelites turned their backs on God and died in the desert without ever seeing the promised land. Furthermore, many people who are baptized for the forgiveness of sin will turn their backs on God during their physical lives (which is the "desert" that the Israelites experienced).  But for those that stay faithful, there will be a promised land and an opportunity to enter into rest after the long journey.    Jesus had to come and offer a path for everyone.|`|XVCbQ92Gaa	Because God knew that after the flood man would sin again. Jesus was not sent to be a reminder but rather to be a savior. The gates of heaven where not opened to man because of original sin, Jesus is our way of passage into heaven. We are sinners and are not worthy until Jesus saved us. He is the ultimate representation of God's love for mankind. No man would sacrifice the life of his own son only to save somebody unworthy of saving but God did. We cannot save ourselves, we need Jesus to save us first.
ctOge9SLaa	Amen. Ty sister for sharing this portion from the word because it really puts back into perspective what prayer is all about.   I am so impressed with the way we need to " look" or to be watchful. Ever notice how much prayer in the word is always linked together with watching?  How we need to watch and pray as believers.     It is just so comforting to know that as believers, our God knows our need even before it leaves our mouth.  We do not have to be like others who are anxious seekers, but may we be those who trust that our heavenly Father has His eyes on us and is actively arranging all things in our lives so that we can grow and mature in Him.    Matt 6:32  " For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things"    Vss 8.  Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows the things that you need of before you ask Him.    So dear sister, how we need to thank the Lord for giving us a way to be freed from being self-seekers and so self-centered. The saddest thing is a narrow believer in the Lord who treats the throne of Grace as a personal request station.  How we need to be continually delivered from this aspect of the Self daily by living a crucified life in Christ ( Gal 2:20)    Your question touches something that is very much supported with the pattern we see in the word of God.    Whenever we see prayer being lifted to God from the saints, it is with two main things in mind.    One, that the Will of the Father be done on the earth as it is in the Heavens.  For this we need to be set aside in our own selfish inclinations and come humbly before the Lord and tell Him, that we want to pray about what is on His heart. The beautiful thing about seeking first the Kingdom of Heaven and of praying for what is on God's heart is that, in the end, not only is God satisfied and is able to gain something through us, but we too feel a deep sense of satisfaction as well.      The second thing about prayer is that it is always linked to the need of others.  Here are some precious verses that truly echo the thoughts in your portion above.    Eph 6:18  By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.    Our brother Paul depended on the prayer and petition of the brothers and sisters to release the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to him while he was in prision.    Phil 1:19  For I know that for me, this will turn out to salvation THROUGH your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.    See how our prayers, petitions as believers is closely related to the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to others in need?    Hallelujah, may this kind of speaking from the word truly bring us into a different realm of praying and petitioning for the growth, maturity, supply, release and comfort of the dear brothers and sisters that the Lord has placed on our hearts to prayer about.  We can pray fighting prayers that target God's interest in people, to release them from the strongman satan.    Prayer is a real denial of ourselves, telling the Lord that we can do nothing and that we need Him in all things.  It is an aligning of our entire being with what Christ as our Great High Priest has been interceding for at the right hand of the Father.    We can really just praise our Lord, that He can broaden us to see outside our boxes. To tap into the higher kind of selfless prayers that ascend  as incense to the Throne of Grace. This kind of prayer moves the very Hand that holds the univese.   It binds and loosens things that have already been decided in the heavens unto the earth.    Hebrews 4:16  Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.    There is a great need amongst the saints all over the earth dear sister.  Are we going to be like the watchmen on the wall who sound off the horn to alert the Shepherd of the souls of the sisters and brothers?  When one is down and out, feeling defeated and battered by sin, satan and the world, do we pray and give the Lord a direct way to restore and release them from their dark places?  Oh sister, may our hearts be so easily moved by the Lord, to love people as He loves. For He ever lives and reigns to intercede for us. His existence and His reason for reigning is to pray for us.      He prays for our growth as His Body on the earth. He prays that we will overcome by His blood, by the word of our testimony and the denying of our soul life. He prays that we will be one with Him in prayer. That we will be rescued from being self centered and selfish.  Only prayers that touch what is on God's heart are truly given the best response from Him.  Everything else is noise in His ears.  He is rich in mercy to save us to the uttermost and bring us to the proper place before His throne of Grace. He wants to AMEN our prayers and He will because we are here learning HOW to pray as He teaches us day by day.    May the Lord continue to grow in us as we lay our entire being on the alter. Loving Him and all those who are His. The ones that He died for and the ones that He desires to grow and mature in each day.    Grace be with you sister  Yours in Christ  sandy|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	I spend alot of time praying for the souls of my unsaved family members.  Would you please pray for my parents and kids?  And I will make intercessory prayer for anyone you want me to pray for in your family.  Just let me know through e-mail.|`|funeSrxUaa	This is a good question and makes us think about our prayer life.      I think when people are going through trials and struggles, the focus tends to be more self centered (not in a bad way) because we want deliverance from our trials.  Even Paul asked God to remove a thorn from his side.    When things are going good we tend to pray more for others and their struggles.  We desire that our brothers, sisters, and even those who don't know the Lord, to be blessed the same way that we are being blessed.    Throughout my studies on prayers, I feel that many times we forget to return praise and thanks to God.  We're quick to make requests, either on our behalf or the behalf of others, but fail to thank God when we are delivered or blessed.  I believe that along with our requests, we should be in a mindset of thanksgiving.  "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God." (Philippians 4:6)|`|23kap6Feaa	r&s? No    THIS    IS     SPARTA

The further in time we get from the Garden of Eden, mankind becomes more corrupt & devises evil in his heart. Back then, a purity was resident in Adam & Eve, even though they sinned.

There were no other people in the Garden of Eden except Adam and Eve.  However, because of Adam and Eve's disobedience, we all inherited the sin nature. We are all sinners. Any of us can be homosexuals, murders, fornicators, thieves, adulterers, gossipers, addicts, gluttons or liars.  Probably even more than one of those. We all posses this sin nature, which causes us all to be born separated from God and do the things that He has told us not to do for our own good.    Jesus came to the earth for the purpose of becoming the blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins. Those of us who will choose Him as our Lord and Savior and repent (which means to turn away from sin), will be given the free gift of forgiveness and eternal life with God. When we choose Jesus, God declares us blameless. This is called justification (just as if Id never sinned) .    God doesn't want anyone to be lost. He loves us so much even though we are born sinners. He has provided Jesus sacrifice for us while we are still sinners.    Not choosing Jesus is the only way that we remain separated from God. After choosing Jesus as our Lord and Savior, It is then, our job to stay filled with the Holy Spirit that He has given to Christians (those who have accepted Jesus) for the help we need to obey Him.    God sanctifies us which means He makes us holy. Sanctification is living every day in light of who we are in Christ. It is practiced purity which is a challenge, especially in the culture in which we live.     Prayer, submitting and obedience is what God has ask us to do for our benefit.     Turning our backs on sin and coming to Jesus for love, leadership and forgiveness is the way to have a better life here, a renewed relationship with God and the promise of Heaven. The only way.|`|81SiImlSaa	Behold the Christian love we keep hearing about.    ....and Christonuts wonder why we have to hate them so.|`|8DRzJEfpaa	I don't know, but I strongly believe that Adam had an affair with that saucy Lamb called "Alexis"...|`|9pXeC0EGaa	There would have been roaring anal sex.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	The verse about Adam trying to find a suitable mate among the animals prior to God creating Eve strongly implies some beastiality was happening.|`|AA12037424	No. Such a notion wasn't possible until sin entered the equation of life.

We should study this instruction. It is our privilege to grow "unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Eph. 4:13). We are not to be thoughtless or careless in speech, hurting one another by unkind words.     Some who ought to be strong and established in Christ are as babes in understanding and experimental knowledge of the workings of the Spirit of God. After years of experience they are able to comprehend only the first principles of that grand system of faith and doctrine that constitutes the Christian religion. They do not comprehend that perfection of character which will receive the commendation: "Well done."     When we first receive Jesus into our hearts, we are as babes in religion; but we are not to remain babes in experience. We are to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; we are to attain to the full measure of the stature of men and women in him. We are to make advances, to gain new and rich experiences through faith, growing in trust and confidence and love, knowing God and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. God expects, in view of the great facilities he has provided for our advancement, that we shall grow; but many do not become more efficient, simply because they do not use the power that God has already given them. By a proper use of their intrusted talents, they might acquire tact and wisdom, and grow in efficiency. The unprofitable servant gave back his Lord's intrusted talent; but the Lord demanded the reason why he had not put to use that which had been given for that purpose.|`|VyR7efSHaa	CHRISTIAN MATURITY     Deuteronomy 30:11**-20 "The command that I am giving you today is not too difficult or beyond your reach.   It is not up in the sky. You do not have to ask, 'Who will go up and bring it down for us, so that we can hear it and obey it?'   Nor is it on the other side of the ocean. You do not have to ask, 'Who will go across the ocean and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and obey it?'   No, it is here with you. You know it and can quote it, so now obey it.   "Today I am giving you a choice between good and evil, between life and death.   If you obey the commands of the LORD your God, which I give you today, if you love him, obey him, and keep all his laws, then you will prosper and become a nation of many people. The LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are about to occupy.   But if you disobey and refuse to listen, and are led away to worship other gods, you will be destroyed---I warn you here and now. You will not live long in that land across the Jordan that you are about to occupy.   I am now giving you the choice between life and death, between God's blessing and God's curse, and I call heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Choose life.   Love the LORD your God, obey him and be faithful to him, and then you and your descendants will live long in the land that he promised to give your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."     Leviticus 11:44 I am the LORD your God, and you must keep yourselves holy, because I am holy.     Psalm 19:7-8 The law of the LORD is perfect; it gives new strength. The commands of the LORD are trustworthy, giving wisdom to those who lack it. The laws of the LORD are right, and those who obey them are happy. The commands of the LORD are just and give understanding to the mind.     Psalm 119:97-106 Oh how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. Thy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies; for they are ever with me. I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the aged, because I have kept thy precepts. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might observe thy word. I have not turned aside from thy judgments; for thou hast taught me. How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and light unto my path, I have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will observe thy righteous judgments.     (ALL of Proverbs Chapter 8)    Proverbs 27:17 People learn from one another, just as iron sharpens iron.     Isaiah 45:19 I have not spoken in secret or kept my purpose hidden. I did not require the people of Israel to look for me in a desolate waste. I am the LORD, and I speak the truth; I make known what is right."     Matthew 5:48 You must be perfect---just as your Father in heaven is perfect.     Romans 16:25-26 Let us give glory to God! He is able to make you stand firm in your faith, according to the Good News I preach about Jesus Christ and according to the revelation of the secret truth which was hidden for long ages in the past. Now, however, that truth has been brought out into the open through the writings of the prophets; and by the command of the eternal God it is made known to all nations, so that all may believe and obey.     1st Corinthians 2:6 Yet I do proclaim a message of wisdom to those who are spiritually mature. But it is not the wisdom that belongs to this world or to the powers that rule this world---powers that are losing their power.     1st Corinthians 3:1-3 My friends, you are acting like the people of this world. That's why I could not speak to you as spiritual people. You are like babies as far as your faith in Christ is concerned. So I had to treat you like babies and feed you milk. You could not take solid food, and you still cannot, because you are not yet spiritual. You are jealous and argue with each other. This proves that you are not spiritual and that you are acting like the people of this world.     1st Corinthians 13:11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.     1st Corinthians 14:20 Do not be like children in your thinking, my friends; be children [innocent] so far as evil is concerned, but be grown up in your thinking.     2nd Corinthians 5:16-18 We are careful not to judge people by what they seem to be, though we once judged Christ in that way. Anyone who belongs to Christ is a new person. The past is forgotten, and everything is new. God has done it all! He sent Christ to make peace between himself and us, and he has given us the work of making peace between himself and others.     Ephesians 4:13-16 And so we shall all come together to that oneness in our faith and in our knowledge of the Son of God; we shall become mature people, reaching to the very height of Christ's full stature. Then we shall no longer be children, carried by the waves and blown about by every shifting wind of the teaching of deceitful people, who lead others into error by the tricks they invent. Instead, by speaking the truth in a spirit of love, we must grow up in every way to Christ, who is the head. Under his control all the different parts of the body fit together, and the whole body is held together by every joint with which it is provided. So when each separate part works as it should, the whole body grows and builds itself up through love.     Philippians 1:9-11 I pray that your love will keep on growing and that you will fully know and understand how to make the right choices. Then you will still be pure and innocent when Christ returns.

XN0cYCATaa	How Entrenched are Atheist in THIER Delusions especially since Atheism is not Viable    In discussions with atheists, I don't hear any evidence for the validity of atheism.  There are no "proofs" that God does not exist in atheist circles; at least, none that I have heard -- especially since you can't prove a negative regarding God's existence.  Of course, that isn't to say that atheists haven't attempted to offer some proofs that God does not exist.  But their attempted proofs are invariably insufficient. After all, how do you prove there is no God in the universe?  How do you prove that in all places and all times, there is no God?  You can't. Besides, if there were a proof of Gods non-existence, then atheists would be continually using it.  But we don't hear of any such commonly held proof supporting atheism or denying Gods existence.  The atheist position is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove since it is an attempt to prove a negative.  Therefore, since there are no proofs for atheisms truth and there are no proofs that there is no God, the atheist must hold his position by faith.    "Since atheism cannot be proven and since disproving evidences for God does not prove there is no God, atheists have a position that is intellectually indefensible."Faith, however, is not something atheists like to claim as the basis of adhering to atheism.  Therefore, atheists must go on the attack and negate any evidences presented for Gods existence in order to give intellectual credence to their position.  If they can create an evidential vacuum in which no theistic argument can survive, their position can be seen as more intellectually viable.  It is in the negation of theistic proofs and evidences that atheism brings its self-justification to self-proclaimed life.    There is, however, only one way that atheism is intellectually defensible and that is in the abstract realm of simple possibility.  In other words, the atheist would have to propose that it may be possible that there is no God.1  But, stating that something is possible doesn't mean that it is a reality or that it is wise to adopt the position.  If I said it is possible that there is an ice cream factory on Jupiter, does that make it intellectually defensible or a position worth adopting merely because it is merely a possibility?   Not at all.  So, simply claiming a possibility based on nothing more than it being a possible option, no matter how remote, is not sufficient grounds for atheists to claim viability in their atheism. They must come up with more than "It is possible," or "There is no evidence for God," otherwise, there really must be an ice cream factory on Jupiter and the atheist should step up on the band wagon and start defending the position that Jupiterian ice cream exists.    At least we Christians have evidences for God's existence such as fulfilled biblical prophecy, Jesus' resurrection, the Transcendental Argument, the entropy problem, etc.    But there is another problem for atheists.  Refuting evidences for Gods existence does not prove atheism true anymore than refuting an eyewitness testimony of a marriage denies the reality of the marriage.  Since atheism cannot be proven and since disproving evidences for God does not prove there is no God, atheists have a position that is intellectually indefensible.  At best, atheists can only say that there are no convincing evidences for God so far presented.  They cannot say there are no evidences for God because the atheist cannot know all evidences that possibly exist in the world.  At best, the atheist can only say that the evidence so far presented has been insufficient.  This logically means that there could be evidences presented in the future that will suffice.  The atheist must acknowledge that there may indeed be a proof that has so far been undiscovered and that the existence of God is possible.  This would make the atheist more of an agnostic since at best the atheist can only be skeptical of Gods existence.    This is why atheists need to attack Christianity.  It is because Christianity makes very high claims concerning Gods existence which challenges their atheism and pokes holes in their vacuum.  They like the vacuum.  They like having the universe with only one god in it:  themselves.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	If you can get someone to actually believe a snake could talk, you can get them to believe ANYTHING.

C8gLsP3Taa	The Watchtower Society says: "The flesh of a sacrifice is always disposed of and put out of existence, so not corrupting...Accordingly, Jesus Christ was raised from the dead as a spirit person and not in the fleshly body in which he died as a human sacrifice." ("Things in Which it is Impossible for God to Lie," Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society of Pennsylvania, 1965, pp. 354-356). Is this what the Bible says?:    "Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have."   (Luke 24:39)      "The other disciples therefore said to him, 'We have seen the Lord.' So he said to them, 'Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.' And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, 'Peace to you!' Then He said to Thomas, 'Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing."   (John 20:25-27).    Who can one put their trust into an organization which makes up things as it goes along and as we see it has not even been around for 200 years and already has twistered the Bible so much. It is amazing how much they can twist the Bible and yet there is still those who cannot see their lies.|`|EJHhCDcaaa	Jesus was raised physically.  This was asked to Thomas, he didn't believe it was Jesus, so Jesus told him to feel him and to put his hand in his side.  Thomas did this and he felt him, he could see him and he sat down with Jesus and ate with him.      The JW's believe and are taught that Jesus's body was dissolved into gasses or something, so that no one could disturb or steal his body.     His body was not in the tomb. "He is not here, but He has risen." (Luke 24:1-8, NAS)       Jesus himself said that his body would be raised. In John 2:18-22 he said that he would raise his "body" in three days. Was he speaking of his own physical body or the church? Read verse 22 and note that "when therefore He was raised..." refers to his physical body.     18Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"       19Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."       20The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?" 21But the temple he had spoken of was his body. 22After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.|`|MMImKRAgaa	The Watchtower Society says: "The flesh of a sacrifice is disposed of, so that corrupt matter does not enter into heaven, but it is written Jesus at the first when he resurrected spoke to the women, and then to the disciples, but said handle me not for I have not been perfected. Meaning to me after this meeting he rose to his Father or heaven their he received his reward or glorified body. Later he returned to the disciples wherein they handled him, by his words to Thomas place your hand in his wounds and see.

He was Dissolved, which really causes a problem because if He was not raised in the same body He died in then He did not conquer death and was not raised !

"It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one. It is even so written: The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."    His physical body would not be corrupted (such as by decay.)  We know this is so because of what we read in Acts 2:30 & 31 -    "Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption."    Therefore, it becomes apparent that Jehovah somehow disposed of Jesus' body so it did not rot.    However, this did not prevent Jesus from being able to re-materialize his fleshly body, and even eat, when it suited his purpose, even as spirit angels in the Old Testament did on occasion. (John 20:19-29; compare Genesis 19:1-3)|`|z74a7wvlaa	JW has a corrupt version:  They believe that Jesus is 'a god'; some kind of a special human. Since He is human, as far JW are concern, he 'dust thou art, to dust returneth'. Yet they say He will rule in Heaven together with JW 144k.  Nice try with such a blatant lie and antibiblical, opposing: As St. Paul said, if Christ is not risen from the dead, then eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.  You get it.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:    rasoulallah.net--  islam-guide.com--  islamreligion.com/articles/204--  http://www.whyislam.org/Prophethood/Prop...|`|f5IcUlXTaa	Since the founding of the world Satan has been trying to destroy the Messiah.  It is all through the old testament.  When Jesus came and did exactly as was foretold, then all Satan could do was invent evil imaginations in the minds and hearts of men.

You can either tell your partner about the plans or keep it as a surprise. If you want to keep it as a surprise, make sure your partner does not have any other official priorities.     Plan a nice cozy place for lunch. Make sure you book your table in advance as most eating joints run packed on Valentines Day. You wouldn't want to stand in a long queue and make your loved one moan and complain. You can catch up on a nice movie before or after your lunch. What better way to unwind than going on a long drive and spending those stolen quiet moments with your beloved. Spend the evening in the arms of your beloved watching the sunset over the horizon.

They do not need salvation because they do not have the notion of sin.    I would imagine the bible-god has equal concern for all his creations.        "For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. "    Ecclesiastes 3:19    The Catholic viewpoint is this:    When Pope John Paul II declared in a public audience in 1990 that:     'also the animals possess a soul, and men must love and feel solidarity with our smaller brethren'     some people must have thought this was a new teaching, unaware of the Holy Father's scholarly familiarity with the authentic Hebrew texts.     He then went on to state that all animals are 'fruit of the creative action of the Holy Spirit and merit respect' and that they are 'as near to God as men are'.|`|HlFzl1piaa	I think your confusing humans and animals.|`|326183ad638c65397360f6a4dcc9abfaaa	dogs think that we're gods.  cats KNOW they're gods.|`|qNDh5U0Haa	I don't think animals are capable of that type of abstract thought.

Second of all, of course there are hypocritical Catholics. Same as in all other churches. Because people are human -- they sin. They are fallen creatures.     Third of all, even though we aren't perfect, we are supposed to strive for perfection and encourage others to do the same. So it just wouldn't do for a person who loves Jesus to say, "Go ahead and hate people..." or "Go ahead and cuss." It's better for them to say, "I believe it's wrong to hate...it's something I struggle with, but it's still wrong and I know I shouldn't do it." Or, "Cussing is wrong. I slip up sometimes myself, but I know it's wrong and I want to stop doing it."

9mLjDa5kaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed the truth about Jesus in this life or not.     So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|PDJjy0bPaa	Your heart stops and you go bye bye!|`|URO3gDXcaa	we cease to exist.  nothing else.|`|603754877c948533f683edbbdee32e41aa	Well if you haven't questioned it up until now, then don't worry about it until you're older.

Note what Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10 (AV) says regarding the condition of the dead: For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. This means that the dead cannot do anything and cannot feel anything.    The Bible teaching on the true condition of the dead relieves ones mind of much unnecessary fear and worry regarding those who have died. To know that such ones are not suffering helps us to appreciate far more Gods love, and his justice. Yet, one may still wonder, If a man dies and simply goes to the grave, what hope is there for the dead? The Bible reveals that there is a wonderful hope, the hope of living again.    During his earthly ministry Jesus Christ showed his power over death, actually bringing dead persons back to human life. (Luke 7:11-16; John 11:39-44) He thus provided a preview of what he will do on a grand scale in Gods new system of things. The heartwarming prospect is that then hell, mankinds common grave, will be emptied of its unconscious dead. (Revelation 20:13) Mankind will be brought back to enjoy life on a restored earthly paradise.Acts 24:15; Luke 23:43.
ozpB4ADVaa	I understand your question Star. I cannot believe the good people of my family would go to hell for not having followed Allah. I also cannot believe a good and just god would physically torture and punish someone for not believing in them.   Why give a person free will if you are going to be mad at them for not believing in your faith? It is quite contradictory and violent. And to answer your question, I rather burn in hell with my loved ones than believe in a god that would torture them while accepting me. Specially when my loved ones have done no harm to deserve such a severe unjust punishment. How can one sit in heaven and watch people of their family burn in hell - is that not torture in itself? It is not justified.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	I will be saddened (evn tho they are muslim). If they werent, God forbid, then i will keep my religion first. Nonetheless, someone is surely bound to hell...If you follow shaitan (satan) route's u will reach hell...    So its up to you to be open minded and not ask absurd questions like these....    You seem to have hatred for islam by ur question -   = Allah will forgive a disbeliever even if he is 100 and no matter about his sins...    = Child is born sinless in islam  - SO how come in christianity when ur born with sin u go to heaven only ?    = At night and latter parts of it Allah the Glorious, opens the gate of heaven and forgiveness so a slave may ask Him..That is when Tahajjud, the voluntary night prayer happens...    = A slave of Allah, when he prostates to the ground (as shown in prayer), he is the closest to Allah.    = Really whatever hatred u hear abt islam is from the bad deeds of muslims who neither practise nor follow islam in a common sense.    = All of the disbelievers such as christian missionaries fail to understand authentic evidence too!    =     Verily, We have sent it (this Quraan) down in the Night of Al?Qadr (Decree)[al-Qadr 97:1]    And (it is) a Quraan which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages[al-Israa 17:106]    And when We change a Verse (of the Quraan) in place of another  and Allaah knows best what He sends down  they (the disbelievers) say: You (O Muhammad) are but a Muftari! (forger, liar). Nay, but most of them know not.    Say (O Muhammad) Ruh?ul?Qudus [Jibreel (Gabriel)] has brought it (the Quraan) down from your Lord with truth, that it may make firm and strengthen (the Faith of) those who believe, and as a guidance and glad tidings to those who have submitted (to Allaah as Muslims).    And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: It is only a human being who teaches him (Muhammad). The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while this (the Quraan) is a clear Arabic tongue[al-Nahl 16:101-103]    ______________________________________...  These words sound similar to what swines are saying about islam?  ______________________________________...    1429 years ago Allah in the quran revealed many scientific facts, now u tell me, no one can prove so many right?     email me if you want the CLEAR signs.    They say our last prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was illiterate, and they say then how he can write letters and the quran which was revealed. well i speak hindi and english. If I write some words in arabic as to Love, Adeeb (my name) or I learn to write, Dear Goat, Happy birthday. Does these make me literate????????? [i will still be illiterate in Arabic - common sense]  ANd another example, is after me writing in Arabic, "Hello, dear" I would obviously tell someone to write it for me...  Point to be noted here is their language and style (1429 yrs back) was very different..so they said such sentences which could be translated either way..THe correct way is of muslims but the bad way is shown by disbelievers who know nothing but falsehood    Look How merciful is Allah -     O you who believe! Avoid suspicion as much (as possible): for suspicion in some cases is a sin: And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it. And fear Allah. For Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. [49:12]        Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la recorded that a cousin of Abu Hurayrah said, Ma`iz came to the Messenger of Allah salalahu alayhi wasalam and said, `O Allahs Messenger! I have committed adultery, and the Messenger (salalahu alyhi wasalam) turned away from him until Ma`iz repeated his statement four times.        The fifth time, the Prophet salalahu alayhi wasalam asked him, Have you committed adultery?        Ma` iz said, Yes.        The Prophet salalahu aalyhi wasalam asked, Do you know what adultery means?        Ma`iz said, 'Yes. I have illegally done with her what a husband legally does with his wife.        The Prophet salalahu alayhi wasalam said, 'What do you seek to accomplish by this statement? '        Ma`iz said, `I intend that you purify me.        The Prophet salalahu alayhi wasalam asked, Have you gone into her just as the stick goes into the kohl container and the rope goes into the well?        Ma`iz said, `Yes, O Allahs Messenger!        The Prophet salalahu alayhi wasalam commanded that Ma`iz be stoned to death and his order was carried out. The Prophet salalahu alayhi wasalamheard two men saying to one another, `Have you not seen the man who had Allah cover his secret, but his heart could not let him rest until he was stoned to death, just as the dog is stoned. The Prophet salalahu alyhi wasalam continued on and when he passed by the corpse of a donkey, he asked, 'Where are so-and-so? Dismount and eat from this donkey.'        They said, `May Allah forgive you, O Allahs Messenger! Would anyone eat this meat        The Prophet said; The backbiting you committed against your brother is worse as a meal than this meal. By He in Whose Hand is my soul! He is now swimming in the rivers of Paradise. "        This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration.

Sister! what you feel towards your family must be towards every human being who lives on this earth.. we need to live that life of Dawah.. we need to care about others , we need to show them this mercy Allah has blessed us with . we need to spend our lives in Saving others and seeking their Salvation.    we all have alot to do to our families and all people around us..    what are you planing to do with your parents? this is the most important Issue now.    may Allah be with you|`|lar1FyQBaa	my family and i accepted my cousin who became muslim.  i have nothing against muslims whatsoever.  infact, i know some beautiful lovely muslim people.  whenver our families have big get together's it's nice to see my cousin and her husband and children and we all have bar b q's...  i love my second cousins with all my heart.. they are beautiful children and well behaved as well.|`|3E2EQH12aa	this question is asked about once a month. and my answer is always the same thing. your parents your siblings your grandparents, if they are not in islam.. they are rebellious against Allah. there are good people in every religion, and in the end anyone with "an atom's weight" of iman in that there is only 1 God, will be saved from the fire.   personally, i accept it. we dont know where theyll end up, we dont know at this point if the person will accept islam before they die. really Allahu alim. but i know my mom and dad are very closed minded people, dont want to hear anything about religion, "dont get" even the most simple concept of anything in islam.. so be it. my master is Allah, and above any other i am obedient to Him. its not for me, or anyone, to sit and talk about fair or not fair, or can you accept it.     39:62 (Y. Ali) Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian and Disposer of all affairs.     39:63 (Y. Ali) To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth: and those who reject the Signs of Allah,- it is they who will be in loss.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Allah enters to paradise who he wills. Its not for you to say someones parents or family are going to Hell. Its Allah's judgment not yours.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	I think either all religions are wrong or they're all right. They all claim they are the only one's going to heaven.     If you do good in the world, if you try hard, make the most of life and help one another. you will be fine. I'm sure god/allah is pissed off that only the syco people are fanatically worshipping them. They're probably up there embarassed.|`|AA11264399	All religion is just fictitious nonsense so there's really nothing to worry about.|`|7Q33v5hOaa	Allah makes sure that he shows every individual the truth (Islam) and it is up to them whether they follow it or not.They made a conscious decision to reject the truth or did not bother to look into it and will be punished in Hell for this. They are rejecting the very one who gave them life, everything that they have, so how can you not expect them to be punished. They preferred this transitory life fulfilling thier desires instead of acknowledging Allah and worshipping him and being rewarded with heaven.   If a person takes an exam to get into university and they get an F they will have failed if they get an A they will have passed but if they don't take the exam at all how will they pass? Similarly how do those who do not believe in Allah expect to get into Heaven or avoid hell. Therefore to say that a person who does not believe in God leads an honest life is a false statement. They may have done no one else harm but they have done themselves a major major harm!!!|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Yes I believe it. I'm working on my grandmother's husband and working on my soon to be 9 year old sister and 6 year old brother about Islam. But only ALLAH(SWT) can decide if they'll become Muslims or not. Not me.

I believe in a higher presence- I just don't believe in organised religion for the simple reason that each and every one believes that they are correct and damn all other opinions.     There are people who live in the depths of rainforests who have worshipped the same gods since the dawn of time - how can religions such as Islam/Christianity which by comparison are relatively young suddenly claim that their god is supreme and even if you act in good faith damn you to the pits.     It's good that you have faith in something- just be wary when a religion claims to be supreme- tolerance is everything.|`|rM9QdK75aa	I'm a revert, and I used to have issues with this particular subject, esp after my mum passed away nearly 10 yrs ago now.

I try not to 'presume' anything about the Afterlife, I just strive to do my bit, and PRAY that my family will accept Islam before they die.    And Allah knows best  peace    EDIT: And what I'm trying to say is that, considering I'm not privy to who will end up where (meaning that ppl have until their last breath is drawn to accept Islam, and take their Shahadah), I try not to dwell on it too much.  And that's also the reason why I say Insha'Allah (God-Willing) my family will be ok.  It's out of my hands, and no one can predict what will happen.|`|Kiv4D2aWaa	Eh, they can't question what their Allah does, now, can they.

biFCKGAcaa	The Gayatri Mantra consists of twenty-four syllables - three lines of eight syllables each. The first line (Aum Bhur Bhuvah Swah) is considered an invocation, and is not technically a part of the original Gayatri Mantra as it appears in the Upanishads. Gayatri is also referred to as a Vedic poetic meter of 24 syllables or any hymn composed in this meter. Hence, there exists a whole family of Gayatri Mantras, which serve as meditative aids to pray for the blessings of a particular personal God.    Text of the Mantra -    AUM BHOOR BHUWAH SWAHA,  TAT SAVITUR VARENYAM  BHARGO DEVASAYA DHEEMAHI  DHIYO YO NAHA PRACHODAYAT.    Meaning of Gayatri Mantra -    Oh God! Thou art the Giver of Life,   Remover of pain and sorrow,  The Bestower of happiness,  Oh! Creator of the Universe,  May we receive thy supreme sin-destroying light,  May Thou guide our intellect in the right direction.    Gayatri Mantra Meaning (word by word)-     Aum = it is symbolic of Brahma   Bhoor = it stands for the essential spiritual energy (pran)   Bhuwah = destroyer of sufferings   Swaha = it represents happiness   Tat = it refers to the Paramatman or the divine spirit  Savitur = bright shining sun. It represents the creator of world  Varenyam = best   Bhargo = destroyer of sins   Devasya = it refers to the supreme God   Dheemahi = absorb the knowledge   Dhiyo = intelligence   Yo = who   Naha = our   Prachodayat = enlightenment  -|`|4WqvTAfmaa	Thank you to both writers who gave solid and informative answers.

The Gayatri, considered to be the holiest verse of the Vedas, has been paraphrased in different ways. The original Sanskrit is in the shape of a Vedic mantra and forms a formula for daily devotion of all Brahmins in the land.      "Let us adore the supremacy of that Divine Sun, the Godhead, who illuminates all, who recreates all, from whom all proceed, to whom all must return, whom we invoke to direct our understanding aright in our progress towards his holy seat."                                            -Sir William Jones|`|Pl9lY7qCaa	Aum Bhur Bhuvah Swah, Tat Savitur Varenyam  Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi, Dhiyo Yo Nah Prachodayat    ? ???????: ???: ????????????????? ? ????? ?????? ?????, ???? ?? ?: ?????????? ??    A basic translation can be given as...    Oh God, the Protector, the basis of all life, Who is self-existent, Who is free from all pains and Whose contact frees the soul from all troubles, Who pervades the Universe and sustains all, the Creator and Energizer of the whole Universe, the Giver of happiness, Who is worthy of acceptance, the most excellent, Who is Pure and the Purifier of all, let us embrace that very God, so that He may direct our mental faculties in the right direction.|`|xF8TvlhYaa	''That which  illuminates everything on the world, that illuminate me also.

236c93851f8140793a37dd76c210a733aa	The Holy Quran says the truth.    1-Jesus was not a god, he was just a human prophet like Abraham, Moses and Mohammed, Peace Be Upon them All.    2-It is illogical that there are two or three Gods, etc, because the harmony of this world and the whole universe is realized by One Superbeing, God or Allah.    3- It is, as you said, illogical that God forsakes his prophet, or as they claim, 'son'. In Islam, God did not forsake Jesus, Allah put another figure on the cross, and took Jesus up to Him.

Psa 50:17 You hate discipline. You toss my words behind you.   Psa 50:18 When you see a thief, you want to make friends with him. You keep company with people who commit adultery.   Psa 50:19 You let your mouth say anything evil. Your tongue plans deceit.   Psa 50:20 You sit and talk against your own brother. You slander your own mother's son.   Psa 50:21 When you did these things, I remained silent. That made you think I was like you. I will argue my point with you and lay it all out for you to see.   Psa 50:22 Consider this, you people who forget God. Otherwise, I will tear you to pieces, and there will be no one left to rescue you.   Psa 50:23 Whoever offers thanks as a sacrifice honors me. I will let everyone who continues in my way see the salvation that comes from God."    Job 15:4 Your words are enough to make others turn from God and lead them to doubt.   Job 15:5 And your sinful, scheming mind is the source of all you say.   Job 15:6 I am not here as your judge; your own words are witnesses against you.   Job 15:7 Were you the first human?

JDZdPo21aa	It's just a game on semantics. It's the burden of freedom of speech: people start to think that in freedom of speech, every opinion should be valued as equally important. Which is of course nonsense.    "I wanna kill you"  -Well, I prefer to stay alive if you don't mind  "Stop being so intolerant to my opinion"|`|UujliMsCaa	The word tolerance is a stupid word to describe what needs to happen in the first place. All tolerance means is that you put up with it. We don't need any more tolerance in this world. What we could use is a little more empathy - putting yourself in their shoes.  If all of us were willing to truly walk a mile in another's shoes, we wouldn't have a need for "tolerance". We could have understanding and compassion.  The road does go both ways, as you suggest.  The Christians need to understand that gays did NOT choose to be gay. They just didn't. It's an ignorant argument to make. The "liberals" need to understand that the Christians are trying to protect something that they feel very strongly is sacred. I'm sure if we understood each other a little better we could come up with a better solution than "I'm right... no I'm right. No you're wrong... no you're wrong".|`|HunSyQaSaa	Wouldn't you be legislating your morality? Why can't acceptance be put in the vocabulary?

We need to learn the difference between acceptance and tolerance.|`|OQdPzl15aa	Yes, I think to be fully tolerant, that includes respecting the right of others to disagree with you...and that includes those who are intolerant of homosexuality.    This doesn't mean you don't stand up for what you believe in, it just means that you respect the right of someone who choses to believe homosexuality is wrong, and also respect their right to practice voting.  Everyone votes according to personal values, so that's why I am so confused at why an issue such as homosexuality is up for people to vote on.    I don't support homosexuality, but at the same time I don't feel it's up to me to tell others how to live.  God is the only one who gets to do that, and at the end of the day, HE is the one who judges.|`|5syj6Uzaaa	Intolerance is not such a bad thing.  The person who promotes absolute tolerance is, in effect, promoting either that no one hold an opinion or that everyone hold the same opinion on everything.  The later is disqualified by the fact that we start from a position of disparate opinions on everything.  A single set of opinions must be adopted and the rejected opinions ruthlessly attacked.  Intolerance must be held supreme in the hope (probably vain) of achieving absolute tolerance.  This state (if it could be achieved) would be one of reducing all humans to automatons.    While writing this, I thought that I would render humans to the state of a vegetable by removing all opinions.  Yet even vegetables tolerate some environments over others.  To fully eradicate intolerance via this route, we must destroy all senses to the point at which individual humans do not exist.  Along this route, we must eradicate life.    Let's not talk then about tolerance.  Be proud of the things that you choose to not tolerate.  If you wish to debate, just be prepared to justify your choices.  People who proclaim both their broad intolerance as matters of fact (and without justification) yet consider themselves tolerant simply have not thought through their philosophy.|`|vWbbNd6Baa	Intolerant towards intolerance ... what?|`|anDDff6daa	You've got red on you.|`|KT7cllsLaa	Basically yes..in their book  Sad, really|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	its not intolerant to legislate morality    we already do it.

I have never understood why some Yanks go mad for Brit accents.   The ones they appear to like are usually considered upper classish in the UK.    I must say I prefer a well modulated Brit accent to American accents  Brit actors run rings around American actors.though I think actresses are pretty much equivalent.

You could start by NOT watching or listening to any BBC television or radio programme as they often have regional presenters/actors with incomprehensible accents. No one can understand them except the people from the town where they were raised.  Perhaps you should watch more Hollywood movies i.e. the ones with British actors or Americans who try to copy the accent (Dick Van Dyke?!). The problem is no one speaks like that in Britain anymore. In fact they never did!  Joking aside, the only effective way is to come and live here or get a partner from Britain.|`|RDWzGxb7aa	Well whatever you do, DONT try to get one of those terrible English accents that American actors put on, NO-ONE in the UK sounds like that, it is sometimes so bad that it make you laugh
h6vOjCaPaa	Though I am no Christian I agree with you on the important part. It is hard to represent a God of love and charity when one uses hate. And even for those of us who do not agree, instead of attacking another's believes why don't we just explain our own. That way instead of perpetuating the stereotype of the "Angry Atheist" or "judgmental Pagan" our Christian friends can understand WHY we believe or don't believe as we do and at the very least accept out choices as our own.|`|8e5366e765c8313efe9053e58aec2eeeaa	I try to explain - although from an opposite perspective as you.

I am here to do my best to answer the questions I can, possibly clear up a few misconceptions help everyone when and where I can. From reading your post I have come to the conclusion that you are much the same as I am we just differ on why we are this way. Should that make us bitter enemies I don't think so..      Christians, READ this post. THIS is how you should be preaching to the world. If you approach every question to your beliefs as if it were combat then that is what you are going to get. This goes for the Atheists and all the other ways of thought as well. WHY is it that we cannot learn from one another and still have our differences of opinion? Is it because we as humans are not strong enough in our beliefs, that we fear someone else's might be right?|`|mVsWyu0yaa	Sorry, but your question was lost in your overly verbose sermon.

THAT sort of elitism cannot be attributed to any but an insular, sectarian godling...NOT the Creator of the Universe.    everythingspeachy:   Bravo!

I will give every answer a look, but anytime it is any of that "you are going to hell" etc speech or whatever, I pay no mind to it. In fact, if there is a good message or answer or explanation I can take from even the most slanted and negative comment I will...I guess the best thing to do is to listen/read the actual underlying message and not get caught up in the "hate speech." Someone may have a very good point hidden under hatred and venom. I am more interested in their message, than how they go about spreading it.    I was trying to understand why people get so freaked out about religion, whether it is for it, against it, or trying to convince someone else about it.

RESPECT their decisions and their choices and if you think they are in danger of God turning his back on them....then pray for them....privately.

They do nothing wrong but not believe.    YES I AM A CHRISTIAN..but I also know that man has put many more rules and laws in religions...and we know they can't ALL be right.    Actually the Jewish religion is the oldest one..and it was the religion of Jesus..so if you look at it right...if you aren' t Jewish you are wrong.

I am sorry....I do believe in God and I know what God wants out of people..but people make up the sins and the can do's and cannot's and they change all the time.   GOD gave us the 10 commandments...that is what you live by...and God knows your heart.  If you are a good person and you have done good in your life...you can't fool God.  God is not going to turn his back on his children.

My mother in Glendale, Arizona would send me chocolate chips cookies on occasion. I got temporary duty orders to go to Barbers Point, Hawaii for 3 months duration. A package of cookies from my mom in Glendale, Arizona arrived in Rota, Spain right after I left for Barbers Point, Hawaii.     So the cookies were rerouted to Barbers Point, Hawaii.     After 3 months of duty in Barbers Point, Hawaii, I went back to Rota Spain. The package of cookies finally arrived right after I left Barbers Point, Hawaii for Rota, Spain again.    So the package of cookies was rerouted again from Barbers Point, Hawaii back to Rota Spain.     Within 2 weeks upon my returning to Rota Spain I got permanent orders to go back to Barbers Point, Hawaii to finish out my enlistment. The package of cookies arrived in Rota, Spain again right after I left for Barbers Point, Hawaii for my second tour of duty there.     So the package of cookies was rerouted again from Rota, Spain back to Barbers Point, Hawaii.    When I finally got the package it was flattened, torn and no whole cookies, but only a few moldy cookie crumbs remained.  I wrote to my mother to tell her that I got the cookies, but they were not edible. She wrote back that she was a little miffed at me for not thanking her for sending the cookies. But now she understood why. She said another package was soon arriving. I asked her to send it by Air Mail to get to me faster. She totally agreed.     What had happened was the traveling cookies was sent by regular mail (3rd class) and third class mail for the military was carried by ship. If my mom had sent the cookies by 1st class or Air Mail they would have been transported via Airplane and arrived within a week or less. By ship it could take 3 to 4 months one way.|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	While not myself who did so, my sister sent a TUMBLEWEED to my Aunt & Uncle in Rochester, NY!  Why?

Here is something which so few Christians grasp:  Non-religious people are instinctively repulsed by you.  You are creepy.    There is something 'off' about people who cannot see the obvious.    Example:    The, "You Won't Reach Heaven," line typifies the very reason there is so much resistance.  It is a psychological fear tactic both offensive and manipulative, just like virtually everything about that horrid religion.  I suspect Christ would strongly disapprove of how his teachings have been so thoroughly perverted.  Christ did not want people to follow like good little sheep, (sheep are sheered and then slaughtered).  Christ wanted people to *think*.  The kingdom of heaven is not a place.  It is the ultimate expression of the pure soul, one which has attained the highest degree of knowledge, critical judgment and attention to objective reality.  Flowery words and fairy tales and secret longings to be rewarded by a father figure for obeying better than anybody else are the hallmarks of culthood and childish automatic response behavior.    We live in a free will universe, and personal beliefs are one of the most precious and therefore coveted bits of spiritual real estate, desired by every cult member from every cult on the planet.    People feel the instinctive urge to protect the property of their mind because they know that if they lose it, then they are choosing ignorance and slavehood over knowledge and responsibility, and they are entirely wise to oppose this, what with so many submissive thinkers and spiritual predators skulking about.|`|okLzKbvRaa	There is a system and talk like this keeps you out of the loop.

wyYlpXcRaa	In the Holy Quran  you can read it's a sin to drink alcohol. And also in the sayings of Prophet Muhammed saw  u can find the prohibition.  That's the reason.      in 2: 219. They ask you (O Muhammad SAW) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: "In them is a great sin...    in 5:91. Shaitan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic  drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from As-Salat (the prayer).  So, will you not then abstain?      There is saying from the Prophet that clearly sums this up, "Of that which intoxicates in a large amount, a small amount is haram." Haram means that it is prohibited. Muslim's avoid sending mixed messages about their feelings by outright banning alcohol, even in cooking. The fact that a person couldn't get drunk from that small amount of alcohol doesn't change that it is haram.    Hope it helps.  Peace|`|zrz4bcalaa	It is a fundamentalist's issue.

O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination,- of Satan's handwork: Eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper.     91. Satan's plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you, with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah(God), and from prayer: will ye not then abstain?     Holy Quran-Maide|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  ALCOHOL IS BANNED BY GOD FOR IT MAKE YOU UNAWARE OF WHAT YOU DO OR WHAT YOU SAY, YOU MAY HURT OR KILL SOMEONE WHILE YOU'RE DRUNK FOR EXAMPLE. ALSO IT DAMAGES HEALTH, GOD PROMISED US IN THE HOLY QURAN TO GIVE US GOOD HEALTHY DELICIOUS WINE IN HEAVEN INSTEAD.  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|tJBvGea5aa	We Muslims do not drink Alcohol, not because some countries ban it, it is because Allah banned it in the Holy Quran. that is why we don't drink it. but if you want to know the wisdom behind that rule in Islam, there are too many disadvantages of alcohol far more than its advantages.    Compared to the few limited benefits of alcohol its risks and harms are so varied that, perhaps so many disadvantages may not be present in any other thing:      1. Through alcohol, the stomach gradually loses its ability to function       properly.    2. Causes loss of appetite.    3. It spoils ones facial features (Appearance)    4. Makes one age quicker.    5. Weakens and reduces the ability to think and speak properly.    6. Causes heart failure    7. The progeny of alcohol are weaker.    8. Creates fights and enmity between people    9. Leads towards grave sins, often adultery and murder are the direct       results of drinking.    10.

When your drunk you dont know what your doing so you could be doing haram|`|oEe2Rdifaa	it is forbided by God because you get out of controll when you drink it and you can't control yourself so you can't stop yourslef form doing sins.|`|p3UDlABeaa	ask that question  in the ramadan section of holidays (in religion and spirituality)|`|AA12386598	It is religious, just like the ban on gambling, fornication, stealing, murder and a lot of other social evils.  Alcohol leads to more traffic and arms related deaths than any other cause in the USA. It is now ranked 3rd in the causes of preventable deaths by the CDC.|`|qMwjrQbOaa	To my knowledge, there is no Islamic country in the world, completely banned alcohol. My experience is, majority of Islamic consume alcohol, when they live in western countries, and still go to mosque for prayers.    I honestly see abuse of religion among Islamic:    1. Halal is used as a licence to kill, where it is meant to understand it's consequences.    2. Only Qur'an as a religion states, marriage of one man to a one woman. Today, it's misinterpreted and licensed to marry one man to seven women.    3. Qur'an bans from getting advantage of another's agony. Today, most Islamic practice the opposite when doing business.    There are many examples if you analyse the Qur'an and compare with the practical Islamic community.    This does not count to all Islamic, where there is a minority of honest, wise and religious Islamic in our society.    Please mind, all Islamic are not Muslims. Even Muhammad who wrote the Qur'an, was from Quraysh tribe, who battled against Muslims and lost at Medina.|`|JiaGiVexaa	Simply because it is harmful to people. Do i need to explain why?  Well, drink driving (illegal), alcoholism, crimes under the influence, liver and kidney failure, heart attacks, cancer, harmful to the foetus in pregnant women........  So that is why it is forbidden, as well as anything else that harms our body. It's just for our well being.|`|XadHhxOSaa	i dont know why they arnt allowed to drink it but fact is that most of them drink it anyway and some of them produce there own! its like india, they arnt allowed to drink and yet they produce cobra and other beers
FcZU29W6aa	Oh, gosh, what a memory you have provided.    I loved that show -- my favorite character was Uncle Arthur.  His real name was Paul Lynn (spelling?).    He also used to be on Hollywood Squares and was once asked "Why do motorcyclists wear leather?"    His answer:  "Because chiffon wrinkles."    And, remember Samantha's mother -- what a character she was.  Also, remember there were actually 2 people who played her husband -- they just changed husbands and never mentioned the change.      Thanks for a fun memory.|`|2JvM6hucaa	I'd be more like Aunt Clara and cast a spell and turn myself into a duck.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	I'm a BB & my favorite character was Gladys Kravitz, the nosey neighbor. She was a real hoot! I can still hear her voice as she hollars to her husband to take a peek out the window to see what's going on at  the Steven's home.    edit: Alice Pierce played the part of Gladys Kravitz & died of cancer in 1966. She was 48 yrs. old.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	I liked Samantha's mother. Sam was a wimp. She still did house work and cooked meals even when Darrin was not around. All she had to do was turn him into a husband who did not mind her magic, but then the series would not have been interesting I guess.     Poppy|`|AA11296212	As a baby boomer, I watched "Bewitched," because the notion of a witch who only never used her power for evil was appealing.  I liked Larry, Darren's boss...he tolerated a great deal from the couple.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	I love her old grandmother that is always botching up her 'spells' and getting herself into trouble.  Can't remember her name...maybe it is her aunt.  Maybe Aunt Clara???  Been too long, can't remember.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	You bet. That was a great show.  Samantha was always nice, I liked Endora. You knew there was going to be trouble when she showed up.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Endora was the interesting character for me to watch.  Paul Lind (sp) played an uncle I think though I can't remember the name of the character. He was always funny.|`|oP3VVW5raa	I'm not really a baby boomer but I just love that show.  Samantha is so cool.  Much of what I say on here is to be read to the sound of Samantha's voice or Endora.  It's a game we played when we were kids constantly taking off different interesting characters on TV or where ever.    My favourite is Samantha,  she has a lot of style.|`|aXYiOskmaa	i liked it when i was young but for some reason, i can't stand it now.   darin always drove me crazy. even as a kid i knew he was a dork.  edit- my fave was aunt clara.|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	Yes I watched it and Mrs. Cravettes was my fav!!!|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	I'm a Boomer and still watch Bewitced.

I like Endora and Dr. Bombay.|`|AA10645224	I'M NOT A BABY BOOMER, BUT I KINDA LIKED BEWITCHED    SAM'S DAD|`|Emk4xuTuaa	I liked the show very much, watched it every time it was on.  Samantha & Aunt Clara.|`|T02ShQB2aa	As a kid, I always liked the episodes where Samantha's "groovy" cousin (I can't remember the character's name) came to cause trouble. I knew it was still Elizabeth Montgomery, but I was amazed that she could act so different! When I see the show now (rarely), I find it interesting to notice the difference between the earlier episodes where Sam dressed so conservatively, and the later ones with her microminiskirts. She seemed to become more like her cousin! Also, always liked the first Darren and disliked the second.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Loved it ! I had a big crush on Samantha. I still watch occasionally on some channel.
sM8PKUtoaa	this place is full of snobbie posh bastards|`|HzkDjDpyaa	It's 'you are', not 'your'.|`|dVEIOQhvaa	Yep, sure do.     And I can spell airs and graces too.    What about it?|`|AA12301710	no but i do have a lot of hairs and creases and I think I am getting old|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	No I dont think I am posh at all.|`|5c48bdd1f810bc8b29150c1be722cd66aa	What's wrong with having some grace?    Wouldn't it make life much nicer if people were well-mannered? I do not equate having airs and graces with being "posh". It means you've been brought up to be polite and consider others.    What's the alternative? Would you rather it if everyone was rude, inconsiderate and obnoxious?  Resenting well-mannered people for being "posh" is as pointless as resenting clever people for being "swots". Would you have us all in the gutter?!|`|hVuPqHzsaa	Of Course|`|lVAe2SLXaa	No airs, some graces, good manners, not posh.    Side note: POSH= Port Out, Starboard Home. Comes from shipboard travel; Officers had cabins on the port side when leaving Great Britain, and they took starboard side cabins when coming home. Don't know why but that is the story.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	'You are' or 'You're' but not 'your'.    It's not posh to try and do the right thing and to speak properly if that's what you mean.|`|peEgWlTDaa	And it's 'airs and graces', and heirs not hiers!|`|39q1CNLQaa	don't confuse airs and graces with good manners    having good manners , and speaking correctly does not make you 'posh'

May the sounds of Satan's records be lost in the outbreak of my laughter.  Miley Cyrus isn't smart enough to be the devil, as evil as her music is. The top 40 is too wide-spread to be the work of one Dark Lord, therefore those artists must be little more than His minions. You want to know the Devil's new label? Fiddy Cent. It has to be.|`|hVEGaRMbaa	Satan quit the music biz after he got royally screwed in that deal with Keith Richards...|`|4GiIXWUXaa	No honey, he still functions as the Worship Leader of a very large congregation of churchgoers.    I thought you knew that?    Secular music no longer had the same appeal so he went back into the ministry.    xoxo  ?
uzczwVT1aa	You don't embrace a religion because of its language, but its teachings and its message. Being a Muslim doesn't mean being Arab. You don't have to learn and be fluent in Arabic when becoming a Muslim, but it would be helpful if you learn a few verses in Arabic since some translations of the Qur'an are sometimes unreliable. We Muslims believe that Islam was a message preached by all prophets that came before the prophet Mohammad PBUH, we don't believe that he just invented a new religion out of nowhere. Abraham, Moses, Jesus, all of them, PBUT, were prophets that were sent to people to preach that there is only One God, and to worship Him only. Thats it. There are Arab Christians and Jews here too, will you say they are any less Christian or Jewish because they speak Arabic? Some Christians I know hate it when foreigners mistake them as Muslims only because they look Arab and speak arabic. In fact Arabs make only 20% of the Muslim nation today. Arab Christians and Jews say 'Allah' meaning 'God' and when talking about 'Jesus' we all say 'Isa', are they now Muslims because of this? No. Islam is for all, not just Arabs. Salam alaikom :)|`|y0q61lW9aa	LOL. thats cute, religion based on language...not factual in the least, but cute none the less. Islam is not based on a language silly! its based on belief in 1 True God. And English isn't nearly the first language or one of the first...so no authentic Original text is in english (as many of the other people on here have already stated) but then-most people don't come on here to learn truth, they just want other bias people to make snide comments with them-self validation?|`|ToztjpAsaa	Most Christians don't speak Hebrew either.|`|o4UrRbTvaa	You haven't looked into the history of the Bible have you? You are aware that it wasn't originally written in English by English people are you?  And are you aware that the Jewish people conduct at least half of their services in Hebrew?  Or Catholics services in Latin?  Are you aware that there are still illiterate back village people that study Buddhism?|`|WUjlEuTtaa	I agree...    I've never understood how the Koran HAS to be read in Arabic to be understood...Nor can I fathom how a book that is to recited can bring any sort of understanding...    Isn't that what translation is for?    Kelly, while the discussion is not about the Bible, might I suggest you trip over to the Ramadan section..Most Muslims will gladly tell you that the Koran is best learned in Arabic as things are "lost in the translation" in English...|`|lcvhhGjpaa	They have English translations these days.    http://qurango.com/english.html    Hasn't Christianity changed from the original Hebrew, considering they were all Jews, to Greek, then Latin, then English/French/Spanish?    If you want to convert back to Judaism, then you have to learn Hebrew.  It clearly states that God said that not one word or letter must be changed, this is why they still read it in Hebrew.       Really, your argument is moot.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Well most Catholics don't speak Latin.    Anyway.     The idea is that translation corrupts scriptures and given the arguments on here about the Bible, they may have a point.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Go figure.|`|34elYDjZaa	They were just copying the roman Catholics who use latin scriptures.|`|8e24cf4870f7acf4b978a06e284a53a8aa	Neither do most Buddhists speak Sanskrit or Pali|`|S4XUl7qWaa	What makes non-Aramaic, non-Hebrew speaking xians embrace xianity?|`|JiaGiVexaa	And yet kids as young as 8years old memorise the whole book by heart without being their language, how? Because they are words of god.   Second, english is not latin yet they are christians and so on, look in the history for a change. The beauty of the Koran is that it has never been changed not even a dot, that is because some meanings are bound to be lost in translation. So, who ever want to understand the Koran, or read about Islam there are many books in different languages so the non arab speakers would understand. But when it came to praying it has to be in its original form, in arabic. My husband does not speak arabic yet he has never found it hard at all to pray in arabic, it goes straight to your heart.|`|e3vQ4BWaaa	In the beginning of Islam ... lots of the non Arabs converted to Islam by knowing about It and Its peaceful towards the world ... Islam equalled between all people and called for peace ... and called to worship God The Only One .... They just understood the main point of The Religion, so they became Muslims and learnt the religions rules from the priests and those who kept The Holly Qur'an...    through the years Muslims have been trying to translate The meanings of The Qur'an to many languages ..The Arab Muslims with the non Arabs ...     If u ask about how the non Arabs can understand The Holly Qur'an... why don't u ask how the Arabs understand The other Holly Books ...?!     When the person search for the truth , he doesn't matter the language or the nationalty ... believe me ...|`|A5HPUGxraa	as others said other religions came in different languages so it is not odd or weird     if you studied arabic you will realize how the language is sophisticated (or you can say hard) the single word could have tons of meanings - and i mean tons of meanings- according to the pronounciation "the little signs above and below called tashkeel" or even the context that's why you can see some individuals who tried to translate Qur'aan failed to give the right meaning because it has to be somebody who completely understand the arabic language to know what exactly is the meaning of the words    and if you followed islamic sites you would found that they are not biased at least not any more they realized that islam is not just theirs and you will find a hell of sites in the english language    the wisdom of reading Qur'aan in the arabic language you will get when you start to hear it ..for me it is like a magic it heals my soul even if i'm not fully listening and understanding there is something you can't touch in the rythm itself (there are some people who believe they will recover from diseases by listening to it and you won't believe some of them do recover!! there must be something about it cannot just tell you about years and years of accidents)   there are some non-muslim friends i have who describes Qur'aan as relaxing yes something like that but muslims know that it is something much more than relaxing!  if you compared the translation with the original text there will be a hell of difference.. i heard once that there are people who converted to islam just after listening to Qur'aan    the experience does worth trying just compare yourself hear it and decide yourself  Translations of the Qur'an   http://en.quran.nu/  http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...  http://www.quran.net/http://en.quran.nu/  http://www.al-islam.org/Quran/  http://quranexplorer.com/quran/    good luck.. BTW thank you for giving me the chance to discover all these sites of Qur'aan .. if you needed anything you are welcome!|`|AA11392956	I agree with Johny. I once learned Christianity, some suggested to read the Hebrew/English version to get deeper meanings of the text. And now I am studying Buddhism from English translated sutras and books, yet there are people who willing to learn Pali and Sanskrit (and Indian/Nepalese/Chinese cultures too) to have wider understanding of the teaching. Most of us started by hearing parents' stories, from friends and teachers, reading books and translated scriptures, watching traditional art performance (that's related to some religion), in our native language; but some do feel those are just not enough, thinking translation and adoption have spoiled the original messages.

Obviously, there's the aspect of selfishness to consider and I won't deny that, but more importantly there's your partner's feelings. How would you feel knowing that your beloved partner killed themsevles to let you live, and that you have their body part because of it? That'd be pretty horrible to live with.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Yes. I'd probably kill myself from the guilt if I didn't, so the end result would be the same.

If I loved someone, what would be the point of me giving them my heart? I would be dead. I wouldn't be around to be with them, so what would be the point.    Either they die or I die. I'd rather it be them.   You can always find someone else to be with.   Love is a brain function, nothing more.|`|DO7lDtqxaa	I wouldn't give my life because I believe suicide is a sin.

4q66CvgLaa	jesus stated my father is greater than i and he prayed to his father not himself meaning that he was not part of some trinity , jesus was in the grave  and his father jehovah resurrected him now think if the 2/3 resurrected the 1/3 and that 1/3 sat on the right hand of himself while the other 1/3 did all the work and the 2/3 took credit wouldn't that indicate that that part of them died or did 2/3 die cos the other 1/3 was with him and the other 1/3 resided at the same time on earth and heaven,,,  .sounds confusing  , in fact jehovah has never died only his son did..anyone got an aspirin|`|lRaxAWfRaa	God will not be mocked!|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Good q for the trinitarians!    In actuality, Jesus, that is his spirit, wasn't dead. He went back and preached to the spirits in prison.   I Peter 3:18-20.    The body, of course, was dead.

OTnSwNwZaa	It has to do with the one drop rule. If you are any part Black, then you are Black.    It also has to do with the fact that most of the time, non-Blacks do not want Black features for their children or Black blood floating through their veins. Most non-Blacks in this world despise us and want little to do with us at all except for degrading us and profiting off of us.

And are they selling the men too?|`|LUWQ5S5jaa	No, one thought that sweety.  You can marry/date whomever no one cares!  Stop making yourself feel important.    Also it is not slavery time anymore, so you can stop using the word mulatto!|`|jTFdG8xqaa	Not really sure...It's an innate assumption for many that we would date one of our own color...but that is merely a survival instinct and quick assumption...I don't really know why people think this but am happy you are in such a wonderful relationship. enjoy life, ignore the dumb people in the corner.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	For those that may be thinking along those lines, perhaps it is due to thier lack of statisticle information on such matters.

SWP4m1cLaa	your question does not make sense !|`|AA10744471	God is the greatest. Muhammad is a prophet. God is the greatest because he is alive. Muhammad is dead because he was a man and not a God.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Simple! We believe God is the only devine who never dies, no spouses or offspring, but Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is just another noble human messager like Jesus and that's why he died.  Regarding the return of Prophet Isa Ibn Mariam (Jesus PBUH), yes we believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as you think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, not to teach anything new and with no message, but he will just come to make justice prevail instead of oppression, destroy the cross that you (Christians) worship thinking it's sacred, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and then finally (and most important) perform his last prayer with the Muslims AS ONE OF THEM, Muhammad followers, before he really dies like all other human Prophets and be buried.   Thats what Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) told us, that's what came in the Holy Quran, God's last book... and this is what I believe in. So if I denied Muhammad I wouldn't believe in the return of Jesus too, you see.  THE REASON JESUS IS THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO RETURN NOT MUHAMMAD IS THAT HIS RETURN IS GOING TO BE FOR ANNOUNCING THAT HE'S A MUSLIM TO YOU, A FOLLOWER OF THE LAST RIGHT RELIGION AND PROPHET, ISLAM AND MUHAMMAD, IN ORDER TO SHOW YOU (CHRISTIANS) HOW WRONG YOU'VE BEEN FOR THINKING JESUS WAS MURDERED AND FOR DENYING THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD WHO YOU WERE TOLD TO FOLLOW IN THE BIBLE.  Haven't you asked yourself why Jesus was left up to heaven if he's returing back to earth anyway? he could have stayed with us then, eh? but GOD wanted people to live without prophets around anymore, they delivered the message, and now it's time to see who will obey and who will deny... that what's it's all about, testing your faith after you've got the knowledge from the messangers, so God made one prophet die and kept the other away, you see.  Then just before the end of time, when it's time for everyone to get what they deserve, the same particular person you thought was God is gonna be sent by the real only God to tell and show you you're wrong.  SO NOW YOU KNOW, YOU WON'T HAVE AN EXCUSE WHEN HE COMES.  Before asking such questions in ignorance and be embarrassed, I think you need to read more about Islam, it tells everything|`|gBoUrlrKaa	Just wanted to point out that in Arabic, they do not put Ibn and then the mothers name. Just the fathers.|`|6SlBdQZ8aa	Well Sir,,,    I Dont Have right to say..anything..   But Isa IBN Maryam was the Prophet to the people of those times..and     Prophet Mohammed PBUH is the PRophet for this present nation..till The Judgement DAY.. And when Jesus PBUH will come he will not teach anything new..but will be in the religion of ISlam..and testify..there is no God but Allah and Prophet Mohammed is His messenger..     Its the command of the Prophet     Virtues and Merits of the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions [56:759]  Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr: The Prophet never used bad language neither a "Fahish nor a Mutafahish. He used to say "The best amongst you are those who have the best manners and character." (See Hadith No. 56 (B) Vol. 8)     Did you forget MICHEAL H. HART.. HE  CHose Prophet Mohammed PBUHat no.1 Position.. followed by Jesus PBUH    Al-Baqara [2:136]  Say (O Muslims), "We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya'q?b (Jacob), and to Al-Asbat [the offspring twelve sons of Ya'q?b (Jacob)], and that which has been given to M?sa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no DISTINCTION between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islam)."
ZeFyWGOCaa	Congratulations. You've taken a baby step toward cultural awareness. When you get out of the crib, you can wonder about the U in colour.|`|eskZfVBkaa	remember where the language comes from....so shouldnt the question b why do americans think that the letter z needs to be included in every word???|`|YoHroOcGaa	The Z is also pronounced as Zed in Canada|`|jTFdG8xqaa	um........................um...... What? Have you looked in a dictionary? Mokst any dictionary will have both spellings and pronuciations...the se is seen in most latin languages as a z sound so z is rarly used...does that answer the question? laser is spelled with an s pretty much all the time as is lesbian and many other words...so i don't really see where the British or european nations are all that different.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Lets face it, the english language / alphabet is a bit confusing.    IE: K-in Knife. Its silent why have it.  Phonetic- why not just Fonetic why confuse it all up.  Night or Knight..neither the k or the gh are used in pronunciation so why are they there why not just nite.    In Spain the letters ll together are pronounced as the y sound. The list goes on and on. Whoz rite whoz rong? Im so confused!
N5yp2TiRaa	...like Americans think the letter 'u' is non-existant...  color, flavor, humor etc.?|`|RDWzGxb7aa	I am English, and I don't think that the letter 'z' is non-existent. I quite happily use words like 'zoo', 'zodiac' 'zeal' and even 'zebra'. At the ends of words, where Americans write -ize, the British write -ise, it is just a spelling difference and it is ultimately inconsequential because we British can understand written American and Americans can understand books written in British English. Your argument is probably that they are pronounced like 'z' and so they should be written like that, and maybe you are right, but then for the sake of consistency, the entire spelling system of English should be revised to better reflect pronounciation. Using 's' and 'z' as an example, 'cats' is [k ae t s] in IPA, so the 's' is pronounced as an 's', whereas in 'cabs' it would be [k ae b z] where the 's' is pronounced as a 'z'. But you don't spell that differently. Further, what about '-ough', thorough, through, bough, tough, dough, and cough all have '-ough' and you might notice that they sound very different. But at the end of the day, we manage to understand each other without much real difficulty, so where is the problem?     There are differences between BE (British English) and GA (General American) that are more hindering to communication than how often we write 's' or 'z', but even these are not massively terrible. Differences in vocabulary can be quite confusing, 'pants' in GA means what British people would call 'trousers' or 'jeans'. In BE, pants means what Americans would call 'briefs', or so I gather.|`|qMKYjAMoaa	English originated in England.  Maybe it makes more sense to ask why the Americans love the letter Z so much.
1MgpiqfJaa	in Gods eyes both are important and he loves them the same as He loves you and I we are all His creation..He may hate what they have done but His love is still there|`|G9VBTg47aa	Neither. Both have equal spiritual rights should they feed the soul instead of the pocket, the drug adict clings to their drugs, and the rich wealthy sex offender to his money and addictions, yet the homeless person does not violate others. Lack of knowledge is mans worst enemy, yet the rich man must often avoid the mirror, and he is constantly fleeing, and so is the poor man, for he doe not take responsibility for his life but rather is intent on escaping reality in a haze of ignorance, but both men shall be equal in death. I wonder if the light of truth will be too great for them both?|`|25qUTYLEaa	Each life has value.

However, I personally  would help the poor homeless drug addict before I would help the rich wealthy sex offender.

It's just that some people aren't well behaved enough to earn the right to be around others and need to be segregated for the benefit and safety of the majority.    Drug addicts need help.

Why do you keep suggesting that every bad thing in this world is punishment?  Sin is its own punishment. It has its own consequences. God doesn't need to strike children with disabilities to prove some point. We live in an imperfect world. It's sad. It sucks. It's the nature of the sin that was brought into this world by Adam and Eve, but that's it. The original sin brought into this world death, disease, and sickness. The reason there are imperfections and disabilities is that God gave US the power to create and we are under the curse of death.|`|CfWXgwxBaa	Wow.          erm....NO.

If the children are mentally disabled of course they are destined to heaven, there's no question about it. Maybe your version of God will still see them as ''sinners'' and requiring mercy, but the Almighty God will seal their destiny to heaven in a heartbeat. No one on Earth needs to pray and convince God for that to happen.|`|Ib58NZUBaa	Yes  ur right|`|hJX6Ur3taa	You are correct.  The Bible clearly states that the consequences of sin will be passed down to the 3rd and 4th generations.  That is another reason besides personal consequences that we should become humble and repent.  However, these "curses" can be broken by asking God to remove them.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	if they are not mentally able to understand they will go to heaven after they die. God does not hold Sin against them.    Babies are born deformed because some thing the mother does or because of genetic defects or because of a accident.    The baby is not a sinner.

Please.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	NO|`|3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	God forms us in the womb, so? Even though we inherit the sin nature (from mans seed), we aren't accountable until we knowingly rebel against Gods love & word.    Disabled children many times generate a special kind of love.    Many times disabilities are because of the sins of parents (eating unbalanced, drugs, alcohol, etc.) or environmental sins or pharmaceutical sins or even the doctors, nurses, etc. sins.    Now one needs to seek God in how to care for a disabled child.      Also? What did Jesus say to those who asked why the man blind from birth was born this way. Jesus only said, so that He could heal him by the Power of the Holy Spirit.  They thought it was because of the parents sins. And it may have been. But God allowed it, so Jesus could heal him.|`|YYsldZcYaa	According to the story, retarded people can go to heaven too- you AND your kid have nothing to worry about.|`|Lp9PLSbuaa	Oh my goodness my oldest son is 19 and has Autism et for about three years after the diagnoses I blamed myself for getting pregnant out of wedlock, drinking mountain dew, cussing, lying, stealing, taking the Lords name in vain et so many more sins.

I feel so blessed that God loved me et trusted me so much he gave me my Son to love et care for.

If I had a nickel for every time somebody on this forum claimed that Catholics are devil-worshipers, idol-worshipers, Mary-worshipers, cannibals, pagans, apostates, and/or the anti-christ, I would be a very rich woman.    As to why people believe such a thing, it's not based on any logic that I can ascertain.  The thing about Protestantism is that its first and most basic premise and purpose is to *protest* against the Catholic Church.  That's why it exists in the first place.  Some people (I'm sure you can tell the type from some of the answers you've gotten) cling to the belief that the Catholic Church is inherently evil and all the things listed above solely for this reason.    It's pure nonsense, of course.  The Catholic Church has been faithfully following the Bible for nearly 2000 years and is the largest Christian Church in the world.

No, I don't support it, especially since I'm Catholic.    The reason the Catholics goes back to the Reformation. To justify a break from the Catholic Church, reformers had to prove, or at least make the argument, that the Catholic Church was invalid, bad, not with Christ, etc. This occurs during times when religion and state were blended, so if you're prince converted to Protestant, everyone becomes Protestant and are unified by that.   That's essentially what happened in England, Protestant became another way to form a heritage.  Then you have to factor in that in America, a country started by the English, the new immigrants were mostly Catholic. Anti-immigration gets blended with Anti-Catholicism and whammo! you've got the KKK and other "enthusiatic" people.

Apparently EVERY Pope has been the Anti-Christ for hundreds of years.    Supposedly Catholicism has been wooing people away from the "true" "invisible" Christian church for hundreds of years by "tricking" people with our false gospel, yada yada yada    Supposedly the "Whore of Babylon" in Revelations is the Catholic Church. (even though MOST Historians and Bible Scholars think it was probably the Roman Empire)    Supposedly We, Catholics, worship Mary and think our Pope is a god or THEE God.     Where's CJ  or Rene O  on this forum... they're always good for a few Anti-Catholic, fake Gospel rants.  hehehehehhehe    What's ODD is that MANY of them follow what the Catholic church does, what the Pope says, etc. in the media even more then Catholics do, themselves.  -- Almost like they are obsessed or something.    Fact is,  Catholicism was the FIRST Christian religion,  where everyone learned their doctrines from,  decided WHAT they would take and keep from it.  For the first 1500 years of Christianity,  Catholicism was basically it.  It wasn't until the 1500s that the OTHER denominations split off.  Sadly SOME are still trying to JUSTIFY why they broke off from the Catholic church hundreds of years later,  doing their BEST to point out all the things which are wrong with it.  Almost obsessively in my book.    ODD that the Catholic church is the only organization/institution that is STILL answering to things it did HUNDREDS if not a thousand years ago.  People STILL won't let the Inquisition down, even though it was as much a Political and State initiated thing on the side of Princes and Kings  then it was a Religious purification....but I digress.   The fact is.. we can forgive Germany,  we can forgive China and Russia,  but HELLS to the NO,  we can't forgive the ____  ____ Catholic church for its participation in the Inquisition BEFORE most of these denominations were even conceived of.     It is simply amazing to me. The Catholic church is the world's largest Educational institution and the Largest Health Care provider and Charitable works organization -- Yet we are still mired by what we did in the friggin middle ages. -- Simply amazing.

Read this;     on March 11, 2008 this what the vatican did; Vatican Adds Seven New Deadly Sins Including Damaging Environment and Drug Dealing.    The new deadly sins include polluting, genetic engineering, being obscenely rich, drug dealing, abortion, pedophilia and causing social injustice.    This is what the Bible says about this;    Revelation 22 :18For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:     19And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.    The Vatican Se also calls itself holy;    The Vatican City State, sovereign and independent, is the survivor of the papal states that in 1859 comprised an area of some 17,000 sq mi (44,030 sq km). During the struggle for Italian unification, from 1860 to 1870, most of this area became part of Italy. By an Italian law of May 13, 1871, the temporal power of the pope was abrogated, and the territory of the papacy was confined to the Vatican and Lateran palaces and the villa of Castel Gandolfo. The popes consistently refused to recognize this arrangement. The Lateran Treaty of Feb. 11, 1929, between the Vatican and the kingdom of Italy, established the autonomy of the Holy See.    What does the Bible say about this? Only God is Holy.    Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. Isaiah 6:3    The basic meaning of the word holy is to cut or to separate. This means God is completely separate from anyone, anything, any idea, any measurement, any imagination, any intellect, any power, etc. Some limit His holiness as meaning He is separate from evil. While that is true, I believe that definition is too limited in application of its meaning. HE IS SEPARATE FROM ALL. I prefer to say it this way: God is completely OTHER. What ever you can name, GOD IS OTHER. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. He is saying that He is completely beyond and completely OTHER than whatever we are or whatever we can think. GOD IS HOLY!!! Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou only art holy. (Revelation 15:4) Everything everywhere is connected to something else, but God is completely separate, God is HOLY.

Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|iHDYncuXaa	Nobody and nothing can make a true believer doubt their faith.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

Jesus is God's Son because it is written in Colossians 1:15     "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation."    Jesus was made in the image of God just as man was made in image of God. Jesus created directly by God, he was thus the begotten Son of God. Jesus was created before all other things, the firstborn. And God through Jesus and for Jesus all other things were created.

Modern Judaism generally recognizes a single set of canonical books known as the Tanakh, or Hebrew or Jewish Bible.[2] It comprises three parts: the Torah ("Teaching", also known as the Pentateuch or "Five Books of Moses"), the Prophets, and the Writings. It was primarily written in Hebrew with some small portions in Aramaic.    The Christian Bible includes the same books as the Tanakh (referred to in this context as the Old Testament), but usually in a different order, together with twenty-seven specifically Christian books collectively known as the New Testament. Those were originally written in Greek. Among some traditions, the Bible includes books that were not accepted in other traditions, often referred to as apocryphal. Eastern Orthodox Churches use all of the books that were incorporated into the Septuagint, to which they add the earliest Greek translation of the Deuterocanonicals;[3] Roman Catholics include seven of these books in their canon; and many Protestant Bibles follow the modern Jewish canon, excluding the additional books. Some editions of the Christian Bible have a separate Biblical apocrypha section for books not considered canonical.  According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word bible[4] is from Latin biblia, traced from the same word through Medieval Latin and Late Latin, as used in the phrase biblia sacra ("holy book" - "In the Latin of the Middle Ages, the neuter plural for Biblia (gen. bibliorum) gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (biblia, gen. bibliae, in which singular form the word has passed into the languages of the Western world."[5]). This stemmed from the Greek term ? ? ? ? (ta biblia ta hagia), "the holy books", which derived from ? (biblion),[6] "paper" or "scroll," the ordinary word for "book", which was originally a diminutive of ?? (byblos, "Egyptian papyrus"), possibly so called from the name of the Phoenician port Byblos from whence Egyptian papyrus was exported to Greece.    Biblical scholar Mark Hamilton states that the Greek phrase Ta biblia ("the books") was "an expression Hellenistic Jews used to describe their sacred books several centuries before the time of Jesus,"[7] and would have referred to the Septuagint.[8] The Online Etymology Dictionary states, "The Christian scripture was referred to in Greek as Ta Biblia as early as c.223."      Tanakh  Main article: Tanakh  The Tanakh (Hebrew: ??"?) consists of 24 books. Tanakh is an acronym for the three parts of the Hebrew Bible: the Torah ("Teaching/Law" also known as the Pentateuch), Nevi'im ("Prophets"), and Ketuvim ("Writings," or Hagiographa), and is used commonly by Jews but unfamiliar to many English speakers and others (Alexander 1999, p. 17). (See Table of books of Judeo-Christian Scripture).      Torah  Main article: Torah  The Torah, or "Instruction," is also known as the "Five Books" of Moses, thus Chumash from Hebrew meaning "fivesome," and Pentateuch from Greek meaning "five scroll-cases."    The Torah comprises the following five books:    1. Genesis, GeBereshit (??????)   2. Exodus, ExShemot (????)   3. Leviticus, LeVayikra (?????)   4. Numbers, NuBamidbar (?????)   5. Deuteronomy, DtDevarim (?????)   The Hebrew book titles come from the first words in the respective texts. The Hebrew title for Numbers, however, comes from the fifth word of that text.    The Torah focuses on three moments in the changing relationship between God and people. The first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the creation (or ordering) of the world, and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's covenant with the Hebrew patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel), and Jacob's children (the "Children of Israel"), especially Joseph. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of Ur, eventually to settle in the land of Canaan, and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of Moses, who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. His story coincides with the story of the liberation of the Children of Israel from slavery in Ancient Egypt, to the renewal of their covenant with God at Mount Sinai, and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation would be ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses.    The Torah contains the commandments, of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate amongst Jewish scholars, if this was written down completely in one moment, or if it was spread out during the 40 years in the wandering in the desert). These commandments provide the basis for Halakha (Jewish religious law). Tradition states that the number of

She's an intermediate: not necessary but helpful to some in bridging the gap between men and God.   Protestants always made a big fuss over it but Catholics don't think Mary or other saints are God: they feel just somewhat more related to them and get inspired by their lives.|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	Regarding intercessory prayer or praying to Mary and the Saints we Catholics don't pray to the dead,we pray to the living! those living with Christ are more alive than we are, because they are enjoying the beatific vision for all eternity. As Jesus said, God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore, we invoke their assistance by asking them to pray for us. It is as simple as that. Yes, we pray directly to God. But we also ask our brothers and sisters who have gone before us to pray to God for us as well. Just like if I asked you to pray for me. The Catholic Church is the family of God, both on earth and in heaven. We are not cut off from our loved ones in heaven, but through Christ, are joined to them through the Church. Since the prayers of the righteous are powerful, and those in heaven are righteous, we seek their prayers which are more powerful than ours can be.  Scripture is replete with verses that talk about intercessory prayer, we see in the Apocalypse how the prayers of the saints rise up as incense before the throne of God, God allows us to participate in Christ's mediation by praying for others.  Of course since the reformation Protestantism has lost this sense of intercession and today cannot grasp what has been lost.  God bless.|`|0fffe2e7ff7dc3c97a1c8297a89babd2aa	What exactly do you mean??|`|VFWRdAH3aa	we ask Mary and the Saints to pray for us just like you would ask your family and friends to pray for you.

A friend or another family member? Did you ever ask them for their prayers for you in a time of need?    That is what the Catholics do when they pray to Mary. Pray =/= worship. Pray = to ask.

Some may ask St. Francis of Assisi to pray with them for their animal getting healthier because he is the Saint on animals. its Not really Praying to them, rather then god, its more of them praying with that saint to god.    In my opinion all religions are a joke anyway, but i used to be catholic and studied in theology|`|xZet9Dunaa	Because she is very close to her son Jesus . Remember Jesus first miracle changing water into wine at the wedding feast ? His Mother ask him to do this for the bride and groom. That is just a sample. We also ask the saints for help also.

I hope this will help you to understand.|`|OC8NWQkyaa	If you can't ask a fellow Christian to pray for you, then I'm not sure where you're coming from!|`|1bcc0a57e83d93747625c74ecb78740aaa	Well as the first Christian Church and the only one for 1054 years, we are going to live forever, as the saints have before us. We ask for prayers from anyone who has faith. We believe that the saints and martyrs make intercessory prayer thier biggest priority, as they stand in the presence of God.

The priest does not ask your ID, as someone here said. It will be YOU to question your conscience, if you are worthy of the Body of Christ:  The RC Holy Mass is the Latin Rites of the Divine Liturgy of St James.    Brief history:   St James said that the words of the Liturgy were recited to him by the risen Christ himself saying, "God lives I have not added anything to or omitted anything from what I have heard from the Lord.  The oldest complete form of the Divine Liturgy still in use among the Christian churches.  It is based on the traditions of the ancient rite of the Early Christian Church of Jerusalem, as the Mystagogic Catecheses of St Cyril of Jerusalem imply. Forming the historical basis of the Liturgy of Antioch, it is still the principal liturgy of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Syrian Catholic Church in communion with Rome in Syriac and, in the Indian Orthodox Church, the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, and the Mar Thoma Church in translations into Malayalam, Hindi and English.  The Liturgy is associated with the name of James the Just, "brother" of Jesus and patriarch among the Jewish Christians at Jerusalem... .  The historic Christian liturgies are divided between Eastern and Western usages. Among the Eastern liturgies, the Liturgy of Saint James is one of the Antiochene group of liturgies, those ascribed to Saint James, to Saint Basil, and to Saint John Chrysostom.  Western usage is the Roman Church which is now latin.|`|bry9Tk3Maa	catholics are not christians|`|6ZRF1jW4aa	It's because the are elitists.|`|ZlYmbAVQaa	I just don't get it.

Nobody likes to be unwelcome in their own home, asked to leave, maybe to walk the streets, alone in the snow and rain and all that.  So you have to be sensitive to that.  OTOH she should be able to understand your wanting to be alone with your boyfriend, and that this is a two-way street, something you do for each other.    So just make a deal with her.  Give her advance notice so she can find something else to do, somewhere else to go.    When I was in school, we had a rule that if there was a necktie hanging on the doorknob, you didn't go in.

She will understand.    Or choose the night when she tells you she will be visiting her aunt or uncle at a far away town. Your choice. Then you do not have to even reveal what you intend to do the night that she is not there.    Be prepared to return the favor. When her bf comes over, step aside.

Is a Muslim allowed to believe in evolution as a scientific theory as long as he or she accepts that God is behind it?    Is a Muslim allowed to believe in human evolution?  If not, how can we explain the fossils of upright, bipedal, tool-using apes with large brains that have been discovered?    We wish to re-emphasize that our concern here is not with examining the scientific merits of the theory of evolution.  What we want to know is what Islamic teachings have to say about the idea.  Whether evolution is true or false scientifically is another matter altogether.    When we look at the sources of Islam  the Quran and Sunnah  we see that, with respect to human beings living on the Earth today, they are all descendants of Adam and Eve.    God also says:     O mankind!  We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another.  Verily, the most honorable of you with God is the one who is the most God-fearing. (Quran 49:13)    The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, identified the "male" mentioned in this verse as being Adam.  He said:     Human beings are the children of Adam and Adam was created from Earth.  God says: O mankind!  We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another.  Verily, the most honorable of you with God is the one who is the most God-fearing. (Al-Tirmidh?)    We also see that God created Adam directly without the agency of parents.    God says:    The similitude of Jesus before God is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: Be and he was. (Quran 3:59]    We also know that Eve was created from Adam without the agency of parents.    In the Quran, God states clearly:     O mankind!  Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a multitude of men and women. (Quran 4:1)    Therefore, the Quran tells us that Adam and his wife were the father and mother of all human beings living on the Earth today.  We know about this by way of direct revelation from God.    The direct creation of Adam (peace be upon him) can neither be confirmed nor denied by science in any way.  This is because the creation of Adam (peace be upon him) was a unique and singular historical event.  It is a matter of the Unseen and something that science does not have the power to confirm or deny.  As a matter of the Unseen, we believe it because God informs us about it.  We say the same for the miracles mentioned in the Quran.  Miraculous events, by their very nature, do not conform to scientific laws and their occurrence can neither be confirmed nor denied by science.    What about other living things, besides the human beings living on the Earth today?  What about plants, animals, fungi, and the like?    When we turn our attention to this question, we find that the Quran and Sunnah do not tell us much about the flora and fauna that was present on the Earth before or at the time of Adam and Eves arrived upon it.  The sacred texts also do not tell us how long ago Adam and Eve arrived upon the Earth.  Therefore, these are things we cannot ascertain from the sacred texts.    The only thing that the Quran and Sunnah require us to believe about the living things on Earth today is that God created them in whatever manner He decided to create them.    God says:     God is the Creator of all things and over all things He has authority. (Quran 39:62)    Indeed, God states specifically that He created all life forms:    And We made from water all living things. (Quran 21:30)    We know that God does what He pleases. God can create His creatures in any manner that He chooses.    Therefore, with respect to other living things, the Quran and Sunnah neither confirm nor deny the theory of biological evolution or the process referred to as natural selection.  The question of evolution remains purely a matter of scientific enquiry.  The theory of evolution must stand or fall on its own scientific merits  and that means the physical evidence that either confirms the theory or conflicts with it.    The role of science is only to observe and describe the patterns that God places in His creation.  If scientific observation shows a pattern in the evolution of species over time that can be described as natural selection, this is not in itself unbelief.  It is only unbelief for a person to think that this evolution took place on its own, and not as a creation of God.  A Muslim who accepts evolution or natural selection as a valid scientific theory must know that the theory is merely an explanation of one of the many observed patterns in Gods creation.

UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:    rasoulallah.net--  islam-guide.com--  islamreligion.com/articles/204--  http://www.whyislam.org/Prophethood/Prop...|`|AA11521494	No.  I tried for 22 years and it all got more and more improbable.|`|AA10741853	I don't understand what we have to be saved from if a loving god created everything.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	You mean the concept that 6000 years ago a rib-woman ate an apple because a snake told her to do it, and that has cast a psychic taint upon all of humanity that can only be expunged if you telepathically ask a jewish zombie who was his own father and rose from the dead to take it from you, then cannibalize him by symbolically eating his flesh and drinking his blood?

Christianity is rather a revelation to mankind. Unfortunately, you are asking this question to the wrong crowd. Many of them seem to be very confused  and don't even know what they're talking about.     One piece of advice that I want to give you: try to understand the basic things below before you go up. Biologists sometimes spent years to study one plant and still can not understand the mystery behind it.    Now, you want to understand the trinity: God the Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit with a limited knowledge? Jesus said to Nicodemus in John 3:, I am trying to explain you something over here on earth and you can't grasp the concepts, how do you suppose to understand heavenly things? I paraphrase it for you.    I was there with the Father, the Holy Spirit and I am telling you what I have heard and knew about us. You can't understand God except by His Spirit, except you're born with his Spirit.|`|WX1b747Iaa	I believe in personal responsibility, not shortcuts to forgiveness.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	I absolutely believe in the trinity and salvation.

God's Amazing Grace is beyond comprehension.  No, it doesn't make sense that He would give what he did for the sake of all of us sinners who know not what we do.    The trinity has been mysterious since the beginning and it is difficult to comprehend, but I do like to use the analogy of how H2O can take the form of ice, liquid, and steam.  Or how I can be a mother, daughter, and friend at the same time.    I do believe God understands that there are those who cannot believe,    and that even believers through the ages have had doubts - Mother Theresa and Martin Luther included.  It is a limitation of being human, and it does not affect his love for all.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Doesn't make sense to me, either.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Only in the way that after you've heard hours of shoe-horning and circular reasoning that all goes back to the claim that 'God's logic is not human logic' ...    you feel like saying "OK whatever YES it makes sense OK???

The governor replied with a question: What is truth?    Jehovah is the Source of spiritual truth. In fact, the psalmist David called Jehovah the God of truth. (Psalm 31:5; 43:3) Jesus acknowledged that his Fathers word is truth, and he also declared: It is written in the Prophets, And they will all be taught by Jehovah. Everyone that has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me. (John 6:45; 17:17; Isaiah 54:13) Clearly, then, those searching for the truth must be taught by Jehovah, the Grand Instructor. (Isaiah 30:20, 21) Truth seekers need to acquire the very knowledge of God. (Proverbs 2:5) And Jehovah has lovingly taught or conveyed the truth in various ways.    Therefore, if we love what is right and want to live in Gods new order, it is imperative that we walk in the truth. We should have the attitude of the psalmist who prayed: Make me know your own ways, O Jehovah; teach me your own paths. Make me walk in your truth and teach me. (Ps. 25:4, 5) Similarly, we should heed the prophet Samuels counsel to ancient Israel: You must not turn aside to follow the unrealities that are of no benefit and that do not deliver, . . . Only fear Jehovah, and you must serve him in truth with all your heart.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	Anything factual.    Faith does not qualify as truth, since we don't know if it's factual.

The justification for attributing life to inanimate objects was stated by David Hume in his Natural History of Religion (Section III): "There is a universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object those qualities with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious."    Animism is a belief held in many religions around the world, and is not, as some have purported, a type of religion in itself. It is a belief, such as shamanism, polytheism or monotheism, that is found in several religions    Some theories have been put forward that the belief in animism among early humans were the basis for the later evolution of religions. In this theory, initially put forward by Dr. E. B. Tylor, early humans initially worshipped local deities of nature, in a form of animism. These eventually grew into larger, polytheistic deities, such as gods of the sun and moon. Eventually these evolved into a belief in one, monotheistic God.|`|KT7cllsLaa	You dont have to Native, to be an Animist  In many parts of the world  people practice it

Personally, I see the beauty and symetry in most all things, and that is good. Then too, I respect others as having a bit of Deity in them.

I believe that the earth is a temple and all its animals, plants, rivers etc are our partners and teachers. I worship the Lady (the goddess - ruler of life) and the lord (her husband the god - ruler of the afterlife), who together created all that is, was, or will be. I also worship demi-gods, spirits of the natural world, and The Old Ones, and my ancestors.    Animistic religions like shamanism and Shinto etc. worships the spirits and animals of the natural world. They often place animal spirits above humans and regard them as ones who posses wisdom.

Separation of church and state means exactly that. No state interference in church business, no church interference in state business. Which means no laws based on religious morality or philosophy.    Edit - to the chap below who referenced my answer. No, it doesn't.

The less we see God in the public square the more we can do ungodly things. Remember every time they try to force religion  out of anywhere they are in violation of the first amendment because the are then trying to make laws in regard to religion, think of this they go to court toi remove Nativity scenes, remove prayer from school, take God off our money, remove Under God from our national Anthem, and not requiring people entering the Armed forces to swear under God to defend our nation  that is making  laws in regard to religion and a clear violation of our 1st amendment rights.     This is an example of how our for fathers viewed faith in politics.    On July 13, 1787, the Continental Congress passed "An Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United States." This law was passed again by the United States Congress and signed into law by President George Washington on August 4, 1789:       Article III  Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall be forever encouraged.  The Continental Congress on October 18, 1780, issued another Proclamation for a Day of Public Thanksgiving and Prayer:       Whereas it hath pleased Almighty God, the Father of all mercies, amidst the vicissitudes and calamities of war, to bestow blessings on the people of these states, which call for their devout and thankful acknowledgments, more especially in the late remarkable interposition of his watchful providence, in the rescuing the person of our Commander-in-Chief and the army from imminent dangers, at the moment when treason was ripened for execution...     It is therefore recommended to the several states...a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, that all the people may assemble on that day celebrate the praises of our Divine Benefactor; to confess our unworthiness of the least of His favors, and to offer our fervent supplication to the God of all grace...to cause the knowledge of Christianity to spread over all the earth.     May 16, 1776, the Continental Congress appointed an official national day of fasting and prayer for the colonies:       The Congress....Desirous...to have people of all ranks and degrees duly impressed with a solemn sense of God's superintending providence, and of their duty, devoutly to rely...on His aid and direction...Do earnestly recommend Friday, the 17th day of May be observed by the colonies as a day of humiliation, fasting, and prayer; that we may, with united hearts, confess and bewailed our manifold sins and transgressions, and, by sincere repentance and amendment of life, appease God's righteous displeasure, and, through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, obtain this pardon and forgiveness.    The Continental Congress on September 11, 1777, ordered the importation of 20,000 Bibles for the American troops. The law read as follows:       The use of the Bible is so universal and its importance so great that your committee refers the above to the consideration of Congress, and if Congress shall not think it expedient to order the importation of types and paper, the Committee recommends that Congress will order the Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from Holland, Scotland, or elsewhere, into the different parts of the States of the Union.   Whereupon it was resolved accordingly to direct said Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 copies of the Bible.    Indeed, the Congress authorized its endorsement to be printed on the front page of the edition of the Bible approved for the American people:       Whereupon, Resolved, that the Unites States in Congress assembled...recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of the Unites States, and hereby authorize [Robert Aitken] to publish this recommendation in the manner he shall think proper.

jz9CnL2Eaa	My best friend from childhood passed away a few years ago.  We hadn't spoken to or seen each other in 20 years, and yet I felt compelled to reach out to her mother, in sympathy, after learning of her death (a few months after it).      I first expressed my sadness at hearing of the news and how my thoughts and prayers were with the mom at the time of this incredible loss.  I then wrote something along the lines of, "While C and I hadn't kept in touch past high school and into adulthood, my thoughts have been frequent, throughout the years, of our childhood, the friendship we shared, and the lessons she taught me,"  I then went on to talk about a few specific anecdotes, stories, and memories.    Her mom wrote me back, saying of all the letters and cards of sympathy she received, she appreciated mine the most - it was the most personal and heartfelt and she looked forward to sharing it with her daughter's husband and family.      My point is, it doesn't matter how much time has passed since you last talked with your friend or how much time has passed since he has died.  What matters is the sincerity and the personalization you put into your expression of sympathy.  The family will be touched, I am certain.|`|omegLbOAaa	it's never too late. find a nice card & send it with note that says you just learned of his passing, and although the two of you didn't talk as frequently as you would have liked, he was a good a friend to you & his death weighs heavily on your heart. please accept my deepest sympathies...|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	It is never too late.

" FACT: The atheist dictators of the 20th century accounted for more violent deaths than all previous ones since before Christianity came into existence. The bloodiest war ever was the first world war which started when an atheist shot a Catholic prince."    The truth is that the assassin was a revolutionary who wanted Serbian independence. Austria then declared war on Serbia.  What precipitated WWI wasn't an atheist v. religious conflict.  It was entanglement in alliances.  The conflict would have been a very simple one had it not been for alliances, and for the posturing of European monarchs such as Wilhelm II, who was already spoiling for a war.     "FACT: then there was Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot. Between them they have accounted for MORE violent deaths than all the Christian and Muslim warlords put together."    Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot didn't act in the name of atheism.  Such a thing would be ludicrous anyway, since atheism is simply a denial of a particular set of beliefs.  What atheism does is demand evidence for those beliefs.  No war has ever been started for demanding evidence. Further, the atrocities committed by the communist leaders had nothing to do with atheism, which is a lack of an irrational belief system.  It had everything to do with replacing one irrational, life-denying belief system with another: Marxism.  Stalin's purges weren't due to doctrines of any kind, but to his own paranoia.  His paranoia is well-documented, and it is also well-documented that paranoia is utterly irrational and independent of doctrine. Mao's atrocities were related to the party trying to retire him in the 1960's.   He launched the cultural revolution in order to hold onto power.  Pol Pot's attrocities were also a bid to hold onto power.    "This is just two examples as there are plenty more, Hitler, Attila or Kublai Khan, etc etc. But when has the truth ever worried atheists."    Hitler was not an atheist, as is well-documented. He may not have been Christian, but he certainly wasn't atheist.  Attila and Kublai Khan, well...we'll just say [citation needed].       "A typical (and this is a fair generalization on R&S) Atheist question starts with a statement about Christianity that is flawed in some major way and then attempts to show how silly or angering or evil it is when if we could only change the statement to reflect what the Bible really and fully teaches about the issue the accusation would disappear. I do not think they would have much ground to stand on if they attacked genuine biblical Christianity."    Just like what you did with atheism.  Christianity does this regularly with atheism and other religions.  Take the plank out of your own eye.     "To say that everything there is to know has already been learned would be foolish. To say that man knows everything would be foolish. However, atheists know everything and if they say something doesn't exist, ghosts, spirits, afterlife, God, etc etc etc well then they must be right or Fools....."    You know that the Tooth Fairy and Santa Clause don't exist the same way that atheists know that God doesn't exist.  Either you are right or a fool.    The overarching answer is that any irrational set of beliefs is the broad path to death and destruction.|`|Ob0GqDc1aa	ATHIESTS SBECAUSE THE4Y BELIEVE WEE VOELD FROM MONKES BY RANDOM CHCNAE|`|URO3gDXcaa	everyone knows its windy.|`|7sEFufRbaa	atheists post mainly lies and distortions of the truth.

All the wars in the religious books of all religions are of Satan's work, and if they truly knew the one and only true God, they would know that he is love and has nothing to do with war.    That is why Jesus told the multitude who feared and hated him, that their father is the devil.  Jesus never joined any church if you truly understood the truth, not taught by men, but by God.    Jesus died for the dead and upon his crucifixion the light had been taken from the world, but at this time in the history of mankind, Satan has and is being turned loose for a short season, as prophesied about in the book of Revelation.    Men teach that the rapture shall take away the righteous, when Jesus taught through the parables in St. Matthews, 13.  That evil shall be taken away, while in Rev. 3; 12.  Gods city shall come down from heaven and those who are non-believers or follow men, will never believe such things and they will laugh  and render such truths as falsehood, just as they laughed at Noah for building an Ark in the desert with no rain in sight.   God never does what men think, for God is God and is all so powerful.    This world is about to become more eviler so when Gods avenging angels come there shall be no mistake who his chosen are and who follow Satan.  For Gods chosen are at war with no one or anybody.   God is giving all of mankind a choice of which path to follow.  The majority seems to follow the ways of the world or the church they follow.  Those called the New Jerusalem by God shall follow God and not the ways of the world around them.    Our country has become the beast and all who have followed it are about to fall, yet none will believe.  This country has become arrogant, selfish, and evil as they've moved further and further from the truth that has created the freedoms we have here.  God.

It all very parasites like really  There is no such thing as race or religion, thats just man categorizing in order to recognize.   Homa sapians wiped out other intelligent bipeds many thousands of years ago.   What we have right now are culture clashes as a result of many mind sets being colloquial, uneducated and indoctrinated.  I.E. Living in our own little world    It's all still very insane as long as primitive mans ego needs to invent where he came from in order to know where he is going. never mind know what he is doing.   Maybe this will always be so.    We are a perpetually, accentuating product of environmental circumstance that has no choice other than to do onto others as was done onto us without incurring some damage and knowledge upon ourselves.  We learn and then perpetuate our behavior whilst exhibiting our hierarchical status, this is what we know as culture.

You CANNOT be demon possessed and have Christ in your heart.      However, the devil and his demons are very real and they can try to scare and oppress you.  Did you know that they are afraid of even the name of Jesus?  Whenever you feel this way, say (out loud) "I rebuke you in the name of Jesus!"      The devil lies, steals, and destroys.  He wants you to think you are hopeless but NO ONE is hopeless.  Jesus died for ALL sin of every kind.  No matter how bad you think you are or have been, God is faithful to forgive you if you have asked.  In fact, He doesn't even remember your sin anymore once you have asked for forgiveness.  You can't be bad enough or good enough to make any difference about going to heaven.  The only way to get to heaven is to believe that Jesus died for your sins and accept Him into your heart.  If you have done that, please see my other post for what you should do to continue growing closer and closer to Him.

For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice.  Now if I do what I will not to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.  find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. 22 For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?" (Romans 7:17-24).   What I can to say to you, man, is that yes, you can be saved no matter how many sins you have done or how grave they are.

In Romans 7:15 he says with great honesty, "The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin. I dont really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I dont do it. Instead, I do what I hate."    But he then goes on in Romans 8:38 to confirm that there is nothing we can do to separate us from God's love for us - "I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from Gods love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrownot even the powers of hell can separate us from Gods love."    Remember these two key promises:    1 John 1:9 - But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.    John 3:16 - For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.    God Bless!

If she doesn't want you to go in then I'm sure you will be able to tell and just say that you hope she enjoys them.   Good on you - the world needs caring people.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	Oh yes please try this.  She is probably lonely and has dementia therefore it's very important that someone take a moment to check in with her.  It's very nice of you to care about her and to ask this question.|`|WZVz5jWHaa	You are a dear one!  I know the neighbor would so appreciate not only your visit but your company as well. Be sure she is not diabetic before taking her some baked goodies.  What a wonderful person you are.|`|ZW0JHvdraa	The fact that you asked this question shows that you are very caring & kind.  Most people don't even pay attention to their neighbors, let alone express concern about an elderly person!    We have an elderly person that lives across the street from us (she is 97 years old!)  She is a former school teacher, her husband passed away many years ago, and her children live far away, but do keep in touch with her.  However, we do look in on her at least once a week, plow the snow for her, and sometimes just stop in to chat.  Her mind is very sharp, and although she does walk with a cane, she still drives!      One day I stopped over to say hello only to learn that she was not feeling well, and not able to drive herself to see the doctor. I asked her why she didn't call & let us know, and she replied that she doesn't want to be a nuisance, and thought that she would take a taxi to the doctor.  Needless to say, I drove her to the doctor, and she is fine now.      I would say yes, do stop over to say hello now & then.  Take some cookies or something with you, and just tell her you thought she might enjoy some.  A simple kindness will not only make her feel good, but yourself as well!  Don't worry if she doesn't remember you from time to time, because recognition is not what kindness is about anyway.    Your children will bring her much joy as well, and the stimulation is good for her.  God Bless!|`|5c48bdd1f810bc8b29150c1be722cd66aa	It's lovely that you are thinking of this lonely lady and it would certainly improve her quality of life but I would caution you to be careful. Elderly people, particularly those with mental health needs, can be quite a handful. They can become very demanding and if she does have dementia be prepared for the fact that it will only get worse. Her behaviour may change - dementia sufferers can become depressed, anxious and aggressive. If you already have commitments at home with your children, you may want to make it clear from the beginning that you want to be her friend not her carer. It is easy to get drawn in to other people's problems, particularly when you see them struggling alone. You need to decide what you are prepared to give. Will you just want to be some company for her or are you prepared to help her with chores, shopping, trips to the hospital etc?     I suggest you try contacting Age Concern for some advice. They may be able to offer this lady some more support if she is being neglected. You could begin by meeting this lady for a chat when she is out for her walk and then invite her in if she seems happy with it. I hope it works out for you both.|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	Which would you prefer; I wanted to. But one day you see an ambulance pull up and take her away for good. Would you think. Gee, I wish I had been a better neighbor. Or would you rather say, I hoped I was a good friend and visiting with her brightened her life a little.....I know it did mine.|`|DO7lDtqxaa	Please do go and visit with her. I am sure she is terribly lonely.|`|5d93feba60a6599e3f77941fe4be59d6aa	I would if I were you. She will appreciate it I am sure. You could become fast friends. You will probably find she is not as demented as she appears. She is probably just eccentric. I think it will do as much good for you as it will for her !!!  God bless you for your kind heart !!!!|`|bDPU6qWiaa	you have made my day,it is wonderful to know that among the horrible goings on in the world today there are still people like you ready to reach outand give a little kindness,you are one in a million my dear|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Go for it ! it'll be good for everyone involved. Nothing wrong with puttin a little sunshine in the neighborhood.|`|AqLwmafOaa	In sooo many cases... "The Golden Years" is Orwellian double speak for the 'empty years". That no family ever shows up as you mention is all to common. If you have the opportunity and ability to reach out and lighten someones life that otherwise is treading life's path completely alone then I would encourage you to do so. You can just imagine what that would mean to an isolated individual. Warmest wishes and good luck.|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	She obviously craves  a little company and you are just the person. Don't, however, let things get on top of you: visit when you can, but remember that the family are your priority. Involve the children, as it is important for them when growing up to learn to be kind to people in need. Perhaps you could give them a cookery lesson  in things like biscuit/cake making for them to make things to take to her.     I understand that you have misgivings about the children taking money, but she'll want to give them something. I remember turning down money from relatives when I was small because I thought they were hard up and they would be hurt at my rebuff. Teach them some gracious way to deal with this.    Thank God for people like you in the world!|`|p0Czplkkaa	Always respect your elders! Did you ever accept the money? I couldnt really tell from what you wrote (although I'm expecting that you did). You always should take money from the elderly if they want you to, however, because they like giving out their money to a good cause. They figure that they don't have much time left, and they enjoy giving it to the youger generations. When I was in fourth grade, I worked at my church dinner every Thursday. The workers worked for free, and we almost never accepted tips. Now, there was this very elderly man that came through our doors and sat down. Me and my friend waited on him. At the end of his meal, he insisted on giving us a tip. We didn't think we should take it because we didn't think that he should give us his money. We refused, and it just about broke his heart. Luckily, we apoligized and accepted the money just after. Even today, I remember that day and remember to accept money from the older generation!    It was really great that you helped your neighbor- its the right thing to do! (bless you!!)    To answer your question, I really feel that you should visit with her. If I lived alone, I'm sure I'd want some company. You can have her over for dinner, invite her to events and everything! I'm sure she'll really appreciate it- and you'll get a new friend, right across the street.|`|FcZU29W6aa	You sound like a lovely person !!!   I think it would be great if you visited with this lady.  It sounds as though she would really appreciate it.  If she offers you money, you might say "I would feel funny visiting if I took money.  I just really enjoy someone to talk to once in a while since I am at home too."  I think she would really appreciate that.    Plus, if she is a little senile, and tells the same stories, just listen.  She is enjoying herself and you'll feel good about yourself, and your children will too.    It reminds me of a story (true) about a teacher who said she would give the morning off to students who would do a good deed and then share that with the class in the afternoon.  When one boy said he had spent the morning fishing with his grandpa, the teacher said that was nice but what was the good deed?  The boy said I never once said "You already told me that story, Grandpa."  Isn't that sweet?  I think you and your children will bring the same joy to your neighbor.  And what a great lesson you are teaching your children.|`|jkvELDIFaa	What a really nice person you are,, it is very rare in this day and age to find such a caring person. Good on you.|`|eG5W05Pbaa	aw that would be a lovely idea, the love have younger company around them|`|wmBK9uASaa	I think she would appreciate a weekly visit with you and your child, it will give her something to look forward to and as your daughter gets older it will be a good lesson for her to appreciate the older generation in society.....|`|KuWLNfYbaa	It,s difficult if she has dementia because she will be confused about the visit.Try it once and see how it goes,if ok then you will enjoy a few minutes out of the house another time.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Everybody has said every thing that I wanted to say, so I will just say well done to you and your family.  Here is a star, because you are a star!|`|kYYHw7xEaa	Absolutely go!   Maybe take over some homemade soup or something.  What a treat that would likely be.  I would definitely befriend her.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Tis a very good thing that you do.  I would start with some cookies or cakes to break the ice.  I would take smaller portions of whatever I took over. In the elderly I have found that waste is still a huge concern to them.  After you learn her tastes it will be easier to bring other things. Maybe a plate of whatever is for dinner that night. I try my old stand by "I am making meatloaf tonight. Do you like meatloaf. I will bring some over around ______time." Most elderly have the larger meal around noon.  So warmed up left overs are a good idea as well.  Volunteer to go to the store for her.  I have found that when I put out the time for a chat over the back fence over shovel the drive, it is always appreciated. I have become very good at smiling as I listen to life stories over and over, but am able to do so just to see my older neighbors engaged and safe.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	You are an angel.  This old woman is one of the 'deserted' souls that inhabit this cruel world.    It is only because of people like you that they  have a ray of sunshine now and then.    Your children would probably also be a welcome  part of her daily activity if they would want to  carry over little 'treats' for her or even a picture  that they have made for her.    Bless all your hearts!|`|O9FojdEMaa	God will bless you for your efforts. JESUS said the second most important commandment is "Love thy neighbor as thyself. " and he said " I was hungry and you fed me" keep up the good works My Sister in CHRIST.|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Lovely gesture my friend.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	you are a lovely kind person BUT  I'd have a word with the family when they come to visit and let them know what you have in mind, if only to set their minds at rest as you don't know what your neigbour might be telling them. Just take a moment to think about how differently things can look if they innocently get a bit muddled
8b5HhnZTaa	The benefits will be retroactive to the same date as the father's if the father listed him as his child on the claim.  If he did not know how to contact you, SSA could not take your child's claim at that time, but would protect the filing date as long as the father listed him as his child in the claim.  The SSA claims representative would have asked the father whether he had any children who are under 18, age 19 and still in high school, or any age and disabled.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	I doubt they are retroactive.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	based on blue jeans response-    I'm guessing that is the FATHER did not list the child on his claim 2 years ago--the benefits will not be retroactive    It's possible SS screwed up and failed to verify if there were dependents-or just glossed over it-which can easily be missed by soemone who is seriously ill..    is there any possibility the father  willfully left the child off..as some people will do just to 'get back' at the ex    if the father willfully left teh child off-i hope there is somewher you can recover--even if it is jsut a small monetary judgment againsthim--and not the whole amount you lost    if teh givernment screwed up as tehy often do-you are out of lcuk--they consider themselves blameless|`|7BHIyMFmaa	It's not the government's fault that you didn't do your research 3 years ago. I seriously doubt if you're entitled to any back disability benefits.|`|127d772b732ca4f45b50ef7ec289389daa	Your claim is NOT retrospective - BUT what decision did the DWP make on your your partner's claim??? - if your partner was not happy with that decision he had the right to appeal it to a Disability Benefit appeal Tribunal - but he should have done so within 28 of that decision. As that presumably wasn't done your partner is now well out of time to do so now.|`|wFK2vVyHaa	As indicated in other responses, it depends on whether the child was listed on the father's application.  It sounds like they have awarded your child benefits based on the date you filed the application.  So either the father did not list the child and in that case their is nothing that can be done or the claims representative did not retrieve the claim to check it out and is may be paying you incorrectly by not taking the child back to the date the father filed.  This needs to be checked out.  Visit our website at http://www.socialsecurityadviceonline.co... if you would like assistance.

EaurpLufaa	Like I said, he is probably gay and trying to show you signs of his affection.  Sometimes, it's hard to tell a person of the same sex how you feel about him or her.  But no heterosexual male would act this way.  If he engages in very homoerotic activities and conversations with you, he is most likely dropping hints about his true sexuality.  Make the first move, and tell him how you feel.  Good luck.|`|n56YqaMcaa	he is definately gay because im straight and  i know  for a fact that if you touch his *** and he wiggles instead of punching you in the face it means he somehow adores you for some reason

For 2 you need-   one large/medium chicken breast,   2cloves of garlic (or more if you prefer)  a onion (red or white)  mushrooms (optional, but i love them so put **** loads in)  black bean sauce (one sachet or half a jar of them little Sherwood ones)  and soya sauce about 3 tbsp    chop everything how you wish chuck all ingredients in a bowl, best to marinate but i hardly ever do. then chuck in a wok or frying pan and fry it till chicken cooked.    when its nearly done you need some noodles (i use Sherwood edd noodles medium, red pack) 3 layers (they come in layers) for 2 and cook as instructions say need 10mins in boiling water, do not over cook them.     Then strain noodles add the noodles to the pan with ingredients in and add loads of soya sauce on top, i like a lot but about 5 shakes then mix and fry the noodles for about 2mins and its done and taste Delicious!!    takes about 30mins pre and cooking altogether!! enjoy!      well i think your ideas are great wish my man would think like that.  shes a lucky lady and im sure whatever you do she will be happy with you, have fun!!!|`|b7babf309ee4f5ac48cd03b988d87117aa	The link below is to a guide for men called, "Cooking a Romantic Dinner for Two".

It is pretty clear that this and many other questions are asked just to bait people for the entertainment of an internet troll.  However, several people still come charging in ready to fight to defend their beliefs anytime a troll throws one out.      So let me say this: "Atheists and Christians, why do you feel the need to respond in a hate filled manner to a post that is an obvious troll who isn't honestly representing either point of view?"    My recommendation to everyone is to think twice before firing off a knee jerk reactionary response.  Read the post to see if an honest question is there or not.  If there isn't an honest question, but instead a hate filled diatribe is present, then you know you are dealing with an internet troll whose purpose is to rile up people.  It's your right to get unnecessarily riled up as you want, but I personally think you are acting in as foolish a manner as the initial internet troll.

Horus was born from a virgin like jesus and he was called chirst but jesus was called christ and horus was crucified and like ur "jesus" he was brought back to life and horus had 12 diciples like jesus and the bible is BASIC listen to the BASIC instructions before leaving earth he said about creation to explain things to people and christianity was created to keep all religons together and horus was born under the star like jesus and like horus and he was deceneded from royalty just like jesus and horus was almost murdered when he was an infant just like JESUS so you stop wasting ur life, you can belive in god theres nothing wrong with that but dude ur O.T.T. no offense btw you sterotizing us atheists is like rasicism so techniqually u are a rasicist so in the end whoose really going to hell?|`|vWbbNd6Baa	You're not going to rot in hell either.

G9R6VZOXaa	I'm not American, so it doesn't directly affect me, so please feel free to tell me to butt-out.    However, as an outsider looking in (and as a gay man) I did think it was strange and am inclined to agree with you      In the UK, we got the Civil Partnership Act through on the basis of it providing beneficial rights to same sex couples, rather than having the spin of achieving somekind of equality.    I think America missed a trick and got it slightly wrong.  You were taking on establilshed religion and people's opinion, rather than what gay people actually needed.    I guess I'm very lucky that my Lesbians and Gays in my country now have the equality that you are looking for.  Only, it was so much easier to get here and I really don't understand why.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Nobody hating us? Then why are there still so many crimes committed against us because of who we are?

I would call drama getting all worked up about the Supreme Court allowing people to get married, so much so that you have to collect signatures to take that right away and set up a campaign to get their marriage rights annulled.     I would call drama claiming that your marriage is going to suddenly be meaningless, that fire will rain down from the sky and we'll all go to hell if you let people in committed relationships get married.     That's what I would call drama.     Protesting your rights being taken away I don't see as drama, to be honest. But that's just me. You may have a different opinion of what drama is.|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	Obviously u r not gay! you would never understand the **** we go thru! we are hated on everyday! not having equal rights is hate in itself looser!|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Proposition 8 was not banned because of hatred.

It really keeps people in the dark, and there's nothing more the Religious Right would like better than to relive the Dark Ages, or the medieval ones, when politics took a backseat to religious powers.    Wait, that's happening now. Gosh, darn it.|`|AA10663644	I guess the drama stemmed from the fact that we had confidence in the people of California to do what is right, and not let the hatred -- YES it IS hate! -- decide an issue that takes away human and civil rights.    By the way, equality IS the core issue!|`|H2IqzG12aa	I think they were taken by surprise by the outcome.  On the surface, it seemed to be about gay-bashing, not letting them share the pie, and most polls show that most people support gays in general.  Neither side has yet taken a detached, non-paranoid view of the implications and consequences (or lack thereof) of accepting or banning gay marriage and the other side's motivations.  So far it's all been about rhetoric and not about facts.

Z391sLTcaa	Good question,  and to all the christians, (im catholic also) the devil didnt inspire this question god did as he gave us the ability think, to ask and understand, jesus also encouraged people to ask questions, and not to just blindly follow your faith without keeping your own mind free.    In many ways this guy is right to ask because trully no one does actually know, the truth is the bible wasnt written by the hand of god, it was written by men. and the first of these were  the romans, its also worth noting that constantine refused to change to christianity even after forcing everyone else to adopt the new religion, anyway this is a side issue.    It is also worth noting that in the old testament, god is not a very nice character at all, and there is a lot of contradictions, even at the very start of man, with adam and eve story, now here is the truth of this,, the devil/satan is accused of being a deciever and a liar, okay well in the garden of eden GOD told eve that if she eat from the tree of life that on that day she would die, later the devil told her that is not true, eat from it and you will live he told her god had lied to them, she eat the apple, yet eve did not die, SATAN here had told the truth,GOD did not, also in the eden story we are told they were the first created humans, and were kept innocent and separete from the outside world, the devil told them that there was more to the world than they had been shown, Satan also attacks gods policy of forcing them to obey the demands he laid on them, without actualy telling them why or giving them a choice, he argued for their right to choose there own path, and that god was a tyrant with an over stretched ego. Anyway later we know they had children kane and able, two brothers, and that they got wives ( what wives) yes funnily enough there were other tribes of humans around then, even though adam and eve were apparently the first, someone had been telling Porkies here.    Am gonna cut it short now, but there are many ways of interpreting this, 1) GOD in the old testament wasnt a nice character, he was egotistical, destructive, he played mind games, (forcing a man to take his son to sacrifice, to show his devotion),  and was very much a dictator, and that Satan on the other hand believed in liberty, freedom to choose your own path, right or wrong, and was truthful, despite his reasons........2) GOD has the right to dominate and make us bend to whatever will he decides and if we dont then we deserve to be killed, and that the devil was wrong to try to break this relationship. if you agrree with this one then i suppose its the reason the inquisition was justified aswell as religious laws, and you would believe democracy is wrong,.. jesus also must have disagreed with the old testament god as he believed in peace and treating others the way you would like to be treated... it makes you wonder what was going on in the old testament with what appeared to be a flesh and blood god, who mingled with men.    am not saying that it was written by god or the devil as in my opinion it was written by the hand of MAN and was used as a means to control the masses, however i do believe in christ but i wouldnt take everything in the bible, koran, tora etc etc etc as complete truths, KEEP AN OPEN MIND PEOPLE!!|`|1UokhVRXaa	not possible.

vf9g9bExaa	Hera is an Olympian, the third daughter of Kronus and Rhea, and sister to Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Demeter and Hestia.  She is Zeus's second wife (the rules are not the same for mortals and immortals when it comes to marrying in the family).  They had a 300 year honeymoon.  Hera is considered the most beautiful of all the Greek Goddesses.      Hera is queen of the gods and the goddess of women and marriage, oaths, and a Goddess associated with childbirth. She is also a goddess of the sky and starry heavens.  She is usually depicted as a beautiful woman wearing a crown and holding a royal, lotus-tipped staff. Sometimes she held a royal lion or had a cuckoo, hawk, cow, or peacock as her familiar.  The crow and the pomegranate (symbol of marriage) are also dedicated to her.  It is said that each year Hera's virginity returns by bathing in the well Canathus.     The children of Hera and Zeus are the smith-god Hephaestus (though some myths say Hera was the sole parent of him to show she too could procreate alone as Zeus did with Athena), the goddess of youth Hebe, the god of war Ares, and Eileithyia (the Goddess of Childbirth).    According to Homer, Hera was jealous and vindictive when it came to Zeus' affairs with immortals and mortals alike.  There are legends of her punishing the women even if they fought against Zeus' advancements.  I personally think these instances merely reflect the male dominance of the era and the attempts to make everything female subject to male.    Hera was sided with the Greeks in the Trojan war (due to Paris not picking her in a contest) and was the benefactress of Jason and the Argonauts.

In case you don't live together, give your beloved a good morning call to wake him/her up. Plan beforehand as to when and how are you going to spend time together. You can either tell your partner about the plans or keep it as a surprise. If you want to keep it as a surprise, make sure your partner does not have any other official priorities.     Plan a nice cozy place for lunch. Make sure you book your table in advance as most eating joints run packed on Valentines Day. You wouldn't want to stand in a long queue and make your loved one moan and complain. You can catch up on a nice movie before or after your lunch.

It generally consists of a small ring of onion dipped in batter or bread crumbs and then deep fried. The result varies from restaurant to restaurant. The ring-like structure of an onion lends itself well to this mode of preparation.    The exact origin of the onion ring is unknown, but in 1933 a recipe for deep-fried onion rings that are dipped in milk then dredged in flour appeared in a Crisco advertisement in The New York Times Magazine.[1]    [edit] Variants    * Tobacco ring - very thin, crisp onion rings named for their color  * Blooming onion - a whole onion that is cut into a flower shape that fans out  * Onion loaf - a rectangular structure of onion rings fried together  * Texas Toothpicks - strips of onions and strips of jalape?os battered and fried. Served in a basket together with ranch dressing.    [edit] References    1. ^ "Crisco Advertisement", The New York Times Magazine: SM18, November 5, 1933, http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.h... Cut large onions into slices about ? inch thick. Separate slices into rings. Dip rings into milk. dredge with flour.  Fry onion rings until brown.

God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good thing s that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understands this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.  Muslims don't deny Jesus, they believe in him, love him and respect him so much.  We believe Jesus is NOT dead till today; he wasnt murdered or crucified as most people think. God made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth, make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter and perform his last prayer before he really dies like other Prophets. So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|uymZEWp6aa	dont just believe him blindly,as god helps those who help themselves so do whatever u can nd then go to him.if he doesnt helps u still ,dont think that he's not right,may be that sumtime u have only done wrong nd he's washing all ur paaps so that u can take birth without any sins next time|`|R26OBoW7aa	Miracles are just coincidences or conjunctures. We always listen about miracles happening in the believers life ! Miracles can be best explained as some people are at the right place at the right time.    Why don't miracles happen when hundreds of people pray to God in a hijacked plane ? Why didn't the tsunami rolled back when people prayed to God for their lives ? Why didn't miracles happen when the tornado Katrina hit the US coast ? Why dint miracles happen when criminals kill innocent people in cold blood ? Why don't miracles happen when people die of poverty, disease, accidents, wars ?    Miracles have been institutionalised purposely and more or less it has been fed in to our psych and belief system so that the Theists have their way.

GIRE9F45aa	Scientology is a dangerous cult, and there isn't really much substance to their beliefs.  They publicly pay lip service to a higher power, but inside their buildings, you won't find any mention of a God or prayer, only a lot of portraits of founder L. Ron Hubbard.  He is virtually deified, and they believe that only through his teachings does humanity have a chance to save itself from destruction.    They claim compatibility with other, real religions.  However, this is only a PR spin to make them appear more attractive.  For example, Scientology teaches reincarnation and that people's souls are trillions of years old, while Christians believe we have one life on earth.  And Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard said that "There was no Christ" and that modern-day religions are the result of alien implants.    One of the first things members do are some very strange "communications courses," which involve forms of hypnosis and are moderately expensive.  Things get progressively more intense from there.  At the highest levels, they teach that people's problems are caused by alien parasites.  They sell courses costing thousands of dollars and are very aggressive at getting people's money.    They are also violently opposed to psychiatry, viewing it as an evil conspiracy to drug people up, control them, and ruin their lives.  (Think of the Tom Cruise outbursts on the Today Show and against Brooke Shields.)  And they have a number of dangerous medical opinions, such as treating virtually everything with vitamin megadoses well beyond toxic levels.    Scary stuff!|`|CB15kchkaa	That's a very good point and you'll also notice that no one ever criticises their technology, even those who leave it and turn against it.  Scientology started as an exploration of the mind. Dianetics the modern science of mental health looked at the requirements of an optimum mind then defined sanity. It then looked at all the reasons why such a perfect 'computer' so often messes up and went on to discover the causes. Basically dianetics shows the failings and dangers of psychiatry and offers a much more logical alternative.   Incidentally, the discovery of fundamental truths in dianetics created the neccessity to investigate life further, beyond the realm of the mind. When people using dianetic technques started recalling things from previous lives, it was necessaary to investigate this phenomena further.  The religion of scientology is based on the findings of this investigation.  The simple answer is that scientologists consider themselves a sister religion to buddhism, nothing is faith based but is focused on developing each and everyones highest potential.  It's a very interesting religion, it's quite absorbing, and it's extremely effective.  If you were to consider that you had a previous life, then in that previous life, you had a previous life. How far back could you go as a spiritual being, and what would be at the beginning? That's what scientology is all about!|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	They will tell you that its a 'New' religion which helps you to live your life better through taking courses which only they provide. That's the hook, self improvement.    Then it gets very weird. This is not a joke read the link.    All our problems are caused by things called Thetans not just phisical illness but negative thoughts and mental illness. Scientology can cure you of these Thetans using a process called 'Auditing' (basically telling them all your secrets which are filed away for future reference) and an 'E meter' which is a glorified electrical capacitor.    They profess to have no problem with anyone from another religion becoming a scientologist, BUT in reality they believe that people believe in other religions because of the influence of Thetans and will try to cure them of it.    Right this is the big Secret where do Tetans come from? L Ron Hubbard, the former science fiction author and founder of Scientology, discovered in a drug crazed haze in the 60's that Thetans are the souls of an alien species massacred here on earth billions of years ago by an intergalactic warrior called Xenu. He brought them to earth on space plane, which looked remarkably like a DC airliner, gathered them around volcanoes and destroyed them by exploding Hydrogen bombs in the volcanoes. This is known as the 'wall of fire' incident, if you look on the front of Dienetics you will see a volcano.  Xenu captured the souls of these murdered aliens and programmed them in cinemas then released them where they cause all our problems.  All these courses and auditing are very expensive, the more you take the higher up the hiarchy you rise until at OTIII (operating thetan level 3) they reveal the Xenu story. It is estimated to cost $300,000 to reach OTIII    They are a vast money making cult who are responsible for several unexplained deaths, and many people leave the 'church' fleeced of money and dignity.    Edit  Nathan comparing the wonderful writings of Jules Verne with L Ron is symptomatic of the delusional nature that Scientology instills. L Ron was crap science fiction author, just like he was a crap officer in the navy, where his commanding officer described him as dilusional, and more dangerous to his own side than the Japanese (despite which Scientology still portray him as some wonder hero even though he never encountered any Japanese)    Edit  Oh the good old fall back position, 'if you haven't studied it you can't possibly know'. Tell me have you ever murdered anyone? If not, does that mean you should never sit on a jury judging someone in a murder trial? Your argument is nonsense, ofcourse people who look at the scripture can make decisions about whether it is nonsense. The problem with Scientology is that unlike mainstrem religions they keep their Dogma secret, so anyone studying it is not able to find out exactly what it is they believe in without either paying the fee, or discovering it from ex members.  Or from court documents lodged in Holland where scientology made the mistake of suing ex scientologists without realising that Dutch laws are different to the U.S. and that they had to lodge documents in the court which showed that what the Ex scientologists where accusing them of was true.    Edit  I see Nathan, so now anyone who disagrees with Scientology is silly. I know what the Questioner asked, thats why I answered. Tell me if someone came on here asked about Heavens Gate should no one would tell them that, actually they are waiting for little green men to whisk them of to some galactic nirvana once they commit communal suicide? This is the problem with scientology, it will not tell anyone what its about until they start paying, they wont answer questions directly without offering a personality test which, guess what, always discovers problems that only Scientology can cure. For a price of course.    One of the recognisable criteria of a cult is that they develop their own specific language, this is not new neither is it specific to Scientology. Rather then using it to excuse Scientology Nathan, the fact that they develop a specific language should ring alarm bells in anyone asking for information about any group.    From Liftons eight criteria for thought reform    Loading the Language.  The group interprets or uses words and phrases in new ways so that often the outside world does not understand.  This jargon consists of thought-terminating clichs, which serve to alter members' thought processes to conform to the group's way of thinking.    As for the rest of your edit. Its gobbledygook, and psychobabble, its meaningless nonsense, anyone who has not been exposed to the influence of the group just shakes their head incomprehensibly. However anyone who has any understanding of how a cult works knows that its a classic example of Liftons criteria above.    And apart from on planet L Ron, when did Enturbulate become a word?    I have not linked to any anti-scientology site Nathan, I campaign against cults. Because they all operate in the same way they are easy to spot once you know what to look for. I do not need to link to any higher authority, I prefer to tell people to look at the facts and make up their own minds, you cant have any problem with that can you Nathan?    You are saying that Scientology is not a cult because you have studied the scripture, but Nathan how do you know they are not a cult without finding out how a cult works? There is much more information about cults on the net than there is about Scientologys beliefs; cults all operate in the same way, thats why its relatively easy to recognise them. Find out about cults Nathan, then you may be in a position to judge whether Scientology really is a cult.    |`|HTXsEms9aa	you really don't want to know  just ask John T if you do|`|xxEhpytpaa	It's a big secret. They probably have wild parties and follow that lunatic Earl Ron Hubbard (what ever his name is) who wrote the book. Any way these celebrities have money to spend. Wished I had written it I would be sitting pretty right now, enjoying all the donations. God bless you.|`|AA11972123	All you need to know is that L Ron Hubbard was a science fiction writer, which would explain the ultimate revelation in Scientology, that humans are infested with millions of alien "thetans" from the planet Xenu.  This is revealed, after many thousands of dollars to "get clear", and leaving complete common sense behind.|`|AA10985325	Heres a factual description for you (From a Scientologist):    Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By applied is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .  The dictionary definition that applies:    Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.    The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless made good.    The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individuals understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .    How this result is achieved is the technology of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .  Scientologys closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.    L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this.   He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientologys Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.    The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.  2. People find it interesting.  3. People find it works.  4. People pass it along to others.  5. It grows.    This is just an overview.  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures. So its not possible to fully answer your question on this forum, but I hope  this helps.|`|tbjujTjsaa	They believe God is really a turnip that lives on the planet zenon and will one day travel to the Earth in a flying saucer grow roots in your head and turn everyone into Jesus|`|6VFDoSrjaa	Seems to me that their belief is in their own publicity

(And lets just say he wasn't too active.)|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No, they're not.  They must be baptized before they can.  http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/4673|`|GPn55rjTaa	Yes.  I went to one last year.  Does not matter if the member is not attending church.  The Bishop can and will still perform the ceremony.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	yes, absolutely, just have to speak to the Bishop first.|`|TzY9vkinaa	yup. It's only the Temple they're really picky about.|`|xyIZv6iiaa	My brother did - but that's been quite a while ago.......|`|AA10637643	Anyone can get married in a Mormon church, members or not.  It is definitely fine.    Speak with the bishop you want to marry the two of you and it will all work out.  Expect a little bit of counsel - on the gospel.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Of course. No problem. I knew a sister in my ward before our ward split that was married to a non-member who was an atheist. I can't remember if she was inactive when she married him, but not really the point. The bishop will do it as he has the civil authority to do it.     But the answers are correct about the bishop's council on the gospel as most Bishops really hope that their members will try and work to live up to the standard of a marriage for time and all eternity within the temple.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	You don't need to hope that he'll do it, he'll do it.    It doesn't matter if he's active or not a member or anything like that.  Your bishop would be happy to help.|`|q0gRmHlUaa	Yes in the chapel but not in the temple.|`|AA10358331	Yes!|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Any bishop would be able to answer that question with certainty.  I know that LDS Bishops can marry any two people.  I believe that any two people can get married in an LDS chapel as long as they have the Bishop's approval, no matter what religion they belong to.      You can have wedding ceremonies in LDS chapels.      Hope this helped.....and Congratulations to the happy couple!|`|8Ak1FehYaa	I was married by my army reserved CPT (Chaplin) who was mormon in my ward to my nonmember husband who was in my reserve unit, so I don;t see why not. The marriage ended a year later unfortunely.|`|8jhACvtlaa	Yeah sure.  I saw it happen a few times on my mission.  Just talk to the Bishop.    EDIT:  One I saw was a less-active sister (who was trying to be more active) married to a guy who wasn't a member at the time.    Other times, it was 2 people who weren't members at the time, but were taking the missionary lessons, although I doubt that's a requirement for it.    I would just ask the Bishop, I'm sure he'd be willing to help out.|`|lRaxAWfRaa	Who cares?  They don't believe in Jesus' grace|`|33da46689f71e3eadb10cf78c75d6b2caa	I am sure if they contact the bishop they will be able to marry in the chapel.  When my husband and I were looking for places, (he was an inactive member and I was not a member) the chapel was one of the suggestions his mom had.  She wouldn't have said anything if it weren't possible for us to marry in the chapel, by the Bishop.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Yes.  I've had a couple of friends who chose to have their weddings to non-members in the chapel.  It shouldn't be a problem.|`|hg8ufwM1aa	Absolutely, it doesn't matter if they are members or not.  However, the Bishop may try to council them to get married by their own Minister if possible, only because they might be more at ease in their own Church.  However, they would not be married in our Chapel, but would be married in our cultural hall, which is part of our same building, but just next to the Chapel.  And it's free!  Our Bishop will not accept any money for this service.  We do not have any paid ministry in the LDS Church.   whew6

As for dreams in particular alot of things come into play here. First off, Do you have alot of stress in your life? Second get a check up.    I was having dreams about storms. Turns out I was alot sicker than I thought. I had 2 surgeries in one year, both for the same thing. After the second one I didn't have any more dreams about storms.    If it is God, listen to him and read between the lines.|`|eHUJOD0daa	To dream that God speaks to you, signifies feelings of guilt, eternal punishment, and damnation.  To dream about the death of a loved one, suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances.  To see an ascending balloon in your dream, signifies frustrating conditions in your life in which you are seeking to rise above. You are expressing a desire to escape. On a positive note, balloons symbolize celebration and festivities. You need to acknowledge your inner child.|`|YsYq7BJzaa	he is trying 2 tell u don't hold on 2 ur mother forever u need 2 let her go and ur uncle is going to live u need 2 know him more he's the only other person thats closer 2 her

Theism is the belief in a god that's  what "the" means, god. so a theist would be   someone who has a religion that believes in a  "god" like christian or muslim. Atheist means   no god. "A" mean not. like Biotic is alive, Abiotic   is not alive,. get it? Atheists don't believe in god.  and they don't think they're any better. Though  some may think they're smarter for not believing   in a magic fairy tale that some people base their   lives off of. you should be a good person for the  sake of being a good person. not for some great  reward when you die. Agnostic is pretty much like  saying, "I can't prove that there is, or isn't a god,   and neither can you." Atheism is like, "There is no god."|`|RedEGIfZaa	I do not believe that there *is* a God.    Strong atheists claim that God does not exist.  Most atheists, like myself, are weak atheists.  We simply lack any belief in God because there is no evidence to support the claim that he exists.      Addendum: A weak agnostic claims that they do not know if God exists or not.  A strong agnostic claims that knowing whether God exists or not is inherently impossible.    A person can be either type of agnostic and a weak atheist at the same time.  I happen to be a weak atheist and a weak agnostic.

To me, belief is just a matter of honesty.  You believe something or you don't -- it doesn't make you better than somebody else.    What makes you better than somebody else is how you treat them, how you comport yourself.  For instance, you going around always having to challenge people who believe something different than you do makes you inferior to me.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	No.  I do not believe in a god.

Polytheism means believing in many Gods, monotheism (which is what you clearly believe) means there is one God. Atheism means that there is no God.   That's what atheist should believe due to the linguistics. People who tell you that you are stupid because of your beliefs are not atheists, they are dickheads. Questions of personal religion are, as said, personal.     I am also an atheist, but I don't expect others to agree with me. Also, I don't want other people telling me what to believe. Therefore - nobody is better than anyone else just because of their beliefs.|`|YegFsJyhaa	I am not any better or worse than people who believe or even those who don't believe.

Disbelief without evidence is skepticism,  not faith.    Do you believe that fairies exist?  If not, does your not believing in them count as a religious faith? After all, nobody has actually proved they don't exist.  Do you think everyone should believe in fairies because there existence has not been disproven?    I don't believe that a single all powerful, eternal entity is a logical proposition.  The central character of the old testament certainly doesn't sound like any kind of deity to me.

It's spelled 'atheists', and yes, I do.    > If so, how are you any better than others who believe in God?    Because my belief that God does not exist is based on logic and evidence, whereas most people's beliefs in God are based on faith and have nothing to do with logic or evidence. Not all beliefs are equally valid.    >a philosophy professor once told me that the difference between agnosticism and atheism is that atheism is still a faith based position    That is incorrect. The actual difference is that atheists positively assert the nonexistence of God, whereas agnostics have not made a decision as to whether God exists or not.    >However, what many people fail to realize is that in this day and age, not following the flock is what's mainstream.    Not really. The flock is just moving in different directions than it used to.    That said, as a rationalist I'm not simply against doing what other people do, what I'm against is doing what other people do for no other reason than that they do it. I would be perfectly satisfied if everyone (including me) held the same beliefs, SO LONG AS those beliefs were based on logic and evidence. On the other hand, faith is never a good thing in itself regardless of how many, or how few, people happen to have it.|`|ZRtnCFU3aa	1.

mxIYhkAnaa	you must ask yourself, do i need hookah? In my eyes, everytime one person asks is this haraam, i see one person that is begging for a answer that makes haraam halaal. Allaahu alim if that is your case. But you should ask yourself, do i really need this? It is like asking is the meat of crocodile halaal? Ya Allaah. Brings Hookah you closer to Allaah? No, than it is at least makrooh. And what makrooh is should be avioded if you can not aviod it, there is no sin upon you. Insha Allaah.     Don't do as Sufi do, invent new ways to become closer to Allaah. If you want to enjoy hookah, just say i do this because of my nafs. If you want to become closer to Allaah, seek Him in every step you take, by staying away from haraam and makrooh. Hookah and shishah are one of those things that are combined with other sins, like mixing the two genders (non family), music, gossip, looking at girls (belly dancing).. There will be no benefit for you (mentally/ emaan and physical), so better to stay away. As i read that hubble bubble pipes are haraam to sell or to buy, makes it also haraam to enjoy it.

Don't you set down on the steps  'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.  Don't you fall now --  For I'se still goin', honey,  I'se still climbin',  And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.

We hold to the following statements of faith:   We Believe the Bible is the inspired and only infallible authoritative written Word of God.     We Believe there is one God, eternally existent in the three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.     We Believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, in His personal future return to this earth in power and glory to rule a thousand years.     We Believe in the Blessed Hope - - the rapture of the church at Christ's coming.     We Believe the only means of being cleansed from sin is through repentance and faith in the precious blood of Christ.     We Believe regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential for personal salvation.     We Believe the redemptive work of Christ on the cross provides healing of the human body in answer to believing power.     We Believe the baptism in the Holy Spirit, according to Acts 2:4, is given to believers who ask for it.     We Believe in the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a holy life.     We Believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost, the one to everlasting life and the other to everlasting damnation.

The big picture is that I recognize exactly two independent and mutually irreducible deities, who are sometimes perceived to be complementary and sometimes perceived to be in conflict.  The universe is the product of their eternal dance; they turn and turn until they "turn into one".  2. Nothing does, as I feel truth is subjective.  That which makes sense to me won't necessarily make sense to someone else.  The opposite applies, as well.  3. No, since I generally observe a personal doctrine of silence, nobody really knows my beliefs.  I obfuscate and misdirect when the subject presents itself.  Most people, including family, just think I'm atheist.  I'm not out to convert anyone.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	I don 't think we can inherit something that's already ours.    What we can do is claim it, participate in it consciously, or decide not to.  The same with salvation.  Since Jesus was resurrected, it's there waiting for us to claim or not.  "Saved" is a meaningless word to me.|`|64eba52b7a7dcdb30b1e7b1223d7eb33aa	Yes and no......if you are saved it means you are eligible to behave yourself as a citizen of the universe.....every country you go to on earth has requirements for you to enter that country.....its the same for heaven.......as for inheritance it says the the meek shall inherit the earth and other types shall inherit other things.....yes there is going to be a wild inheritance party......yoohooo!!!|`|FBrwlhPtaa	They go hand-in-hand.|`|c3zUqmdXaa	Man, OBVIOUSLY that's the same. Jesus said he will say to us: "Com, wel-said of my Father. Take as inheritance the kingdom that is prepared for you from the foundation of the world". Paul said we are are heir of God and co-heir of Christ. Salvation is our inheritance.|`|i48kxrbaaa	I am not sure if I am absolutely correct, but from what i've learned, you can be saved, and not inherit the the kingdom.    But, to inherit the kingdom, you must be saved.    I could be wrong, who knows. This is what I learned in bible study.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	You can be saved but not get much or any rewards in heaven.     Salvation is by faith alone in Jesus without works.  Rewards are by works.  There are believers that will be in heaven but won't get much or any rewards in heaven.|`|WiTBXCYvaa	Inheriting the Kingdom is the result of salvation. Just like if you ride a motorcycle, your a biker; If you accept a gift, you receive whatever comes in the package/box/bag.    I don't believe that inheriting the Kingdom is the same as salvation, because salvation is being saved from death, hell, and the grave. If your in a war and you get injured (on your way to death) and another soldier saves you, drags you on the chopper, and gets you back to base to be saved, you might get an award for being injured in the line of duty, but that's the result of what you did, The only difference is that comes with a price to pay: injury. With salvation, Jesus took the injury and gives you the results free if you accept it.    UPDATE:  I see people disagree with me, however, the Kingdom is another way of saying Heaven! If your saved and you don't go to hell, then your going to heaven and that will be where you will stay. I understand where most of you are coming from with the idea that works are what get you more treasures in heaven, but you can't deny that if your saved, you inherit heaven as your new home.    Yeah, you might not get as big of a mansion as someone else, but you will inherit that as your new home. Don't be fooled though. Being a good person doesn't get you "things" in heaven. Following Christ without waivering does. The works are only what people see here. God looks at whats in your heart! There will be christians that barely make it into heaven because they were saved but didn't spread the gospel and reach people. They will stand before God ad be told they could have saved some lives.

Just like Lord Caitanya is manifesting that spiritual frustration. "Oh Krsna, I could not see You." He's jumping on the sea in frustration. But that frustration is the highest perfection of love. Yes. Everything is there. But without inebriety. You are very intelligent boy. I thank you. Yes. Yes. There is frustration, but not this frustration. Yes. That frustration, I mean to say, enriches one's eagerness of love for Krsna. Everything is there, but without inebriety. Everything is there. Yes. Now see, Visnu? Of course, in Vaikuntha-jagat there is no violence. But Visnu is taking the symbol of violence. Otherwise what is the meaning of this disc and club? So when He wants to be violent, He comes here as Nrsimha-murti. (laughter) And He sends some of His devotees to play violence. That is Hiranyakasipu. Because there the devotees are so much in accord with Krsna and Visnu that there is no question of disagreement. But violence is when this disagree-ment, atheist. Therefore sometimes a devotee is deputed in this world to play as atheist, and Krsna comes to kill him. To teach these people that "If you become atheist, then here is disc and club for you." But it is not possible to be displayed in the Vaikuntha. Otherwise, if there is no the propensity of violence... Just like there is sometimes mock fight. A father is fighting in mock with a small child, and he has become defeated. But there is pleasure. So anandamayo 'bhyasat. The Lord is joyful. So there is joy in fighting also sometimes. So your question that everything is there, that is a fact. Everything is there. Otherwise if everything is not there, they cannot be manifested here because it is reflection. Just like in... Of course, this discovery is by the Vaisnava, Gaudiya Vaisnava. Just like the love between Radha and Krsna, it is called parakiya. They are not married husband and wife. But Radharani appears to be wife of some other gentleman. But Krsna, from childhood, They were friends. So Radharani could not forget Krsna. She used to come to Krsna and stand like that. That's all. And He was playing. Kisora-Kisori, They were boy and girl. But there is no inebriety. Just like here the boy and girls mix and there are so many abominable things. Distressful, which is binding their material bondage. So that friendship between boy and girl is there, but without inebriety. Krsna had so many gopis, girlfriend, but there was no contraceptive pills. (laughter) That is the beauty. Here, the so-called love is lust. And there, that is the highest. The same thing, obverted, perverted reflection. Just like in the original tree the topmost part has come down to the down. Similarly, in the spiritual world the highest, topmost level of love, parakiya... Parakiya means love not by marriage life, by friendship. That is there. But there is no such inebriety. It is pure. So perverted means the topmost thing has come down to the lowest. Here, this parakiya, loving other's wife or other's husband, is most abominable, adultery. Not allowed by society, not allowed by the state. But tendency is there. Even one is married, he wants to love another's wife. Or if the girl married (s)he wants to love another husband. Why? That is there. But without inebriety. That is the beauty. So everything is there, but here, that thing is reflected, pervertedly. Therefore misunderstood. There is so many other corollaries. You see? But you must know everything, that without being in the Absolute Truth there cannot be relative manifestation. This world is relative manifestation. So these things are not to be understood in the beginning, but as the questions came we discussed something. But you must know, as the Vedanta-sutra says, janmady asya yatah. Everything is emanated from that Absolute Truth. That is the fountainhead of everything. We cannot manufacture anything. It is not possible. But this is shadow and that is reality. And in the shadow... Just like photograph. You find that everything in detail of your beautiful face in the photograph, but that is not reality. That's all. So you'll find everything in details, all... Or you can understand actual photograph, actual idea, actual notion of the spiritual world by scrutinizingly studying this material world. The impersonalists, they think that in the material varieties there are so many abominable inebrieties, therefore in the spiritual world all these things should be minus, void. That is their material calculation. They cannot think that in the spiritual world also there is love. Because here, in this world, the so-called love or lust is frustrated and followed by so many calamities that therefore they cannot conceive that in the spiritual world also there is love. Their idea, in one sense, is right, that how these nonsensical things can exist in the spiritual world? Therefore they make it altogether minus. No variety. Impersonal. That is less intelligence. They cannot understand that photograph is the reflection of the actual person. There is everything in detail. A movie. Actually, the same man is laughing, walking, dress, everything, but it is all false. That they cannot understand. Therefore the Vaisnavas say they are less intelligent. The real understanding should be that if in the real person all these features are not present, how they can be reflected in the photograph? The Mayavadi says, brahma satyam jagan mithya. Brahman, the Absolute Truth, is real truth, and this world is mithya. Then mithya means it is a reflection or shadow. Mithya does not mean that it has no existence. The shadow is also existence. Therefore Vaisnava philosophers say that mithya means temporary. Now you have got this body. This is temporary. That's the real understanding. And if I say it is mithya, then if I kill you, then why I am punished? I can say, "Oh, it is mithya, it is false. So what is their fault?"

It's beyond sad, and nobody is addressing this problem very effectively.  There is still a strong attitude among minorities that education is for "white people" and welfare is the only possible fate for them if they aren't white.    I have no idea what can be done about it.  You're right -- the welfare system is ridiculous.

Basically, nobody who can take care of themselves should get a free ride, ever.  It's no good for the person, and it's no good for the society.

Baby making machines, and the sperm donor MUST be held responsible....  You must remember that many churches push for procreation...Just look at Utah that has a very high rate of babies per family.

I was kicked out of my home at 15 and missed all of my GCSE exams, i was homeless for a few weeks then i moved into a hostel at 16. I started receiving state benefits to pay for accommodation and food.     The support the state has given me has completely turned my life around, i have retaken all of my GCSE's and started my AS levels in physics, maths, psycology and chemistry. When i tell people that i am technically homeless and dependant on the state most are shocked, they kind of assume people on state benefits are stupid i can assure you i am top of the class.     To stop stupid people having kids is just insane, to stop welfare is just as dumb, otherwise i would simply turn into a stupid man pumping out the kids like the ones you so hate. What needs to happen is better policing of it to make sure no one is abusing it, more government initiatives to increase employment opportunities and better education on contraception.

Have a great day!|`|wzU9VUt2aa	Depends on the age at which they tell me. I feel your sexuality is uncertain until a specific age. People that say they knew they were gay at..oh..age 5 seem to be full of crap.    Side note -- Anyone who adds the phrase, "It's not my life to control" is lying. Parents are there to control their children.    "As long as he is happy,I would support him 100%" -- Phrases such as this, as well. If your child were a drug addict, you would not support him.

So if my child told me he or she was attracted to his or her own gender, I'd be all right with that.      The same rules apply to homosexual relationships as apply to heterosexual ones.  Don't get sick, don't get pregnant (ok, maybe that's not such an issue) respect your partner and his or her choices.  As long as there's mutual love and respect between my children and their partners, the gender of those partners matters not a whit to me.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	They would still be my child, and my love for them would not change. I would pray for them along the lines of what i perceive to be their greatest need, knowing that God is in control always. Only God can change a person's heart, so trying to convince someone in sin that they are in a bad place and should change directions is fruitless, unless you are dealing with a christian who KNOWS that they are in sin, and in that case, there is a strong sense of guilt and shame that accompanies the sin. If that child experiences no guilt or shame before God, then I would be praying for their salvation...as that would be the most obvious need.|`|AA11864826	As an atheist, I don't see any reason to think less of people based on what they do with their naughty bits.

I have no idea how I would react, right at that moment.      It's not likely that I would burst into tears or start yelling, but beyond that this isn't a what-if scenario that has an easy answer. If it happens, then I'll know.  Hopefully my child and I would have long established a relationship of openness, honesty and love that would get us past the initial "moment".      I can think of a lot of things an adult child would do that I wouldn't necessarily approve of, but after a certain point my approval isn't a factor. I do know this: About the only reason I can think of to actually bar the door of my home to a child, though not without regret and heartache, is if he/she has an out-of-control drug problem.  I couldn't conceive of doing the same if he/she came out to me as gay; it seems to me that the door (literally and otherwise) needs to be open then more than ever.|`|AA11521494	I expect a parent would have a hard time not continuing to love their child whatever, but I can't help thinking that preaching to them that they are congenitally sick because god says so, which is what some of these answers are saying, is likely to drive them away as soon as they possibly can.  If you are a Christian family, surely they already know that and the last thing they need is being reminded at a time when they have plucked up the courage to actually tell you, knowing what you think about it.  Your son or daughter will have already mentally been through hell, so to speak, getting to the point of making that admission.  (If nothing else this should prove that being homosexual is not a choice.)|`|8DRzJEfpaa	Sorry Gurl...you are going to HELL, were your withering & squirming body is going to be used over & over again by packs of demonic Wienerdogs...till the end of time...!    sorry...|`|Cqr1sffjaa	This is a tough question:  I would love my child and continue to love the time we had but I would seriously consider kicking them out.  If they were already out, disown, probably.    EDIT- I suppose I would pray for them and hope they wake up and leave such flagrancy behind.    EDIT- I realize I will get a lot of thumbs down but let's be serious, if homosexuality is a sickness then there is a cure and nobody wants to remain ill.  If it is a genetic mutation, how are we gonna take them seriously, you do not see down-syndrom children or autistics in high level positions in the community.    Now, for a moment, forget scripture, homosexuality is a scientific and evolutionary conundrum which pecks away at the very fiber and survival of our species.|`|TpkRuXyMaa	Well, if I didn't accept, i'd be a hypocrite, lol.

I'm Christian. Love supersedes everything.|`|KszocgnSaa	I would support them. This isn't my normal section but sometimes I come around here.... I would idk help them accept them self. Lots of gay Christians have trouble with being gay. If our church did not accept them... well then I probably wouldn't go there but I could bring them to an accepting church.   Anyway just thought I would add this since a few answers pissed me off. This one person started off I would love them then went on to say I would disown them its a disease. Just for that I hope one of your kids is gay. If its genetic one of the two of you "parents" passed it on meaning its recessive in you, so go pray for your self! You NEVER disown your child over something so small and you ALWAYS support them. You don't want them committing suicide because there bigot parents won't accept them.|`|7sEFufRbaa	Not just Christians but everyone.    Matthew Shepard along with many others were killed by NONCHRISTIANS.  No one wants their child to be gay as it is a much harder road to lead.   Anyone who says differently is a liar as we all want the best for our child and we all know how many condemn homosexuals.    Some Christians may Verbally Condemn homosexuals but a true Christian would never harm as it is a sin.   So who is doing all the attacks and murders on homosexuals??   Myself I would rather be verbally told I am going to hell then be beat physically.      If my child told me they were gay-I would try to help them best I could being I have an uncle who is gay and would probably ask his advice to help my child to live a great life.   I would accept his/her lover as a child of my own.   God created everyone including homosexuals.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	Accept.|`|mdt6hz6faa	I'd take 'em out shopping and ask them to give me a makeover!|`|AA11987172	I would love them and accept them no matter what.|`|AA12346187	I would  accept  him as he is  but pray for him.|`|LLey4VRzaa	Why would a Christian treat someone who is gay any different then a Liar or thief? I treat them equally...God told me "not to Judge", God said if I Kevin Thompson have never sinned then I Kevin Thompson can say something about someone else's sin, and God said to "Love my Neighbor."|`|vSomavIzaa	one of my children actaully did come out to me as gay. We are a Christian family. We will always accept our child, it's not about "accepting" her, that's out of the question. She is my child. Of course I accept her. I will always love her and accept her, no matter what. But yes, I have also pointed out to her that God has spoken clearly on this topic. It's not a matter of reasonable Christians disagreeing over how to interpret a certain scripture. God is absolutely clear, throughout the Bible, about homosexuality. I have pointed out to her the scriptures pertaining to homosexuality, and I've clearly warned her about the eternal ramifications about what happens to people who knowingly and willingly turn their back on God's warnings and pursue their own desires. I also told her that I had committed fornication, as is also explained throughout the Bible. So I told her that I was guilty of sexual sin as well, so therefore I couldn't condemn her or judge her, "but" I have since repented for my sin, asked God to forgive me, and admit that my sin was wrong (even though it felt "natural" to me at the time) and to forsake that sin and to never commit that sin ever again. The penalty for sin is death. That's Biblical. Without repentance, there is no eternal life in heaven. So I pleaded with her to ask God to heal her heart of her desires and her lusts and if that was an area of vulnerability for her, to flee from situations where she may be at risk of acting on her lusts. And if that meant staying single, then so be it. I explained to her that I still find good looking women attractive (I'm a guy) and therefore I needed to always be vigilant to never allow myself to be in a situation where I may be able to compromise myself and act on my lustful desires. Remember, temptation is not sin. Only when you act on the temptation does it become sin. Sometimes what you think is "natural" is still a sin. The Bible says you cannot trust your heart, because your heart is "desperately wicked". The writer of Proverbs warns us, "there is a way that seems right to a man, but the ends thereof is death".      There is a price to be paid for choosing to "be happy" in a homosexual lifestyle, even if you were in a loving relationship with the same person for the next 40 or 50 years, it's still living in what God calls a sinful lifestyle.      As a Christian parent, the goal of raising Godly children is not to raise "happy" children, but to instead raise "holy" children. We are at odds with the world, as the world tells us that happiness is all that really matters. Big house, big career, big car, big 401k account, big friends, lots of gadgets, etc.      If you ever learn to break free from all that though, and turn from it and instead strive for "Holy", you will learn that there is a thing called "joy" that is much better than "happy". Lots of times, people become content with "good" when they're missing out on "best".   God tells us, "I know the plans I have for you- tnot to harm you but to prosper you". You can trust God in everything, even with your sex life.  And by the way, we also explained to our daughter that we would not knowingly condone any sinful behavior in our house. That includes homosexuality, fornication, drug use, pornography, profanity, lying, and a multitute of other sinful choices. I could go on and on, but sin is sin. "The World" has elevated certain sins over other sins, and the sexual sins is a perfect case in point. Many Christians who absolutely lose their minds when they hear about someone being gay somehow turn the other way and ignore guy/girl fornication, as though one is worse than the other. Both are called "sin" in God's eyes, and therefore they should be in ours as well.  God Bless you. I pray that you seek God's will for your life and that He would empower you to make choices that would glorify Him, and to pursue Holiness, no matter the cost.|`|S1A20Oouaa	I love my children no matter what|`|MUcINsQ3aa	Yes, homosexuality is natural, and its the business of those invloved in it only.|`|v80N4JB0aa	If it made them happy then it makes me happy    wow  whoever gave me a thumbs down must be one sick and twisted person|`|WQvqLnnhaa	I would still have to preach Gods word to them.

yMqWvG8naa	What about the 198,000 years of modern humans who lived and died before "Jesus" decided to show up?  They didn't know about Christianity because it didn't exist yet (though I suppose according to a lot of Christians they neither did the world until 6000 years ago).  Are they burning right now for not knowing about Christianity?      I suppose though, it's not completely beyond the Christian "God."  He just loves punishing people for things they didn't do, right?  I mean, we're still being punished because two people ate a piece of fruit right?  And their omnipotent "God" needed a blood sacrifice from an innocent person to "save" us all (no different from throwing a virgin into a volcano when you say it like that, eh?)?  Doesn't seem just at all so I guess damning the vast majority of all the people who have ever lived is about par for the course with the Christian bloodthirsty "God."

2d2ZuimCaa	Psalm 111:10  "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever."-The psalmist resolves to praise God himself. Our exhortations and our examples should agree together. He recommends the works of the Lord, as the proper subject, when we are praising him; and the dealings of his providence toward the world, the church, and particular persons. All the works of the Lord are spoken of as one, it is his work; so admirably do all the dispensations of his providence centre in one design. The works of God, humbly and diligently sought into, shall all be found just and holy. Gods pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works, and ought to be remembered to his glory. He will ever be mindful of his covenant; he has ever been so, and he ever will be so. His works of providence were done according to the truth of the Divine promises and prophecies, and so were verity, or truth; and by him who has a right to dispose of the earth as he pleases, and so are judgment, or righteous: and this holds good of the work of grace upon the heart of man, ver.  7,8. All Gods commandments are sure; all have been fulfilled by Christ, and remain with him for a rule of walk and conversation to us. He sent redemption unto his people, out of Egypt at first, and often afterwards; and these were typical of the great redemption, which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by the Lord Jesus. Here his everlasting righteousness shines forth in union with his boundless mercy. No man is wise who does not fear the Lord; no man acts wisely except as influenced by that fear. This fear will lead to repentance, to faith in Christ, to watchfulness and obedience. Such persons are of a good understanding, however poor, unlearned, or despised.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, this is very true.  Praise God, for he can guide us into all truth and show us the way each day of our lives.  The book of Proverbs tells us a lot about wisdom and it's a good book to read.

Maybe it would make more sense to say:    The awe of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom.    Awe is an expansive feeling.     Fear is unlikely to engender wisdom in anyone.      For wisdom to arise a peaceful and untroubled mind is usually needed, not a mind full of fear.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	He who has no fear of God has no faith in God. The greatest ascetics, those who mortified themselves and who for a period of forty or fifty years daily and nightly lived a life of mortification until death, were filled with the fear of God and these, the most sinless among mortals, cried out in their hour of death: "O God, have mercy on me a sinner!"     The fear of God is the salt of total piety. If there is not that salt then all of our piety is inspid and lax. The fear of God girds the loins, girdles the stomach and makes the heart sober, restrains the mind and flogs self-will.     Where is repentance without the fear of God? Where is humility? Where is restraint? Where is total chastity? Where is patience? Where is service and obedience?|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	Consider it only like a fear of a child from losing his mother in a crowded mall or carnival.

The Bible says:     "The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom." (Psalm 111:10)     "Let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably render God sacred service with godly fear and awe." Hebrews 12:28     "Fear God and give him glory."Revelation 14:6, 7.    This fear of God, so essential to a meaningful life, is not the same as morbid dread. We might feel dread if we are threatened by a cruel and dangerous criminal. But fear of Godor godly fearis awe and profound reverence for the Creator. It also involves healthful fear of displeasing God because he is the Supreme Judge and the Almighty, who has both the power and the authority to punish those who disobey.  However, it is not a dreadful fear, because we know this about Jehovah God:    "... With evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone." --James 1:13       Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly! --Job 34:10       Therefore, it can be said:    "The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is:   Fear the true God and keep his commandments.   For this is the whole obligation of man."

You forgot the rest of the vs.    "But fools despise wisdom and instruction. "|`|vxzyYVeYaa	If we fear God, we have reverential regard for him and are careful not to displease him. We recognize that he is the Supreme One and that we are subject to him. Those who disregard the one on whom our lives depend may be considered wise by men, but such wisdom is foolishness with God.    Fear of God is the foundation of true wisdom. Why? Recall that wisdom involves the ability to use knowledge successfully. To fear God is, not to cower before him in terror, but to bow before him in awe, respect, and trust. Such fear is wholesome and powerfully motivating. It moves us to bring our life into harmony with our knowledge of Gods will and ways. There is no wiser course that we could take, for Jehovahs standards always promote the highest good for those who follow them.    . Godly wisdom cannot exist without humility and modesty. (Proverbs 11:2) Why is that? If we are humble and modest, we are willing to admit that we do not have all the answers, that our opinions are not always right, and that we need to know Jehovahs mind on matters. Jehovah opposes the haughty ones, but he is pleased to grant wisdom to those who are humble at heart.James 4:6.|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	yes|`|UqgCazhGaa	It means without knowing Krishna in Truth we have to transmigrate in this material cycle of birth and death many millions of years and many millions of creations in various speices of life forms. Lord Krishna says Aprapya mam nivartante mrtyu samsara vartamane.   This is the fear of the Lord to rot in this material world. And that is the beginning of wisdom -  to chant HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA, KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE, HARE RAMA HARE RAMA, RAMA RAMA HARE HARE, and your life will be sublime. This opens the door way to Spiritual World - Vaikuntha where life is sat - eternity, cit - full of knowledge and ananda - bliss.     SB 10.1.69 P  The Advent of Lord Krsna: Introduction     The agitated mind is compared to agitated water reflecting the sun and the moon. Actually the sun and moon reflected on the water do not exist there; nonetheless, they are reflected according to the movements of the water. Similarly, when our minds are agitated, we wander in different material atmospheres and receive different types of bodies. This is described in Bhagavad-gita as guna-sanga. Karanam guna-sango 'sya. Madhvacarya says, guna-nubaddhah san. And Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva (Cc. Madhya 19.151). The living entity rotates up and down throughout the universe, sometimes in the upper planetary system, sometimes in the middle and lower planetary systems, sometimes as a man, sometimes a god, a dog, a tree and so on. This is all due to the agitation of the mind. The mind must therefore be steadily fixed. As it is said, sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh. One should fix one's mind at the lotus feet of Krsna, and then one will become free from agitation. This is the instruction of the Garuda Purana, and in the Naradiya purana the same process is described. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, yanti deva-vrata devan. The agitated mind goes to different planetary systems because it is attached to different kinds of demigods, but one does not go to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by worshiping the demigods, for this is not supported by any Vedic literature. Man is the architect of his own fortune. In this human life one has the facility with which to understand one's real situation, and one can decide whether to wander around the universe forever or return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (aprapya mam nivartante mrtyu-samsara-vartmani).     There is no such thing as chance. When a tree is burning in a forest fire and although the nearest tree is spared a distant tree catches fire, this may appear to be chance. Similarly, one may seem to get different types of bodies by chance, but actually one receives these bodies because of the mind. The mind flickers between accepting and rejecting, and according to the acceptance and rejection of the mind, we receive different types of bodies, although we superficially seem to obtain these bodies by chance. Even if we accept the theory of chance, the immediate cause for the change of body is the agitation of the mind.|`|6a1ce2ab43657c5b8abeb67e6a9dacf7aa	It means that once you realize who and what God is and what great power He has, this is what it means to fear God is to respect Him very highly.

I hold God and who He is in High respect.|`|mg6gAfwYaa	I strongly believe that the Lord does not wish us to fear him, Lord wishes us to fear sin and fear wrong thought, action and deed.

Try this, and you would be amazed how Lord would bestow his Love upon you.|`|3zpD3DJnaa	Means some one is brain-washed.|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings, The kind of fear that the Bible is talking about means to fear Him, for who He  is full of Majesty and Honor, it means to give Him the Respect and Glory He deserve  for He is All-Powerful ......"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Prov. 1:7). Happy the soul that has been awed by a view of God's majesty, that has had a vision of God's awful greatness, His ineffable holiness, His perfect righteousness, His irresistible power, His sovereign grace. Does someone say, "But it is only the unsaved, those outside of Christ, who need to fear God"? Then the sufficient answer is that the saved, those who are in Christ, are admonished to work out their own salvation with "fear and trembling." Time was when it was the general custom to speak of a believer as a "God-fearing man." That such an appellation has become nearly extinct only serves to show whither we have drifted. Nevertheless, it still stands written, "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him" (Psalm 103:13).    When we speak of godly fear, of course we do not mean a servile fear, such as prevails among the heathen in connection with their gods. No, we mean that spirit which Jehovah is pledged to bless, that spirit to which the prophet referred when he said, "To this man will I (the Lord) look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word" (Isa. 66:2). It was this the apostle had in view when he wrote, "Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king" (I Pet: 2:17). And nothing will foster this godly fear like a recognition of the Sovereign Majesty of God.Yes  I have Experience this fear and this wisdom of the Lord.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	No, that is not a wisdom I'd accept. I'm not theist. I have experienced the influences of greater Powers that are, but I refuse to call these; God!    I call such "wisdom" man-created fear, because man is afraid of taking up his own responsibilities. He'd rather remain an obeying child to a mythical parental figure.|`|k03dYskYaa	Without the fear of Jehovah, there can be no knowledge, for he is the Creator of all things and the Author of the Scriptures. (Romans 1:20; 2?Timothy 3:16,?17) He is the very Source of all true knowledge. Hence, knowledge begins with the reverential fear of Jehovah. Godly fear is also the start of wisdom because there can be no wisdom without knowledge. Moreover, a person who lacks the fear of Jehovah will not use whatever knowledge he has to honor the Creator.

The Mass is the sacrifice of the New Law in which Christ, through the ministry of the priest, offers Himself to God in an unbloody manner under the appearances of bread and wine.  "For, from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles; and in every place there is sacrifice and there is offered to my name a clean oblation.

I am a christo-pagan, meaning I am both Christian and a Witch. I have been able to find connections between the both to be able to make it work for me. Growing up in a conservative city, even going to church was difficult for me. My way of thinking and way of dressing has always been a little different from the majority (as it happens to many many people). The reason it is different is because I choose to walk my path while others choose to blend in. Well several times I was given talks being asked to dress a little more appropriately (using color instead of just black), to which I would tell them     "I am terribly sorry that my clothes do not please you, but if you  haven't figured it out I am here to worship and not try and blend in. I am wearing what I feel is the best, and I wear nothing but the best for my day of worship. If god truly knows what is in our heart of hearts and in our minds, then he should know what each of us feel is "the best"."    So you see, it would make more sense to offer something that we feel has value instead of something that we could care less about. THe story in the bible about when jesus was preaching and he asked for donations, several rich men were giving so much money. To them it was not so valuable because they had so much of it. He gets down off the stand and walks towards an old woman who gave her ONLY 2 cents. To her, these two cents had more value, than all that money the other men had. He acknoledged this in front of them all because she did give more.     When it comes to worship, people sometimes feel that the things we most hate doing, are the things that count the best becuase it is a sacrifice (and i can see truth in this) but even better is when you do the things that you are drawn to for this great being. For many of us it is caring for our families to raise good people. It can be something like gardening because the planet is the body of god, just as much as we are. It can also be through helping others.     No matter what you choose to do at the end of the day, or task, simply ask yourself "Do I feel closer to God?" If you answer YES then you are doing well. Spirituality is the closeness you have to the supreme being, to the whole (all in existence).     Do not be afraid to think outside the church, to work with others or even try new approaches. Be the best YOU possible and that is a type of worship as well.     Blessed Be,   Shadow Storm|`|dvyBTotxaa	"Masjid hai ghar se door, chalo kyu na kisi rote bacche ko hasaya jaaye".  why you worship the lord?  for what?

Yet man turned his back on God, despising Him. God graciously delayed judgment at the time of Adam and Eve, but by the time of the flood it is clear to all that man is intrinsically and hopelessly corrupt.  In bringing the flood, God shows the ultimate end of evil  so that ALL men for ALL time can know that there are consequences for sin.    In the flood, God destroys the world and, in effect, re-creates it.  Once the promise to Eve is fulfilled through the coming of the Redeemer, once all Gods promises are fulfilled, then destruction will come once again, by fire......After Noahs burnt offering, God states His post-flood covenant with Noah.  The covenant consists of five parts:                        Until the end of the earth, God will never again destroy all living creatures.                         God restates the creation command for man to multiply and fill the earth.                        Despite more difficult conditions after the flood, God promises that man will be able to multiply.  To this end, He gives the animals to man as food, in addition to the plants and fruits previously provided for this purpose.  In doing this, however, God forbids man to eat the blood, the purpose of which is to underscore that God is the one who gives and takes away life.                         God gives man the authority to punish wrongdoing, specifically by putting to death those who commit murder.                         God gives the rainbow as the sign of His covenant.    Gods covenant with Noah is a gracious act, by which God enables Noah and his descendants to live in the harsh post-flood environment......11 Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, 12 waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! 13 But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. 14 Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace. 15 And count the patience of our Lord as salvation. 2 Peter 3:11-15a    We have seen that man - and indeed the whole world - is stained and corrupted by sin, not only in his actions but also in his thoughts; we have seen that judgment is coming  the destruction of the entire world, as occurred at the flood; and we have seen the Promise of God, that He will provide salvation through Jesus Christ to all who believe.    Noah preached to his contemporaries, offering salvation from the coming judgment.  Just so, God offers to us salvation, eternal life in the new heavens and the new earth.  And the conditions are simple.  We need only acknowledge our own sinfulness, acknowledge Gods RIGHT to judge, acknowledge the CERTAINTY of Gods judgment, acknowledge the GRACIOUSNESS of Gods promise of salvation through Jesus Christ, and trust Him to fulfill His promises.|`|RbUbMTqOaa	yea at the rate we are going we will destroy ourselves|`|IM66g9j1aa	By a giant flood?

lJUyhMceaa	In the book of John, Jesus says that we "must be born again".      He goes on to say, "that which is flesh is flesh, and that which is spirit is spirit".    Another verse says, "flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God"    What all these verses are teaching us is that we can not go to heave as we are.  We are born into sinful flesh.  We must spiritually die to ourselves, and trust Christ as our Saviour.  When we do, God promises that He will give us His Holy Spirit.  This is when we are born of the spirit.....a New Birth.    Requires dying to ourselves (spiritually speaking), and being born again by God's Spirit.    If we are born again (saved..trusting Christ) then we will be given everlasting lift in Heaven.  If not, we will (by our own choice) receive everlasting death.    "If we are born once (physical birth), we will die twice (physical, and spiritual death)"    "If we are born twice (physical, and then spiritual), we will only die once (physical)."|`|Run7dyraaa	You have to be willing to die for Christ.

But you must be sincere in your heart when you accept Jesus, because He knows if you are or not. You cannot lie your way into heaven.
FmazIF6Maa	Depends on how you look at it.    I think religious people are already all reaching out to the same Higher Power, they just have different ideas about the nature of the Divine.    But I'm thinking no-- we're too diverse. Even if a Higher Power finally came to earth and revealed itself for all to see on the 7 o'clock news, there are bound to be rebels who go against it and conspiracy theoriests who argue it was the greatest hoax since the moon landing.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	Yes the human race can possibly come together under one form of worship.  However, you might want to be careful about what you desire because the odds are as great that this one form of worship will be the Flying Spaghetti Monster as the God of Abraham.      Thus we get to the crux of the situation, the difference between possibility and probability.  Most probably the human race will never come to agreement on following one religion.  For example the Christians would refuse to believe such could happen and would also actively reject the attempt because it would make a lie of the Book of Revelations in the Bible.  In their faith there must be non-believers for their faith in the Bible as the word of God to be right.      I'm sure you would have similar issues with the other popular monotheistic faiths because they all depend on there being non-believers to be condemned for their faith system to work.  Each modern faith requires a status of exclusivity in order to attract and retain their followers.  If everyone joins, then that status of exclusivity is lost.      So to summarize: Theoretically possible, yes.  Likely to happen, no.      I hope this helps.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Only in heaven or during the millenium because too many are wrong values and don't honor Christ.  But during the tribulation period of 7 years, the Antichrist will force worship of himself and the beast and false prophet (the unholy trinity).  I'm expecting the rapture to take place before this awful time of punishment.|`|AA11990031	Yes on that day they will.|`|q6H2ru3waa	sad to say, but no.|`|URO3gDXcaa	no.  there is no god.|`|zQyslfHKaa	Not until this absent diety decides humans are worth proving himself to.    If there was one God who loved humans, we all would be worshiping him, because he would make it abundantly clear that he was real and loved us.  It would really clear up alot of mess.  Instead we have a bunch of humans killing eachother because their imagined friend gets insulted easily.|`|KT7cllsLaa	godforbid    (i understand, the Quran teaches that)|`|WbaN6osZaa	Muslims all worship one God.  Does that mean they don't fight?    Christians all worship one God, does that mean they are all 'together'?    Apparently Christians and Jews and Muslims all worship one 'God', yet as history shows...    I think we will reach more peaceful times when people stop putting so much effort into worshiping invisible rewarding/punishing daddies in the sky, and learn to respect each other's common humanity and freedoms.|`|AA11675707	that is what the Muslims are trying now|`|c3zUqmdXaa	It will happen when Jesus come back to stablish his kingdom (Zakariah 14:9)|`|AA11894640	Seems most unlikely!    For centuries, followers of  two major religions namely,  Christianity and Islam,  have been trying their best (or worst) to catch people in their nets by persuasion/temptation or force/sword.  But their dreams have remained unfulfilled!    So,  now the only hope is that a new Messenger/Messiah of God should emerge with such powers that all differences/boundaries dissolve and human race worship as one!    P.S.  At present though,  there IS one God everyone (including Atheists & Agnostics) worships...and that's Money!!!|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	Actually,there is one God.But,every religion calls with a different name.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	It's unlikely that the human race could ever agree on how to worship God  until all the trappings of religion are dispensed with.    It is those that keep us separate.|`|23YPEAqBaa	Why do we have to worship anything, though?  I have never understood this.  I'm more for spreading unconditional love, understanding, and friendship all around the globe - now, will the human race ever do that?  Highly unlikely.  We'll need a disaster to wipe most of us out first, then we can start again, either on Earth, or lol somewhere else.  And years down that road, people will form their groups, claim their gods, and kill in the name of them.  Same old, same old.  Will we ever grow up?|`|Run7dyraaa	That would be true peace.

Last time I checked, God does not judge by the color of your skin and does not encourage segregation!|`|QCejFqXgaa	I believe it could happen  if every one believe, that God is every where and in every belief just with a different name. And beside at the lord return back to earth each knee will bow down  and worship Him  in Spirit and in true   as the Bible tell us..... Good Question, because this will happen one day.|`|3zpD3DJnaa	You should ask that what is the point of worshiping an unreal/imaginary  things?|`|KdthnkABaa	they can cumm together|`|ybFg4umCaa	I vote for Allah|`|81SiImlSaa	In a word: NO|`|AA11775172	No! not me...there is no god..|`|GcpFRStXaa	Maybe if 'One God" actually revealed them self and demonstrated a clear reason to deserve being worshiped.

Probable, no.|`|IM66g9j1aa	I would hope not. We would then have religious fundamentalism on a never before seen scale and we've seen what happens when places are ruled by 'wise men' or clergy. Disaster. Even if Obama hands America over to Islam on a silver platter, they'll still fight, Sunnis versus Shiites versus Amadiyyat. The world is going to hell in a hand basket and I thank God for global warming, pandemics and peak oil.|`|UY2MJtfGaa	No.|`|oN9GUEAEaa	I don't believe so. The beliefs of each group may have some things in common, but even christians cannot all agree. Look at how many different forms there are. Until the day when all mankind is the same, we shall just have to learn to deal with differences in religion. Not all people believe in Allah, nor do all believe in Jesus Christ. So expecting everyone to come together and agree that there is just one god, is not going to happen in this millenia. Also, remember that many of these religions are older than most. Judaism is over 4000 years old, and Buddhism goes back pretty far too. So expecting people to give up their heritage is not going to happen.    Sorry for being repetitive, just don't know how else to say it.|`|VdifDUGkaa	i'm not about to become Christian, Muslim, Jew, etc. religions with One God, i very much like my pagan way of personifying the universe's energy in the form of many different gods depending on which ones suit my needs for ritual or spell work at the time. I see "god" as an energy source rather than an entity, and that being the case and me being just one of many who feels this way, how can you ever hope to convince me or the others to worship one "god" we don't really believe in? And what about the above-mentioned religions? You may be able to get the Jew to agree that their god and the Christian god are the same--maybe. But those who believe in Allah aren't going to be likely to embrace IHVH by any stretch of the imagination. And how will you get ancestor worshippers to believe in "god" either? Then we have the atheists who will never be convinced to worship a god.    It is impossible for every human to worship One God...and in my opinion that's just the way it should be. Diversity is the spice of life.|`|nHgk09tAaa	what freedom can one (dictator) god give?|`|AA11132696	Yes!!!! I agree that will be great .

We will always have the free will to question the veracity of the "One God" dogma.  In summary: NO.|`|eibO5ax3aa	How can something as personal as spirituality be generalized to an entire population? Never going to happen....|`|6dL7UGvfaa	They can and must too. Already there are several meetings of all religious heads in different part of the world for the last few years where they have clarified many misgivings about each other and agreed that there exist some common grounds on which all can unite. I hope it will strengthen further.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Not in this world, no.  Sad, isn't it?|`|CIWd3vJIaa	I don't believe it will happen.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Hope not, because logic and reality dictate that there is NO God.|`|WalnRzfGaa	no, there are to many people that believe to many different things. it will never happen. what will most likely happen is the world will realize there is no God and come together that way.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Not until something otherworldly lands on this planet and demands we all worship it.And not a moment before.    That will never happen. All we can do is intellectually evolve past superstitious thinking and quit being afraid of the sociopathic fundamentalists.
7a15c276d2782ca7df8dc93ccf72655caa	I think people think of White Americans as being bland.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	the question is relevant. If an American goes to Africa they may be considered exotic due to being a minority.  Exotic basically means different or unusual.|`|5jTQfRGlaa	avanti ITALIA !!!!!!! number one in the world..............  german exotic?ahahahahahahah|`|LUWQ5S5jaa	I don't consider them exotic!    why does it matter to you, to be considered exotic?|`|t5hp4t79aa	Its because back in the 19th and early 20th century the term "white" meant English or Anglo Saxon, basically northern european. People from southern or eastern Europe, north Africa, and the middle east were not considered to be the same as northern Europeans. I think the notion of race in that context is changing now..If you're from another country you'll be considered exotic, regardless of the race or nationality.    Yes you can be born in America and still be considered exotic. The catch is you have to look exotic. If you look like a plain person who's ancestors came from northern or central Europe then you can't really be considered exotic..If you've got unique facial features or a little color to your skin, or both, then you're considered exotic|`|4fgcu7bAaa	Italian woman are thick and German woman are just freaks.|`|T4tXUb1Zaa	When I think of exotic, Italians and Germans don't come to mind. There are plenty of full-blooded Germans and Italians in the U.S. - I don't think they're exotic or have what most people consider to be an exotic look. When I think of exotic, I think more dark hair, tan skin, brown eyes, like the Spanish or Greek. Dark and mysterious - mysterious because there aren't a whole lot of people from these ethnicities in the States, at least not where I am. Latinas and Asians are sometimes considered exotic in the States, though not in areas that are heavily Latin and Asian - then they become more ordinary.     Exotic is so relative. I'm sure people outside the U.S. think white Americans, or any Americans for that matter, are exotic.|`|AA10067344	If you are American, you have to go somewhere else to be exotic.    Also, white Americans are not necessarily British.|`|khdFNlJ7aa	Germans are considered Exotic? I didn't know that.|`|fkQUCwUhaa	well i would consider italians exotic but not germans. germans just look like plain old white anglo saxons.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	now seriously, who considers germans exotic?|`|rGWiOVDIaa	For some reason people group everyone with light skin as white as if that was a race. It's kind of messed up, but not really worth making a revolution about.    I think being exotic is relative. In Jr. High people counted me as exotic because I was 1 of 5 blonde hair/blue eyed out of 500 students. After moving to a dominantly white neighborhood they considered the 2 mixed kids exotic.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	I never heard about Germans being exotic. that would be a lie|`|YoHroOcGaa	Most white Americans are from German ancestry and in NYC it's mostly Italian ancestry|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Your definition of Exotic? Only because when I think of exotic Germans are the furthest association in my mind to it. Nothing against Germans just not making the connection.|`|yS9a9jk5aa	None of them are exotic. I am.|`|oOR511mFaa	I never knew people thought Germans were exotic. Italians yes, but Germans?|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Not just German, but I don't even consider Italians "exotic".|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Germans - exotic? Hahaha! :-D Germans are the "bread & butter" of Europe. Germanic tribes were the ancestors of most modern European nations, including the English.    Italians are a Mediterranean nation, hot blooded, very emotional and expressive. They are the direct descendants of the ancient Romans too!    The white Americans are the descendants of the European immigrants, mostly the Irish (hence the similarities in their accents). I don't consider them exotic at all.

8UP6iQ5Zaa	It is because his ties to Islam fit very well into an "end times" scenario.

They're stupid.|`|i48kxrbaaa	Its crazy to me too.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	It seems crazy because it IS crazy.    Serious christianity is losing both political and social clout in the United States. The hypocrisy here is far worse than anything in the UK. They wear their religion on their sleeve, make hideously inflammatory remarks, and blame evry last little thing on atherists, freethinkers, Realists, etc, and more and more Americans are becoming wise to it.    Even our most famous preacher today Rick Warren, who has compared gays to pedaphiles and the wombs of aborted babies to concentration camps. And oh yes, Warren is an obese porn addict.    Holy? No. Crazy? Yup!    Thats the best you're going to get from American religion. That and threats that Obama will somehow end the world. He's already gone on Saudi Television reaching out to moderate Muslims to join him in his quest to bring down Al Qaida. Bush could never be so effective!    A wave of bitterness from these reactionaries have regulated them to the back of the bus, now all they can do is make hollow threats that the "end is near" or that Obama will ruin this country.Please.    The (christian)Republican Party has lost credibility with moderates, now all they have is their otherwise unemployable spokesman Rush Limbaugh saying of Obama "I hope he fails".    Just betweenn you and me, too many Americans are brainwashed and just plain nuts. You see all the lab-created christian propaganda from Americans on this site.

Furthermore,, the anti-christ will come from the revived Roman Empire of which apparently Obama's ancestry can be traced back to.  Furthermore, his campaign for presidency was backed by Oprah Winfrey and the strange cult thing she has got going on in the usa.    It all seemed a little crazy to me, whilst I do not think he is the anti-christ I certainly feel we are in the end times.  I will add a link - not my forte so hope it works haha - which should give you some more information.    Many people are speculating that 2012 is the year of Christ's return.    Are you a believer?

S8pIwxpwaa	Has your old boss agreed to write the recommendation? Or do you just have a request in to him, with no acknowledgement?    If he has already agreed, it is well within bounds to follow up with him. Be clear and don't beat around the bush-- but also remember that he's the one doing you a favor. Say something like "Hey boss, I was wondering if I could get that recommendation from you by next week? My grad school app is due soon. I really appreciate it."    Best of luck on grad school!

So no, I think it's perfectly ok to cry at a movie - especially one that provokes so many emotions and when you can relate to it to a certain extent.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	of course it's okay.  did you ever see Joy Luck Club?  that one will make you cry|`|AA12158476	Anybody who doesn't cry over "Prayers For Bobby" has no emotions what so ever. You can't help but not cry at this one. Good Movie.

For example, in the newspaper the other day, there was an article about a recovering heroin addicts whose children had been in foster care for 2 years because their grandparents were 'too old'. So now it has been decided that they will be adopted by a gay couple.  But the article said it 'The final blow was dealt to the poor grandparents when they were told a gay couple would adopt their grandchildren' as if the fact that they were gay was bad. They tehn tried to use some cruddy reason that they would not grow up properly without a mother figure. The newspaper also said 'They are going to a homosexual couple despite several heterosexual couples wanting to adopt them' as if their sexuality should give them priority! Did they ever stop to think they are going to the gay couple because they are better suited?    I'm not saying i agree, their grandparents were 56 and 49 i think, i think they should have got them, but the prejudice again gay people was clear in that article.     So yes, i like to prove myself where appropriate that my sexuality does not make me less of a person.|`|0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	The only person I have to prove anything to is myself.

St. Peter at eh time of His deinals had not yet witnesssed the lords ressurection nor had he recived the sacrsmnet of confirmation which fits one to be a solider for our lord,ie, his trainign was not complete.    After he and the others that formed the first catholic church were sealed with the holy sprirt at penticost he was indeed faced with this situation as it becae offical roman policy to persecute christians.  Judge himn during this time.  Now he did not boldy go out into the sttrreets of rome with the bible in his had and a stack of tracts as wee see so many fundies doing today, there's a name for that it is not courage it is suicided at the mouth of a lion.  But he held mass secretly undergrond both literally and figuratively, as he actuall held mass in the catecombs underneth the city of rome.  so, he "stood his ground" only after he had been confirmed.  To judge him prior is to judge an incomletly traind bishop.    John 13:36 Simon Peter asked, Lord, where are you going?  And Jesus replied, You cant go with me now, but you will follow me later. 37 But why cant I come now, Lord? he asked. Im ready to die for you. 38 Jesus answered, Die for me? I tell you the truth, Peterbefore the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me    The above scrippture not only predicts St. Peter's denail prior to his confirmation being sealed with the holy sprit at penticost, but it also  predicts St. Petrs maryrdom and the amnner of this death.  St. Peter was eventully caught runningthe churhc in rome celebrating mass etc., and converting others ordinng new bishosp to take his palce, genraly doing what he was charged to do by our lord when He gave St. Peter the keys to the kingdom of god/heave on earth, and for this he was crucifed, requesting to have it done upside down as he did not feel worthy to die as our lord did, so he did indeed "follow" our lord.  Your disrespec of our first pope by insluting his courage and using an examplary follow as a bad example indicates both your lack of memebshi in the kingdom of god and your complete misunderstandin of scripture, it is infact a bore,and as you have seen EASILY despensed with by any confirmed catholic.  bRING ME YOUR PASTROR SO I CAN DO SOME REAL GOOD BY STRAIGHTENING OUT THAT WOLF IN SHEEPS CLOTHING.    But by l means continue your personal attack against the church that jesus personally founded.
mfSp38yzaa	That it's the Body and Blood of Christ. Jesus said it was, He said that if you don't eat is Flesh and drink His Blood, you have no life within you. Both the Body and the Blood contain the full presence of Christ-neither is more important than the other.    EDIT: Oh, you want songs? Well, I would suggest anything sung during Adoration. In particular,  "O Salutaris" and "Tantum Ergo"|`|8rGZFBKOaa	Why do you object to "Communion" instead of "Eucharist"?    If I absolutely HAD to choose, I'd say the cup.....  For Jesus took the cup and He said, "This is my Blood which was shed for the Remission and Forgiveness of sins and for the New Covenant between us....." (Paraphrased slightly)    Without this, we would not be Forgiven........ at least that's what this part of the Eucharist states. Without Forgiveness, we cannot enter the Kingdom. So, that's why I think it's the most important.|`|5qjxyb0jaa	It is pagan    In ancient Babylon, a queen named Semiramis, married her son, NImrod, then declared herself to be a goddess.  She went under such names as Diana, Venus, and the Queen of Heaven.  When NImron died, she declared that he had become the sun-god, Baal.   She gave birth to Tammuz, declaring that he was the reincarnation of Nimrod.  She delared that she had bore Tammuz without the help of a man, and thus started the mother/child worhips, and many idols of Semaris and the inant Tammuz were set up.   Semaris bacame the mother of Baal, or simply, the "mother of god."      Centuries later in Ejypt, the Ejyptian priests developed a ritual known as 'transusbstination" to pull their sun-god out of the sky and put him in a wafer.   The Wjyptians would then eat their god for "spiritual nurishment."        Today, Roman Catholics pray to Mary as being the "Queen of Heaven," howbeit they know not that they are actially praying to Semaris, the pagan Babyolinin goddess.  And for Jesus, Rom has perverted Him brom being the Son of God into being a sun-god, Tammuz.\      Catholics not only believe that their priest has the power to turn the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, but they believe that the substance of bread and wine are fully gone and fully transformed into Christ's flesh and blood, despite the fact that it still looks/feels/tastes like bread and wine!!!      Roman Catholic doctrine teaches that Eucharistic "adoration," "processions" are not idolatry because 'Jesus' is fully contained in the wafer, and that worshipping the wafer is in effect, worshipping 'Jesus.'   Dear papist friends, know ye not that the Egyptians also used ''transubstantiation" to put their sun-god into a wafer to be eaten just like your priests do?   When you bow down to that Eucharist cracker, you are not bowing to the Creator of the universe, but to a sun-god.   Why do you think that your monstrance (device that the wafer is placed when it is being adored) is shaped like a SUNBURST?  That is because your wafer-god is a sun-god!!!   It is not Jesus that you worship in the Eucharist, it is Tammuz, it is Osirus, IT IS BAAL!!!      These pagan rituals originated in ancient Babylon|`|Xm4NvBPLaa	Leave it !

I think it's pretty cool actually. Battlecruisers made of solid gold and ivory, glowing and reflecting on the ocea waves, the salty wind blowing through Jesus' new high and tight.
LUWQ5S5jaa	I agree 100%!  Because my exterior is not who I am, I did not choose the body i am living in.  I also don't think it is fair.  Why should I be poraised for something I have no control over, and others looked down on for the same reason.    I am glad you have realized we are so much more than exterior beauty.  a lot of people become so reliant on that,  that of the mere thought of aging gets them down.  These bodies are only temporary.  We are the spirit that lies within, and it is such a blessing to know this!|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I don't feel guilty but sometimes I feel uncomfortable depending on the circumstances and who is giving the compliment. I would rather be praised for other qualities, like my personality or talents rather than my looks.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	I agree. Looks fade but yet so many people base so much on them. That's why I completely on personality.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I mean this in the nicest possible way, but you need, in the worst way, to get down on your knees and thank God for the gift He has given you, because you come across as incredibly ungrateful.      Is it not the same for any gift?  I'm intelligent - I have a bachelor's and a master's degree, and I work as a computer programmer.  If someone tells me I'm smart, I don't feel guilty about it, I feel grateful.  An accident causing brain damage could take it all away, as could Alzheimer's when I get older.  But it makes absolutely no sense to say, "It's nice now, but I truly have no control over it."      Feeling guilty about your gifts is a sure sign of ingratitude.  Appreciate fully the gifts you have while you have them!
5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Well, I'm 61 now, and for the first 50 years I heard all sorts of praise about my appearance, I never thought it was important, although for part of my life I made my living off my looks as a model.  Then in retail telling others how to dress.  Of course you are correct, even the compliments change as you get older, and since I never went to excess to improve my appearance, no surgery or 'mini' face lifts or exotic expensive creams or treatments, I always just felt it was more good luck than hard work.  But I never felt guilty, just that it was there, like a fact of life, I couldn't take credit for it, and I'd say thank you and get on with whatever.  I do miss it a bit now though, nothing is as invisible in our society as a woman over sixty, and when they add 'for your age' to their compliment it has a bit of a sting, but I still just say thank you.  Over a lifetime I can say I met with more than enough jealousy to make up for any guilt about my appearance that I might have felt.|`|OHydEvTCaa	I feel happy but i don't let compliments "Go to the Head". If you know that you're beautiful then it really shouldn't surprise you much.

My looks are largely dependent on my DNA, and there is no inherent worth in my appearance. It was the luck of the draw. It would be more meaningful if people recognized my compassion, tolerance, or intelligence.|`|ern87uWhaa	Nope, but I do not go fishing for complements so people will and I usually turn the attention on something good/beautiful about them when 'praised' on my looks.|`|rThIVk2maa	No need to feel guilty, a modest "thank you", accompanied by your blush and a change of subject is generally a good way to handle it.
FBrwlhPtaa	At the creation of man, God commanded that humans in Genesis 1:28 take control over the earth and rule over the animals.11 Having dominion doesn't mean to pillage and plunder, but to take care of the earth and its creatures and resources. Immediately after creating Adam, God put him into the garden of Eden that He had planted and put him to work in "taking care" of the garden. The Hebrew verb translated "to take care" (shamar - Strong's number H8104) is also translated "preserve", "keep", "watch", "maintain", "defend", and "attend." The nature of man's dominion of the earth is clarified in Psalm 8, which says that man is to have dominion over all of God's works on the earth, including the birds, domesticated herds, and the wild beasts of the field, and the fish and other life of the sea. Protecting God's creation is not just the responsibility of secular organizations, but should be the responsibility of evangelical Christians, as well. According to the National Association of Evangelicals:    Just as we show our love for the Savior by reaching out to the lost, we believe that we show our love for the Creator by caring for his creation. Because clean air, pure water, and adequate resources are crucial to public health and civic order, government has an obligation to protect its citizens from the effects of environmental degradation.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	The bible says to be earth's stewards.

The earth is God's creation and He said it was good.  We are to be good stewards/caretakers of the earth.|`|JCnSm91uaa	NO SUCH CONCERN AMONG THE CHRISTIANS...!!!    Christians have all the Bible support to be as cruel to animals as they wish. They are restricted ONLY by the secular laws that protect our animals! After many years of Bible schooling the preachers are trained to disregard stories like this one for being too gross and uncivilized in our contemporary culture, but way back then in primitive Bible times it was acceptable to have a God that couldnt care less about the animal kingdom. Except for some cosmetic attributes like God is love, God is Merciful and so on the rest of the Bible depicts God as the bloodiest most sadistic Deity of all time. Also, the Bible writers created Samson to be the strongest cartoon character in the Bible! As far as being cruel to animals he was second only to the Bible God! Sunday School teachers STILL love to show children some sadistically oriented drawings of Samson tying the tail of foxes together in pairs with a lit torch in between and setting them loose ON FIRE. Can you imagine a most cruel torture having 300 foxes with their fluffy tails on fire as they run in desperation for their life?     Judges 15:4-8 (NIV) So he went out and caught THREE HUNDRED FOXES* (*Samson caught all of them alive!) and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails, lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines* (*old Palestinians). He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves.  When the Philistines asked, Who did this? they were told, Samson, the Timnites son-in-law, because his wife was given to his friend. So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death. Samson said to them, Since youve acted like this, I wont stop until I get my revenge on you.* (*A Holy Vendetta!!!) He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them* (Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus!)    Nothing beats the Bible as a book on all kinds of cruel numbers that you can play on some beautiful animals, including human beings! Christians refuse to discuss them! The most notorious human burn sacrifice that God enjoyed was that of the young virgin daughter of Jephthah!    Judges 11:39-40 (NIV) After the two months, she returned to her father and he did to her as he had vowed* (*she was sacrificed alive by fire on the altar to the LORD God or was it Jesus of the Holy Trinity in Heaven who enjoyed the sweet aroma of the burn offering?). And she was a virgin. From this comes the Israelite custom that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.    Christians are also encouraged by the Great Faith of Noah to be TOTALLY unconcerned about animal species near extinction!  They claim that God is on record replenishing the Earth with animals and people after the flood!      Genesis 8:20-21 (NIV) Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and, taking SOME OF ALL the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.  The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: "Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done* (*Christians firmly believe that God will no longer destroy humankind, but God will send all Non-Christians and Christians of the wrong brand to be tormented with fire and sulfur in Hell for ever and ever for all eternity!).    Noah and Jephthath also made it into the FAITHFUL HALL OF FAME in The New Testament along with Samson the most cruel animal abuser in the Bible (Heb 11:7,32)!     In a nutshell that is the Bible teaching on Gods love for humans and animals The Bible writers are telling us that this same indescribably sadistic God in the Bible sent himself in the masochistic personality of God the Son Jesus Christ to be beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and marinated in Roman soldiers spit to be grotesquely nailed to a Holy Cross as a dignified spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world! How religiously primitive can you still get in our society? Now Christians delightfully snack on this Jesus Christs spit flavored meat and drink of his Holy Blood for salvation (John 6:53)! There is hardly a story in the Bible that is not full of all sorts of explicit bloody murder and cruelty If you dont become a Christian like the Bible writers suggest you will go to be tormented with fire and sulfur in Hell for ever and ever! So good luck America!|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	I know of a Scripture, but not the exact refferance. the Bible says that we are to take care of what God gives us. that we are HIS stewards. I think that includes the earth. that doesn't mean worshiping the earth, just taking care of it. being good stewards. I think Christians should praise God for the beauty of nature, not worship nature itself. we should probobly recycle, use paper instead of plastic, and re-use things as much as possible before throwing it away. for instance, using a plastic bag to pick up the dog's doo. if you have a dog. don't obsess over taking care of the earth, jsut do your part.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	Our responsibility is to be aware of what God has provided and be a good steward of ALL He has given us.    For biblical reference, take a look at the story of the unjust steward in Luke 16. Also:    Psa 104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.    Psa 115:16 The heaven, [even] the heavens, [are] the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.|`|gebIjqnWaa	We don't worship the creation, we worship the creator. It is said that we have the right to do as we choose but that freedom comes with  consequences, for in the end you will reap what you sow.

7zbj4jU1aa	There a few ways to bless someone. You can bless someone with a material object, or money from your heart. Many times God will move you to do so, and you will not have a clue why, but he knows the needs of people. There will be times you will think can't do it this time Lord, but you will, and it will come back to you 10, or so fold. Other times it will not, but this is to see how great is your faithfulness, for getting something back is not a reason to bless someone. Let me explain a little of the curse first, (very little to be honest). Word's travel, and connot be stopped once sent. In a curse if you tell someone, "your stupid, you will never amount to anything, You can't handle that job, that person will never be saved, ect. ect. That is a curse. Saing things like I hope you die, your gonna lose your job. All a curse. You are speaking death, of body, mind soul, spirit, work, school. Anything negative. I would rather someone cuss me out then speak negitive into my life. Thus the blessing. In the times of the book of Genisis, and I believe even now jews bless there children at birth, or when a father is ready to pass on all he has, he will speak life to that son. May you crops grow alway, may your sons be strong, and so on. I am not as well studied in the area as i should be, but that is some of it. You can find more in your bible, look up blessings, and curses, and if you have a study Bible you' find alot. there is a passage in the old testoment where they stood on mountains, and shouted them both for allthe people to hear. If you can't find it let me know, and I will look it up.     May God bless you thinking, and open up his word to you My sister in the Lord.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	It means you wish them good luck.|`|UujliMsCaa	Blessing is imparting something and in order to do so, you have to have something to impart.

He was able to do that because God had made a covenant with him that he would be blessed. It was the same blessing that Abraham passed on to him.    To bless someTHING is honestly senseless. Things are inanimate. You can't empower a rock with blessings.

LLey4VRzaa	Flavius Josephus, who lived until 98 A.D., was a romanized Jewish historian. He wrote books on Jewish history for the Roman people. In his book, Jewish Antiquities, he made references to Jesus. In one reference he wrote:    About this time arose Jesus, a wise man, who did good deeds and whose virtues were recognized. And many Jews and people of other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. However, those who became his disciples preached his doctrine. They related that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive. Perhaps he was the Messiah in connection with whom the prophets foretold wonders. [Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, XVIII 3.2]    Pliny the Younger, proconsul in Asia Minor, in 111 A.D. wrote to Emperor Trajan in a letter:    ...it was their habit on a fixed day to assemble before daylight and recite by turns a form of words to Christ as a god; and that they bound themselves with an oath, not for any crime, but not to commit theft or robbery, or adultery, not to break their word, and not to deny a deposit when demanded. After this was done, their custom was to depart, and meet again to take food...    Roman historian, Tacitus, who is respected by modern scholars for historical accuracy, wrote in 115 A.D. about Christ and His Church:    The author of the denomination was Christ[us] who had been executed in Tiberius time by the Procurator Pontius Pilate. The pestilent superstition, checked for a while, burst out again, not only throughout Judea...but throughout the city of Rome also...     Other secular witnesses to the historical Jesus include Suetonius in his biography of Claudius, Phlegan recording the eclipse of the sun during Jesus' death and even Celsus, a pagan philosopher. It must be kept in mind that most of these sources were not only secular but anti-Christian. These secular authors, including the Jewish writers, had no desire or intention to promote Christianity. They had no motivation to distort their reports in favor of Christianity. Pliny actually punished Christians for their faith. If Jesus were a myth or His execution a hoax, Tacitus would have reported it as such. He certainly would not have connected Jesus' execution to Roman leaders. These writers presented Jesus as a real historical person. Denying the reliability of these sources in connection to Jesus would cast serious suspicion on the rest of ancient history.    Now these ancient secular writings do not prove that Jesus is the Son of God or even the Christ, but that is not the goal of this tract. These reports show that a virtuous person named Jesus did live in the early first century A.D. and authored a religious movement (which still exists today). This Person was at least called Christ - the Messiah. Christians in the first century also appeared to consider Him God. Finally these writings support other facts found in the Bible surrounding His life. The claim that Jesus never existed and His life is a myth compromises the reliability of ancient history.|`|AA11946554	Jesus never authored a book. His actual existence is questionable b/c what was written ABOUT him was several decades after he was supposed to have lived.  Re Fireballs response...'EVIDENCE IS ALL AROUND US.....MOUNTAINS, ANIMALS,,,SKIES, MOON ETC AND HUMANS..' Those can all be attributed to other deities w/ the same amt of passionate belief OR a person can simply accept the scientific reasons w/o there needing to be a concrete 'why' answer.  The deity of the Old Testament, YHWH, is nothing like Jesus. It is an all together different character and an after-life is not even described.  Isaiah 45:7 'I make good and create evil. I, the Lord, do all these things'...that contradicts the New Testament idea that there is an opposing evil deity, called Satan. There is a mention of the word 'satan' in Job, but it is an old Aramaic word that means questioner or adversary. It is the title given to that particular angel-servant of YHWH who does nothing w/o God's permission.  Edit: Re, Kevin- You might want to look into the authenticity of Josephus. Also, 'Christ' was a title. That word being mentioned is 'proof' of Jesus as much as the word 'king' would be 'proof' of King Arthur.|`|cl4wdRnvaa	There is no proof that Jesus ever existed.

However, his existence as a historical person is in no way evidence of him being God. Jesus wrote nothing and I'm more than willing to believe that people like the disciples, Constantine and others altered history, his life and his words so that they could force their own way. Actually there is a Gospel of Jesus but you Christians do not accept it as valid. Jesus was not a liar because he didn't actually say anything.

I am happy to accept that a man called Jesus did walk upon the Earth, I mean there's a lot of people now that share the name, what I will not accept is that an ancient, constantly re-written book of fables and stories is undeniable proof of the existence of a god. And it's a big jump to go from my statement to calling your god a liar, that kind of twisted logic is the kind of fundamentalist nonsense that gives your religion a bad name (well, part of it).|`|332dd8467b31eeba85e0c5b0ec33f75aaa	There is proof that Cesar existed, coins with his face on them, busts of him from the time, and historical records, same goes for Napoleon, we even have his clothes as evidence of his existence, his houses still stand, Cleopatra has a tomb, historical records from the time etc, however there is no actual record except the bible that states jesus was ever alive, and if you were going to try and prove existence in a court of law then hearsay in a book written years after the event and changed hundreds of times by different authorities would not stand up.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	Every village must have its headman; every needle must have its manufacturer and craftsman.

If there were genuine objective or verifiable evidence, then we would have no choice but accept it.     >>Its perfectly simple,Jesus walked,now either Jesus was a liar or He wasnt.  >>When an atheist says there is no evidence they are in affect calling Our Lord a liar.    That is a logical fallacy called "assuming your conclusion".  That mean that your argument is only valid if your assertion is correct.    >>Show me proof caeser existed and i'll believe he existed,same goes for napoleon,and cleopatra    There is a wealth of verifiable documentary evidence, for the existence of all of those people.    There are statues, of some.  Others have their likeness on coins.  Napolion's portrait is well know.    Then there are the thousands of confirming documents, some written by their friends, but more importantly, some written by their enemies.  But even more importantly, some written by casual observers, with no affiliations.    There is no such evidence for your Jesus.    Everything that is written about Jesus, was written by his followers, none of which were likely to have been alive when he was supposed to have walked, as the earliest known text was not written until some fifty years after he supposedly died.    There are no texts written by his enemies, which is strange, but even more strange, is that of all of the thousands of wittnesses that the NT tells of, none of them wrote it down.    By the way, Ceasar, is a title, not a name.    >>can i hear a logical argument from atheists thats doesnt use the word faith or subjective please?

Your question (rant?) is just illogical.|`|AA11207604	jesus could have been a liar,i make out that the whole story of jesus  could have been made up just like harry potter  some person or persons could have said lets make up a story  about this fella called jesus and see how big it gets  you want proof that ceasar or napoleon existed  there are plenty of records to prove they existed  so if jesus did exist how do you know he was who the bible says he was. the bible is just a book|`|JXQKhykOaa	there our no credible records of jesus written by anyone without an agenda to support his exsistance.|`|pr3ISlJVaa	The NT is not Jesus work.|`|ZRtnCFU3aa	There are so many logical fallacies in your question I am not sure where to begin:    1. First of all Caesar is a last name, I assume you mean Jullus Caesar (not Octavia, Augustus, etc.).  There is actually substantial evidence he existed. The one you guys usually use is Socrates, and frankly there ARE historians who think that Socrates may have just been an invention of Plato and not a real person.  In either case, it is certainly possible that some historical figures are pure myth.  The further back in time we go, the more sketchy the records, the more possible this becomes.  Now Napolean was a very bad example as there is OVERWHELMING proof he actually existed.    2. Now the 'jesus was either a liar or he wasn't' is so overly simplisitc as to boggle the imagination.  What if he was not a liar but his followers exagerated some of the claims about him and what he said? What if some of what he said was true, but on onther things he was simply mistaken (not a liar)?  What if he was simply a creation of Matthew, Mark, Peter, and John (BTW those are the only biblical authors that even claim to have actually met Jesus. Paul and Luke did not).      So there is a VERY logical argument refuting your entire question. I doubt it will have much effect on you though. I would probably have an easier time trying to teach my cat calculus than getting a fundamentalist to understand logic and reason.|`|0sgggfRyaa	GOD=UNIVERSE  infinity is in u and out of u|`|7413AjIPaa	I think your right.

You make this claim that "jesus walked" -- yet the only "evidence" you have of that are copies of copies of copies of some writings (we don't have "original" texts of any of the gospels) made by people who never saw jesus, never heard a word he supposedly spoke, and wrote everything down long after he was gone.  Contemporary historical accounts from other sources at the time (Roman, Greek, Egyptian, etc.) make no mention of any kind of jesus (don't bring out Josephus, it's a well-established later fraud).      Let's compare that with Cleopatra (you didn't specifiy *which* ceasar to compare it to, and the Napoleon thing is patently ridiculous so I'll ignore it).  We have literally hundreds of documents -- originals -- from Egypt giving eyewitness accounts of her reign, laws she issued, histories of her life, etc.  We have eyewitness accounts (originals!) from Roman sources that document her existence, and agree with very little discrepancy about the timeline and major events surrounding her.  There are other contemporary references to her from no less than 6 independent cultures, not all of which were under Roman rule.  We have depictions of her made during her life in the form of statues and drawings.  Independent evidence from multiple sources that all agrees.  That's evidence.    Now, if there were only a few references to Cleopatra from one location and a small time period by writers who were not eyewitnesses to her life, I would agree with you -- that there was no credible evidence that she ever existed.  That's what we have with jesus.  We have considerably more, however, with Cleopatra.    The Napoleon example is ridiculous because we have literally thousands of eyewitness accounts from independent sources, extensive writings in his own hand, hundreds of portraits and depictions of him -- nothing like the situation with jesus.    Peace.  edit, note to kevin:  how can you call the two accounts from past 100 AD "eyewitness?"  The only wrote what the christians believed, they didn't say it was a fact.  They weren't around to see it.|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	I believe Jesus existed and walked ... I just don't believe he is god or the son of god.

The gospels claimed that he walked on water.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	Oh great another prepubescent semi-literate who just came across the Liar Lord or Lunatic argument and thinks it's the bee's knees.    1) There is no contemporary document of his existence at all.  None of the gospels were written until decades later and none by eye-witnesses.    2) We have meticulous Roman histories from the period.  They absolutely 100% fail to mention the slaughter of the newborns, the dead rising from their graves and so on.  We have price lists from tanners' shops in 1st century CE Judaea, but nobody mentioned the dead being risen up?  If you manage to google Josephus please be aware no serious scholar - even the religious ones - dispute it is a third century forgery.    3) Stories of messiahs were ten a penny at the time.  Many of them were even called Jesus.  You didn't think fiction was only invented in the 16th century did you?    Even if you ignore all the above (you doubtless will) that silly trilemma misses one obvious other option.  That the people who wrote about this Jesus person, if he existed at all, were either intentionally making it up or honestly mistaken.      LOTS OF PROOF YOU SAY?   Great - cite it and not only will I convert to a denomination of your choice with full tithing, but I will do everything I can to make you justly famous, because nobody else has managed to find proof yet.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	No evidence supporting the existence of Jesus that was recorded during the time of his lifespan. All historical mentionings of Jesus were written decades or more after his supposed death.    Even if Jesus did exist, there is no real evidence to prove he was who he said he was.     Even if Jesus was the son of God, we have no proof that he rose from the dead.    Even if Jesus rose from the dead, we have no real way of knowing that we receive salvation from him.    Who has died, gone to heaven or hell, and came back to tell the tale? Some have claimed to do so, but how do we know we can trust them?    We cannot trust this stuff as truth just because some people want to believe it. If God is real and wants us to believe in him, he can prove himself to each one of us on our own terms. Not so we can get some sick amusement by making him jump through hoops, but rather showing us individually that he actually does want a personal relationship with us by presenting himself to us in a believable fashion.    If we are supposed to be convinced of his existence by the fallacious arguments presented by the multitude of hypocrites who claim to represent him, then he has failed miserably.

YrjxCFXAaa	I am good friends with quite a few Hijabis and they dress soooo stylish! one thing that many people misconstrue about the middle east is that they are poor countries, which they obviously are not (dubai anyone)! they get their clothes from europe and still manage to dress modest and chic.      1) buy lots and lots of tunics... there are many pretty ones that you can wear nice skinny jeans with. plus, you can buy cute dresses too, just wear a longsleave undershirt with leggings or jeans.  2) forever21 is your new best friend (go online and find a lot of colorful longsleaves to wear under shortsleave shirts/dresses  3) when you are ready to wear a hijab, buy cute, colorful patterns and not just black or gray or white all the time.  4) long skirts, lots of new shoes!!! rings, bracelets!!! purses!!!    This is the perfect reason for you to get a whole new wardrobe/ go on a shopping spree!    Here are some sites/pictures that may help:    http://preciousmodesty.blogspot.com/2007...    http://preciousmodesty.blogspot.com/2008...    http://hijabstyle.blogspot.com/2008_02_0...|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Hmmm..

You should be wearing the hijab for yourself, not your family. Remember, Allah (swt) always judges your intentions.     If you want to begin dressing modestly, don't reveal cleavage. The only skin that may be seen is your face, neck, hands and feet. Don't wear your pants or shirt too tight (ie. there are no folds on your clothing because it's too tight) but if you like they can still fit well. I think that way of dressing is modest.     If you really want to dress modestly, you can begin to wear long skirts over your pants or tights. I think that is unnecessary but if that what *you* feel comfortable in (not your family) then you should go for it.    Good luck, sister.
cl4wdRnvaa	Deist/Pantheist. I have my own Personal belief.    This is how I would describe my personal beliefs:    I'm a Deist/Pantheist. I believe the consciousness of the entire universe is God. I believe God created the Big Bang by knowing it's on consciousness. [ "I think, therefore I am" -Descartes]. I believe all living things have a soul and collectively make up the mind of God. I believe in Karma and Reincarnation. I think of God as the underlying laws and rules of the universe. I see God at the quantum level of all laws. God to me is a Physicist, Geneticist and Mathematician. An ancient book doesn't tell me what to believe. As Science uncovers the laws of the Universe, we uncover God. I also go to science first, since I majored in Anthropology and have a B.A. in it.    My principals:  1. I can't interfere with the free will of others.  2. I can't withhold knowledge from anyone.  3. I can't let the first 2 rule conflict as least as possible.|`|AA12360579	No religion.

Both Christmas and Easter were pagan celebrations long before the birth of your Christ.    Should you NOT believe in the 'Golden Rule' because it appears in every religion BEFORE Christianity?????    Better give this one another thought...and let your 'girlfriend' celebrate anything she wants to.    cheiko:  The reason the anonymous writers of the bible stated.."do not be yoked with unbelievers' was becaue they did not want their MYTHS, the Deceptions and their LIES to be exposed by people with more intelligence that semi-literate desert nomads.

It's called Christmas because the "church" changed the name of it and made it more convenient to try and convert Pagans into Christianity.

Conversely, the phrase "Oh s**t!" are still the most common last two words found on black boxes at airplane crashes.     Everything has it's proper context, I suppose...    As for Christmas and Easter... since they began as pagan holidays, perhaps it's YOU that shouldn't be celebrating them...    Christmas was combined with the birthday celebration of Mithra (Dec. 25th) by the Romans. Easter was combined with a fertility ritual.     -SD-

There's no reason to import a modern, secular, individualistic model into the church ... other Christians who know you well should be helping you discover your gifts. It's also true that many gifts have to be worked on, developed, and that takes discipline and support from other Christians. Perhaps what you need is a mentor, an older Christian who will meet with you now and again and talk things over, and give you some guidance. Someone who sees you in a church setting, and maybe even in a home or work setting also. Someone you trust and can regard as a friend, not just a mentor. But don't beat yourself up over this, if nobody identified a gift in you yet, for me that points to a failure in the fellowship that knows you more than it points to a failure in you.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	You write fairly well, you express yourself better than some who write on here, that could be a 'gift'.

That can be as simple as encouraging someone else to saving their life. I had a friend that was suicidal. She went to the store to buy the ingredients to make her one last meal, as corny as it sounds. She knows now those in the depths of depression don't think rationally.    Anyway as she was going through the check out counter she heard the cashier say, "You know God really loves you". The cashier denied saying it but was blushing. What that cashier didn't know was that simple sentence made my friend decide maybe she was loved. So instead of fixing a last meal she went to a church looking for help.    Teri Schivo was like a vegetable. No one knew her until her parents fought her husband over allowing her to starve to death. Because of that controversy many people saw the need to write a living will realising the same could happen to them. So despite the fact she was totally unaware of what was going on she made a difference.    Way too many people see talents & gifts are something that's obvious. My granny never worked outside the home, never had any money to give me, her voice crackled when she sang, the gifts she was missing were the most obvious. Yet very few if any have impacted my life as much as she did. Her gift was being able to love others freely and forgive easily even the pain others caused her. I'd hate to see where my life would be if she had never been in it.     Don't ever say it doesn't matter whether you live or die. To someone (either in the past, present or future) it matters. Those with the lesser gifts will get more attention in the end. Look at it this way. Your hands can do pretty impressive things that nothing else in creation can do. But take & sever one nerve so small you can't even see it w/o a microscope & it loses all it's ability. Even the most simple task can't be done because of the pain involved. Suddenly you realize how important that nerve is. You don't have to see it to know.     Maybe it's just a case that yours isn't obvious yet. That God is preparing you. Remember God didn't bring Moses into his ministry until he was 80. I'd bet you're no where close to that age yet.|`|AA11849917	His greatest gift to you was His Son, Jesus Christ, who died on a cross to pay the penalty for YOUR sins.

While there are almost certainly some minor brain structure differences that make it slightly easier for some people to learn certain things, they're very minor compared to what can be accomplished through study and practice.

xHRnhdSWaa	Most households here require two incomes to survive.  If both adults are working then who would be around to care for their elderly members.  Since people live so long now, the care they require toward the end is much more than one person can handle, especially if most of their day is spent at work.  Another good reason is that some people hate their parents and harbor many unresolved resentments toward them for things that happened during their childhood.  Not everyone who has a child is a good mother/father and if they mistreat or neglect their children when they were younger, the children get the opportunity to return the favor later in life when it's the parents who are in need.
YQOT68xFaa	That didn't come from the Bible! That takes Paul's words and changes them. Paul really said that by the disobedience of one man (Adam), sin and death entered the world; and by the obedience of one (Jesus) salvation came.    The Roman Catholic Church has added much to the Bible that is not there. I wonder if they've read those verses in Revelation, the ones that say that anyone who adds to the Bible or takes away from it will be cursed. Hm.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	You left off the part where we refer to her as the "New Eve". Mary was obedient.  Eve was disobedient.  Why is that so wrong to make that conclusion from scripture?  No one is saying that Paul is wrong...he's absolutely correct.  Wasn't there a woman that gave Adam the fruit?  Or was he alone?  If he was wrong, then so would we be incorrect in that statement.    The reason we draw this conclusion is that Mary was not forced to have Jesus.  She had a choice.  She said, "Behold, the bondslave of the Lord; may it be done to me according to your word."  She was obedient.    If you are saying no one is allowed to draw any conclusions from the lessons taught in scripture, then what hope is there for anyone?      No one is saying that Mary is equal to Jesus by this statement, if that is what you are getting at.  Was the woman Eve equal to Adam?  No, but she was still a mother of many wasn't she?    A better question to ask is:  Why is it so wrong in your mind that anyone should give honor and respect to Mary?  Isn't Jesus your brother?   He certainly is mine!  Therefore, isn't Mary your mother?  She certainly is mine!    EDIT:  And why does it matter that Paul mentioned it?   Are you saying that Paul's writings contain everything we need to know?  Then what is the point of the rest of scripture?  What is the need of a Church? Why do you dishonor her by ignoring her all together?  Because Paul doesn't mention her?  Why then is she mentioned throughout the Gospels?  Why is it important that we know He was born of Mary, a virgin, who was obedient to God?  If she is a nobody, why didn't the gospel writers just omit her all together as you do?    EDIT 2:  She gave birth to our Lord.  Isn't that enough?|`|mfSp38yzaa	Isn't it a little obvious? She was obedient. She said yes. She gave birth to Christ...the Savior. Paul is not the end all and be all of Catholic teaching. He didn't write every book in the Bible.    EDIT: No, we look to the Bible as a WHOLE...not only to Paul's writings.    RAC: Why does anyone have to make a preference? As you said, both are true. Because of Eve, death. Because of Mary, Christ (life). Because of Adam, death. Because of Christ (born of Mary), life. No contradiction there.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	I don't know Catholic dogma but the first statement is referring to Eve and Mary whereas the second statement is referring to Adam and Christ.  The Bible is clearly patriarchal in its presentation.  For the church to make a more matriarchal statement, or as Mr. Brown calls it, the worship of the divine feminine, is a curious juxtaposition of doctrine.  Good question.  I am not bothered by the alteration of emphasis from male to female since both positions can be considered correct.  It was Eve that first partook of the fruit and then gave it to Adam.  However, God held Adam responsible because it was his presiding authority that should have prevailed.  That doesn't mean that he could take away Eve's agency, nor should he try.  Rather, that as the patriarch, the buck stops there.  Likewise Mary was chosen to be the mother of Jesus, so by her came hope into the world.  However, it was Christ's work that actually brought about salvation, not Mary.  So of the two positions, I would favor the Biblical emphasis on the male responsibility, not the female.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Lion of judah --- We, as Christians ARE allowed to say things about religion which are not in the bible. We can paraphrase, summarize, and re-state things which are not in the bible.     This is WHAT a teacher does.  Does a teacher ONLY read directly from the Text book?  if so,  what is the point of the teacher, why not merely have everyone read the text book?  The WHOLE point of being a Teacher,  a Parent,  is to EXPLAIN and ELABORATE on points... in order to put things in a way which your students can understand.     Are the 2 Statements in conflict?  Are they completely opposed to each other?  Are they talking about the same person?  Are they hitting on the same principle but from different angles?  COULD they be actually COMPLIMENTING each other. AGAIN I have to caution you that you MAY be reading too much into this verse.    CULTURALLY -- women weren't given much responsibility outside of the home in those days.  IF you blamed a women, you looked weak...like you weren't being a MAN by taking responsibility.   We already know,  by looking at Paul's writings that he had issues with Women.    I believe you even ASKED a similar question on this forum the other day to this affect, about thinking women were scary or not understanding them or something....and how you felt a kinship with Paul on this topic.  -- REMEMBER that?    SO.. ask yourself,  COULD Paul say it was Eve's fault?  could he from a cultural stand point AND from what we know about Paul's other writings?  NOT REALLY.  It would be VERY inconsistent of him to say "thru women, sin entered the world"    ALSO.. WHAT was his point?  What comparison was he going for here?  Was he even TRYING to mention Mary or was his verse about Jesus? Was he trying to point out OBEDIENCE as key, or Jesus as key?  IF his verse was about Jesus, then mentioning Eve would only confuse his point.   Likewise, the Catholic statement is not trying to make a point about Jesus, but obedience. -- therefore, in their INTENT..both are saying the same thing.      SO,  they ARE making the same BASIC point -- that God used symmetry  to fix the issue. How the problem began..is how he decided to fix it.  AND  that it was DISOBEDIENCE that created sin... and OBEDIENCE that forgave it.  -- THAT'S the point.     So the Catholic church is not trying to hold up Mary as a co-redeemer or antying of the sort.  They are MERELY stating that thru ONE disobedience -- sin entered.  Thru one obedience the messiah entered, redeeming us all.      The LIFE they are referring to is Jesus's life.  HE is the redeemer, the sacrifice.  Mary was the vessel.. the HUMAN who COOPERATED with God.  Thru her Obedience,  Jesus came to LIFE.     So the Catholic statement is not infallible scripture but merely a way of stating a point.  YES it mentions Mary,  and we all know that the Catholic church likes Mary more then Protestants.  BUT,  we don't think she is a savior.  Just that thru her obedience,  salvation,  in a way,  came to Mankind in the form of Jesus.  That God used a way in which MANKIND could cooperate with him to bring about their own salvation. That is a wonderful and amazing partnership he allowed us to participate in.  THAT is one of the reasons Catholics like Mary...because she was singled out,  cooperated with God and got to be the MOTHER to God. -- you gotta admit, that is pretty friggin amazing.  She is not the messiah,  but STILL the single most important human (Jesus was God incarnate,  God in human form, but still God)  in all of history.|`|24H5tznkaa	It looks to me that your first verse is talking about Eve and Mary.     The next one sounds like it is talking about Adam and Jesus.    Women being powerful is big no, no. That's why you don't hear a lot about what women did in the Bible. Do you think that men just went around doing everything? Of course not.     It sounds to me that Paul changed the original scriptures because the first set was too geared to women having the power of salvation or destruction to the world.    Just because it wasn't written, doesn't mean that Mary didn't do anything. What is written though, that she gave virgin birth to the son of God who grew up to be a savior is in my opinion, doing a whole lot. Even if she never lifted a hand again after that, God still needed a woman to carry and give birth to his son Jesus and he picked Mary.     Of course, I am speaking in Christian terms, I'm not Christian but if I was, this is how I would see it.|`|C53stbyFaa	Because of Catholics do not read their bibles|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Why do Protestants preach faith alone when faith is mentioned 200 times in the New Testament but never 'faith alone' except in james, where it is condemned?|`|FGcwxZz0aa	It comes from Genesis which prophesied that the woman, Mary the blessed virgin, by saying yes crushed the head of the serpent or destroyed the plan of Satan by her obedience.

Joseph|`|N9VN9bwfaa	"Through one woman's disobedience to God, sin and death came into the world. Likewise through one woman's obedience to God, came life and the hope of salvation. "  The first sentence refers to Eve, through whose disobedience Adam also ended up sinning and eating of that forbidden fruit and thus death came to all people, as your dear Paul does bother to mention.  The second sentence refers to Mary, who obediently gave birth to her son, whom you know to be Jesus, the one who gave life and the hope of salvation to all people.  Had she chosen an abortion to save herself from disgrace -- and yes, women back in her day also sometimes took that option by swallowing certain herbs which I've read about or by pushing pointy objects up the vagina to try to rupture the amniotic sac and so bring about early labor just as they still did in my youth to often horrific ends -- she might have prevented that result.  But she chose instead to listen to that angel and bear that child, come what might, didn't she.  Not amazing, eh?  She risked being "put aside" by her betrothed and disgraced in a day when a young woman so disgraced would never have another opportunity to be wed, when her father or brother might well choose to execute her to save the family name, just as is sometimes still done in the Near East.  No, that wasn't remarkable at all, was it?    She chose to keep a baby she knew wasn't her husband's, a child that an angel had told her was quite special, a child that two prophets also remarked on, shortly after that infant was born.  That wasn't at all special, either, though one of those prophets warned her that the child's life would bring her heartache.  Now, I recall my grandmother warning me, when my own baby was crying away and making me most unhappy, "He's only stepping on your toes now, honey; later on, he'll step on your heart."  And I burst into tears.  But I suppose Mary just took the remarks of two total strangers in stride and thought nothing at all about them.    Then when her son apparently got lost when he was only 12 and was later found, teaching adults in the Temple in Jerusalem as if he were some sort of authority -- that meant nothing at all either.  Now I recall when my little boy showed musical aptitude at about that age.  My heart just swelled with pride so much I thought I was going to burst.  And I went all out trying to see to it that he got piano lessons and that we had a piano -- an expensive item you know.  I never had any musical talent myself, but I sure knew he had it.  It meant the world to me that HE had it.  I was determined he was going to had the opportunity to blossom.  But now I'm sure Mary never did anything like THAT with HER son.  Nosirree.  She probably forced Jesus to spend all his time nailing pieces of wood to other pieces of wood and NOT learning any scriptures, so he wouldn't be able to quote anything from the (Old) Testament later in life.  Because he certainly never did THAT!    Nope.  She was totally unimportant.  Never taught him to love.  Never taught him life was important.  Never taught him to honor his parents.  Nothing like that.    You're right.  She probably laid him on some stoop somewhere and just abandoned him when he was 3.  So we should forget her name altogether.
8jhACvtlaa	Interesting thought, especially because didn't John take her in after the crucifixion?  (Or at least Jesus told him to)    Maybe there were writings about Mary that were lost that we simply don't have now.  Maybe one day we will have more information about her.  Wouldn't that be wonderful?  No doubt she was a very special individual.    But just looking at the Bible, it appears as though there are parts of it that are missing.  Sad day.  (like the book of Enoch mentioned in Jude)    EDIT:  Here are a couple of quotes from the link below, a talk given by an apostle named Bruce R. McConckie.    "In my judgment, Mary is one of the greatest women who has ever lived on earth; the spirit daughter of God our Father. She was chosen to provide a body for his son, who was to be born after the manner of the flesh."    "I think we see in Mary a pattern of piety and submission to the will of the Lord which is the perfect example for all women."    She was a very special individual, chosen to be where she was.  But we limit our worship to God, not her, not Joseph Smith or anything else.|`|XojKYgTQaa	As a critical reader of the Gospels, Luke especially elevates the position of Mary as the bearer of Christ, which entailed Mary being endowed with the Holy Spirit to enable her to carry the holy seed, Christ, so the fact that not much is said about her in the writ tingsof the Apostles reflects the patriarchal nature of their communities.    Women compared to men were not given the proper credit in matters of faith, also canonization of scriptures as a process disadvantaged women, Mary in particular the more!|`|N9VN9bwfaa	I imagine that the main reason PAUL never said anything about Mary one way or the other was that she was dead by the time he was writing.  You know, Paul wasn't there right from the start.  He only came along a fair amount later.  And Mary was not a young lady by the time Jesus ended his ministry.  She must have been around 50 years old when Jesus died.  That was pretty old for that time period, and it was a dangerous time period, especially for Jews.  She was a Jew too, though Christians don't like to hear about that.  She might not have lived much longer after the death of her son, you know.  So, by the time Paul became a Christian -- which was not immediately after the death of Jesus -- there may not have been a Mary for him to write about.      The tradition that I heard was that Mary went with the apostle John into what is now Turkey anyway.  That's not where Paul was most of the time.  So he wouldn't have known her, most likely.  Now I'm hardly an expert on this topic.  But this is what I expect happened.  It was only around 150 years or so after the principle apostles had died that the letters of Paul and the gospels began to be gathered and put together into books.  There were lots of other gospels, early on, and other letters too.  Many have not survived.  So, who knows what all Paul may have said that we never knew about, what all gospels once existed that didn't make it down to our day, and how many books were burned once upon a time.  We only have four canonical gospels and a few letters out of a once great literature -- plus the more recent discoveries of some gnostic gospels, a few later things that came from the Middle Ages, and that set of Dead Sea scrolls.  There was once much, much more.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	I would assume that Mary was still on earth while Peter was preaching and writing his letters.  Paul was obviously alive while Peter was preaching, after all he apparently met him (Galatians 2:11).  So I don't think the Church would have had a set doctrine on Mary at the time of those letters (which is why there are other early Christian writings concerning her that are outside of the bible).  It is no surprise to me that they didn't include the writings concerning Mary when the Church compiled the bible.  There was already concern about heresy in the Church.  At that time it would have been too risky (even today there is heresy concerning her, in that people DO take it too far, but their views and practices are not in line with the churches even if they do call themselves Catholic).|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	Mary really wasn't that important in retrospect of things.

In none of Paul's writings to Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, etc. does he mention Jesus's conception or birth which were pretty dramatic and amazing.    I'm sure if he had known about it he would have added it to his writing because his main aim was to convince everyone that this was the Messiah.    There is a view point that the nativity accounts which are in the first 2 chapters of both Matthew and Luke were added later to substantiate the story.  And that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke originally began at Chapter 3 with the story of John the Baptist, the same as the other 2 Gospels Mark and John who do not mention the nativity and begin straight off with John the Baptist      .|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Because Mary is not the savior.|`|zQyslfHKaa	Because he was busy building mansions.|`|31e3e41e921ac26f4d4f04e1526526d4aa	If they ever got together, "Puff the Magic Dragon" would be released into the world early, and the results of that would be too horrible to contemplate.
YQOT68xFaa	Paul didn't. Jesus Himself didn't give her that reverence! He respected her and loved her but had no reverence for her. She's just a woman, just like me. A sinner saved by grace.     We don't have to say Hail Mary's or worship her or pray to her or believe in her. God never told us to do that; in fact, God tells us that only Jesus is the way of salvation. Mary has nothing to do with it; Jesus died to save her from her sins too. Worshiping Mary, doing penance, praying to the saints, all that peripheral crap is unnecessary for salvation. Salvation is not faith plus works - it is through faith alone, and the works are simply an external proof of our inward faith.|`|076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	Yes. Mary is the earthly mother of God. Nothing more.|`|47sALOGfaa	Small problem with your question/argument.    Jesus, Mary, etc. is all bullshit.

And why is it also used as a football term, and besides, what exactly IS a "hail mary" when talking about football?    Besides, only Jesus can get us to heaven.  Mary didn't die on a cross for my sins; Jesus did that.      Jesus said "No man can come to the Father but by ME!  Anybody trying to enter by any other means will be treated as a thief and a robber, and be cast into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth!"|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Why look at Paul?  Look at Jesus.  While he obeyed her once and turned water into wine you will not see Jesus differ to her again.  In fact several verses seem quite harsh towards her.  I do not believe this means he did not care for her, but perhaps he knew what would one day happen and thus no recorded references were made to bolster this claim.  "Who is my Mother, brothers and sisters?"  "Those who do the will of the Father."  Even at the Cross Jesus gave her into the care of John and called her woman not Mom or even Mary.  He became her Lord and Savior as he was for all.  Mary still hold a special place in history as a faithful servant of the Most High God like Abraham, Moses, Noah, Elijah etc...  No one can intercede for you but Jesus alone.  Those that are living right now can add their voice to your supplications and petition God on your behalf but that is as far as it goes.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	I definitely don't give her special reverence above that which any other believer gets.

LOOK TO THE GOSPELS!|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	No one but Christ is able to bring about our salvation and that is the bottom line in regards to the Catholic church, Mary cannot save in the role of Christ Himself but She can and does intercede for us.  Is Christ God? if you say so then it has to follow that He is greatly offended by sin and if Mary had been a sinner as we are, then this almighty God had to dwell in a sin infested womb, this is something that defies Gods own nature to do.  Not everything  has not been recorded in the scriptures but much can be deduced from them, and for those who have a love of the mother of Jesus I believe that Her virginity and purity from sin are in keeping with Gods plan of salvation.  It was the Angel Gabriel who brought the words of God to Mary and spoke in Gods name and authority when he said`Hail Mary full of grace`where did Mary get this abundance of grace from? so much in fact that She was `Full`  It is a shame that the CJ`s of this world disregard this fact and casually slander the name of Mary so readily.

Mary did her job when she gave birth to Jesus and it ended there. She in heaven right now. She cannot help anyone in any way. We are not to pray to her, but only to Jesus. For His is the only mediator between man and God and the Bible says exactly that.      1 Timothy 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;    Jesus is the only way to haven where the father is... Mary is only the vessel that brought Jesus into this world and nothing more.    John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.     Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

But then many Protestants do not venerate any saints.  They recognize Mary as special but not to the degree that she is venerated by either Catholics or even the Orthodox.  Some Christians would say that Mary is the Mother of God.  Some would not grant her that great a title.  Some pray directly to Mary, some do not.  This is part of the reason that there were schisms very early in the church, even before the schism between Catholics and the Orthodox.  Do you know anything about Nestorius?  Mary's title was one of the sticking points over which he was excommunicated, long ago.  But he became a great missionary in the Eastern Church.  So it's all in one's point of view.|`|v6l3o2kvaa	Ya know I'm happy your finally moving on to different denominations than just Atheist questions.

The fecund female Deity who gives birth to the earth, to the other gods (including the Mythical Christ), and who rules Heaven.     The iconography of the goddess, especially as epitomized in the representations of Isis and her god/son Horus, are the forerunners of the Christian representations of the Virgin Madonna and Child.     As far as the Christian Myth goes...Mary was honored above ALL OTHER WOMEN IN THE WORLD...chosen as the only vessel worthy of housing, for NINE months, the Savior of the World. She did not have to DO anything.  How could you even equate giving birth to a WORLD SAVIOR, with the obvious myths of people raising the dead, or curing the blind and the lame???

She was the one that encouraged Jesus to perform the First Miracle at the Wedding Feast.  Although Mary suffered greatly through the trials of her Son she Never Abandoned God or Christ. Her obedience and Love of God Never wavered.  She's the Perfect Example of the Ultimate Love of Christ in a Human Capacity.

I assume you mean Blessed Mother ... the Mother of God, the ark of the new covenant ... who succeeded where eve failed ...    As an example to us all she was responsible for Jesus first miracle. How? She asked.    She was given the special grace of being born without original sin, otheriwse where being no baptism she would have been struck dead at the moment of conception, as the leivte high presets were when the went behind the curtain to give sacrifice to the first ark and the presence, if they had not properly atoned for any sin they had committed. Blessed mother was given this special grace as she was chosen by God her son for this great honor.  She remained sinless thus succeeded where eve had failed and playing a role in our freedom from sin.  she could have choose sin and thus been struck dead the moment she conceived and thus ruined god's plan as eve had.    She is queen of the saints and yet among them remains the most humble and the most blessed. she is the most important and influential woman who ever lived. without her god's plan would have been foiled as it was with eve.    How is she humble? Well for precisely the reason you don't understand and honor her. Not enough words were written about her in scripture for you, why, humility, the old testament is about the Jews and the new about Jesus she stood aside, yet we know her story and influence both through scripture and form our history(personal relationship with her). and yet words were written about her more so than any other woman, you jsut fail to recognize them becasue you do not underrstand the bible, you misquote misunderstand and misrrepresnt and yet you SHOUT WE SEE WE SEE WE SEE, because you do not recogize and honor the context, and in a manner that recognizes and honors her. Yes, scripture venerates blessed mother. see the quote I began this with, she is mentioned in the old testament crushing the serpents head, and throughout the book of the apocalypse by not only the disciple that Jesus loved but the one whom was given personal responsibility for her care and he did not leave her side  until she was assumed (raptured to you) into heaven. He wrote of her with crown and glory queen of saints queen of angles triumphant over sin and honored above all humans in heaven.  she did nothing? without her there would be no Christians no church and no salvation, she is the greatest woman who ever lived and we honor her we cannot honor her enough.  Hail Mary  Full of grace  Our lord God is inside you  Holy Mary  MOTHER OF GOD  Pray for us  sinners now  and at the hour of our death amen.    She is the model for all women sinless chaste humble.    But yes pelse continue to direspedt Jesus by dishonring his mother and publlically; I pray He shows you mercy at your personal judgment.

The Founding Fathers     Were they deists? In an attempt to hide the Christian founding of America, many teachers and college professors claim that the founders of the United States were not Christians but rather deists who believed in an impersonal Deity but rejected the divinity of Jesus Christ and the inspiration of the Bible. This simply isn't true. Although both Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were what may be referred to as "deists," the vast majority of the remaining founders were unapologetic, born-again Christians. Let's let them speak for themselves.    JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, the Sixth President of the United States, said, "My hopes of a future life are all founded upon the Gospel of Christ..."    JOHN JAY, First Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, said, "Unto Him who is the Author and Giver of all good, I render sincere and humble thanks for His manifold and unmerited blessings and especially for our redemption and salvation by His beloved Son... Blessed be His holy name!" (John Jay's last will and testament)    GEORGE MASON, the Father of the Bill of Rights: "My soul I resign into the hands of my Almighty Creator. Whose tender mercies are all over His works, humbly hoping from His unbounded mercy and benevolence through the merits of my blessed Savior, a remission of my sins."    ROGER SHERMAN, a signer both of the Declaration and Constitution: "I believe that there is one only living and true God, existing in three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost... that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are revelation from God... that God did send His own Son to become man, die in the room and stead of sinners, and thus to lay a foundation for the offer of pardon and salvation to all mankind so as all may be saved who are willing to accept the Gospel offer [and] that at the end of this world there will be a resurrection of the dead and a final judgment of all mankind when the righteous shall be publicly acquitted by Christ the Judge and admitted to everlasting life and glory, and the wicked be sentenced to everlasting punishment. "    SAMUEL ADAMS, Signer of the Declaration of Independence, said, "Principally and first of all, I recommend my soul to that Almighty Being who gave it and my body I commit to the dust, relying upon the merits of Jesus Christ for a pardon of all my sins." (Samuel Adam's last will and testament.)    JOSIAH BARTLETT, Signer of the Declaration of Independence, also said "Firstly, I commit my Soul into the hands of God, its great and benevolent author. "    DAVID BREARLEY, Signer of the Constitution, stated, "First and principally, I commit my Soul unto Almighty God."    CHARLES CARROLL, Signer of the Declaration of Independence, said, "On the mercy of my Redeemer I rely for salvation and on His merits; not on the works which I have done in obedience to His precepts."    GABRIEL DUVALL, selected as a Delegate to the Constitutional Convention and a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, boldly declared, "I resign my soul into the hands of the Almighty who gave it in humble hopes of his mercy through our Savior Jesus Christ."    JOHN HART, Signer of the Declaration of Independence, said, "[T]hanks be given unto Almighty God therefore, and knowing that it is appointed for all men once to die and after that the judgment [Hebrews 9:27]... principally, I give and recommend my soul into the hands of Almighty God who gave it and my body to the earth to be buried in a decent and Christian like manner... to receive the same again at the general resurrection by the mighty power of God."    JOHN DICKINSON, a General during the American Revolution and a signer of the Constitution, declared: "Rendering thanks to my Creator... for my birth in a country enlightened by the Gospel to Him I resign myself, humbly confiding in His goodness and in His mercy through Jesus Christ for the events of eternity." (John Dickinson's last will and testament.)    ROGER SHERMAN, Signer of both the Declaration and the Constitution, "I believe that there is only one living and true God, existing in three person, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the same substance equal in power and glory. That the scriptures of the old and new testaments are a revelation from God and a complete rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy Him."    ROBERT TREAT PAINE, Signer of the Declaration declared: "I am constrained to express my adoration of the Supreme Being - the Author of my existence - in full belief of... His forgiving mercy revealed to the world through Jesus Christ, through Whom I hope for never ending happiness in a future state." (From the Last Will and Testament of Robert Treat Paine, attested May 11, 1814)    GUNNING BEDFORD, Signer of the Constitution declared: "To the triune God - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost - be ascribed all honor and dominion, forevermore - Amen."|`|gebIjqnWaa	All the laws ever written by people is based on the meaning of the 10 commandments. It takes man 50,000 laws to equal the 10 God has instituted and those 10 hang on two, Thy shall love God, and Thy shall love thy neighbor. God did not want them included in the Constitution, so they weren't. The Constitution was inspired of God. Why do you think it is so well written? In the beginning God give man his free agency and to include his ten commandments would have interfered with that freedom. We are here to be proved as to what we will choose to do, without being forced or coerced. It's a great plan.|`|z3fEGkisaa	The first amendment states "there shall be a seperation between church and sate"|`|AA10470367	I think you have missed the entire point of what our founding fathers intended for our country to be. Certainly, one of the prime reasons for the establishment of America was for the freedom to worship as each saw fit - separation of church and state. I have no problem with this as I don't want anyone telling me how to practice my faith. This being the case, it certainly seems to me that if a goal is separation of church and state, then you obviously wouldn't include the Ten Commandments in your Constitution - just common sense. However, in the Constitution check how many time God is mentioned. Again it is oblivious there was a strong belief in God with each citizen having the right to choose HOW they would practice their own faith.|`|IM66g9j1aa	Well there, smart guy, let's put it this way (I'm an atheist by the way), right now we're looking at the supremacy of maybe 3 different ideologies: Atheism, Christianity and Islam. I assume you don't enjoy the thought of little girls being raped by 50 year old men, nor do you relish the idea of them being executed if someone other than their husbands rapes them. So...what do we have? Christianity (where about half of the Christians think Islam is a menace and half think they're just misunderstood), atheism (which seems to do nothing but attack Christianity all day) and Judaism (which seems broken into Zionists and then the liberal ACLU types who'll sell their own granmothers to the imams for a pat on the back). I, a liberal atheist, am siding with the Zionists and the Conservatives.|`|VdifDUGkaa	not all the founding fathers were Christian, and the country was founded on "freedom of religion" so putting in the "laws" of only one religion while allowing for all would be...well, unconstitutional. As it is set up, each of the divisions of government were meant to keep the others in check. They had nothing to do with Christianity and everything to do with equality. Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness but with failsafes so that if a person is impinging on the rights of others he gets reprimanded for it. This being the case, any one religion trying to force itself on others is unconstitutional and therefore all people who are claiming this as a "Christian" nation are breaking the law. think about it.|`|nQPcbjLKaa	America was not founded on Christian principles. It was founded on the principles of freemasonry which is basically satan worship. Thomas Jefferson designed Washington D.C. on a pentagram because it was symbolic of the principles he and the other founders believed in. They were slavers who owned and bred slave women whom they bought and sold off the open slave markets. They were responsible for aiding, abetting, legalizing and encouraging the genocide of the Native Americans, and today the twisted dogmas of Joseph Smith and Hugh Hefner rule. American women have the lowest level of political representation in the world other than Japan, and little access to medical care. America is a hedonistic society where the rape of women and children is common and encouraged by the so-called "feminist" movement. The founding rapists left the 10 commandments out because they were scum. We should have been a Christian monarchy from the start as God intended, and when the candyass "revolution" of the 60's is over, the real revolution will force the jackals from power and justice will dawn at last.|`|t5hp4t79aa	Separation of church and state...

I commute to work at o-dark-thirty, and I saw this car pulled over.  So I stopped and offered the driver a ride to his destination.  "Are you sure?" he said.  As this huge black man got in the passenger seat, I could feel the shocks on my little rice-burner compress.      He told me how he worked nights up in Hartford, CT in a strip club and was driving home. Seeing as how he wasn't very far off from the turnpike, I gave him a ride to his house.  As he got out and thanked me, he said "Are you a Christian?".      "I am," I replied.    "I knew it!" he said, smiling.    I think he expected me to be uneasy or afraid of him because he's big and black.  I wasn't though.  I treated him with simple kindness.|`|lNmyDBjaaa	No|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Actually, not the other day I did just that, with a friend. So... yes :D|`|QE77Oxtqaa	Yes, I am.  I try to do what I can, use my jumper cables, flashlight, phone, and a warm car seat.  I drove an elderly asthmatic home when her and her husbands car started smoking. I drove behind him in case he needed to stop. Turned out to be a friends grandparents. They had pointed me out in Wal Mart to her.  I was driving behind a semi. He had went around a curve, out of my line of sight. When I when around the curve, I saw the semi was upside down in a creek. I called 911, and got out of my car with my flashlight. He was ok, and we waited in my car for the police to show up.    BTW,why do people seem to think they need to pay you for an act of kindness?|`|OKClYfDQaa	I discern.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	Yes, on the moors, but not on the dual carriageway (Thats what breakdown cover is for)  (i also like to pick up hitch hikers)|`|AA11987172	My husband is, and that's one thing I admire most about him...|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Not anymore.

Then I drove what turned out to be 4 deaf college students with a gonner of a car, 1 hour back to their house, then drove back home again.  I felt like a bit of a yutz for doing it when I had an early meeting the next morning & they should have been able to take the subway if I drove them there -- but they begged & I wasn't leaving them it the street or something.    I've stopped other times, but nothing was needed.    I've also been helped.  One person changed a tire for me when I couldn't get the lugnuts off.  Another offered when the starter went bad, to help then tried to pressing me against the car.  Thank goodness he took no for answer even though he seemed surprised.    My sister & I picked up an older lady collecting tin cans along the country road.  She was pretty disoriented & we turned around back where we came from & took her home.      I never stop for hitchhikers & am pretty cautious, but we were glad we stopped to ask this person if she could use a ride.    ===============  Here's a scary one.    I stopped for a car accident since I was right behind it & there were at least 5 cars littered around the highway.  I pulled over & at one car talked calmly to the man who thought he was hurt & passed on the info to the er nurse helping someone else.  Meanwhile - from the side of the road of people watching, one guy was harrassing me nastily that I needed to move my car because I was blocking traffic.  I'm trying to help someone, there's cars everywhere, I'm off the road -- and THIS is what worried him enough to call me names.|`|QcoYdateaa	No, but I will call for help for them. It is just too dangerous to stop.|`|WCo25oFmaa	I have, but never men.  sorry guys.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Yep.|`|2VFR5AKHaa	well i dont drive but when i'm out with my freinds im the kind of guy that makes them stop|`|FB7QVMzQaa	I am very helpful by nature, but I certainly use some discretion.  I will at least phone the local police department to tell them there is a stranded motorist that needs help.|`|c33f9ef3ad647c1a60b1585daa8a07e5aa	Once when I was that stranded person on a busy highway,  a period of an hour went by before someone did stop to let me use their cell phone.  They were the nicest people from two states away, Indiana!  The state patrol was very rude to me and he would not let me use his cell phone to call my children.  Situations where the person is very stressed can be difficult and dangerous for everyone involved.  I can truly appreciate this question.  It can also be very dangerous for someone to stop when they can offer no help, ie. no cell phone.  Thus this is a loaded question.    Would I want to stop, yes.  If it were a busy place in the day and I had someone with me I most likely would.  If the situation were night, I was alone and it was an untraveled road, no.  I would however call the police and report it.    Can we truly ever say that something is black or white?  Not really.  There is always a grey area.    Good question and thank you for causing me to think and remember those things.

Oll0CHkbaa	Well in university and high school you have mass amounts of people in the same general area and situation as you are. You can weed your way through all the possible friend candidates and find some people you really get along with. In the work force, you are restricted to only knowing the people your boss hires, and they will tend to fit into a pattern of the same integral part of their personalities as a personal bias by the hiring boss. These people are the people who share the same feelings toward work that you do and it is a large part of their life. In school, you can see all perspectives of someone because they aren't stuck in a personality-constricting situation. It's not necessarily harder on an academic basis to make friends, you just have to go the extra mile to spend time with people--people who can be exceptionally hard to meet if you spend all your time at work.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	I personaly dont try to make friends at work... Yes it has its perks.. but I like to keep it professional I go to work to work.. not to make friends. I think its easier to make friends in school... you can find true friends when your older... but it is harder.      when your at work. you dont want to interfier your personal life with your work life... people are at work to make money and support their families.. not to make friends... and the people you work with are in a differnt age bracket than you are...     in school.. your just there to learn.. your around more people your age so its easier to connect with someone thats on your level|`|kavhzTXgaa	It's easier during school because you all have one major thing in common.|`|NIUkYdL2aa	It's easier in school.  But if you try when your older there are plenty more people to meet, but you need the courage to approach them.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	yes, it's harder to make a lot of friends but still fairly easy to make A friend    this is because people are getting married and having kids- once they have kids they tend to disappear|`|JGYJXlRGaa	Yes it is harder to make and keep friends as you get older for several reasons, one being kids, and the other work.  Most folks only have time for their kids and work, a social life is hard to maintain...besides that has you get older you get more tired and just can't keep the pace once kept in your younger days.    Also, it is hard to stay friends with people you work with, at least in a bigger urban area.  People are constantly changing jobs, being promoted, and some will use you just to get ahead.  I think the older you are and the higher you get in your workplace the harder it is to trust people and just hang out with folks.
AA11849917	You are wrong on several points.    Belief in faith is not salvation.  That is called "existentialism"    It is belief in God that brings salvation.    We are guilty of breaking God's Laws, and nothing we can do can remove our guilt.    God is offering each and every one of us an undeserved and unmerited pardon if we would admit we are guilty, ask Him to forgive us, and repent of (turn our backs on) our sins.    Only Jesus Christ can forgive us, and we must trust that He did the job properly and completely.    We can "work" (whatever THAT means), but that doesn't "save" us.  It can be used to demonstrate that we ARE saved, but it isn't the cause of salvation, only the effects of being saved.    Again, we do not "believe in faith", we believe in God.  Believe means to put your trust in.  I do not put my trust in my own faith; I put my trust in the completed work of Jesus Christ on the cross when He cried out, "IT  IS  FINISHED!"    Faith IS a gift from God, but all people, everywhere have been given a measure of faith - sufficient for our salvation.    Works will NOT send us to hell.  Doing something OTHER than trusting God - uh - let me rephrase that - TRUSTING God gets us OUT of hell - anything else will NOT get us out.  Nothing SENDS us to hell - that is our judgement for our sins we have already committed.    The Bible says it like this: ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God."  (Joh 3:16-21 English Standard Version)    Here is the same passage from the Revised Standard: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him. He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. For every one that doeth ill hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved. But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God. "    And one last rendition from the Modern King James translation: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him. He who believes on Him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who practices truth comes to the Light so that his works may be revealed, that they exist, having been worked in God. "    So, "works" will not SEND you to hell, they just won't get you OUT of hell.  Only Jesus can get us OUT of hell, and good works ought to follow.    I realize this is long, but I pray that you read all the way through it.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	if ur a protestant yes, protestants do think faith alone can bring u salvation, its called "sola gratia".|`|IqqaA2wIaa	it also takes repentance and being born again.....then you wont doubt....|`|9mLjDa5kaa	1.  Faith alone in Jesus alone is the only  way to be saved.    2.  Works cannot be added to Jesus's perfect salvation (Galatians 1:6-9, and the entire books of Galatians and Romans, and many other places)    3.  You either believe Jesus paid for ALL your sins, or you don't.     4.  Grace is what saves us, faith is the vehicle    5.  Believing is not a work.  Read John 3:16    6.  No.  Read John 3:16    7.

Those who add works are unbelievers.|`|AA12346187	you need to accept Jesus into your heart that is the gift  from God   if  you do that  you would  want to serve him.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	7.  Yes.  Now that means that the gift enables you to do genuine good works, which feeds on itself, which is the answer to 3.    We are not saved by works, which means the act of trying to follow the law, 4.   5.  When you have faith in something bigger than you and the will and plan of that power, that is true faith, and the righteousness belongs to the higher power, not you, 6.    The law was not meant to save, only show you your sin nature and the need to be saved from it.  Without sin there would be no need for the law.  We do not have the power to save ourselves.  So we need faith in something that can save us through what was done on the cross. The gift is that you are given to know and can now grow in faith, with hope and living no longer by sinful desires (because the end of such a life is death), but with a new motivation (because the end of such a life is the promise of life)  Faith now produces good works because in faith we have received a promise and live anew.|`|3ZzlrChgaa	By Grace Alone Through Faith Alone in Christ Alone    Faith comes by reading the word and the word is a gift of God.    Romans 10:17  Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.    Faith produces good works.

It is like a marriage contract.  Take YAHOSHUA's name, follow His rules (Torah), and you become His 'bride' and He saves you.  If you think you can earn eternal life (legalism) you are lost.  If you think you will be accepted while you choose disobedience, you are lost.|`|762fd848c7be39ffa61d980d33368b2baa	not eternal life, just bliss and happyness|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	Faith and Works      "Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 7:21).     "Why do you call me "Lord, Lord," and not do what I tell you?" (Luke 6:46).     "For he will render every man according to his works . . ." (Rom. 2:6-8).     "For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified" (Rom. 2:13).     "For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful prospect of judgments . . . (Heb. 10:26-27).     "What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him?" (Jas. 2:14).     "So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead" (Jas. 2:17).     "But some one will say, You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my faith. . . .Do you want to be shown, you foolish fellow, that faith apart from works is barren? (Jas. 2:18-20).     "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone" (Jas. 2:24).|`|uD8d5V9Saa	Faith alone saves.  Works will not save.   4 is correct.

Unbelief makes man into an extremely impotent beast.|`|500b0fe5bfd90198931c2235e47b33efaa	Faith is not a noun, but an active verb, therefore your statement make no sense whatsoever.    Our works spring from a regenerated spirit and demonstrate our faith in the completed work of Christ on the cross and through his resurrection.  Romans says that if we believe in our hearts that God raised Christ from the dead and our mouths confess this, we are saved.    Martin Luther had a pretty good definition of faith. http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text... has a translation from German into English that touches your issue concisely.|`|P6atY3xXaa	Do you know the little song about the wise man who built his house on the rock and the storm couldn't destroy it?  And the foolish man who built his house on sand and all he had was destroyed and he lost his life in the storm.    Did you know BOTH of them were Christians?    Matthew 7:  KJV  24Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:      25And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.      26And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:      27And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.     Notice both men heard Jesus' teachings.  The one built on the rock (true Christian) did not do them and was destroyed.  He fell with the end of the old world of Satan's.  See versese 21-23 there also.    The Bible repeatedly shows that faith or belief alone cannot ever save us.  Some verses here.    Philip. 1  KJV  29For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;     James 1  KJV  21Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.      22But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.      23For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:      24For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.      25But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.      26If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.     Hebrews 10:  KJV  26For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,      27But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.      28He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:      29Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?      30For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.     1 Peter 4  KJV  17For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?      18And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?     Hebrews 5  KJV  9And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;     There are 2 kinds of works in the Bible (besides works of law)....one is outward righteousness works such as doing a lot of charity work, donating money, volunteer work, seeming to cast out demons or perform miracles, etc.  May appear righteous, but doesn't mean you are not a worker of iniquity (sin).    The second kind is the work and suffering it takes to OBEY Jesus commands, to be a doer of the word....to get off alcohol, to stop doing gross wrongdoing of any kind (fornication, false teaching, idolatry, pagan beliefs, stealing, drugs, etc).    The look good righteous on the outside works can't save you no matter how many you have, but believer or not, if you do not have the works of suffering to obey Jesus, then you will be judged as unfit to serve him and cast out.    Hence, there are MANY scriptures that say God judges his people, that judgment STARTS with us (true Christians) and they are judged more harshly than non believers.    So no faith alone cannot save you.  You must obey if you want salvation.    James 2  KJV  14What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?   17Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.   24Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.   26For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.      Luke 6  KJV  46And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?      47Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:      48He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it:|`|jC2tOaPFaa	"you should know and not believe"  - BM|`|8e35f8f7c61bfe408de6b89c171fd161aa	Faith in God is what SAVES you. It is not however what gains you your salvation. Faith is the gate so to speak, while works is the path to salvation. James says that a faith without works is dead. Jesus said in Matthew that the gate is strait and the path is narrow. Hebrews says that faith is believing without seeing. The author goes on to list many who lived by faith. Faith is not a gift from God. It originates from man, which is why it is so unique among mankind. Self righteousness only comes from assumption, which is a dangerous form of faith. It stems from the lack of works in your life, in which you assume that God will still do what He promised, even though you aren't doing what you promised.    I say again: A faith without works is dead. I don't do good works to BE saved, I do good works because I'm saved.   In James:  Jas 2:14  What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?   Jas 2:15  If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,   Jas 2:16  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?   Jas 2:17  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.   Jas 2:18  Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.   Jas 2:19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.   Jas 2:20  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?   Jas 2:21  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?   Jas 2:22  Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?   Jas 2:23  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.   Jas 2:24  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.     Read James 2:18 and 24, and don't listen to anyone that says that faith alone saves. They're lying to you, ignoring James completely.|`|IVHyKRCCaa	First question, it's Yes, faith alone can save you but the question is true faith in God.  In the Bible, it is written that if you have a faith as little as mustard seed you can move mountains.  So analyze your faith.  If you really have faith in God and you believe in God, you will follow the teachings of God and God's two greatest commandments was 1) Love the Lord your God with all your strength and all your might and 2) Love your neighbor as yourself.  So if your faith is real, the good work follows.    2nd Q, if you do good work, your faith is real and you will be saved but if you don't do good work, it only means that you don't have faith.|`|U4MyeZd2aa	Ok. If you believe in God and try to live your life the way He wants you to , then you will be saved. I dont know anything about "protestants" or anything like that.

This is why the sheep are bleating and this is why the confusion.    I therefore invite everyone to read this Free Christian book titled, "Have you been Born Again of the water and the Spirit" by going to www.nlmnewzealand.com and ordering it. Its absolutely Free!!    Jesus said to Nicodemus Israels leader who himself had no clue to this Q, saying to him in John 3:3-5, "Unless a man is born again of water (not our baptism) and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven."    We thus need to understand this full and complete atonement for sin by our Lamb of God and believe in it by faith. This gospel is the correct gospel, and the gospel that is preached today is not, this is why many people are in confusion like Nicodemus.    Its tantalizing to read all these conflicting answers to a simple Q. Is God a divided God, would He say one thing and then go against Himself by saying another thing?  Have you ever wondered why the church is so divided? All true born again people have the same testimony and when they share their faith, you can hear that they all speak from the same script.  But sinner christians today who have no clue to this Q, all think they know something, but when you read all their answers then you can just throw your arms up in total frustration!!!!

5vqo3XzHaa	I've had two profound dreams:    1) I was standing in a room filled with people, when I heard a shout from above, looked up and saw Jesus with His arms outstretched.  All of a sudden, people around me started rising up to meet Him.  I remember feeling very apprehensive, wondering if I were going to be left behind, when I started rising up too.  I was so happy, and could hardly wait to touch Him.  I had this dream at a time in my life when Satan was trying to get me to doubt my salvation.    2) I remember seeing in my dream a man, though I couldn't see His face, I just knew it was Jesus.  One by one, people were coming forward to stand in front of Him.  I could hear no words spoken, but I  saw some of the people turn into beautiful lights and disappear out of my view.  The others turned into like wisps of smoke and descended downwards.  As I was watching this scene unfold, I remember wondering to myself what happened to the wisps of smoke.  The next thing I saw was what I can only describe as a huge crater, and the bottom of it was filled with fire that was boiling.  I remember looking up and seeing the wisps of smoke, which then turned back into actual people, and most were falling into this crater filled with boiling fire.  Some of the people managed to cling to the sides of the crater, but there was no way for them to climb up.  I knew it was just a matter of time before they, too would fall into the fire.  I could hear them screaming for help, but there was no way I could help them.  I remember feeling a sorrow I had never felt before for these people.  I started crying and praying for these people, but at the same time I knew there was no hope for them.  Then I woke up with a start, and had to wipe the tears from my eyes, as I had actually been crying during this dream.|`|RJRantBfaa	My father, telling me to get ready for a major change.

Then in my mind was the vision of...the world is where God's church is.    The body of Christ is you catholic , you mormon , you SDA, and so on.  God has His chosen people everywhere in the world.  NO one sect is THE Church of God.  Each sect is but a PART of the body of Christ.  So let us humble our selves in the sight of the Lord and He will lift us up.    Now and in the end we have the choice as to weather we will keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Christ Jesus.  Now or sooner is better than later of course but if one chooses to stay in where they are it will be a good thing to share the truth of Sabbath worship with others that way they to will have the chance to choose themselves as to what day is the proper Day.

Dreams, of course, can be sent by the Holy Spirit [inspired]; they can be our own imaginings; ... or some can also be demonic-nightmares and fearful or tormenting dreams.    I rarely have a dream that I recall that stands out as being inspired from the Holy Spirit. but my wife has such dreams on a fairly regular basis being as she definitely has a prophetic gifting and calling. Here is one that was fairly recent and very significant:    * While sound asleep, she sees herself looking up into the sky and sees A LARGE DOOR in the clouds that is very near to closing; just a tiny crack of light is seen as the door completes its closure just before she wakes up.    * The clear interpretation we got of this dream was that THE DOOR OF GRACE AND OPPORTUNITY IS CLOSING for millions and millions of souls who have blasphemed GOD and turned Jesus away just one time too many. THERE IS STILL a small space of opportunity to receive grace and be saved, ... but it is closing soon to be sealed by the Sovereign Power of GOD.     People had better wake up and get right with GOD FOR REAL. No one will be turned away *who seeks GOD sincerely and earnestly* ... but many have already sealed their fate.

EJHhCDcaaa	Following Russell's death, a controversy arose concerning the practices of the new president of the Society, and a widespread schism erupted, dividing the movement. The majority of the membership broke away, eventually resulting in the formation of several smaller groups who retained the name, Bible Students, while those who remained in fellowship with the Watch Tower Society took on the name Jehovah's Witnesses. Several denominations later formed around, or adopted some style of, Russell's views, among them the Worldwide Church of God, the Concordant Publishing Concern and the Assemblies of Yahweh. Off-shoot groups of the Bible Student movement include the Pastoral Bible Institute and the Layman's Home Missionary Movement.

Off-shoot groups of the Bible Student movement include the Pastoral Bible Institute and the Layman's Home Missionary Movement.  He served as an elder and traveling speaker in the following years. In April 1915, he represented the Bible Students in a debate on the subjects of the state of the dead and Christ's Second Coming with Baptist clergyman Rev. John H. Troy.[6] He was elected President of the Watch Tower Society on January 6, 1917, two months after Russell's death. The election process was questioned by some Bible Students, including four members of the Board of Directors. These differences between Rutherford and the Board were the first in a long line of controversial actions which led to a widespread schism that peaked by 1928. It turned out that although the four opposing directors had been appointed by Brother Russell, these appointments had never been confirmed by vote of the corporation members at the annual meeting of the Society. On August 8, 1917 the disgruntled ex-directors and their supporters left the Bethel family; they had been asked to leave because of the disturbance they had been creating. At the annual meeting held on January 5, 1918 Rutherford received the most votes for board membership and was named as president of the Society. [7]    In Pastor Russell's 1910 version of his Last Will and Testament he named Rutherford as one that he considered suitable to be chosen as an initial member of a rotating editorial committee of five elders who were to oversee what material was to appear in the Watch Tower magazine following Russell's death. The committee was to see to it that the Watch Tower magazine contain only material written by Russell during his lifetime.[8]    As you can see that din't happen.  It was Judge Rutherford whom is responsible for many of the false doctrine the JW's adhere to today.  You will also notive that during the time of Charles Taze Russell, he was considered the Faithful and discrete slave, long before the 1919 date that Jesus "supposedly" appointed them "the Organization" as the faithful and discrete slave, however it was Judge Rutherford whom acted in this capacity until his death in 1942.|`|cR8UZdi1aa	Why do you keep asking such ignorant questions, Nina?|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	Actually Russell didn't want Rutherford to take over for him.

However, serious research is difficult to do when chasing after a 14-month-old!

If you think Jesus lied, then yes they are a false faith.  If you think Jesus was telling the truth, then since the Jehovah's Witnesses accept Jesus as their lord and savior they must be as Christian as anyone else who accepts the terms set down by Christ.    I hope this helps people be more tolerant of others.|`|AA11297267	"False teachings" based on what assumption of truth?    Every religion interprets the world as particular people see it, or they interpret "holy" writings as they see them.  Most of the time, one interpretation is as valid as any other, because all of them are based on assumptions without facts or evidence to support them and are equally worthless as far as real explanations of anything.  That so many groups interpret the bible so differently is simply the result of the fact that the bible is ambiguous and self-contradictory -- it lends itself quite nicely to a wide variety of interpretations.    For example, JW's claim that jesus was crucified on a "tree" and not a cross.  They base that claim on possible interpretations of the original language of the gospels.  Based solely on that criteria, their claim has some merit -- the gospels *did* use words that could indicate "tree" just as well as "cross," as they mostly refer to "something made of wood."  This offends other christians who have made the cross the symbol of their devotion, so they dismiss JW claims out of hand as "false" despite the fact that their claim does have some merit.  If you look at the wider historical perspective and don't limit yourself to just the bible, Roman records are quite clear that the Romans were quite happy to nail people to whatever happened to be handy at the time -- a cross made from timbers, a plain wooden pole with no crossbar, or even a tree.  So basically there's really no way to independently verify either interpretive claim.    But does it really matter?  Different sects look for minor things they can disagree with other sects on as tenets upon which to base their beliefs -- one of those in the JW case is saying the other christians have it all wrong, jesus was hanged on a tree, not nailed to a cross.  That lets them set themselves apart from the other christians, and claim to have some kind of "truth" that the other sects do not.  But it's a minor thing, and really of no consequence.  When you consider that the gospels aren't writings from direct experience anyway, that none of the gospel writers ever saw any of the events they wrote about or heard jesus utter a single word, is it really important to argue over minor points of interpretation among writings that have no validity to begin with?  It's like arguing over what kind of frosting -- butter cream or powdered sugar -- is on a cake that was never made.  Since there was never a frosted cake in the first place, what point is served by arguing about what kind of frosting it might have had if it had existed?    The evidential grounds for all of the arguments is non-existant.  Which makes the fights over minor doctrinal points among catholics, protestants of all flavors, mormons, JWs, and everybody else nothing but frosting on a cake that was never made.  Pure silliness.    Peace.|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	Absolutely! If the Bible has any false teachings or flip flops in God's pronouncements, then of course they are.

The entire concept of "God's organization" is something concocted by men in order to control other men.    Personally, I prefer Jesus' words "wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be also."|`|VxTKNbJRaa	Many Jehovah's Witnesses are not unaware but are so stuck in the Watchtower organization they are fearful of leaving because of the consequences of being disfellowshipped.  &  Many Jehovah's Witnesses are so intelligent and yet are deceived.|`|ZRQcM64Faa	I always here JW's brag about "being in the truth" yet the WT society has made it clear that it is OK to LIE if it advances the cause of the kingdom (Read the WT society)  Odd it is not...the religion of truth is much like the religion of peace?   The religion of peace calls for holy wars against Jews and Christians while the religion of "truth" OK's lying!       THE TRUTH is Jesus Christ.  Jesus said that many would be thrown out of their synagogues  if they came to HIM for salvation.  They will also be thrown out of the Kingdom Halls.   Is it not better to ditch the Tower and come to JESUS for real salvation?    EDIT:  Po?? V?ss??  said they do not engage in war.  I guess you have never heard of a place called Jericho?  How about David and Goliath?   Did Israel sin when they went to battle against their enemies?  You may want to read Deuteronomy chapter 20 for the answer.   But let's move up to 1940.  Should we have just let a man named Hitler murder millions of people without lifting a finger?  How about YOU today?  What would you do if you saw someone beating a small child and you knew they were going to kill that child?  Would you just turn your head and walk away if you had the power to stop it?  Then again, I guess the NWT does not have Romans 13: 4 in it.      You also said that you serve the only TRUE God.Jehovah.   By pure logic, since the WT does state that Jesus is a god, that has to make Jesus a FALSE god since there is only ONE true God.  Of course, this does make sense doesnt it since Isaiah declares that there is no other god beside Jehovahbut throughout Isa. 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46 we can see that JESUS is the living fulfillment and is indeed."the word became flesh and dwelt among usGOD.WITH us!|`|EJHhCDcaaa	Not at all.  Their teaching is that Jesus returned in 1914 to begin his  Second Coming or invisible presence in fulfillment of Matthew 24:3. Then in 1918 he began to make an examination of all the religions claiming to represent him to see if any of them had been faithfully and discreetly providing true teachings of the Bible (spiritual food) at the proper time during his absence. They say that the only religion he found doing so was the Watchtower Society and therefore Jesus  appointed them over all his earthly interests or belongings in the spring of 1919. Notice that the only reason Jesus would have made the  above appointment is if he had found them providing spiritual food at the proper time. Their Gods Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached book explains this very critical point under the heading Time of Inspection by the Slaves Master.  And so Jesus would make his decision in 1919 based upon what they had been teaching down till 1919. He would check the quality of those teachings to make sure they were the right things to be teaching and the right time to be teaching them (the right sort of food at the proper  time). What was Jesus decision? The book simply asserts that they met the test. This then is the very precise way they interpret and apply Matthew 24:45-47. This is the only official basis for  their claim to being Gods faithful and discreet slave organization  and the only true religion today. And so when Jehovahs Witnesses are asked, Why do you believe the Society is Gods organization, they all should answer Because of Jesus appointment in 1919 in fulfillment of Matthew 24:45-47.  (The Most Important Event in Watchtower History)  If Jesus acknowledged the Society as his faithful and discreet slave organization and therefore appointed them over all his earthly interests in 1919 then there is at least a chance that they are still Gods organization today. But if he didnt make that appointment in 1919 then there is no chance no matter what they are teaching today.32 There is only one way to know what decision Jesus  would have made in 1919. Therefore according to their interpretation,  there is only one way to know if the Society could be Gods organization today: By examining the same teachings they say Jesus examined in 1918-1919 to see if they could have passed such an  exam. Jehovahs Witnesses have never done this.     Witout going through all the teachings of the JW's many of the teachings today are so different than prior to 1918-1919 date.  If they passed the test then, they must have the wrong teachings today.  However, they have this light gets brighter theory that tells them they have the correct teaching today.  That means they didn't have it back then.  many of there teaching that was going on before the 1918-1919 date were like the date that Jesus came to earth, invisible in 1874 and Arrmogeddon was to be in 1914.  This all changed way after the 1918-1919 date.  This is just one of the many failed doctrines that they had back then.  So in light of their failed doctrine, how could Jesus appoint them, he could not.  This is a man made doctrine to exploit the members and this was the Doctrine of a Judge.  Look into the history Judge Rutherford and see if you would belive in him?|`|BzrUWCsDaa	False teachings?    You mean like the ungodly Trinity doctrine?

A more pointed question might retort, "What happened to JEHOVAH when He came here as Jesus, according to trinitarianism?"    Regarding alternate names of Jesus, other questions follow...  What happened to Immanuel while Jesus was on earth?  What happened to Sprout (or Branch or Shoot) while Jesus was on earth?  What happened to the Greater David while Jesus was on earth?  What happened to Logos (The Word of God) while Jesus was on earth?  What happened to 'Faithful and True' while Jesus was on earth?    Bible students have long recognized that "Michael" is simply another name for Jesus. Perhaps the questioner is unaware that the Scriptures explicitly refer to Jesus as "archangel" (and that Bible term is ALWAYS used in the singular).  .. ..(1 Thessalonians 4:14-16) Jesus died and rose again, so, too... the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel's voice    Should a Christian be troubled at the Bible teaching that Jesus is the "archangel"? No. The Bible also refers to Jesus as an apostle, yet it is beyond obvious that Jesus is higher than any mere apostle. Or high priest for that matter!  .. ..(Hebrews 3:1) Consider the apostle and high priest whom we confessJesus.    Jehovah's Witnesses do happen to believe that Michael is Jesus, but the idea is hardly central to their faith. It is just that a child can recognize what the Bible says about the idea... Is not Jesus Christ the primary "Seed" who defeats Satan? The Millennial Rule begins with Satan's abyssing, performed by Christ Jesus, and no mere subsidiary. Thus, when Revelation 12:7-9 tells us that "Michael" performs this work, Jehovah's Witnesses are convinced that "Michael" is simply another name for Jesus, just as "Immanuel", "Sprout", "David", and "The Word" are additional names of Jesus (see Matt 1:23 ["Immanuel"]; Zech 6:12 ["Sprout", "Branch", or "Shoot"]; Ezek 37:24,25 ["David"]; Rev 19:13 ["The Word of God"]).  .. ..(Genesis 3:15) He [the Seed of God's woman] will bruise you [the original serpent Satan] in the head  .. ..(Revelation 12:7-9) Michael and his angels battled with the dragon... So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan  .. ..(Revelation 20:1-3) And I saw an angel... And he seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he hurled him into the abyss  .. ..(Revelation 20:6-7) Rule as kings with [Christ] for the thousand years.      Does the questioner feel compelled to insist that Jesus is above mere angels? Jehovah's Witnesses agree!    Despite the misconceptions of Christendom, the Bible itself teaches that there is one single solitary archangel, the lone "Chief of the Angels". By definition, every mere angel would be lesser than that archangel. Thus, Jehovahs Witnesses insist that it would be incorrect to believe that Jesus was a mere angel on a par with other angels. Even before he came to earth and was impaled, Jesus the Son enjoyed a position higher than any other creature in existence because of two different reasons.    Firstly, as the firstborn of creation, Jesus likely spent thousands or millions or billions of years in exclusive association with Jehovah; this unique opportunity allowed Jesus to learn so much that Jesus is spoken of as the "image" and "reflection" and "exact representation" of Almighty Jehovah God.  .. ..(Colossians 1:15) [Jesus] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation  .. ..(Hebrews 1:3) [Jesus] is the reflection of [Jehovah's] glory and the exact representation of his very being    Secondly, the Bible teaches that Jesus worked alongside Jehovah to CREATE the other angels (and the rest of the heavenly and physical universe).  .. ..(Colossians 1:15-18) By means of him all other things were created in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, no matter whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All other things have been created through him and for him. 17 Also, he is before all other things and by means of him all other things were made to exist, 18 and he is the head of the body, the congregation. He is the beginning  .. ..(Revelation 3:14) These are the things that [Jesus] says, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God [see 2 Cor 1:20]   .. ..(Proverbs 8:22) Jehovah himself produced me as the beginning of his way, the earliest of his achievements of long ago.  .. ..(John 1:1,14) In the beginning [Jesus] was... So [Jesus] became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father; and he was full of undeserved kindness and truth.    As the agent of creation for the other angels, who better than Jesus to be their "Chief"? Interestingly, the Scriptures refer to *ALL* angelic spirit creatures as "morning stars".
0aN1xIxfaa	The Bible gives the definition. It's in Isaiah chapter 43 where God addresses Jacob - Israel - the nation He brought out of Egypt and redeemed. They witnessed His miracles and His redeeming grace, and entered into covenant relationship with Him. So God says to them:    "You are my witnesses, and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me. I, even I, am Jehovah, and apart from me there is no saviour." (vss 10-11) So God appointed the fleshly nation of Israel to be His witnesses, and they were all in the old covenant.    Strangely, those who call themselves Jehovah's Witnesses today deny that Jehovah is the only God and the only Saviour, because they say Jesus is a demi-god and a secondary saviour. They also say only 144,000 people from the time of Christ till today can ever enter into the new covenant Jesus inaugurated, and so become spiritual Israelites. This group adopted the name in 1931 at an assembly in Columbus, Ohio. They were told the name was the wage Jehovah was giving all his workers who had been bringing in the harvest (based on Jesus parable of the workers all getting a penny at the end of the day and belief that the harvest era was about to close).|`|RMMdGYCDaa	A devout cultist.

Jehovah comes from the Hebrew consenants YHVH (LORD) and the vowels come from the Hebrew Adonai (Lord). Since the vowels aren't known for sure. But since following languages either didn't have a Y or an I, they used J.  Because the J can have a Y sound, or I sound in different languages.    So Jehovah is really from the Holy Bible also secret code YHVH for the LORDs Name.    So the real definition of being a Jehovah Witness would be to Witness for Jehovah.    The problem with the religion Jehovah Witnesses, is that they deny that Jesus is the Word of God in the beginning, by claiming that Jesus was the first Angel (winged Cherebim, Son of God) in heaven.

True Christians would make known the personal name of the Most High God, Jehovah (Ps.83:18 KJV).    God had His name Jehovah  (Heb.: Yahoweh) placed almost 7,000 times in his Word. Obviously, He wanted his children to use and respect that Name! If a child doesnt know his fathers name, what does that make him?    Jesus was called the Faithful Witness (Rev.1:5; 3:14). In his model prayer Jesus placed first in importance the wish for that name to be holy (Mt.6:9). The name Jesus in Hebrew (Jehoshua) means Jehovah is Salvation. One of the most important things Jesus did was to make his fathers name known to his followers, so they could have Gods love (Jn.17:6,26). True Christians do what Christ did so they would also use and make the Fathers name known.    The Scriptures clearly teach that True Christians would be identified by the name Jehovah (Acts 15:14; Amos 9:11, 12).    Jesus parting instructions to his followers were: Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you (Mat.28:19, 20). No one can truly fulfill the Christian commission without using the Eternal Divine Name Jehovah (Ex. 3:15).    Jesus said that he would write the name of his God on the forehead of his chosen ones (Rev.3:12) indicating their gaining approval and salvation.    In the Bible only Satan refuses to use the name Jehovah, yet today almost all Bible translations have removed that Name from Gods own Word. In doing this they receive the strongest condemnation (Rev. 22:18,19). How can someone who is under this curse be trusted to teach the truth?    Only Jehovah's Witnesses properly imitate Christ in this and thus meet the requirements of being truly Christians. They are not under Revelation's curse of spiritual darkness for having removed the most hallowed name from their bible.    This is just one aspect or doctrine which would identify a True Christian. Jesus said that you would know True Christians by the love they show (Jn.13:34,35), and by the result (fruits) of their teachings (Mat.7:16-23). When you examine religions who do not use the Divine Name you find that they cannot meet any of the other requirements of true Christianity. Their historical record is of bloodthirsty wars, immorality, sectarian violence and factional splits (Mat.7:21- 23; 2Tim3:5; Gal.5:19-23). Today Catholics continue to kill Catholics and Protestants kill Protestants, something true Christians would not do (1Jn.3:10,15; 4:8). Our hearts tell us that any religion who is willing to shoot their own members in warfare cannot possibly be trusted to teach Biblical truth.    I have found only one group which has presented absolute evidence of truly being Christian: Jehovah's Witnesses. This is the testimony of the Holy Spirit (1Cor. 6:9-11; Gal.5:19-22).

The name was changed by their second president Judge Rutherford in the early 1930's.  It was a name change only.  It has nothing to do with being a witness of Jehovah's as some may state but just the name of Jehovah's witnesses.  They are an offshoot of the Adventists movement from the latter 1800's with many of the same doctrinal beliefs.  In fact their first connection with the Adventists is with a man named Barbour, whom Russell got together with and came up with this false doctrine of Jesus invisible presence in 1874, which later was changed to 1914, which is a whole other false doctrine and story in it's self.   They claim to be the only true channel of God as claimed this happened in 1918-1919 while Jesus was here on earth "invisibly" he appointed the Watchtower Organization as the only true christian organization with the right teaching at the right time.  Then, depending on whom you speak with in this Organization, Jesus went back to heaven and was made King of Heaven.  This too was invisible.      So in a nutshell, the Jehovah's Witnesses are an offshhot of the Adventists and were once know as Charles Russells Bible students, that now belive that their Organization is the chosen one.  They are also know to teach the doom and gloom, as many cultist's do, that the end of the world is near and they have made many prediction as to the year and the season in which this was going to happen.  There have been many cults that came from the Adventists movements which in turn also claimed Armageddon at certian dates and seasons.|`|oiHiCuJxaa	What is a definition of real Jehovah's Witnesses?

Our leftovers were made into soup too, mashed potatoes, veggies, rice was thrown in there and they always turned out so good and cleaned out the fridge. My mom got p/o'ed one time because she would always by watermelon and no one would end up finishing it. She had a nice big pot of broccoli soup (my favourite) and whipped the watermelon in making a nasty mess. That's by far the weirdest soup that my house has ever made. It turned me away from soup for a while.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I accidentally dropped a bunch of change in my soup once and just kept eating it until I almost swallowed a nickel.|`|i4Vt4YJ4aa	I try to care what goes in my stomach, so nothing yet.|`|Fy9Muy6Waa	While we, as Westerners, would think it strange, the Arabs I made it for did not find it strange..... the strangest soup I've ever made was Sheep's head soup. Yes, the whole head, skin removed, eyeballs still in it, cut open lengthwise and rinsed out really good. Dried lemon, garlic, and cardamom to flavor all poured over big dryish flat breads and slopped up.     eww ewwww EWWWWWWW  but they like it|`|JGYJXlRGaa	I have put Maryland Blue Crab in a soup before, and I don't mean just the meat I mean the entire crab.  I was over a friends house and we just grabbed everything from the frig and threw it in the pot.  It was actually pretty good.|`|yEqEbVWOaa	I'd get deleted if I answered the first part.    Second part:  I would say we eart it the same.|`|20d09b00f62ad79a5e4a77484ecead92aa	Funny that you ask...with this cold weather and all.  My daughter and I were actually making soup and as I was cutting up the potatoes, I cut my finger.  Ouch!  Chloe freaked out and I cleaned up the mess and I told her I always put a little piece of me in my soup!  Now it's a running joke every time I make homemade soup!! If there is someone who doesn't know the joke, she is sure to tell them of the special ingredient!!  You should see the look on their faces!!|`|N73oZyY8aa	Hey FFG, I do ketchup in soup too!

qbb9YiRsaa	when i try to figure out the answer, the only real reason i can come up with is that its the only part with the least amount of padding so they can FEEL the pat?  If you patted a fellow football player on the shoulders like they might do in other sports, they wouldn't feel it or maybe even know you were there because of how huge those shoulder pads are...    and they're all secretly gay :P|`|AA11672481	Never look a gift horse in the mouth, I always say.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	You mean its not acceptable to smack other men on the butt?

0FXVTZf7aa	Interesting point.  I'm a Christian and I agree only a cruel God would create our bodies and minds and wire us to be so darn sexual then turn around and tell us it's a sin.  But I'm part of an alternative Christian movement that challenges the traditional thinking about premarital sex in the Bible.  One good reference is the website below.|`|LUiiAlsJaa	Its a myth so it will never make sense in reality|`|bWcJqSSbaa	he created a sin so we could have a choice|`|eUEgi111aa	They will ignore you and just go on about free will. Just sayin'.|`|RbUbMTqOaa	we create sin and he forgives us for it blame it on free will not GOD|`|a5c0fefc19fa6c84053d58f21fa14d8eaa	Well:  You say you know that God gave us free will.  In giving us free will He gave us the chance to CHOOSE.  Adam and Eve had the CHOICE not to eat the forbidden fruit, but they did. That is how sin started.  He gave us that chance hoping that we would do what we knew was right with the free will.  That "very strong biological urge" you speak of was built into us not to be abused and used before marriage, but so that we find the person we love and enjoy it AFTER marriage.|`|UPD45e9Naa	god gave us the gift of free will so we can do wat we want but we should listen to him and sin came about when eve ate from the tree of knolge (disobaying god) and gave some to adam and that gave them knoldge of everything even bad thing and some of those bad things looked fun so it tempted man to do it|`|vxzyYVeYaa	Built in all of us is Self-Control. Yes sex is something that Jehovah God put in all of us, however, it must be done in the proper way.....being married.    So God does not create anyone or anything that is wicked. Neither does he tempt anyone to do evil. Said Jesus half brother James: Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. (Jas. 1:14, 15) The angelic son who became Satan, therefore, let his own selfish desire entice him into wickedness. We can see from this example that we should immediately dismiss wrong desires that come into our minds, or that are put before us. Entertaining the desire nourishes it, and it will become fertile and bring forth sin, to our sorrow.    Keep your senses, be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. But take your stand against him, solid in the faith, knowing that the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished the entire association of your brothers in the world.1?Pet. 5:8, 9.|`|n9PUzlhzaa	For the test of human beings.

Sin is the absence of morality just as darkness is the absense of light and cold is the absense of heat.    If you, like me, are as disgusted with all the wickedness in this world today, then move closer to God.  But don't complain about a problem when you are part of the cause!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You are wonderful proof that sin comes to its height when it perverts our moral judgment. Your argument is maybe an argument for there being a lot of people in Hell but not for the necessity of sin !!!    You went from 'we have free will' to 'Its [sic] not ...free will'.     Readers, beware, we have what Jesus warned about, the person justifying their sin. Stay away unless you know this error.|`|AA10067344	If temptation did not exist, what value would there be in morality?|`|pPhy6JVDaa	to make life fun and interesting..without Sin, life would suck!|`|NIUkYdL2aa	He didn't create Sin. He gave Adam and Eve a choice to have sin in the world or not but they disobeyed him by eating the apple and in came the sin.|`|AA11737190	All organisms (at least all that didn't die out really, really quickly) have survival and reproductions as their two main functions. Why should we be any different?|`|U24VtSlZaa	God has a well-developed sense of irony?    Seriously, anyone who pretends to know "why" God did anything is delusional, but it's an interesting question for discussion.    Fear of hell isn't the only reason to keep those urges under control.  There's  1.  fear of loathsome communicable diseases.  2.  fear of commitment.  3.  fear of waking up the next morning and seeing who you've done.  4.  fear of divorce attorneys.  5.  fear of jealous husbands and boyfriends.    you get the idea.|`|500b0fe5bfd90198931c2235e47b33efaa	God allowed sin to be possible in order to demonstrate His love to all creatures in time and eternity.    Originally, humans were able to control their appetites. See http://jayzuv.com/nee.html/    Now we are in the same dilemma Paul was in when he wrote Romans 7. I won't bother cutting and pasting, since you probably wouldn't read it anyway.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	The problem here is that you have been taught to believe that certain natural biological processes are sins.    I don't think you are going to be able to make sense of this until you drop that assumption.    Until then you are just going to have to either live with the guilt of doing it, or the anguish of not doing it.    I hope one day you will come to the understanding that natural processes of the body are not sins.
WbJPQM1naa	Wow!  Where do I start to thank HIM... He's provided everything I need for this day... and looking back He has ALWAYS met my need!  I have four children to support, and we have always had a roof over our heads and enough to eat.  We have been cared for by strangers and friends.  I am a single parent, and I could be bitter that my ex husband doesn't provide for us, but that would require too energy!    I have so much to be thankful for!   And even when I don't have things that seem right in my life, I'm still gonna thank HIM.   Read in ACTS where Paul and Silas were in jail and had been beaten.  They decided, in spite of their circumstances, to praise HIM.   And God brought the walls of the jail down!   Praising HIM gives YOU the strength you need to fight every daily battle.  It also sends a strong message to the lord of the earth:  YOU do have the victory over darkness, illness, depression and strife!       Yehua said we would not have an easy life as believers.  We would have persecution and difficulty.  But, in spite of that, we make a conscious decision to give HIM thanks and praise every day for everything, even the bad stuff.  When we do this, we have HIS JOY and HIS love in abundance;  WE have the life HE promised us!    "Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest!"    I also like this word:    "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.   8 We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;   9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed   10 always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.   11 For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.   12 So then death is working in us, but life in you."    This is the WORD I remember when I am faced with trials... and STILL I give HIM the THANKS and GLORY HE so richly deserves!    I hope you can learn to see HIS love and faithfulness through every trial.  Take care,  R|`|AA11812015	I don't thank a God for the fortunate life I live.

1pTUU82jaa	Since we are dealing with totem poles  Id say start with the raven since lotsa inuit tribes there considerr it sacred... then a memebr face and a representitive like a animal clan... possibly Grizzly,Kodiak,or even get or google an Unit story and see their stories told on the pole... get it?  Raven,clan feature/slike the bears an other like a fox ,wolf,even Mouse... ,water spirits like either a whale or Orka,,ya have to be distinct..on what water people you piut on the pole... good luck.... Hope this helps...    top of the pole to bottom.  raven  clan totem like the bear,  water spirits.. but Im so not an expert...But it feels this way to me..|`|alveN3vSaa	I've given thought to a totem pole myself. I always thought that you put your totem animals on there. For me I thought the Red-tailed Hawk be on top, then wolf, then eagle and last horse. I could be wrong. I am willing to hear from others more on the totem pole. I love to learn as I learn more and more about my heritage so I can be deeply rooted in it.|`|GZhNfGLsaa	So why are you posting this at the last minute. Research what tribes have totem poles then ask them. Seriously are you ain't gonna be getting anywhere with this.|`|ppR5kH4Yaa	Hmmm.  I don't get all of the school assignments that ask students to mock Native culture.  I know that it isn't intended to mock Native culture but it does.      PEOPLE, totem poles, stories, names, etc. are not made up just because.  Obviously a person who requests these things be done has no clue about the culture and their attempts to honor or teach about the culture only bastardize it.  It is truly disrespectful.    If you aren't of a people who have totem poles as part of their culture, you shouldn't be having anything to do with 'making up' a totem pole.|`|Oct9Pv9Jaa	top to bottom

However, since I don't advocate violence, the best thing you can do in this circumstance is steer clear of this former friend for the rest of your life.  You can't be truly sorry for what you did, or you would never have done it in the first place.  That means you are only sorry that your immoral behavior was discovered.  If I were in her shoes, then I would certainly refuse to continue being your friend.      The other thing you can do is have the common decency to be ashamed of your behavior, and never ever repeat this massive mistake again.  Steer clear of all married men in the future.  Don't even look at men with girlfriends.  The best way to show you are actually sorry is to reform your behavior for life.  In this circumstance gift giving and contrite words are all empty and meaningless gestures.      I hope this helps.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	Buy a cheap suitcase and run like hell!

Takes a life time to build and one moment to shatter - trust, the best gift you can give her is to let her know you are leaving her life, there is no card for I'm sorry I ruined your marriage, and that is what you have done.

xzkp7Pklaa	Well, we do know that the Earth WILL be inhabited and "subdued" by righteous mankind.  So I would imagine that implicating having children to a certain degree.  But I think the last thing to worry about is space and room, again this is Jehovah God the Grand Creator we are talking about.  Just imagine all of the planets and how big some of them are....now just imagine how much space we would have if Jehovah just made Jupiter alone inhabitable for humans.  Now just imagine all of the stars, and planets and celestial bodies outside of our IMENSE galaxy!  If Jehovah wills ALL of them could support human life, just as he made the once uninhabitable Earth into a beautiful, diverse, perfect habitat for humankind.  Also even if we are only to be here on earth, with perfect minds and under perfect direction we could STILL have practically endless space, especially when you consider that water makes up about 70% of Earths mass anyway.  Who knows what kind of ingenious and resourceful engineering and construction we could achieve with perfect minds!!  The tallest building in the world (I forget the name) is in Dubai and its almost a half a mile long!! (give or take) And it was made by imperfect human beings.  Now just imagine what we could build with PERFECT minds!  We could have underwater constructions that big and bigger that span the entire globe!  The builders of the Tower of Babel proves that we are capable of amazing things, so again from both perspective's - that of space travel and dwelling, to terrestial living, its not a matter of IF we can...only what Jehovah wills.....and that will be beautiful, great, amazing and satisfying no matter where it is!    Great question......now, if we can only make it there  By the way all the exclamation points are out of sheer excitement...not sarcastic indignation. lol|`|3Phz1nHeaa	That is a question that I have asked many times myself.  I have heard many differnt takes on it that yes we will or no we will not.  However we have no idea what will all be taking place in the new system.  I had a very hard time conceving and finally had my precious baby boy in August.  This had been a struggle for me for a very long time.  Since I thought it was not possible for me to have children because of inhernt imperfection.  The comfort that I was able to take form the scriptures is found in the book of Psmals and I believe chapter 145 verse 15 or 16 it reads something like this .....  He is opening his hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing.  We just need to put our trust in Jehovah.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	Isaiah 65:20 and 23 - "will not bring to BIRTH for disturbance".    So since it mentiones births for the new heavens and new earth in that chapter, it is reasonable that there will be children born in the new system, paradise on earth.|`|4hsl2toNaa	We must put our full trust in Jehovah to do what is best.  He has never failed, nor will he.|`|AA10671142	we will have to wait and see, what Jehovah has planned for us.|`|AA11340918	Jehovah wants the earth to be filled so I guess if it still has space when paradise is set up, we should be able to.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	Indications are that even including the ones resurrected...and the ones alive today....the earth will still not be full. Remember many of the ones resurrected will not live forever...they will protest as they have before...and there will also be the time after the 1000 year reign that many will follow Satan. So we are not sure if those who survive the great tribulation will have offspring if they were already past the childbearing stage.    Bottom Line.....we shouldn't speculate ...we have never seen the wonderous things Jehovah will have in store for us.|`|47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	I don't have my library handy, but there are some prophecies that talk about the 'offspring' of those returning to Israel in 537 BCE.    So those who survive Armageddon, may be allowed to have children in the "new system"    Especially if they kept their Life simple in this system, to extend themselves for the Kingdom.    But the original command to Adam was to "fill the earth".    What happens when this is reached?  Only Jehovah knows.    .|`|nh9kcxsDaa	Adam & Eve were told to "fill the earth" not overpopulate it. Whether people wil just stop having kids or whether they populate other planets remains to be seen.    Remember after Jehovah resolves the dispute over his sovereignty there will be an end to his "day" of rest.  What will he do on the 8th day?!|`|86218b3eee8a27ac46cd66ace3e43a3daa	If you remember in Genesis that Jehovah said to Adam to fill the earth, not over fill or out of control, for the earth has amazing potential to house billions.  Please note this breakdown, concerning those resurrected and if there would be enough land area to house:    *** it-2 p. 792 Resurrection ***    Resurrection During 1,000 Years. A very liberal estimate of the number of persons that have ever lived on earth is 20 billion (20,000,000,000). Many students of the subject calculate that not nearly so many have lived. Not all of these, as it has been shown in the foregoing discussion, will receive a resurrection, but even assuming that they did, there would be no problem as to living space and food for them. The land surface of the earth at present is about 148,000,000 sq km (57,000,000 sq mi), or about 14,800,000,000 ha (36,500,000,000 acres). Even allowing half of that to be set aside for other uses, there would be more than a third of a hectare (almost 1 acre) for each person. As to earths potential food production, a third of a hectare will actually provide much more than enough food for one person, especially when, as God has demonstrated in the case of the nation of Israel, there is abundance of food as a result of Gods blessing.1Ki 4:20; Eze 34:27.    On the question of the earths food-producing power, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization maintains that, with only moderate improvements in agricultural methods, in even the developing areas the earth could easily feed up to nine times the population that scientists have estimated for the year 2000.Land, Food and People, Rome, 1984, pp. 16,?17.|`|wWE6u4peaa	well i suppose that rests in jehovah's hands. remember new scrolls will be opened too, so who knows most of the earth is water maybe he will make it more land. or maybe he will expand the earth, we dont know. so ultimatly we really have to believe that he will fulfill our every desire.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	Very good question, i thought about this in the past.    when i was younger i decided there should be a new earth next to ours with a giant ladder connecting the 2 XD|`|HziXc5Ovaa	Everyone has really given the right and helpful information. It will take a long time to fill the earth anyway. As you'd mentioned, there are places due to imperfect conditions that are not liveable at the moment...but when paradise is restored, there will be more than enough space for each individual.    That said, there will still be procreating in the earth. But naturally, common sense will dictate that once the earth is filled, then perhaps procreating may end in due time. Yet again, we need to be careful about speculation. Jehovah said there will be 'new scrolls' that will be opened in the new system. So we will be learning new things at the time as well.     But always remember, Jehovah never fails his people, as David next made clear by saying: To you the eyes of all look hopefully, and you are giving them their food in its season. You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing. (Psalm 145:15,?16).    So we need not worry about anything. Whatever Jehovah desires for us and plans for us will always be to our benefit.|`|JbCAxMVjaa	It's one of the many things that we will just have to wait and see. Eventually, the earth would get filled up, so someway or another, we will have to either stop procreating, or start colonizing other planets. (The other planets thing is a bit far-fetched-we know that the earth is our inheritance, but the Bible says nothing about us having rights to other planets. But what with living forever and all, it is certainly possible.)    Whatever Jehovah decides to do, though, remember- in the New System, He will 'open His hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing'. So Jehovah's arrangement on this matter will be the right decision, and no one will be unhappy about it.     Personally, I like the idea of colonizing, or at least exploring, other planets. With our perfect minds and limitless time, we will be able to take technology to new heights, far above what would be possible in this imperfect system. We'll just have to wait and see....|`|J5eTFqO9aa	It has been estimated that more people were on this planet at the time of the great flood than there is at this present moment.

They're on the right track, as far as I'm concerned. They smell a religious fraud when they see one. They can also smell Christian trolls masquerading as intelligent humans.|`|JCnSm91uaa	In my particular case... for most of my life I was a born again Bible trained Baptist minister that dropped out of Christianity and religion in general when I realized that my intelligence was insulted by some crappy Bible writers!    The old Jewish Bible writers had no sense of proportion, or any scientific knowledge, or any sense of time and space!!!  They had no idea at all of how big is our universe!  They came up with a primitive creation story to explain how we were put together that is not much different from the stories told in the Middle East at that time. They created a God to go along with their story.  The God that they created is so narcissistically oriented that he begins to kill everybody if he doesnt get worshiped the right way without rest day and night! This God turned out to be quite a sadistic psychopath, too in desperate need of a shrink!    Revelation 4:8-9 (KJV) and they REST NOT DAY AND NIGHT, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come* (*thats all that the Christians will do for ever and ever and ever when they get to Heaven).  And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne    To add insult to injury all Christians want to be with Jesus in Heaven for ever and ever, but they dont stop to think what Jesus is saying that in Heaven he will be surrounded FOR ALL ETERNITY by 144,000 VIRGIN JEWISH GUYS who NEVER defiled themselves with WOMEN! Not bad! Gay oriented Bible writers and Preachers like Ted Haggard can only dream of a Heaven like that! BTW The promise for a number of men to be forever with Jesus were made to his Holy Jewish Apostles who forsook all family ties to follow Jesus as demonstrated by the institution of the Holy Communion* (*in lieu of the Jewish Passover that MUST BE celebrated in a family setting at home! Luke 14:26, Mark 10:28-30. Later on after Jesus death Saint Peter went back to his wife).     Revelation 14:3-4 (NIV) And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. NO ONE* (*in Heaven) COULD LEARN THE SONG except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. These* (*144,000 Jewish Virgin guys  Google Wikipedia, castrati) are those who DID NOT DEFILE THEMSELVES WITH WOMEN* (*Are they all gay sopranos trained by the Church over the centuries? They never dated or touched a girl no matter how virgin she claimed to be, but it doesnt say anything that they were not fooling around with GUYS! Nuns need not to apply! No virgin girl is ever seen near Jesus anywhere or anytime in any of the Bible stories!) for they kept themselves pure. THEY FOLLOW THE LAMB WHEREVER HE GOES* (*any sexually liberated Christian guy wishing to come near Jesus aka The Lamb in Heaven will have to elbow himself in through these 144,000 virgin Jews while Christian ladies need to be very careful not to touch any of them!). They were purchased from among MEN* (*not among women!) and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb* (*Can you sense any sexual innuendo here?)    The most prominent Bible scholars (theologians) are telling us that the Bible cant be taken literally (short of seriously). Everything in the Bible is to be interpreted according to the dogmas of each particular Christian brand of faith.  So at the end let the best faith win!     Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 (NIV) For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward* (*The grave is the final reward!), and even the memory of them is forgotten* (*Not true in all cases, but what the heck this is Gods word!). [10]   WHATEVER your hand finds to do, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT* (*without any restriction just be wise!), for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.    Ecclesiastes 3:19 (NIV) Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is vanity.    The writers of the Book of Job admitted the same destiny for humankind     Job 7:9 (NIV) As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	Well, you're an obvious anti-atheist troll on R&S, so I'll take that as evidence that atheism is not a religion.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	Atheism fulfills none of the criteria of what make something a religion.

Secular humanism is not the same thing as atheism.  Secular humanism has philosophical precepts, but these are not the philosophical precepts of atheism (which is simply a non-belief in gods).    If you do not believe (or have an ignorant misunderstanding of) a particular scientific result, that does not necessarily mean that those who do believe it are being "dogmatic".|`|89MKzLl3aa	No, it just tells me that there are a lot of people who just have a "thing" about Christians.|`|AA11297267	No...but it's evidence that there are all kinds of wacky people in the world.  Precisely *because* atheism isn't any kind of organized religion or system, all kinds of people treat it any way they want to.      You've mis-stated the court's finding in the case you cited.  The court simply affirmed that atheism merited the same protections regarding lack of government interference and freedom of expression as religion does -- not that atheism is indeed a religion.  To quote from the decison:    "the Court understands the reference to religion to include what it often calls "nonreligion." In McCreary County, it described the touchstone of Establishment Clause analysis as "the principle that the First Amendment mandates government neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.""    Atheism was explicity stated by the court to be nonreligion, but they affirmed that nonreligion merited the same constitutional protection as religion.    And so falls your house of cards.    Peace.|`|47sALOGfaa	There is no atheist cult guide book, nor are there weekly indoctrination ceremonies.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

To answer, there is a difference in being God and being a god.    When God says that there exist no other Gods besides Him, He's speaking of the fact that there is no other supreme being, no one else with the right to rule over all mankind.  This is why "almighty" is used in reference to God (by contrast, Jesus is only ever called "mighty", thus indicating a limit to his power - Phil. 2:6).    However, the term 'god' is also used to indicate a position of authority.  It is not the same as calling such ones actual gods in opposition to God, but shows that they have some measure of authority granted to them.  In fact, Jesus is not the only one referred to in this way; humans are also. - John 10:34; Ps. 81:6.    Edited for grammar.  Hope this helps.    Edit 2: I don't seem to be able to post a second reply here, so I'll try editing this:    I'm seeing a lot of unfavorable comments on the translation you've asked about (NWT). I don't agree with the comments made. Please find below a copy-pasted answer to a question on this forum from one year ago relating to accurate Bible translations. It's a bit lengthy, but highly informative. You may also wish to visit the link a read the original poster's response:    *BENJAMIN KEDAR: (Benjamin Kedar is a professor at Hebrew University in Israel). In my linguistic research in connection with the Hebrew Bible and translations, I often refer to the English edition of what is known as the New World Translation. In so doing, I find my feeling repeatedly confirmed that this work reflects an honest endeavor to achieve an understanding of the text that is as accurate as possible. Giving evidence of a broad command of the original language, it renders the original words into a second language understandably without deviating unnecessarily from the specific structure of the Hebrew... Every statement of language allows for a certain latitude in interpreting or translation. So the linguistic solution in any given case may be open to debate. But I have never discovered in the New World Translation any biased intent to read something into the text that it does not contain.      *STEVEN T. BYINGTON: (Steven T. Byington translated the version known as "The Bible in Living English"). If you are digging for excellent or suggestive renderings this is among the richer mines. (Christian Century, "Review of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, November 1, 1950 page 1296)     *JASON BEDUHN: (Associate Professor of Religious Studies, and Chair Department of Humanities, Arts, and Religion Northern Arizona University). I have just recently completed teaching a course for the Religious Studies Department of Indiana University, Bloomington, ...This is primarily a course in the Gospels. Your help came in the form of copies of the Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures which my students used as one of the textbooks for the class. These small volumes were invaluable to the course and very popular with my students...Simply put, it is the best interlinear New Testament available. I am a trained scholar of the Bible, familiar with the texts and tools in use in modern biblical studies, and by the way, not a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses. But I know a quality publication when I see one, and your 'New World Bible Translation Committee' has done its job well. Your interlinear English rendering is accurate and consistent to an extreme that forces the reader to come to terms with the linguistic, cultural, and conceptual gaps between the Greek-speaking world and our own. Your 'New World Translation' is a high quality, literal translation that avoids traditional glosses in its faithfulness to the Greek. It is, in many ways, superior to the most successful translations in use today.     *The Harper Collins Bible Dictionary calls it [New World Translation] one of the "major translations of the Bible into English," along with the Knox translation, the Jerusalem Bible, New American Bible and the New English Bible. p. 292     *EDGAR FOSTER: (Classics Major, Lenoir-Rhyne College) Before I formally began to study Greek, I simply compared the NWT with lexicons, commentaries, and other translations to try and determine it's accuracy. It passed the litmus test then and it also passes the test now for me...The NWT is a fine translation. In my mind, it is the translation _par excellence_. But I feel just as confortable with an RSV or an NASB. Mostly I prefer my UBS Greek text.      *THOMAS N. WINTER: (Thomas N. Winter taught Greek at the University of Nebraska). I think it is a legitimate and highly useful aid toward the mastery of koine (and classical) Greek. After examining a copy, I equipped several interested second-year Greek students with it as an auxiliary test. After learning the proper pronunciations, a motivated student could probably learn koine from this source alone. ...the translation by the anonymous committee is thoroughly up to date and consistently accurate. ...In sum, when a witness comes to the door, the classicist, Greek student, or Bible student alike would do well to place an order.

Elohim is plural of Elh.  So? Jesus Is Elh. The Father is Elh. And the Holy Spirit is Elh.  God (Elohim) the Father, Word & Holy Spirit are our One Creator!    So? The LORD (Yahweh) my God (Elohim) is One (Echad, united) LORD (Yahweh).    In the beginning Jesus was the Word of God. And the Word of God was with God & the Word of God Is God.     Jesus, the Word, is the same God as the Father & Holy Spirit. One Creator God.  When He came to earth & put on humanity, He lowered His position above the Angels & became lower than the Angels. His mission was to be the Lamb of God without blemish & die for our sins. To overcome the curse of sin & death, so we could also defeat the curse of sin & death.  Even though Jesus earthly Ministry wasn't as God; But as the Christ, the Son of the Living God; When He raised from the dead, the Father highly exalted Him (in His Humanity too) with the Name above all names. That at the Name of Jesus every knee shall bow & tongue confess, 'Yeshua Messiah Yahweh' ('Jesus Christ is LORD').  Yeshua means Salvation for He shall save His people. And there is no Savior besides the LORD.    Jesus is the Christ (Anointed One) who raised the dead, healed the sick, delivered people from satans power, forgave sins, etc... by the Power of the Holy Spirit (who Is God).    Jesus Christ is Jehovah (LORD). With the Father & the Holy Spirit. This is the One God (Elohim) of the Trinity.|`|sGojEWOxaa	Yes I can.  I am guessing that you are referring to John 1:1 ?  It doesn't say that Jesus is "a" god, it says that He IS God.    John 1   1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.      2The same was in the beginning with God.      3All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.     It is pretty simple, but it is a revelation.  Jesus is God, the same God of the old testament robed Himself in flesh and came and dwelt among us.  John 1:13-15 (King James Version)     13Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.      14And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.      15John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.    There is only ONE God, and His name is Jesus.  All the other names for Him in the bible are titles.    I am only one person, but I have many titles, my name is Rebecca,  but my titles are Mother, Sister, Wife, friend, employee etc...  Jesus is God - because god is not a name it is a title.  The "name" Jehovah means (when intrpreted) God with us or "I am".  He had not yet revealed His name in the old testament, which is why He called Himself "I am that I am", "the first and the last".  Here is a really good website that will give you all the information you care to explore on the subject.  www.apostolicchurches.com/godhead.html  Pray that God will reveal Himself to you, and He will.  Every word in the bible is true, so when He says "Hear O Israel the Lord our God is one, it is still true today."    I really hope this helps.|`|2XIFZs8haa	Matt.16:15-17, Read the gospels all over again and you will begin to see why the Jews crucifyed Him.

V.6 "Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I [am] the first, and I [am] the last; and beside me [there is] no God."    V.9&10 "They that make a graven image [are] all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they [are] their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image [that] is profitable for nothing?"    If V.6 ment to be only one 'elohiym then there would be no trinity. God would be made up of hundreds of trillions of 'elohiym who worship 'elohiym. - Psalms 8:5    "For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels*, and hast crowned him with glory and honour."    "m@`at chacer 'elohiym* `atar kabowd hadar" - Psalms 8:5    'elohiym = God(s)

There are all sorts of experiments reputed to have demonstrated continuing consciousness for minutes after decapitation. It's also clear that the machine is not always effective ... at the time of the French Revolution the timbers became so soaked with blood (the earlier answer was right about a lot of spurting) that they swelled up and stopped the blade dropping cleanly. The blade had to be hammered down through the neck by the executioner. The issue of the walk to the machine is relevant too, as often that was literally a blood-soaked area, and many victims simply failed to stay on their feet. The reality, whatever you make of the experiments on consciousness, was less than ideal, and several recent mess-ups of lethal injection show that there too, you have to deal with reality, not theory. A British ex-politician, Michael Portillo, recently researched alternative methods and discovered that inhaling a commonly available gas is fast, painless and nearly foolproof. People apparently, as they approach death, go into a state of euphoria. When he proposed the method to advocates of the death penalty he was treated with contempt because the method wasn't painful enough. They wanted maximum terror and pain, a slow, agonising death. Sadly, this appears to be the case in many countries, that the motivation behind the death penalty, or behind many specific methods, is more to do with sexual gratification for witnesses or bystanders than it is with doing justice or dealing appropriately with a guilty human being.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Define painless.

Accounts from the French Revolution often speak of severed heads rolling their eyes and trying to speak in the first few seconds after decapitation so that's not instantaneous, though it's probably fairly quick.

In the millenium millions and millions of others will be resurrected.     Everyone will slowly become perfected so that by the end of the 1000 years all on earth will be perfect just like Adam and Eve were.     So at this point none of the resurrected had been tested yet because they were dead.  Also any babies that were born and raised to adulthood had not been tested yet.  The only ones that were tested were the ones that survived Armageddon but they are few compared to the resurrected.    At the end of the thousand years, Satan who has been in a state of inactivity (Abyss) will be let out.    Now it will be " the garden of eden" all over again.  All on earth will be perfect and know the requirements of God ( just like Adam and Eve).      No one on earth or in the heavens can say that God did not deal fairly.  Any mislead at this point or any who rebell will be destroyed along with Satan and his demons.      Never again will there be a question on who has the right to rule the universe.      All who are remaining on the earth will enjoy peace, and enjoyment for ever and ever as it was meant to be.|`|7NEGq9iZaa	Abyss    The abode of the dead and the place where evil spirits are imprisoned (Rev. 9:1-11).

AA12196812	I think people who are sayig any gene can be dominant are missing the point! Some genes indeed are more dominant than others, and yes, dar skin, dark eyes etc is dominant, so you'd expect a interracial child to look darker, etc. (Interestingly, in cats it's not the dark color that's dominant, it's stripes).    In the case with 3/4 white, there is a probability that the genes that got passed down are mostly from the white side.    I looked up Jennifer Beals. I would not know from that picture that she is not white. I think part of that is makeup and hair. Part is that we really are not that good in recognizing the ethnicity. Also, if she had blue eyes that'd be much more conclusive. But she does not.    I also dare venture this guess: somewhere in some of these people's blood there were recessive genes from some plantator a hundred years ago, which just happened to be passed along...    So it's a combination of things.|`|x3EPqezJaa	It's not true that the father's gene or the "black" gene is more dominant--that's just an old wives tale. Plus, in the United States, a large percentage of blacks have some white ancestry. There are only a few genes that determine skin color, and if someone from a black parent and a white parent gets a gene from their black parent that controls skin color and that can be traced back to having come from some white ancestor 10 generations ago, then that means that that person might end up with both of their skin-color-coding genes being traceable back to white ancestors. Thus, their skin ends up being light-colored. The *expression* of the genes is blended for skin color (so one gene for light skin and one gene for dark skin results in a skin tone that is intermediate between the two), but the original genes maintain their original coding, so no matter how many generations go by, a gene that codes for light pigmentation will remain the same. For every example you can give of a biracial who "looks white," I can give an example of a biracial who doesn't: Barack Obama, Lenny Kravitz, Halle Berry, Lisa Bonet, Rebecca Walker, etc.|`|jG7ejIZvaa	Anything verify "larger" always dominant. just take a look at the asian biracial caucasian. they tend to look caucasian than asian because caucasian characteristics are dominant.

XFlb3zlSaa	yes masterbation is sin for both women and males. screw all those other answers. i'll give you a level headed one and a reason. a sin is usually wrong because it leads you away from god and more towards negative temptations in the world. it's wrong because its shows you have a lust. it's not like sex is evil period. but it's only for a union for a male and a female in a marrital status. what are you thinkin about when masterbating? who are you thinking about when masterbating. now there's a big question as for if you can masturbate to your wife if you're married. i'm not gonna mke up stuff from the bible or say stuff that i'm not sure about. but in my opinion why masterbate to your wife in the first place? even if at times she doesn't feel like it just chill. people have strong minds and tend to let them drift. so if you choose to masterbate to your wife becareful no one else comes into your mind. also becareful that your love of sex doesn't exceed the love of your wife. so what do you think? that's a pretty reasonable answer right?|`|AA10873763	So us girls get a free pass?

All of the medical evidence (and yes, there have been a lot of studies regarding masturbation) shows that it's not harmful in any way, it doesn't affect any ability to "be able to tomorrow," and that it's completely normal among primates including us.  An *addiction* to masturbation is a possible sign of some kinds of mental disorders, but unless you do it so often that you physically damage yourself, it's not physically harmful in any way.    So whack away.    Peace.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	If it is a sin then not very many males are going to make it, actually it keep you health and more able to reproduce, men who masturbate have less incidence of prostate cancer and less psychological problems and a healthier marriage.  There is no evidence that it harms you  in any way.   The spiritual struggle that the churches puts on young males is damaging, they are asked to go against the very nature that God gave them ,they are told they are not worthy if they give in to natural urges. This conflict leads to alcoholism and drug use and poor marriages.even suicide. There is nothing wrong with celebrating the joy and pleasure you where born to and not having any guilt the church is wrong to harm youth this way. I just read a article written by a doctor who  is a LDS member and these are his words, paraphrased. He is a person who has extensive biblical knowledge and medical knowledge.  The very people who are telling you these lies is practicing behind closed doors the thing he preaches against.So it is not a sin but a celebration of Gods gifts to you and a natural  urge to gratify a natural urge is to understand God gave it to you He expects you to use it. By doing this you will not harm your future ability to reproduce in fact you will be keeping your reproductive system healthy. God never intended to cause the harm that men inflict with the unhealthy  conflict they make.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	I've never thought of masturbation as a "waste".

The Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts... they wouldn't put any restrictions on masturbation!    Hardly any Christian knows the story of Leah Leah is an ancestor of Jesus. She is also one of the alleged Matriarchs of the Israelites. Jacob* (*Israel) was a polygamist. Jesus comes from a line of polygamist forbears. Leah paid in DRUGS to her own sister Rachel to buy some SEXUAL FAVOR from her negligent husband Jacob. Jacob and Leah became ancestors of Jesus in the first ever recorded DRUGS FOR SEX DEAL in the Bible!!! All under Gods approval, supervision, inspiration and leading of God the Holy Ghost! The real funny bottom line is that Jacob was married to BOTH SISTERS and they seemed to buy a night in bed with him paying each other in drugs AND DOING DRUGS ALL IN JACOBS FAMILY, INCLUDING THEIR CHILDREN!!! I am not saying that the Jacobs family was a bunch of junkies, OK? So dont report me please!!! They were all HOLY PEOPLE OF GOD!!! The dishonest Bible schooled preachers that you pay your tithes to wont tell you all the Bible facts! They dont want to compromise their source of income!    Marrying girls of the same family is common place in Bible stories! King David is also an ancestor of God the Son Jesus Christ. Among his many wives he was married to Michal and God personally added her mom to his collection of wives! In this particular case King David had no choice at all! Christians dont teach all these plain Bible facts to kids in Sunday School today otherwise we would be allowed all kinds of agreeable options in our families, including but not limited to same sex marriages! Can you imagine a Holy threesome of King David, Michal and her mother in bed at the same time to keep it all in the family? In the New Testament SPIRIT FILLED Church at Corinth, Greece a young man was having sex with his own mother and THE WHOLE CHURCH WAS PROUD OF IT! (1 Cor 5:1-2) Saint Paul didnt condemn the mother for having sex with her son at all. Saint Paul reprimanded ONLY the son who was probably still a teenager!!! How kinky can you possibly get in the Bible stories, especially in the New Testament where it really counts for todays Christians? Amazingly, we have this SEX for DRUGS deal in the Bible that NO PRUDE PREACHER WANTS TO TALK ABOUT!!! (But it is only today if Christianity is to survive for a while longer, a lot of preachers will soon be making a living out of regulating same sex marriages, abortions, and so on)     Genesis 30:15-16 (NIV) But she said to her, Wasn't it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son's mandrakes too? Very well, Rachel said, he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes.* (*Check, mandrake in Wikipedia! It is a hallucinogenic drug plant. Leahs son was obviously a very knowledgeable teenager!) So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. You must sleep with me, she said. I have hired you with my son's mandrakes. SO HE SLEPT WITH HER THAT NIGHT.    They probably had plenty of mandrakes to go around that night, too! Surely Rachel didnt keep all the mandrakes for herself. This same Rachel turned out to be quite a horny dominatrix, too! Not even Hustler magazine would publish such Bible stories promoting the use of drugs for sex! The morality of most of these erotic publications today is commendable, but the Bible ought to be censored!!! When this horny Rachel moved away from her fathers home she stole her parents dildos, too!!! According to the Bible writers, dildos were common place in those days especially in big polygamistic families like King Solomons. He had over 1,000 women to please sexually! Mainly because of his wisdom in handling women sexual needs the Bible writers had God recognize him as the WISEST MAN EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH! (1 Kin 2:12) Not even Jesus Christ was that wise with girls! For over 300 Bible years the Temple of Solomon was a shrine of male and female prostitutes servicing Gods Chosen People! (2 Kin 23:7) God NEVER objected! Only a prude King Josiah did and the Jews ended up in slavery again, anyway!     Genesis 31:19, 34-35 (NIV) When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods* (*dildos in the form of idols). [34-35] Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period."* (*she was probably very juicy already!) So he searched but could not find the household gods.* (*funny, because the law of God about staying away from a woman having a period was not even in effect yet, but the Bible writers made it look like it was!)     Ezekiel 16:17 (NIV) You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols* (*DILDOS) and engaged in prostitution with them.    Prostitution is not a significant sin at all if practiced to favor Gods Holy causes! Rahab was a professional Prostitute who committed high treason against her own country! She lied to her countrys police to protect God's people who came to spend the night with her. She made it into the Faithful Hall of Fame! Hallelujah Praise the LORD!!! She will preserve her title of a RIGHTEOUS PROSTITUTE for eternity!!! Its all in the Bible! Christian American soldiers ought to be encouraged to meet in bed with AlQaida prostitutes to find out where Bin Laden is located!!! Its all in the Bible!    Hebrews 11:31 (KJV) By faith the PROSTITUTE* (*not ex-prostitute, but Prostitute!) Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient (Male and female Prostitutes are known to be very kind to Christian preachers, |`|XX48SZVNaa	well i don t understand how something as good as sex or masturbation could be a sin. Why would god give us so much pleasure if it was a sin?    i think intellectual masturbation is a sin...|`|Cqr1sffjaa	I'm 29 and had testicular cancer, I still create sperm, if I had radiation, and it killed the remaining testical, I would still shoot something.    As for your question, while masturbation, is not a sin on it's own (in good kinky, sex you will masturbate), the sin emerges with what you might be thinking.  If you are married and masturbate, you are probably thinking of other women, which in the heart is unstable and a sin.  Now let's say you think of your wife while grasping yourself, if you are so concerned with what YHWH would think, then don't do it as you should keep your mind on YHWH at all times.    The reason the man died in Scripture is not for masturbating but spilling his seed so that his brother did not have children to carry on his name.        EDIT- there are some who say plenty masturbation does not cause harm, they are wrong.  There is a thing called haematospermia, literally, bloddy sperm and you can rub your urethra raw and bleed. A lot!  It is scary, trust me!  It does not, however leave much lasting harm but for the time it is horrifying.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	What does developing testicular cancer, have to do with healthy men and masturbation?     The life span of a mature sperm is only about 6 days. It doesn't just sit there waiting to be released.     If your testicle is gone, it's not like the penis is a storage facility for your sperm! So, if your not having sex to have a kid on a regular basis, your "wasting" your sperm anyway, whether you want to or not.    And there are some preliminary studies that show having regular orgasms, either through intercourse OR masturbation, can actually reduce your risk of developing testicular cancer.    "a study published April 7 2005, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), indicates that frequent ejaculation might help protect the prostate from cancer.     This study supports a smaller Australian study from 2003 that found that that men in their 20s who ejaculated more then five times a week were one-third less likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer than men who ejaculated four to seven times a month.     Ejaculating regularly might lower risk because cancer-causing substances get flushed out of the body in the seminal fluid, instead of staying in the prostate. "    Holding on to dead tissue, rather than flushing out sounds like sounds rather dumb to me.    Some times it makes me wish I was man! Sounds like ridding your body of unused reproductive material is much more pleasant that having a menstrual cycle that you can't control!

AQPmrsVSaa	A lot of them are scared that not rejecting it would make them seem gay, and they're terrified of being mistaken for being gay. To a lot of guys, being gay means you're less masculine, so being mistaken for being gay means people think you aren't manly enough. With girls, there isn't as much of a stigma, so they tend to not be as worried about being mistaken for being gay or bi.    Admittedly, I'll have to give them this: a penis in the pooper does indeed sound like an unpleasant feeling. So it could be thoughts of things like "does that even fit, it looks painful" or "wait, gross, that's where poop comes from" leading to the knee-jerk reaction.    And for all of the reasons above, I'd like to mention that most straight guys have zero problem with gay sex if it's between two or more women. If you're a straight guy watching two girls getting it on, your sexuality doesn't come into question. And since the method of sex is different, and because guys can't relate to the feelings in a female's body as easily, there's no knee-jerk reaction as there is with males.|`|HAHDipTAaa	I blame their parents for not explaining to them when they were kids that there are all forms of relationship - not just M/F. After all if they grew up with a proper view of society they would not even be interested in puking over someone Else's relationship|`|Oll0CHkbaa	"I laugh and I think to myself, are they just THAT insecure in themselves and sexuality that they'll go to any great lengths to mask it?" Indeed. Your laughter is well-based.    In regards to Happy-2, some of us straight guys have our profiles trolling for questions in this section where the GLBT community might want our input. So, this section is quite the right place for the question, as you'll only get the open-minded guys like me not the bigots(usually).|`|4HClQObFaa	They react publicly against it because they are so easily tempted.    When someone gets an erection in the showers they all get it - as I say they are easily aroused. And they are scared to death that if they tried it they might like it and they are stupid because they ought to know that one's sexuality isn't a choice.    But there are lots of circumstances that show what I say to be true.    Join the navy and see how young men behave when they are weeks or even months away from women. I was surprised how many were willing to have sex with me!    And some of them were willing after a day!    It was just an excuse, I think.|`|hy5la80Baa	it is disturbing so in Sports what is the smack to the ***|`|hp5x7WC9aa	They act disgusted because deep down they're scared cause they want to try it.|`|thVN9X2Baa	They are just afraid of how they really feel.

I recommend you take this question over to Family & Relationships --> Singles & Dating and get some real answers.|`|WDbE5gffaa	They do it because they don't want people to think they are gay. Its society that teaches them its so disgusting, not their personal thoughts.
S8pIwxpwaa	Your friends should be at least willing to have coffee with him. Midway through the coffee date, coach them to discuss among themselves how comfy they are with him... if they think he's okay, have them ask him to stay for dinner. If not, end the coffee date and call it good.    Your friends get top priority, but hopefully they'll be good enough & open minded enough to share you with a long lost friend for coffee & a meal. They may even have a great time with a new friend.    Best of luck!

I just can't find any reason to hate anything or anyone unless that certain thing or individual makes a reason for me to hate them. Opinions of others or the environment I live in just doesn't influence me to hate or like anything I've never met. So I guess that means I'm not easily influenced by something like that.    Did the devil cause trouble to me? Did it do anything to me or for me? Did God? I have no idea and I have no way of knowing it so I basically don't care and rather than hate them and waste my energy for nothing, I'll just come up with a solution to any of my troubles in life.

AA10873763	Take a gun safety course with your husband.  I'm not a fan, either, but if he wants one in the house you need to know how to use it, care for it, and keep it secure.

Religion easily has the best bullshit story of all time. Think about it. Religion has convinced people that theres an invisible manliving in the sky. Who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he doesnt want you to do. And if you do any of these things, he will send you to a special place, of burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever, and suffer, and burn, and scream, until the end of time. But he loves you. He loves you. He loves you and he needs money.    2. Atheism: A non-prophet organization.    3. Im completely in favor of the separation of Church and State. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death.    Friedrich Nietzsche  4. Which is it, is man one of Gods blunders or is God one of mans?    5. Faith means not wanting to know what is true.    6. Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.    Albert Einstein  7. What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility. This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism.    8. It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously. I also cannot imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere.  Science has been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.Albert Einstein, Religion and Science, New York Times Magazine, 9 November 1930    9. If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.        Gandhi Quotes  10. The most henious and the must cruel crimes of which history has record have been committed under the cover of religion or equally noble motives.Mohandas K Gandhi, Young India, July 7, 1950, quoted from Laird Wilcox, ed., The Degeneration of Belief    11. I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.    Mark Twain  12. It aint those parts of the Bible that I cant understand that bother me, it is the parts that I do understand.    13. A man is accepted into a church for what he believes and he is turned out for what he knows.  14. What God lacks is convictions  stability of character. He ought to be a Presbyterian or a Catholic or something  not try to be everything.    15. Under certain circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer.Mark Twain, quoted from Curmudgeon-Online    16. In God We Trust. I dont believe it would sound any better if it were true.    Thomas Jefferson  17. Shake off all fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God, because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear.    18. We are afraid of the known and afraid of the unknown. That is our daily life and in that there is no hope, and therefore every form of philosophy, every form of theological concept, is merely an escape from the actual reality of what is. All outward forms of change brought about by wars, revolutions, reformations, laws and ideologies have failed completely to change the basic nature of man and therefore of society.    Benjamin Franklin  19. The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason: The Morning Daylight appears plainer when you put out your Candle. Benjamin Franklin, the incompatibility of faith and reason, Poor Richards Almanack (1758)    20. Lighthouses are more helpful then churches.    Voltaire  21. If God has made us in his image, we have returned him the favor.Voltaire    22. Those who believe absurdities will commit atrocities.    Stephen Hawking  23. Black holes would seem to suggest that God not only plays dice, but also sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen.Stephen Hawking, NATURE, 1975    24. We could call order by the name of God, but it would be an impersonal God. Theres not much personal about the laws of physics.    Jiddu Krishnamurti  25. Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay. Jiddu    Krishnamurti  26. The constant assertion of belief is an indication of fear. Jiddu Krishnamurti  Christopher Hitchens  27. What can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof. Christopher Hitchens    28. Christopher Hitchens On Jerry Falwell: If you gave Falwell an enema, he could be buried in a matchbox.    Sigmund Freud      29. Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength from the fact that it falls in with our instinctual desires. Sigmund Freud  Karl Marx  30. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.    George Bernard Shaw  31. The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. George Bernard Shaw    32.

AA12351039	My girlfriend did the following on our anniversary. My apartment has four rooms, in each room, there was a specific part of our relationship. ex: The For-room was made (with decoration) like a swimming pool, cause that's where weve met. Then I had to follow to to next room (each room had its specific number). In my working room,the PC was playing Happy Feet, cause that's what we were watching on our first date. Then number three was the living room,... In every room there was a note explaining what it is supposed to mean, using quotes,... .By the time I got to the end I was crying like a baby, so it definitely was the best gift ever.  So try to think up all the memorable situations in your relationship, make lots of decorations.  Believe me it works.   Good luck!

"My child," He said in somber tones,  "For miles I carried you along.  I challenged you to walk in faith,  But you refused and made me wait."    "You disobeyed, you would not grow,  The walk of faith, you would not know,  So I got tired, I got fed up,  And there I dropped you on your butt."

If she were qualified I would say I would love to have her in bed with a boyfriend or two. I like the characters in Two For One by Sean David Wright. Danielle Edwards lives with the man of her dreams author Max Bland who wrote a best-selling novel about a lesbian pope. Danielle  is bisexual (a fact Max knows nothing about) and  her love is not strong enough to keep her from wanting intimacy with women. She meets Katie a gorgeous lesbian. Max has  come to the conclusion that in order for Danielle to feel complete as a person she needs to enjoy both sides of her sexual nature.

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	You are correct.  The Catholic church may say.. in a matter of speaking that Peter started the Catholic church,  but this is just one way of stating it.  The more ACCURATE statement is that Peter was the head of the Christian religion AND passed on his leadership to a Bishop which then started the position which would become KNOWN AS "the Pope" -- Peter's sucessor was Linus, who appears to even be mentioned in the bible himself...in  2 Timothy 4:21 (though a last name is not mentioned, so we can't be SURE)     So it is true that this verse is considered by Catholics to be where their religion started AND where they get their authority from. But the Catholic church itself, realizes that Peter didn't literally start it.  However, the link between the Successors of Peter and the beginning of the Catholic church is undeniable. His sucessors DID eventualy start the Religion which became known as the Catholic church. We see this FIRST reference to Bishops and Catholic in 110AD in the writings of Ignatius of Antioch.  He refers to the "Katholos" church (greek for Catholic) in a way which makes it VERY clear that it was already in operation. NOT in a general "invisible" church like many Christians claim Christ was referring to..but in a very real, brick and mortar organization.    AND it is TRUE that no other denomination, group, or Church can make such a strong claim to even having a link back to Peter.    Exactly WHEN the Christian faith centered in Rome OFFICIALLY became the Catholic church is unknown because it was a gradual process.  However, there are plenty of documents which show that what very early 1st century christians BELIEVED is the exact same Sacraments and CORE Doctrines that the Catholic church teaches. They have not been changed.  That is partial why the Catholic church points back to Jesus's ordination of Peter..because in a very REAL sense.. this IS the point at which those beliefs and practices were passed on and the keys were transferred so to speak.  AND since Peter's sucessors DID start the Catholic church..then by association and CONNECTION.. the Catholic church started with Peter.    No other Church, organization or denomination can make this type of claim. - So the Catholic faith are singular and special in that regard.     The closest is the Eastern Orthodox's claim to be started by another Apostle,  James I believe (or maybe Paul,  I forget)  However, even THEY admit that Peter was the head of the Early Christian church and had supremacy over the other apostles.     Scripture supports that Peter was usually the FIRST to speak up and that the others seemed to chec-in with him, and not the other way around. When they traveled together... the bible often times says "Peter and the Others"   NOT  Paul, not James, not Timothy.    But to be honest.. Peter didn't LITERALLY start the Catholic church.. BUT his sucessors DID.  Still giving the Catholic church an unbroken LINE back to Peter and STILL giving the Catholic church more AUTHORITY then other churches.  Historically and biblically speaking.     I find it interesting that for the first 1500 years of so of Christianity.. opposing interpretations of these verses did not exist. Even the Eastern Orthodox church believed in Rome as the Center of Christianity and Peter as its original head.      I find it interesting that only AFTER the 1500s do we start to see various alternative interpretations of this verse.  ALMOST as-if those who interpreted it otherwise,  may have had a motive...like justifying their break off from Catholicism.     It is only after the reformation that suddenly people start saying that maybe Peter wasn't that special.. that maybe Paul, James, and Timothy were JUST as important. -- Like they were Co-Leaders.  Some even said,  Paul seemed more authoritative because he wrote more of the books of the bible then Peter did. (that last fact only matters if you base your entire religion on the Bible and nothing more..only THEN do who wrote more, matter)    Suddenly people start saying that because Christians existed in Rome BEFORE Peter centered his church there, that somehow this shows he was not any sort of "leader"    Even some say the the Greek word "Petros" means "little stone" or pebble,  so Jesus didn't mean "Rock" but was showing that Peter was but 1 of many pebbles in the church.  However this latter argument actually shows certain groups quest to justify their break, because Petros is masculine, and Petra (rock) is feminine, so greek translators COULDN'T use the word Petra for Peter, because it was a femine form of the word.  Jesus didn't speak greek, he spoke mostly Aramaic and in Aramaic,  Rock is Cephas.    Through out the Bible when someone's name is changed its a mark of major significance: Abram-Abraham, Jacob-Israel, Saul-Paul, etc.  Consider Peter's original name was Simon.  What is the first thing Jesus does when he meets Simon? He changes his name to Cephas! "So you are Simon son of John? You shall be called Cephas" (which means Peter). (Jn1:42) Now where did this name Cephas come from? Cephas in Jesus' native Aramaic tongue means one and only one thing - Rock! The name completely replaced the original Simon name. Jesus himself picked this name and it is an interesting choice!     HECK,  the Catholic church CREATED the bible that other denominations use to discredit her.  I find that ironic and possibly a little intellectually dishonest.    TO ME.. Since I'm an IT guy and work on computers.. it is a little like using the your DELL INSPIRON User Manual to prove that Dell didn't create your PC or has no knowledge of what's in it.  HELLO!  they created it!...they probably have at least a LITTLE Authority on what goes in it and what is meant by it.     BUT people deny the Catholic Church of even THAT much...even a LITTLE authority to interpret scripture..to say what|`|AA11440601	Yes.    Matthew 16:17-19 states:    Jesus said to him in reply, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father. And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."     John 21:15-17 states:     When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."     He then said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep."     He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." (Jesus) said to him, "Feed my sheep.     The Catholic Church believes the Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock.    The Pope is the senior pastor of 1.1 billion Catholic Christians, the direct successor of Simon Peter.    The Popes main roles include teaching, sanctifying, and governing.

With love in Christ.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Yes, I believe this is what the Catholics teach.  I tend to agree with your first answerer.  Each Disciple was equipped to preach the Gospel of Christ and were ordained by Jesus to go forth in the Great commission.  However the Catholic Church as we know it today is seen later in history.  There were seven Churches that we know of that received letters and instruction from all the Apostles as they made their circuit and moved forward to further the cause of Christ.  While the Catholic Church is one of the oldest churches it does not have exclusive rights to the gospel.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	That's in Matthew 16:18.

The keys don't exist anymore|`|AA12346187	No|`|FBrwlhPtaa	No.     To be a leader of the Catholic Church was a position of wealth and prestige. But for the first 3 centuries, there was No Pope.     Is there any evidence that Peter was ever Pope ? not the slightest. Is there any evidence that any of the disciples of Jesus ever recognized Peter as being the first Pope ? Not in the least.     If the Apostles and Disciples of Jesus would have wanted to, they could have set themselves up as Kings and Popes. Instead they concentrated on the teachings of Jesus Christ as found in the Bible.    One of the better indications of the Lack of Pope & Catholic Church is the record left to us by Polycarp, who was discipled by John. It is interesting that Polycarp is one of the few known disciples of those original disciples of Jesus. Polycarp could have made the case, either that Peter was the first Pope, or that He - Polycarp - should have been included in the line of succession.    But that is not what happened. Polycarp omitted any mention of a Pope. The position had not even been invented. The only Church at the outset which existed was the true church of the true Christians.|`|o9cAl8xhaa	In this passage, Christ is establishing the 'Office of the Keys', the power to forgive or retain sin in His Name.

Matthew 16:13-19    Peter's Confession of Christ   When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"   They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."  "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"  Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ,[b] the Son of the living God." Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter,[c] and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades[d] will not overcome it.[e] I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be[f] bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be[g] loosed in heaven." Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.|`|jsuySwTVaa	Heaven, like Eden, is the domain of God.  As with Adam and Eve, no other gods are allowed.  Adam and Eve got kicked out of Eden when they became "as gods," knowing good and evil.  And therein lies the secret to the keys of heaven. Christ told us that to enter heaven we must be as little children (Mat 18:3) and children are defined at De 1:39 as those having no knowledge of good and evil.    The keys are in the hands of the Almighty.........period.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	very good.  yes that is what we call Apostolic succession  CJ, my friend this must really be hard for you to cover up, cause your answer made no sense at all.|`|VzCygD6taa	Peter was not ordained on this or any other occasion        Matthew 16:13-19 NIV    13  When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"    14  They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."    15  "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"    16  Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."    17  Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.    18  And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.    19  I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."    The rock referred to is the statement  "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."  Which Jesus says God had reviled to Peter.    Hades is the grave     G86  ????   hade?s  hah'-dace  From G1 (as a negative particle) and G1492; properly unseen, that is, Hades or the place (state) of departed souls: - grave, hell.    The soul is simply the body in which you live and has no identity after death.    Genesis 2:7 KJV    And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.    And    Genesis 3:19 KJV  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.    But we are not with out hope      John 3:16-18 KJV    16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.    17  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.    18  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.    This is the key with which Peter and the other apostles were able to unlock a hope for the future.

Then we can travel overseas to Mexico where the Sun God of the Aztecs conceived a child with a virgin with the result of Toltecs Quetzalcoatl with another immaculate conception and the list goes on.    Oh then there was Mohammed who also was a result of a virgin birth who's mother was visited by an angel in the night. Hmmmm lots of virgin births around the world in those days.

One should use the complete Bible and not the condensed Protestant one anyway. God bless!    In Christ  Fr.

Last time I looked they believed in salvation through jesus, the holy trinity etc etc etc...|`|O1xSW736aa	Jenny, all catholics are christians and until the 16th Century all christians were catholic.  It was only the protestant reformation (and Henry VIII's need for a divorce) that produced the many other denominations we see today.    apart from a few extra books I don't think there is a lot of difference.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Those extra books used to be in the KJV !!!!  I have a copy right here with them. Pope Luther liked those books quite a bit but gave a Papal ruling that they are not henceforth to be considered Scripture, undoing almost 1500 years of them being Scripture.     But he is your Pope, you have to obey.|`|WjRqYf6naa	You do realize, of course, that Catholics are Christians?

Christians are even allowed to read non-Christian books.  Certainly they are permitted to read Christian books.      You wrote  because they've got extra stuff in there that's not in the christian bible    ?  Someone has misinformed you.  By the biblical definition, *and* by the English language definition, Roman Catholics are Christians.

The so-called "Catholic Bible" is simply the original Christian Bible, before Luther started tearing out books he didn't like, in the 16th Century.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	First of all, they are both Christian, it is Catholic or Protestant.     The only differences are basically the Catholic Bible was translated at a different time than the King James, so there is some difference in language and phrases. There is no Book of Ecclesiastics in the Catholic Bible, and a couple of books I can't recall in the Catholic and not the Protestant. Now there are many translations of the Bible, so the differences are not as big a deal, many Protestants use different translations in the same service. The Book of Revelations has a different name in the Catholic Bible, but it is the same.     When I was a young and had gone to a Catholic school, a classmate was very upset when I picked up a King James Bible somewhere and looked through it. She thought sure I was going to the Devil's Place right away. I've known Protestants who say the "Catholic Bible" is not the Bible.     They are the almost same with some variations. The really important things though, Genesis and the other books from the "Torah", the major Prophets, and of course the New Testament, I don't think there are any differences.     Sure, Catholics would not have known about Ecclesiastics without "Turn, Turn, Turn", but mostly it is the same. The difference is interpretation in what is said, and how much it is read, usually traditionally less by Catholics.|`|AA11440601	Catholic Christians do not mind if you use a Catholic Bible. I cannot speak for non-Catholic Christians. Except for a few books there is no difference.    Protestants have fully accepted each and every one of the 27 books that the Catholics selected for the New Testament over 1,500 years ago.    The difference in the Old Testaments actually goes back to the time before and during Christs life. At this time, there was no official Jewish canon of scripture.    The Jews in Egypt translated their choices of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek in the second century before Christ. This translation of 46 books, called the Septuagint, had wide use in the Roman world because most Jews lived far from Palestine in Greek cities. Many of these Jews spoke only Greek.    The early Christian Church was born into this world. The Church, with its bilingual Jews and more and more Greek-speaking Gentiles, used the books of the Septuagint as its Bible. Remember the early Christians were just writing the documents what would become the New Testament.    After the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, with increasing persecution from the Romans and competition from the fledgling Christian Church, the Jewish leaders came together and declared its official canon of Scripture, eliminating seven books from the Septuagint.     The books removed were Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom (of Solomon), Sirach, and Baruch. Parts of existing books were also removed including Psalm 151 (from Psalms), parts of the Book of Esther, Susanna (from Daniel as chapter 13), and Bel and the Dragon (from Daniel as chapter 14).    The Christian Church filled with the Holy Spirit did not follow suit but kept all the books in the Septuagint. 46 + 27 = 73 Books total.    1500 years later, Protestants decided to keep the Catholic New Testament but change its Old Testament from the Catholic canon to the Jewish canon.     The books that were removed supported such things as   ? Prayers for the dead (Tobit 12:12; 2 Maccabees 12:39-45)  ? Purgatory (Wisdom 3:1-7)  ? Intercession of saints in heaven (2 Maccabees 15:14)  ? Intercession of angels (Tobit 12:12-15)    The books they dropped are sometimes called the Apocrypha.    Here is a Catholic Bible website: http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/    With love in Christ.|`|agk5PFl1aa	We are allowed to read anything.|`|8TVD0koDaa	y not..no law saying u can't|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	The Apocrypha has some interesting history.

Christians are encouraged to read any version of the Bible, unless you belong to a certain sect or denomination of Christianity that forbids it.  The Catholic Bible IS the Christian Bible. It just includes extra books.  I think, though, you'd be hard-pressed not to find a Protestant Bible nowadays.

They are a denomination of Christianity. Anyone following Jesus Christ is determined as Christian. Also, the Bible is the same for all denominations. It's the interpretations that vary as well as their declarations of faith. (Catholics have pretty much the same declaration of faith with the eastern Orthodoxes only they add the "filioque". That means they believe that the Holy Spirit comes from both the Father and the Son while Orthodoxes say only from the Father. Christian stuff.)|`|pakIAYWoaa	no worries read away..the other books are not evil they are just not considered on a par with scripture.

9mK4YF9Vaa	Hello! I am President of a Community Service Club for my high school. Let me just say, you feel pretty amazing knowing that you are helping someone. Whether it be raising money for a good cause, building a house for habitat for humanity, or helping at the animal shelter...you always come out feeling great!   Do not think of a volunteer as a servant, these are completely different things! Servants to not have a choice of what to do, volunteering should come from the heart and you should do it because you want to.  Go out there and meet people who can benefit from your generosity!   It's so much fun too!  (:|`|2u8teJkJaa	I do think its important. I have been a volunteer for animal control for 4 years. There are many things that I have learned that I now have a vet.asst. cert. and plan to get a Vet.Tech. License. Volunteering can turn into careers and help you with the direction that you make take.I got my handicapped chihuahua at the shelter that is now a therapy dog who goes into hospitals, schools, and sees private hospice patients. The only reward that you will need or get will be the smiles on peoples faces and the love from the animals in my case. Choose some thing that you are interested in and try it. The reward I get is when the nurse says that a patient has not smiled, been alert, or able to speak in a long time. With my dog all these have been made possible.    lar: Volunteer coordinators work very hard training, doing orientations, and keeping records. I am a VOLUNTEER volunteer coordinator because I think its important to help others come in to volunteer. I don't hinder my volunteers in any way.I work side by side with my volunteers and do the same work. I give them different choices for jobs that are open and let them choose. No matter where you go there will be saftey rules and policys to go by to protect the volunteer as well as the people/animals that you are helping. you have a very bad attitude about volunteering. Just because your not getting paid does not mean we have to put up with you.....|`|BNlSh53faa	I'm interested in your doubts.  Even as a volunteer you almost have to put yourself first.  If you have  a project given to you by a volunteer coordinator you have assimilate the data in your head that will make it work, you have say to other people who butt  in and and tell you you're not doing it right to butt off and let you alone.  Volunteerism is not a cushy job sometimes.  You have to assert yourself in ways you never did in the work force.  Why is volunteering so important, because sometimes volunteering is the only way people get a fair shake who have suffered loss and trauma.  The only reward I want from volunteering is to say I achieved the goal I set out to achieve.  I went to the Iowa floods this last year and said my goal was to get one family secure by winter.  We achieved our goal, despite the volunteer administration who will deter you, detain you, not let you achieve your goal even though they're not doing they the work, they're the great interferer's.

bM4CdZb2aa	Always. Keep praying.  God will answer your prayers in His OWN time.  It may not be in the way you're expecting, but he ALWAYS answers them.|`|HgVLhCr9aa	God is concerned more about your spiritual growth than your happiness.  Difficult times will come your way, and how you act in these "crucible" times will define you.    I believe that God uses times of crisis and hardship in the lives of people to draw them to himself.  They see that they've screwed up, and that their "life is a mess", and they turn to him for help.    Even pagans do that.    If you want your life to be better, here are a few things you can do:    1) Accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ as an atonement for your own sins.  You will be saved from the wrath of God on the Day of Judgement, and the punishment that should go to you will go to him instead.  2) Having accepted Christ as saviour, accept him now as 'lord' or 'master'.  Put aside your own selfish ambition and all of your sins, and live a life that pleases God.  3) If you do those things, you will likely have a desire to do what is right (call this 'virtue').  To learn what *is* right: read the Bible, speak with Christians about things you're uncertain of, and listen to your own conscience (but check it against scripture!).    If your life is a mess, and you're sinning (disobeying God), the best advice I can give you is to stop sinning (and start obeying God).  You've screwed things up by doing them your own way.    Try this instead:    But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.    Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude.

What is it about your life that needs to be "fixed"?    If it is an emotional thing, you'll grow out of it.    If it is a physical problem, learn to see the beauty there.    If it is a family problem, don't make it YOUR problem, no matter HOW hard that seems to be.    If it is a sin problem, you need to repent.    God will NEVER abandon you.  Jesus said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."    But what is it you want God to help you with?  If you pray, pray specifically, otherwise you'll never know if God answered.    God bless you in your "struggles" with life.  God's word says, "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile."

One night a man had a dream. He dreamed   he was walking along the beach with the LORD.      Across the sky flashed scenes from his life.  For each scene he noticed two sets of  footprints in the sand: one belonging  to him, and the other to the LORD.        When the last scene of his life flashed before him,  he looked back at the footprints in the sand.      He noticed that many times along the path of  his life there was only one set of footprints.        He also noticed that it happened at the very  lowest and saddest times in his life.      This really bothered him and he  questioned the LORD about it:      "LORD, you said that once I decided to follow  you, you'd walk with me all the way.  But I have noticed that during the most  troublesome times in my life,  there is only one set of footprints.  I don't understand why when  I needed you most you would leave me."        The LORD replied:      "My son, my precious child,  I love you and I would never leave you.  During your times of trial and suffering,  when you see only one set of footprints,  it was then that I carried you."|`|3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	Of course.    Everything works for the good for those who trust in the Lord.    Trust God.  Meditate on His scripture. Also, if we ask for wisdom (Godly wisdom) God gives freely. If we don't doubt or if we are specific to God in prayer.    So write on paper the things specifically need help in your life. Give them to Jesus. Make your plans as wisdom comes. Write down the plans. Give Your plans to God. And He will open the doors for you, miraculously.    Meditate on who you are in Christ.  Some verses on line:  http://www.fathersloveletter.com  http://www.365promises.com    God wants us to write down our plans. Set our course. And He makes it happen.

Whenever you do anything, do you consider God?     We all perform for an audience of 1. That one being will be the only other person there when we have to confess what we have done in our lives and what we've done with His son and what we've done with the things He has given us to sustain us in this life. What will you have to say for yourself?     Consider that we live in a world that was MADE perfect, but is marred by sin. We live in a world that has a REMNANT of beauty, but is still broken. That is why we see all the things that we see going on. Yet, God is still there.    So, yes. God can and will change your life, but are you willing to accept it. He has sent His spirit to do what? To TESTIFY to the truth. Where do we find His truth? His word. So, He's not gonna do it for you. You have to bury yourself daily into what it says and contemplate it. As you go out in life, the spirit will remind you of what you already know, but it is still up to you as to whether you want to do it or not.     God didn't create robots. He created us to CHOOSE to worship Him. Yet we often would rather worship our own desires. He created us to CHOOSE Him. Yet, we often will choose ourselves. And He sent His son to save us. Yet we often reject Him.     It's OUR choice. What will you choose?|`|zbAKxm0daa	This question is so old that amongst the many Pagan fables that the Christians hijacked, there is a story of a man who was fishing and his boat sank into the sea.      He prayed to his gods to be saved.  After hours had passed, there had been a few boats which had come along and offered to take him to shore.  He turned them all down saying that "The Gods will save me".  He eventually drowned and went before his gods and asked why they didn't save him.    Their answer was "We sent boat after boat to you and you refused to be helped".    The Christians, of course, shortened this already abbreviated version of the story to "God helps those that help themselves".    Since you gave no details about the mess that you have, so we can't help much more than giving the following advice;    If your life is a mess, then examine what, precisely, is a mess and see how much of it you could have prevented and how much was truly out of your control.      Accept responsibility for anything which you have done to make things the way that they are by failing to prevent it and accept that there are some things that are just plain out of your control.      Fix what you can and work towards helping to fix everything that you can do something to help make it better.      Accept that there are some things that you just have to suffer through and take the lessons of those experiences with you for the future.    If you depend on "God" for everything, then you are a truly poor human being.  The Gods give all of us brains and the ability to think with them for a reason and you appear to have either forgotten that fact or were never taught it.    You are going through a hard time and everyone does.  Every difficulty that we go through is to give us the ability to work through a part of life.  they are lessons that we all must go through.    You have the tools to deal with this, either within yourself or with the help of friends and family.  Friends and family are supposed to be there for each other.  Ask your friends for help if you cannot do it alone.  Ask your family for help if you cannot do it alone.      Real friends and good family will help.|`|S2ZccVFAaa	Sometimes God speaks in ways that we don't understand. It's hard to figure out what the "God voice" is with so many things going on in our lives. Don't listen to those who say that God or Jesus is a fairy tale. There are several extra-biblical (things that are not in the bible, like books or scrolls) people who wrote about Jesus. Jesus was and is real. The cool thing about Jesus is that He loves us unconditionally, just as we are, even the bad stuff.     Everyone on earth has been in a mess at some point in our lives. Before I gave my life to Christ (otherwise known as Jesus or God) I was without hope. I don't even want to think about where I would be if I hadn't given my life to Him. Because I was a sinner I was alienated from God. It was because of all the sinful and evil stuff that I did. But when I realized I had to change, I professed my sins to Jesus and gave them all to Him. When He died on the cross He died for those sins, he is the one that paid the penalty.     I don't mean to turn this into a preaching sermon. But if you give it all to Jesus, and believe in Him you will at least not have to worry about some of those burdens. There are some things God will not do because it goes against His nature. He cannot take away things we have done but He can take away the guilt and sin...take the sin away from the person. Sometimes we have to put quite a bit of effort into fixing what we have messed up. God will help us along the way, He will carry us when we feel like we can't go on anymore.     Remember Jeremiah 29:11. For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.|`|RbUbMTqOaa	keep praying you are young it will come to you|`|wMeQoXkzaa	Keep praying.

These things are disturbing but not uncommon and  not dangerous. They can be treated with some light   medication of various types. Other ideas involve  changes to diet and exercise, sleeping on your  stomach instead of the back (improves breathing)  and relaxation by meditating before bed.    Two other points. Spirits or demons may appear at  any time. If you only have these experiences in bed,   chances are it's just a sleep disorder.     Second, demons cause harm that leaves evidence,   such as injuries or dammage to your property. That  hasn't happened so you can rule demons out, and  spirits are location-bound, so if you go to sleep  somewhere else and it still happens, it can't be a  spirit...     If some research and basic self-help doesn't work,   consider seeing your doctor. But if the situation   changes and there is cause to suspect a genuine   spirit or demon, you had better contact a pagan   Priestess, Shaman or Druid.

U24VtSlZaa	Legally, they have to be still married.  If they live in a jurisdiction that doesn't allow same sex marriages, they will still be married until a legal issue arises that is substantial enough for someone to file a lawsuit, then a court will decide.  The decision will be appealed and appealed again, until the loser petitions the Supreme Court for certiorari, which will almost certainly be granted.  Which side will prevail depends on how many justices retire between now and then, and who is in the white house when they retire.  But it will take awhile for it to wind it's way through the courts, and in the meantime, Congress might pass a law that renders the case moot.    Morally and ethically, I think yes they are, but I'm assuming that the tranny had his/her spouses agreement before the surgery.  It'd be morally reprehensible for one spouse to transgender over the other's objection, without divorcing first.    Spiritually speaking, I'm guessing yes, since matters of spirituality should be gender-neutral.    [edit:  the lawsuit I'm thinking of would likely be from, say, a health insurance claim where only a legal spouse would have coverage.

But some will ask, Will this ever be? We answer, If the "new heavens and new earth" are to be just our present material system purified by fire and transfigured, of course it will. But we incline to think that the aspiration which we are taught in this beautiful petition to breathe forth has no direct reference to any such organic fulfilment, and is only the spontaneous and resistless longing of the renewed soulput into wordsto see the whole inhabited earth in entire conformity to the will of God. It asks not if ever it shall beor if ever it can bein order to pray this prayer. It must have its holy yearnings breathed forth, and this is just the bold yet simple expression of them.

If Heaven is the ultimate goal and the reward for living a good life, it is impossible to do the same thing on earth becasue earth is the test to get into Heaven.|`|vxzyYVeYaa	Most people imagine heaven as a realm of peace and tranquillity. The Scriptures refer to heaven as Jehovahs lofty abode of holiness and beauty. (Isaiah 63:15) No wonder we pray that Gods will take place upon earth as in heaven! But will this ever happen?    Jehovahs prophet Daniel foretold: The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these [earthly] kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite. (Daniel 2:44) This heavenly Kingdom, or government, will soon take action to bring about global peace under righteous rule.2?Peter 3:13.    Praying for Gods Kingdom to come and for his will to be done on earth is an expression of faith that will not lead to disappointment. The Christian apostle John wrote: I heard a loud voice from the throne say: Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away. Then John added: And the One seated on the throne said: .?.?. Write, because these words are faithful and true.Revelation 21:3-5.|`|DjJRUv9Paa	Gods mission is in motion and we are to carry the torch until his second coming.

Possibly related to global warming, but that's not conclusively connected.

Global warming is a scientific fraud, not unlike macro evolution.    The anger of God is manifested towards the damned in Hell. But here on earth we can rightly assume that all wars are a punishment from God, insofar as God is a God of peace and not war. When the Israelites withdrew from the friendship of God He allowed them to be overrun by their enemies. Europe, once the CENTRE of Christendom, has made attempts to apostatize from the Catholic Faith during the Protestant Reformation and the French Revolution. Both World Wars were punishments from God. The latest punishment from God was not a world war but a revolution in the Catholic Church was has resulted in a loss of faith. God permitted the enemies of the Catholic Church to infiltrate Her and attempt to destroy Her from within. Truly there can be no greater punishment from God than the contraction of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church that Jesus Christ, true God and true Man, founded, and outside of which there is absolutely no salvation.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	What global warming?

ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	At school and with parents Thai students are usually very respectful.  In groups the boys can be macho show offs trying to outdo each other.    Thais generally prefer Thai food, first choice being somtam.  Teenagers usually like western fast food, KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonalds.    They are usually very much into mobile phones, SMS and Thai pop music.    Computers, yes but less so as they prefer to be on the move, out with friends.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	sounds like your expecting a creature not a person? americans think they are superior to everyone else    you mean bacon "sandwich", hope its not a student studying english|`|1CVOHoapaa	If they are coming to you my guess is that they want to sample your lifestyle.

If he is a strict Buddhist he could have some things he can't eat (you can google that) but this is very unlikely as most Thai people, who are not monks/nuns, don't take this too seriously. I have a Thai friend that has to go vegetarian/can't drink alcohol for about two weeks every year because of Buddhism but that is quite rare.   Thai people generally eat beef, chicken and pork, unless they Muslim (about 4% of the Thai population) in which case the normal rules for Muslims apply.  Thai teenagers are not particularly 'techy' but hard to generalise - same as English. If he's a student he might want to study a lot but Thai students, in my experience, aren't the most industrious students compared to say Chinese.  If his family can afford to send him to a langyage school outside Thailand chances are that he's from the top 1% of the Thai population in which case he will be very polite. Play your cards right and he'll probably invite you to stay at the family weekend house back in Thailand next Christmas.

macZI2dzaa	The first and greatest commandment is to love God with all your heart.  The second is like it, to love your neighbor as yourself. That is found in Mark 12.29-31.

You should love Him more than anyone or anything in your entire life. Then everyone else is next.     Deuteronomy 6:5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.     Luke 14:26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.    The above scripture means that there can be no one in our life more loved or more important that the Lord our God.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	It's the same thing.   Loving your neighbour is the same as loving God.    Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount    What you do to the least of your brothers, this you do to Me.

H1TZzRBkaa	India is a big country, The North east is closest to china. Its also closest to Philippines and Japan. The reasons why they look chinese and what you said more so then the rest of india, is because they live closer and have mingled with each-other a lot more as a coincidence of living near each-other, therefor inherit some looks.    Oh and all of india is in Asia :]  The ones in the south have more pigment (wich makes there skin darker) This is just evolution, people that live in the south have darkerskin to block out the suns rase, wile people in the north have whiter skin to soak up as much vitamin D from the suns raise as posible as in the north, there isnt much sun as it can be cloudy, so we need as much sun (vitamin D) as we can get when the sun is out, its evolution, all animals change to suit there environment through natural selection, (Evolution).    Wich is also how new speicies begin and come into the world, if a bunch of humans were frown in a diffrent area of the world and no longer reproduced with another from another side of the world, Very slowly they would start to change and eventualy after a maybe 100 thousand years or more, they may become a seperate speices.

Q14BYoWLaa	A lot do not. In fact outside of a couple of models I see very few Black women with short blond hair and the few I have seen look stunning.    They do it because they want to and they like it.  If you think it looks horrible, don't look. I'm sure they don't care at all about your opinion of their hair.|`|thVN9X2Baa	Well when you point out a particular race of people and claim they all do something, then that is racist.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	They do it because they like the way it looks. Your opinion is irrelevant to them.|`|DeuKCARsaa	"ALOT" do not do this.     Perhaps this is a style in their neighborhood.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	I wear my hair extremely short and did dye my hair blonde for my birthday and went to Las Vegas.  Just something to be different.  It drew too much attention from men and I promptly let it grow out after I returned home.  You may think it looks masculine but there's a lot more to a woman than her hair that makes her look feminine...|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Trying to look different. Its hideious|`|6ABvgu4iaa	They want to try something new, ya know change it up.  may be easier to take care of  they just like the color  or a combo of all three!|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	There is an old saying that perfectly explains this phenomenon: beauty is in the eye of the beholder.    For every person like you who hates that look, there is someone else who thinks it looks great.|`|iLwwFfTdaa	I think that it is not a racial racist if you like f african american.    They have the right to make their hairstyle free.   You have the freedom what it thinks of it.   However, you'd better not say it.|`|zrhJHsUxaa	80% of the women I know are black and not one cuts their hair and dyes it blonde.      Stop generalizing black women because by no means are they all the same.     I will tell you one thing that is the same....how come its always someone white asking why black people this and why black people that? You dont see every other question on here asking why whites this and that.     Tell me what is it that makes whites on here want to know so much about us?

I don't think it's a racist question. White people usually have a bland style, conservative look while people of color push the envelope a lot more.  It's natural...look back in history, you didn't find many Europeans with face paint and colorful coustumes like you find in Africa and Asia and Latin countries.  It's just a cultural diffrence that's all.|`|RoVKNHcAaa	Because that's what they want to do. They dont look for your approval.      ~ Well, the next time u see one i suggest u stop them and ask.
JHLtUEtCaa	1. Reserve the night at a hotel and take him to his favorite restaurant and then go back to the hotel.  2. Fill his bedroom with pink and red balloons and inside put a different reasons why you love him. Leave a note saying something like, "Just pop the balloons to count the ways I love you".  3. Make him his favorite dinner and decorate the table with valentine's stuff.  4. Give him a customized picture frame with a picture of you two.  5. Make him a scrapbook of pictures from the last 3 years.  6. Decorate his car and fill it with balloons.  7.

Maybe some cute lingerie and a nice dinner|`|p2k6F7Tgaa	How bout a simple card?|`|oN9GUEAEaa	First, you should know him pretty well after 3 and a half years so think about what he likes.     If he likes music, get him a cd, or better yet, make him a mix tape. If he likes movies, buy him a movie that he's been wanting. If he's into video games, get a game he doesn't have.     If you are looking for cheap, making something yourself is the way to go. Not only is it cheap, but it would mean more to him than something you bought because you made it yourself. So try making a mix tape or a photo collage of the two of you.    Hope this helps.|`|GJrxSjybaa	kisses|`|gShTyx5Saa	ya. i have a good idea to present a precious gift for my lover which could be more marvellous than him.|`|2UOrO5rCaa	wow, u date him for 3 1/2 years and u dont know what to give? if u are his girlfriend, u know everything what he wants or he needs..   ask his family or his friends if u need the answer..
HxcTuTSQaa	Eastern European languages belong to different language groups than those you have learned so far. While it might be interesting to learn them, they will also be harder than the structured, positional western languages.     In most east-european countries many young people know at least one western language and that number will grow, so even if you will have contacts to people from the country you know the language of, you wouldn't have trouble communicating with them in English anyway.
swkhohjgaa	All couples have fights, when you stop fighting the relationship is usually over. But there are different types of fights. If hes violent he needs help. If not maybe he was brought up in an environment where everyone argued a lot? My wife cannot take any type of constructive criticism because  her family was always insulting each other.  Some times its not what you see, but what you don't, thats the root of the anger.  If you can find it you can work around it.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Stop nagging him. Learn to pick and choose your battles.|`|dC7nBu53aa	I think he was just stress out at the time, because of all the work.   But what he said was actually really harsh.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	"Something else" is going on in his life...it isn't just you...  And, there are 'so many' possibilities of the things that could be going on it's impossible to say...maybe it's his job, or potential loss of his job...maybe he's frustrated because he's gay or bisexual...maybe he's worried about paying the bills...maybe he's got a girlfriend...  Who knows what the 'real problem' is that is causing him to get angy...  I would encourage you to find a professional psychologist who can assist both you and your husband in finding out what the 'problem' is...  Maybe it's just difficulty in a man relating to a woman...you know "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" type of thing...|`|67z7HHTJaa	u deserve the fairy tale  everyone does  tell him when hes being a good husband  "say husband, it really hurts me when u say things like that..."  and say that u love it when hes being nice and stuff    and btw....even though u are husband and wife u should still appreciate each other and be kind and respectful...it just looks and feels nicer that way...u absolutely SHOULD say please and thankyou to one another...thats cute! hes wrong...    but next time hes in a bad mood just leave him alone...dont nag at him!!!|`|i4Vt4YJ4aa	All relationships have ups and downs in different ways....So all you need to try to communicate in an adult way.    If he don't appreciate to say thank you to you after you have helped him, then just he has a bad attitude. Anyway try to avoid his short temper, just try to help him without having expectations of "thanks" from him in return. Good luck!|`|InlCtFHuaa	adapting to a new culture,environment,friends,etc., is very stressfu; and men have the added burden where they often have to maintain duel personalities/lives because they are expected to be on point,show little emotion, be aggressive and physical....yet also have demands to switch it off like a faucet and become very gentle,sensitive and meek.    it's hard being a man    and learning a new language asap is tremendous added burden
0KR4wyoQaa	Yeah, it's Portuguese.|`|UTKYOWdaaa	It means: "I am content"|`|KaIryVwCaa	It's Portuguese.  You'll have to rely on someone else for the translation, but "Estou contente" means "I'm [very] happy or content, "e conseguir" in Spanish would mean to "and to follow with or to follow closely, to be congruent with", uma is "a or an", and "para casa" is usually translated as "for the house", or "through the house" or "as a house".  Not sure what "uma boa" is and what "por Nohea" translates as.  Someone else will let you know for sure.  Where are all you Brazilians, Azoreans and Portugues speakers out there?|`|Oll0CHkbaa	It says "I am glad that Nohea is in a good home"...Nohea is a Hawaiian word for "handsome" that is used mainly as a boy's name.

Of course, like ANY group, some are down right mean and vindictive, so one ought not ask about atheists in general, but about SOME atheists in particular.

An athiest can be that for a number of reasons. Athiest as someone who doubts the existnace of a God.    When I was young I was a self proclaimed Athiest.  I saw a horrendous amount of abuse all around me and much towards children. It made more sense to believe there was no God because if there was a God he/or she would have to be a horrible God to allow such defensless innocent children to suffer in such ways.    I say..be carefull not to judge others for thier choices in beliefs. You are not them and you have no way of knowing why they believe what they do.     While your at it why dont you condemn Scientist who have been known to support the evolution theory. We are all at a different place in our lives. Enjoy yours where you are at and perhaps help others .    You will certainly not promote Christianity the way you are going about it.

Whatever it is, they cannot harm you.|`|lvjAxFGxaa	spirits aren't evil as far as we know they could be here to protect us . but try hard not to avoid|`|TjrnVFVRaa	Fear not!    In general Spirits are not harmful, in fact if they are trying to contact you, it is because they need something from you. They maybe trapped here in this world and trying to move on to the next plane, but they need something done in thsi world before they can do it. If they are trying to contact you, it is because you may have the abiilty to help them out!    The next time you feel the presence of a spirit,  remain calm and think soothing thoughts, close your eyes, and take a deep breath. The slowly open your eyes and clear your mind to let the thoughts the spirit may be trying to send you into your mind.    If you do recieve the thoughts, you will know it! And you may be able to help the spirit move on.|`|3iFzMwVPaa	Don't worry you're not alone... I also worry about ghosts and spirits before I go to bed.

(Ideally, the receptionist should have asked to take your coat if they have a place for it in their area).  As for when he walked in, in business a lot of the gender specific rules are set aside, certainly if it's one-on-one.  I would have stood to shake his hand and introduce myself.  If he's standing right next to you, you wind up speaking to his nether regions.      Most of the time, when you are making the move to stand up, a gentleman will ask you to remain seated.  Whatever you had to do or were asked to do, I believe you should have made the effort to be face to face, though I don't think there is much harm done here.|`|AA10067344	Taking your coat off indoors is always acceptable.  It is a woman's prerogative to stand or not during an introduction.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Taking off your coat was correct, in a social situation you don't rise when a man enters.

If you were, you would have had to awkwardly put it back on in front of the interviewer, not really the polished professional image I am sure you would like to project.  Lady or not, your interviewer is in this situation your "superior", so yes, the protocol is for you to stand up during the introduction.    Good luck with the job, I am sure you will be judged on your skills and merits rather than a small incident at the receiving area.  All the best!

Maybe there is a local place where you can call and ask them about volunteering your time to help out. I know senior centers always need help too. I always try to help a person when I can. It can also be in the smallest way to, esp in the things we who aren't disabled can take for granted. Even if I'm grabbing something off the shelf for an old person or someone in a wheel chair.    One time I was at a fast food place and a disabled man was getting out of his vehicle (he was disabled/paralyzed) and he had the motorized wheel chair. Well he was obviously going to have trouble getting in the doors, so I got up from my seat (because i was staring and wondering how hard this must be for him) and went to open the doors. I even carried his tray and got his drink for him. He was very appreciative......I felt really good after that.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	Lobby your US senators and Congressmen to enforce the ADA:    Send them this letter:    My friend asked me to bring this to your attention.    The ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), as well as other civil rights laws, has become scrap paper due to lack of enforcement by the government.  The EEOC has failed its mission to uphold the laws.  She was fired from a job In June 2005 due to disability discrimination.  The big accommodation she asked for was to be exempt (due to her disability) from an out of state meeting with the sole purpose of the company telling the employees about the benefits the company offered the employees, apparently not an essential function of the job.  She repeatedly notified her employer in writing, including certified return receipt mail.  They claimed they knew nothing about the request.  Her former employer gave her numerous excellent performance evaluations, but claimed she was fired for poor performance.  She submitted this evidence, but the EEOC took her employers denial over the evidence.  A recent review of the statistics on the EEOCs own website demonstrates its failure.  For example, in 2005, of 10,135 cases of disability discrimination that were supposedly investigated by the EEOC, 9,268 were declared no reasonable cause by the commission.  That is 91% of the cases..  That is illogical.  It seems more likely that they deal the cases into 10 piles.  In the first 9 piles, the cases are rubberstamped as no reasonable cause and the reasonable cause stamp is used on the 10th pile.  This is evidenced by the fact that of the 867 cases that are declared to have cause, 529 (61%) are unsuccessful.  The EEOC was wrong more than half the time.  It is conceivable that they were wrong on many cases that were stamped no reasonable cause and the victims sent on their way with permission to pursue a case against the employer in court.  Victims, such as herself who was just robbed of $45,000 by discriminatory actions, are then turned away by lawyers who arent interested in taking discrimination cases on contingency.  She appealed to her senators and congressmen: they simply asked EEOC if they did their job and accepted their affirmation despite the evidence.      IF you are in NJ-add this:    The state governments behavior is worse.  Prior to losing her job, She repeatedly appealed to NJ Protection and Advocacy and was ignored (which is consistent with her past experience with them).  NJDCR (New Jersey Division on Civil Rights) ignored her repeated requests for them to review the EEOC finding that were sent via return receipt mail and communicated through her state senators and assembly representatives-until she sent a notice of intent to sue the state of NJ for failing to appropriately investigate.  At that point, NJDCR hastily upheld the EEOCs decision, seemingly ignoring the facts.  She appealed to the NJ Public Advocate, submitting yet another large file of evidence.  They simply asked NJDCR if they did their job and accepted their affirmation despite the evidence.  Another company hired her 3 years ago.  At this company, not only is she doing the same type of job she had been fired from, but she has additional responsibilities.  And, shortly after her incident, numerous supervisors from her agency were fired or reassigned.  These facts diminish the credibility of her former employers statements even more.  The governments inaction has encouraged her former employer, and other employers, to continue discriminating at will.
XN0cYCATaa	Christianity is a religion based upon the teachings and miracles of Jesus. Jesus is the Christ. The word "christ" means anointed one.  Christ is not Jesus' last name.  Jesus is the anointed one from God the Father who came to this world, fulfilled the Old Testament laws and prophecies, died on the cross, and rose from the dead physically. He performed many miracles which were recorded in the Gospels by the eyewitnesses.  He is divine in nature as well as human.  Thus, He has two natures and is worthy of worship and prayer.     Christianity teaches that there is only one God in all existence, that God made the universe, the Earth, and created Adam and Eve. God created man in His image. This does not mean that God has a body of flesh and bones.  Image means the likeness of God's character, rationality, etc.  Because we are made in the image of God, every person is worthy of respect and honor.  Furthermore, this means that we did not evolve through random processes from a single celled organism into rational, emotional beings.     God created Adam and Eve and put them in the Garden of Eden and gave them the freedom to choose between right and wrong. They chose to sin. Sin is doing that which is contrary to the nature and will of God.  For example, God cannot lie; therefore, lying is sin.  The sin of disobeying God that Adam and Eve committed resulted in them being expelled from the Garden of Eden as well as suffering the effect of death.     As a result of their sin, their children and all of us inherited a sinful nature.  In other words, our offspring are not perfect in nature -- we don't have to teach children to be selfish.  They know it naturally.  That which is sinful cannot produce that which is not sinful.     Christianity teaches that God is a Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, not three Gods), that Jesus Christ is the second person of the Trinity, that Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead physically, that all people are under the righteous judgment of God because all people have sinned against God.  It teaches that Jesus is the only way to be saved from the coming judgment of God and that salvation is received by faith in the work of Christ on the cross and not by anything that we can do to please God.     Where all other religions in the world teach that we must do some sort of good in cooperation with God in order to achieve the right to be in God's presence, Christianity is the only religion that teaches salvation by grace.  This means that we are not made right before God by our efforts, sincerity, or works.  Instead, we are made right before God by faith in what Christ did on the cross.       Christianity further teaches that once a person is "born again" (becomes saved) that the Holy Spirit lives in that person and the person is changed:  "Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come," (2 Cor. 5:17).  This means that God actually lives in the person and the Christian then experiences a true and living relationship with God.     Therefore, "What is Christianity?" is best answered by saying that it is a relationship with the true and living God through the person of Jesus Christ by whom we are forgiven of our sins and escape the righteous judgment of God.|`|AA11849917	"Christianity" is that belief system that follows the teachings of Jesus Christ.    But it's more than just mere teaching, because of what He said about Himself.    He said he is equivalent to God before He was ever born.  The religious leaders of his day acknowledged his claim, otherwise they would not have tried to stone him for blasphemy if he had NOT made those kinds of claims.    So, Christianity is more than mere rituals and religious activities - it is reconciliation with our Creator, and getting back in line with what we are supposed to be like - saints, instead of the sinners we have become.  (Yes, we have become sinners because we sin, but Jesus Christ died to pay the panalty for our sins, then rose again the morning of the third day, just as He said He would do, thus proving once and for all time that He truly is who He claimed to be, the very Son of God - or God incarnate in a physical, human body.)    That is the crux of what Christianity is all about.  There is a lot more that could be said, but that's the foundation on which it rests.  One song says it like this:   "My hope is built on nothing less  Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.    I dare not trust the sweetest frame,  but wholly lean on Jesus' Name.    On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand,  All other ground is sinking sand;  All other ground is sinking sand."|`|1bJ6KV0paa	A cult.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Most Christians on this site will give you different answers to that question so you might want to research wiki instead.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The Bible is about JESUS.  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Actually the true Christian Church as followed in the first and second centuries AD is likely very different from the Christianity practiced today by Roman Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism.

(google; Joseph Smith)|`|ltu3iKJYaa	a fake religon that believs jesus died for the christians for their sins that they committed and also they believe jesus is god. FAKE RELIGON|`|r0M7gVP7aa	Christianity is the belief that: (and I'm just giving you a tiny bit of it because it would take to long to explain it all)    1) God is the Almighty Creat of of the Universe. In the Beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth. He created everything and it was all good. He created the first man and woman Adam and Eve. They lived in the Garden of Eden.    2) Adam and Eve sinned against God, the only thing he told them not to do was to not eat from a tree called The Tree of Good and Evil. They didn't listen and ate from the tree. Eve was tepmted by a serpent and she gave it to Adam and he ate the fruit too. Before this time, Adam and Eve could walk and talk freely with God and they lived in a place where God took care of all their needs. When they went against God, He made them leave the Garden and live more distant from God.     3) Them sinning, made everyone sinful. God created a new way of being able to worship Him by going to a Temple to pray and you could recieve forgiveness for your sins by animal sacrifice, the sacrifice of a perfect white lamb. But God yearned for a closer relationship with his people. But because we were imperfect and he WAS perfect, there was a seperation between God and his people (I like to picture a place with a broken out bridge where we're one side and God is on the other). God sent prophets who prophesied about a day when a man will come who would crush the head of the serpent. A man who is fully man, fully God. (By the way, at this point in time the one true religion was Judaism and the Israelites were God's chosen people. the people from whom He would bring the Messiah. Once Jesus came along, Christianity was formed).     4) For years and years, people profesied that a person who was fully man, fully God would be born to a virgin in the city of David (Bethelehem). Mary, a young virgin girl was visited by the Angel Gabriel who told her she had been chosen by God to bear God's son and she was pregnant through God's spirit. The Angel told her not to be afraid and his name would be Jesus which means "salvation" or "God Saves."     5) Jesus was born in Bethelehem to a virgin, just as the prophets said. When he became older he performed many miracles: He made the lame walk, the dumb talk and he opened blind eyes to see. He taught the people who were making religion more of a bunch of rules to follow to make their walks with God more personal, a relationship not a religion. Jesus faced every single temptation that we ever could face, but he never sinned. He was perfect, just like a sacrificial lamb.     6) Jesus and many others prophesied about his death. They said he would die so that everyone could be saved. He was crucified even though he had done nothing wrong. They mocked him and cursed him and told him he was a phony. They didn't understand that Jesus was rebuilding the bridge that Adam and Eve broke down so many years ago. He was the sacrifice for EVERYONE so that everyone could recieve forgiveness from God and accept Him as their savior so they could live with him in Heaven. Jesus paid the price for us so that we might be free from the bondage of our sins.     7) Jesus was put into a tomb and he was dead for two days. But on the third day he rose from the dead, conqueoring death. He lived on earth for 40 days. He taught the people and his disciples that he was the Way, The truth and the life. We come to God the Father  through him because Jesus is the one who died for our sins.     8) On the fortieth day, Jesus told his people to Go make disciples of every nation baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit. Then he ascended to Heaven. He lives their now with God. People did and are still doing what he said telling this story. If you choose to believe what he said and become a Christian, fully surrendering your life to God's purpose, then you will go to heaven and take advantage of the precious gift that God gave us through his son.     Other things to explain:     HOLY BIBLE: Is "god breathed" he used other people to write it but they listend to God and were obedient to what he said. The Bible is our book of widom. It gives us insight on how to live and gives us an inside look on what God is like.     HOLY SPIRIT: Those who accept Jesus gain the Holy Spirit dwelling inside of them. Basically, the Holy Spirit is an inner voice that guides you. Jesus also gave spiritual gifts to people after his ressurection these include: giving wise advice, special knowlege, discenment, speaking in tongues/ interpretation. (1 Cor. 12:2-14)    Hope I helped you understand some of it and it wasn't too confusing. Good luck on the report!

If RCIA classes are not offered, a parish priest or deacon can offer instruction.  If you were already baptized as a Christian, you are not "re-baptized", as a valid Christian baptism is considered a one time event for life. Same way if you already recieved Confirmation in another church. However, there is a rite of reception for new Catholics, and this happens after a period of instruction. You also would have your First Communion. For most parishes, the Rite of Reception/Confirmation/Baptism/Communion as applicable for adults occurs at the Easter Vigil, the Saturday before Easter Sunday.    I included a link below for your reference.|`|gkffZHF2aa	I believe you can contact any Catholic church and they'll fill you in on the classes and such.    Word of warning, bro.

So along with investigating the conversion process, you might want to develop a thick skin if you don't already have one.|`|AA10239241	Contact a priest in your local Catholic church  Sign up for R.C.I.A. classes -- Rite of Christian Inititation for Adults  If you've only been baptized as an adult (or older child) and do not believe that baptism imparts grace and forgives sins, you may need to be re-baptized -- I am not sure on that one (I am an R.C.I.A. instructor).      You will receive the Sacrament of Reconcilliation prior to the Easter Vigil (a day or 2 prior), and at the Vigil you will be Confirmed and receive your First Communion.    There are other rites as well.  For example there is the Rite of Welcome where you literally stand in the back of the Church, knock on the door and wait for the priest to answer it.  He will ask in front of those there what is it that you want.  You will reply, "The fullness of faith".  This you will do with your sponsor.  Find someone who is special to you and is a member of the Catholic Church in good standing and can journey with you.  At the beginning of Lent, there is also a special ceremony called the Rite of Election whereby you will sign your name into the Book of the Elect.  The entire process takes 1-2 years -- according to your readiness.  It is a very, very moving process.  Deeply spiritual.  God bless you on your journey!

InZU5aaxaa	I would do the beach with a picnic. Something small. I would not do a dinner, rose, stuffed animal just yet. Go out as friends on V-day. Invite a few friends to brighten her day. Then later in the day tell her how you feel. Don't start to strong but ease into it. Then when she does start to date you then have a dinner date with rose and stuffed animal. It will mean more to her at this point.     I know when I was still dating I hated V-day because it was so generic. Get flowers, maybe a stuffed animal, go to a movie, or go out to eat.

And after checking your 'bats' problem I found that the Hebrew word used for bats is sometimes translated 'bird' but is really the more generic 'flying things' (this includes some insects).  The flaw therefore is in your translation and your presuppositions.  The main truth is this, there is more evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ than for any other personal event in ancient history.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	i disagree it does no such thing    as was already pointed out on another same asked question|`|XN0cYCATaa	The Only Flaw is your Understanding of it, THAT is very Obvious.  Attempting to Point out Flaws in the Bible FAIL  Please try again|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	It should be clear, flawless and with no doubt as to meaning or interpretation.    If God wants us to know his Word then I would have thought he would make sure that his book was 100% accurate and that no errors or mistranslations had occurred.    Unfortunately this isn't the case, and therefore I cannot believe the Bible is the Word of God.    It is too flawed and contradictory to be anything other than the writings and thoughts of the priests and holy men of the day.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) if the bible is the true word of god, then it should be flawless shouldn't it?    Well - yes, but the language you use is vague.  IF the bible is the 100% accurate and 100% precise word of God, then it should be flawless.  The bible as a whole can still be the "true" word of God but, if not 100% accurate and precise, it is not **100%** the true word of God (maybe only 99.5% is the true word of God)      2) describing bats as birds    This is a two-pronged problem.  One "prong" is your insistence on using a modern zoological definition of the word "bird" - one, quite obviously, not in use historically.  The other "prong" is the desire for bible translators for conciseness.  A truly precise translation of the Hebrew word - one that includes all of its meanings in that passage - would be "flight-capable animals".  As you can see for yourself, this is NOT the same as "birds".  However, "birds" IS the closest single English word to the phrase "flight capable animals".  It also sounds better. IF the bible were translated with the goal of a truly precise and inclusive translation, it would probably be 3-4 times longer than it is now.  BUT, you have a point:  someone really SHOULD produce a wordy, precise translation of the bible.    Understand, though, that it is not a mistake or error.  It is an intentional translation that trades precision for conciseness.  It is still an *accurate* translation, but it is not a 100% *precise* translation.      3) doesn't this mistake open the door to other possible flaws, or even the possibility that the entire bible is flawed.    Well, only in the sense that, since translation cannot convey the meaning of the original language with 100% accuracy, the bible is not a 100% accurate and precise representation of the word of God - just as close as we have that we are also able to read.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews. com|`|cl4wdRnvaa	Yes. It is full of flaws.|`|cHx0sdElaa	If GOD said that a bat is a bird, then I'll believe that a bat is a bird and everyone else is wrong in their understanding of a bat.    If a man who wrote the bible called a bat a bird, then he is entitled to that flaw.  What man is perfect?

What must be remembered is that believers don't require evidence or corroboration, they just believe, so any internal contradictions or factual errors can simple be ignored.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO...this is a logic and a language error.    First of all you have to know what is being taught and how to interpret before you have anything upon which to place the verdict of 'true/false'  Surprising as it is to you, many things in the Bible are open to opinion and deal with non-essentials, things that don't impinge on what makes you a follower of Jesus to begin with, "the Faith handed down from the Apostles."    As to the bats and birds thing, that is perfectly described in the Hebrew. They used those words and knew what they meant by it, exactly. The problem is English. Would you say that you are wrong when you tell someone to eat their vegetables but they are scientifically known as 'fruit'.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	That's throwing the baby out with the bath water.

2XQstX3xaa	No matter what you'll still be normal and the same old son they've always known and loved. 70% is pretty good, it seems like you're ready to share who you really are with them. Parents can take more then we give them credit for. It would be good to tell them at the same time but if that's not possible maybe after telling your mother and talking with her about it you'll be more calm when you talk to your dad.  It is hard but once you get started and don't turn back it'll get easier and easier. All young gay people have an inner strength that we all need to live in the world that we do, you have it too, you just have to find it and put it to work for you. After the weight has been lifted you'll feel even stronger for whatever life has to bring. You CAN do it, I know you can. And we'll all be there with you.

Even though they might not like it at first, they will love you unconditionally and they will get over it eventually. You never know they might automatically accept it too. Good Luck and you will still have friends on here.|`|WDbE5gffaa	Is it an appropriate time to tell them?  You know them better than any of us, and sorry i haven't read many of your past questions so i'm not sure what you've been saying before. But you can predict better than any of us how they'll react. If you think its possible they'll be very drastic, make sure this is a time you have somewhere to go, someone to lean on if needed. It can be a very hard time for some people...I was blessed with a very easy outing to my parents. A friend of a friend got disowned when he told his parents, luckily by that time he'd moved out with his boyfriend anyway.   And yes, its is going to be hard. I told my mum and dad when they were sat at the table. Just said 'Something i need to tell you about', paused, then just....said it. They went a bit quiet, asked 'what make me think that?' I replied 'I just know.' And ran away. Hugged my best friend for about 10 minutes, then went on a very long walk. My dad tried to call me, and i rejected it once. But i got a very nice acceptance when i did pick up.   I'm sure you've been mulling over this for a while, and it sounds like you're sure you want to do it. Yes, its going to be hard and take alot of will power. But you'll be all the better after wards. Trust me, its a good feeling to have the weight off your shoulders.|`|61c8oevtaa	Good luck!

There is no set plan for "coming out" and each person has a different story to tell. If to-night, the words just seem to stick in your throat, or it just doesn't seem like the "right" time to do it, then do not beat yourself up over it, nothing goes to plan.

I hope you the best of luck and hopes if you do decide to tell them. We're here, and will always be here for you if you need someone. :)|`|RfGiuZ15aa	The first thing to realise is that they probably have an idea about your sexuality anyway. I never told my father because when I was a kid I heard him make derogatory comments about gays. That stuck with me so I was worried about his likely reaction to having a gay son. Sadly, dad died of cancer before I ever got the chance to tell him. However, I told my mother. At the time I had broken up with my boyfriend and she wondered why he didn't come around anymore. I gave a non-committal excuse but didn't feel good about that. Then one day she asked again and I just sat down and told her.     Her response was, "Well, it's not what I would have hoped for you but so long as you're happy then so am I." That was years ago and I am still over the moon about it. Mam told me later that she'd had a feeling about it for some time anyway. So there you go. Mothers always know what their sons are up to.    Shortly before I told my mother, I came out to my eldest sister who is married with 4 children. I was worried about what the children might think. Her response was amazing. "Oh, they already know. I told them ages ago." To this day I've never figured out how she knew even before I told her.    So don't be worried about telling your parents. I'm sure it will be fine and you'll be glad you told them. They love you and they want you to be happy. When you tell them, make sure you reassure them that you are comfortable with your sexuality and that you are happy.    I hope this helps. My very best wishes.|`|hy5la80Baa	i know how it feels just 3 moths ago i was in  your shoes if you need some one im here to talk Any time my email is alonzohamlett@yahoo.com im with you and it will hurt so brase yourself|`|UdsG8v0naa	just tell them already  quit whining about it   you must like a lot of attention on here

Ask him about his likes and dislikes, listen to what he has to say and think about what he is saying, not the next thing you want to say. If you are listening you will think of a folllow-up question naturally, such as where did you go?, when did you do that? how long ago was that, why do you like that?, that's interesting what about.....?|`|Jv1dMGuWaa	Well, most people flirt, like the first person said, awkwardly. But flirting is mostly about body language, it's the speech that's awkward. So don't flirt with speech:<br>  When he's working on a drawing, say, "That's really nice." And brush up behind him, looking over his shoulder.<br>  Try to act shy, and he'll get the point. Joke around with him, and then shyly look at the ground with a small smile.<br>  Bump into a lot when you are walking. <br>  Walk with him to class.<br>  Most of all, be friends with him!

7nO4pgIiaa	The Brights attempt at re-branding atheists use the term "supers" (as in supernatural) to refer to theists.  So the naturalist/supernaturalist split might be acceptable.    However, while it is generally assumed, is it actually the case that all atheist are naturalists?  No, it is not.  The naturalist thus becomes just a subset within atheism and the atheist label still obtains.     While I personally have no qualms with being called an atheist, I understand that the negative connotations it has acquired turn some off (namely the self described agnostics).    I have considered a new name for atheists, specifically those of us who attempt to tackle theism with a critical,rational approach.

But I can't think of a better one. Atheism is just that: a lack of belief in the stuff they made up.

If people ask me what I believe in, I usually say I'm a Humanist. Then after that they usually ask "Yeah, but I mean: about God?". That means: it's them forcing us to use the atheist label.

What defines who I am are my actions -- the way I take care of my family, the way I treat others, the things I love.

RA has a point, though.    Naturalists would account for the science-based aspect of atheism, but would not account for the lack of relationship to any type of religion, hence "atheist".  I think that would effectively bar all y'all from R&S, and I would actually miss that, as the "atheist" definition includes religion and spirituality to a point.    So yes, the name change could be a good idea, but no, going to "naturalist" probably wouldn't pass a vote even in the atheist community, imho.    (btw, I have no problem being called a "super-naturalist", though . . . lol)    --EDIT-- science chick's fiance is also an interesting point . . .

If you think Naturalist more appealing, or just a fuzzier and softer re-branding, do so.    If it is any consolation those of us who consider ourselves "christian" have the same labeling issue - since the word seems to mean many different things to many different people and has nothing to do with the process of how we arrived at our christianity or how we deal with the world as individuals.

e28543bc8f9e3532ab7fa357d27ab64caa	Once my husband had to be checked into the hospital.He was having problems due to his father having terminal cancer,He also had no job and I was working full time but we were barley getting by.Living pay check to paycheck.When he left I was left alone with a small child having to look for someone to care for him while I worked.I had no money and was desperate,I got up one day and just started looking through a drawer thinking to myself I wish I could find some money in here.I do not know why I did that knowing I did not have any money but as I was looking I found a bank envelope opened it and inside this envelope there was $90.Where that $90 came from is a miracle.|`|n9PUzlhzaa	Once I need money urgently.

Automatically he has a 5% chance of surviving.  I called friends, family members, and even ex-girlfriends and asked them to pray for him.  My father asked for one last biopsy before they took his throat out and stretched his stomach.  There were no signs of cancer.  2.  My step-mother had cancer throughout her ovaries.  There was so much internal bleeding that they were having troubles seeing where the cancer had spread to.  She prayed that it wouldn't hit any of her major organs.  The doctors knew that it had spread all over her hip (you could physically feel it just by touching her hip).  They found that it was a rare and aggressive cancer.  When she went under the knife, they found that all of the cancer cells had just missed her major organs.   But the chemo only stopped the cancer from growing.  It didn't get rid of it at all.   They stepped up her chemo.  We all prayed together with friends and family.  Then the doctors stopped chemo a week later.  They said that she would probably die if she had more chemo without a break.  They gave her a blood test and found no cancer cells in her blood.  Then they did a biopsy a couple weeks later and found that the cancer had gone into complete remission.  Hmmm.  Too bad the chemo probably took 10 to 20 years off of her life.|`|oVrcJwphaa	I've experienced small little miracles, on a grander scale such as the two mentioned previously, no but I believe they do exist and hope to experience such one day.

Thankfully, few of us ever get to the point of life or death. However, I imagine that when you are near your last breathe ( not due to fatal illness) you will do just about anything to anyone to survive. I don't believe this is a sane choice, just one to survive. That being the case, that extreme situation would or could be dangerous to anyone who might be in your way of survival or who could actually offer you the hope of survival|`|8c0d15366f972f0fe93e20c73c8bda50aa	The will to survive is dangerous for everyone because people's ideas on "what is needed for survival" differs greatly. Some feel that they need guns and ammo, others food and water, others feel they need shelter and territory as well as others needing power. People confuse the "will to survive" with power almost all of the time. I think it may be because when they are placed in a situation that calls for extreme measures, fighting to be "top dog" is the only priority because once you have that power, you can do whatever to whomever. The will to survive doesn't necessarily have to be dangerous, but as I've mentioned above, there are many differing ideas of what survival is.

4OjLMQ6Yaa	Hmmm not a Christian but here is my two cents. You can only give what you have and are willing to part with. If your in a position where you have only a little and cannot part with it, I would think that your deity would be ok with. If you are living beyond your needs however (and honestly, we humans have a hard time deciphering what is a need and what is a want) I can see it causing issue.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no......everyone isnt rich...|`|JoVbT4noaa	Yep.|`|KT7cllsLaa	No..it is not  You (one) needs to be stronger, to help others  If you ruin your self, you are of no use..to your family, nor others|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	Sadly,  I watched many Christians attend church without their spouse, go to weekly prayer meetings/bible studies and miss their childrens sports activities and jump whenever somebody needed prayer while their families fell apart ... don't make this mistake.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	Luke 14 v 26 is pretty clear cut on this, which is probably what the above answer is referring to: "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters yes, even his own life he cannot be my disciple."    The modern notion, which seems common amongst Christians around the world, that our duty to our family comes first (usually followed by our duty to our nation) is utterly unbiblical. It represents a betrayal of the gospel. In less dramatic language, the principle of Luke 14 is there throughout the Bible, from Abram leaving his own extended family in response to God's call, to Jesus calling his disciples away from the family business, to Paul surrendering the right to a family altogether.    Edit for Sovereign: the passage you are quoting from is a wider one about not leaving people unprovided for; what it is speaking against is a selfish life where, if you like, a person claims to be a believer but spends their money on 'me', while neglecting their immediate family. I think to try and present it as a counter to Jesus' teaching is misleading. Jesus is absolutely clear, that God's Kingdom comes first. Your passage is also primarily about financial provision, whereas the Asker was asking about help or service in a broader sense, as I understand it. Sadly, the issue that you're identifying is also a common one in today's church, so it's useful that you mention the passage.|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	This is what the bible says:    Proverbs 13:22?A good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children, but a sinner's wealth is stored up for the righteous.    1 Timothy 5:8?If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.|`|a62b895e23928e2555a83a605626c900aa	No, it's not wrong.

If that term means helping other JWs to open their eyes and see the organization for what is, which is a controlling, domineering, creepsquad, then I think you are wasting your time.  The active members are blind and don't want your help.  Sadly, that may only result in you turning in to an anti-creep creep and you don't want that.  But if by "helping others" you mean volunteering at a hospital 3x per week (just as an example), but you really need to spend that time working to earn money, then you need to put your family first in all things and not feel guilty about it.  Our Father in heaven has made it completely clear in the scriptures that we are to care for our families.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	I totally agree with westerner1959.  Remember God set His Holy Spirit in you to guide you.  Follow your heart in all things.  If God is putting someone on your heart to help, then help that person.  If God is putting on your heart that you should stop doing so much for others and focus on your family more, than you should do that.  No you're never wrong to do what you feel is right if your truly following the Lord.  God bless you, brother.|`|a9rVonHJaa	Yes.

Galatians 6:10 -- Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.    So, it's not a matter of stopping doing for others, it's a matter of priority -- First your family, then your brethren in the faith, then you community at large.  .|`|Hp2DKNH5aa	God gave you a family to take care of.

SPQdFOwKaa	I don't think there's actually a "best place." You might go to college with people just like you and hate their guts. You might find uneducated people at a pub and turn out to know them for the rest of your life. But great and true friends aren't to be sought and picked out of a crowd. The truest and greatest friends usually come when you never expect them. Or they might not ever come.|`|i48kxrbaaa	Personally, at school(college). I have more in common with them, and they're in my age group. Co-workers remain just that.|`|qbb9YiRsaa	I would say that college is the best place.  In most instances, when you meet people in college, you meet them in the dormitories, spend time with them, live with them.  I met my best friends in college who, after 7 years, are still my family.    I find that friends from the workforce are second because you spend so much time with them and fine things that you have in common.    The pubs are always so noisy, people are drunk...IMO not a good place to meet friends|`|4HClQObFaa	No question that college is the best place. The people you meet there can and do spend more time with you and you get to know each other better.    People you meet in pubs rarely allow their deepest feelings out so you don't get to know them well.    People at work are even more uptight. They are ven less likely to let you see what makes them tick.    And I am still friends with a dozen or more of my college friends but with very few people I've met at work and only with a single one of my friends at school. And, by the way I'm 74!|`|GqfiRXu3aa	You can make friends at college, work, and bars.  I have a friend I worked with 12 years ago with whom I still keep in contact.

There are good and bad people everywhere, it's just a matter of finding people who click with  you.  You never know when you meet someone -- he/she could become a lifelong friend.

He likely was married because his religion teaches that it is a sin to be homosexual and that you need to try to rid yourself of this lifestyle. Also, sexuality is often on a continuum..it IS possible to be attracted to men and women (bisexuality) and to have varying degrees of the same.  It's often the people that are homosexual secretly that speak out against it so vehemently, I have found, because they seem to be operating from a place of self-loathing at the time. It's quite sad.  I think he's very brave to come forward and admit this. How many conservative, Evangelical leaders could do that?   As for how they stay married, that is their business. Some couples do.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	That is why Jesus told everyone "don't call anyone father but your father in heaven."  I could NEVER call a priest father, he is NOT my father.

She said something about not caring about the nature of the problem - his path of choice was what would determine what sort of man he was.

2TGSjrxPaa	What sects? What are you on about?    I like how people quote their hadith which say nothing about being shia and Sunni and when it comes to Quran clear as day and simple as 1 + 1, they run away and they ignore the truth that Allah has made plain to us.    Keep to your hadith wars but Allah will ask you why you ignored the Quran when He tells you:      The Noble Qur'an 3:103, 105    And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Qur'an), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allah's Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islamic Faith), and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allah makes His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.,) clear to you, that you may be guided.    ...And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.      What room is there for argument when there is this undenyable truth in front of you. One must ask, who is then running from the truth. Shia? Sunni? I say both.    Allah has united us under one creed, he has left for us the ways of the Prophet (saw) so that things could be easier on us, so that we would have less discrepencies and so that we would know our duties as Muslims from the best source. How can we fight with such a blessing? How can we tarnish the ways of Muhammad by dividing, changing and injecting Bidah into this beautiful perfect religion. Shame on us all.

(Quran 5:3)    Some of Sunni references which mentioned the revelation of the above  verse of Quran in Ghadir Khum after the speech of the Prophet:    (1) al-Durr al-Manthur, by al-Hafiz Jalaluddin al-Suyuti, v3, p19  (2) Tarikh, by Khatib al-Baghdadi, v8, pp 290,596 from Abu Hurayra  (3) Manaqaib, by Ibn Maghazali, p19  (4) History of Damascus, Ibn Asakir, v2, p75  (5) al-Itqan, by al-Suyuti, v1, p13  (6) Manaqib, by Khawarazmi al-Hanfi, p80  (7) al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah, by Ibn Kathir, v3, p213  (8) Yanabi al-Mawaddah, by al-Qudoozi al-Hanafi, p115  (9) Nuzul al-Quran, by al-Hafiz Abu Nuaym narrated on the authority  Abu Said Khudri.   and more.    The above verse clearly indicates that Islam without clearing up the matter of leadership after Prophet was not completed, and the completion of religion was due to announcement of Prophets immediate successor.    After his speech, the Messenger of Allah asked everybody to give the oath of allegiance to Ali (AS) and congratulate him. Among those who gave him the oath were Umar, Abu Bakr, and Uthman. It is narrated that Umar and Abu Bakr said:    Well done Ibn Abi Talib! Today you became the leader (Mawla) of all  believing men and women.

HBK9aIhxaa	Terra Pacis  Terra Gaudii    added note: the following answer would be correct regarding the use of genitive case, except that the main noun would go first, the genitive noun second, because it is descriptive genitive, not possessive genitive - eg. Lacus Gaudii (latin for "Lake of Delight") is a small lunar mare in the Terra Nivium (latin for "Land of Snows") region of the Moon.|`|RDWzGxb7aa	Terra pacis. maybe, my Latin isn't so hot.|`|kidXtmYgaa	Both previous answers are quite right.. but remember!  Latin prefers to put the genitive before the nouns so it is:  -Pacis terra.  -Gaudii terra ("gaudium" is just the base form, not the genitive)

It doesn't single out<br>  Africa for special treatment because the same factors also<br>  apply to a variety of other regions.|`|128dabda8f0778ce2ae141936e4f22f8aa	Great question but also an unnecessary one. To have an MA in political science I realize that you are most likely an intelligent person and most likely already knows that the Ancient Egyptian Civilization was located on the African continent, along with other Ancient African civilizations. Africa's fall of grace can be blamed on many things: *Negative European presence (Colonialism) *Rampant Corruption *Rampant Poverty *Poor Medical Care *Poor Infrastructure *Low levels of education *Brain Drain (People who get educated in Africa leave for Europe, the US, or the UAE to make more $$$$) And I could go on and on and on. But to really understand this you have to go to Africa (I've been) and explore it more deeply, Africa is too often considered one entity. There are countries their that are showing significant signs of improvement and others that have, in the past, reared the greatest civilization know to man, (Egypt)  It is a huge continent with countries trying to reemerge as productive countries, ex: Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria. It will take time, education, and $$$ to get some African countries on the level that the USA is on, but on that same note, 1/2 of all the people in the world live below poverty, so Africa isn't the only place in the world showing little significant progress in the world.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	I had a professor that specialized in African studies, having grown up there, and his analysis was this: For hundreds of years, Africa had a resource that everyone wanted / needed...slaves! There was no need to develop past a primitive trade society, as the trade in people was already in use in Africa anyway. The tribes there practiced it on each other, and it was other countries that brought the trade to the rest of the world. Since the banning of slavery, they've been playing catch-up with the rest of the modern world, and as a result of corruption and other problems, are still very far behind.|`|AA11142889	You haven't studied much history, have you?

I think this is a common sense type question that people are afraid of being called racist or a bigot to really answer which is funny since the answer obviously involves race.  Beagles and pit bulls are both dogs but don't exactly have the same demeanor.  Both animals exist on this planet together and I bet would even breed with each other if given the chance :P|`|ymDt0AfHaa	I am only 15m, so my answer may not count for much, but I think that there is so "little" progress in Africa because in the African culture, they seem to like to keep things simple and to live off the land and to have a working community in which is built on skill and culture. These are only personal thoughts that are pulled out of a very sympathetic and sensitive teenager. (and for the record, I don't think that Africa is slow on modern activity, I think they simply choose not to follow or worldly ways and they are indeed smart in agriculture and architecture)|`|vMJV1Jf0aa	The answer is simple and 'racist' ; low IQ.<br>  <br>   The truth will set you free.The truth is racist.

61c8oevtaa	My fist gay kiss was with a straight guy (or so he says) who swore me to secrecy afterwards because he was so ashamed. I still haven't told anyone except people online. It's a nice story though:    Something bad happened (I won't go into detail) and I was really upset. I went up to the darkroom in the art department at school (for developing photos). It's warm and dark in there and no one ever comes in. I just sat there and cried. He knew I would be there so he came up to comfort me and yeah... it just kind of progressed from there lol. There's a lock on the door and you can light up a sign outside that says not to come in because you're developing photos (the light spoils them).    *sigh* such a romantic moment. Shame I can never tell my friends about it...     =]|`|qbb9YiRsaa	the first true gay kiss i had (with someone other than my drunk roommate, i don't really count it) involved making out for oh...4 hours and dry humping on the ground.  It was exciting :P    Later that week we had sex, it was my first.  Not a great experience, he laughed at me at times (in a "oh you're sweet" kind of way but still kind of insulting).    So, first kiss pretty good, first sex not so much.    BTW your darkroom story above is amazing lol|`|sRoRsrjQaa	my first was with a guy 15 year older than me. we went to his bedroom, make out, clothing comes off, and he took the lead.

One week later we met again and  spent the whole night just talking until the bar closed and kicked us out, so we were walking around downtown and she just kissed me. I remember I was so scared of people seeing us but I was also so happy because it just felt right.   Our first time having sex was about a month after that and that was even more terrifying because I didn't know what to do or how to act, so I didn't really do anything...she took over. After I was kinda embarrassed and shy but she was so sweet to me and now we have been together for 6 months.|`|2ywzcoVqaa	My first time with a girl was a learning experience.

kZTx2Phhaa	How much is too much? - More than you can afford and more than you can accommodate in your home!<br>  <br>  Suggest you buy her <br>  - one large item ( a teepee to use outside or play kitchen or play house) that she is likely to use over the next few years & which you can pass onto someone else when she has finished playing with it or sell on<br>  - one christmas item - a bauble or something to represent her second year which she can add to each christmas until she is an adult.<br>  - 2 or 3 smaller items  like a truck, doll, outfit  or lego kit, or something for her room<br>  - a stocking full of little things that she can play with  like play dough, paints, brushes, hair bands, stickers etc. which aren't necessarily going to stay with you for ever.  Go mad on this one - not the big things.<br>  <br>  Children remember the love and attention and christmas spirit, as well as the glitter and the presents, so even what I have suggested is more than ample (but still generous) for a parent to give to their child.  Get her involved in making the christmas cookies, cake or pudding, the decorations etc. - this will provide her with as much excitement as any present.<br>  <br>  It is difficult to restrain yourself from buying too much for your own children though, so I wish you luck in limiting it this year!|`|8x4ODYuyaa	I think that i agree with the person who suggested the different items such as one large item and stocking fillers etc<br>  <br>  If you get her a large item such as a play kitchen or whatever, this will probably be the focus of her attention. The other smaller items you can wrap up and put them into a large stocking such as dvd's, books, smaller toys (dolls, games, cuddly toys, etc) and sweets/chocolate. I find that the best part of Christmas is just the whole thing in general, not just the presents. The preperation for Christmas day and the parties and the atmosphere is the best. <br>  <br>  I also agree that you should set yourself a round about budget. If you go way over this budget you know that you have spent too much and should maybe consider saving some of the presents for her birthday. You want to try to avoid spoiling her as hard as it is, because i was spoiled as a child and as a result of that i take a lot of things for granted. You don't want your daughter doing the same trust me.<br>  <br>  Whatever you get her though im sure she will appriciate and love.<br>  =]|`|7F5LhhUAaa	even though she is your only child and you want her to have the best of everything- sometimes too much can hurt your child in the long run. she is too little now to know this anyway- but when she gets older don't you want her to value the items she has and work to get them? if you just give give give she will expect nothing less and turn into a little brat (sorry to say, but I see kids everywhere that are spoiled rotten and turn out to be terrible to their parents and family because they don't do anything and get everything they want cuz they throw a fit)<br>  I would set a $ limit, and only get her the big items you know she really wants- family will get her tons of smaller items I'm sure. how about a bunch of books to get her to start to love reading instead of always playing with toys and video games later.<br>  Just my opinion!|`|A7GyXCI7aa	You can NEVER buy too much for a child at Christmas.....................<br>  <br>  Spoil your child rotten.

For a child to learn, and then be sincerely unselfish is the greatest gift they can receive, especially in a selfish world.   Everything that Christ teaches is unselfishness only, with no slightest spot of selfishness in it.   So for a child to learn to be unselfish, again, is a great gift.   As for material possessions, Christ tells us to beware of selfish desires; for a person′s life does not consist in the abundance of things they possess.<br>  (Matthew.25:31-46)<br>  (Luke.12:15)<br>  (Acts.20:35)<br>  (I John.3:17)<br>

RDWzGxb7aa	No, what is wrong with America, and that which makes it look terrible in the eyes of the world, is the materialist culture. It is not poor people who make the country you love so much look bad, it is people who would rather everyone else sorted out their act without wondering what is wrong with them. Now I don't know you, you may have had difficult beginnings, the reason they are difficult beginnings is because it is difficult to raise yourself out of poverty when a good education ultimately costs thousands of dollars if not more. The Revolution may have ridden America of the Aristocray, but let us not pretend for a moment that the U.S is not ruled by the super rich, e.g. lobbyists. Look at how rich presidents and senators are, and more importantly, were before they got the job, look at who they know, what universities they went to and ask yourself if that is what you want to love.    Love the people of your country more than the land, wish them happiness and help, why should people brush up if they have nothing to be proud of?|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Honey, welcome to the real world, this is not Utopia nor will it ever be ideal, so instead of reacting with anger, which is a waste of time and emotion, just accept the fact that the world is comprised of everyone and everything and you will never find the perfect place with perfect people and perfection everywhere because life is not always perfect, just the way it is.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	You're a snob.

I think you need to let them know that recent changes in management have made you leave as the HR department will pass this info on to higher management who can then do something about the new manager or at least keep an eye on things with him and other members of staff.<br>  New management always leads to a turn over of staff especially long term staff who are used to the old way. By making them aware of the fact you felt he is making the job uncomfortable for you will look at other staff resignations differently. They can provide him training to improve his management skills. So he won't have won instead he will be under the watch-full eye of higher management. <br>  Don't worry about a reference as they can't give a bad one, all they can give is your attendance and whether you completed your work. these things tend to be kept on file.

In which case, it's up to you if you want the threesome.<br>  <br>  Or maybe you just don't want him annoying/teasing you about your sexuality. In which case, nanny-nanny-boo-boo, you're queer and I am too. ;P Any SEXY GIRLS you like?<br>  <br>  Just kidding. Unless your real problem is, are you afraid he'll out you and tell everyone you're bi. In which case, yes, be afraid.

bLahP9Ivaa	I would say the best place to learn Polish would be Poland. You don't mention where you are from or how far you are willing to travel. Yes, free is good, but you will probably not find a school who teaches Polish for free.

i8yanqUAaa	Strangely there exist enough people who can't understand your thoughts.  They just can't see or maybe don't care that those people who are rich, are rich because of egoism.  This world is wrapped up in a system, this system requires a large amount of hard working people, a large amount of lower-class and lower middle-class people to have those high-class (rich) people on top.  With this said, it's in no way true that if you study,work hard (simply put:sacrifice your whole life for work) you'll automatically get rich or at least a decent living.  Simply not true, another example: Many of those rich people actually inherited their wealth(they didn't work hard or didn't work at all).    This is even true on a global level: Think about First and third world countries.  Now don't you tell me, third world countries are poor because of their people being lazy or evil (that's really a too simple minded line of thought),it's because first world countries own all the important things (which in turn is rooted in historical periods like colonialism).    So, I see your point, and I agree, rich people should not waste money like that,....they should better try to help the poor people of this world if they have a heart.  There are just far enough people on this world who have got no love for the human race.|`|C2S3guXMaa	I hear your question. I understand that you find it offensive. I'm not rich so I'm not in a position to answer your question. There have been years in my life when I had almost no money & wrapped myself up in coats & towels to keep warm (couldn't afford a duvet).     However, never through those years did I ever once even consider giving my cat anything but good food & the best of care and attention. My cat always came first. I would feed her before myself. I would spend my last few coins on her so that she would be happy & healthy.     Do you know that neglecting a pet is a type of animal cruelty & is illegal? With your lack of money there can't be much in the way of leftovers. Your dog must be very hungry. Your reply to nic indicates that you don't have much love & respect for your dog. Why do you even have a dog if you don't care about him? I repeat, giving a pet insufficient food is animal neglect and that is seen by the RSPCA/ASPCA/SSPCA as cruelty and is illegal. You could be prosecuted, fined & your dog would be taken away.|`|TKDi70uTaa	dont worry what others do it will make you bitter. just concentrate on improving your own situation. i have had ups and downs all my life but i find if you dont give up and refuse to accept a bad situation things do get better.|`|cumhOqjXaa	Wow. I feel so sorry for you. I know the rich ppl do intend doing this alot, but what can we do? Nothing its their decisions sure that money would help.  Good Luck with everything.  =]|`|VPC8Epq9aa	Your on yahoo?  that means you must own a laptop/computer.    by Africa's standards your bloody loaded.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Stop being such a green eyed monster!  YOU WOULD DO THE SAME if you had the money!    I do not feel they should stop splurging just because you or I are poor.  YOU OBVIOUSLY have internet!... and IF THEY USE UP all their money or their investments fail  then they too will feel the pinch (the hard way... and they won't know how to do it like we do from practice)    THEN are you going to throw it up in their face???  SSympathy empathy!    I know of families who are now living in a RV park because of ENRON!    you might think about the way you feel.. you know KARMA will return and bite you...|`|NeTNnvSZaa	If you can stay home and be on-line then I bet you can get a job working from home too?  Every try Avon, Medical billing specialist, or anything like that?    Sitting home complaining about things you can't do anything about is just going to make you a bitter person.      Why do you ask how people feel then get "disillusioned" when they don't agree with you?|`|xnsU60hhaa	It is absolutely none of your business what other people do with their money whether they are rich or poor. But since it irritates you, it looks like you have a personal problem to work on.|`|AA10067344	I feel that rich people dumping excessive amounts of money into the economy isn't as bad as you think it is.|`|3qLIRorjaa	Jealousy is a bad trait. Most people earn money - if you don't like the way you live then change it.    And to only feed your dog "leftovers" is a disgrace!|`|qxteTM9Kaa	All waste is wrong.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Okay. Not ALL rich people spend money on some junk, and such. And l understand that rich people don't need to bother to recycle everything like poor people do. But seriously, you're getting the wrong idea, your offending US! We work, too. And half of us have to take care of each other for a matter of fact. So stop complaining and get on with your life.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	I remember feeling like a Rockerfeller when visiting some third world countries. Then feeling like a beggar compared to the guys that ran a company I worked for that were paid quarterly bonus' greater than my annual salary. It's all relative. Don't be upset because they have the money and you don't, you'll just make yourself nuts, just make the best of things...|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	You are just hanging around the wrong people.

Just don't let them come running to you when their world caves in.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	i know more middle class people that don't do a darned thing for the poor, while the rich are usually very good at donating.    i think that clothing for cement porch geese is wasteful. how about the fact that most people have a cable and cell phone bill that combined rival a mortgage payment.... when the "poor" start taking care of their own affaris they can worry about others.    all people are wasteful -- i see it from the "poor" who scoff when panhandling at a meal because they really want "cash" and not "will work for food" to the rich who are as wasteful as you claim.    I'm contradicting you absolutely  ; )  but only to have you open your eyes to the fact - it's the poor and middle class that are just as wasteful!!!|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Eat the rich!|`|N8rDV4FGaa	I think you should get a job.|`|6aaCfPJiaa	why dont you get a job thats how the rest of us survive and a decent education!!!|`|7TyttsPTaa	They achieved it through Life... they worked hard for it..

They have judged you with out any knowledge of your back ground. Hey! It's the American way. My question back would be. Do you think they really care?|`|77ZVd5hyaa	Sounds like a personnel problem to me.|`|wzGSdBHsaa	You can't be that bad you can obviously afford a computer and to pay your internet bills every month. So sell the computer and stop whingeing to us all about how hard done to you are.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	I am sorry for you and wholeheartedly agree with your point of view. However, the majority of the wealthy are very careful individuals and "save their pennies". The number of people who are suffering considerable financial hardship is increasing daily and there may be thousands of homeless people by the end of this year.|`|ZImavV2Oaa	i cant believe people who do nothing and get inheritances have the nerve to tell other people to get a job.      i respect people like donald trump who worked for it, but people like paris hilton who do nothing but spread their legs and contribute nothing to society are a waste of sperm.|`|hvsmr1QVaa	Dog food is cheaper and much better for your dog. The money that you will spend on vet bills for your sick pooch would be better spent on a nice living room rug.  Jealousy is a horrible trait. Spend more time thinking about the good things YOU have and less worrying about what someone else has...and eat your own leftovers instead of giving them to the poor dog.|`|7Tq7EbFnaa	Do you realise how offensive you sound. Stop and think, most rich people (and i am most definitely NOT rich! got lots of friends who are tho) have worked  long  and hard for what they've got and are entitled to do what they want with it, take stock of yourself, from where i'm standing being offended doesn't come into it, i do see a little green eyed monster tho! if YOU want to be rich scour the job centres instead of the pavements, then you'll be able to open a bank account and look after your pennies, give you and your dog a better life and turn up your central heating. its no fun living on benefits (i know that) but no-one has the right to dictate how other people choose to live their lives or spend they money (we don't live in China!)|`|LYO0Y8lHaa	im not rich but most rich people worked there way to be rich which is fare enough and if they are going to waste there money that they might need if they end up going bankrupt then thats their fault but if its rich people that didnt earn there way like pairs hilton then yeah she pisses me off. but i really dont see how this bothers you so much.

As you say, you aren't complaining -- so what difference does it make to you what someone else does with their money?    If you weren't envious, you'd probably just shake your head and go "wow, must be nice," forget it and go on.  Instead, you posted a long rant on the subject about how you aren't jealous, but then carefully compared your situation to theirs. It's ok to be envious.  But it is a waste of emotional energy.|`|AA11788494	Yes I understand what you are saying.  I don't think people need to go in debt to get a fancy car but if that is what they think is necessary then let them go for it.  You only live once.  What I think is a shame is seeing rich people give to charities out of the country when their own country suffers.  However again, it is their choice.|`|ai33g11Maa	I am lucky enough not to have such moronic friends, so I don't ever have the problem.      I am not rich of pocket, but I am rich of mind.

They work hard to in college/uni to get a good job or they work hard to set up a good buisness.  Its all hard work off thier own back why the hell should they feel guilty to enjoy it.

Sorry.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	Bring your wife back. There are two answers.    1. If you wife died, then no, we will not find anyone who can resurrect her for you. We can look for a medium to let you speak with her a bit. The resurrection thing is only done in ultra extreme circumstances, perhaps once or twice every 2,000 to 3,000 years.    2. If she left you and you want her back, you will have to look inside to find out why she left. Then determine if you can change anything within yourself that you can change to satisfy her demands better. Under no circumstances at all will any self-respcting witch, warlock, wizard, Wiccan, Psychic, or other member of a related belief, do anything to compell another against their will.    If there is a different circumstance that you are asking about, I am sorry I could not see it in your question.|`|1lRlNIelaa	First, learn some spelling!  Second, Witches and such are in no way like Hollywood or fairy tales portray them.  We do not bring the dead back, we do not do any fancy lightning-involved majestic Charmed-like rituals.

The grave which when we die and are placed in is hell or the pit, sheol or hades as it's referred to by the scriptures.    Was what he did wrong. He, you said was depressed and had a love one whom he cherished more than his own life, yet.  still this is not what   God expects of us.  In spiritual matters to forfeit our life on behalf of serving God is different from a state of depression. Being that his knowledge of Almighty God's plan   was not evident to him by his actions he did not realize that what he   was doing was showing reverence for his own life. His mental stability was not the same so can he beheld responsibile for a sickness. The person who recieves his heart has been given life for a while longer but has he gained everlasting life by doing as God ask; taking in knowledge so that you will know God's position on reverence of life only he can give. Taking one's own life is a serious matter of one having Godly respect for life. With the scriptures, one comes to an understanding of God's arrangements and therefore waits on God as being a servant we have been instructed to do so.    The scriptures tell us that "the wages sin pays is death." In his lack of understanding he paid for his sins with his personal death. God is a God of love and said that even the unrighteous would be resurrected by means of Jesus sacrifice if he is in God's memory which God tells us   that he is. He will be bought back to learn the truth and given the opportunity to chose his way and he will be judged by what he does during that period he is resurrected into the thousand year reign of Jesus Christ. Those who have a knowledge of God's word knows that God will   resurrect those who have died in sickness and poor health. Those who have died accidental deaths. Those who have been killed at the hands of murders. Those babys that never had a chance to survive and  learn his way as they grew up. They will be resurrected back to life where family and friends, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers,  will hold them in the earthly paradise Kingdom of God here on earth.   Rest for a little while in sleep until Jesus awakens you from the the hold of Adamic death. Oh death where is thy sting for our King has been given authority by the father to restore all things unto our God and Creator. Death and hell (man's grave) will give up those dead in   them and the sea those dead in it. Thy dead men shall live, their bodies   shall rise. O dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For thy dew is the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead. Isaiah 26; 19    Rev. 20; 11-15 .... those who are not found worthy for their works of  ways during the thousand year reign will die the second death which is an everlasting death of destruction. The living are the ones who need to   check their hand and way of life toward Almighty God for if you die at his hand as some have  in the old testament as he was perserving the lineage and promise of the Christ (seed) their is no resurrection for them because he saw that their heart would never change and therefore they recieved what they had sewn; his "Divine Judgment of death".

But I have worked in a school office and sometimes they do call the doctors office to make sure the excuse is legitimate.|`|bWcJqSSbaa	no there to stupid lol,  i do it all the time|`|rbloxE6paa	course they could, if they thought it wasn't real, which I assume it's not|`|ODR1Woxyaa	they could call the doctors office....thats what my school does
DeuKCARsaa	ANYONE can be amazing with the short game...thats why its a game.     They have spurts of creativity, sensitivity, etc....becasue they dont plan on maintaining it. The guys who plan to maintain it....streach the effort out...especially if they plan to know you for a while.    Think about it....these guys are great at being awesome becasue who and what theyre doing is always NEW.|`|YoHroOcGaa	I can do whtever, untamed and wild|`|9EpMhhtVaa	I was a wild womanizing man.  I always treat the women I have been with with respect but I would get with as many as I could.  I'm 27 now and that life is no longer fun for me, so I think it comes with age and maturity and now I have a 2 year old daughter so I'm trying to settle down with her mom and do the family thing.|`|NsFaPI9waa	You work out men hun, you find the mystery to life
HMteUyRdaa	They are discerning their vocation and by the end some will be priests and other will discern they were not meant for that life.    Pray the Rosary for vocations, receive the Sacraments|`|AA11382947	They are studying to become Priests and Religious?    They tend to be very intelligent, and they are some of the best people I have ever met.      And I know a lot of them, the Catholic Church is having a renewal of young Priests.      Thank God.      God Bless you!|`|8tF9Py9Daa	That they wish to study in order to become priests or ministers.  What else IS there to sy?|`|AA11898755	small hands...very scary...always smell of semen|`|AASxKRiAaa	There are hoping to become priests? they are discerning their vocation...? My brother is one..?|`|n0jeAA3Paa	they are the coolest!   i know a few from various countries and they are so fun to be around!   and i really admire them...they're such good and smart (and gorgeous lol) guys.|`|pTrHHw3Aaa	I think the world of them.  They have answered "yes" to God's call.  The priesthood is not for wimps or the unintelligent.  Studying to be a priest and then having a ministry is extremely difficult work.  God bless them all.      Pray for more vocations.  Not just priests, but religious sisters and brothers.|`|x08WVa6haa	Joseph Stalin was one :)   I can't say anything, it's like asking what I can say about Canadians. There are many of them, and they are all different.
bLahP9Ivaa	I am sorry but your spelling renders this unintelligible...|`|9IrdMFX7aa	Yes, it is Swiss German.    Isch ht s natel klaut worde..voll down.  In normal German this sounds so:  Ist heute das Natel geklaut worden ... voll down.    Translation:  Somebody stole my mobile phone.... I am totally down.|`|t5hp4t79aa	It sounds germanic, but its not german, nor swiss german "they're basically the same thing". 'Down" is an english word and not sure if it is part of the phrase..This might actually be dutch.
lawMUua3aa	im for it|`|kAnmzvnSaa	I think you need to learn the difference between 'allowed' and 'aloud'.|`|Vo6YukG2aa	Allowed?     Duhhhhhhhhhhhh.|`|GkO45d7uaa	I've gotta say no on this one. I'm very traditional.    Here come the thumbs-downs lol.    And I agree with everyone who says you need to learn the difference between "allowed" and "aloud."|`|Scxn4Z1maa	All for it!!!!!|`|HAHDipTAaa	Very loudly shout - Gay marriage is our right!  Heh|`|GqfiRXu3aa	They should not be aloud.  They should be politely quiet.  :-)    But they should be allowed to get married.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	A lot of people think it should be silent, but if they want to say they're married aloud, I'm all for it.|`|WDbE5gffaa	yes|`|i4Vt4YJ4aa	"aloud"??..Yes very allowed...|`|RedEGIfZaa	The 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law to all citizens.  Not allowing same-sex marriage is a blatant violation of the Constitution.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	Yes|`|WkQRC8Bzaa	Yes, better to make gay marriage aloud than to do it silently.|`|hyYWX82Eaa	Well, loud and proud has always been my approach, so why not? ^__^    And, for your real question, yes. I would like the right to marry the woman I love, seems simple enough |`|mJmXtibRaa	Not if you don't know how to spell allowed.|`|FuJQjHmUaa	I vote for it.|`|BScOKVItaa	everybody has the right to be miserable as the next married couple|`|t5hp4t79aa	I'm not gay so it's not my decision. No one has the right to tell an adult who he/she can and can't marry|`|hy5la80Baa	im am strongly for it
AA11382947	If you are sick or home bound, lay people can take holy communion to your home.      Yes.  But it has to be done in a reverent way, and it is not for people to lazy to get up and go to Mass.    Peace be with you.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	it wont be the same....thats for shutins....this ques is INcomplete..|`|qCtbizzPaa	Drinking alone is kind of sad. Then, you're just sitting on your bed, eating crackers.|`|zQyslfHKaa	No, too afraid to lose my reflection in the mirror.|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	If you are speaking of  the Catholic Eucharist it may only be received by the ill(housebound) and/or the dying at home.  God bless.|`|MkQWnA22aa	I'm not sure what you are speaking of, specificially.  If you mean the Roman Catholic sacrament, if you are ill or housebound, then a Minister of the Eucharist or Parish priest can bring you communion at home.
JXH8SDqOaa	It hurts when friends do things that we feel are betrayals.    Well, the good thing is that since they already know, you no longer have to come out to them, and their game is ruined, isn't it?|`|yzQAZMkoaa	oooh well of course i mean u trust your friends but this aint a true friend...|`|2iFQerjraa	No, let life go on and be happy. You live your life your way. There are  other friends you can find around.

kidXtmYgaa	Well, actually I've never found any good translatior in Latin not even in Italian that should be more easy!  'Couse Latin has got lots of different cases that are untranslatable in an automatic way. There are a lot of good dictionary to translate word to word, but is not possible to translate without knowing the base grammar rules. Here on Yahoo several people try to answer using the on-line translators, and they don't help, they just confuse the questioner...and everyone who knows just a lil bit of Latin could expose them!  So an accurate translator doesn't exist.  BTW- if you need sometin you could post your question here, of course smbd who studied Latin could help you!|`|rv2Iy1Y7aa	All foreign language translators are in the beginning to intermediate stage of development right now.  The more complex the structures of a language, it seems, the more difficult it is to make ithe machine translator accurate and dependable.  They are getting better though.  Your best chance at depending on any translator is to learn the language of your choice first; then begin to use the machine of choice.    I don't mean to be flippant; but the brain - properly trained - is still better than any of the electronic translators, online or otherwise.|`|l2xVPse2aa	I might can translate latin and you know i am reliable because i know latin like it is my first laguage (and i spell better in latin than english)     just send me words to interpret and i can give you back answers same day
b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	You may want to write about the real presence at the altar. You may want to talk about how you felt when you were sitting there. Did you pray, read, or meditate. You may want to write about what you felt you learned or experienced when you were there. I hope this helps you out.|`|93galWG1aa	How can anyone tell you how you felt?<br>  If you want to know the meaning of doing this, then it is because we believe it to be Christ Present with us, we adore Christ i the form of the Eucharist.<br>  google some sites on the Eucharistic miracles, Lanciano miracle is very good.............Can you not reflect on what you felt? that,s the point.<br>  |`|Q79HtvJIaa	what does 'it' stand for?<br>  try Gods love.|`|o4o1lM8laa	That doesn't make any sense.<br>  Perhaps you work on your typing skills and then I'll help you.
boSv7SgOaa	the greek myths basically give explanations to the unexplained. for example: Why does the sun rise? reason: the God Helios moves it. Why do we dream? the God Morpheus sends us them.<br>  as we know now these are NOT the real reasons why. But Greek Myths are a great example of how mostly all religion of any time have a god or gods to blame reason on what people can't explain.|`|OM71kA5Faa	The Greek myths reflect the culture of the times because each myth reflects the morals and customs of the people of that era.  Each myth reveals, for example, that the people of the time valued physical strength and beauty.  They also were expected to live virtuous lives, though many did not.  We also learn from these myths that the people enjoyed drinking wine and that customs involving the consumption of wine.  Also, from the heroes in their myths we see what the Greeks saw a noble and ideal.  
Zbn8A7Geaa	I would agree with the above answer with regard to size, power and body odor.  But not speed and agility.  I think women have the upper hand on speed and agility.  Also, men overpower women because men are like bulls in the proverbial china shop.  Their first instinct is to try to do everything with force and unfortunately they often succeed with that technique.|`|OM71kA5Faa	Size, physical strength, speed, agility, body odor|`|qpBDRGsOaa	Only physical strength.<br>  They are insecure when they do overpower women.<br>  they overpower women because women are in fact stronger than a man. -I'm not talking physical strength here. Women are stronger in everything else besides physical strength.<br>  If men will one day put down their egos, they will find that women compliment them and men compliment women. They compliment each other.|`|vN11l8WDaa	yes men do overpower women in size and strength but in speed and agility wise women rule. men become very insecure around women who have power over them and they know that they do. a women could out smart a man any day of the week.

oChOlCqYaa	Christmas is too commercialized - you should hand make them some gifts. Edibles are always nice, or simple jewelry, soaps, candles, just check out the internet for some ideas. I really like www.craftster.org for inspiration.|`|KywDaru8aa	Just a simple card and candy cane or a mug filled with candy (all that stuff is at your local Dollar store) or (i guess euro store?)|`|kZTx2Phhaa	A christmas bauble or star.  These are relatively inexpensive but you can get some really pretty ones, even for a pound, if you look around.  |`|9XXwRmmVaa	How about a nice bracelet each? Do you have a primark where you live? You can get cheap jewelry in their for ￡1.00 and under. 
CrNrqvQFaa	I posted this in another answer, but what I did was write 365 reasons I loved my boyfriend and put it in a box so every morning he could reach in until next Valentine's and read one.    I also used a scrabble board to form words about our relationship and left that on the table.    Some ideas are cutting out paper hearts from construction paper (only a few dollars) and writing reasons you love him on there, making a trail to the bedroom or a dinner or something.    She could also do a scavenger hunt in the house with the same idea.|`|BVuSyz8naa	buy him a rubber vagina|`|X2Mc0FCGaa	Nice candlelight dinner with his favorite meal  Relaxing watching movies and eating popcorn  Coupon book of nice things that he would like to have done occasionally that he can use
