Tom just wants to play, but I have a feeling it is that Tom came in after Tommy and might want to be king of the house, like Tommy is. Tommy always is looking around corners and is never at ease until Tom is outside and Tommy has searched the hour for him. Someone suggested rubbing the whiskers, but it doesn't always work. Please please help. Or do we have to get rid of Tom? Tom is my cat and I love him so much. He and Tommy both are good cats and don't deserve to be given away or sold.

Her feathers are all puffy,that could be due to my mom putting water on her,because she was cleaning the cage.      She's letting my mom touch her,she never did that before.      She puts her head into the food thing,and just stays there.      Is she sick?   My mom just put food into the cage.      We don't have a vet,we take our dog to that ASPCA bus..Oh dear,I wonder what's wrong with her.      My male is sort of the dominant one,he usually eats more then her.

Well, I have a male betta and a female betta in the container with a separator in which they can only see each other and not make contact whatsoever.      From what i've observed, the male betta is always flaring at the female; and the female seems to be attracted to him when he does so. I've also noticed these faint, thick black verticle lines on the females body. Also she has a white dot around her anus. The male hasn't made a bubble nest.      My question is, are they ready to get it on? Should I introduce the female or wait until the male makes a bubble nest or what? And if ready, how should i prepare?

She's terrified of the barking of other dogs, she is extremely cautious of other people that she meets...either in or outside of our home.  She shivers with fear when meeting other dogs.  We have been trying to keep her socialized with other dogs and people...but she just can't seem to get over her fear...any suggestions?  She is a mixed breed...though we do know her father is mixed with chow in him and her mother is mixed with american bulldog.  Our home is quite full of animals...4 cats (whom she gets along with quite well) a guinea pig (she has no interest in) and another dog...small mixed breed.  I also have 2 children ages 10 and 12 who she plays with constantly.  I'd sure appreciate any tips on how to deal with this before she gets too big!!

I am currently looking for a new trailer... just recently had to sell mine because my big horse did not fit at all! (  http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...  ), (  http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...  ) lol anyway, my trailer only sold for $800, it has quite a bit of rust, and it is hard to sell anything at this time :S.   So since i only got $800 out of it, i am definitely not rich, and can only go to $1,000. (I am looking at ads up to 1,300 since most are negotiable). Anyway since my horse is so big it has to be at least 7 feet long from chest area to butt bar. Everything i find that big is out of range! EXCEPT for stock trailers. It would be the perfect solution, but i here nothing but bad comments about them. So many people have told me that you cant use stock trailers on horses. Why are stock trailers so bad?   Also, any websites that i can find a trailer in this price range on?

20090128153426AAMnoPb	Pets;Dogs	Is this normal for my dog...?	I have a year old male shih tzu. He is un-neutered, cause when he was a puppy he was in an accident, and the vets wanted him to recover before anything, but we are getting him neutered soon. He is about 10 pounds. But anyway, when i feed him, (once a day), when he's eating, and i pet him, he feels SO skinny. Like around his stomach area, it's like grossly skinny. Then when he is done eating, he is normal. Is this odd? Could is be because his stomach is like contracting, or something, preparing for the food?      I know, once a day? My vet said it's fine for him.

I just learned about the apple twigs and guinea pigs bit (treats), and I was wondering, is it safe to give them twigs off of a crab apple tree? Are all apple trees safe?

20090128201619AAyS8IX	Pets;Dogs	I Think my Dog is Fixated?	Let me first start off on the weather here.   There is snow everywhere and under that snow is ice, which the snow is melting slowly so the roads are a bit slick.   Next, my dog.   My dog is a female Australian Cattle Dog who will be 2 in April and is very hyperactive because I do not walk here but will be soon, and has a bit of aggression towards dogs. And little kids.   And finally, to the question or whatever.   Tonight I took my dog out with the leash because I didn't want to wait for her to come back, and I myself wanted to walk in my very creepy at night (especially when there is snow everywhere!) wood-like backyard! After I traced the perimeter about 1 time, I took the leash off... With no pee or poop coming out of my dog's a**. So I decided to go in the front, to check the roads with her. Who knows, maybe I'd have some luck there?    So I traveled to the front, and my dog was great! She did get a bit fixated on the road that eventually leads the entrance of the neighborhood, but when I called her to me she came!    I think now is about time I tell you about... "The Big Black Dog".   There is a gentle dog opposite of the entrance (you take a right coming out of my driveway to get to the dog and a left to get to the entrance) and, well, my dog wants to really play with it! It's very gentle, no growling or snarling, but is very hyper! When I walk by it with Kaia, it runs along the fence and Kaia goes absolute crazy, tugging and lunging and barking and whining...   So tonight, what do you know? The Big Black Dog FRICKEN BARKS ONE TIME and my dog immediatly whips around and faces in it's direction. Her body is stock still, her ears forward, her tail straight up, her body tense.   "Kaia, come here! COME HERE!" I say, trying to sound "dominate". Her ear doesn't even twitch.   "KAI-A, CO-ME HE-RE." I say, very sternly, placing my words with meaning.   She bolts in the direction of the dog.   Okay, so there she leaves me, my nose and ears freezing, my hands too.    I walk slowly and with pride, trying to show her (if she's looking, 'cause I cannot see for a damn, but now exactly where she'd be) that I mean it.   "Kaia? Kaia, come here..." I whisper. Now this is where I think a failed a bit. I was scared. It was dark, snow everywhere...There are coyotes that hang around my house...   So I find her, and walk a bit closer to her. She looks at me, then bolts around the fence.   I try to get to her, but she just runs.   Now I am pissed.   "Alright, Kaia. I know you'll come home. I don't want to get frostbite.. or sick, so I'm leaving. Good luck with you."   And I walk back home.   I heard her freeze as I turned and took about 6 steps. I heard her collar jingling then stop, and it was like she was looking at my back. I felt guilty, but pushed it away. She WOULD come home.   So I went inside, furious, taking my scarf off. I hear scratching at the garage door. I rish to it, a bit afraid. It could be a coyote! I open it anyway, and Kaia jumps on me.   "Oh, K- No. Sit!" I command, quickly changing from lovy-follower to commanding-leader.   She sits.   "Stay!"   I say while I walk away, unzipping my jacket.   She comes.   I put her back in her place, saying Stay. This repeats three times, till I ultimitly test it out as I go inside for a minute, coming out and seeing her in the exact spots laying down.   I praise her.   Now please, how can I get my dog to not get fixated with The Big Black Dog?   Some might suggest walking by that dog a bunch of times, and I've tried that. Didn't work. I tried letting her sniff around the dog's fence, didn't work. I tried making her submit to the dog, didn't work.   This isn't just with the big black dog. It's also with people who walk down the streets, just that it's a tad different because Kaia just bolts at them without any hesitation.She'll follow them, jumping up on them (in a friendly way, not that she's trying to kill them).   Now if they have dogs, Kaia just gets in a bit of a dominance tussle. No blood is spilled, which I learned from the Dog Whisperer means she's just settling dominance than trying to be aggressive, which is normal in dogs.   So... do you know how to... "unfixate"  a dog?

She is a 1 year old chocolate lab and she is very friendly but she just doesnt listen very well. She listens to sit, sometimes, she obey Outside command on a dime, but she just doesnt listen to much else. i go ther she was about 10 months old and she was abused and neglected. She loves to lick and follow me around. I cant stop her from jumpingand scratching on my door when i put her out and when i put her in her kennel she is constantly barking and no matter what i do or say she wont stop untili let her out. i try to leash break her but she just doesnt learn. Also she pees in the house and wont stop. Also she likes to play but she bites when she plays. I also have another dog, Maltese, small, who is very territorial, who is always attacking my other dog and has started pooping in the house a lot more. What do i do to train them?

20090128150829AAyAsY2	Pets;Dogs	My staffy cross seems lethargic, stiff, swollen eyes, and not eating ?	Hello, I’m just wondering if you’d be able to help me with a question about my 4-5 year old staffy cross ?      he is generally very active and energetic, over the last week and a half he’s seemed very lethargic, went off his food then started eating again now isn’t eating again today (25/01/09) it tried to feed him blended chicken, rice, pasta and chicken soup through a syringe which was to no avail, drinking small amounts of water, his eyes seem to look funny and swollen, with us seeing him every day they don’t look normal although the vet said they look ok last Wednesday but then they were just bloodshot now they also look swollen, he is passing motion fine except for slight runniness and yellow/orange discolouration, (22/01/09) he went for a short walk and had 1 motion which was normal and 1 which was a little more runny and a little yellow, he goes through stages of getting better and picking up then dropping back down again, when he lays on his bed he doesn’t move for a couple of hours which isn’t like him AT ALL! then when he gets off his bed he seems stiff, when he’s standing his neck seems to be arched as if he can’t hold his head up, he was slightly limping on his rear left leg on (21/01/09) after returning from the vets which was fine the following day, when we took him to the vets she said he could have colic and administered a pain killer which she said should relax his stomach, I have read various forums etc on the internet and all say different things such as hypothermia, bloat, colic, twisted stomach, vile disease (caused by rodents) or even food allergies or anything we walk him in woodland type terrain so there could be presence of many plants that could be dangerous to him, but he’s been walked there all his life, we also have another dog which is a Staffy Cross aged around 12-13 and she seems fine and is in quite good health for her age, one thing we have noticed before, is when she urinates he sniffs around it and sometimes licks it, she has had a hysterectomy so I thought she wouldn’t have a smell ? All this worries me quite a bit as I love him to bits and would like to get to the bottom of the problem, please could you help? Today is (25/01/09) Sunday, i plan to ring for an appointment emergency tomorrow, but id still like anyone to answer this query if they might know anything? Thanks

20090128200445AAECd5h	Pets;Horses	White eye discharge, runny nose and scabs on Hind quater?	I've been asked to retrain a standardbred that was abandoned recently at this agistment centre. I was curious as to what these things were on his Left Hind Quater. They are about cm to inch long with thick grey scabs over top. The hair around them is growing like normal except for on the scabs. They dont appear to cause any discomfort to him and don't weep but have started to spread down his leg. I don't know his previous owners or where he came from   and becasue i don't own him (technically no one owns him now!) he isn't getting vet checked.  He also has thick white eye discharge from both eyes and a runny nose. His eyes are clear though and his coat is shiny and soft and he's always alert when being ridden. He is out in a large paddock with other horses. Are the scabs on his  quater, the eye discharge and nose discharge linked? is it a serious allergy?  Currently it's summer.

My question is how tough is the AKC being about giving them out? I am considering a border collie mix to adopt for agility, and I feel that he definitely resembles a border collie. I want this dog specifically for agility, and I mainly compete in AKC agility so I would like for it to be able to as well.      From what I have heard the AKC just wants the money, so as long as the dog looks similar, they don't have any issues, or give much of a problem.      Anyone have any feedback?

20090128163157AARr2wy	Pets;Dogs	Doesa anybody else's pets out there have this??!?	At the moment my Big dog (Red golden retriever... Shes larger sized than most because she's a red and yes she's purebred.)   Well she has a small space to play and run (mabye not big enolugh to run even) outside since only a small portion of our backyard is fenced and it bothers me because she dosent have much space to run in and boy does she ever love to run. we take her on lots of walks during the day and keep her inside at night, but unless you have a fence that goes down at least a foot under ground she will escape, and the way our house is put i dont think i could get a fence, like that it would have to open for cars. So i've been looking around and wanted to get a Humane electronic fence.....  I know they give a little shock if the dog goes out of boundries but thats about the only thing that can keep my escape artist of a dog in and i really want to give her the best so she needs a bigger play area, Does anyone out there use a humane electronic fence? I'm going to buy one but if any of you out there are giiving one away for less than $200 i"ll take that too..... But im not realy here to take your stuff just to ask your advice.... Should i use one? I've asked a couple really experianced dog people i know and they say it might be a good idea. What do you say?      (**Please do not leave any rude remarks, im looking for advice not for someone calling me stupid )      To all the people who leave answers out there......      THANKS!!!!! ?

20090225150025AADstKm	Pets;Horses	Critique this advert for me?  Should I look at this horse?	I would like to go from an "open lease" on which my daughter and I ride whatever horse is available, to leasing just one horse, that we would share.  I will have to field board the horse.  My daughter is 11.  she can w/t/c and is starting to jump, but she is very timid.  she needs a horse she can really trust and bond with.  I am back to riding after 20 years away.  I am relearning how to jump.  I don't have any plans to go eventing, but it might be fun to jump in a show.  I have good balance and am confident, but am no expert.      I don't think there is a horse at my barn that would fill the bill for us.  The really new riders are using the lesson horses my daughter loves, because they need the quiet ones.  So sometimes my daughter doesn't have a quiet horse to ride when we go.  So I think I need to either buy us a horse (hmm, expensive), or find one to lease that my barn owner does not already own.      OK, so I found this ad.  I am in the local area to this horse.  She says he "can be pushy on the ground."  Would you translate that as a real terror?  You know how people "underexagerate" in ads!  Otherwise he seems to be the perfect size and age, is nice looking and might be a good match for both of us.      Any feedback appreciated!  Thanks!       http://www.virginiaequestrian.com/main.c...

A few hours later, he was bouncing off the walls due to body discomfort.  He was foaming at the mouth, was dry retching, was having trouble swallowing, and also seemed to be having a hard time keeping his airway open.  I don't think I slept all night.  I gave him some Benedryl and scrubbed him down with soap, in the bathtub.  While drying him off, I called the emergency hotline for the product.  The fellow on the helpline had me wash him again in Dawn Dish washing Liquid and give him some Pepto Bismol.  This morning, I called his vet, and was told that over the counter flea and tick products are stronger and less safe pets.  They told me to go back to Frontline or Advantix because they are much safer.      I wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience with their pet?

20090128181933AAEc6Fz	Pets;Dogs	I feel terrible I killed the family dog?	It was an accident, I loved her so much and I feel so bad!   She was a very loving Spaniel x Bull terrier named Jessy,    well this is how it happened, me and my boyfriend were arguing, I was in the car I was about to drive off to have time to myself because i didn't want to argue, and my boyfriend didn't want me to drive off so he hopped on the bonnet of the car, Jessy hates arguments, so she was barking around the car at us to stop, at this time i was so angry at my boyfriend for stopping me from going out i was driving back and forth in the drive way trying to get him off the car but he wouldn't get off so I chucked the car into drive and put my foot down and ran over Jessy, I thought she was behind the car!    I got out of the car and looked back, i had killed her instantly but what was worse I called out to her, at that moment it was like she heard me she seemed to wag her tail and she was trying to get up but then her nerves stopped I know it was just her nerves because she was obviously dead.    Was it the spirit of Jessy that heard me call her name and was just leaving her body as she didn't know she was dead?   Mum tells me that animals don't have spirits and all that but she is so wrong.   I feel horrible, was it my fault? My boyfriends for being on the car? or no-body's?   Best answer gets 10 points and anyone being abusive will be reported i already feel bad enough.

I have 2 other cats and a dog. The 2 other cats have been here for a different amount of time, one for 3 years and the other for 1 and 1/2, so I don't think it's them. I don't think it is the dog either, because he is not allowed to come in, nor can he fit through the cat door.      I leave the door to the bathroom open so they can get in, I've tried putting something in the place that she likes to pee in, but she just pees near it... then I have 2 spots to clean up. I don't want to put the litter box in my room because then my room would smell worse.       I clean the litter box often enough and she still decides to go pee on my floor. Shes fixed and so are my other cats.       I need help making her not pee on the floor and getting rid of the smell, PLEASE HELP!!      P.S.   I've been advised not to use ammonia. and I've already tried using  Glade (R) Carpet & Room, this only worked until she peed there again.

20090225145942AAWTQIV	Pets;Dogs	Best thing to help my puppies baby teeth fall out?	I have a min schnauzer, and she's 5 months, close to 6 and she is going to be spayed in about three weeks. Her vet said that her baby teeth were preventing her adult teeth to grow in correctly, and if they didn't fall out between now and her spaying that they would pull them while she is already under doing the spay. Thing is, she said it could be anywhere between 35 to 140 dollars or more, depending on how many they pull. Yes I will pay it, before anyone yells at me for having a pet but no money to take care of it. I will pay for it if that's what has to be done. But it is kinda expensive, I'd rather spend that money on toys and other things to spoil her with. What things can I do to help them fall out naturally? I bought her a kong, but she doesn't like it, and I've tried sticking everything in it. What can I do, or get her?

20090225150525AAiBoZC	Pets;Birds	Can a 5 week old baby parakeet eat human baby food? HELP!?	I have two 5 week old baby parakeets with only a mom and not a dad.  Dad would try to help out, but when he would, Mom was really aggressive and would attack him.  Since then, Mama Bird has been doing a great job and has been feeding them... until last night.  I went to check their crops and they are pretty empty.        I have a new syringe and a can of Exact baby parakeet food for this emergency situation.  I've mixed the food according to directions: not too warm, about 102 degrees, and a little thinner than the consistency of applesauce.        I took each bird to feed, and they won't have any of it.  One started to open its beak and I started introducing the syringe in a bobbing motion to mimic their mom.  He opened his beak a little, but upon taking a little, shook it all off!        I am thinking that:    A.  Maybe mama bird is weaning the birds (they are about 5 weeks old now), or    B. The chicks don't like the flavor.        In any case, I don't want to come home and find them dead.        Can I feed these guys human baby food? Food like: peas, carrots, something nutritious and not too sweet.  What do you guys think?

20090225151715AA6Yzst	Pets;Cats	My new stray cat's belly is huge!?	when I got her last night, she was rail thin, probably about 6 months old tortoiseshell. I fed her and she ate 2 bowls (about a good size fists worth) of dry food in less than 8 hours. She drinks alot more water than any cat I have ever had before. This morning (still going at the food every 15 min or so when she is not sleeping or loving on us) her belly is very big, and stretched pretty tight. When I palpate I feel no golfball size/shape objects (which I read is a pregnancy sign). She is urinating and pooping just fine, I think. She seems to take a little time to urinate but that may be that she is shy to do it while I am watching. I believe she is showing signs of being in heat too, so that also makes me think she is not pregnant. I have only had her less than 12 hours so far so I couldnt tell you how she was before we got her. She is very loving but seems a tiny bit lethargic for a cat that seems so young, but maybe its because she is constantly being stuffed. Is she just afraid of going hungry again and keeping herself stuffed, or does she have tapeworms or fluid belly? please help!

20090128184708AAKwSpq	Pets;Cats	Why does cat food turn dark an hour or so after opening?	Well my cat is really picky and not always very hungry (I feed her two cans a day and leave dry food out for her to pick). I noticed that she likes to eat incrementally and not at once. So when I feed her she usually leaves half the can. And since I spend a lot of money on her natural cat-food, I feel bad throwing it away. I just cover it tightly with some plastic wrap and put it into the fridge immediately. Then a couple of hours later I take it out to cool down and then give it to my cat again. She usually doesn't eat it the second time around...only sometimes. I always wondered why.       Then I noticed yesterday that the cat food takes on a bad smell and looks darker if I store it in the fridge for a later feeding. I asked my mom about it and she said, "It turned darker because there are lots of bacteria in cat food that multiply quickly, thus causing the food to rot quickly, even if refrigerated." Is my mom right? Could I have been feeding my cat rotten cat food? Please explain if you can! Thanks! =)

20090128193248AAUL2jB	Pets;Cats	Please help with my cat? I think it may be serious?	I have 3 cats, 2 girls (a 3-5 year old and a 7-8 year old) and one boy, Frank, I don't know how old he is, but I know he is a vibrant young male that couldn't be older than 5. He was a stray my friends friend had picked up and couldn't care for, so we took him in and took him to the vet to get him neutered, tested, registered, etc. He's a bit moody at times, and he often bites people/things, but I think he may have problems with his gums. He always chews on books and his gums look swollen despite his healthy teeth. Do you know of any other cats having this issue with their gums? Also, I think he may have a bleeding ulcer, there is blood in his stool. This happened to a kitten I used to have, but that's because he had Feline Leukemia, and Frank and the girls have been tested numerous times and are all negative. Any suggestions as to what all of this may be? My family will schedule an appointment with our veterinarian.

I've also heard that 2 boys might kill each other and so it's best to get 2 girls. Is that also true?  Are girls as colorful as boys? I don't really have a preference between boys and girls; I just want them to be colorful,  happy, and get along with each other!

20090128185127AAhSpL1	Pets;Horses	Strange symptoms, anyone experienced this before?	all right first off I just want to say, I don't need anyone telling me that I should get the vet out, it has already been done and his visits are still ongoing. I am just trying to find anyone who has experienced similar symptoms before to find out how they dealt with this and whether there is any possibility of it happening again.      Ok so yesterday my horse seemed fine when we took some other horses out riding, when we came back though we could tell that something wasn't right with him. He seemed almost drunk, occasionally staggering to the side instead of walking straight, and you could tell by looking at his eyes that something wasn't right. We thought maybe he had grass staggers because he had been turned out in a paddock by himself with a lot of long grass. so we put him in a pen to let the toxins diminish from his system and checked up on him every so often. he progressively got worse, at which stage the vet was called although he was busy. By the time the vet got there my horse was having periods of staggering around in circles, swaying, clicking his teeth, was having muscle spasms had his head down and seemed like he was trying to cough something up almost. He was also slightly stiff had a fever and sweating profusely, when this was happening he would avoid having any people in his personal space, but all this would subside slightly to the point where he was standing still and calm and seemed appreciative of contact and was looking for food. He ended up going down, in a similar fashion to how a horse with tetanus would, (legs out in front, while falling backwards, kind of like how a dog or cat would lie down) except his head was down instead of up. the vet thought it could be tetanus but said the symptoms he was showing were not typical of tetanus, he also suggested a possible abcess on the brain or something which i dont remember the name of (but sounded like syphilis) which he said my horse would not survive the night with. He basically told us to prepare to have to put him down and then gave him a HUGE odse of penicillian, something to ease his muscle spasms, and an anti inflamatory to reduse swelling on the brain if thats what he had. He also got two other injections although they weren't explained fully. we did get him back up again, although he fell over twice more through out the night, he also ate a feed of chaff. This morning he seems to have recovered to the point where he is out grazing in a paddock again (not the same one as yesterday) and all that seems wrong with him is that he is slightly stiff and his balance is still a little off. The vet still doesn't know what is wrong with him and suggested a brain scan last night somewhere between putting him down and having a deadly virus. Has anyone experienced any kind of symptoms like this before and if you have can you tell me more about it, could he relapse? is it contagious? etc etc?   thank you, sorry for the lengthy description, I hope you had the patience to read it....

When I own a horse, I am going to be riding with a bareback pad most of the time or occasionally in a saddle. Right now I have a western saddle but that one is too big for me (I got it from my friend). I am looking at jumping maybe just once or twice (just over a small barrel) but I will only be actually riding my horse about once a month and taking lessons once a week.

20090128190430AAP7jcu	Pets;Rodents	I don't think my new hamster is very happy. :( I think I've done everything right though.?	I got a month old teddy bear hamster 2 days ago. I'm really confused. I'm sure I've done everything right. Big cage, wheel, some tubes, a house, a wood chew toy. Water, food. But she doesn't seem happy today. She was sleeping in her little house pretty much all day and occasionally sneaking out to get food. She's awake now, and she looked bright and curious for a few minutes. But she only was on her wheel for about 30 seconds, and looked around a little. I gave her a piece of an apple, and she nibbled a little off of it, then went back in her house. When I first came into m room she was frozen for about a minute, and then twitched a little. It looked really wrong... like she was  scared. :( I've been so nice to her. I talk to her a lot when she's up and walking around. The night before last she was a little fire ball! Very energetic. She acted strange yesterday, too, but then got a little hyper in the evening and was on her wheel for an hour or more. (While I was awake, anyway.) It's like she's having weird little mood swings. Happy, nervous, shy, energetic, happy, nervous, shy... It's confusing to me.  Heh, sorry if I seem like a total noob. She's my first hamster and I thought she'd be happier. I know it takes them a while to get used to their new home, but still. I'm worried about her. Just a little baby. :( Please help me out. Does it sound like there's something wrong with her?

So we took me cat (who is 12 years old) to the vet, and they did blood tests and told us her kidneys were in fact failing. She threw up and has not eaten or drank in days...she seemed weak, but was still happy when we pet her because she was purring loudly. However, we decided to put her down just tonight because the doctor said it would not likely she get better, and it would cost a lot of money to treat her to a longer life.       Is there anything we could have done for her? I feel sad that I am regretting this decision, but didn't want her to suffer!

I found an egg sac in my tank that houses three african clawed frogs, one fish, one bottom feeder and two snails for clean up. When the sac are born, will the parents die?

20090128195019AAYJwhA	Pets;Birds	Is a Pionus a good parrot for me? ?	This will be my very first bird.  I am prepared for the responsibilities and I have done lots of research, but I would really appreciate someone else's opinion!!!  I have looked at many species of parrot, and one in particular that i am interested the Pionus.  I want to know if this bird is ok for what i want in a bird, and also me being a beginner.   I am looking for a bird that is:    -As quiet as possible [please don't tell me that no parrots are quiet, because i know that.  I just mean in general, i want a species that is the most quiet compared to the others]    -Cuddly (I reeeally want a cuddly bird!  I want one that i can scratch and give butterfly kisses to and just all around snuggle with a lot!)    -Needs less then around 4 hours of play-time every day.  [I will definitely spend as much time as possible with my bird, but every now and then i do get jammed up with homework, so it IS possible i might miss a couple days a month...(not entire days, just an hour or so less]    -Is less then $500.  [I did find that Pionus's were quite more expensive then the other birds I am looking at, but i am willing to pay as long as I know that this type of bird really is the right bird for me.]         You do not have to go into detail about all of the topics i listed (I would really love that though!!!!)   A little comment for each would be great [the more, detailed the better though]       Also, do not know exactly what specific kind of Pionus I should get, and if anyone has any suggestions that would be great!    The other birds i am currently looking at are the Cockatiel and the Budgie.  If you do have other suggestions besides these, please suggest them!!!!    Thanks soooo much!!!!  I really appreciate anyone's help!!!

20090128200934AAzYCf4	Pets;Horses	How much room should a horse have in a grazing/exercise pasture?	I'm looking into buying a lot of land to hold my horse on to cut down on boarding costs, and it'll be close to home so I can see him more often and do most of the work myself.      So how much room would one horse need? The pasture will be used for light grazing (not meant to gain nutricional value but just for natural instinct) and mainly for exercise during the day. I'm thinking about 3/4 of an acre? I'm really unsure so estimates would be great!      By the way, don't tell me that they need to be an over an acre. I don't believe that because most pastures I've seen are just bigger than that for 2-3 horses. But I've never seen a 1 horse pasture so that's why I need to know. Thanks!

20090128194318AAIxSLI	Pets;Cats	Why is my cat trying to hump me all of the sudden?	I recently acquired a male adult cat because my neighbours left him behind when they moved. He is a lovely, well behaved cat and I have had him now for about 6 months now. In the last 2 weeks he has started doing the thing where he kneads on you and will suckle on your sleeve as if you were his mother. At first I thought it was cute and people told me it was normal so I used to just ignore it or put him somewhere else to do it, but recently he has started humping when he does it as well??? I always push him off when he does that but why would he start doing that all of the sudden? It's like he is randy all of the time and is humping everything now. I don't get why though because I have never seen him hump anything before. Anyone know why the sudden randyness? Its making me feel uncomfortable...
20090128193422AA4V0tq	Pets;Cats	Will my cat remember me?	I got a farm cat who had babies.  i kept two of them.  Recently, I saw an ad from someone who was looking to replace their cat who passed away.  The stipulation was that the replacement must look identical to their cat who passed away.  Mine fit the bill.  I wasn't planning to ever give this cat away, but I really felt that the odds of a perfect match were slim to none, and since I am a sucker for karma etc.. I offered this 6 month old kitten to them.     I told them that I would happily take him back, no matter how distant into the future..3 years, 5 years etc..it didn't matter.  What I am wondering, is if this little boy was ever returned to me after a significant amount of time, if he would remember that he once lived here.  Would he remember me, or will I be a stranger after time?

I was told to start cold turkey, however, she started vomiting, had diarrhea and is refusing food. My other vet said to put her on bland diet and never too switch foods too fast.  I know you must do so for this condition however, in my case I guess I should go gradually. So I am going to try to mix the new food to the old gradually for a week until her tummy gets better . Is this ok? She is still on the antibiotic.

20090128195745AAMJEB8	Pets;Dogs	Is there a good time to remove the dog crate?	Hi everyone! We have a 2 yr. old who got her from Humane Society just over a year ago. She was incredibly timid, as she spent her first 7 months outdoors. When we adopted her, the HS recommended we crate her, as she had never lived in a house. It took a while, but soon she was very comfortable with her (very girly) crate. We started giving her more freedom as we would leave, until she destroyed 5 pairs of shoes. We decided to keep her confined to the living room, where she has plenty of room, but can't destroy much. This has worked great for the last 10 mos.      She will sometimes go in her crate to nap, but aside from that she sleeps in bed with us and has all access when we are home. When we leave she is in living/dining room. So, do we remove the crate to make more space, or would that be upsetting to her (she still has some confidence issues)? I don't mind leaving it as long as she may need it, but if we don't need it, I'd rather have more space.    Thanks :)

Do you prefer one over the other?? Some people said how they would use Advantage in the summer and then Frontline in the winter. It just seems as if I'm not having good luck with the Frontline.          I also flea treat my lawn and home with a flea spray according to the fleas life cycle. We are moving Friday to Savannah and I want to be prepared for this summer as I've heard the horror stories about the fleas in the summer down here. We have already had someone out there to treat the lawn and home before we bring our babies down.      I have 4 Shepherds and a Pomeranian (if that helps)

20090128194145AAAdDWB	Pets;Fish	Cycling a tank, quick question, best ans?	I'm thinking of getting another tank and of course it needs to be cycled fishless before getting the fish. I know that taking gravel from an established tank can help speed up the process but is it okay if i use some of the gravel from my established 10 gallon tank and then put it back? Cuz in my 10g, i have multicolored gravel but i just want one color gravel in the new tank. If i use the established gravel, will it spread the bacteria onto the new gravel? And then i can put the multicolored gravel back to its 10g?

20090128202306AAq4Qvc	Pets;Horses	Horse dangerously scared of vet...?	I have owned my 11 year old gelding from day one. He has never had any behavioral problems with my 6'2" male farrier, but he has steadily become worse every year with our vet who is of the same size.      I (small female) can clean his sheath with cold hose water, he lets me swat horse flies off of his face when I ride, has never tried to kick me, etc. He's never had a problem with any of the males of my family, and while they have never offered to clean him they can worm him and do anything else. I get my friends to bring their brothers over and we have a "mock" vet session. I bring him out, they poke and prod him all over. Sometimes he'll flinch a bit, or start to sidestep, but I put him back in place and he settles down.      When the vet comes, He's nervous, he starts to twitch before he is approached, and last time he went straight up in the air and tried to wheel away from us. We had to eventually innoculate him with a twitch on his lip.      Any help?

20090128193525AAbaZ2O	Pets;Dogs	My 7 year old Bull Terrier is having accidents in the house.?	I adopted a seven year old English Bull Terrier who I named Gracy in June.  She has allergy problems that my vet has yet to fully diagnose and other issues as well.  She is good natured, and plesant around most people.  However, when I adopted her I was single, and am now seeing someone.  At first Gracy was very un-enthused about my new girl friend, but is slowly warming up.  They don't like each other but are learning to get along, my girl friend is not a dog person.  I've noticed over the last few weeks that Gracy is having accidents in the house when my girl friend is around.  My girl friend, Jean, thinks the dog is doing it for attention and that the dog is too demanding and I am not strict enough.  If I catch Gracy in the act of misbehavior I scold her and do something to correct the behavior.  If she jumps on the sofa, which she is not allowed on, I yell and shoo her off.  She is allowed in the bed, but that is the onyl piece of furniture she is allowed on in the house.  She is not allowed on the bed while Jean is arond, and Jean seems to think this might be confusing the dog.  I don't let her up when Jean is around because she says it makes the bed smell, "Doggy".  Do dogs have accidents to get attention?  I'm not sure what to do and any advice you could give would be appreciated.

20090128200524AA4RCZF	Pets;Dogs	Splenic Hemangiosarcoma in a golden retriever, extremely desperate for answers?	Our family golden retriever of 14 years was just diagnosed with a splenic hemangiosarcoma today.  Her spleen (I think, I honestly don't have much knowledge of the specifics) is extremely swollen right now, and the vet said that her spleen could burst at any time because of the cancerous cells.  We know that she's been on borrowed time for a while now, but it's pretty frightening thinking that her time is now.      My question is, is there anything to help delay the inevitable without going through surgery?  As in, is there any kind of vitamin or diet that she can be on to help her for at least a little while?  Because, as selfish as this may seem, I want my mom to be able to see her one last time when she comes home on Friday morning from a business trip.      I know that the odds are slim, but my vet offered me very little advice, and I haven't been able to find much of anything through my own means.  Any serious advice is appreciated so much more than you know.

In May of last year he developed a brown spot on his ear, it has since gotten much darker, and now is doubled in size.  My vet says it is possibly a freckle.  It doesn't look like any skin cancers that I have researched, but mostly the pictures were squamous cell.  I have a medical (humans) background, and if he were a human I might be suspicious of a such quick changes. The area is at the edge of his ear and doesn't have asymmetrical edges.  Does anyone know where to find a good resource of feline freckle or cancer images of the pinna or anywhere on the ear? Please help, I love him dearly and I don't want to disregard this if it is serious.

20090128201522AAxAN4g	Pets;Fish	Why is my juvenile calico fantail flashing in his tank?	Okay, here's the deal. Little dude is a juvenile calico fantail, he's in a tank with a 10 inch live plant, and an apple snail that is about an inch in diameter. The substrate is large gravel. I've had this tank a year, and a few different sets of fish have been in it. The first three (I know, too many for a 5 gallon, they were very small and I was naive) died from overfeeding (my little sister is responsible for this), Like six months after I got them. Then, I emptied the tank, cleaned, and put in the snail and a new juvenile red-capped oranda. The redcap died about a month after I got it, I'm not sure what from, it wasn't a disease from what I could tell, and the behavior changed very quickly; became super lethargic and i found him in the base of the plant the next day. The snail is fine. I cleaned out the tank, and now brought this punk into the picture. Now, he's definitely a very active swimmer, darts around a lot, like he did in the tank at the shop, but for the past two weeks it hasn't been seizure-like at all. When I got back today it seemed he's twitching somewhat often, both like laterally with his whole body and also with individual fins. The tank is a five gallon, and I do 50% water changes pretty much twice a week, dechlorinated and temp-conditioned water. I'm worries that maybe my snail is like poisoning him or something. Can this happen randomly to goldfish sometime? Is there some neurotoxin in my tank leftover from old fish? His fins look clear, they're not ragged, no dots of white or anything. His eyes/scales are shiny and clear. The tank is covered and I don't use aerosols. What's going on?
