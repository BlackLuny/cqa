eulMjLtPaa	As the above guy said, if you contact an airport employee when you first get there, they can help you.  In lieu of that:    If possible, the night before you leave, check in online. (go to the airline site and follow the instructions.) This not only gives you a better boarding priority, but you can print your boarding pass as well.      If you haven't done that, when you get to the airport, get in line at your airline's ticket counter.  Give them your confirmation number (or show them a printout of your confirmation), and they will issue your boarding pass.      Go to the security line.  Show your ID and boarding pass.  Go through security (where you will take off your shoes and put them, your bag, coat through the xray machines).      Gather your stuff.  Your boarding pass will have your departure gate number on it.  Look at the big board to see where your gate is.  Go there.    PS--Be sure to check your airline's baggage restrictions to make sure your carryon fits their size criteria.  If not, you'll have to check it.|`|36SJ9nGAaa	i understand!  i just went on my first plane also!  last summer to idaho!  have fun=D|`|O8JPoGffaa	1.  Go to the airport.  2.  Go to the departures section.  3.  Look for a ground hostess.  3. Ask the ground hostess for assistance.    It's easy, no cause for stress, they are there to help.|`|Lf16A5sYaa	You'll check in first.  You can usually do this online at home before you leave for the airport, but you can also did it at your airline's counter at the airport.  When you check-in, you'll get boarding passes (you'll print these from your printer if you do it at home online).    Next you'll go through security.  Make sure you don't have anything in your carry-on that isn't allowed.  Plus all liquids have to be in a bottle no larger than 3 fluid ounces and all those bottles have to fit into a quart size ziploc bag that will close.  Take that bag out of your carryon and place it on top.  Also you will have to take off your coat or jacket and your shoes.  Place the carryon directly on the rollers and everything else in one of the bins.    Next find a monitor finding which gate you're leaving from and go there.  Have a good time.|`|KaP78IoBaa	Don't be nervous is just plain easy. First you have to do check-in, which is just registering yourself. As you are only taking carry on baggage it should be very easy and fast, as you have no bags to register, they airline employees just will confirm your data and issue your boarding pass. With an e-ticket is just the same and paper tickets, it's even better, as you don't have to worry about losing it because the airline has your ticket in their reservation systems, so you just need your id (I am assuming this is a domestic flight) for them to confirm you are you (that sounds funny, I know) and search for your ticket in their system and that's it. If you payed for your ticket via credit card, you can even do your check-in in a kiosk, which is a machine that issues your boarding pass after confirming you are you using your credit card. This is only possible for hand-bag-only carriers (as you) and may be available or not depending on your airline and the Airport you are departing from.    After this you pass through a security check, where officers (or the people doing the check) search you for potentially dangerous items such as cutting devices or anything that can be used to harm other people. They can even take liquids you are carrying (the US has a very strict policy concerning this). Any way, they will take your handbag through an x-ray machine and you through a metal-detection device in search for dangerous or illegal objects.    Finally you enter the airside area (this mean you are on the side of the aiport where you board the plane). On international terminals of airports there is a duty free area, but if it is national there will probably be just normal stores and cafes. I believe that the liquids you buy on these are permitted on flights, but you should ask. Finally you must search the gate assigned to your flight and when they call for boarding (via speaker at the aiport or in the information screens) they ask you for your boarding pass and they might do a last security check (although this is not done every time) and you are free to board.    I might may have made this sound very complicated, its just check-in/security/ gate control and you are done. I was just trying to explain the details. Hope this helps, and just dint be nervous at all, flying is great and easy.

94b8KImYaa	Can't say anything about the USA's high crime rate among racial minorities which you claim, since not all information is available on this. The numbers provided by the media (to you and to me) are not necessarily the entire truth. But this is a different subject alltogether.     For me ( a European) it seems that many people still feel like they are in the Wild West and need to have guns to shoot the one who looks funny at them.   Then there are the expectations, that one is only worth something when one has money - regardless how he got that. So if this means doing it the criminal way - it is ok - and is easily forgotten on how the person got their money.   The other reason I think is the big gap between rich and poor and a general frustration that one has to work 3 jobs and it is still not enough.     The media has a big part in this. I remember being in the US, when the sniper out of the car trunk was captured. Instead of giving a report on the necessities the whole thing was made up like a movie, the same pictures shown thousands of times, with a capturing voice, telling me to stay tuned, because the news about the sniper will come up shortly. In the end they did not tell me anything new, but I felt I had been brainwashed for the last 2 hours.     Now, what would happen, if not only there would be a strict gun control, but if there would be no more guns - anywhere in the world.     Yes there are other ways to commit a crime, but chances to survive that are greater.|`|9CCtt077aa	I'll never understand America's obsession with guns. Gun control is the only solution to solve these crimes.
KGBBSsVfaa	That is pretty horrible. I certainly don't know the policies of Tokyo's EMS and their Hospital system, but all I can say as that as a paramedic here in the USA in CT, hospitals here sometimes go on diversion when they are full and have no beds left. This is instantly made known to all dispatch stations in the area, who warn EMS crews immediately upon responding to a call of the hospital on diversion and what hospital has agreed to take that patients that the diverting hospital would have taken, and in cases of serious, immediate emergencies, a patient is still taken to the diverting hospital if it is closest and capable of dealing with the type of emergency that that patient is experiencing - for example, if the patient is a serious trauma case, then only a trauma facility is an appropriate destination for the patient. Hospitals here are not allowed to deny a patient that shows up at their ER even if they are on diversion, so the solution is that if an EMS crew feels that the patients only chance of survival is the hospital that is on diversion, they don't patch in ahead of time, as they will be refused, citing diversion, and just simply shows up and bust in through the doors with the patient. At this point, the hospital cannot ethically or legally turn the patient away and they make room for him by bumping a minor case patient into a hallway bed or chair somewhere to make room for the critical patient.     In the area I work in, the Trauma Facility most often goes on diversion, bogged down with local walk ins and minor cases transported by ambulance based on the fact that it's the closest facility for many of the 911 calls I respond to. However, there are 2 other hospitals, one of which will most likely officially accept patients that would have been headed for the Trauma Facility when it's on diversion, and both hospitals are only 10 minutes further away by ambulance. There are another 3 hospitals within 20 more minutes, and for many stable patients with non-life threatening injuries or illnesses, the extra 10 or 20 minute ride is not a problem for the patient, and only a problem for getting my ambulance back into service quickly to be ale to respond to the next 911 call in my response area. And, like I said, just simply showing up and saying "surprise" with a critical patient at the hospital on diversion because it's the patient's only hope of getting into surgery in time to save their life forces their way into the diverting hospital, who will bump the patient to the top of the triage list and move something like a person with a finger requiring stitches, or a patient awaiting a commercial ambulance ride to a psychiatric hospital for depression treatment or drug or alcohol rehabilitation, into a chair in a hallway to make bed space available for patients who truly need it.     Common sense is a large part of emergency medicine and thankfully, is still fairly common in my area, which has never resulted in the death of a patient because no hospital would take him or her as far as I know in the 10 years I've worked in EMS. It is quite tragic that the situation in Tokyo is such that they turn away patients who need critical care only available in a hospital, causing their death as the ambulance races around trying to find a hospital willing to take the patient. Every hospital you go to will always have at least a few patients who don't need urgent emergency room care for their problem and can be set aside for later treatment when the hospital has time. Since so many people in this country don't have health insurance, many use the emergency room of their local hospital as their primary care physician, going there whenever they have a cold or illness that a local doctor's office could easily handle. However, since doctor's won't take patients who are unable to pay, but hospitals have to by law, patients routinely use the ER for the average illness and travel there simply to get a prescription for an anti-biotic, sometimes clogging the ER so much the hospital has to go on diversion, delaying the care of truly emergent situations. I don't know what the answer is, but something has to be done about it, because all of these people forced to use the ER for minor situations that could easily be handled by a doctor's office raise operating costs for the hospital (since they don't get paid for these thousands of visits every year), resulting in higher health insurance costs for those of us who are insured, and less bed space in ER'ss for people who really need it. It's tragic that the situation in Tokyo has gotten to the point where people are dying because hospital ER's are so clogged that they turn away critical patients.|`|hEA7LwC4aa	The governor of Tokyo Ishihara's interest is not human life but Olympics.

But it was only a suggestion by a journalist with knowledge about the ER system abroad.  I'm greatly worried by the tendency to wave aside elderly patients whose recovery is more difficult and slower than younger people, and who are generally weaker than younger patients.  My personal opinion on the lack of serious ER reform is that it doesn't affect the government. If a patient dies the scapegoat will always be a hospital or a doctor,nobody's going to sue the government. Besides, do you remember Aso's remarks on elderly and handicapped people?|`|CUMdhfKzaa	So, what are you going to do about it?

nHuMeLtyaa	In 1947, David Ben-Gurion told the Arabs that this land was going to be a Jewish State but begged them to stay and be a part of it.  Some did, some didn't.  When the War of Independence began in 1948 the Arab nations got on the radio and told the Arabs living in and around the new State to leave since they didn't want them to be in the way when they killed all the Jews.  Many more left.  Big mistake. When Israel signed the armistice, the Jews didn't let the Arabs come back to their homes.  It's their own fault.  If they would have stayed they would have had a much better life than the ones they lead now.  Sorry, but to the victor goes the spoils.  Other Arabs do care.  In the city of Um Al Fahem no terrorist attacks coming out of the West Bank could have been perpetrated without their knowledge or facillitation.  This is common knowledge to law enforcement in Israel.|`|Kggz7Eyiaa	The Arab people do care. The leaders are unfortunately weak and corrupt.    Also, there is a difference between 'not caring' and killing innocent civilians, firing on the UN and limiting food, water and aid into Gaza. Quite a large difference.    edit  -----------------  Arieh: That is completely false. No mention of the 'ethnic cleansing' of Palestine. Where Jewish terrorist groups massacred large numbers of innocent, unarmed Palestinians with the intention of creating fear amongst the Palestinian population so that they would flee their homes.

Fundamentalist Islam is a religion rooted in seventh century teachings that are fundamentally opposed to democracy and equality.     Radical Islamists are utterly contemptuous of all "infidels" (non-Muslims) and regard them as enemies worthy of death.    Mandrassas in America and Canada  are increasing in number and they are one part of a growing radical Islamic army on Canadian and US soil.    Radical Islam exploits the US legal system and America's protection of religion to spread the hatred for western values.    This declaration of war has not come from nationals of a particular country. Thet owe allegiance only to Mohammed's original ideology. They represent no country. They do not wear the uniform of a country's armed forces. Radical Islamists consider all people, in or out of uniform , who do not believe in the original Islam if Mohammed, to be the enemy until they convert or subject to Islamic Law.    Even so-called "moderate" Muslims, who don't agree with these jihadists' devotion to the purest form of Islam or their terror tactics, respect their passion and commitment.

The greatest supporters of Palestine are Iran and Syria who provide monetary support.    The rest of the Middle East live peacefully and do not want the current situation disturbed. They tend to see the Palestinians as a bit of a nuisance and a threat to their way of life.    Take Egypt as an example. Egypt is a neighbor of Gaza and has offered little help during the current situation. They have kept their border firmly closed and not allowed any Palestinians to leave except for some on humanitian grounds.    Egypt simply does not want Hamas to set up in Egypt and continue their fight from there.    Even the Palestinians do not agree with each other. The Palestinians in the West Bank have told Hamas they are responsible for the current situation.    The Middle East is a strange place?|`|ie5AKYToaa	Arabs do care about the Palestinians. It's just the stupid leaders that they have who are afraid of the United States.
74RNHyxHaa	Politically, Hamas won and Israel lost.   But Israel still has the blockade up, they still have their soldiers on the edge of Gaza, while the Palestinians are still starving, aid is not being let into Gaza.

If Israel went to Gaza to bring Shalit back the arrested Israeli solder they returned without him.  If Israel went to Gaza to end Hamas, Hamas became more popular and Israel give it legitimacy.  If Israel went to occupy Gaza, the elite Israeli solders has been unable enter few meters into Gaza.  If Israel went to Gaza to show that they are the upper hand, the war has ceased when the resistance decided, not when Israel decided.  If Israel went to Gaza to kill Hamas leaders, Israel killed two out of five hundred leaders in the movement. If Israel went to Gaza to win the sympathy of the world, the war has turned the global public opinion against Israel.  I think the Palestinians are having the full right to celebrate this grate victory.|`|wdyf1sueaa	Isreael hoped to achieve its goal of quiet for southern Israel by destroying as much of Hamas' military infrastructure as possible, preventing it from being replaced and creating a new deterrent equation to make Hamas think twice before again provoking Israel.

But the Palestinians have 16 to 26 children per family. The Palestinians have a population growth rate above 3 percent. It would seem the Israelis are not very good at genocide. A single one of Israel's nuclear warheads, on the other hand, would have solved the problem very nicely.    Hamas's rocket firing has almost completely stopped. Now any single rocket that is fired into Israel is answered with blitz airstrikes and artillery shells. Disproportionate force has been criticized but has also worked. Life in southern Israel is returning to normal again.    Hamas is still under a heavy blockade. Nothing can go through. Small amounts of weapons have been smuggled through the Egyptian border, but the IDF continues to bomb the tunnels as well. Today Hamas representatives were stopped at the border with suitcases full of millions of dollars in cash, and a Lebanese "aid ship" carrying food and medicine and not surprisingly, AK47s, was intercepted by the navy.     This war has been a catastrophe for the Palestinians in every sense but the moral one. They simply survived - Israel only failed in overthrowing the government completely and reoccupying Gaza, and this was because of the early stoppage of the offensive because of Obama's inaugration, something that Netanyahu has criticized sharply. Israel's ability and readiness to defend itself has been firmly reestablished. Didn't you notice that Hezbollah refused to help Hamas, even though it has rockets that could hit very faraway Israeli cities? It was afraid of another Israeli show of force like in 2006. Only 3 rockets were fired from Lebanon, and were answered with heavy artillery. Now Hamas is denying responsibility for the few rocket attacks that have occurred from Gaza so far. It says it's the other Palestinian militant factions - and you know what, I believe them. Hamas isn't going to bother Israel again for a long time.|`|dirIBdToaa	No wiener here :)|`|oEVON0Xxaa	Hamas: "We will fight until the last drop of blood." "We will fight for every inch of land."

0xdKGMX7aa	I lived in France for 4 years and was delighted to find the amount of stuff that schools and parents do with the children there.     One is cycling. Children are taught at a young age to cycle and read road signs and follow maps. Schools take them on orienteering days. It's great fun.     They are also taught to ski and are taken for 2 weeks when very young to the nearest mountain range at christmas time. At the same time they are taken to learn about historical buildings, castles etc.    Treasure hunting is another activity which includes historical points of interest as well as plants, animals etc. They also do things that will involve cooking national dishes or local produce.|`|r3QbyYSSaa	Here's a link to a great site, Circle Time Kids, that has lots and lots of activities to learn all about the French culture.    http://www.circletimekids.com/WorldLibra...

jLTDqVHsaa	In the US, the wages of such workers are very low, often under what would otherwise be minimum wage.  If there was no tipping, the base wages would have to be higher for them, so guaranteed income would be higher, no matter how bad the service was.    In general, it's understood that you tip a certain rate (roughly 15% in a restaurant, for example) for regular service.  That way, if service is bad, you have the ability to go DOWN from what's standard.  Again, you only do this if service is indeed truly bad.  This leaves the worker with a resulting hour or two of less than minimum wage for his or her lack of effort.    To compensate for the apparent jump in cost caused by that "normal" 15% tip, you'll see lower prices when compared to places where there is no tipping; the net effect is that the total amount you pay (bill plus tip) for normal service is roughly the same as what you pay in places where you don't tip.    So, having the understanding of a "standard" tip of 15% or so ensures that the worker does adequate work to make sure that he or she does indeed earn that tip, because if the work is bad, the tip goes down or disappears.    Of course, if service is exceptional, feel free to raise that tip a bit.    EDIT: Sure, I see where you're coming from, it's a cultural nuance that differs from what you're used to.  What I like about this system is that it creates additional motivation for the workers to make sure they're earning the money.  The potential drawback is either lack of awareness about the custom or people simply being cheap, refusing to add (or skimping on) money that is not actually required, even if the service was just fine.  Each system has its good and bad side.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Waiters and waitresses in the US often work for minimum wage, which isn't a living wage.  They depend on tips as part of their income.  They wouldn't be able to pay their rent without them.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	It can mean that they might want to help them because of the fact that they are being payed minimum wage.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	it is supposed to reward a service job that is well done, and positive motivation for future visits. And maybe if you return they won't spit in your food|`|xiB1BPwsaa	Oh well, I'm sure American's would find some things Aussies do that is odd.    Don't be an ugly tourist.    As they say, when in Rome......|`|TUNvbXbgaa	some men and women in the who work in restaurants make less than  minimum  wage and they rely on the tips . if it weren't for tips my son would not be able to make his car payments he only works 3 nights a week as a bar backer and goes to college.   here is they do good services and you tip good then the next time you go in the services will be better.

fM7CwTwzaa	Oh, sure.    While *any* resort area will have the possibility of college students, the big "party central" resort areas will be Cancun, Mazatlan, and Acapulco.    Even in those places, it's not that hard to avoid the college partiers: you just stick to a more upscale hotel that's beyond the budget of the typical 20-year old (like the Ritz-Carlton, the Fiesta Americana Coral Beach, etc.)    Some good places that are more family friendly and definitely NOT college partier focused would be resort areas like Ixtapa, Manzanillo, and Huatulco. Ixtapa could be especially good since it's American-tourist focused, but not partier oriented. The Club Med Ixtapa is one resort that gets especially high marks for its kids program.    Good luck!|`|x8ESnc1iaa	The better idea is going to Manzanillo, Colima, es very pacefull and very familiar. Hotel Las Hadas     Av. Vista Hermosa s/n, Fracc. Pennsula de Santiago.

wVsjgj35aa	Officially or unofficially? Officially they want only to stop the kassem rockets,nothing more. Unofficially they wish to exploit it as a captive market while slowly eroding the demographic baseline with periodic attacks and closures in the hope the population will rapidly decline they can then reclaim it since they consider it part of their "inheritance" ; i.e. God-promised land.|`|Ac3UkTXYaa	Kill them all seems to be the only policy they have.|`|q7p2LnAiaa	israel's policy:    Kill, kill, kill, then say it was for self defense|`|wVNwoEfCaa	I agree with Zeno.  The Palestinians are a captive market, that is for sure.  The Israeli's use weapons that cause infertility and deformity.  They purposely target children, because Israel and the Palestinians both know that they are the future of Palestine.  It has been the policy of Palestinians to have as many children as they can, to grow their population, which is a form of protection for them.    They Israeli's make conditions so bad that it has begun to have effects on the growth of children, because of malnourishment.  It is obvious they are trying to diminish the population to thwart the tactic of the Arabs who wish to outnumber the Israeli's (it is harder to justify moving out millions of Arabs than just a few thousand).  Now they are not even allowing them the materials to rebuild, which has a devastating psychological effect, resulting in loss of hope.  The reason?  The Israeli's  want to kill off, or make the people leave, so they can take over the land.  Gaza is getting smaller and smaller.  They claim they moved the settlements for peace, but that isn't true, they wanted them out of the line of fire.  The policy is exactly as Zeno stated, and anyone who tells the truth will admit it.  Don't expect the Zionists or Israeli's to admit it though, because they have stated here themselves that lie and deny is the only way to protect Israel.  Only say the good, and any criticism you should keep to yourself, or only voice in private to other Zionists and Israeli's, never to any outsiders.   http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  Look at this link to a question, and the advice given to the poster about criticising the Israeli governments actions.  Proves my point all the way.    So, you might get as Zeno says, an 'official' policy, but you can take that as an outright lie.  Israel's policy on the Arab population has been and always will be ethnic cleansing.  @ Lupines  Yes indeed, drop the snotty attitudes, and bow to the masters right?  Aren't they acting slave like enough for you or something?  That statement reminds me of how the Germans used to treat the Jews, saying they acted all 'high and mighty' and believed they were better than everyone else.  This was while they were in camps, and ghettos, just like the Palestinians are now, and you expect gratitude and humility?|`|i7oHTo9haa	Palestinians really just need to drop the violence (and the snotty attitudes would be most helpful too if one actually does want peace.)    The Palestinians were offered Gaza as a land for peace deal, but Israel never got the peace.  Israel pulled crying citizens out of homes in Gush Katif to make room for them. Palestinians sent rockets from Gush Katif.  Israel left greenhouses for them to grow food, and would have provided them jobs, but they immediately dismantled them.     The Palestinians have a chance to make their skyscraper in Gaza on prime real estate, beach front property on the Med Sea.  But instead, they dismantled the greenhouses and made a series of THOUSANDS of tunnels like some strange underground society.  They smuggled in weapons and stuff for black market trade. They tortured, murdered and abused each other and threaten to annihilate Israel.  That behavior is way out of the spectrum of societal norms.    It just isn't really that difficult, they just need to denounce the violence. Israel is still waiting for that peace. Until the time that peace happens Israel takes a strong defensive strategy when under physical attack.    Israel made a thriving nation. Tel Aviv was built from scratch on a sand dune.Jerusalem is known as the City that David built. Making a skyscraper in Gaza in modern times really isn't that hard but it's next to impossible when one devotes their whole effort to smuggling in weapons in thousands of underground tunnels.  They really just need to denounce the violence.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	newsflash Israel left Gaza in 2005|`|zy8mKJxeaa	Israel's policy in regards to Gaza is that the extremist Hamas stop firing rockets against Israeli civilians. Given that Hamas' objective is the extermination of Israel and the entire Jewish people worldwide, they are not too friendly a group and not model neighbors. If in doubt. please read the Hamas charter. It reads like Nazi documents from Germany during WWII.|`|xBfPUGqyaa	their policy is to trap the citizens of gaza in a 4 hundred thousand man cage, deprive them of the basic necessities of life (food, water, rations) and if they try to resist, bomb as many as possible all in the name of self defense      by the way, if you dont agree with the policy, then why are you pro israel?
hWsNrDNUaa	treasure island!  it's cheap and it's right between two major cities (of course San Francisco being one of them).  It's easily accessible by car or by public transit.  rent is ridiculously cheap and there are no water or electricity bills to pay since the houses don't have meters.  if you could find someone renting a room it's REALLY cheap (as low as just a couple hundred) but that means roomies.  if you're looking to live alone, you could always opt for one of the smaller units!

usA4AGQDaa	The East Caribbean dollar (sign: $; code: XCD) is the currency of eight of the nine members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. It has existed since 1965 and is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $ or, alternatively, EC$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. The EC$ is subdivided into 100 cents. It has been pegged to the United States dollar at US$1 = EC$2.7 since 1976.    Six of the states using the EC$ are independent states: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The other two are British overseas territories: Anguilla and Montserrat. These states are all members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union. The only OECS member not using the East Caribbean dollar as their de facto currency is the British Virgin Islands, which uses the U.S. dollar instead.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	well you find people us US$ more than anything else or EC$ as well.    =]|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Although the Eastern Caribbean uses their own dollar it is best for you to shop with US.

e2e426c7412c57bd7f104afda806b223aa	Please do your research before buying any tailored pants or shirts in Bangkok. There are lots of places that will charge a lot for what you get. Sorry I can't find the website now but it may have been on the tripadvisor Forum. Basically it was a checklist of different things to look for and buy when you order tailored shirt/suit in Bangkok. They were saying things like buy some mother of pearl buttons and give them to the tailor to sew into the shirts because if you don't they'll just use the cheap plastic buttons. Another hint is to double the fabric layer on the cuffs (of the shirt) because it looks better than single layer. Many buyers fail to tell the tailor this important information and the tailor simply makes it single layer which cuts down on cost and doesn't look as nice. There were many more hints but I cannot remember the rest, you'll have to look it up.    I've never heard of Jasal Tailors, it sounds like it maybe next to Jas3 Hotel or Jas Restaurant near Sukumvhit Soi 1/3 but I could be wrong.

IovaFHHqaa	- March is still low-season. However, during weekends most of the (better) hotels and hostels are fully booked. When arriving on friday or saturday without a reservation, you might have little choice.    - During the week there will be plenty of vacancies. The Tourist Office in front of the Central Station can book you a last-minute room/bed.     - Besides the advantage of being free to come and go whenever you want, you might even be able to bargain a little discount as a last-minute walk-in. A 15-20% discount is not unusual.     Have a good stay! Greetings from Amsterdam|`|LA5VwAvIaa	At least reserve a  cheap hostel that requires little or no money to hold and will not charge if you dont show.

3fHZOobiaa	Unluckily Italy has got many prejudices about all the Balkans, Croatia included, in fact the Balkans are seen as a unique place with the same culture and people... Many times there is the prejudice that they are all clandestine, that they come to Italy because there, they can easily break the law ( at present, Italian judicial system is very weak), or in other cases, that they "steal the job" to Italians... I think that, in general, there is a lot of ignorance among Italians about this argument and surely the media don't help to fight against stereotypes, on the contrary, many times, they feed them...  Especially in this period there is a lot of tensions about this subject, people seem more intolerant than in the previous years and even in politics the circumstances are not very beautiful, in fact, after the last elections in 2008, the coalition which won was made up of PDL ( Berlusconi's party) and "Lega Nord" famous for being racist, for example it introduced the crime of  "clandestine immigration" and some days ago the possibility for doctors to denounce clandestine people who need cures!    I hope the things will get better in a close future...    However, don't generalize, not all the Italians are in this way...|`|xegK7yhiaa	uuuhhh. no really. kind of random.

Fnp2MIycaa	Here in Australia we have (what I consider) the countryside, also known as the bush, which is the (usually, but not for quite some time during this drought) lush farming areas.   (Grain, cotton, rice, grapes for wine, stone fruit, apples, potatoes, salad vegetables, dairy farms etc.)   Some of these country areas are the Darling Downs, Granite Belt and Lockyer Valley in Queensland, the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area of NSW and the High Country in Victoria.    Then, there is the Outback which is wide, flat, dry, land further inland and on to the centre of Australia. The enormous cattle and sheep stations (ranches) are in the Outback. The largest cattle station is in South Australia. It's called Anna Creek Station and covers an area of 34000 sq. kms (6 million acres). If you want to see pictures and see just how flat and dry and dusty it is click the blue link: http://www.wrightsair.com.au/anna.htm    I've lived in a small country town (8000 people) and loved it. I suppose it was like any country town anywhere in the world.   Everyone knew everyone else and everyone else's business but it was a great life.   The local farmers would come to town for the pig and cattle sales once a week. Kids travelled in by bus from the outlying farms for school each day.   We had numerous small shops, butcher, newsagent, chemist, grocery shop, the stock and station agent, real estate agent, post office, electrical goods shop, a couple of cafes that also did take-away fish and chips and hamburgers etc. At one time the town had a picture theatre but that was before my time.  Yes all up it was a friendly, relaxed and lovely little town.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Not me But I've spent a lot of time there and in Australia the countryside or The Out back or the Bush, or back of beyond is all different names for it.

Once you have kids and settle down you just can't pull off a trip like that.

Canada is a huge diverse country with lots to see and do and I'm sure you will enjoy yourself.  Also, Canada is pretty safe compared to some other countries and that is an important consideration, especially if you're traveling by yourself.

Good luck! :)|`|EOZsYlZkaa	If you will be 18 and have $9,000, then you will have a great start. You  can enter the country for 6 months on a tourist visa. Of course, immigration and customs will want to know HOW you managed to save $9,000, so make sure you have a good story. Don't bring in any thing above $10,000, because then you will have many, many questions to answer. If you're resourceful enough to have saved $9,000, then you are mature enough to tell your parents.  How far will $9,000 get you in Canada? Well, it's a BIG country. Since you will be too young to rent a car, then you will have to fly to various destinations. And that's expensive. Decide on an itinerary and check back.|`|wCaFESnfaa	You should just tell your parents or friends or whoever, and go! Go explore, its not crazy. You have obviously put a lot of thought and planning into this. It takes a long time to get 9,000 lol. Promise your parents that you will go straight to college as soon as you get back. They are right about you needing to go right away, but you could apply to a college for the winter semester which usually starts in November or at least here it does.

CyP7VMHHaa	Airlines normally don't issue paper tickets and mail them anymore. You will have an "e-ticket." It is electronic and exists only in the airline's computer.  They will e-mail you a confirmation with your itinerary and a confirmation number.    When you go to the airport, just give a ticket agent your confirmation number or your flight number. Or, you can check yourself in using an automated kiosk. Better yet, you can check yourself in from home. Just go to the airline's website within 24 hours of departure. Look for the check-in link. Follow the instructions and print your own boarding passes. Then, just go to the airport, check your luggage, and go to security. It's easy.    Yes, it will still be in the computer when you return. Check-in works the same way as on your outbound flight.

Therefore, in that case, wouldn't they be African and not African American?    Furthermore, this is the Orlando section, why are you asking this question, which is about an attraction in Anaheim, CA here?    And also, there will be Disney characters added to the attraction, no one has mentioned anything about removing characters.    Why do you look for racism where racism doesn't exist?    I suggest you take your political rant elsewhere.    Have a magical day.|`|5YY3D2cYaa	Are you saying that there are or are not african american disney movies or characters?  I am confused if you didn't spell something right or am just a little confused yourself.  There is a black Princess coming this year (winter i think) the Princess and the Frog.  Also i strongly agree with the other answers because Racism is not Everywhere you look.  You can try and make it up and blow it out of proportion but its just not always really racism.  Stop trying to be grown up and look at the ride like a child.
VxfyQZ2jaa	The first answer is exactly correct.    This is an incomplete guide to bars & clubs:    http://www.neworleanscheapdrinks.com/    For clubs, the bands change so you have to check the listings: Go to www.bestofneworleans.com and click on Music then Listings or to www.offbeat.com and click on Listings, then Music.     Note that music clubs often advertise "No Cover", meaning there is no charge for entering. However, clubs with "No Cover" often require that customers buy a beverage (doesn't have to be alcohol) each for every "set " of music (which can be every 20 minutes) so KNOW THE PRICE before you sit down. Clubs do that because some people will sit in the club all evening drinking nothing (clubs only make money from the drinks they sell - not from the music). It is also a good idea to pay for each round of drinks (in clubs on Bourbon Street) as it is delivered so there can't be any confusion at the end of the evening.    About certain alcoholic beverages: Realize that some famous drinks are VERY potent compared with regular cocktails that have only 1 to 1 ? ounces of alcohol. For example, a Hurricane is basically 3 or 4 ounces of rum in something like red Kool-Aid, and a Hand Grenade has at least 4 ? ounces of Everclear + rum + vodka mixed with melon liquor. They dont necessarily taste like an alcoholic beverage and it is easy to over-indulge.    Hope you have a great time!|`|IezA7SGSaa	some bars are open 24 hours.    some close when the last customer leaves.    at Pat O's we drank till the sun came up and they only asked us to move to a different table so they could hose off the patio but they never closed.

0ZfZulnzaa	Its approx 1300 kms from Winnipeg to Edmonton via the Yellowhead  16, but you have a lot of small towns and lower speed limits as well as it just a single lane highway for most of the way from the turnoff to the 16 until Saskatoon.    Going via the TransCanada to Regina and then up to Saskatoon and then on to Edmonton is about 1350 kms, the highway is twinned most of the way to Edmonton, speed limit is 110 kms.    Regardless of which way you choose you will lose time going through Saskatoon and Lloydminster. So depending on your stops, your driving speed, weather and time it takes to go through the towns and cities you are looking at anywhere from 15 hrs to 17 hrs.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I made it from Brandon to Edmonton in one real long day of driving.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Well...where in Manitoba?

ejujoezgaa	Have you considered the Cedar Point Resort in Sandusky, Ohio, the Lake Erie Islands, and the larger Lake Erie region in the summer, when it's warm?  From Sandusky, much of the region could be visited by day trips, if you preferred.    http://www.lake-erie.com/    E.g., Put-in-Bay offers caves to explore, charter fishing or learn-to-fish opportunities, kayaking, jet skiing, parasailing, gem stone sluicing, maze running, great biking, some important American history, and more:    http://put-in-bay.com/attractions.html g...    http://www.nps.gov/pevi/    Of course, Cedar Point is the world's best amusement park, roller coaster capital of the world, features the beach where the football forward pass was perfected and water parks.  Other great water parks also are located in the Sandusky area.    You could go to a Mud Hens game in Toledo, or an Indians game at Progressive Field in Cleveland, just over an hour east of Sandusky.      Cleveland also offers in its harbor the U.S.S. Cod, the only remaining intact WWII submarine, which many teens find a very memorable adventure.  Cleveland also has an iron ore freighter that can be toured, the Great Lakes Science Museum, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame & Museum, all within walking distance.  The Cleveland Art Museum is one of the nation's best museums (kids of all ages love the armor court) and there is no admission charge, so there is no guilt in leaving quickly.  The nearby natural history museum has an excellent planetarium.    Cleveland also has the second largest performing arts center in the U.S., where you could attend a performance of Disney's "Mary Poppins" or some other event this summer.    http://www.playhousesquare.com/Events/Ev...    Similarly, the Blossom Festival likely will offer some attraction that will entertain your family, from rock concerts to some of the best classical music in the world.    http://www.clevelandorchestra.com/html/B...    http://www.clevelandorchestra.com/html/B...    Blossom, which can accommodate over 18,000 listeners, is the summer home of the Cleveland Orchestra, ranked seventh in the world.    If you want to expand your trip, you could visit Niagara Falls, which especially is attractive this year with the Canadian dollar much weaker against the greenback than in recent years.  Not only can you approach the falls on the "Maid of the Mist," you can take jet boats up the powerful Niagara River!    Presque Isle, Pennsylvania's "only seashore," near Erie offers some of the best freshwater beaches in the world (in August, Lake Erie's water temperature reaches into the high 70s).    And near Detroit is the famed Greenfield Village and Ford Rouge Factory Tour, both very unique experiences.|`|Xaw48PZ7aa	dollywood is fun.|`|HmZm1gbraa	Would you consider Martha's Vineyard ?   Not sure if you are looking for a trip soon, or in June- Aug.    It's close to Pennslyvania and is relaxing for adults and has some adventurous things for teens.    The luxurious Winnetu Oceanside Resort at South Beach, Edgartown has alot of activities on their property...pools, tennis, teen programs, yoga, fitness center, outdoor ping-pong, beach activities and more.    Edgartown has Mad Max catamaran sailing tours, deep sea fishing, boat rentals, great restaurants etc.    Oak Bluffs has arcades, movies, tourist shops.

UE1evlTlaa	Yes! They are actually really popular down here. You can wear them in a variety of different colors and they always look good with cute khaki or navy colored shorts (think American Eagle or Abercrombie). They are light weight and perfect for walking around in the parks on a hot day.    You might want to bring a t-shirt with you just in case. The sun can get pretty brutal.

They sign up with the agency, then are offered assignments in different parts of the country , or sometimes in other countries.  The contracts are usually for 3 months at a time and can be extended sometimes.  An apt  is provided and the nurse works in a certain hospital, usually in a specialty unit  full time for the weeks she is there.  These nurses are well experienced in special fields, and well paid.  Usually they are required to have at least 2 to 3 years experience in nursing.   If they have special training and experience in emergency room, Intensive care, intensive care nursery, or other high tech areas, they are more in demand and have more choice of assignments.  See page  below for list of some of these agencies.|`|G80M8TJLaa	A travel nurse is a health care professional whose specialty is providing preventative health care for travelers.

The Israel of the Partition Plan in 1947? The Israel of the 1950 Truce Line? The Israel of the 1967 borders? Or the 1979 borders? Or the 1981 borders,after annexing the Golan? Which one?    He has a point. No other nation on earth is so decidedly unclear as to it's borders. On top of everything else they apparently think south Lebanon is soon-to-be-included.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Israel consists of land from the Jordan river, up to Lebanon border and down to Egypt border.  There was no transfer of land with Palestinians and there never was a Palestinian state.  Israel offered the section of land known as Gaza to Palestinians in a land for peace deal, the land was offered but there was no peace. There was hope they'd make their skyscraper on prime beach front real estate, but instead they made some strange undergound society. The West Bank is an English name, means simply West Bank of Jordan river.  That is Judea (Judah tribe land) and the border on that has shifted during modern wars.  Religiously speaking that land can't change ownership out of Israel's hands, but the Palestinians can lease it for a shekel for 100 years if they like as long as they disarm.    Palestinians are actually Syrian orphans created for a political agenda against Israel. There are greater perspectives  than just the current conflict or any border shift.    "The Israelis can sue the Arabs now, and demand billions or even trillions in compensation for the damage caused them in 1948-1967. You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967. So the Israelis can ask: "Why did you fight us before that?" They will demand Arab compensation for the so-called embargo on Israel and for the economic damage caused to the Israelis. If the Israelis sue you, they will win. They will say: We suffered an injustice. We are like an innocent lamb surrounded by wolves. We've been saying this since 1948."  Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...    "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."    "We all know the Israeli aggression will not be without consequences.We all know our people have been oppressed by the Israeli occupation, but that doesn't mean we don't have a right to live in a land we migrated to and settled in." Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas PM, 03 Feb 2009 Al-Aqsa TV    "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it." - Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937  "There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not."  - Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946  "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria." - Rep. of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956  Concerning the Holy Land, the chairman of the Syrian Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in February 1919 stated: "The only Arab domination since the Conquest in the year 635 hardly lasted, as such, 22 years."|`|nHuMeLtyaa	The "fence" in the West Bank is now the border.|`|oEVON0Xxaa	Well, considering theres no such thing as Palestine, Israel's borders vary. In 1948, the UN partitioned the land, 1 for Jews 1 for Palestinians, the Jews accepted the plan, the Palestinians didn't. After the Jews accepted, the Arabs attacked Israel and since "Palestine" wasn't a sovereign nation, Israel had the right to take the land since it didn't belong to any nation. In 1967, the Arabs again attacked Israel and Israel won gaining control of the West Bank and Gaza and again, those areas are not under a nation so the land doesn't belong to anyone.|`|1RXOjaryaa	Yes, Israel is expanding as they go about conquering the world - run for your life! ... whatever.    The borders haven't changed since Israel was established at the end of WW2.     By the way, where are the borders of Palestine (since there has never been a nation of Palestine ever in history)?|`|mXCDJ9jYaa	After 60 years it's still completely up in the air. Are they going to get out of the Palestinian Territories or not? Are they they going to return the Golan or what? If you look at a map of what claims to be this country you get different borders about every ten years. A shape-shifter it is.

JQa86WoVaa	I've been there plenty of times and I was exactly where you are at right now, my first time. It isn't so different, especially since you are going on a missions trip and not by yourself. 1) First of all, don't walk anywhere alone, but especially at night (I did this in Antigua and got robbed, not harm done just some money stolen).2) Depending on where you go, it will be warm, remember that. In Antigua or other places close to the city, it can get a little chilly at night. Bring a sweatshirt or a light jacket but it won't get that cold. 3) I don't know if this applies but, women there dress a lot more conservatively, think about it. While short shorts won't get you in trouble or anything, you will look much more respectable with pants or at least clam diggers. 4) Bring an umbrella and a water proof jacket!! 5) Bring extra cash for cool souveniors (paintings, bright cloth, handmade trinkets etc.) 6) As I'm sure you know, don't drink the water but more so, don't eat the ice. Ask for your drinks sin hielo (without ice). most places don't serve ice anyhow but unless you are in a very nice resort type place they use tap water to make the ice and you could get sick (i did) 7) Bring lots of meds (tylenol, beano, pepto bismol etc) Not to jinx you but I get sick at least once everytime I go. 8) Bring toilet paper. A lot of public bathrooms(if you can find one) or even bathrooms in restaurants and gas stations don't have toilet paper (hard to believe but I learned the hard way!).     That's all I can think of right now. I'm sure you'll be fine and have a great time. Don't worry, it's a lot safer now than it has been in the past. People look our for tourists. Hopefully you will make it to Antigua, Lake Atitlan, and Vulcan Pacaya (Pacaya Volcano). Anyway, sorry so long.

WHAT EVER YOU DO DO NOT EAT FRUIT SOLD IN THE STREET, try not to eat cheese, cream or milk if it is not a fancy or nice restaurant try to avoid things sold in the street (hot dogs are ok). If you keep this in mind you will probably wont get sick.    Enjoy Guatemala is beautiful.      Oh and don't carry all your cash at the same time, if you most then place it in different pockets, so if you gte robbed they won't take it all.

JnXmSLDfaa	I went through a time of being also just terrified to fly, each trip was overshadowed by knowing that I had to fly to get back home,  It was horrible and I knew I wasn't being reasonable.      I went to a psychiatrist and learned a lot about sublimation's and I also learned how to conquer my fears of flying.  I took valium before my flights and when I was a passenger, I also had a drink, so that I was so relaxed that I just was and I enjoyed myself, even took naps and smiled at the clear air turbulence.      After a few trips like that, it wasn't necessary for me to take valium any longer .  If you have a doctor who will work with you, don't hesitate to ask him. It doesn't help you emotionally even if you know intellectually that you are safer in an airplane than in an auto many times over per passenger mile.  It just doesn't help, it didn't me anyway.  How they stay up isn't important to you unless you are a physicist.  Those engines are so powerful you'd be so amazed, well, we all are, because we can fly with them.      I love it, I love to fly, I love lift-off and V 2.  The feel of those powerful engines that pull us up into the clouds, I love it.       Take some valium.  It's a long flight to China, you want to enjoy it.

EWE2RJoJaa	donty waste your time using the buses. I used to do the buses until I discovered renting a car was easier, cheaper and better. Driving is a lot easier in Cancun then NYC or Miami.    By the time you pay r/t airport transfer and a few bus rides etc, especially if you go out of the hotel zone it will cost a lot more then renting a car.    The links to info and car rentals places are below in source section. Hvae fun!     Rental cars offer a convenient way to visit historic points outside the city at very reasonable prices. One of our personal favorites is E-Z Rent a Car. Another one of our personal favorites is Ace Rent a Car. They both have car rentals from $5 per day. Both of these places use Executive Rent A Car in Cancun, so not matter which one you rent from you will pick up the car at Executive, so go with which one is cheaper. Be advised liability insurance is mandatory with a car rental in Mexico at a cost of $11 per day. With tax and mandatory liability expect a little under $20 a day.    Do not take the collision insurance. Your major credit card will cover collission (check with your card company prior to departure). But most major credit cards will provide collision insurance for no charge.    Also both of these places take reservations online without the need of a credit card to make the reservation. I always take the cheapest car as you pretty much are guaranteed an upgrade at no additional cost. Also I suggest making your reservations and then check back often and especially a few days before you go check the rates again as they usually go down within a few days from departure. Then if rates are cheaper cancel existing reservation and make a new one.|`|nEgJAtK7aa	If you are staying in the hotel zone you can ride the public transportation for about 60 cents. That is what we used. We took a cab once I think it was $5. The bus was really easy to use and we told the bus driver where we wanted to go and he let us know when we needed to get off. Have fun in Cancun.|`|m7DU6i6jaa	don't waste your time renting a car in cancun.  There is no need for it and if you aren't from there it's very hard to drive in the hotel zone of cancun.  the taxi cabs and buses will run you over.  Also there isn't really that much parking for when you do drive and go somewhere.    stick with the bus system.  it's VERY cheap and they run a five min. schedule, meaning every five mins.. there is a bus at the stops so you will never wait long for one.  stay away from taxi's unless you absolutely have to take one.  there is no set fee and they can charge you as they please.|`|xztT6WYDaa	Dont know how much it is to hire a car.    It depends where you want to go.    Cancun is very well served by buses    They run an exceptional service and they run throughout the night as well and they are very cheap.    We used them  all the time when we were there in December.    Have a great time.  We did.|`|ZsLHITEYaa	I'm from cancun. If you plan to stay in the hotel zone and the city, the bus will do. taxis are very expensive.   If you plan to visit the riviera maya than definately a car would be better.

Russia Became the largest "Country", more accurately the largest empire during the reign of Peter the Great (1682-1735)  He further expanded the Empire bringing Siberia into the Russian Realm as well as the Caucasus's and the Crimean In the south.  During Peters reign Kiev ceceded from the Ausro-Hungarian Empire? and joined the Russian.  Under Peter the great, Russa became the largest empire stretching an enormous 3 billion acres.         Answering your question "When did russia become the biggest" would be hard.  There is no exact date.  Russia became the largest under Peter the Great.  His reign was from 1682-1735.  Thats what i would put if asked that question on any test.|`|z4Yrn96Paa	As Ilya points out, this is hard because there was no single date in history when Russian woke up one morning and decided to expand.

fukzl8oaaa	Chicago is a nice city but Paris is one of the greatest in the world...  Visit both and you will understand.|`|DQiZ2pA7aa	From what I've seen, cities in Europe seem to be more culture-filled than those in the US.  Although I haven't been to Chicago, I like Paris a lot more than any city I've ever been to in the US.  One of the first things I noticed was how different the buildings are.  I don't really think you can compare the two though.
KPFOlwwaaa	...|`|1ppBxxV9aa	The cheapest place in that area is the back side of queen Anne, along Nickerson St. (very close to your school actually). It's a touch ghetto in some parts, but not bad at all. The further you go into Fremont, Queen Anne, or Lake Union, the higher the rents get. You could also look into Ballard. I'm not sure of the prices there these days. Although, there are tons of condos going up right now.|`|pgFD4n1Caa	I would probably say that you could find some really cheap studios on the topof Queen Anne because they have a huge amount of apartments and condos but this is a fairly pricey neighborhood range that you are looking at. There are few cheaper rentals in Ballard but you would really have to look.  Be specific in your price range. Cheap to you may be 600 bucks. Cheap to these neighborhoods for a 1 bedroom would be around 700 - 1000 even higher|`|JOoqy9doaa	I bet capitol hill would be cheaper but its farther away than queen anne. i would suggest University district as well, as there will be a larger number of student housing units available.
9ko5WUFkaa	Yeah - you can still line up for tickets.  Just get there early and you won't have to wait too long.  I was there a couple of months ago and went early - the wait wasn't more than 10 minutes.|`|Dn63VUsVaa	You don't even have to get there early - since the Vatican begin its new reservation system (combined with the tourism crisis), lines are basically a thing of the past.

AA12068233	Im gonna tell you straight up things to do in Atlanta if youre under 21 are very, very limited. Youre gonna be stuck with Six Flags, Hawks/Thrashers/Braves games, The Coke Museum, the Aquarium and so forth. Shopping wise, Lenox and Phipps Plaza are malls you will want to check out. Lots of very expensive high end stuff there.    I havent stayed in a hotel there in forever but I would call each one of the Courtyard Marriott in the area and see what they rates are. The Doubletree in Buckhead is also nice and safe, 3 star hotel and shouldnt be too expensive.     I haven't heard of any condos you can rent for just the weekend or anything like that.     Now, if you can ditch those under 21 your options are limitless.|`|AEAS7A9naa	There is also St. Mountain but that's a bit farther away from 'Atlanta'. Like 20 min or so away. It is essentially a big rock with carvings which you can climb. There's a mimi park around it and a pretty cool laser show at night.   Robin|`|a0v3q3J4aa	Remember that 6 Flags is closed this time of year.   It doesn't open again until April|`|1bUkmPt9aa	We stayed at the Hyatt Place in Alpharetta for under 60 bucks a night.

Make an appointment bring proof of travel e.g itinerary. Get there early like when it opens line get extremely long get everything they tell you to and it should cost about $167 because it's rush they will tell to either come back the same day or come back 2 or 3 day's later. But you can get it if you can prove that you are traveling soon. Do not go through companies they can get it for you but they charge about $200 in addition to the passport fee.

If you are thinking traditional art, as in the sort that finds it's way into galleries, then it doesn't matter about the state more about the city. Major cities, especially those with a large number of galleries and museums, are where you want to be.    Commercial work, well just go where your industry is.    General rule of thumb is east or west coast, north is better than south.

z6TaVFjOaa	You can also take a Southwest train to Salisbury (8 miles from Stonehenge) from London Waterloo station... then take a tour bus from the Salisbury station.  Just a thought.    Train:  http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/    Bus:  http://www.londontoolkit.com/whattodo/st...   -or-  http://www.wdbus.co.uk/things-to-do/tour...|`|8WqTvPBbaa	I have family in London and when I visited and asked about Stonehenge they said it wasn't worth it because you had to drive though London which is a nightmare and then it takes 2 hours to get there and when you get their a fence is around Stonehenge so you don't even get to touch it or get up close. The traffic is terrible in London its 10 times worse than any traffic I have every seem it just seems like more of a pain than anything.|`|WEIzcER6aa	I did once but we used it more than for the one trip and it was sooo worth it the country side is beautiful and there are really funny signs along the way. It was amazing and I loved every minute of it!|`|LfL9RbiGaa	Yes go for it, Stonehenge is magical and the country side is beautiful!|`|Di7zRKEIaa	If you leave London very early the advantage of having a car when you visit Stonehenge is considerable. Not only can you see Stonehenge, but also the surrounding countryside, which is really interesting (many more ancient sites to see, also good pubs -try  the  Bustard Inn, Shrewton). The best thing would be to arrange yourself a 'special access' visit (where you get inside the Stone Circle) either very early morning, or evening - check the times and prices on the English Heritage website below. (also included below - some really interesting new Stonehenge websites),|`|ZZCgOQfKaa	Yes and no. Firstly you will not see much if renting the car your eyes will be on the road. Second add in Salisbury or Bath on your trip as the journey down the A36 to Bath shows some stunning valley views (Its also the faster way in to Bath.) Most people in my experience (17 Years of visits! ) Stay for a maximum of 30 Minutes. This is a lot of travel for such a momentous trip. The village of Thruxton on the way from London has a nice selection of Thatched homes and will look delightful to anyone wanting to see the quintessential English village (Scottish and Welsh villages have a Lovely charm and style of their own hence the demarcation.) Your alternative would be to consider a bus tour from London this avoiding the driving and seeing more. The cost will normally include access and also cover other destinations.) This will save the stress of Driving on foreign roads too.|`|Clotp6jQaa	If you do rent a car, there's a lot to see in the area besides Stonehenge:    - Avebury (another stone circle, very different but very impressive)    - Old Sarum ('old Salisbury' - a hill fort dating back to the iron age)    - Heale House Gardens - a country house garden in the Avon Valley between Stonehenge and Salisbury    On the other hand, Salisbury train station is fairly central, and buses run direct from there to 'the Stones'.     Also, even without a car, there's plenty to see and do in Salisbury itself, including:    - the Cathedral    - the Magna Carta    - the museum (especially for the Giant and 'Hobnob')    - a load of pubs (I'd especially recommend the 'Haunch of Venison', near the Poultry Cross)    ...and I think in terms of 'experiencing England', or, at least, one aspect of England, just mooching around Salisbury is a good idea!    Hope this helps  Matt

nF9DZ0sOaa	Up the I-35 corridor there are any number of things to see and do.  Not knowing your interests, it would be tough to know exactly what sort of things you like, but here are a few suggestions:    The Snake Farm (never been there, but my daughter & family have.  She says it's very...snaky.)    Natural Bridge Wildlife Ranch and Caverns.    Landa Park in New Braunfels...very nice park.    The Children's Museum in New Braunfels...exceptional!    Schlitterbahn...if you're going in the summer    Gruene...step back in time.    Wonder Cave    The Outlet Malls between New Braunfels & San Marcos    Aquarina Springs...now owned by the college.  The glass-bottomed boat rides are cool.    The Bob Bullock Museum in Austin is a wonderful place for everyone;  don't miss it!    A tour of the Texas State Capitol should be required for every citizen of the Lone Star State    In Waco is the Texas Ranger Museum.    In Corsicana is the fruitcake factory.  Not just fruitcake...lots of bakery goodies.    Of course, once you get to Dallas, you'll never run out of things to do, but if you have the opportunity to get over to the Fort Worth Zoo and to the Dallas botanical gardens, they are both very worth seeing!    Have a good trip!|`|q22ngVmkaa	I would recommend stopping in Austin and Houston, but only after touring the Riverwalk for a day or so. There is nothing in Dallas.

Cozumel has some good deals as well and it's not crazy like Cancun--and the beaches are gorgeous.  Cruises are slashing prices and you could probably get a decent cruise for a long weekend for far less than your budget.    I'd take a look at travel packages on the main travel sites like Orbitz or Travelocity.  If you want to do it piecemeal or compare prices, try Sidestep or Kayak.  Those will show the rock bottom prices on air and hotel.|`|OIhRjhbaaa	Palawan island, Philippines
AA12005775	Montmartre is my favorite place in Paris. You should definitely visit! You get an amazing view of Paris and the Sacre Coeur church is beautiful. I got some great "prints" of Paris as well (Like Le Chat Noir, Tour Eiffel, etc.) and this was the cheapest place I found to purchase them.     Just to warn you...in this area there are lots of tourist traps. People may come up to you and try to convince you to let them build a bracelet on your arm then make you pay for it. (This is at the bottom of the hill.) At the top of the hill, you will have people trying to paint your portrait. (This could work to your advantage if you wish to do so. You can definitely negociate the price.)     ...My best advice for dealing  with these people if you don't want to be bothered is to completely ignore them. DO NOT make eye contact. They may speak to you in English. Just ignore, ignore, ignore! (I tried politely refusing the first few times, but this got me nowhere!) One time ,there was one very persistent person who wouldn't leave me alone and I said in French "J'habite  Paris. Vous pouvez pas me laisser me promener tranquillement!?" (I live in Paris. You can't let me walk around in peace!?) and that did the trick...but if you don't speak French it's best to IGNORE!.|`|c158ee5146582ecc037e3dc9d2709399aa	Yes..depending on what U like! Arts,Artists, a good view over Paris, feeling the French atmosphere,..Easy to go there , like anywhere in Paris.Just take the Metro and then walk a very little!|`|DQiZ2pA7aa	Definitely.  I went there for about half a day and I loved it.  There are a lot of little shops there, but like someone mentioned before, there are some tourist traps.  But it's definitely worth the visit.  Have fun!|`|AA11937736	Montmartre is certainly worth a visit although I think all day would probably be too long in just a five day visit.     The main sights are Sacre Coeur, the view from the plaza in front of Sacre Coeur (probably the best in Paris), the Place du Tetre where various (mostly mediocre) artists display their work, the Lapin Agile (a bar where the artistic community used to hang out), the 2 moulins (windmills) which are the last of many that used to be in this area, the Vineyard of Montmartre and the Cemetary. I suspect you can cover all this in half a day.    Montmartre is quite easy to get to from central Paris and is just minutes on the Metro. The best way to approach Montmartre is by taking the Metro to the Anvers station then walking up the Avenue Steinkerque to the Funicular (a short inclined railway) that is part of the Paris public transport system and riding it up the hill (it costs one metro ticket to do so). From St. Michel in the 5th it would take about 15 minutes to make it to the Anvers Metro station.

dohhfGTfaa	A Eurail Pass can only be used over a 2 month period.  For travel over a year you'll need to buy individual tickets. But 2nd class travel in Europe is quite cheap and as a student you'll probably get an extra discount.    Also, Eurail Passes are only available from your home country.  You will not be able to buy one in Barcelona or anywhere else in Spain.    You might want to restrict weekend travel to Spain itself, there's certainly plenty to see, and Portugal and France, and visit Germany, Switzerland etc when you have a week or so to spare, as a train trip from Barcelona to these countries will take a full day each way.    EDIT:  Just realised I misread your question and you'll only be in Barcelona for a couple of months, so ignore the info about Eurail passes - sorry about that.  However, advice on distances still stands.  If you're travelling just within Spain you'll find the trains are very cheap and there is also a very good long-distance bus system.|`|OhhnWvjuaa	Go by train.  Reduce your carbon footprint :)|`|LA5VwAvIaa	some local airlines will be VERY cheap but not cheaper than a train.    since your traveling will be spread out over a year you will be better off buying individual tickets than a Pass.    the thing to think about is that it will take a full day (+) to travel by train (remember that mountain trains are much slower than the ICE high speed trains...) to most places and then the same to travel back.  Planes will be better for traveling 2 countries away or more.|`|809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	It depends on where and how much you want to travel. If you want to take a week at some point and do a grand tour of Europe a rail pass might make sense-- if you just want to get away for an occasional weekend, flying may make more sense. You can check the Eurrail web page--they have different types of tickets with different rules. In general though, especially if you're going on weekends, you'll spend a LOT of time on the train getting to Germany or Italy from Spain. Flying will be easier and while you can build up quite a tab on Ryanair or Easyjet if you're not careful, taking hours to get somewhere beats taking days.|`|0xdKGMX7aa	Adam J is right about travelling by air. Ryanair is cheap depending on the days you go. For example wednesday is a cheap day, friday, saturday and monday will be expensive because of business travelers. Also take a look at easyjet.     If you prefer the train, you may need to look carefully at the pass that takes you from country to country. If you are a student, I think you could get discount, also look at the hostels if you need somewhere to stay. There is a very good hostel clubs across europe. Some are family friendly and a lot of europeans travel this way. It's great fun.
g8JGLnk6aa	Both United Airlines and US Airways are part of an airline alliance called the Star Alliance. This means that they act as partners when it comes to things like connections and frequent flier miles. One airline handles one leg of the journey and another airline in the same alliance handles the other part.     You will most likely just check in once, at your home airport. This will check you all the way through to your final destination. Try checking in online one day before your trip, and if you hit any snags, just go to the check-in counter at the airport and they'll check you in.
UE1evlTlaa	There are no sort of "birthday discounts"....BUT, there are certain perks for having your birthday while dining at the parks.    If you decide to make reservations ahead of time, call and mention that it is your birthday. Disney is pulling out all the stops this year to make sure that your birthday is special. They won't give you discounts, BUT you can expect a free cupcake, specialized cakes (you can order ahead of time for around $20), and decorations for your table. Call the Disney dining line (To make a dining reservation call 407-WDW-DINE).    I celebrated my graduation at Narcoosi's last year and they really made my night special when I called ahead of time. They even decorated the top of the menus to say "Congratulations!" on the top and my dessert had Congratualtions written in cocoa powder on my plate. So, you can expect special touches like these. But you never know...if you wear your "I'm celebrating a Birthday" button (which you can receive from Guest Relations at any of the parks or at your hotel) you never know what will happen to you. People within the parks try to make your day extra special. Might get a free soda or ice cream out of it :) They love to make "magical moments" happen. I found this great page about the What Would You Celebrate Birthday campaign if you want to know more about what you can expect on your birthday too!|`|iWwjNuj9aa	Disney is continuing it's free admission for family members whose birthday it is...Details are available by visiting   www.disneyparks.com,     where you can register for your free ticket.

Also, if you want some great info on how to beat those long lines, how to save HUGE on Disney costs... even where to find the parks' "hidden entrances" and shortcuts and bypass most of the crowds, you should go to     http://tinyurl.com/disneysavings    ...this site's info comes direct from an ex Disney employee. She shows you how to save $200 on your park tickets alone and save $1,000's more on all your Disney holiday costs. And she's just put out a really useful Disney Savings & Tips Guide for 2009.    Enjoy!|`|eD7qRBKHaa	No, your free ticket is all.  That's worth $75, so that's a pretty nice gift!  You won't get any discounts on top of that.  However, if you stop at Guest Relations and pick up a free birthday button and wear it, some restaurants will bring you a free dessert sometimes.|`|pg5AHNcdaa	I doubt it. So many people go for their birthdays there.|`|PxMNxytjaa	I would say no and if so than not by much.|`|uxbPuDb0aa	No discounts other than the ticket your already getting a 75 dollar admission free you think they are going to give you anything else?  oh you`ll get a button saying its my birthday.  But that's all.|`|yKdKU03Waa	look online|`|AA11294734	Of course!    This is Disney's "What Will You Celebrate" year, and as part of the promotion you get free admission on your birthday!    It has to be the exact day of your birthday, and proof will be required.    Here is a website that explains it:    http://land.allears.net/blogs/dnews/2009...

The summers are hot all over the country, especially in inner China (away from the Pacific). The winters, it depends where you are. You'll need a coat in BJ, SH, and inner China, but not HK. The locals in HK wear coats in the winter anyway, but that's completely unnecessary and actually pretty silly. A jacket would be better for HK/Guangdong.|`|63d475248336603856ee558e1544bc58aa	It's summer in China the same time it's summer in the West.  The seasons are reversed south of the equator: South America, Africa, etc.      It's probably going to be hot.  I live in northeast China, and the temperature is about the same as it would be in New York.|`|gWleYSuIaa	Bring a coat.  China is a big country and the temperature varies.  It is very similar to the USA in that way.  In the summer it is unlikely you will need a heavy coat anywhere, but if you are in the Northern part a jacket or light coat will probably be needed  -at least in the evenings -on some days.

377c1f417391816bc94e0f5624f142e1aa	Both. There are even parents who send their children on an errand to buy cigarettes for them and the storekeeper would happily sell the item.    In my family's case, we don't sell cigarettes, beer and liquor in our store. We live by the Biblical admonition:    "Do you know that your body is the temple of the Lord which is in you? Whoever destroys his body also destroys the Lord's temple." 1 Corinthians 6:19|`|DBNCSbxeaa	It is liberalism.|`|7BAjFHqraa	Both. Parents should be vigilant, stores should abide by law.|`|soUGSKJFaa	Neither of the two!    Surely the kid will not drink the beer!    It is the one who ordered the kid to buy the beer. Maybe he knows better but is just plain lazy to buy it for himself. You know it is wrong but still you ordered the poor kid to buy it.    Bless the kid,,,  To the parent,,, have a grand time watching TV....  And to the store..... naman!  To the government..... daming batas, daming butas!|`|z5fFoTMBaa	Of course it's their parents/guardians. Store management will never consider that under-aged teens who just purchased beer, or any liquor for that matter, will be drinking the booze themselves. Store-owners will always look to sell and, therefore, manage a profitable business. It is not their concern.    They will always think that youngsters purchasing prohibited goods are sent on errand by their parents or guardians.|`|tcmaLqWFaa	Well that is just terrible.  They should lock up both parents and the store clerk as well as the store owner in that jailhouse in Arizona where that Sheriff keeps people living in tents and wearing pink underwear.  Those well-meaning little children should be placed in the care and custody of the government where they can get the proper training and parenting they obviously lack.  Maybe they could come and live at your house.  How about that.  I'm sure you are more than qualified to raise up some fine citizens of society.  Especially since you obviously care so much more for those kids than their own parents.  You go girl.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	None really... if the kid knows the possible consequences of his actions....    So it's the kids fault.... remember that... cmon restricting them ONLY WORSEN THE SITUATION... since they'll GO FOR IT MORE.|`|OmHC6d3Jaa	Why can't it be both?|`|7ONAv4vYaa	If an underage kid can buy beer from a store, i would say poor store management and poor enforcement of law.    Well if an underage kid can drink beer, well that depends. If a kid can drink beer inside the house with the parents, then I can say it is poor parenting skill. If it's the kid who really drinks beer in secret, then I can say it is the kid with poor discipline.|`|EjhJliKmaa	poor parenting skills and lack of enforcement of the law.|`|qZTIVDwqaa	I say kids will be kids, call it youthful ignorance, curiosity, whatever, for generations to come kids will try to get there hands on a Budweiser or sack of weed and thats that. Whether there parents are saints or sinners. I know I had my lil "wild" streak and so did many of my freinds but now all we do is work, go to college and try to make something of our lives. No more getting high and going to strip clubs twice a week. All that drinkin/smokin is all part of growing up and growing out of it, and thats just the way it is. Not to condone such things, but thats just the way kids (14-19) are gonna be.|`|axuicYFKaa	i think its both actually. if an underage kid is around parents who drink alot, their bound to get their hands on some beer... like say go to a store that has bad management. and the kid might look older than he really is.|`|JEb2Kqd4aa	both, but more impact on store management. restrictions regarding age when buying liquors are observed only by big merchandisers such as famous convenient stores or supermarkets, but not the variety stores in your neighborhood,they`ll sell liquor to anyone regardless of the age as long as they`re selling.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	the kid is just smart...|`|FReGm4i7aa	it's no ones fault. it's not the parents fault, the majority of kids drink..and maybe the store management can tell if they are fake id's but they probably just don't wanna deal with the headache of it. it's not a big deal-kids are just living life and kids have been drinking underage for YEARS!

TqWXXZ34aa	I lived in Warwick NY for 23 years. It was the best time of my entire life. It is a small town with lots of amenities. Spa's are close by, golfing,swimming,tennis,etc. You name it , it is there. Quaint places to eat, a tea room,coffee shops. It is in a valley. The people are really nice. it is a safe place to raise kids. The schools are the best around.  The majority of the people that live there commute to NYC. NYC is only 1 1/2 hour away. There is a bus that takes people to the city if needed. Warwick is best known for Apple Fest. draws in lots of people from NYC to pick apples for the day and crafts etc.  If you are looking for a safe,clean,with lots to do Warwick would be the place for you. Here is a link.  Rents normally go between $850~1,200. But you could go cheaper if you live in Bellvale, or Greenwood Lake. They are on the outskirts of Warwick. Very nice as well.  http://www.townofwarwick.org/  http://www.warwickcc.org/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick,_Ne...  http://www.warwickcc.org/visit/default.a...|`|lYQDCJgeaa	Your question is confusing as it is in the New York City forum, but you ask about "what city..."  New York State is BIG...and has many cities.  New York city is also big--and has many neighborhoods.    You can still find a good apartment in your price range in working class neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens.    i suggest you begin research by looking at apartment listings for Brooklyn or Queens i the internet. Try Craigslist, to start. Get an idea of the areas that are affordable, and what you can get.    Then, Google those neighborhoods, and see what comes up.    Finally, come back here and ask questions about specific neighborhoods.    Bear in mind that not only is housing expensive in NYC, bnut the overall cost of living-food. etc. is expensive.  and if you like owning a car, as most Californians do, in NYC you can fageddaboudit. Insurance alone will kill ya, and parking is near impossible.    I am from NY originally and LOVE it--but could not afford my old neighborhood in Brooklyn now.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	i agree that your question is confusing...what cities in nyc (huh?) or what cities in new york state????  do you want to live in nyc or do you want to live in the other parts of new york state, we cant answer until you clarify that...|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	The $1000-$2000 range would not land you in a bad area.  There are plenty of really nice areas in Queens and Brooklyn that you could live on that budget.  In Queens: Forest Hills, Astoria, Kew Garden, Rego Park, and Flushing.  In Brooklyn: Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Park Slope, Midwood, Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Brighton Beach ... You could even afford a nice sized studio/one bedroom in the $1200-$1500 range in most of the areas.  Or, you could room with someone in Manhattan for the price, but you'll be living in a box with some random stranger :)    As for those horrible stories about growing up in New York, they're usually isolated incidences.  If your name isn't Jay-Z or 50 Cent, you probably didn't grow up in a dilapidated crack house in Jamaica or Bed-Stuy.  My family and I lived almost my entire life (since I moved here as a child from Eastern Europe) in a working class neighborhood in the the Russian section of Brooklyn - and I had a very fun and memorable child hood.  I wish people would stop basing a few rappers' accounts of the 'hood on the entire New York area.  It's annoying.    So, if you move here and would like to find employment and take a few classes to better yourself, New York is the place to be.  Go to craigslist and look for different employment (yes, the economy is bad, but depending on your field, you might get lucky - I did after I graduated last June).  I still think this is the best area of the country to get an education - I lived in Boston for a year and hated it, and I got my undergrad in Buffalo, NY, but I've been happier than ever since I started grad classes back home.  We certainly a wide range of academic institutions.  As for having or keeping a car, it's annoying in terms of parking, and insurance is expensive (or can be) but if you were planning on driving from CA to NY, just keep it insured there (lol, a little illegal, but lots of people do it - I sitll have my car registered in Buffalo and I never even lived there as a resident).    As for other cities, if you're looking to live around the metropolitan New York area, you can look into Westchester and Rockland Counties.  Rockland isn't too far - there are little towns (not like, tiny and rural, but nice and quaint compared to New York) where many people who work or go to school in New York commute from.  If you don't want to be next to or close to New York City, look into places like Albany or Buffalo.  They both have very good school (University at Albany and University at Buffalo, respectively, in terms of state schools) and some job opportunities, but they're suffering a little in that area, too, like the rest of the country.    Good luck!
NzHtbpfJaa	http://www.realestate.com.au/cgi-bin/rse...  is the most popular site in Australia.  Most real estates hook up to it and post their rentals online.  Average price... well it depends on an average price for a one bedroom, two bedroom etc.. and you didn't state how many bedrooms.    However put in your search criteria and it will give you all the options.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	http://www.realestate.com.au    depends on what state u live in and how close to the city u are .  im about 15km from the city in perth WA and pay almost $300 per week|`|zcpa0hfkaa	Where I am, the average rent is about $260 - $400 a week for anything decent. These are mostly apartment and townhouses, although there is the occasional home that appears    hope this helps|`|zOyWCvqtaa	Apartment prices vary in australia depending on several factors which are a) Where you are and b) proximity to the city in question.    For example a studio apartment in the central area of Sydney City (called the CBD here) could very well cost you close to $1000 per week mark.  Whereas in a new block in the outer suburbs you could pay as little as $300 per week...even less in some older style places.  In fact in some parts it can be cheaper to rent a house over an apratment.  For example I'm paying $230/week for a 3 bedroom house with air conditioning in Campbelltown (about 40km from Sydney CBD), yet a 2 bedroom apartment is over $300/week in some the of the newer blocks in the same area.  In fact I saw one for $410/week.  Keep in mind that the east coast in generally more expensive with Sydney and Melbourne being the most expensive in Australia, followed by Canberra, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Darwin and Hobart.    Your best sources for rental properties are:    http://www.realestate.com.au    http://www.domain.com.au    All rents are quoted as per week.  Also each state has differing rental laws but in NSW you generally need to pay 4 weeks rent as bond + 2 weeks in advance.  Also you need to apply and the more evidence you provide of work/study and previous rentals help....even overseas references may help.  Also real estate agents are not required to give you a reason why if you are turned down.

Egypt is going in it's way to support Palestinian citizens, the way we find it suitable. Egyptians will not join intifada and will not do anything according to some sick plans of any one.      There was no secret that Israel said they will attack and what they will do. Now also they said they will attack again, it's not a secret. Go on and stop them if you can. Egypt can't stop them without coordination with the resistance in Gaza.     Where is the Syrian military ! where is the Qatari relations with Izrael ! where is the Hezaballah rockets !! where is the Iranian support !! all doing nothing on the ground. All are helpless and using the poor Palestinian kids, women and old men to be the price for applying their policies.     No more 3ntar in the area. If you want war we all go together and whoever want it, come with your body to pay the price like the Egyptian 120000 souls lost in wars.

You can also extend that tourist visa for another 30 days if you go to immigration and apply the cost for that is 1,900 baht.|`|77oS1YN8aa	This applies to australian passport holders.You will still get 30 days visa exempt when you arrive at the airport, but the land crossng rules have changed  New Visa Rules for Thailand   By thaizer ? December 29, 2008     In the first week of December 2008, new visa rules came into force in Thailand. The new ruling mainly affects visitors entering Thailand at a land border checkpoint without a visa. Visitors arriving at any of Thailands international airports should not be affected by the new rules.     Arriving in Thailand by Land or Sea Crossing  The old ruling used to be that most visitors entering Thailand without a visa would be granted a 30-day permission to stay stamp also known as the visa exemption rule (some travellers mistakenly call this a visa on arrival). Under the new regulations, those arriving in Thailand via a land or sea crossing without a visa will now only be granted a 15-day permission to stay/visa exemption instead of 30 days. Under the old system there were limits to the number of back-to-back stamps you could gain in this way. Under the new rules that limit has gone and in theory travellers can continually enter and re-enter Thailand at a land border crossing every 15 days if they so desire without the need to apply in advance for a visa.

You will see them in subway stations (usually down on the tracks and thus not at any risk of touching you).  You will see them running around in City parks if you go there after dark.  And occasionally you will see them in a restaurant or an apartment building, but that's less frequent.

I just posted a question about New York cuz I also had thoughts of living there too. The people I've met who lived there say that there is a high population of rats. A Japanese gal I know who visited New York this past December '08 said she & her friends went to this restaurant. As they were waiting for their food, a mouse ran past their feet under their table. They were soo horrified by it that they left the restaurant. Then the cook had the nerve to chase after them & told them to at least pay for the drinks. The cook also said that it's normal for rats to run around. Of course, they didn't stick around. I saw this on You Tube, plump rats in KFC/Taco Bell: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40qihGbng...

Imqb5ueqaa	The budget for a company is created by using a forecast on revenue and expenses for a certain period. Usually for one year (called fiscal year) and reviewed at least quarterly.    Thus, the revenue is first reviewed. Are the businesses we had last year staying on? Growing, or declining? After looking at last year's business and determining its impact for the incoming year, the company then makes a forecast of incremental revenues based on new business. Are new products going to be launched? Is a new service going to be offered? Are we bullish about getting new clients? What is the incremenatl revenue from all of these?    Then, the estimates for all expenses for the incoming year: salaries, lease, leasehold improvements, amortizations, taxes, representation expenses, etc. This is either increased if revenues are forecast to be bigger, or slashed when times are hard.    these numbers become the BUDGET. The budget can be adjusted depending on how business is shaping up.|`|EjhJliKmaa	by carefully planning the financial and operational future of an entity.|`|7BAjFHqraa	This is what I do:    (1) The budget must be realizable, meaning the target budget must be within my means or within my salary.

Go straight ahead, passing through Southvale, Avida, Versailles, Portofino, etc until you get to an intersection where you will see SM Molino as you drive. Cross that intersection, just going on forward. Thsi road is tricky because half of the road is unfinished, so there is a two-way traffic on waht is supposed to be the road going in your direction.    From there, take the first road to the right (not entrances to subdivisions, look for the road!). Go straight ahead until you come to an intersection where a LOTTO sign is prominent. Cross that road which snakes around what looks like a subdivision. Go on driving, do not make any turns, and Augustine Grove will be within sight eventually.

N1sfHiPkaa	It's very likely a badly mangled/typoed version of Rimaszombat, which is a town now in Slovakia, called Rimavk Sobota in Slovakian. The parts are Rima, which is the name of a nearby river, and szombat, which is Hungarian for 'Saturday'. (In other words, it's the place near the Rima where the weekly market was on Saturdays.)|`|9g8spRvPaa	My Hungarian husband suggested that you try the spelling this way  Rima Szombat.  Szombat means Saturday in Hungarian.  The name was probably misspelled onyour papers.This as also happened to me while trying to find my fathers town in Poland. When he entered the USA, they butchered the spelling and I can't find the town he was born in.  Good luck, you might also try looking for the town in Slovakia or Romania since they took over much of the Hungarian lands over the course of the two world wars.|`|NFt3h7dHaa	First, you're lucky to have Magyar ancestors!  They're amazing people!  And mad props to you for doing your genealogy.    Neither Rima or Szambert are familiar names/words to me, and I speak Hungarian (though I'm not a native).  The "sz" combination is definitely of Hungarian origin, though (it's pronounced "s").    If this ancestor was born before World War I, chances are great that this town is actually in a neighboring country.  After the Treaty of Trianon in 1918, the country lost over 2/3 of its land mass which was absorbed into the neighboring countries of the Ukraine, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Austria.  The name of the town may have changed after that to something in the language of the country it was absorbed into (though many people especially near the borders of Hungary in these other countries will say, "I'm from where ever in Romania--but I'm Hungarian").  Lots of people who are from these areas in modern terms are actually Hungarian.  :)    Or the town could have changed names and still be located in modern-day Hungary.  Many vowels have accents, and you could be missing them (though with or without all possible accents, these still aren't words I recognize, but I'm not a native so there are lots of words I don't know).    Good luck!

Once you're established that you are eligible, then I'd start looking into specifics. You have to get residence before you can even start thinking about citizenship (I think you have to live here three years first).    Our economy is not yet in as bad a state as yours but that's only because there is a lag - we are tied to China's fortunes and they have only just started hitting the "slowdown" button, so unfortunately Australia is bound to be badly affected in the medium to long term.    Living costs vary, like anywhere in the world. The big cities like Sydney and Melbourne have the highest costs, but they also have the highest paying jobs.

Details of the state and whether you're near the coast, surrounding suburbs, etc. would be helpful.    In general, though, Australia is a great place to live. Ignore what people say about deadly spiders, snakes and crocodiles. America has bears for goodness' sake!    For details about immigration and citizenship, here's a helpful website:  http://www.immi.gov.au/immigration/    Again, living costs depend on where you live. It's more expensive to live in the city and usually around coastal areas. Inland is a cheaper option, but farmers have it extremely tough at the the moment (so don't go too far inland!)    Australians are mostly laid-back, accepting people. I'm sure there's people who are homophobic here, but most Australians don't have a problem with gays (as much as Americans do, anyhow.) We even have the Mardi Gras every year, a huge gay/lesbian carnival.    Edit: What are all the thumbs-downs for? We all gave perfectly reasonable answers. Stupid trolls...

The crime is worse in places, better in others. I guess there's a lot to do but it depends on what you like to do. I mean you won't be mountain climbing or surfing here. Great food, theatre, museums, sporting events, shopping,..it's expensive here, taxes are high, traffic sucks, ehhh. I missed it when I left and I'm sick of it now that I'm back.|`|gkqSk29Zaa	Im from Chicago and I love it, theirs no city like it. But, you really should visit before you decide to move. Chicago always looks like a paradise city in the movies when it always isn't.    Pros- Great architectural city, great food, trendy, fast paced, people are generally nice, has culture, awesome transportation system, lake michigan, four seasons, cheap compared to NYC, SF, and DC, always something to do or see.    Cons- Chicago is the homeland of gangs, bums asking for money downtown, very cold long winters, people who honk their horns 0.5 seconds after the light changes, corrupt cops and politicians.|`|liJKE5B2aa	The people are losers, the crime rate is the highest in the U.S. and it depends on what you mean by "Do There".|`|BNHeJm8Maa	I lived there for 3 months in 2007 and it's amazing!!! The lake is so beautiful and the beaches are so accessible. I worked in Navy Pier and its a great place to go and watch the fireworks or just hang out. It's really easy to find your way around the city and the 'El' is a great resource for getting around.

Two big moments was twenty years ago, when a plane crashed into a lake, killing all of the Canadian passengers, and the Mumbai tourist attacks. Canadian passports are accepted almost everywhere, which is why some people hurt Canadians - just to get their passports.|`|YOh8L5epaa	That really is a stupid question!! How can any one no the answer that?
DHczAdHIaa	You have nothing to be concerned about as, in my experience, disabled passengers are treated with the utmost respect and receive priority attention and seating.   It is important, if booking online, that you check before booking what the airline requests, as far as the disabled are concerned.  Some like to be informed at the time of booking, others you can let know up to a couple of days before flying and there are a few who request that you advise them before commencing your booking.   You would be asked the extent of your disability, in order that the airline & ground staff are fully prepared for your arrival on the departure date.  A disabled person would normally be received at a special information desk after passing through security.   From here you would be transported by wheelchair or electric tractor (buggy) to the boarding gate.  If the plane is not parked on a tunnel, you will have the choice of boarding by the aircraft steps, if you are able, or entering the aircraft via a lift attached to a specially adapted vehicle.   If you have your own wheelchair, and board via a tunnel, you will be able to go all the way to the aircraft, where your chair will be taken from you and loaded in the luggage compartment.   In extreme cases where a passenger has, for example, no lower limbs ground service staff are on hand to carry that person aboard and place them in their seat.  The disabled (and their travelling companion) are usually seated at the front of the aircraft and in most cases are either the first to board or after those who have paid for speedy boarding.  Enjoy your trip.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	It would help if you described both the experience and the nature of the disability.|`|23vKOyBraa	Many disabled people do not like pointing out their disability I know, but please, in this case, tell the airline before you fly. Give them a chance to prepare anything that might be required.    Once you get to the airport (assuming you have no minder and can't get around yourself) a staff member will be assigned as your buddy to get you through all the airport mess and right up to the aircraft door, where they cabin crew will help you get seated and comfortable. Again, I'm talking about mobility disabilities here.
958EXZEhaa	Things to do and see:  Rockefeller Center  Top of the Rock - view of the city  Time Square - walk around and maybe get something to eat  Central Park - Horse carriage ride  Macy's - 34th street and Broadway  South Street Seaport - downtown by wall street. nice to see  Broadway show  IMAX Theater - you can watch a movie there.  Museum of Natural History  Wax Museum in Time Square  Manhattan mall - for some shopping.  Empire State Building  Statue of Liberty  Take the sight seeing bus - you can find those in time square.  Sightseeing Cruises - by pier 43 (Especially the Harbor lights cruise is really nice)  If you're going to see a show, go to the TKTS booth in Times Square, but get there early in the morning or you'll have to wait in line all day.      Shopping:  Century 21 - by ground zero  Manhattan mall - broadway and 34th street  5th ave - desiner stores - between 50st to 59th st  Time Sqauare  China town  Time warner center has a mall - by columbus circle    Nightlight: Check out this site for all type of clubs.  http://www.ny.com/nightlife/    Brooklyn  Bbrooklyn bridge    Hope this was helpful.

You don't have to go through tours to see the sites!    THEN, when you're done with that, check out the things on the NFT website : http://notfortourists.com/NewYork.aspx    And most importantly, enjoy your time in NYC!|`|X4FQBmo9aa	Top of the rock if you want to see the best views of the city.  Its cheaper and better than the empire state building.  You get a great view of central park to the north and the southern view is a slight glimpse at Times Square and a great view of everything south (Midtown, Lower Manhattan etc.)  Also, the lines are much much shorter than the Empire State Building.    If you want to go bar hoping the East Village and Lower East Side have a lot of really good bars and good food.  I like the East village better than LES because it tends to be a little less of a scene.  If you like big crowds and too much hair product then Fri and Sat are fine, but if you are more into low key vibes then week days are great.  You still get a crowd, but it tends to be locals instead of the bridge and tunnels crowd.      Most neighborhoods have great brunch specials.  Its an unwritten local tradition.  Brunch in most places start around 10am, but NYC we tend to start 12-2 and go until 4-5.      If you like American BBQ,  there is a really good place near where you are staying. http://www.virgilsbbq.com/      Korean BBQ is really great too and there is a small section on 32nd between 6th and 5th Avenues that has several restaurants.  I've tried several and I've loved every one.    Have fun and pace yourself.  A 21st b'day in NYC can almost be too fun so drink plenty of water and have Tylenol prepared for the morning :)

Generally you get along well with summer clothes in all metros all year (a light sweater/cardigan would be the most you need in case the A/C is in fridge mode) except for:  * Delhi (which gets real cold during winter time and keep in mind that apartments generally have no heating) and maybe  * Bangalore (which may become a little chilly from evenings to mornings in December thru to February).     While a set of sweaters will do for Bangalore, winter time in Delhi requires also jackets and underwear. For Mumbai and Chennai you would not need any winterish stuff. Summer shoes should always do. In case the mosoon hits you, just get some local shoes which are darn cheap in India and see them as disposables. A/Cs are usually not set to too low in India, at least not in larger companies. But as India is the land of exceptions and surprises... be prepared.

pO4BpfGaaa	Hi,    I have done this trip for our honeymoon.  Started in Paris for 3 days stayed in la defense area in paris, which is modern outside city center yet it is a 10 minutes ride by underground. La defense has a lot of modern reasonably priced hotels.  Traveled from paris to cannes by train remained in Cannes for 4 days taking day tripsdifferentrent partsProvenceance , Monte carlo, Nice, Ezze and other tourist attractions.  Took train from cannes to Tuscany and stayedSiennaiena rented a car to take day trips to Pienza.,Monte palchianno, Perugia , Rome.  Then took train fSiennaiena to Venice for 3 days.  The last part was in Switzerland a country I know very well where I htraveledlled a lot by train and car.  With switzerland being a small country it is best to stay in the center around Interlaken. You can then either drive or get a rail pass (This is highly recommended so that you can enjoy the scenery) Rail passes are cheaper to buy in your country of residence. The highly recommended places to visit are Schilthorn, Jungfrauich, and Titlis Mountain (you need a n add on ticket for that). In addition to Zermatt, Lussane, Lugano, St. Moritz, and Geneva. All these places are accessible via rail. Actually Rail passes also have the option of taking the Bus. You do not need to purchase the book for train and bus schedule from the swiss rail shops as the schedules are clear on every rail and bus station.  You can easily plan a day for 2 or even 3 locations if you start your day early.  Remember to book for everything before you travel it is cheaper this way.

This is an important part of federalism, because DC holds the federal govt and they our founding fathers wanted to keep the federal govt distinct and separate from state powers, so DC can never be incorporated into another state.

a55d7916302a44493251687277cdc073aa	Spring comes later in Nova Scotia compared to Ontario.  Add about 3 weeks onto the time that the trees leaf in Ontario and you have the start of our spring.  The past 2 years the summer (July and August) have been fairly rainy.  I would have to agree that September is the nicest month.  But if I was to choose a summer month I would say August.  Most workers tend to take the last week of July and the first week of August.  This is usually our warmest period.    As for sea food...it is always in season somewhere.  The areas that are fished (especially lobster) rotate around the province, so it is always available.    - Last year I felt I had 5 weeks of summer here in Halifax...and those were the weeks I was down the US.  It was very rainy here last year so come prepared.|`|eDL3cnL4aa	Agreed that September is best; July has many festivals and activities, though.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	Your mom is right, July in Sydney (all of NS actually) is the best time, but it also has the most tourists.

But you can always catch your own!|`|8fRodbOQaa	The last time I was in NS it was for a week in mid- August.  The weather was  wonderful - warm & dry.

September would be too cold, the best time to get lobster is July and lots of stuff goes on the beginning of August. There is the Natal day parade on Aug 4 plus fireworks. Also they have many festivals in the summer time. September is when everything dies down and people start wearing their fall jackets. Good luck and I hope you have fun.
LDqzP2LVaa	You'd probably want to take driving classes (theoretical and Practical) with Emirates Driving Company (EDC) because you need their approval to get a driving license. It's the official driving training program adopted by the Traffic and Licensing Authority, and u cannot take the diving test without taking classes with the EDC   U can book for classes either in Musaffah or in Mushrif (Mushrif only for girls and Musaffah for both). Check their website for more info.  www.edcad.ae|`|JZe8zss9aa	Hi  Well, I am going the same route so will try and help you out. If you already have a driving license from your home country, you need to open a file first in Musaffah, take 4 theory lessons ( there is some exemption if you are a Manager and above ), pass a theory test and get a green driving card. Once you have done that, you go to Muroor and take a test date which is about a month away from the day you apply. You can then hire one of the many instructors, by the hour and practice on their cars. You can see many of them next to Carrefour on airport road.  Hope this helps.

(sorry for the word)     BUT, for caucasians, such as yourself, they treat you with more respect than they do their asian teachers. they will cooperate with you, respect you, and maybe even befriend you.     there are some very nice korean people i've met too. so, i suppose, it all depends on the person's character. now, well, as for life outside of school, majority of the korean population cannot speak nor understand english. so, if you want to go sight seeing, i suggest that you learn the basics or at least some korean phrases that might be helpful for when you go to town. Better yet, bring a student with you, who can speak english well, so he can translate for you and show you the sights.    good luck to you.|`|iprjGPH6aa	hi I'm korean student  I think English teacher is amazing and novel|`|HfaE9yt4aa	by and large my students are respectable, funny and kind. they like asking questions and mimic what i say which teaches them all sorts of new slang and phrases!     as you will see from answers, there are a lot of horrible experiences here too- the people are quite racist and judgmental. the language barrier and the fact that you don't have an official position in their confucist society does cause koreans to come off as rude and reserved. in some cases it is true and in some it isn't.     by and large you probably won't be impressed with koreans as a group. individuals you will meet help redeem the society though. there are some cool koreans here and there. kids are a crapshoot- you could get great kids (i know many people who have) or you could get monsters.     as for foreigners- it is a little hard to make friends if you are the only foreigner at your job as i am. short of walking up to people in the street to introduce myself (which i don't do) it can be hard to meet people. i am not the most outgoing of people so that doesn't help either.     it really depends mostly on you- if you have a positive attitude, don't hole yourself up at home and meet people when out and about, you will have a great experience here!

Here in Thailand you most likely could get by with your Singapore drivers license if pulled over for a ticket, but if you get in an accident, you better have an International Drivers Permit with you. They're easy enough to get, are cheap and don't require any tests, just a valid drivers license is all you need. Reputable car rental companies may also require that you have one. You can get one at an AA office in Singapore.  http://www.drivers.com/article/937/|`|wfBwgAMQaa	You need to go to AA(Automobile Association.

AA10994550	Usually you should bring a book and an Ipod since the movie screens and the headphones are usually pretty crappy in an airplane. Also if you're going to an international country that doesn't speak English, such as Mexico or French Canada (Quebec) you should try to study the native language a little bit before you get there by bringing along a phrasebook. If  that doesn't suit you try striking up a conversation with the passenger next to you. Conversations do make time fly by really quickly.    Hope that helps! Happy travels!|`|zpQnda9Eaa	bring your i-pod and book..time will pass by before you know it...talk to the people around yu..|`|qdsVS1dDaa	I always travel with a book that is an old friend. That is one that I have read before, and can read again. That way, if I  am interrupted, it is not a big distraction. Magazines are a good bet, too. Some people like to work puzzles and anagrams. It really depends on what you like to do.    Regards,  Dan|`|2VsmOU7zaa	Bring you IPod and a good book. They will more than likely have movies to watch on the plane ride too.|`|c1379040fcc5c4a581798d49a39f2446aa	book|`|9HyEfkk8aa	Five hours will definitely go quickly. By the time you've settled in, had a drink, a meal, sorted out your headphones, what station/movie you want to listen to/watch, read the in-flight mag from cover to cover, marveled at the sights outside your plane window and had a quick nap, you'll probably be ready to land! Most airlines provide mags and newspapers and that way you don't have to worry about lugging around a book that you've read. Striking up a conversation with your next door neighbours can also be one of the best parts of travelling!    Enjoy your trip!
LbkLg4RFaa	Hi from Townsville.  It's very wet up here at the moment and even wetter in poor Ingham 100km north of here.  A lot of houses just had the water go down and they are getting another flood of about the same height.  In some areas where the houses are built up there was like 10ft of water on the roads.      My family come from the area and all have been very fortunate and only had water under their highset houses.  At my parents their was almost 6ft of water under their house.  A lot of cars parked on higher ground have been inundated.    All the cattle and wallabies drowned out near Normanton just breaks your heart.  The poor animals never had a chance.  There were reports of the stronger wallabies that were trying to get out of the water standing on the backs of weaker animals.  Crops under water for a week and now possibly longer.      Hopefully it stops raining soon but apparently it could be like a week before it stops.|`|sZFA4XXZaa	I'm from down in Sydney and I feel for you guys.

In fact the low pressure system causing the flooding e.t.c in FNQ has set up a trough that is causing the heatwave down here in the southern states.|`|oaALpra0aa	Love the tropical downpours but 7metres is toooooo much!

OYYYNCyCaa	the Australian government either labor or liberal do not have the intelligence at all to think about harvesting water     simple harvest the water especially from the north with the tropical storms and the water could be used across Australia  north Queensland, coming down and allowing the water to be used for irrigation across new south wales, sa, vic, se Queensland    this would allow Australia to be a major food producer across the Asia and the unemployment would drop dramatically    BUT Chairman Kevin or his brain dead members and the opposition could not think past today without building the water infrastructure    if this government in 2008 built the sydney harbour bridge it would be one lane each way|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	I have been hearing about this on and off for decades.  Last  thing I read about it was several years ago so don't ask me for details, but the conclusion was that the land surveys that Bradfield based his scheme on were not accurate, particularly about the slopes and elevations of the land. More accurate surveys taken since the 1930s have more or less ruled most of the scheme out.      I crossed the Burdekin River in July last year between Ayr and Home Hill.  It was just the usual chain of waterholes along a sandy riverbed.  Vast amounts of water flow out in the wet season, but after that it virtually dries up.  Putting big dams upstream would make it dry most of the year and also deny many nutrients to the Great Barrier Reef, which is heavily affected by the Burdekin.        There is also the question of salt.  Irrigation inevitably leads to the accumulation of salt in the soil in many cases.  I'm not saying this can't be overcome, or minimised, but it is always a threat.     What makes more sense to me is the improvement of the railway systems.  There have been some wild eyed schemes there too, when I arrived in Canberra in 1990 there was a lot of nonsense being talked about 300km/hr  "Very Fast Trains" from Sydney to here and through to Melbourne.  That would have meant just about an entirely new route.    At the same time as all this waffle was going on, Queensland had already introduced a service from Brisbane to Rockhampton (around 700km) with trains speeds of up to 100km/hr.  This has been increased to 160 km/hr more recently over some sections and it used pretty much the same rail alignments laid down before 1900.        The Sydney to Melbourne rail should be duplicated to reduce delays as trains cross, and electrified to reduce dependence on imported transport fuels. A fast passenger service running 160km/hr with only five or six stops between Sydney and Melbourne would compete with airlines to some extent, as long as it was cheaper and also with buses and cars.|`|MJdUkar5aa	It sounds like a fabulous scheme. The drawback that I can think of is that a great deal of this would involved negotiating with the traditional owners of the lands involved. Could take years. HOwever, I think it's a damn fine idea.|`|C6EnMKz1aa	Australians would be better off trying to adapt to the land we live in rather than trying to change it. Maybe we should work on a system that reuses water locally rather than engineering schemes that move water across a continent. Much of inland Queensland has artesian water but the soils are not that great for agriculture. The Ord River scheme in West Australia was meant to make northern Australia a great food bowl. It didnt happen. Lowering our impact on the earth seems to me to be a far better solution.

g05wGcPhaa	This is Miami in a nutshell.    In Miami the cities are divided into numerous area's. Places to avoid in Miami are Liberty City, Overtown, North Miami, Opa Locka, Atlantic City, Carol City, Little Haiti, or anything around Opa Locka Airport. Good places to live in are some parts of Homestead, Coconut Grove, Key Biscayne, Coral Gables, South Miami, and Midtown. Most of these places are expensive like crazy.    Affordable homes? Psshh..Miami is a big city and it's divided into smaller cities so it depends which area of Miami you move to. Some area's are prone to crime and poverty so the average apartment rent for a good area there would be about $1500 if you live in a decent area. Home's are selling less and less today so expect to see real estate prices in the 350k-400k.    As of right now it's nearly impossible to find a job especially in Miami Dade County. The unemployment rate right now in South Florida has reached 8.1% since December 08 , higher than the national unemployment rate of 7.2%. So that means 752,000 are jobless right now. In the tri-county area, Palm Beach County had the highest unemployment rate, with 7.8 percent, followed by Miami-Dade, with 7 percent, and Broward, with 6.8 percent. Most companies are cutting jobs right now so it's going to be quite hard for you to find a job because now you have to compete with a whole bunch of people who probably want the same position.    I'm a conservative guy and I like to save whatever I can. Odds are no one is thinking about hiring anyone. In the last couple of months unemployment center lines went from about 20 to thousands. Not even McDonald's is hiring and that's unusual.    As for the weather here it varies from time to time but usually its the same all year round aside from a couple months. Between the months of May and October its the rainy season aka "Hurricane Season". We haven't had any major hurricanes here for about 3-4 years now so were on the lucky side. Although its rainy season when its not pouring outside its still hot and the humidity level is up. Between the months of November and December we experience cold fronts that usually cool us down, but not for a long time. Most only last a week, but again as I said before when its not cold/raining its still hot outside and the humidity level is up. Make good use of sunblock and sunglasses because your gonna need them if you visit or move to South Florida.    Also If your planning on moving to Miami get ready for nasty rush hour traffic and constant accidents on the 826 (Palmetto Expressway) and any other highway in Miami-Dade County. Miami has the worst set of drivers that's why I rather live in Broward County.|`|ACIp8lZqaa	Boom Boom answers very well and detailed...............

FHdF0ZJLaa	EVERYTHING in the main city of Tokyo is reachable by train. There are many people who don't own cars and have never driven, so don't be afraid of things not being easily accessible. I've lived here for half a year so far without a car and haven't missed it.    If you'll be around on a Sunday and enjoy people watching I advise checking out Yoyogi park in Harajuku. There's a bridge right next to the station where people go to hang out dressed up. Some people have quite elaborate costumes. There's also usually a "free hugs" group of people there, and if you go further from the station near the entrance to the park you'll find the Tokyo Rockabilly Club dancing. It's very very strange, and quite funny. This is mostly only on Sundays though. (if you decide to do this, get off the train at the Harajuku station, not the Yoyogi station).  If you want to be a tourist, in Shinjuku you might want to check out the Tokyo Tocho building. It's the metropolitan government building and is 202 meters high, you can go to the top and look out over the city. It's free and there's a souvenir shop at the top where you can get touristy things. I don't know how to get to it from the station (I was following people last time I went and paid no attention to direction) but I'm sure if you ask everyone should know where it is. (http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/TMG/ob...    Have fun!    Edit:    Regarding those hotels you posted. Once you are within the main city, just about everything is close to the train.   The first hotel you linked has a "location" page with maps and info about how close it is to the nearest train station and how close it is to Narita. Check it out - http://www.sakura-hotel-hatagaya.com/hot...  It says it's a 2 min walk to Hatagaya station. I don't know that station specifically but once you're at a station you can go anywhere, the Yamanote line in Tokyo runs in a giant circle (see map on site) so if you can get on a train on that line you're good to go to wherever you like in the city.    The second hotel you linked, the page won't load for me but that's likely because my internet is stupid and randomly decides not to load certain sites for no reason. But, check out if they have a map or something, most hotels will tell you how close they are to the nearest station.|`|LrGhFAkkaa	I went there a few years back and here is my trip report with pictures and links http://gardkarlsen.com/japan_tokyo.htm .

9QBlKlFmaa	You are nearly right.    Most evangelicals are indeed more Zionist than certain Jews.  But MUlsims do indeed attack Christians.    For example, Hamas's endorsement of nailing enemies of Islam to crosses came at the same time it renewed its jihad. Here, too, Hamas wanted to make sure that Christians didn't feel neglected as its fighters launched missiles at Jewish day care centers and schools. So on Christmas day, Hamas lobbed a mortar shell at the Erez crossing point into Israel just as a group of Gazan Christians were standing on line waiting to travel to Bethlehem for Christmas.    That led directly to the long-awaited Israeli response. It is hoped that this will finally bring to an end the Muslim terror attacks from Gaza on the civilians of southern Israel.        .|`|i7oHTo9haa	Because they haven't started on them yet.  They're still working on us!    Hitler (a fascist dictator) started with Jewish people first, but he had plans for everyone else who wasn't of his master Aryan race. He didn't get a chance to accomplish it he picked off what he thought was the weaker lambs in the pack.    The Arabs have the same fascist mindset and goals of Hitler, just with a "religious twist." Achmedinejad and the Hamas and the other extremists already express their hatred of everyone else. It's Israel first, Jewish people first, then onto Europe and the Americas.    It's just Jewish people are holding them back. We've come along way since Hitler era, and so has society in their support for us.    If you want to know about one example how they consider Christians, consider that the "last straw" on the latest Gaza conflict started on Dec 24 when the Hamas sent a barrage of rocket fire into Israel.

Best to wait...Cozumel will still be there in a few years when he is older.  And you would enjoy going with other adult friends. Cruises are too expensive to go on would it would be so stressful.  Use your time at home for close to home activities you could both enjoy.|`|AA11626766	It sounds like you're not going to be able to relax and enjoy it - even with the best of care.  Cruising is great, but it's an expensive way to find that you couldn't relax and have fun if you're worrying about your son!  I understand completely what you mean.  I took my 2 year old last year, but she had her older (10) sister to keep her company and I had my husband to share the load.  I'd wait!  Your vacation is too precious to be worrying BEFORE you go!!!|`|X6rFPI2laa	If you can afford to take a babysitter or nanny, that would be OK, but with you as the only adult I think this is not a really good idea -- at all!  And with any child who runs away and does not listen, that's not good, particularly on shore.  A child who does that on board ship will be a danger to other passengers.  The on board kid activities are good on many ships -- Disney is the very best! -- but that is only a few hours.      I think a child of that age is too young to enjoy the trip, and far too young to allow YOU to enjoy the trip unless you have another adult with you.      If you can leave him at home and go by yourself, do it!  I have taken several cruises as a solo, and have thoroughly enjoyed them.|`|Ib5XecOiaa	He may be a bit too young to enjoy such a nice vacation.  I took my active 3 year old on a cruise to Hawaii from LA about 10 years ago.  We wound up flying home from Hawaii because I was so worried he would scale the walls and jump into the water!  I wasn't going to take the chance! Wait till he is older. I would then try a Disney Cruise.  My kids & I love them.  They are First Class and are geared to kids.  All of their employees are carefully screened and have all had background checks.  I will not trust a cruise line that is not American.   Too many weird things have happened to people through the years on other cruise lines.  Good luck to you.|`|DGXE4VH0aa	it doesn't seem like you're ready to go on a cruise with him...you will worry too much and it'll take the fun out of it.

Quanto voc precisa por dia    Seu pacote inclui tudo ou s a passagem? Fa?a uma lista do que mais precisar: transporte local, refei??es (duas por dia!), hospedagens, passeios e - por que n?o? - compras. Uma dica geral: divida a grana que tem pelo nmero de dias que vai ficar. E controle a cota diria com m?o-de-ferro. No caso a caso, porm, veja aqui quanto voc vai precisar com...    ...transportes  O que o leva at o destino (avi?o, ?nibus ou carro)  a maior despesa da viagem. Depois, vm os transportes locais.   Evite txis nos aeroportos. S?o caros. H servi?os de ?nibus ou vans que levam a pontos estratgicos da cidade e saem   mais em conta.  Na mdia, separe 40% do dinheiro de viagem.    ...hospedagem  Divida - sempre - com mais algum, porque sozinho sair mais caro. No Brasil, uma boa pousada custa R$ 80 - ou seja,   R$ 40 para cada um. Na Europa, um hotelzinho de duas estrelas - escolhido a dedo - sai por cerca de 60.    Para dois, sobe para 80. Para dormir, v?o outros 25% do or?amento.    ...refei??es  A diria tem caf da manh?? Relaxe. Sen?o, voc far uma boa economia no exterior tomando o caf na rua.   Em Nova York ou Paris gastar uns US$ 3. Uma refei??o no Nordeste custa uns R$ 20 por pessoa.   Na Europa, um menu fixo mais um lanche sair, por dia, uns 20. L se v?o mais 20% da grana.    ...passeios  Pacotes costumam ter traslados e passeios includos - neste caso, normalmente um city tour. Se um passeio de jangada custa s R$ 6 em Macei, um musical da Broadway, em Nova York, sai por US$ 30, num bom assento. Quanto voc vai gastar depender do que quer curtir na viagem.   Separe outros 10% para isso.    ...compras  Essas, sim, esfolam o bolso dos incautos! Para n?o dizer que n?o esteve l, compre suvenires. H simples lembran?as que custam um nico real! Mas h outras que, pagas em dlar, precisam estar na ponta do lpis. Reserve outros 5%.

Valle Nevado est 3.205 metros sobre o nvel do mar e tem 9.000 hectares de superfcie esquivel, distribudas em 31 kilometros de pistas.  "El Dorado" dos esportes de inverno, assim o chamam a Valle Nevado, est apoiado na infra-estrutura hoteleira e gastron?mica. Qualidade, um timo servi?o e a hospitalidade chilena distinguem seus hotis e restaurantes, tambm promete junto ao fitness center os melhores espetculos organizados para frias de inverno inesquecveis.

CwrayzxBaa	It will definitely be one of the hottest days, but not necessarily on record.  I once experience a 50 degrees celsius day in WA's northwest.  It was so hot that many airconditioners broke down.       Some things to remember:    With everyone in Sydney (and beyond) likely wanting to put the airconditioner on, the power stations are going to be working overtime.  Here's some things you might want to try:    1. Draw all the blinds/ curtains in the house closed.  This stops heat coming in through the windows and keeps your home cooler.       2. If you have ceiling fans (or large floor fans) as well as air conditioning, then put the airconditioner on a about an hour.  After that turn it of, and let the fans recirculate the air around the house.  You will save a ton in power bills with the same cooling effect.  My Mum used to do this all the time in the tropical Northwest.    3. Switch to lighter, breezier clothing.  Forget T-shirts, wear anything thats loose fitting and made from 100% cotton.   Polyester is also good (not good in a fire though) as it will wicker the sweat away from you.    4. Keep well hydrated.   My family used to not only keep about 3 bottles of cold water in the refridgerator, they kept the glasses there too.   Drinking cold water out of cold glasses is amazingly refreshing.    5. If it all gets too much - head down to the mall or see a Movie.   They have backup power and you can feel cool while shopping or being entertained during the heat of the day.  Best of all, you don't have to pay the power bill.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	Sunday is predicted to be low - mid 30s on the coast with mid 40s in the west. High 40s inland. 34C in Sydney and 31 at my place. On http://ninemsn.com.au/ you can enter your postcode for a weather guide.     Luckily, where I live in Wollongong seems to be pretty much the coolest place in Australia, we've still had late 20s and about 30 today but still a few below everywhere else. I don't know why but I'm not complaining. Actually, I am complaining, it's still to bloody hot.    Thank goodness, later Sunday we will have a cool southerly change which will drop temps to low 20s.

Cada um em seu mercado atende bem aos seus clientes.    Justo seria comparar os servi?os de bordo da TAM com os da VARIG, que s?o cias. que disputam os mesmos clientes e seguimento de mercados.    Essa compara??o seria sempre injusta para com a GOL, algo como perguntar qual o melhor servi?o de bordo, da Classe Econ?mica ou da Classe Executiva. S?o coisas incomparveis.|`|639e052809f5ca208541cac8f39a27d1aa	FAla serio!! A gol tem servi?o de bordo??? barra de cereal!!!!!

(alis, pode ser que minha resposta nem tenha nada a ver com sua pergunta...)  Bom, eu nunca viajei de Gol, mas j ouvi falar do servi?o de bordo, as famosas "barrinhas de cereaais", que realmente as pessoas acham ser algo meio simplrio, comparado com outras companhias areas como a Tam, a Varig ou companhiasque seguem v?os internacionais. A sua pergunta foi clara: qual o melhor servi?o de bordo. Com certeza todo mundo que j voou pelo menos Tam, vai responder Tam. S vai responder Gol a pessoa que s viajou BRA ou que teve a infelicidade de pegar um v?o da Tam num dia de lanche ruim (para seu gosto, claro). O que as pessoas n?o podem, de maneira alguma,  esquecer de que o servi?o de bordo  apenas um complemento de todo o v?o. A Tam  uma excelente companhia area, pode ter overbookings, mas  uma empresa sria, que leva em conta a seguran?a de seus passageiros, e seu objetivo  levar o passageiro com seguran?a ao seu destino. Isso  inquestionvel. Tanto quanto a Gol: por ser nova no mercado, a Gol  hoje (acredito eu) uma das melhores companhias areas para se voar, ela preza (e muito) para a seguran?a de seus passageiros. Os pilotos da Gol seguem as normas de seguran?a exigidas  risca. At hoje, eu s vi uma aeronave da Gol decolar e apresentar problemas: foi no aeroporto de Congonhas-SP, quando na decolagem, a turbina ingeriu pssaros, e o avi?o teve que retornar e pousar. Ou seja: n?o foi uma falha tcnica da Gol, foi uma falha da natureza, onde todos est?o sujeitos.  Desculpe se eu sa do teor da sua pergunta, mas normalmente as pessoas n?o vem o que acontece nos "bastidores", digamos, de um v?o. S queria expor minha vis?o e chamar a aten??o para um item muito mais importante do que o servi?o de bordo.|`|b97357a65def7bee42a26e361cc6af2daa	Vai de TAM amigo...

Pra incrementar a coisa, uma bela piscina, rea verde, sala de jogos, biblioteca... isso  o que existe em muitos albergues do mundo e o Brasil n?o foge a regra.   ......Ficando em um albergue voc pagar uma diria menor que em outros tipos de hospedagem e vai estar com um galera que "fala sua lngua" (n?o necessariamente o mesmo idioma, pois os turistas estrangeiros s?o os que mais os freqentam).  Os quartos de albergues tm geralmente beliches e armrios com cadeados para cada leito. Em boa parte deles h quartos masculinos e femininos, mas em alguns estabelecimentos homens e mulheres ficam no mesmo ambiente e utilizam o(s) mesmo(s) banheiro(s) (em momentos distintos hein?!). Os albergues tm cozinha equipada com no mnimo fog?o, pia e geladeira e alguns tem mquina de lavar roupas (que geralmente  alugada para o hspede, assim como roupas de cama), alguns tm computadores com acesso  Internet (funcionando como um cyber-caf), sala de TV etc.  Claro que existem albergues simples, onde s h os quartos, banheiros e recep??o; mas, sempre d pra dar uma incrementada, a alguns donos criativos servem o caf da manh?, incluso na diria!    ......Alguns albergues tm reas e/ou quartos destinados a famlias e casais. Basta se informar antes com o estabelecimento pra saber da possibilidade, inclusive de levar crian?as.    Albergues da Juventude e Albergues independentes    ......No Mochila Brasil/GHEB.net voc encontra os dois tipos.

De qualquer forma, at os Albergues da Juventude aceitam n?o alberguistas (caras como voc, que n?o tm a carteirinha que d direito a pelo menos um pre?o diferenciado), muitos n?o admitem isso, mas... afinal, precisam pagar suas contas no final do ms.    ......Pra muita gente, o fato de ficar com cinco, dez desconhecidos no mesmo quarto por uma ou mais noites parece um tanto louco; pra outros  super natural at para os mais anti-sociveis, o que prova que o negcio  "revolucionrio"!|`|3a4b66d0375e747fa10a80a9c9e0b080aa	Acesse o site www.hostel.org.br/,  da Federa??o Brasileira dos Albergues da Juventude.

PFCfKKtSaa	yes i'm sure you would be allowed. as i remember one time when i travelled on a plan two people behind me brang homemade food that STUNK horribly.|`|Uxd7mmMPaa	yes you can.  But if you are flying international you have to make sure you eat it before you get off the plane, especially things like fruit and vegies.  I would advise a sandwich over a salad as you can chuck the wrapper in the bin, if you take a container some countries may take it of you when arriving if there is still food in it.|`|5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	yes, but be careful of liquids on the sandwich. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich may no be allowed, too much mayonnaise on a sandwich, same with salad dressing. I stick with granola bars or protein bars - they take up less space also.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	YES! Although TSA might tell you that if the put it in a blender it will become a liquid, or they might try to take it from you so they can eat it.    I'm only kidding :)|`|zoJmDBpUaa	Yes, sure, why not?|`|WHszC08Qaa	actually you can in america take food on the plane but you can't going from mexico to america  ... so long as it doesn't have a bomb in it|`|NU7h0H4iaa	If you bring edible shorts/underwear do u think they wiill throw it out. I guess not. SO i presume edible self made sandwiches wouldn't be a problem as well !!
VxfyQZ2jaa	The JazzFest is held at the Fairgrounds, which is not within realistic walking distance of downtown,  There are are not any hotels close to the Fairgrounds.     Best is to stay at a hotel in the French Quarter, Central Business District, or Warehouse District.  That was you are within walking distance of everything downtown.      There is limited parking at the Fairgounds.  DO NOT try to park in the neighborhoods arounf the Fairgrounds.  The area is safe, but scores of Parking Control Agents and dozens of Parking Control tow trucks will be combing the area looking for illegally parked cars to take to the impound lot. It is a residential neighborhood and the residents have complained for decades about cars blocking their driveways, etc. during JazzFest so the City responded with "zero tolerance" parking enforcement.     Many hotels operate shuttles to the fairgrounds for JazzFest, Grey line operates them, and the transit authority can also get you there:    http://www.graylineneworleans.com/  www.norta.com    There are lots of taxis (you will have to pay the "special event" rate):    http://www.unitedcabs.com/id1.html    The JazzFest website has a link for hotels:    http://www.nojazzfest.com/    Another option is to rent an apartment via New Orleans Bed & Breakfast:    nobba@cox.net  888-240-0070/504-561-0447    There are literally thousands of restaurants.  Call first to see if a reservation is impartant during JazzFest:    http://bestofneworleans.com/gyrobase/Din...     Hope you have a great time!

VxtSO8BGaa	"Hi"....actually it's pretty easy ! Firstly I wouldn't bother with renting a car as when you get to Whistler you walk everywhere anyway or ski !    The Village is pedestrian friendly with all the amenities, Pubs, Food , Shops etc so you again won't need a car and besides there is no place to go except to Squamish or the two hour drive back to Vancouver ! *lol*!    Ok...lets get you to Whistler from the Airport itself and that will be on Pacific Coach Lines and here's their web site........  http://www.pacificcoach.com/    May as well throw in a Whistler Web Cam for you too.......  http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/weather...    When you look at the Gallery you'll see why you don't need to rent a car . I might add also that the Sea to Sky Highway is a rather interesting road at times...*lol*...if you haven't driven it before, and it's spectacular !     As concerns the Flight from Virginia to B.C. I can't help you there except to say to get a Travel Agent to do the looking for you, they don't charge you for the work and may be able to get you a package wherein it includes the hotel in Whistler and also Lift Tickets ! The Internet is fine but not as good as an agent for really scouting out good deals.    Glad to help and have fun and a "Welcome to Canada"! *S* (Michael C...)    **************************************...  EDIT...."Hi" Kristen....I think you're gonna find the Seattle Whistler trip with Canada customs etc. to be about 6 perhaps 7 hours ( 354 kms each way )and entail a bit of fuel purchase ! *S* If you can think of it I'd  love you to E Mail me with the exact time if you remember...Have fun and you'll love Whistler ! *S*|`|AA12095483	You can't fly to Whistler - you'll have to fly to Vancouver and the best way to go to Whistler once you reach the airport, is take a bus. There are charter buses or Greyhound buses. If you're planning to stay in the village at Whistler, you won't need a car while you are there.|`|AA11663627	My boyfriend and I are actually leaving for Whistler tomorrow. We found it to be about $200 cheaper per ticket to fly into Seattle (from Minnesota) and then drive the extra 2-3 hours to Whistler. I think it's about a 4 hour drive total depending on how long it takes to drive thru Seattle and Vancouver. We're using the money we'd save to rent an SUV. I know I wouldn't be interested in riding on a bus or train. That's just me though. Once you get to Whistler though I don't think having a car is really necessary. So look into flying into Seattle and see what you might save.
XoE6TM5paa	I'm going to San Diego for Spring Break too, and I just have to say that if you want to see some truly amazing spring break sights... Head down to Tijuana, Mexico for a day (or more). Not sure where Ensenada is but probably close. Tijuana is only an hour away though (if the border isn't too jammed up). Another thought though, because Disney land isn't as exciting when older, is six flags... TONS of roller coasters, each of which are amazing (not much of a drive to get there either). Besides that there are the old standbys of Sea World, the San Diego Zoo, or even the beach (cold water so early but still warm if only on the beach).     Sorry if that was too much of a rant. Have fun.|`|rg7dxjC3aa	Balboa Park! Hit it up! there is always something going on, events, street performers, etc Balboa Park is free to enter, but costs to go to the museums and things. Great restaurants there, too.. Also, check out the Zoo and Sea World.
CJRon7Fcaa	To get a visa, first the company has to get a work permit from the labour ministry. I am surprised that they offered a job to you without first getting a work permit. After the work permit is obtained they need to apply for a visa which takes about a week. The work permit also should take a week if they have all the papers in order. Including the processing time in the office the maximum time line is 3 wks.|`|DSVUvfGuaa	That depends on your employer and how is big his interest i bringing you to Oman.

wVJ1jAyJaa	It is not automatic. They have to go through similar procedures as other foreigners.|`|aVJyU3Tjaa	As far as I know, yes. But I guess the rules aren't that clear, because the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is only recognised by Turkey. But, yes, I'm pretty sure the Turks can move freely between Northern Cyprus and Turkey.|`|50zbKv0jaa	until the Cypriots get their country back then you will be evicted as a hated invader who destroyed their country    only turkey recognizes the Turkish Cypriot republic|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Not as long as Turkey has Constantinople/Istanbul|`|AA10604976	Do the Brits have a right to move to Cyprus? Do Greeks have a right to move to "free and independent and bla bla bla" Cyprus?    You have to have an all encompassing rule, else you may be suspected of racism.|`|nilXrNcHaa	Why not? Do Brits have the right to move from England to America? Cyprus origianlly belong to Turkey until we lost it due to war BUT a small part of Cyprus does remain to the Turks though no one sees this, everybody thinks Cyprus is Cyprus.    Turkey sees Cyprus as North Cyprus and South Cyprus, north belonging to the Turks and South to the greeks and there are MANY Turks living in Cyprus so ofcourse Turks have the right to move from Turkey to Cyprus if they choose to since there is also a Turkish embassy there as well.|`|zm2zlbO7aa	no, but they do anyway|`|l3z9mntEaa	I 'm cypriot and Iive in Cyprus. You can do this for sure after Turkey become a member of EU . Now it's impossible unless you get married with a cypriot citizen. As for tourists I have seen turkish tourists here last summer and I know also cypriots traveling to Turkey-usually to Instabul.
Il0QA1Hcaa	Most luxurious resorts do this in case of there is any damage done to the room. As well as any charges that acquire during the room. These hotels provide room service which is added to your bill, you do not pay at the time of delivery. Also check and see if they have a resort fee which will also be taken out of this money as well. If you do get room service I would keep all receipts and take pictures of the room when you arrive as well as what the room looks like when you check out if you want to see any of that refund back.
d4b0db53e729c2238afeb4b26de95ff4aa	You should get the JR East Train pass at home, outside of Japan.  I live in the US, and we can buy it at almost any travel agency.  It will give you unlimited rides on ride all the JapanRail trains, incuding the Shinkansen (Bullet) trains.      It cost about US $300.00 per person, half that for kids.  Don't buy the green pass for the luxury train cars, it's not worth it.  The regular cars are great.    When you take the bullet trains, just get on and find a seat.  They always ask if you want a reserved seat, but this is not necessary, except for the big holidays like Golden Week (April 28th to May 5th), and the month of August when everyone travels.    They make a big deal of saying the JR RailPass is not good for the Nozomi trains, which are the fastest.  The Nozomi trains include about a US $50.00 surcharge, and run from Tokyo to Osaka in 2 and 1/2 hours.   The other trains take 3 hours, and some of the local trains may take 4.      The trains all have telephones, Wifi, stewardesses serving food and beverages, and they are all fun to ride.      Have a great time!|`|LrGhFAkkaa	Hi. It depends a bit when you go. If you are going there when there is a national holiday I would buy tickets in advance. Remember that if you are going to buy a JR railpass you have to buy this before you go to Japan. I'm not sure how much a ticket will cost but the train ride should take about 2 1/2 to 3 hours depending a bit on which of the bullet trains you take. Here is a Japan trip report with photos and I have written a bit about our experience when it comes to getting around on the train http://gardkarlsen.com/japan_tokyo.htm|`|eAMbWkahaa	Are you the same person spamming the entire forum asking the same question?    Price and reservation depends on when you're traveling.  If you are traveling during a major holiday in Japan it is good to reserve in advance, if you aren't then you can reserve right before the train leaves.    The price of tickets vary depending on the train taken, but it is typically around 13,000 yen.    If you are making a return within seven days, then getting a JAPAN RAILPASS is a good deal, as a Japan Rail Pass costs 28300yen for 7 days, but it has to be purchased outside of Japan.    The above person said get the JR East Pass.    THE JR EAST PASS DOES NOT WORK ON THE SHINKANSEN TO OSAKA.      The JR East Pass only works on JR East Shinkansen, the Shinkansen to Osaka is operated by JR Central and JR West.  So you need the full Japan Rail Pass not the JR East Pass.    The big deal about Nozomi trains (cannot be used with the JR Pass) is there are more Nozomi trains per hour then there are Hikari trains, so there are more departures and more direct trains depending on how far you are traveling.  There are fewer Hikari train departures per hour, and fewer kodama trains per hour.

Primero que nada, te doy idea de los costos. u$s 3000 ac son $9000 aproximadamente. Y para que tengas parmetros, un almuerzo abundante, bien servido, con la bebida incluida, te puede salir unos $30. Una entrada al teatro est entre $20 y $50. Una entrada a un museo est entre $5 y $40 segn el lugar. Una noche divertida (contando cena, viaje, entradas, algn trago) te puede costar unos $100.   Lo mejor de Buenos Aires es que en un mismo lugar y a poca distancia tens miles de atractivos tursticos. Eso quiere decir que en una misma tarde podes conocer un museo, una feria enorme, un shopping, una Avenida importante, un restaurante temtico, y una confitera paqueta. Lo peor de Buenos Aires es que hay mucha gente que se aprovecha de los turistas, y que ciertas zonas son elegidas por los delincuentes para robar. Lo que te recomienda AQUI... es cierto sobre los taxis, pero si utilizas servicio de RADIOTAXI eso se soluciona. Peds el taxi por telfono a una central desde donde te dicen cunto te va a salir el viaje, y ah no importa tu acento. Respecto a los robos, lo ms importante es pasar desapercibido y no llevar el dinero en una mochila o una cartera que sea muy facil de arrebatar. Igualmente hay zonas ms peligrosas pero otras super seguras que podes transitar tranquilo.|`|b73fdf531d5c167500d2ce9c836c3b62aa	conoce la zona llamada "La Boca" y "El Riachuelo" soy de corrientes, y cada vez que voy la reconozco desde mucha distancia, realiza una tesis, o un trabajo monografico de como descontaminar ese paisaje que si no fuera por la contaminacin reinante podria ser parte de un atractivo turistico, no se como los porte?os no ven la forma de solucionar eso??? hay tantas tecnologias!!!! suerte es la mejor denuncia que puedes hacer para el mundo.....|`|1d60d1af7163eb555c5bd039af515d62aa	buen tema seria el cementerio de recoleta,el prostbulo cocodrilo,la contaminacin del riachuelo,la isla maciel,los fideos de fechora,el planetario de buenos aires,el museo de ciencias naturales de la plata,temaiken,la reserva ecolgica de la ex ciudad deportiva de boca,plaza Francia,los bosques de palermo,la zona roja,y si no te alcanza,te das una vuelta por el cuc de Carlos paz,y para comer buena carne (asado y parrillada)date una vuelta por SIGA LA VACA , o PUNTA RECOLETA.y como guia turstico podes pedir un taxi o remise, q te cobran unos 50 dolares diarios o un escort de acompa?antes que saldr lo mismo y las chicas te dan service extra,juas.el cafe que esta frente a la plaza francia dentro de varios se llama LA BIELA.|`|8bcb7d354c13bde2c8ee4cdc741cb417aa	Recomiendo: Teatro Coln, el Museo de Bellas Artes de Recoleta y el Parque Temaiken en Escobar.

Sur Buenos Aires, faire attention aux quartiers sensibles (surtout dans le Sud de la ville).

(Je me suis fais voler mon portefeuille et mon passeport, au bout de trois mois, trois jours avant mon dpart, le seul jour o j'ai baiss ma garde!!)

Mais en dehors de Buenos Aires, les gens sont plutot tranquilles.    De toute facon, comme dans n'importe quel pays un peu fragile conomiquement, ne montrez pas trop vos signes de richesse.
