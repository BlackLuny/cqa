AA12068233	I love the Vortex. You can't go wrong there.<br>  <br>  I also like No Mas! Cantina. It's a Mexican restaurant with a really cool interior. Savage Pizza in Little 5 has a great pizza so you could have a few slices there and walk across the street to Front Page News, also. <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|4bedkpvLaa	Persepolis Persian Cuisine<br>  6435 Roswell Rd NE # B<br>  Atlanta, GA 30328<br>  <br>  (404) 257-9090?<br>  persepoliscuisine.com<br>  <br>  This is one of my and my coworkers favorite restaurants.

KKBLVOaIaa	I would keep him as a pet for sure.  I can't actually think of an abusive EX, but a tiny person would be the creepiest pet ever, and I'd probably get onto some morning talk shows and stuff.  |`|eaf9b8bbef673b36a962dc414a7dddc9aa	why is this in dinning out do you want to eat him|`|I7gOLwQbaa	didnt you ask this already|`|AA10266064	hang him on a banana tree and laugh at him with my friends, he would be like the office pet=== hanging there from a banana tree, doesn't that make you laugh, i don't care if your question is in the wrong category, somtimes you find the best things where you least expect it and you gave me a great laugh just picturing it :)|`|zeY23zz2aa	be scared then think "i must be messed up" |`|Wv592rOqaa	I'd give him a handi-wipe and a plastic bag for droppings.  eeewww|`|5bb9b54dd90c3d4eacb9a814671b6596aa	kick her|`|UiIkUAy7aa	i will say hi and wave my hand
xehmM1CHaa	Shoes back on, feet off the table.  |`|cRwuYzipaa	Omg that is such a dumb question! I would do nothing, because all she is doing is sitting there! with her shoes off. u r kinda weird.|`|AA10266064	yeah, i think i would just tell her to put her feet down, people put food and drinks there, but what was more concerning is the other videos that came up when we go to the link and it has a bunch of foot videos and i can't help but look, eeeeeeeeewwwwwww!!!!  Plus there is this rash called foot and mouth disease, really my friends daughter had it when she was a baby from putting her feet in her mouth after crawling.|`|eUDPfWdpaa	ewww, nasty!  Ask her nicely to put her feet down and shoes back on, tell her this is an eating establishment, not her bedroom, and wash those nappy feet.|`|G3bzZzP2aa	I would say "comfortable?"|`|9NzCLWoXaa	i will tell her to get her dirty feet off the table that this isnt her house|`|ixdjFPPMaa	I would tell her to get her feet off of my table and then hand her a Clorox wipe.  
liWJL1Pyaa	A meal of fish and chips isn't as unhealthy as you might think. It has approximately 750 calories which is not as bad as many meals in burger bars such as tgi's etc.<br>  <br>  If you like, you can sometimes get it done in breadcrumbs which reduces the calories further.|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Nothing is actually healthy but I  suppose you could take the batter off the fish, have no chips and a small portion of mushy peas...|`|ffEDoIN1aa	Quite a few sell baked potatoes which are pretty healthy or roast chicken pieces.  To be honest though i think you should just eat what you are meant to eat be it battered fish or chips or whatever.  It's not worth going back to Rhodes Farm for the sake of one meal is it, honestly?  Get well soon x|`|LjBbJCxHaa	unfortunately nothing is healthy as it is all deep fried.  sometimes chippys do boiled rice which is the healthiest and i would top that off with a smidgen of curry sauce.<br>  <br>  If not then i would get a fish and remove all the batter, with just a few chips.  mushy peas are okay too and they only give u a small carton so nott too many cals.  If u were to get this it would total  about 500 cals.<br>  <br>  good luck!! x|`|xTb8u783aa	you could try sausage  not betted and peas i'm not sure about anyting also have a nice time

Ele expressa com elegancia as tendências do chef. A estética – inspirada no design minimalista sueco –, prima pelas formas geométricas simples e pela leveza. Enquanto fatias macias de peito de pato repousam sobre um Bok Choy, um Ganache de Foie Gras – imitanto um petit gateau –, espia do outro lado do prato, separado por um fio de molho de frutas vermelhas. Ao ser cortado, um líquido se esparrama sobre a composi??o e surpreende. Com sabores delicados, acentuados por um toque de especiarias, o prato é uma obra de arte da alta gastronomia, ati?a os sentidos e eleva o espírito<br>  ://www.terra.com.br/istoegente/278/div...<br>   A estética do sabor<br>  BMW Bugatti Burberry cabelos Cadernos etíopes Cafe de la Musique Carina <br>  wishreport.ig.com.br/?tag=restaurante|`|y079auTsaa	PowerPuffGirl,<br>  <br>  Conhe?o um site onde você pode encontrar todas as informa??es que necessita sobre restaurantes em S?o Paulo, visite o site do ShopTour.
SCiY5JESaa	very good but depends where, Iowa - NO WAY<br>  New York - yes way|`|emkT1a6raa	Yes. Order a Grandma's Sicilian Pie.<br>  It is Sooo good <3|`|jU0dGPzUaa	Nope. I like regular pizza better.<br>  Sicilian is shaped weird. :/<br>  If you want that type of pizza for dinner tonight, then go ahead. I'm not stopping you. (:|`|DymaNaBhaa	Yes it is all right, not my favorite, but it will work. I think that if you want something new or different I would go for it.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	umm umm good all kinds of pizza are good. isn't sicilian the kind with the little strips of eggplant on the top. I love eggplant even though high in carbs
1kuyVotvaa	Invest in a Zagat Guide and look for the index in the back.  Find Live Music and start calling/submitting your tracks to those restaurants.  The same could be said for the Nightlife Zagat.  It will literally say:<br>  Cafe Pierre (piano, singer)<br>  Gonzalez y Gonzalez (Mexican music)<br>  <br>  That would be your best bet, I think.
tY8mx6UTaa	It really depends what he's into. <br>  <br>  You can go virtual golfing at Chelsea Piers. My boyfriend and I went there for our first day and had fun. Will probably be better with more people though:<br>  <a href="http://www.chelseapiers.com/gc01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chelseapiers.com/gc01.htm</a><br>  <br>  For laughs you could take him to a ping-pong place. There's a ping pong club in a basement in Chinatown/Tribeca that's pretty bare bones but with some great characters:<br>  <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-york-table-tennis-federation-new-york" rel="nofollow">http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-york-table-t...</a><br>  <br>  For more upscale table tennis try Naked Ping-Pong tournament, but I'm not sure if they still have those.

mzk0t6Ovaa	If you get out into Fairfax County, you should definitely check out the<br>  seafood shack in the Whole Foods at Fair Lakes.  The seafood is<br>  pristine, the chef, Joe, puts a lot of love into his food, and it's just a<br>  really fun vibe.  We were just there last night for dinner (eat there <br>  around once a week or so), and the scallops were amazing.<br>  <br>  Most people kind of turn up their noses at the thought of eating dinner<br>  in the middle of a grocery store, but the food is not to be missed.<br>  They also have a barbecue shack, wine & cheese counter, Japanese<br>  restaurant, and a wicked deli counter.  It actually makes for a great<br>  date night.<br>  <br>  I do not generally eat seafood outside of my own home, as I grew up<br>  in a family of commercial fishermen and nothing compared to home<br>  cooked.  Whole Foods at Fair Lakes is the only place other than Ray's<br>  Boathouse in Seattle that I'll eat "restaurant seafood."  Try it.  You will<br>  not be disappointed.  It really is the best seafood restaurant going <br>  these days.|`|08ecf8a68a9ab1aa3a103cd77bbf74e1aa	These are good choices in DC<br>  Black Salt<br>  <a href="http://www.blacksaltrestaurant.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blacksaltrestaurant.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hook<br>  <a href="http://www.hookdc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hookdc.com/</a><br>  <br>  Ocenaire<br>  <a href="http://www.theoceanaire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theoceanaire.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Ok Chain places<br>  Legal Seafood or McCormick and Schmitz
ak0T96CQaa	If you are ugly: Never<br>  If you are cute: maybe very rarely if the guy is desperate.|`|yMygExd9aa	Ive had a guy come up to me and tell me that I was the prettiest girl he had ever seen when I worked at the library on my college campus, but no celebrities. Even if a celebrity did do that and treated me like the dude does in this video it would be hard to take someone seriously if all they did was throw money in my direction. Money is great and all but I want love....it is nice to be spoiled every ONCE in awhile.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	with all the wierdos in the world nothing surprises me. well, it is kind of surprising that a guy would think he would impress a girl by not paying his bill but then again, I guess he thinks if he says something like that, the girl will not want to turn him in.<br>  <br>  I never heard of it.|`|dWJJ8vs1aa	never, I've never herd of that even happening, don't think about it it should not happen|`|lcUKk54taa	only in ti's video what ever you like|`|1T2qiNIvaa	Never. You get hit on, but that's a little out there.
