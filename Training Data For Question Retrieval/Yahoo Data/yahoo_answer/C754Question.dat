I recently asked on the Italian version of Y!A for some advice on making a traditional pumpkin ravioli dish ("cappellacci di zucca" from Ferrara) and an answerer gave me pictures of two pumpkins she said would work really well for the recipe, but failed to give me their names.      The emailing service on Y!A has been a bit sketchy with me lately, so I don't trust using it to ask her what pumpkins she meant. Would some of you mind identifying them for me?       I know for sure neither of them are butternut squash, as she said it wouldn't work well with the recipe, but that leaves me pretty puzzled, because that's about the extent of my "non-Halloween pumpkins" knowledge...

I've never had this before and it sounds like it might be a good thing to cook for dinner tonight.  Does anyone know of any good recipes?      Note:  I can't use salsa in it, because I don't have any.  I probably have anything else you can think of, though.

20090203115556AAQOuFG	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Good way for vegans to loose extra weight?	I am 16 and have been vegan for over a year. I have lost about 15 lbs but I am looking to loose a little bit more. I started out 127 lbs, and I am 112 lbs now. But after a while the weight stopped coming off and I just want to lose 5-10 more lbs. Going on a diet while remaining vegan would be very difficult, and I already do excercise every day. Any advice?

20081027102034AAB5qkh	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Cookie Recipe!!!!!!!!!?	as I promised heres the recipe!   (cups)      3/4 cups sugar   3/4 brown sugar   1 cup unsalted butter (i used stork)   1 large egg (i used medium)   2 1/4 cup PLAIN flour   1 tsp baking powder   vanilla essence ( i used 1/4 tsp)   and i used a TINY bit of cinnamon   and i used a TINY bit of almond extract (its soooo strong)!      by the way i HALVED the mixture because i though 30 was too many i made about 13 i think.      pre heat oven to 190 degrees      i didnt refridgerate my cookie dough i just used flour until it was think because mine was like liquid! so yeah.      i mixed all my dry ingredient (eg my) sugar and brown sugar, my flour, my cinnamon, my baking soda. i mixed it all up.      i then put in butter, egg vanilla essence almond oil. i mixed them both together.put in the chocolate chips now or chocolate chunks.  after a while start kneading it with your hands. roll them into balls and place on tin foil covered baking tray ( i advise tin foil not baking sheet because the cookies just slid right off the tin foil) after there in balls use a fork to squish them down. i did 6 a baking tray because my last cookies and spread together making 1 giant cookie. so about 3 inches apart. i cooked for 8 mins my ones on top then another 2 mins for the ones on bottom. take them straight off the try as they will ocntinue cooking since the tray is hot. i put mine on a cooler. DELICIOUS!      to make my brown sugar i used caster sugar and mixed in treacle. it took bout 3 mins to mix together. dont use a fork use a spoon and squish it all about. i made mine very light.      ENJOY YOUR CRUNCHY ON THE OUTSIDE CHEWY AND MOIST ON THE INSIDE COOKIES!      ill show the recipe on the halloween cookiees now.      enjoy the cookies! ^_^

My friend is 13 years old and weighs about 105 pounds, and she had about half a beer with dinner under the supervision of her parents. Would this be enough to get "buzzed"? She was acting very unusual and thought everything I said was HILARIOUS. We also got into an argument about colors. She told me later that she did not feel quite under control.

20090203115122AAZkPjU	Food & Drink;Entertaining	Princess Party Decor?	We will be celebrating my daughter's first birthday in 24 days. I have already bought alot of decorations for the house such as a prop princess castle from Shingdiz, pink paper lanterns to hang on the ceiling, apothecary jars filled with pink candies, tiaras, boas, etc. So, it is very girly. I'm needing help decorating the outside leading into the house. Also, what should I put on my door? I'm thinking something cute but I'm not very creative I would rather buy it unless it's fairly easy to make such as a castle door sign "welcome to Mercedes birthday"? Any Ideas?   What about for the entrance something girly? Sparkly sticks in the ground? Something to lead to the front door. I would really appreciate your help. No rude comments please. Thank you!!

20081118133334AAv7mi8	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	18 digit Pepsi Stuff codes?	I got a Pepsi Stuff cap the other day that has 18 digits instead of 10. It's broken into 4 lines. The top line has 4 digits, the 2nd has 5 digits, the 3rd has 5 digits, and the 4th has 4 digits. I've tried entering it on the Pepsi Stuff site but it won't let me because it's too long and I've tried different combinations using only 10 of the 18 digits but nothing works. Normally I'd just give up and it's only one point, but I was just wondering if anyone else has run across any 18 digit codes and if anyone has gotten them to work.
