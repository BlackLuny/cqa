20061123052943AAXYoo1	Sports;Basketball	I beilive Jeter was robbed?	so i have already asked this question    but when u say justin mornea deserved MVP because he was the reason why they made the playoff    i dont beliver that , what about Joe Mauer (AL batting champ), Michael Cuddyer, Tori hunter  these are great players u cnnot say that they wouldnt have made the play off w/o Mornea they had talent on offence and defence   Where as this year for the yankees, matsui, shieffield, and cano were hurt in the season, A-rod on a slump, and our only player left  jeter, jambi, and damon .      The only cinsistent player we had was jeter so i do belive that he should won the MVP     while MN had good offense dont forget the did have a better pitching team than yankees this year   starting with MVP santana, and could have been rookie of the year franciso lariono   so didnt give the bullshit that Minnesota couldnt have made the playoff w/o justin mornea    thats why i personally beliet that DJ should have been MVP

I'm a mother who loves my child and i do spend lots and lots of time with him. we DO play building blocks and cars, and watch learning videos together and he is very very smart! he is even bilingual and he is not of two different ethnicities. HOWEVER, he's a little boy and he loves to play with the kiddos two times a week where he attends mothers day out. i'm just interessted if there's any sports for children age 3 in the central part of texas. I'm not being a lazy mom, I'm being a mom that wants my child to have fun, learn to play by the rules, and also give him reasons to be proud of himself simply for TRYING. SOOO...with that said. Does anyone know of any sports or links that there might be for little boys age 3 to play sports. Racing, soccer, football, etc. If you have links then please send them to me. Thanks so much!!

I feel like im doing fine, but everyone else is just better. I'm trying so hard and i go home everynight and practice more, even after our two hour practice, but nothing works. I just feel really stupid, and like I want to quit, but at the same time I don't. We haven't had our first game yet, but i'm just really feeling down.

20081105085241AAB6GPA	Sports;Martial Arts	What martial art should I do?	Now before you begin, I am fully aware that each martial art is personal, and something that I should decide myself after a thorough thought. So I have narrowed my list down to Taekwondo and Jujutsu.      Im 13 years old, I'm roughly 5 feet eight inches (175 cm) tall and roughly 110 lbs, (50 kg). I have pretty long legs, I'm skinny and have quite an athletic build.       I know Taekwondo focuses on kicks, so it would be a plus for me, but also, I've heard that Jujutsu bases alot on leverage (Or was it just Brazilian JJ?), which my long limbs or whatever would help.   I'm starting martial arts for two obvious main reasons, self-defence,  and keeping myself fit, maybe a bit more for fitness though.      So if you could help me make a choice, or maybe recommend some other martial art, it would be really nice. Also, I know the bits of info about me may not help much, so if you can't choose, if you've done either martial art, could you tell me some of their contents, because you can't compare the use of internet info, to human info.

20081106093849AACed3p	Sports;Basketball	Well I was watching sportscenter and they said?	That Joe Dumars of the pistons made a great move getting Iverson, and I agree, but they said at the end of the season, they think he will sign Lebron, and either Bosh or Boozer.      If so, they will in my opinion, be the best team in the NBA. I mean really, they can either Trade Tayshaun and get some more, or keep him as a great Sixth Man, AND they would have a line-up like this.         1 - Allen Iverson   2 - Rip Hamilton   3 - Lebron James   4 - Boozer/Bosh   5 - Sheed      What do you guys think ? Can they get them as free agents ?      I think Lebron will be going with the NYK or the Brooklyn Nets.

The highest I am doing right now is running at 10 mph at 3% incline for about 45-60 sec and that's a killer. If it's not that then I run at 12 mph at 0% incline for the same amount of time.      FREE DAY is I go to the gym but I do whatever I want, even if it's walking on the treadmill at 2 mph, lol anything but I stil go.      My goal is to burn the fat covering my abs. I can see them just a little bit, but there's improvement needed.      Do you think this is a good workout? I am open to any suggestions, ideas or comments that's why I am asking. If you think you know something I may not then please share. I want to improve my workout.      By the way I am 16 female and pretty short (5''1) so I don't have a long stride.
