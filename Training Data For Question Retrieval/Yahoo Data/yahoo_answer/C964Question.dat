Every ones been penalized this season for excessive celebration, what makes Holmes so different?   4)  Kurt Warner's "fumble" which was clearly not a fumble, was never reviewed and every questionable Play should automatically be reviewed withing the last 2 minutes, that took away the Cardinals last chance to win it.   5)  Or the Holding call against the Cardinals, you gotta be kidding me   6) And then you got the disgusting actions of Harrison, you can;t tell me a ref did not catch that..

20090202224145AAOq0Tf	Sports;Football (American)	Isn't the Pro Bowl anti climactic?	Years ago the NFL Champs played the college all stars. The all stars usually got blown out but the pros played hard to avoid the embarassment should they lose. The all stars played all out because they had nothing to lose and so much to gain.   The current situation results in a glossed over, glitzy, let's-not-get-hurt-and-go-through-the-mo... Hawaiian (I just wanna be voted in the) Pro Bowl.   I usually miss the Pro Bowl because I have so little interest to know when it gets played.   They ought to have it set up so the winners of the Pro Bowl get huge bucks and the losers get nothing ... maybe then they'd play a more entertaining game than that two handed touch version of tackle football.   Maybe they could set it up so that the conference winners have a home field advantage over the losers next season. Anything to make the game more meaningful.

It is hard to buy and bring quality football players to the team, it is expensive, rent is cheaper, they are not always good, they can be in the bad condition, and it is more fun every year, different soccer players play for the position each year. It is cheap, so it can bring more great football players. like if I were Man city, rent Piqué, Márquez, Carvalho, Krki?, Gabriel Milito, Metzelder, Helguera.

If the ball is fall shoot it. If he shoot 19 for 55 I would agree but he shot a higher % in this game than anyone averages in a season. I bet if he had 15 ast and 20 point yo would be complaining he cant win without Bynum and should have lead the team and scored more      Also Gasol had 31 point aswell      LO, Farmar, Vlad, Sasha and Powell went a combined 4 for 23 so no one else had shots falling.

Also, do you think it's more of the home court advantage or the players desire to win that determines the games?      Just to note: When Celtics faced Atlanta at Boston, the Hawks get killed by over 15+ points, when Celtics lose in Atlanta, they lose by only a single-digit. Is that saying something about the team, or the intensity of the home court?

Here are mine      Top 5(in no particular order-of course,I always explain myself for each pick but you don't have to lol):   -Jimmie Johnson(best in the series right now.besides,he won the last 3 lol)   -Carl Edwards(Johnson said it best on his NASCAR Now interview today-Carl learns from his mistakes and betters himself every year)   -Jeff Gordon(I don't believe the 4 time champion is washed up-he will make a comeback in 2009)   -Matt Kenseth(he is always consistent-if he can pull out some more wins,especially during the Chase,he will be a major threat)   -Kyle Busch(I am still not convinced he is as good as his 2008 stats,but if he can be half as succesful as last year and improve his Chase run,he could very well be the champion)      other threats:      Kurt Busch(if Penske can give this guy some good equipment,he will be a 2-time champion)      David Ragan(this guy gets better every year and he completed more laps than any other driver last year.If he can find victory lane this year,he will find a Chase berth and a legitimate shot at the title)      Mark Martin(the 5 car hasn't ran that well in a while,but if anyone can give that team a good chance at the title,Mark can)      Dale Earnhardt,Jr.(If he can run the entire season the way that he ran the beginning of 2008 and have some better luck,he will be a true threat for the championship)

20090203000859AAlVNLW	Sports;Baseball	Manny Ramirez turns down Dodgers second offer, Do you think he will sign with the Giants?	I for sure thought he would end up with the Dodgers but know Im not sure because another team like the Giants or Nationals could offer him a multi-year deal or offer him a 1 year deal with incentives that could lead to a 2 year deal.      Ramirez has turned down the Dodgers' one-year offer, Dylan Hernandez of the Los Angeles Times reports.      Hernandez lists the New York Mets, San Francisco Giants and Washington Nationals as teams that are monitoring Ramirez' market.      The Dodgers could find themselves in a bind if Ramirez receives a multi-year offer from another club. If Ramirez is offered what he considers a fair deal, sources close to him say that he wouldn't grant the Dodgers a chance to match it, forcing the Dodgers to go into Spring Training without their only star attraction and reliable run producer.             http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/m...

20090203022857AAmlg9Z	Sports;Football (American)	Are you ashamed of most NBA fans?	I know I'm asking this in the football section, but I find the basketball section is among the most juvenile around here. It's a total Kobe/Lebron love fest. The NBA is totally about finding the next Jordan, and I'm sick of it. David Stern has encouraged fans to carry on this attitude, by blatantly having the refs favor these stars with the calls.      I really hate the NBA, and I wish someone would start a rival league or force Stern out. It's just unwatchable.

20090203005842AAwBakB	Sports;Tennis	Do you think Federer is low on confidence when he comes to face Nadal?	I Personally think Federer can beat anyone on his prime. the problem for Federer is that he is mentally weak when comes to face Nadal considering the fact he lost to him in 5 matches in row in past few months and low on confidence which is the obvious reason he couldnt able to overcome Nadal in Australian open.   Remember his serves were working pretty well all around the week but he couldnt reprise his magical serve against Nadal and his Serves suddenly appears to be fragile in the final and he too admitted that he didnt serve well.    Looking back at the final AO. it could have resulted in either way.though it was avery close match, Federer body language was not up to the mark and bit tensed and nervous everytime he goes on to serve.  and tell me how many times Federer had his chances but he couldnt capitalize it eventually. for instant Federer broke Nadal serve twice in first set but in reprisal Nadal went on to broke him thrice. so these Federer malfunctioning of serve did the damage to him.   and finally i think when he plays his sublime tennis and his all guns come blazing he can beat anyone even Nadal

20090203014218AAxBlmS	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Fernando Torres running the show?	I'm a Liverpool fan and a fan of Fernando Torres, but something worries me about the striker situation at Liverpool. It seems like Fernando wants to be the only striker in town and feels uncomfortable with rivals to his mantle. Just look at his distain for Robbie Keane and then see that the Irish international (not to mention the only other recognised striker at Anfield) has been bizarrely sold back to Tottenham for much less than he was bought for. This coupled with the fact that Andriy Voronin is on loan and that Benitez has hardly been searching for Keanes replacement tells me that Torres might want to be the lone striker at Liverpool and that what Torres wants Torres gets under Benitezs regime.      Thoughts please

But then I found out that Breast Stroke and 400 to 800 metres running is my natural talent, I mean, I always win these races in most competitions, and my other strokes are all fast, but not CRAZY fast like Breast Stroke. I have great durability and can RUN not jog 800 metres in 2 minutes and 34 seconds in my quickest personal record so far.      Furthermore, idk why, I just like training Breast stroke as it kinda makes me feel free for some reason, due to the speed. Plus it' s less tiring then the other strokes.

Questo arbitro è stato cancellato dai ruoli.   Altri arbitri (Ayroldi, Farina, Recalbuto, ecc.) hanno invece paurosamente danneggiato il Cagliari a favore di Juve, Milan, Inter, Roma, Reggina   Nessuno di questi è stato radiato.

20061120142547AA5w2wS	Sports;Basketball	Lakers: I think they should trade Chris Mihm for?	Ryan Hollins,because it looks like Chris will always be hurt for the next two or three years, corcenniing Ryan Hollins, Phil J. would put Ryan in his wings, and  good things could happen for Ryan as a laker, both ends of the floor. If Ryan had gone to another school, he would have been know as an enfenseive player and defence instead of defence. What happen to Ryan at UCLA is what happen to a player (I can not remember his name) at UCLA, when Larry Brown was Coach.
