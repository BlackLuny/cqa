My computer is marked with DVD+RW DL   it also is marked with DVD MULTI RECORDER   I have made videos and copied them on to disk, but the disk will only play on my computer and not in my home dvd player, i have the same problem when i copy music, it will only play on my computer and in nothing else....   also when i go to burn a dvd, with windows DVD maker I cant find any DVD burner in the drop down list....   Basically do i even have a DVD burner on this computer...?   Its all very confusing to me.   can someone explain why it says DVD multi recorder on the side if it wont burn a DVD for me...   Is there a way to burn a DVD with the hardware I have or do I have to go and buy a separate DVD burner???   Am I using the wrong type of disk to record onto??   why is there no DVD burner in the drop down list on windows DVD maker, if I do infact have the right hardware already...maybe someone can explain that to me???

20090223141858AAq2Vxr	Computers & Internet;Software	About Limewire. Why Wont mine work? 10 pts. best answer!?	I have used Limewire many times at other peoples houses. I recently got high speed internet at my own home and decided to download limewire on my computer and start from there ( I had dial up before so limewire never worked). Anyways, It downloaded fast and i was super excited to start...Here is the problem, the little connection bars at the bottom left wouldnt go past the first connection bar...therefore leaving me with really no connection and i couldnt download music. I thought it was just my computer so i tried it on my brothers laptop, same thing. Desktop computer, same thing. So someone told me about imesh, i downloaded it fine and IT WORKED!! So, i happily downloaded albums at a time and i was super excited, until it wouldnt let me put it on itunes :(   and it also was going to make me pay 99 cents a song once i downloaded a certain amount :(  It also automatically put all of the songs on my windows media player, which i thought "okay at least i can burn cds" but when i tried it was telling me that i needed to buy the burn rights so the songs for like 99 cents which was pretty much like buying it. I might as well just use itunes if i am going to pay 99 cents for it. So i deleted it and i am just uin a state of confusion. I love limewire and i really would like to have it again!! Someone told me about a firewall or something but i am not really sure if that is the problem with it because i tried taking it off, but maybe i didnt do it right!? If anyone has any ideas as to why Limewire wont get a full connection in our house, please let me know and help me figure out this problem, i will give you 10 points for the best answer THAT WORKS! Thanks so so much!

20090223135959AABS51z	Computers & Internet;Software	I need Help with a serious Vista problem!?	Ok, here we go. I'm working in m friends Acer computer, which runs Vista Home Premium. She had the whole blue screen thing going on, which I have seemed to fix. But, he had been running around with no virus protection for about three years. When I finally sat down and installed some, it found a trillion different things. I then installed spybot, which had a hay day. The computer then continually flashed the cmd at me at start up. It kept saying, "c:\windows\system32\ntdll.dll" is corrupt. I uninstalled spybot, and decided it was time for a wipe. I reformatted, and all that good stuff, and then, out of the blue (Literally), the computer crashed. I hadn't even gotten to the desktop. Windows came back and said that I should install windows service pack 1. So after finally getting in and settling, windows bugged me for updates. So I started them, but the computer kept freezing. Then the computer restarted, and tried to do the updates again. But then it crashes, and sends me straight to recovery! I'm in a loop. I was lucky to get back in and type this question! D: Windows checked for a problem, and guess what it said was the root of it? "c:\windows\system32\ntdll.dll" So Ive reformatted, and this problem hasn't gone away. I do not have a vista disk. The computer seems to have a problem booting up and installing updates, and I'm simply not sure what to do any more.       I'm pretty sure everything that happened is here, but so much has happened, I could have left something out.      Please Help!

In Pinellas County. I posted an ad on craigslist to sell my Verizon Blackberry smartphone. This guy offered me money then asked out of curiousity why i didnt want the phone anymore. i told him it was under a roommates name and she didnt pay the bill so the service got cut off. he bought the phone with this knowledge and i have proof in a text message that i told him this information. now he is threatening to call the police. and mentioned something about a lemon law. well i tried looking it up and to what ive seen there is no lemon law for cellphones. then he said its in the fine print in craigslist and when i looked at craigslist it says they do not offer 'buyer protection'. he said its a fraud because the phone doesnt work. but the PHONE works perfectly. i told him i sold him a PHONE not a service plan. i did not at ANY point tell him he could reactivate this phone with verizon. is there any legal action he can take? i asked 2 friends, and they said no.but i wanted to ask a broader range of people.

"oh yea, its a virus". That was on the 17th I think. So I just downloaded a link from another questions that I found (I've searched this many times on here, but nothing seems to work). It detected it, well it detected two, and I found the pictures its called U or something... and I tried to delete it but it won't let me. It says its been deleted, I rebooted and everything but its not. I know that because when I go onto my MSN conversations pop up for like, less than a second, then they go away. I've warned people not to click it but now I can't talk to anyone, and I know some people have clicked it.   Another site would be great, or like a detailed list of things I should do.

It says it is 266MHz DDR SDRAM.  I always see DDR memory and SDRAM.  Is there a kind called DDR SDRAM? Or does this just mean that it can take either one?  Why is DDR ram so much more expensive than DDR2 ram?      PLEASE PROVIDE LINKS TO CHEAP WEBSITES WHERE I CAN BUY THIS TYPE OF RAM!!!!!-thank you...

20070509204745AA0UvES	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	?cómo se hace para configurar el teclado?	En la computadora de mi trabajo (que utilizo con bastante frecuencia) el teclado tiene una configuración diferente al mío. Me vuelve loca porque tengo que estar corrigiendo todo el tiempo ya que la automatización que se adquiere al escribir me hace cometer errores (con los acentos, con la arroba etc.) y lo peor es que, cuando regreso y escribo en el mío, ?vuelvo a cometer los mismos errores! porque me quedo "tildada" con la configuración del otro. Por favor si alguien puede ayudarme a configurar la coincidencia de lo que figura en las teclas con lo que verdaderamente éstas producen evitará mi colapso. Gracias.

Tenía una película en mi disco duro y quise pasarla a un CD (no tengo grabador de DVD), como la película informaba que su tama?o esta de 699 MB, supuse que entraría perfectamente, sin embargo después de hacer todo el proceso que dura bastante tiempo, me apareció un mensaje que decía que ?no había espacio suficiente en le disco!   ?por qué si 699 cabe en 700?  Tendré que resignarme a no poder pasar películas en CD? Me ocurrió lo mismo con una de 700... dirán que parezco Homero Simpsons, pero no podía aceptarlo sin explicación, por favor alguien que me ayude antes de que siga probando!!!!   Por suerte,  sí pude pasar "El perro Andaluz"  de Bu?uel porque es cortita.
