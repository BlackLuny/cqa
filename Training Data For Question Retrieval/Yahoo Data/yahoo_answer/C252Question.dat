20061121071855AAC8pAE	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Para los Fans de 'El Se?or de Los Anillos' | Ya supieron la MALA MALA noticia?	Hoy oficialmente se confirma... o por lo menos hasta este punto... que Peter Jackson no dirigira EL HOBBIT!!!.   Quieren saber las razones? Ego y estupidez...   Como muchos ya saben, Peter fue de estudio en estudio buscando alguien que le confiara las peliculas, pero solo NEW LINE cinema acepto el reto. Ya finalizando la tercera pelicula y habiendose estrenado las primeras dos, era oficial que EL HOBBIT empezaria produccion un a?o despues, PERO la estupidez de Peter aparecio, dispuso demandar a NEW LINE por que queria mas dinero en regalias y con un trato ya firmado por el, y puso una demanda q hasta hoy sigue. New Line esta listo para produccion, pero Peter dice que no hasta que le den mas dinero. New Line solo tiene un corto tiempo para empezarla por los derechos con la Metro.    Peter en realidad necesita EL HOBBIT.. despues del ladrillazo del KING KONG le quitaron presupuesto para HALO. Peter no tiene mucho ahora.   Pero su ego esta primero antes que el mejor trabajo de su carrera!! CREO!

Einer der Freunde hat einen Unfall (ich glaube einen Motorradunfall) und kommt ins Krankenhaus. Er ist sein Leben lang an den Rollstuhl gefesselt und total depressiv deswegen. Im Krankenhaus lernt er einen anderen Rollstuhlfahrer kennen, der ihn total aufmuntert und immer gut gelaunt wirkt. Er scheint damit überhaupt kein Problem zu haben dass er an den Rolstuhl gefesselt ist. Als er entlassen wird beginnt er selbstmord.

20070703073026AAJoLHx	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Que esta pasando con Pixar?   Habra perdido Pixar su magia?	Si no has visto Ratatouille, no leas esto.   EN MI HUMILDE OPINION, Brad Bird no tiene culpa por el ladrillazo que fue la historia de Ratatouille, pero por responsable d la EXCELENTE ANIMACION,  finas coreografias y visualmente a todo nivel la pelicula es excelente. Desafortunadamente desde Cars, Pixar ha estado en declive, incluso los short previos a sus peliculas no han sido tan creativos como antes... tecnicamente Pixar sigue siendo el mejor, pero el desarrollo de las historias y de los personajes simplemente no funciona, no llegamos a identificarnos, situaciones predecibles y excusas simples para llegar a algo.   En Ratatouille, (en mi opinion) las personalidades de los personajes son muy genericas, la historia es lineal. El personaje Linguini era a todo nivel una absoluta marioneta de Remi (el raton), humillando al personaje y degradandolo como un personaje totalmente inutil y sin dignidad q no demostro valor humano alguno, el solo esta para hacer bien al raton. Todo es sobre cocina

Aqui vai um pequeno exercício de calculo mental !!!! Este cálculo deve fazer-se mentalmente (e rapidamente), sem utilizar calculadora nem papel e caneta!!! Seja honesto... fa?a cálculos mentais...    Tens 1000, acrescenta-lhe 40. Acrescenta mais 1000. Acrescenta mais 30 e novamente 1000. Acrescenta 20. Acrescenta 1000 e ainda 10. Qual e o total? (resposta abaixo)    O teu resultado é: 5000 ?    A resposta certa e 4100 !!!! Se n?o acreditar, verifique com a calculadora. o que acontece é que a seqüência decimal confunde o nosso cérebro, que salta naturalmente para a mais alta decimal (centenas em vez de dezenas).

20070320140756AAodvUU	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	NEED SOME THOUGHTS please.... ++++++?	My boyfriend of over 13 months almost broke up with me. He said it was about how we raise our future kids and how we handle our future money. Our views were a lil different and he didn't want to go through a divorce someday... like he has seen in his parents and others. He doesn't have good examples to look up to like I do and he's been through a lot as a kid. So he was scared of that happening to US. I was shocked though because I thought we had already settled that before, but apparently not. We talked everything out and came to a compromise. He apologized. Everything is fine now.      I told him next time, when we have an argument, we should compromise and come to a solution and when we say it's fixed, IT'S FIXED. No more pretending it is. Then we can move on.      I seemed SO secure in our relationship. Is it weird that I don't feel as secure anymore? Now I feel like he's going to scare the hell outta me again. But we already talked this out. It's fine now, but I'm still... kinda off?

20090205123951AAQa3vd	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	Where can i find this song?	There was a song I sang in children's choir at my church many years ago. I'm trying to find it for my church's youth choir, but I'm having no luck. It's called either 'Down That Road' and 'Gather We Now.' I ordered one from JW Pepper but it wasn't the right one. (It was by Sleeth's 'Down the Road.') So if you can help me at all, please do!       These are the lyrics I can remember   "There'll be time in our lives we'll look back on the love and the laughter we've shared. And we'll start down that road once more, the road of childhood past. But for now let's make time stand still. And cradle all the love that we've shared. For these days soon will find their end, and we will go on our own. Gather we now, here as one. the memories we've shared will endure. The gifts we've received will carry us through the years, when we will go on our own."

20090205134736AAlrczu	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	"LOST" Question who will end up......?	Who do you think Kate will end up with:      Sawyer   Jack   Neither            Did you see the episode last night. "The Little Prince" It is very obvious that Sawyer loves Kate. And he is hurting. Do you think they will end up together.       Lets face it there is no chemistry between Jack and Kate.....honestly there never was. I just went back and watched the first season. But always between Kate and Sawyer. I hope if nothing else happens on this show that Kate and Sawyer can be reunited.       What do you think?          I think he really loves her.            Jack doesn't deserve Kate he is a very self oriented Jerk.       Sawyer is a Jerk but not in the same way.  Deep down he is a good guy      I honestly think she won't end up with either.       But if she ends up with Jack...I'll be ticked.       Again this is just my opinion I've just honestly never liked Jack....his character has annoyed me since season one.       But however it turns out is how its supposed to turn out       just think Jack Should have been the one to jump off the Chopper not Sawyer.       I do think Sawyer will hook up with juliet but it will be a fling and meaningless.       then Kate will show back up      I just hope they can be reunited

OK, first I have considerable amount of respect for Etta James as she is a legend, and she performs the song "At Last" the best. However on the other hand, Beyonce does not legally have to get permission from Etta James as she already go the permission from the song writer and the producer. Although it would have been an honorable and respectable thing to. Etta James may have been bitter about not getting an invitation or wasn't asked to perform at President Obama's inaguration.

From what I remember, I'm pretty sure it was not Endless Waltz or Victory 2, because the animation doesn't look like that.       I remember that there was this big, tall guy, he was dark and had blue hair. There was this other guy that kind of reminded me of Sanzo [Saiyuki Reload], althgough he was nice and an artistic kind of guy. There was this tough redhead chick, who ends up dating the artistic guy. And the main guy was this black haired loser who also appeared in the end credits, he was in love with the main villain's sister.      I remember seeing it on Cartoon Network back in 2000-2001?. I really want to know what it's called so I could watch it again; for old times sake.      (I hope someone could finally figure this out for me...)

From the romantic period I like most nocturnes, but I really dislike most etudes (I tried listening to some by Chopin).    What is your opinion about etudes, and could you suggest some, based on what I wrote before, that I might like?

I always end up picking 2 out of 4, and most of you would say that its a libra thing.. which I am, however, my mother is a Capricorn, though i don't know anything about the character traits believed to be in one, i know for a fact that she is also terribly indecisive. Doesn't that just prove that certain dominant character traits rely on Genetics.       But, then i know some would argue that its more then just a coincidence then. But the everyone equally shares the same characteristics that are distributed to the signs, so no matter your going to find one character trait of the sign you are that is very..present in your character. For instance, i think that a leo is warm hearted, But so is my mom, as i am too, (at least i hope i am), so doesn't that mean i should be more like a leo      so what i am basically asking is, can you prove to me why i should agree with zodiac signs and believe in them (like a religion), however not interfere with the 'situations' i have brought up?      (i just don't understand why people always ask questions here when its not even like..true(to an extent)
20090205151442AAhzDtZ	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Are astrology signs real?	How real are they. The descriptions fit in a little with people I know. But are they just fake or real. For example many people like reading but it says this sign likes reading. Please state your response. If you think its real don't go screaming OMG OMG OMG they shape your future! or anything junky like that. If you do say its real and give an explanation why. If you say its fake explain why.

20090205145512AAqYy9r	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Extremely hard riddle! Can you solve it?	You find a magic lamp, which you rub. A genie pops out who says,      "You get 2 wishes. You cannot wish for more wishes, and you cannot combine two remotely different things into one wish."      Then, the genie picks you up and squeezes your neck. Then, he takes your friend (who is next to you) and ties him to a tree with a knife inching towards him.       finally, the genie pulls a bomb out from behind a tree and lights it. You know that the bomb will destroy the entire world unless you wish it away.             How do you destroy the bomb, escape with your friend, and come out of the whole thing with $1 million dollars and a new car?      This is possible, and there is not some stupid answer like "you wish all your troubles away and you wish for everything you ever wanted (like a car and $1 million)

On the back there's a little info on the composer. This sentence is in it: "In a way that few composers had done since Mozart, he simply sought to write music that was beautiful and pleasing to audiences, which earned him no end of scorn from critics, musicians, composers, academics, or anyone else who might be looking for trouble."      I don't understand. XD Why would people criticize him for wanting to write music that was beautiful and pleasing to audiences?

First question: I have been playing flute for four years now, and I know my playing should not be airy anymore, but I seem to constantly go back and forth between a solid tone and airy playing. What should I do to remedy this?      Second question: Again, any flute player who is experienced should be able to properly play vibrato, but I think I play with my throat rather than my stomach. I've been trying to break this habit, but with little or no avail. How can I fix this?      Third Question: How do I play pianissimo without cutting my tone? It seems difficult.

20090205150304AAtrWXt	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Does this Scorpio guy hate me?	Hi everybody! I really need help or I′m gonna go crazy! I'm 27  and I′m an aries. I′ve a boyfriend for 9 years now, who, by the way, is a Scorpio. I work in a very large company and I′ve known another Scorpio guy for about two years now. The first time I saw him, I was shocked by his piercing eyes, but he didn't even seem to notice me. To make a long story short, I started to feel extremely attracted towards this guy who′s got a girlfriend and seems to be deeply in love with her. I began having short conversations with him, which I always provoked. Then, he seemed to notice that I was attracted towards him, and he talked to me a lot, looked me in the eyes, held hands with me while talking and really made me think he also felt attracted towards me. However, he would never behave either as a friend or as something else. He seemed to play strange games all the time. He would wait for me at the end of the day to smoke a cigarrette after work or if I asked him to wait for me, but we would many times stand by each other without saying a word. The situation was driving me crazy, so I once told him that I needed to talk to him (after about a year of holding hands while speaking and flirting quite a lot). I told him that I felt something for him and that that was not right, because I had to respect my boyfriend and also his girlfriend and himself. I told him I thought we should do as if we didn't know each other. He told me it was not necessary, he said I didn't have to stop talking to him. My words seemed to bother him a lot. He told me he loved his girlfriend and I told him that I wasn't really asking anything from him. After that, he stopped talking to me for about a week. He even seemed to despise me! Then, we casually chatted once and he asked me about my relationship with my boyfriend and he also wanted to know if things were better with my boyfriend (I had told him we were going through a bad patch). Then I told him things were better, and he seemed  very surprised. Well, after that, (four months ago), he′s been having a very strange behaviour. He sometimes seems to pretend not to notice me (but my friends and I have realized that h stares at me when i′m not looking), he has changed his routines in order not to see me at work. However, he sometimes passes by and winks at me or he touches my waist, as if he were a close friend. Some other times, he comes to me and talks to me as if he were analysing my words and my moves in order to check if I'm still there for him. When he sees that I still feel attracted (he seems to read my mind through my eyes, even if I try to hide the way I feel) he then leaves. He sometimes seems to be pretending he doesn't remember a previous conversation and some other times it seems he genuinely doesn`t remember. but, on some occasion, he will bring back into conversation something i said long ago... it′s nuts! Now, when i try to behave as a friend and hide my feelings, he seems to need to know (in a quite egotistic way) if i still feel it for him and if I approach him, he will run away and make me feel like a stalker. I′m quite an open person, and people normally seem to enjoy my company, but this guy can make me feel either incredibly special or a complete failure. he sometimes seems to care about me (in a quite strange subtle way) and he sometimes seems to hate me and be fed up with me. now, I′m trying to run away from this situation, but the smore strangely he behaves, the more it affects me.  I don't seem to have anything in common with this guy. Everybody tells me that I would never want to be with him if he were interested in me. He himself sometimes seems to think I′m 'too much' for him. To be honest, all other guys seem to think I′m an interesting and attractive girl, but this guy has never made a comment which shows his oppinion about me. It is as if he had been able to know a lot about me whereas I couldn't even state that he enjoys my company. so, What should I do? Should I try to run away, even if he realizes it′s out of desperation? should I simply ignore his behaviour so that it doesn't affect me any more? does he see me as a poor stupid girl and uses me to feel he′s interesting? I think it is really affecting me in a psychological way, and it′s making me lose my self-confidence, so i need advice!

20090205152746AA5HyQ6	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	What do you think of these lyrics?	what do you think of these lyrics:       Hi there little boys and girls (**** YOU!)    Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels    But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)    Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom    and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot    but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot    And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot    and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock    when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog    Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)    And even if they escaped and they got the cops    the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge    'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job    when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk    But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off    But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker    Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka    You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."    He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her    and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her    But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander    they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner    And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana,    and what it might do to you    So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you       Chorus: Mr. Mackey       See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)    and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man)    and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)    She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)    So kids say no to drugs (that's right)    So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)    Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)    Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?          My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?    **** NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)    Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?    Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world    If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it    Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid    and spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back    So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back    Meet Zach, twenty-one years old    After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold    and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys    and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it    Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive    and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*}    His back starts tah - look like the McDonald's Arches    He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*}    And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him    "Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"    cause they took it too, so they think it's funny    So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money    Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over    and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga    And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac    So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you       Chorus: Mr. Mackey      See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)    and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)    and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)    She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)    So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)    So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)    And there's really nothin else to say (but umm)    Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?          And last but not least, one of the most humungous    problems among young people today, is fungus    It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off,    bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it    Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff    And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..    And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)    Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair    (Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire    Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)    And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms    Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus    Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?)    cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!!)    See drugs are bad, it's a common fact    But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)    But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.    They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee    and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault    So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't,    cause I'm bad for you       Chorus: Mr. Mackey       See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)    and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)    and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask)    She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)

I am asking this in Polls and Surveys because it is usually a bit more people on. I have no idea what to do about it and I don't know. I just really like them a lot. Can anyone give me advice?

20090205154011AA7WXQc	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Does my life sound like a TV teen drama?	okay, let me explain my life for a minute or two.   Read the whole thing, it is pretty interesting, actually. i think it would make a good show. BTW, This is all 100% true... i wish i were joking with most of it to be honest...         -when i was 8, my father died, leaving my mom to raise me and my 3 sisters by herself. this left me as the only male in a house of 4 girls      -I have a dark past. when i was 12, i started abusing pills as an attempt of suicide, but obviously it didn't work. I am fine now, and i'm not "emo" or "weird"      -I am now 16, and I am a sophmore in a high school which has sophmores, juniors, and seniors, instead of the traditional 9-12th grade system      -I got my first girlfriend about 2 months ago. she was really aggressive and after 2 weeks we went to a new years party where we got naked and played around in the bathroom      -My friends don't like my girlfriend because she takes away from the little time i had to spend with them. After we started going out, I discovered that she smokes pot, and I've been trying to get her to stop.      -A few days ago, me and my girlfriend had sex for the first time, and the condom ripped. We had to get some pills called Plan B (post-sex birth control pills). We're still waiting on the results. My girlfriend is 15, asian, and hot as all holy hell.      -I was on the bus, and i was about to tell my best friend about my situation. When i said to him "i have something important to tell you when we get back to your house" he replyed with "i have something important too." i dismissed it, thinking it would be a stupid kid problem.   We got back to his house, and he told me that the girl he was about to go out with is pregnant with her boyfriend's baby (she was going to dump him, but when this happened, she changed her mind)      -I am completely in love with my girlfriend, but she worries that sometimes I only like her because i have an asian fetish. While i admit, i have a huge asian fetish, i could have my choice of many of the asians in my school, yet i chose her, and i'm with her for her personality.      ...      Sound like a TV Teen Drama?

My question is about the puppet character Saumon de Champlain, who is from Quebec. Between programs, there are brief segments featuring this puppet interacting with the human hosts of the morning programming. One of these segments features Saumon singing a lullabye (or other slow-tempo childrens'/folk song) in French while Patty, the female host, listens and sweeps up the floor behind him. I FINALLY determined today that the song is called "Balayen, Balai" (Sweep, sweep) .... and please pardon my spelling if it is terrible; I do not speak French. :-(       I was wondering if anyone is familiar with this song or if you could point me in the direction of lyrics, a downloadable version (MP3), or additional info.

20090205123721AAIRN9S	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	MILEY THE NEW BRITNEY?	a new headline showed up on comcast.net   "Miley: Media paints her as new britney"   i know britney and miley started out in disney (miley's still there)   but britney has come out of the disney shell, and i think that miley will always remain as the disney channel girl.   and plus i think her voice is really annoying and i mean britneys isnt as bad, idk i just can't see miley as the new britney...   it's just that miley is SO over-labeled...i mean for god's sake who needs their face on a glue stick?   but seriously i just CANNOT see her as a pop sensation, i mean she is right now if you wanted to say that but only for kids between the ages of 7-10 so really could you see her as big as britney? as far as the adoring fans and the admiration of most of america?

20090205120941AAmxpFC	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Capricorn guy and patience?	We been friends for a year and we both liked each other. Even we wouldn't spend time together much, just once a month. But I could tell he liked me. Yesterday we decided to hang out, he picked me up and we watched a movie in his place, cuddled. He put this song "patience" by guns n roses and sang it to me. Then we played intimately and afterwards he kind of became controlling, told me to put his pijama if I'll sleep over or he'll take me home. I hate being told what to do so I said fine, I'll go home. But I didnt want his ride so I ran out of the house, he ran after me and asked what happened, let me give u a ride, dont do this to me, etc. Well I ran anyways and he still kept calling me on a phone and I told him his a jerk, asshole and all nasty words. He didn't call me yet today. What did he mean by that song? It might as well be truth about us, I play games with him and he doesnt tell me what he wants out of me either, but when we're together, I feel he cares deeply. What should I do after this? Should I keep ignoring him or pick up and be cool if he calls me next time? Do you think he's a jerk?
