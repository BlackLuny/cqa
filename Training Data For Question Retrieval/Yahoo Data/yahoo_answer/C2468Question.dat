I'm making up my own vampires in general. I don't want the typical "you kill them like this." I want suggestions that are made up.      Right now this is all I have.   Sunlight gives them something along the lines of a bad sunburn   They are deadly "allergic" to spices of any sort.    And can be killed by...? I'm thinking vampire fangs of previously killed vampire.

I noticed that the books I read, for the most part, are what my friends/teachers have suggested, or are what is critically acclaimed, or are books that are banned, or are books written by the same authors of books in the mentioned groups. Very few of the books I read were just, for lack of a better word, random books… I want to read more random, unknown books but I want to avoid stuff I won’t like. Sometimes I look at the back, but usually they have editor reviews. So yeah… how do you find these books to read?

I was thinking maybe ' The ghost Secrets' but it doesn't seem to fit in right. heres what its about-      My story is about a girl named Ellie who sees ghosts, and they act like regular ppl. But when she tries talking to them they're too bewildered to talk back to her.      Then she meets 2 ghost twins named Amelia and Adam.       She finds out she is the life-giver to ghosts. She can give life back to the ghost witch, but loses her life in return.       Adam and Amelia were the last victims of the ghost witch, and are now trying to protect her.      Now she is on a run for her life, as the ghost witch tries to take her life. Hope that helps!      P.S. DONT STEAL MY STORY IDEA!!!!! I'm about to send it in anyways, so haha!!! =) sorry, a little hyper.

I begged our teacher to change it to "fantasy romance", or "romance", or "vampire", but she said she had her reasons for keeping it as "vampire romance".   I don't even like Twilight =( no offence to any Twilighters.   So now I'm having trouble coming up with a plot because I'm not really interested in the topic.   Any ideas? I'm desperate.

She thinks nothing of it until another stranger shows up at the Morgan Ranch, half dead, & her father sends her to stay with the Cherokee Blood Brother. A few days later the ranch is engulfed in flames, the stranger has been shot, & Peter Morgan has been beaten to death. The only thing to survive the fire is a box with a false bottom & inside a letter from her father; begging her to get as far away as she can.

A little boy misses his father badly   No matter how many times   he runs to the window   Or tries on Dad's hat or shoes.... deep inside   he already knows   Daddy would be home already   if he could be home   Even though he saw that big box   they covered with a flag   He will never believe his father is gone....   So each time he hears a car door   Each time he hears footsteps   Every time he hears a key in the lock   He'll remember how much he misses his father
20090304164713AAmnGgn	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	How should you teach a first grader learning her front walkovers to...?	Okay, I am privately training my younger sister gymnastics. She already has her handstand, backbend, kickover, back-walkover, and back handstand, and is working on her back-handspring. We've been putting off any type of thing that deals with having to stand up from some type of bridge or bend. And since she's already getting her back handspring, I think it's time to start working on front-handsprings, front walkovers, and everything else. So does any good gymnast or anyone with brains, tell me how I can teach a 6 1/2 year old how to successfully stand from a bridge/bend?   Thank you all

That the Jewish man, Benjamin Rosenbaum, was actually Sir Percy Blakeney in disguise. I think i realized who it really was when Rosenbaum had to explain to Chauvelin that he might become afraid if a fight breaks out. I found it strange that the author focused so much on Rosenbaum, and it became apparent that he would be a major character in the story. What about you? Also, what is your opinion on the cleverness of Sir Percy?

Your nicotine haze and doomsday days   Have me admiring my reflection,   In the mirror, consciousness,   Vivid description of a man unfound    Shadowy and light a meek skeleton of commerce   Wandering the rainy nights searching   For long lines of strangers draped in shrouds   Smiling dimly in the tunnel-vision of    Humanity, dirty and overwhelmed with    Exhaustion and aching limbs,   Nomadic saints looking for the last of days.

Tell me what you think and what the title should be PLZ! thanks~      A lone figure stared at the top of Guard’s Point, facing the strong wind that blew from the south where a storm was brewing. He grinned, his face cast in shadows as overhead the heavy clouds built upon each other, announcing their arrival with an occasional rumble or peal of light that disappeared as quickly as it came. The figure turned his head to the wind, robes flapping behind him as the fierceness of the wind threatened to blow him off the cliff. The waves crashed beneath him, clawing hungrily at the rocks as if rising to eat the sands of the shore, only to be pulled back by an unseen force. A challenge between the force of nature and those that try to control that power were at war; a war where there would be only one survivor- the winner. A hint of a grin touched the mouth of the man as he nodded to the oncoming storm accepting the challenge that had been laid down between them thousands of years ago. Each side had chosen it’s pawn, it’s one at hope of survival, he himself was a testament to that. He had prepared for this his entire life and soon, very soon, his plan would unravel. Carefully the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a magically sealed container. Releasing the latch, the mechanism sprang free, revealing three bottles that as he pulled them out grew in size until the three could no longer fit in one hand together. “Soon” he whispered to himself, eyes lighting up as he gently shook the bottles, showing flecks of light throughout. The only ones who could have possibly stopped him had just been “taken care of”, leaving nothing in his way. In his hand he held the power of three of the four winds, each greater than the last. Soon he would be holding the powers of the four winds themselves in his palm and no one would have greater power than he. Frowning he pocketed the three bottles and turned to slowly walk back down the hill, ignoring the sea’s angry cries at his back. That, nor the way the waves crashed onto the shore, soaking his back with sharp needles of salt, could stop him now for his plan was already in motion, no matter how much the great powers may scream their fury. With a single twitch of his fingers, the figure vanished, leaving nothing behind him as he disappeared into the darkness, already on the hunt for his newest victim- the North Wind herself.

20090306154934AABbE0O	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Do you understand how projects are successfully managed ?	I was wondering about Collins submarine computerization project.      If I am responsible for signing off the work done as safe to use, won't I try to stall people for as long as possible. Because I'd want to avoid signing things off and then finding something is unsafe.      So when someone give me a project summary, or a test plan, or whatever, won't I tend to say "This is dogshit, write six new pages". That way I buy for time.      But the final result mightn't be successful, because of all the changes which I've caused.      I would have done better to run with the original schedules.

I'm so frustrated with my English class...they make us read novels where we have to analyze every sentence to death and guess the "meaning" of the text.      I need help. How do you know what the author is trying to say? It seems so mysterious to me. How do you know that the fire in one scene, for example, is symbolic of victory or whatever? Do people just interpret the narrative according to how they see the world (i.e., they make it up), or do they base it on something else?

Then pulls me with it to the floor,    As cold as lead, I feel it pulse   My mind lost, behind closed doors    Then all at once time is dead.   The picture framed in blood,    I can not take my eyes away    O, how I wish I could   Then pain, a bounding tiger, leaps upon my chest   My heart an open wound, is torn to bloody shreds.    Then through a wave of misery    A warm slug slides down my cheek,    And all at once my vision blurs,    The tears pour down my cheeks

20090306163716AAN2Ar3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think about my story?	>This is just a couple of the first paragraphs....       “Eagle Eyes”      “Help” I use every last breath to screech out that one single word.        I shuffle around the cold floor, even though my hands and arms are bound with thick rope… trying not  to make to much of a clatter, he might hear me. The rope is cutting into my leg as I roll into a more comfortable position. Then, I wonder to myself…  is this how I will die? Certainly not! I quickly assure myself. I turn around abruptly, there he is staring at me… his eyes reach mine…    I call them “Eagle Eyes.”    Then, suddenly, bang…. A bash to the head…. I slowly drift into sleep.         “Robyn, can you hear me? Robyn.” the doctor shines a light in my eyes.   “Dad? Where am I?” I open my eyes and find my self in a small room at the University of North Carolina hospital. I look outside the window and an eagle is staring right at me.    “Your fine, you’ve just had some cuts and bruises.” my dad tells me. I can see the fear in his eyes.    “She should be fine in a couple days Mr. Sharp… I assure you.. It’s nothing serious.” the doctor winks at me as he explains the situation to my dad.    Well I can assure you, that it is serious. I am petrified at what will happen next…    “I’ll leave you two alone.” the doctor walks out with a grin on his face.  I look towards my dad.    “The doctor said they found you on the side of a road down by Chapel Hill?” my dad glared into my eyes.   He was the type of guy that would ask a single question and can get the whole story in one minute.  You see, my dad was a detective at the North Carolina Crime Scene Investigation. He was the best they had.       My dad and I live out by Dunham in a two bedroom ranch. My mother disappeared when I turned nine years old. About six years ago. She also worked for the North Carolina Crime Scene Investigation. No one knew what happened to her. Some people say she’s half way across the globe, others say she abandoned me. I know neither can be true. My dad learned to forget about that kind of stuff and realized that I was important now. He couldn’t back down.        Over the next couple of days, I began to feel better, at least physically. It was probably the dozens of drugs they had injected into me. Apparently there was a large count of lead in my blood. I threw on a tee shirt and got ready for my evaluation, just to make sure I was ready to leave. No one knew what had happened before I was found.      “Hello Ms. Sharp! How are you today?” my psychologist, Dr. Eyes asks.    “Fine.” I quickly reply.    Dr. Eyes had helped me recover during the loss of my mother.    She was also my mom’s best friend.    Dr. Eyes… I’ve always thought it was such a peculiar name.

Flying with my wings that you gave me on this rocky valley of truth. Sending flowers of beauty to the amazing mother earth. The shadows in the sky coming with a thunderous roar, screaming to the heavens of madness with a great moan. Drizzling showers of failure and hate fill the trenches of sorrow and defeat. The quivering trees that never speak, sit in silence while they watch you twitch. They watch in the shadows while they say no more, for you to sit on the river of your own remorse.

20090306185154AAb2yd3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story so far?	Ok im gonna start writing a story right now.   Let me think of an idea.   I see a bunch of stories wrote on websites. Can you tell me if my are any better. Im 13 years old a male. Let me take like two minutes to think of a book.      ok i have one but i dont think it is very good.      Ok here ity goes      The elavator beeped and opened with the sliding metallic doors. John Hashing looked up at the red numeric digit above the doors. "1". He looked down at his black leather briefcase. His wife had bought it for him as a christmas present. He enjoyed it and used it all the time. It had a number code so no theif could not access it. He looked around before he stepped into the elavator. He was on the first floor, which held the jewlery store in which many nervous husbands sped to to buy there wife a late anniversery gift. The floor was clean white tile with small gray spots which added to the texture of it. He spotted a woman who was in her mid 20's. She had on a short gray cotton skirt that fit very nice on her slick, curvy body. Her hair was chesnut red and it was curled and long. It rested upon her yellow turtleneck. She glanced at him and he smiled. She didnt even give a wince and turned away to help a customer. He didnt know what was wrong. He was thirty years old. He had a slim face and a nice round chin. He was not overwieght for his age, and usally went to the gym everyday. He looked very successful with his black pinstripe sport coat and his gray cotton pants. His hair was slightly blond in the front and tipped his naturally black hair. He brushed away the thought of the girl. He stepped into the brown elavator. It had an ad for Macys that had a vulgur picture drawn on it for someones amusment. The elavator had a stainless steel metal rod to hold onto, and John leaned on it, putting his briefcase in his wrist and cupping his wrist with his hand. Mr. Hashing worked as a manager for the Riser Hilltop Mall. His destination, the 12 floor to speak to his boss about a new proposal. In the elavator with him, there stood four other individuals. The one who stood closest to him was a badly injured homeless man. His arm was crippled and his face had many bruises on his unshaven dark, weepy face. His eyes were a dark abyss, showing no emotion but pure blankness. He reaked in an odor that carried along with it the smell of piss, feces, and the scent of a man who hasnt showered in a month. The other people in the elavator was an old man with his wife. They held each others hands and were cramped over. They both wore identical green knitted sweaters. The man had a recceding hair line and his face looked as if a washed up beach, wih so much erosion you could barely make out the kind of sand underneath it. The woman wore librarian glasses and had chapped lips. The fourth and not the least important was a man who had a mist about him. He was half blad, had a anxious face that was slimmer than Hashings' and had on a tan checkered sports coat. He held with him a smaller briefcase and kept looking at his watch, as if something was going to happen that would be diasterous and would affect all the occupants fate.

20090306171245AAljQZ1	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	What's the best shutter speed? Please help!?	I have a Nikon D90, and the shutter speed ranges from 1- 4000.      I don't know what the best shutter speed is for photographing STILL objects like flowers or posed people.    I know that I would need a fast shutter speed for moving objects. But what about still ones?       I also have a tripod, but don't use it much, if saying that makes a difference.      But mainly when I take still pictures, like nature, I really don't see a big difference in the picture quality on a shutter speed of 400 and a shutter speed of 4000.       Anyone know which shutter speed is the best?
20090306165954AABs2jg	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How is this poem I wrote? critisize please?	Hi there. I am having a tuff time deciding on poems to turn in for my Creative writing class.   What are your thoughts/feelings/harshness on this one?   thanks!      The Enchantment of the Night      Have you ever walked in the midst of the dark?   Do you know the enchantment of this different world?      The bright summer stars,   Wink at me,   Almost as though they are flirting with me,      I look up to them,   As a nightingale sings sweetly to its lover,      The bright, glowing moon, illuminates the earth below,      I look around in the garden and see,   Deep, plump grapes, just as purple as can be      Green ivory reaches up to what now is gone,   Decorating my palace elegantly and whole,      The aroma is peaceful and full,   As the dew perches on the sweet roses tips,      The lake sparkles like the stars up above,   Creating none other than a mid night dream      The fields rise and fall,   As the wind gently flows over its long, mangled mane,      The tree branches sway,   As they rock softly to and fro,      Yes, welcome to the Enchantment of the night.

20090306184540AAqmTSY	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Did anyone else hear about the Pleiadians?	Yeah so I've always been interested in aliens and outerspace and looked into what "starseeds" were and all but it seems I keep finding the same information repeatedly on every site I see. There's the reptilians, alien greys, and always the pleiadians, sirians, arcturians and such. And also the Galactic Federation always comes up. Now I'm a pretty open-minded individual and am not one to brush off a strange concept that seems to our primitive brains highly unlikely for that sole reason. So I wonder if there is any underlying truth in this since much of it makes sense to me. I'm not saying I believe it I'm just taking these things into consideration as I do with all things presented to me. So what are your ideas on all of this? If you don't agree there is no reason to say it in a rude way, you can just say you disagree and explain why you feel that way. I respect all opinions so feel free to say what you believe.

Ok, so when I was younger I read this one book that I'm in love with and I can't remember the name of it for the life of me.  I can give a few minor details: all I remember about it is the girl character in the book goes back to the 1890's America and meets this rich boy and falls in love with him.  He's a complete old-fashioned gentleman and she never wants to leave.  I could be mistaken but I thought the word "time" was in the title.  I'm pretty sure there's 3 books in this series.

20090306182132AAshlWz	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I'm making yet ANOTHER attempt to write a novel, how does this plot sound to you so far? (10 points!!!!???)?	Ok. Well, I was thinking that their are these 2 girls and 2 boys. The two guys (a 14 year old boy and his brother), who are basically the main characters, are suspecting that their neihboor is a murderer. They haven't seen her son (who is - or was - 4 years old) in months, so they are suspecting as well that she, well, killed him. They saw her haul a body out to the trunk of her car and their afraid to live their. Although, no one believes them and she threatends to kill them. She sets the neihboor's house on fire (since she is a nut job, no offense to her, ha ha), and the love of (the fourteen year old boy) his life lives there, so he risks his life to save her. All of her family besides her sister (the boys best friend) is in the hospital so the girl he likes lives with them, and so does his best friend (the girl likes him) and it's like a love triangle.   I kind of hate the idea, ha ha. There are honestly alot of plot holes, I know.   1.) I need ideas. I honestly just thought of the fire thing - I probably won't use it. I need ideas to fill in the plot so it's more - think, Dracula, and not Gossip Girl. Not saying theres anything supernatural about it so far - but, there could be.   2.) Do you like it????   3.) I need names.   4.) Title????

20090306175748AA420d5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you know the name of this book?	It took place in California, and it was a love story.  I don't remember the names but the girl was unpopular, although her younger sister was.  They were in high school together.  The girl's family owned a vineyard (i think it was) and they had a vegetable stand, but they were barely getting by because their dad had just died and the girl had to work at the vegetable stand a lot.  They were longtime enemies with this other family who was rich and also owned a vineyard.  I can't remember why they hated each other but they did.  It turned out the guy working for the girl's family was secretly working for the other family too, so she hated them even more.  she learned to just hate this family.  they owned the big high school and she sat by herself at lunch outside and ate an apple (i remember that!).  then, this guy sat down by her one day and he was drawing.  i think he drew her eventually.  they fell in love.  well, it turns out that her true love was partof the family her family hated, and eventually she discovered this when she came to their house.  There were three guys she named the Bookends that would always harrass her and finally after hearing her true last name (she'd been using a fake one to lie to the guy she loved) they blackmailed her into doing their essays in exchange for them not telling the guy her real identity.  she plagiarized an essay so they would get in trouble.  eventually at a party the guy who worked for her family (he got fired because the girl knew he was sneaking around behind their backs; he was going to give their crops plant poison) told everyone her real name and the guy she loved stomped out of there angry as heck.  i think it said his mom looked at her like a kicked dog and i think he had a white Jeep.  Well i dont remember how they got back together, but she talked a lot about breaking the barrier of hate or something.  Please if you've read this book tell me the name!  I'd love to read it again, I loved it!

Cut until the pain's gone/ I think I've gone insane/ No one ever loved me/ Am I the one to blame?      I dont know what to do/ Where did i go wrong?/ I can't take it anymore/ It's already been too long.      Blood is everywhere/ I curl up into a ball/ My life has been a nightmare/ I want to get rid of it all.      My dreams have turned to ashes/ I'll never smile again/ How come you didnt want me?/ Did you want my life to end?      I know I'm getting weaker/ It's hard for me to breathe/ My vision's getting blurry/ I dont want to see.      My last breath is approaching/ I wont even say goodbye/ A single tear mixes with my blood/ Alone all my life, I die.      You walk into the room/ I'm laying broken on the ground/ "I LOVE YOU" is spelled out in blood/ You can feel sorrow now

That Girl      Who is that girl…                                       That keeps her head high,   And acts like nothing’s wrong.   But her inside is aching,   And her heart is no longer strong.       Who is that girl…   That gives her brightest smile,   Laughing at every trace.   But will this flower bloom…   When she’s hiding the frown upon her face?      Who is that girl…   Whose heart is sinking deep.   She feels weak and insecure.    No one is around.   No one can save her.       Who is that girl?   That’s dying inside.   And thinks she’s out of place.   Everything’s towering over her,   There isn’t any space.      Who is she?         That girl,   Is me.    **************************************...   My Reflection      I look at the mirror.   And what do I see?   Limp hair, pale skin.   Not the girl I want to be.       I stroll toward school.    Kicking rocks along the way.   How can I change?   Or should I stay who I am today?       I walk back home.   And let out a tired sigh.     The tears sting my cheeks.     But no one hears me cry.      I spot my reflection in a puddle.   I look down, still insecure.    Twinkling eyes, bright smile.    I want to be her.   **************************************...   The Things You Do       When you hug me,    I love your warm touch,   When you smile,   My heart beats so much.       When I hear your laugh,   My mouth tingles with bliss.    When you touch my cheek,   I crave your kiss.       When you wipe my tear,   I feel strong.    When you smooth my hair.   My worries are gone.        But it’s all in my head.   Your love isn’t true.     Realize I’m dying inside.     I need you.    **************************************...   Tomorrow       It’s raining right now.   The water is dropping on the glass.    The day is finally over.    At last.      I feel weak.    I feel like everything’s a lie.    Please realize how much you‘re hurting me.   And open your eyes.       I don’t get why this happened.    Why did everything go wrong?    But tomorrow’s a brighter day.   I just have to stay strong.       The suns blaring through my windows.   As I sit up, half asleep.    Today’s a new start.    But I’m still sinking deep.       I thought everything would be better.   But why do I feel so insecure?   I can’t stop hating myself.    I want to be like her.       But tomorrow’s a new start.   A brighter day.    So, I need to get out of bed.    And ignore the doubts that come my way.    **************************************...   What happened?      We were as tight as a knot.     We were always together.    You made me smile when I didn’t want to.   And promised we’d be friends forever.           But what happened?      You’re different now.    I no longer matter.     Our friendship hit the floor.    And shattered.        Tell me that you still care.   Reassure me that I haven’t been replaced.    Smile by my side, and laugh with me.    And wipe that stuck-up smile off of your face.       Pretty soon I gave up.   Got sick of your abuse.    I turned my back on you, like you did to me.    But I’m still left with a throbbing bruise.      I’ll try to find true friends.   And you’ll fade like all the weak minded do.    I’ll forget the pain you caused me.    Just a mere memory of the morning dew.

20090306192112AAZJ1u6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good intro to a book I'm writing?	I know it's definitely not perfect cus i wrote it in like two seconds but tell me what you think.   Constructive criticism would be appreciated :)         “I heard this school is supposed to have the best soccer team in the city,” My father said awkwardly, “You like soccer, right?”    “No,” I mumbled. I had been living with my father for three years now and he knew absolutely nothing about me. I was nine when my parents got divorced. I was never close to my father so, naturally, I lived with my mom. Four years later my mother killed herself. No suicide note, no warnings, no goodbyes. I was angry at first. Betrayed that she would leave me by myself. She was the strings holding me to the ground, the very air I breathed. She was my world, and without her I was nothing. I moved in with my father immediately after her death. When I got there, I was stone: Broken inside but cold on the surface. Still, time moved on, and I had no choice but to move with it.     My father didn’t care. He didn’t care that my mother died, he didn’t care that his business was going down the tubes, and he definitely didn’t care about me. So, he followed a beautiful blonde with lip injections to Los Angeles, California and got married. She was nice enough, I suppose. She didn’t pay much attention to me and followed my father around like a puppy dog, which was fine with me. My father enrolled me in the closest public high school to our apartment.    “There it is,” My father said as we drove by a big yellow building with a big sign saying, “Welcome to Sunshine High School.”     “That is where I’m going to school?” I gaped.    “I think it’s charming!” he said.    I closed my eyes and sank deeper into my seat. This is going to be fun I thought.

It's about a girl who moves to a new house with her parents (I remember she has a really weird nickname for her mom, but that's a little irrelevant). It's an old house. She finds this dollhouse in an attic or something, and when she looks through the windows of the dollhouse, she can see things- like people and scenes from the past. She becomes totally obsessed with it.      I remember near the middle/end it got a little disturbing and creepy with the things she saw, maybe it was abuse or something. I stopped reading.      Now, any help with the name of this book? =D   All answers appreciated!

20090306202539AAWU67l	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Favorite and least favorite fictional character?	A random fun little question because I am bored but refuse to go to bed.      So, who would be your favorite fictional character, and least favorite?   And please, if you -must- say Edward, give a better reason than because he is "hot." x_x      My Favorite: Would have to be Lestat from the Vampire Chronicles. Such an annoyingly wonderful character and vampire! Called the Brat Prince for a reason. His struggles over the morality of being a vampire through out the series, and his vain bratty, yet humorous behavior through the chronicles has made me fall head over heels with his character.      Least: I realllyyy find Bella to be an annoyingly pointless character, but I dislike many different characters, usually the one who ruins the life of a character I adore. My most recent would be Richard from The Favored Child from Phillipa Gregory. You would have to read the book to find out why. He just makes my blood boil, that little tard.

20090306202211AAnPA7q	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Everyone always tells me i should publish some of my poetry what do you think?	Falling Stars      If you think you’re down on your luck and have fallen oh so far,   Then I suggest you watch for you own falling star,   Because every so often one will fall,   So you can smile and stand tall,   The universe is endless but has every star known to man kind,   And every other one that exist in every other mind,   But every day one will fall to sacrifice the most precious gift of all,   Its existence will cease but nonetheless it was created to fall,   To make you feel blessed that you have seen something so rare,    That it shed’s joy to let you know that something doses care,   But what will happen when every last star has fallen?   Will everyone just ignore they’re sorrow and burry them deep within?   Or will the universe just suddenly end?   Because it too can only go so far before it cannot bend,   Or will everything and everyone be reincarnated?   Because nothing and nobody is meant to be obliterated,   But then on the rare occasion one will enter our world and land,   Is this because it had a mission to shine for everyone’s sorrow in an    attempt to lend a hand?   Or is it trying to tell us that is it the last to fall?   Because every time you look up at the stars you are looking thousands of years   in the past; so it is possible that there are no more stars at all?   And so because it had to fall for another it leaves its light to shine,   Just to let you know everything is going to be fine,   So for now I think everyone should just look for a falling star and    appreciate its graces,   Because with so many stars that exist there is no end to the amount of    these nameless faces.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...         ~ The crazy girl that lives in my house ~      You can hear her cry,   But everyone just gave up,   They say she will until she will die,   Last time I tried to give her help,    She slammed the door in my face and said go die,      She screamed there is no hope,   She says no one cares,   And she refuses to cope,    She even admits no one cares,   I guess I am her best hope,      So I went to visit her today,    Could I help; I wanted to see,   So I turned to the mirror so I could say,   Remember me?
20090306214622AANMVxN	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this poem good, or bad?	In the twilight I see your face, so soft , so calm, your eyes sparkling in the moonlight.  As we held hands and walked home, I couldn’t stop thinking about how I felt about you.  I knew what you were thinking, but I didn’t want to believe it.  He took me home, stood at my front porch, stared me in the eyes and said”, there isn’t a day that I don’t think of you, but its just not going to work out.”  I stood there in fear, couldn’t believe this happened.  My eye’s started to tear up, he told me not to worry there is someone out there for me that’s better than anyone.  I couldn’t hold back any tears, I couldn’t take it.  As I watched  you walk away.  I ran after you.  He got in his car and drove off.  Chancing him for miles.  I couldn’t catch up.  Finally I collapsed on the road. Sobbing.  Thinking of what I did wrong.  Thinking what I did to disserve this.  I never wanted this to happen. . I got up, ran back to my house, took every picture of you and me, tarred it up.  Once again I began to cry.  The last memory of you and me was at our first date.  He took me to the movies, that was the first night that he kissed me.  But its all over now, all I have are these memories of you and I.  as I looked at the last pictured that was still whole.  I stopped crying. . .          i'm not a good writer but i really tryed hard on this..so is it good or bad?
20090306215819AA3PaF0	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Just a random poem i wrote, think its good?	it needs reviseing its only the first draft      the day we met i will never forget...the time we shared, will always be there just wish you'd believe me....nothing i would do to hurt you, but you chose it that way, so I'll never forget the day we met you'll always be in my mind. The day in the sandbox, you threw sand at my face.  We laughed at each other and became friends  ever since that day. Though all the cry’s and the days that we just want to die, Kiari was always there to make sure everything would go all right. She’s the one friend that you could never forget .  She wouldn’t leave you to watch you suffer when something goes wrong, she’d stay and help till every thing was sorted out.  Leave it to her for a best friend that I could ever ask for.  The days I’m sick or when I break a bone, she will always help me get though all of that.  We’d push each other on the swings, laugh and cry about the best times that we’ve had together.  All the great memories that would make us cry is knowing that we’ll be best friends for life and no one could change that.  Wishing that she’d take me back as a best friend.  Wondering why she hates me so much.  Ever since the day you threw sand at my face, has changed the way we’ve been friends.  We’d go to movies together and stare at the cute guys that walked by, have sleepovers and talked about guys.  One thing I can’t ever forget is that we will be friends though the ruff times and the sad times.  We swore on our friendship we would be friends forever, but why aren’t you saying that now when I’m dieing of sadness. I miss you  as my best friend.

20090306212006AAzTrbH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can someone review this evaluation for me?	yep,this is a project and i would appreciate it if you could comment this:      My First Year in High School   By Rona Kriszelle Jauculan      I spent most of the summer after I graduated elementary fretting about high school. March. April. May.  And finally June.      June 10 was the start of my high school life. Meaning, as each day passes, I have to work harder for my own future. As I spent my secondary education in a new school, I wondered about the possible things that could happen. First, I could think positive about things. Or, second, I could go running back to my grade school. I went with the first idea.      As my mom drove me to school, lots of emotions passed me. First I was excited because I’m in a new school, it’s the first day of high school, and other things that make a kid excited about their first day of school. Then I was sad, afraid because I don’t know if I would fit in. So as my mother drove me to school, I pretended to be sick, which I realized months later was a silly thing to do. I asked her if she could come with me until I was in my classroom. She told me I was acting like a baby and that my brother was also going to be late. So I had to be persuasive. I had to think of a way to make her come with me. So I thought and thought. As we reached the gate of DMC I saw a girl (I guessed that she was a first year just like me) get off her ride with her dad (and later I figured out that she was my first friend in a new school). I didn’t get out of our car, so my mom drove me in. She finally decided to accompany me until I was on the second floor. That’s where she saw some freshmen and squeezed me into the group of three. That little group, as I found out later, was as I remembered composed of Jean, Kim and another girl which I forgot who.      I was the shy type of girl(as my mother always pointed it out). So I was lucky to have made friends in my first day. But I wasn’t the one to make the first move. The girl I saw at the gate was, and will always be Meg. “hi, I’m Meg.” she said while holding her hand up for me to shake it. I took her hand shyly and shook it saying, “my name’s Rona”. And to be honest my voice was a little shaky. I probably owe it to Meg that I made friends without any difficulty at all.       First thing students do every Monday morning is attend the flag raising ceremony and to sing the national anthem followed by the school’s alma mater song. That’s the time I spent taking in details of the school. Looking at the surroundings and the first that caught my eye was the library. Then I saw the Japanese garden. During the singing of the alma mater song, I listened carefully to the words that came out of the sophomores’, juniors’ and seniors’ mouths so that I could familiarize them.      *** *** *** *** ***   I knew what the topic would be for today: getting to know each other. This meant that I would have to introduce myself to the class several times today. And wouldn’t you know it my guess was right! I felt really silly. We were told by our new teacher to find a partner and share stuff about ourselves. Luckily I already had a partner,Meg.Basic stuff like: “what’s your name?”; “where did you go to school?”; “are you an honor student?”. And so on, and so forth. Then we came up in front of the class to formally introduce ourselves. After I introduced myself, I felt my face burning. That happened every time. In the afternoon, the final sectioning of students was posted on the bulletin board. I already made friends with Meg,Nekka and Christine M. I was going to be in section Blessed Martyrs of Almeria, while Meg,Nekka and Christine were going to be in section Blessed Martyrs of Valencia. I was in a little panic because I would have to start all over again.

So here I am trying to emulate this deity and I realized; I have no idea if I can ever care less than him. What do you think?

As my mind peers over the edge, debating   On whether or not to step off the building of insanity   Into the pool of release and numbness   I engage in the thoughts of what brought me to this last step   The fighting, endless inner battles with the monster within   The stained body that carries my soul around day by day   Thee memory that seems to be jammed on repeat   And the isolation and confusion that suffocate the little life I have left   Thinking of what I have left is the least of my worries   When I look at what was important to me before, it seems   Childish.   Tired of thinking my foot steps over the age letting my body fall,fall,fall

20090306214611AArgL5i	Arts & Humanities;History	What do you think lead Rome to decline?	Political weakness, social change, weakened navy, economic decline, etc.         I personally think the weak military couldn't really support Rome after it started to diminish.  Especially with the invaders coming in through every crack into the empire, and they couldn't conquer anything with such a weak military.
20090306200521AAP6nyj	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	My poem, what do you think?	Adore?      Warmth onto you, love's transcendent lover,   from heavens grasp you fell, into our world of impurity.      From grace you were created, shrouded whole in light,   a figure free of imperfection, a perfect melodious night.   The adore of your heart, as innocent as it gets,   hold on to your beauty, for from selfishness seeds discontent.         Feed onto thee, my fantasy's manifestation,   born of ravenous lust and fragmented confrontation,   shred from humility, covered from the light,   lay waste forever to the sky's cruel feat of unending fright      From ruby to red,   from the day to the night,

20090306204459AAJGvL2	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How do you like this poem? What should I call it?	The words should come naturally,   Flowing from my fingers    And spreading on the page,    And as hard as I try, all I can hear,   Instead of beautiful lyrics in my mind,   Is the sound of someone's squeaking chair,   The rustling papers,   And people walking by.      I guess the truth is,   I'm just not a poet,   For while I should be focused   On my rhythm and meter,   I find that of all these things I can think about,   I am just asphyxiated on   My dull, dreary classroom surroundings.

I'm glad i'm not an old man   but rather just a boy   because hemorrhoids and   cataracts don't seem to be a joy      i like my skin tight   not wrinkled like a sheet   plus, they wear Velcro shoes   and fungus on their feet      old men have no jobs   they live for yesterday   and when the lecture you   they know exactly what to say      they do whatever they want   they don't need permission   they can wake up on monday   to go read books, while fishin'      all old men tell stories   that are sure to draw a crowd   they can make a whole room cry   and tell tales that make you proud      they have accomplished all their goals   or at least made an attempt   they can look back on their life   with no feeling of contempt      on second thought i wouldn't mind   if life was just a toy   but that is just for old men   and i am still a boy.

20090306215651AAu4ZGy	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this sound like an ok story so far? (spelling may be off and punctuation, it isn't final though)?	This is the sixth night I've moped around.  In two hours time it'll be the seventh day.  My hands are clammy with the tears they've gathered while cupped over my face and also with the cold sweat of       disbelief, and nervousness.  I gather what energy I have and unsteadily make my way from the edge of the bed to the bulb-lit vanity.  I plop down on the very girly stool I made to reflect who I am...or was,       96 hours ago.  I glance from the carpeted floor to the clean mirror straight in front of me.  The person looking back has no expression, or maybe that's what it seems like when that person is so frozen with       anguish and fear.  My fair, youthful skin has become so achy from this hair gripping ordeal,it seems.  My newly dull, brown hair maintains most of its curls although they look somewhat un-tamed.  My lips are       chapped from these moisture suckers called tears; the which of whom have been my only company these past few days.  Those blue eyes of mine and brag-worthy eyelashes seem washed-out.  Oh that color.  WHY       THAT COLOR?!  My eyes can't be blue.  "They're not allowed to be!!" I scream up at God, "This is the color of her eyes. Her 9 year old, innocent, playful eyes, damn it!"    I find myself shaking with anger.  It was his plan wasn't it?  God's plan to have her stolen from the front yard that afternoon.      Great isn't it?  A mother leaves the her to go make lemon-aid for her thirsty daughter and she, with the tray, comes back only to the sight of her missing.  I can't tell you how fast that colorful,       drink holding tray fell to the concrete.  The sound of metal on stone is enough to send shivers up your spine, as if I didn't have enough at that moment as it was.      Her toys, her brush; everything but *her* was there! I panicked and yelled out her name.  "Maybell...MAAAYBELLLL?!!"  When no response made its way into my ears, I ran into the house, fumbling to       push the right numbers on the kitchen's wall phone.  I managed to dial 911 between extreme shakes of fear and listened as it rang.  After what seemed like too long, a dispatcher picked up.    "911, what's your emergency?"    "My daughter," i say while exhaling, ever more panicked, "she, she's missing!!!"

20090227090617AA4n1Ot	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What is a good tone for this poem?	I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,   All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,   Without any companion it stood there uttering joyous leaves of dark green,   And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,   But I wondered how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there   without its friend near, for I knew I could not,   And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it,   and twined around it a little moss,   And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,   It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,   (For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)   Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;   For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana   solitary in a wide flat space,   Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend or lover near,   I know very well I could not.

20090227101037AAWDP55	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this sound like a good story?	okay, i am attempting to write a story for fun, and was wondering if the plot sounded good.  The main character is a 18 year old girl who wakes up and doesn't remember who she is.  In the world that she lives  in (its in america but a little in the future, maybe like 2128, i don't know yet) and there is this company that you can go to to start your life over basically.  They will erase your past, so you can have a better life.  Not many people have this done, its hard to get and it very new.  So when the girl wakes up, she doesn't know that she had this done, and she try's to figure out what happened to her.  She realizes later what happened, and try's to tell people to not have this done.  The company finds out about her doing this, and try's to make her stop, and try's to have her killed.  She finds other people that have had this done to, and works with them.        What could I add to the story and take out?   Any Suggestions?   What should I name my characters?   Thanks

20090227092706AAc4ZwR	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Will someone tell me what you think of half of a chapter in my book?	Please read this half to the first chapter in my book and give me some feedback. Were you interested in the story? How is the dialoge? Did I use too many words? etc.      Chapter 1       The morning I became a middle schooler was one of the best yet worst days of my entire life. It was a bright autumn morning, full of promises of a cold winter. I had thrown on my favorite “fuzzy” sweater from Hollister, and my mom had stuffed a few of her delicious cookies into my lunch box. Both of those things made me feel loved and warm, happy and excited. “If you make it through the day,” My mother had said as I made my way out of the house. “I'll make a pumpkin pie and buy a can of whipped cream for us to eat after dinner tonight.” I licked my lips. Whipped cream was my favorite.    Yet I'm sure nothing, not even whipped cream and pumpkin pie, could have be rid of the cold feeling in my gut as I waited for the first period bell to ring, standing in the hall. I glanced at every person who passed me, and a few who didn't, looking for anyone I knew. Maybe that would help my turning stomach. Soon I found a face I recognized; Tasmine Moon Victoria Deserae Anderson stood at her locker.    I nearly leaped for joy. Although I didn't have any good friends, Tazmine, also known as “Moon”, was the one person I wanted to talk to. But I was too shy to walk up and say anything. What if she thinks I'm weird, or what if she doesn't remember me? I thought. I opened my locker, deliberately making some noise with the hopes that she would notice me. It didn't work. Desperate, I dropped a crayon box full of pencils, and the lid popped open when it hit the floor. Dozens of bright new pencils rolled across the tile floor towards her. She looked up just long enough to see my face.    “Mia Marie!” She said as she trotted towards me. Her black hair bounced off her shoulders.    “Moon! It's great to see you.” I replied, bending over to retrieve the pencils.    “You're the first familiar face I've seen all day. Everyone else I knew has vanished.” She crouched as she scooped up more pencils and her face wrinkled in a frown. “I hate being a pixie.”    We stood and after putting the crayon box and all but one pencil up, I stood and continued scanning faces.    “'Pixie'?” I asked, chewing on the eraser of the pencil.    “Yeah, a 6th grader.” Agitation showed up in her voice. “Where have you been all summer? Haven't you read the middle school dictionary?”     I shook my head.    “The best if you want to know all of the slang and street language.” She said, clicking her tongue. “So, what have you done this summer?”    I frowned as a little thorn of painful memory ripped my heart open. The eraser left my mouth.    “Uh, well, I've been bouncing back and forth between here and my dad's house. No time for books.”    Understanding dawned onto her face as I flung the pencil into my locker, wishing that all of the painful memories would just fly away with it.     “Oh.” She said, all enthusiasm drained from her voice.    My father and mother had been divorced last spring, right before summer break, and I ended up being shuffled from one house to the other all summer until my mother received custody of me.    “Besides, I don't like slang.” I replied, slamming my locker shut.    “Well wait until you hear this rumor I've heard creeping around the school.” Something interesting danced in her eyes as I leaned closer. It was as if we were about to share a deep secret.    “Do you happen to remember a girl by the name of Tammy from the elementary school?” She asked in a whisper. “Had long, blond hair. Stood at only 52'' I suppose. Spent more time in the office than in the classroom. Really energetic. Supposedly she's an only child of a rich couple. The envy of every girl.”    I shook my head.    Moon smiled. “She's still in town and supposedly she's already the most popular kid in the school. And wait, there's more. If I've heard correctly, she's looking for you.”     My jaw must have dropped, because Moon smiled. “Just wait, you'll see her sooner or later. You can't miss her with the crowd that follows her around. And her voice. You'll never get by that.”    The bell rang. And as quickly as Moon had come in sight, she was gone.       For the rest of the day I thought about this girl who had so quickly won the affections and admiration of the students in the middle school. I had always said that I would rather have a few great friends than be the most popular girl in school. But I wasn't sure if I felt sorry for Tammy or if I was jealous.     After lunch the next day all of my questions were answered. I was walking down the long hallway towards my next class with a few books in hand, students buzzing all around me. As I gazed up at the posters hanging on the walls someone bumped into me. Or may I say, I bumped into them. And my books fell with a thud to the floor, spilling all of my homework sheets.     I'm not sure if there was sweat or smoke coming out of my ears. I was mad, yes, because I had sp
