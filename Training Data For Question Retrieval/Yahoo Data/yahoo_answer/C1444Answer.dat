XkSEtcPHaa	I've been tested through school twice. The first time was in the 2nd grade where I got a score of 132. The second time was my junior year of high school cause I moved a few states away. I scored 133.|`|ErN3pbTeaa	100    and LOL! I wish it were only 1%(Homophobes). It seems more like 80%|`|AyEkA6Flaa	I'm 138.    I'll bet this forum averages well above 100.    Since I was homophobic myself for many years, I can't say the average homophobe is only an IQ of 20.  It is an emotional thing, not a defect in the intellect.  If anything, their brains do wonderful intellectual gymnastics to avoid the obvious truth.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Well, if you have less IQ than 20 then you're just a drain on resources in this world. I would say the average IQ is about 80 to 90.|`|lEignX9Vaa	The average IQ of a human is 100. They did that on purpose.    I would say intolerant people have lower IQs in general, they are unable to empathize or see the world beyond themselves. Intolerance is definitely an intellectual impediment. But thats an average, I'm sure there are intelligent arseholes too.    Since most people in this section or openminded and are capable of basic logic, and are intellectually curious enough to want to discuss issues, I would say its probably in the 115 area. You have to factor in the idiots who just want to post stupid crap for attention.    I took some IQ tests (Took a couple in school, the rest online), I scored in the 135-140 area, but I think they are fixed so you get a higher result. So nobody feels bad. But I'm aware I have above-average intelligence. :D|`|xsZfN0JHaa	It's not IQ, but that people have a right to their opinions. My IQ is around 140 or more and I am not homophobic.

Mine range between 150-164, but the most scrutinizing and professional one found me at 160.     Also, I truly believe that scoring high does not attribute to anything but being able to process information and solve problems quicker than some. To get to the top of a field you need to work. The term "genius" is dehumanizing and creates an elitist society. No matter what your IQ is we all make similar mistakes, procrastinate and sometimes fail.|`|HHRrlqhwaa	Based on the book "Microtrends" (www.microtrending.com) the highest emerging IQ's come from what the book calls "late breaking gays" or men that have established their family life's and decided to (or got caught) come out of the closet, and they clock in at the 138 range. Me personally, at the late 130's early 140's range, missed the late breaking part, and came out at 20. If I would have waited, I would have gained a few IQ points, lol.|`|H5CdsnByaa	My IQ is 148.

0rpN2419aa	We bought a cane, and tied a basket to it.  In the basket you can put funny things that go along with aging.  Denture adhesive, Milk of Magnesia, High fiber cereal...go to the store and you will find some fun things to put in the basket, a whistle or a bell etc.  Opening this gift first is a great ice breaker as everyone cracks up, but only do this if the receiver has a good sense of humor, also if person has a good humor, buy some black helium balloons, a crepe paper streamers and some pretty "50" helium balloons to add color.  Start out with the healthy foods that older people eat just for fun, then party on with the normal foods people like at birthdays.  We just had so much fun with it!  I know you will get lots of good ideas on here and if you combine them, will find the answer you need.  The cane though, filled basket, was just the greatest ice breaker.|`|NkZNV9ROaa	Maybe you could have the party on the other side of a hill ("over the hill").  Isn't 50 supposed to be silver?  If so, then I'd say keep the decorations silver, and if he has a favorite color, most saturated colors look good with silver.  How about a hill-shaped cake, with candles on one side, or a cane-shaped cake, or even a denture-shaped one?  Gag gifts along similar veins are always fun too.  Or maybe you could kick the stereotype, and have it be a cool, younger-style party if that matches his personality more, such as a pool party or something if you live in warmer climates like I do.  If just the opposite, maybe a skiing trip would be fun.  I'm sure you could think of an 'over the hill' joke for that case.  In any case, a custom cake is always sure to be a hit, from what I've seen.|`|YqpI0aX1aa	you can try look at this website..

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

But isn't this just defining people according to preconceptions?    And isn't it just as demeaning to preconcieve all lesbians as "butch?"

It is a fascinating insight & revelation.|`|31e3e41e921ac26f4d4f04e1526526d4aa	I haven't heard, but it's one more data point to support the idea that sufficiently vague prophecies will continuously be interpreted and re-interpreted as being deeply meaningful (and coincidentally relevant) to our lives.|`|i46hr7duaa	"I'm convinced."

9vOBtO1Oaa	The TRUTH you already question -  you already intuit. No, Chaos, there are no aliens or demons...only people who have forfeited their humanity, and their humaneness because they KNOW deeply within, they are incompetent to EVER be anything more than what pathetically they are now. So they issue forth obstacles to make you wonder what forces (alien) there could be, away from them, who are creating the harm and the overwhelming chaos which causes convenient, temporary blindness to those who see clearly!  I believe you are a person with the grace (favour) of natural intuition, use it to HELP correct our human situation, AND condition, so often weak and vulnerable to people who look and behave as people, but are more; frustrated mutations or have turned or are turning into monsters. Every little drop into the bucket of helping the good in us, the good among us counts!!!  Make your contribution!  I know I make mine EVEN under siege!  Become one of the few messengers of the TRUTH you say you seek!  I encourage you!!! Please!!!!!    I am glad you have been wise to NOT mention any names, for you would be attacked instantly and from the COWARDLY cover of anonymity...thusly, remain wise when expressing yourself, understand??? (I believe you do!!!) Good Luck!

Free from sin, to do the will of God.  Free to love others and do good to them.  God does not control me, he directs me.  Because of forgiveness of sin through Jesus, I am therefore free.    Freedom does not mean I can do what ever I want! Freedom ALWAYS comes with responsibility and accountability.
AA11396388	Firstly science is struggling to define the nature of reality and what it is let alone if there are any boundary's to it.  Science is also struggling with defining consciousness, what exactly is it, how does it work, where does it come from, does it cease to exist when the physical body dies.  Psychology says conscious awareness is a construct created by your brain from pre programming, genetic and cultural and how your brain processes incoming stimuli from the senses.  Of course science can only explain about 1/5th of brain function and doesn't know what the other 4/5ths are doing.      Many religious practices from Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam and Christianity encourage self denial as a way of getting to the true self.  From personal experience I know loosing the self can open you up to a greater self.  My story.  I had a physical illness that affected everything.  Consequently it affected my brain function and for a short period I lost my sense of connection with my body and my identity, my memory was all over the place and my senses fluctuated. It was frightening and terrible to experience.  However, during this time I experienced both spiritual and psychic occurances.  It's as if because my brain couldn't recognise my body and didn't seem to know where my boundries were, it went into an alternate function that took me in a sense to a higher level of conscious functioning.|`|H7L66ynJaa	This is easily solved Love the lord your god with all your heart and soul and might and your neighbour as yourself.

The noise is going to blow our heads off.  The information highway is more than a human can handle.      This is why I sit alone in a cabin dreading on my next move which will be closer to a larger city, but still in the mountains.  It is almost next to impossible to "be in the moment" when you are inundated with cell phones, car noises, machine noises everywhere.  How does one sit still and shut their mind off?   I can do this when I am asleep, taking a bath, usually I have to be alone.  wouldn't it be great to live on a farm where you could just walk around and breath in the air, look at the trees, the birds, insects and not here cars racing by.  Is this something one gets used too?  I have tried diligently not to think, but it is so hard when you have externals knocking at your door and I do mean this metaphorically.      Peace.

acaJSqW6aa	It sounds like he doesn't want any involvement.  If it is something other than your personal past with this guy you need to involve the law if it has to do with real property and getting disentangled from one another.  Let the court talk to him.  You don't give enough info about what the discussion would be about so the situation has to be assumed and the answers will be lacking.  You don't get him to talk. You don't have a relationship that allows that any more.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	A subpoena usually opens their mouth.|`|9RvOhmY1aa	The best way is to catch him when he is not interested in something else, like what's on tv or what he has to work on in the garage.  Like out to eat at a sit down restraunt when you have his full  attention.  Or for that matter even at home eating dinner.  Seems like when they are eating at the table they are more prone to listen.|`|SY5JQX69aa	just force it out of him    hit the weak spots you know    like open up to him  & he'll do the same.|`|sYyNyjwuaa	Get him when he's relaxed. Don't try and talk to him when he's stressed or just got home from work. Talk to him somewhere when he's comfortable. Be non-confrontational and make sure you talk TO him, not at him.     (I didn't know either, I just asked my husband his take on the question.)|`|0ede6ed5af86402f961daba9a691dc95aa	You don't.  If he has not done this in the past he won't do it now.  When our finances were in a state of despair I had to take the upper hand and handle things myself.  I didn't ask for his opinion or his input, I just did it.  You have the legal help, should you need advice, now take the ball and run with it.|`|smFfcmYuaa	The only way you get anybody to talk about any thing that is "important" is by first making sure that they're willing to deal with it. The reason that most people don't want to talk about this that or the other thing is because they don't want to deal with any of it. The reasons for that are diverse and not really important.    So if you ambush him when he's relaxed as other people are suggesting then all you're going to do is make him want to deal with it even less. But realistically if something has gotten bad then it's time for you to start bailing the boat out yourself as much as you can, and maybe if things improve a bit the guy will be less overwhelmed and ready to work on things.    I'm reminded of something I read about marriage counseling a while back, that unless both people have agreed to make the decision to go because they actually want to then it will in fact do more harm. You can apply that idea to any discussion, and I'm sure if you think about things up to this point you'll recognize that you were the only one who wanted to talk about things.     So just do your best and float the idea to him that you would like to talk about things sometime. As a last piece of advice if you start off by saying no rehashing or blaming then you are in fact setting the precedent for rehashing and blaming. Honestly a little of that sometimes is not bad. You have to first understand exactly where people stand and get the emotions out of the way before you can come to a mutual compromise in a logical manner.|`|LisP31O8aa	If he doesn't want to, you can't.    It still takes two to tango .|`|WauRLOovaa	You cannot get to nor make another person do anything.  You can only indicate to him that YOU would like to talk and then present him with a short list of points on your agenda and discuss them matter of factly without much blah blah nor side street additions.    If he thinks you and your topic(s) are worth his attention, then he will give it to you, within limits. If you need to 'convince' him, give him a good reason to consider you worth it, like 'i will otherwise talk to you via your lawyer' or similar wording.    Good luck.|`|c058a8802f5627063b81819d961b2c72aa	Maybe the "question" isn't that important to him and he's already said all that he's going to say about it.. and, he's tired of listening to you repeating the same stuff.  This isn't a "slam" towards you, but you did ask the question, and most of the answers I see, are from women, so I just gave you MY opinion from a man's point of view.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Asking the impossible?  Men don't talk, they fix ~ and that should be the end of it.(according to men)   Read "Men are from Mars and Woman from Venus"  and it will tell you clearly - not a snowball's hope in hell.  The only way is to nag, but so that HE does not notice you are a nag.  Peace.|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	Silver Tape!!!  NO JUST KIDDING!!!

My mom goes through the same thing with her husband...they're both 90 so I'm sure there's been some stories spun many times!!!  My man was in Vietnam and hers in WWII so when we go on a trip all together we rehash them...the war stories I listen to intently and try to imagine how they made it back!!!  As far as the question I really don't know unless you watch TV together then you can debate politics and start a fight!!LOL!!!|`|7fHsyHYraa	He might be willing to sit down and talk about things if there was an advantage or reward for him.  Schedule the meeting time and place.  Limit the talk/discussion to 30 minutes, provide a written agenda in advance, have a mediator present and promise to accept the deal that is struck.  If he sees this as a opportunity to do it and get it over with, once and for all, he might be willing to do it.    I'm assuming you are dealing with an ex-husband instead of a current spouse.  Good luck and best wishes to you!|`|AA12185428	I read the other answers first. As I suspected, you did get very good answers. If I can assume, you have a very busy household, maybe you both work, kids, etc. Hubby's down time is probably his time to "not think", plus he has probably already learned that you have better verbal skills than him and he doesn't stand a chance. He's already learned to just listen and do what he wants. You may want to consider some counseling for communication skills. That could be a lifelong asset to your relationship with him and others as well.|`|WsdFOGKMaa	The same way that you lead a horse to water .... with high hopes and not a lot more.     Speaking from experience .... I tend to pick my times!    A lengthy car journey is usually good ...... no escape for him!    I have also written letters and insisted that he sit down and read them whilst I am there. Not a great deal of progress with that one.     The latest and the one that has worked is to simply preface the session with a preamble along the lines of : LISTEN CAREFULLY because I am not going to raise my voice above this level. This information is VERY IMPORTANT - FOR YOU. What I about to say to you is a vision of the future if this attempt to communicate with you fails.     What you have to remember though is that this is a last ditch attempt and therefore you could say it is an ultimatum.   And as with all ultimatums - if you do not stick to it ... you actually lose power for evermore.     But also remember that you are going against the nature of the beast.   What you are asking him to do is pretty much the most unnatural thing that a man can do without getting arrested! Talking about anything that means anything seems to trip something in their minds.    You just have to be seen to mean that you are going to do this. And his very first decision that he has to make is whether or not he is going to participate. His second decision if he decides not to participate is where he is going to live.     Good luck lass - I think you are going to need it!    love life  and friends|`|2R3iJnFPaa	You can't make anyone listen to you.  Looks like it's time to let the lawyers handle it.  You seem very frustrated, you can always rant here.  Good luck!|`|xyt9NdjVaa	If he's not interested, you will not get him to listen to reason. You can't force him to discuss matters. You can't force anyone to listen to reason that doesn't want to, short of physically tying him to a chair to listen, and I don't suggest that at all. A lot of men can tune women out. It's an art form they have mastered. No offense to the guys, it is what it is.|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	Think of it as having a meeting - write an agenda - set rules for negotiation, that you can only discuss whats on the agenda.    Add goals that you want to achieve by meeting together.    Sit at a table, with the agenda in front of each of you - along with paper and pencil to make notes.    Also serve a nice refreshment before starting to set a calm relaxed mood.    Hope this helps.  DeeJay.|`|ffbbb387bd63bd0363e7b715ef26680caa	You did say that this man is your ex, right?  And that he refused to talk about finances when you were married?  Just a guess, but I think that unless he sees some type of financial advantage for himself in a sit-down with you, he's not going to bother.  Some men love to talk about this stuff with other men.  Is there a male financial advisor at your bank who could sit down with you both to review your financial history?  This is a free service at most banks, and he might be more willing to disclose his assets and debts if he thinks there's a chance that the advisor can help him save some money.  Good luck with this.|`|ohKKJAi4aa	You just tell him that it is important to you and important to your relationship.  But the rest is up to him.  I divorced my husband because he refused to talk to me about things, he kept discussing our business with his buddies at work. If he doesn't want to talk, maybe the relationship isn't as important to him as it is to you.|`|kYYHw7xEaa	I'm tired tonight.   Can I get back to you? I will.    Edit; thanks for your patience.  I think the discussion would force him to take another step forward. For some reason, he is reluctant. I think that's the issue that needs to be dealt with first.   As long as he's holding on to a shred of the past, then he doesn't have to change.  Could he be having second thoughts on decisions made?|`|o6MQWMo5aa	Must admit I try to avoid this, deep meaningful discussions usual reveal problems I don't want to face. I know the problems I cause but don't want to admit them. My wife has a simple method, she suggests we go somewhere I will enjoy, a garden centre perhaps, drives the scenic route, and there is no escape. This is not a frivolous answer.|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	Maybe you should take a lesson from the research I read, showing that men talk better side-by-side, not facing each other.  I put this in questions once and several men said it wasn't true.  But when I was with a man, he talked best in the car, or walking side-by-side in the woods, on a trail hike.  Thing here for you would be to get him in the car and drive yourself, ending at some place where you're at a counter somewhere, having a soda or something.  An ice cream soda.  End it with a team feel.|`|oP3VVW5raa	How  do you get a man to sit down and talk about things that are important ?    By listening to him.      Let him rant.  It will stop in a while when he notices that all you are doing is listening to him (with your mind blank and no ready questions).  Then listen some more.  Really listen.    You did ask.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Why would I care to do that?  What is in it for me?  How could you possibly know more than I?  I don't want to talk to you now. We have been down that road before.    These are all barriers to be overcome. I am not being a smart butt here iso. But these are some of the reactions to expect at first.    I know for me it would all be in the approach and slow to get going.  Once I have tuned someone out of my life it pretty much stays that way unless there is something of benefit to me.    Keep it statistical and in writing. I assimilate more information when I can read it and consider it.    I think there are some good answers on here and I hope they help.
KqiiT1WSaa	The solutiuon to the recession can be found in the final sermon of the prophet Muhammed (saw). End riba (interest). Followed correctly Islam can cure every illness    THE FINAL SERMON:    After praising, and thanking Allah the Prophet (pbuh) said :    "O People, lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether after this year, I shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and TAKE THESE WORDS TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE PRESENT HERE TODAY.    O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...    Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.    O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.    O People, listen to me in earnest, worship ALLAH, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.    All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.    Remember, one day you will appear before ALLAH and answer your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.  O People, NO PROPHET OR APOSTLE WILL COME AFTER ME AND NO NEW FAITH WILL BE BORN. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the QURAN and my example, the SUNNAH and if you follow these you will never go astray.    All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. Be my witness, O ALLAH, that I have conveyed your message to your people".    Thus the beloved Prophet completed his Final Sermon. After the sermon, near the summit of Arafat the revelation came down:    "This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My Grace upon you, and have chosen Islam for you as your religion." (Al Quran: Al-Maeda :3)|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	what the hell...the prophet practiced capitalism.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	rodizm|`|m0lxBmPqaa	I don't think so Islam of the medieva times will be the solution.. we have many conflicts in the world.. we have to solute the problem of Africa and to help them.. and to destroy hatred and another conflict with the middle east.. we need a solution for palestinians.. many things..

Usury  is charging interest on money that is loaned out.Also, God knows that approximately every 50 years there is a cycle with money. To relieve the pressure, God said that every 50 years all debts are to be forgiven and  all slaves are to be allowed their freedom if they want it.  See Leviticus in Old Testament of the Bible. Does the Koran or Hadiths suggest something similar?  If so , where? I am interested. It should.

Anything bad in this world that causes disease, war, sickness, and death is of Satan; not of God.  Actually God sent His only son to die for our sins so that one day we may all have a chance at eternal life which is far more important and great than the life here.  If anything God brings life into this world every single day. The ones who pass away have had their time no matter how long or short and will rise again one day when Christ returns.  All of these things may be written in the Bible to come to pass but can you imagine that if God is our creator than He already knew we would mess it up? That He then gave us a way to repent and make things right even if we never did in our life here on earth?   God creates far more miracles if we would just pay attention than he has death. We should not fear death as if you have faith in God, someone may take your life but they can never take your soul.|`|y9b8HGFgaa	no i don't think GOD is one of the leading causes of death in history its his creation GOD gave everything to us and what did we give back wars, polluting, global warming, and killed species etc and who ever kills for GOD, cause how would they know what GOD wants but that's my opinion|`|TrmLJB7Daa	If you do something wrong and the law punishes you ,doe sn t mean that the law or the people who punished you on the law are guilty about anything.|`|E9chZY74aa	God is the giver of life and the only one who can take it.|`|UK0HFbCyaa	God definitely killed a lot of people...I can't say about today though|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Yes.

It never bothered me until one time this man asked me if I spoke spanish and I said no as usual, then he was like "oh well then you need to learn how." He was a customer so I couldn't really say anything rude, but I thought that it was really mean. Another thing that most people don't know is that German not Spanish is the second most spoken language in the U.S.|`|EXurNsB4aa	No, it hasn't happened to me because I am white and I look white, but I sympathize with you.  There is absolutely no reason for people to be rude like that.  As long as you can communicate with your family and in your life, then it's not really up to random strangers to tell you what you should speak.  I know it goes deeper than that for some people, because language is tied to identity, but it's still a personal choice, so others should butt out.

lVSDB0Hwaa	an explosion|`|gBGuyVgUaa	Exactly same as the difference between a normal human being and a carnivorous animal.|`|AH1LuqZMaa	American media uses the term moderate Muslim to indicate a Muslim who is either pro-western in her politics or is being self-critical in her discourse.   Moderate Muslims aspire for a society  a city of virtue -- that will treat all people with dignity and respect. There will be no room for political or normative intimidation. Individuals will aspire to live an ethical life because they recognize its desirability. Communities will compete in doing good and politics will seek to encourage good and forbid evil. They believe that the internalization of the message of Islam can bring about the social transformation necessary for the establishment of the virtuous city.  The only arena in which Moderate Muslims permit excess is in idealism.       The term Fundamentalist has been extensively misused by the media to refer to terrorists who happen to be Muslim, or who are anti-American Muslims. This is not accurate. Fundamentalist Islam is simply the conservative wing of Islam, just as fundamentalist Christianity is the conservative wing of Christianity. The vast majority of Muslmi fundamentalists are pious individuals who strictly follow the teachings of Mohammed, promote regular attendance at mosques, and promote the reading of the Qur'an. Many promote the concept of theocratic government, in which Sharia (Islamic law) becomes the law of the state. Most probably view the West as secular, ungodly, decadent and obsessed with sex.
AH1LuqZMaa	Before you approach prayer you should purify yourself by performing ablution (Wudu). The first step in performing wudu is to intend it in your heart and by uttering, or saying in your mind, the words "bismillah" (in the name of Allah).    Then rinse your palms up to the wrist three times, rinse your mouth thrice, wash your nose by sniffing water in it thrice, wash your  face three times, then wash your hands up to the elbow, the right hand first  then the left hand.  Then wipe your head with wet hands, rub your ears  with wet hands and finally wash your right feet up to the ankle thrice  and repeat it with your left foot.  When washing your hands, arms and feet you should always start with your right one and repeat it three times, as the Prophet taught us to do.  After you are finished you should say ashadu an-la ilaha illallahu, washadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh.    If you go to the bathroom for any of your necesities, pass wind, sleep or become unconscious, you should purify yourself again by following the same procedure as described above before the next prayer.  If you are in a state of major impurity (discharge of semen in erotic dreams or sexual intercourse) purify your body by taking a complete bath (Ghusl).   Women should also take a bath after menstruation or child-birth.  The procedure is as follows (1)  have the intention of ghusl, (2) wash the private  parts, (3) perform ablution (wudu) as you do before prayer (4) put water  over the head (5) wash the whole body, head and hair thoroughly so as  not to leave a dry spot (6) say ashadu an-la ilaha illallahu, washadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh.  A Muslim is expected to do ghusl at least once a week is on Friday  before the congregational prayers, though nowadays it is hardly applicable as we take showers everyday.    Women are exempt from performing prayer during the days of menstruation and child-birth time.  As for other times, they are required to perform prayer  promptly.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	Face Mecca is the only one I know.|`|i6QfwNTJaa	they have to have their prayer beads, they need to cleanse themselves with water and praying during cleansing. or chanting.  they have to have a prayer mat. women have to cover themselves.    this all i remember about it.|`|IbyxsgHhaa	They wash thier hands, arms, face, and feet to clean themselves before each prayer. They make intention of praying, facing the east (towards mecca-- holy site of Islam where Abraham is believed to have built the holy site called the Kaaba). After intention is made, one prays (called "salaat") in physical prostration towards God (praising and exalting God, and thanking God). After that part of the prayer is over, one makes "dua" which is putting hands together (like people of other faiths, christians), and talking/asking God for forgiveness, or anything. The "dua" aspect of prayer can occur anytime of the day, as many times as the person wants, in any circumstance. One does not have to wash up to talk to God in that manner. That is all. Prayer as a whole is seen as a direct communication with God alone. There are no priests or confessionals in Islam. Everything is between the person, and God alone. During the process of prayer (salaat), a muslim wont turn attention to any distractions in the room until the prayer is complete.    I believe the 5 things you are talking about are the 5 pillars of Islam|`|5PAfTUfIaa	first they have to make sure they have taken a bath if they had sex(bath required only they had sex).  then they should take abolution(washing the mouth, hands,nose,leg etc)  then they should know what prayer the are going to pray  have an intension that they are going to pray for the sake of Allah alone.  and must know the verses and the basic movements in the prayer.  make sure they face the kabba  and have their clothes above the ankle  to know more contact badzayed@yahoo.com

Also respect is another important aspect in the Chinese culture especially to elders or mentors.

In rhyming backslang, you rhyme an object with the second part of a two part phrase, such as "trouble and strife = wife" or "china plate = mate." Sometimes the entire rhymed phrase is used, as in "apples and pears," and sometimes only the non-rhyming part of the phrase is used, as when someone calls a friend "old china."
EXurNsB4aa	IQ is not an accurate way to measure intelligence, so high IQ societies don't mean much in my opinion.  I don't know what exactly they do in Mensa.  I think they're involved in research and donations.|`|yegDdZfRaa	Yes they are inaccurate.    Here's my opinion.     There are 2 types of intelligence in the world.    1. You have the math/science people who are really really smart and brainy but have no common sense or social or organizational skills.    2. Then you have the artsy people who love music, history, art and are really good at grammar & spelling. They are usually very organized and more socially adept than the prior. They also suck at math/science (I fall into this category).    There are always exceptions to the rule, but in my experience, I have found the above observations to be true.    Well, that's my 2 cents. It might not be the answer you were looking for, but at least it's an answer. Good luck.|`|W1xs3vYBaa	IQ tests are an indicator of the ability to process information and think logically, but not of success in life.    You need to have a balanced life style to be happy and that can be accessed by an emotional IQ test.       To the comment above: To have a high IQ you have to have a brain that can work in both words and maths. Therefore, to be in a high-IQ society (which I think is just ridiculous and tooting ones own horn. I know many people who could be in Mensa and choose not to because they have do not believe in elitism) one must be able to utilize both 'categories'.
WUjlEuTtaa	Abortion is a reality in this world..And if it is a sin, then it should be between that woman and God...|`|E9chZY74aa	Murder of innocence is always wrong.|`|mMPjXbvcaa	*head explodes*|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Abortion is ALWAYS a sin, but aside from that, your question makes no sense.|`|i6QfwNTJaa	which sin is greater? to have a child and not care for it, let it grow up to be a murderer or drug addict, street walker, or pyschotick?  or just chose to not have it?|`|AA11796124	There are NO CIRCUMSTANCES in which abortion can be considered the morally proper alternative.|`|wG825TwBaa	The only problem I have with people saying life begins at conception is that, at conception, it is a single celled zygote consisting of human DNA. I dont understand how someone can say this single cell can be human but an ape is not related to us. After all, spit, a hair, piece of skin, etc are full of cells which contain your DNA but that does not make them human. The human fetus can not be removed from the womb until at least the 27th week and survive. Even then you would need a crackpot medical team and it still might die. The real question about abortion(for christians) is when does god place the soul into the human, if such a thing exists? and even then one can argue "who says that its the christian form of soul and not anothers". If souls do not exist than removing a human fetus, before its capable of life on its own, is comparable to removing a tumor. Neither could survive outside the body and both contain human DNA. If souls do exist, than is it the christian idea, where its a "one time shot" at knowing god, which in this case all abortion would be bad. Or is it the soul of Buddhists where many chances are given, which is comparable to a job interview. Its just a failed chance. The real question is not when does HUMAN life begin, this is certainly not at conception biologically, but do people in fact have souls. All I can say on that is good luck on finding your soul, religion.|`|8FrPKWiXaa	I don't understand the question. However,I do believe you kill a human being when you choose to have an abortion. So,yes it is a sin.|`|y9b8HGFgaa	i definitely know abortion is a sin in islam its like killing a person even though they haven't been born yet but i don't in other religions i don't know if its a sin in christanity cause some people say it is others say it isn't i guess we all have our own opinions|`|tLXD3yOWaa	according to most christians abortion is a sin because Jesus said to preserve human life and not to take another's life. i am a very christian person but i have no problem with abortion...some people choose that and it's their decision. I know that I would never be able to do it but that's just me, if you choose not to believe in it or to believe in it it should be a decision that comes to you purely from your own thoughts and beliefs not what is "right" or "wrong" in the eyes of others.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	no. the bible never mentions abortions and jesus said nothing about them either. some christians JUST LOVE to twist the bible and put words in poor jesus' mouth.
rlayqcGjaa	Alcohol is much worse than marijuana.  Marijuana use is discouraged by alcohol/drug companies because they make huge profits off of marijuana prohibition.  A drug that has a zero death rate versus the large death rate of alcohol and prescription should defiantly be legal.|`|zb7Fd0qAaa	Alcohol was illegal in the US from 1920-1933.  It took the Great Depression to make it legal again.  Marijuana was legal in the US until 1906 when laws started to be made on the federal and then state level.  Now, we are seeing several states reverse their positions and decriminalize possession of small amounts.      If you look to the law to determine what is moral, you will have a very shaky compass to follow.  Issues that are truly moral are not subject to change on a whim that way.  Follow the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Unless you are a sociopath that rule will simplify your decision making and keep you on the right path.|`|zk6VcOUtaa	I don't believe marijuana is immoral. God created the cannabis plant, and told Adam and Eve to reap the benefits of all he created, save the Tree of Knowledge. So why should it be considered immoral? Marijuana isn't immoral when used for medical purposes. When used for what some people refer to as "recreation" is just as reasonable a use. It helps tp reduce stress. It has negative side effects, yes, but what doesn't? Cigarettes and alcohol destroy the body as easily. And on another note, making marijuana legal might just pull us out of our economic crisis.|`|ncSd9jXDaa	are you high right now?? hahah that just sounds funny... the stuff you wrote lol    i have no idea.|`|B8Yzaq5waa	But look at the heavy restrictions and taxes on alcohol, and cigarettes    how would you feel about a government run, sanctioned smokehouse? would you submit to regulations that gave you a cooldown period from weed after it was effecting you?    most of my friends that smoke would say no and do it at home anyways.|`|d9cB8yN8aa	"Just because something is illegal does not make it immoral."    The same with if something is legal; that doesn't mean it's moral. This all depends on how much of this stuff people do. Alcohol in moderation is good for you. I guess one could use that same argument for marijuana as well, considering there are people who use it for medicinal purposes.|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	probably because alcohol has been an accepted part of society since the medieval days (probably even earlier) and the dangers of it were not really known then.  Its a legal drug if you like.    Marijuana falls into a different category.  Its been used for centuries but not as widespread and Im betting that the Chinese who used it centuries ago had no idea of what they were doing to themselves either.  It was seen to be detrimental to health long before the alcohol thing was really looked into.    If you look at the effects that longterm marijuana can have on an individual you would understand why its illegal.    I agree that longterm alcoholism isnt pretty either but the use of alcohol isnt in question here, the use of an illegal substance is.    Whilst it remains an illegal substance to use it is immoral in the eyes of the law.|`|Xy9P5k1yaa	You said it yourself.  Marijuana is illegal, not immoral.  People just have their heads up their asses.|`|iJPHtr0Jaa	Around the turn of the last century governments all over the world had marijuana farms all through their country's. However these crops were not entirely used for the recreational use that marijuana usually is today. Instead the purpose of these marijuana farms was for the hemp industry which was the equal if not better substitute for many materials that were being manufactured such as cotton or even plastic. The government couldn't tax these farms because it was all cash in hand work so they along with the big business's  at the time funded many propaganda campaigns focusing on research into the harmful effects of long term use of it as a drug rather than the practical uses. Because of this marijuana and people in use or possession no longer conformed with the ideals of society at the time so the laws changed to fit with these newly formed ideology's thus making it frowned upon.|`|fVvD5m5Iaa	Weed was introduce during the hippie era, and if you study about  people's attitude's toward hippies, you'll find a lot of where the attitudes from weed comes from. When weed came in it came in with many more dangerous drugs, and weed was basically like the gate in a way.    Alcohol has been here for a longer time and is more associated with once in a while partying,where as weed is associated with homeless potheads or crazy teenagers or drug abuse. While that may not be the actual image of the people who do it, it's the stereotype that comes a long with it.    It's like asking about racial or religious or political attitudes. It's going to take a lot of historical and cultural lessons before you truly understand the concept of the reasoning people make for judgments. And even after studying much, you'll still may not understand.     And as far as I'm concerted many people do not see alcoholics as saints and clean. Generally people do not think of positive connotations with it comes to alcoholic or cigarette abuse.

You also pride yourself as an independent thinker; and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.

Repentance and then receiving baptism is not the way to receive holy spirit, but a faithful life following God's commandments. If a person does it, even if he is a non christian, he can also receive holy spirit and God reveals it to St. Peter in the following part of the scripture:    Acts 10 (47): Then Peter declared, "Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"     Please read the whole chapter. In the end, Peter admits that baptism with repentance is NOT mandatory to receive Holy Spirit. It is the life of a person in God's ways determines his destiny. God bless you!

Since when did ALL people believe in God? Never, many maybe , but not all. Man created God? I'll pass on that logic too. Too often , God is measured by the human mind, He is much more than that.I recognize my own limitations on what I can comprehend and leave the measurement of His greatness against the dimensions of the universes He created, or the simplicity of a blade of grass, which man has not been able to create by his own hand either.

EXurNsB4aa	I'm 100% in support of Black History Month and all other months dedicated to shedding light on the history of other groups who aren't represented accurately or enough in general US History.    There is no white history month because US history has been continually told from a white perspective.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with setting aside time to focus on another perspective.  If you are not a troll I hope you can rethink your position on US history.|`|Thw2IgxQaa	Black History Month isn't going anywhere, so get over it.|`|UnG3dS7xaa	"Everyone thinks their own race is better than the others.

It's about recognizing a part of American history that was long ignored and cannot be forgotten.|`|5PBRR4NVaa	yes and no.  Most history taught in schools is about Europe and Western society so it is important to have a chance to learn about other people's history once in a while.  Had it not been suppressed it wouldn't need its own month.    It's like trying to balance out the whole thing.  Why do I know 1066 was the Battle of Hastings 1492 Columbus discovered America and in 1620 the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth?  I know this because it was drummed into me since Kindergarten when we had to dress like pilgrims and pretend to get along with Indians.  Yet, I know very little about Asia, Black people, South Americans or Russians.

It's celebrating Black history and also American history.    I don't think I really need to discuss why there isn't a white history month. I'm sure you already know that we learn more about white history than we do about any other racial group.  And just about every group has a month that celebrates their history.    Women's History Month is in March  Asian Pacific American Heritage Month is in May  Hispanic Heritage Month is Sept. 15 to Oct. 15  American Indian Heritage Month is in November|`|m2jeeo4Laa	Obviously, you don't understand the reason for Black History month.  It's not insulting other races, but bringing awareness to those in American history who haven't been acknowledged because of their race.  Yes, slavery and Jim Crow laws are outlawed, but we are still feeling the effects.   Sure there are some in every race who believe their race is superior to others, but that is not what Black History month is about.  Take some time out of your day to learn about someone in American history who was African-American and how they benefited the world YOU live in today.  Civil rights laws don't just benefit blacks or any other minority...they benefit you as well.  If you can't see that, then you need to educate yourself.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	Im sorry you feel this way, I honestly think that the more divided a race becomes the more race becomes an issue.

We celebrate white culture every day.|`|ncdTxID9aa	You couldn't search yahoo answers and find this question 10000000 times?  I don't know why people are so frustrated with a black history month.

Its not just whites.  Asians Don't have magazines called ''CHINA'' or "KOREA"  Or AET.  Why is it only whites who complain?|`|wkKJpCwRaa	Crapbag is very right!    Black History Month is in the least bit racist. BHM does not glorify "superiority" of one race, it acknowledges Black History from a Black standpoint which has been long deserved throughout this countries history. BHM is not being racist at all and it is not separating Blacks from the rest. That is the same for Asian Heritage month (May), Hispanic Heritage Month (I'm not sure what month), Native American Heritage,.

All E's are to pronounce.  Instead of schwarz you pronounce swarz. Practice a bit.  Instead of ICH you pronounce ICK  That is typical for Americans, who ar not able to pronounce the CH or the R.  The R is correctly pronounced in rot but not in braun.   Z  The Z in Glatze is correctly pronounced but not in Schnauzer.  The Z is ALWAYS a voiceless letter.
tlUihEOvaa	I agree with you this place sometimes just makes you feel disgusted how some people think.     No I do not think anyone can act a color, behavior is associated with culture, upbringing, and environment yet many people mistaken that for race. What is acting White? What is acting Black?     Sure I see people who fit stereotypes but why should that cause me to judge others? I mean everyone is an individual and it is fact, this isn't about being PC. It is fact that there are people who are influenced by their own way.     Some just act as if we're installed with chips to act a certain way for how we look. We're not robots but humans.|`|TWGWMe5Daa	Exactly.

I don't see how you could completely disconnect from people who are like you.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	Ever see the blue man group?|`|UhtSE2B6aa	Well, you sound like someone that is probably ridiculed for "acting White", I'm assuming this is the reason for this question.      I'm going to put it out there and say yes, people can act like a certain race, not necessarily a stereotype, if you will, but you can tell certain Blacks that grew up around other Blacks versus the ones that do not. So with that said, yes I believe there is an "acting White/Black".     Moreover, I do believe that people are a product of their environment and some Black people (or the opposition) do have the traits of "acting" like another ethnicity honestly.  My advice to you is to be yourself, you'll feel more comfortable in the long run.|`|ckVewstIaa	"Some just act as if we're installed with chips to act a certain way for how we look.

Race is a real thing! Race links to culture, how you were brought up (how your ancestors are brought up)... Race links to heritage, how people of your clan (race) build civilisations... Race links to identity, as all race of men has a homeland which they can truly connect to.    Nowadays, people are just masked with all the other corrupted elements in life. Technology replaces anything from religion to even being able to get out of the house (I've just realised I sat here for 3 hours already).    Being White isn't simply having White skin... The values and family ties they share with each other... the Europe that they link to... and the identity that they have... is special to them... and it's something Non-Whites couldn't understand...     This is also the same with Asians... the 5,000 years of tradition of the Chinese isn't something we could wipe out in one day... the Asian values... culture... prosperity...    Blacks, Latinos, etc.etc.etc. All race of men have this scene of dignity inside them...    The appearance of "foreign objects" just ruin things... One may view that it is ok... the other may view that you're in the way... Getting mad is something that should be understand (although no solutions can be brought forward)    As for acting a colour, you should keep your primary identity and enjoy the rest of the cultures in the world... afterall, that is the optimum!|`|Jz7KDYoEaa	They're all necessarily stereotypes, some things are just mannerisms or inflections that are culturally passed down or maybe even past down through genetics. I don't see using a particular vonacular or thugging is acting black, but there are certain commonalities amongst many people due to their race or ethnic backgrounds. Certain ways of seeing particular issues due to your perception as a black man or a white man or a latino, what have you. Not everyone of a particular race will whare these likenesses but many. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging differences in races, it's cultural, the world was such a large place for so long, people were and still  to an extent used to  being with members of their own race over others therefore these likenesses are natural to us. But stereotypes are a different animal all together, I have no rhythm, can't dance to save my life, but do I have other attributes attributed to being black? Yes! And I have no problem with that, it's who I am. Now, excuse me, I ave to go prepare dinner. Is it fried chicken? Dum dum dum duuuuuum!

lh2H5oSOaa	Islam attaches great importance to marriage, because the family is its basic building block, on which it keeps the foundation of an Islamic society. Islam makes marriage simple and straight and has streamlined the procedure, so that men and women of every financial status could tie the marriage knot.     In holy Quran, Allah SWT encourages people to marry and promises increase in sustenance for those who marry. All the expenditure of marriage rests on the shoulder of bridegroom and bride's father has hardly any responsibility. Dowry or Jahaiz is a curse we inherited from Hindu fore fathers. There is no such thing as Jahaiz in Islam. Learned scholars like Dr. Israr Ahmad have denounced it. And marriages can take place in masjids, as the Christians still solemnize their marriages in Church. So Islam has streamlined the marriage ceremony.       If you happen to hear a marriage lecture  ( Khutba), it always includes Aayats from Surah Nisa and a declaration by  Prophet Muhammad, SAW that :  " Marriage is my way and whosoever fails to follow me (in this respect) is not from me "    So it is not and ordinary sin. Such words have been used by holy prophet on other occasions for those who deceive the faithful or who raise arms against them. So that Aalim has erred who says it is only a Sunnat. No it is obligatory!    Yet some girls or men may not like to marry due to their peculiar circumstances. Lack of proper proposals or lack of ambition for marriage may contribute to circumstances that may lead to a single's life. Sister of one of my friends did not marry, saying its better to live alone than to live with an inappropriate person. She is holding a high position, enjoying her career growth and at the same time supporting her younger brothers and sisters.  Such ladies are worth respecting.    I hope this provides you the information you were looking for.

Whoever among you can support a wife should marry, for that is more modest for the gaze and safer for your private parts.'    --- "When a man marries, he has fulfilled half of his religion, so let him fear Allah regarding the remaining half."       ---Nikah (marriage) is my Sunna. He who shuns my Sunna is not of me.    So according to these hadiths marriage is very important for men and women, and regarding punishment I think there might be punishment  if someone could get married but and chooses not to and shaitan gets the better of them.|`|FJYuMpfoaa	Visit http://www.islamicboard.com to get a more comprehensive answer and to discuss with other fellow Muslims to build a better understanding on this.|`|IbyxsgHhaa	there is no compulsion in religion. In Islam, Allah has said that in the Quran. Should not force anything, especially not marriage.     Marriage is seen as a high blessing, and equal to faith in Islam. It is seen as desirable, as God intended for people to get married, and comfort each other, help each other, and enjoy each other's company. Though not required by any means, it is very much encouraged.
PvgZUzHjaa	Oh, I could watch the entire series all over again there, but I had to draw myself back.  "We are made of star-stuff."    Yes, this sense of wonder is what we need, and the fearlessness to separate facts from imagination.  And I think it may well be something like what people get when they get deeply into religious practices.  I have done enough with various forms of meditation and spiritual practices to suspect that you are right about this.    But the two are not equivalent, in that one is in harmony with our reason and knowledge, and one is not.  One energizes the will to understand more, and the other overwhelms any attempt at rational analysis.  Worse yet, it can be ruined by attempts to understand.    Personally, I prefer Carl Sagan's way.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	I firmly believe that religion and science are two sides of the same coin.

I have Mormon relatives who speak of the "burning of the bosom". A religious connection to God. Maybe our connection to the cosmos is profound and real and maybe we are all energetically a part of it.  Life happens any place it can, maybe we as human beings just happen to have a brain capable of seeing this like a mirror, we know how lucky we are to be able to witness the cosmos from our little place on the planet, a speck in the universe. We are lucky and should be grateful.  A show like "Cosmos" gives the non believer a place to view the awesomeness of life from a point that inspires awe.  God gives the believer that same perspective. In many ways I believe it is the same.

TY8Td3Bmaa	The Jesus story shares similarities with various myths that came before it. The Greek Olympic gods, Artemis and Apollo could both walk on water, Dionysus could turn water into wine. If you compare the sory of Jesus with Mithras, you'll find numerous similarities, from the virgin birth to the date of the birth, to twelve disciples to saving souls to resurecting from the dead. Also, considering the gospels weren't written until after the Roman-Jewish war, by the victors of that war, you'll find takeoffs of various characters whom Josephus describes in his history of that war. The sources are numerous...and at times, the comparisons are humorous...|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	God told each writer what to write.

qWu5F1O2aa	worse is correct. Look at Jimmy Hendrix... he's pretty much the father of rock... that's what started (mainly) 70s rock. Besides, before that blacks were the ones who came up with the 50s rock beat, until the rest of the country caught on and then it was viewed as white... look at jazz, same thing. It seems that everytime blacks come up with something we like it and then take over.|`|k5izERYnaa	What do you mean, black people don't have any prominent rock artists? Black people practically invented rock music.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	I guess you're not aware that some of the most popular rock singers of the 50's and 60's were BLACK.    CHUCK BERRY  CHUBBY CHECKERS  THE PLATTERS  INKSPOTS  LITTLE RICHARD  FATS DOMINO  RAY CHARLES  MARVIN GAYE  JIMMY HENDRIX  TEMPTATIONS  THE SURPREMES  OTIS REDDING  BOOKER T AND THE MG'S  ARETHA FRANKLIN  JAMES BROWN  SAM COOK  DONNA SUMMER  GLADYS KNIGHT  DIANA ROSS  DIONNE WARWICK  These are just a few that I could think of right off.  They don't make them like that anymore.  They don't sing songs like those folks did anymore.  Sad.  Look those names up on YOUTUBE.COM and listen to their songs.|`|42a3494c4c91e3621ec36d45d2b2ef4faa	because most black ppl prefer the beats and rhymes of Hip Hop than guitars, and vocalists screaming|`|1469de7bd315f4ada9d0225c451cdd2aaa	I honestly have no idea.  I love rock and I'm black.  Rock music was created by blacks so it amazes me when people associate it as a white thing and "not black."  And what about Jimi Hendrix? I know he's dead but he was pretty prominent.  And also there are a lot of black rock bands.  Ever heard of T.V. on the Radio?|`|SBF6jqlLaa	Ever heard of lil' Richard? (yeah, he's an older artist,but he created rock n' roll) now, as of today- with all the metal. That is not a sound that many blacks enjoy to create or listen to. (but we do bang out the electric and bass)    add: shame on me, I almost forgot about Jimmy Hendrix - and my boo- PRINCE|`|da4zS4AOaa	There's this African American guy who sang Metal music. I can't remember his name. I'll search|`|ncdTxID9aa	Because most blacks in America grew up listening to Soul, R&B, Hip hop.  I love Rock, and don't care how white that makes me look to some people.  I like anything that sounds good and music that has great messages.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	I like rock, I know there are a lot of black female rockers out there, but seeing it is a white male dominated field but they are breaking through.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Past greats:    Jimi Hendrix -  I mean I know he's dead but still you can't forget him!    Chuck Berry - more of the blues/rock scene - he's still alive!    Bob Marley - I know he was only 1/2 black and played reggae but he was big      Today:    Ben Harper - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Harper  he's pretty main stream for music, not so much hard rock though    Lenny Kravitz - Probably the biggest and closest to what you're asking  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Kravi...|`|DmjSkZSTaa	there are, you just haven't looked hard enough...|`|zQQd2wPRaa	Look, Rock started out in the black community. Jazz, soul,rock-Look at the early rock- Chuck Berry and Little Richard, as well as many vocal doo-wop groups.     White people took over rock music and changed it over time into metal into the 60s/and into now.    For some reason, blacks no longer got into rock, because of what it turned into.    Rock IS A BLACK type of music-from early on.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	There are plenty of Black Rock Artists with too many to mention, but firstly Jimi Hendrix comes to mind.     Lenny Kravitz can be pure rock or mix it w/funk.     There is an influx of R&B, & hip-hop, but those genres include white artists, as well. Music is truly color blind. Your question could be reversed to ask why R&B artists aren't popular in the white community-very far from the truth.     When you hear "The Cult of Personality" on the radio, can you determine their skin color via the sound? It's a hard-rockin song-extremely popular & by no means underground.     Darius Rucker of Hootie & the Blowfish was in a rock genre & has crossed over to country.    BB King can be blues or straight-out R & R. No bones..    Prince-generally termed funk, but listen to his Rock Riffs!    Rock music's biggest influences come from the black community! (Look at Chuck Berry & the clip from "Back to the Future" where he's credited as inventing Rock)    Little Richard influenced the Beatles.  Elvis was influenced by 'black' music.     Tina Turner is more rock than other genres.    In the 50s & 60s a majority of music on jukeboxes were by black artists. This style has a huge following as "Shag Music" in the mid & southern atlantic US. These groups are by no means underground & have large followings. Many still tour or make special appearances today.|`|bribxhsdaa	Because music is cultural. And few black people feel they can identify with the culture of Rock music. Plus, People love to criticise what they don't understand. It's like when a guy in an Iron Maiden t-shirt says "LOLOL RETARDS ATTEMPT POETRY" and some guy in a wu-tang t-shirt says "LOLOLOL THATS JUST NOISE AND SCREAMING WITH INSTRUMENTS"    - Both are ignorant for lacking knowledge on that which they criticise.    I sure as hell can't. The only reason i like Rock/Metal is because i play instruments. But culturally, I can't really identify with it as much as i can with Hip Hop.     In the UK, One of the biggest bands is Bloc Party who are fronted by a Black guy.     To be honest, I don't think Rock will ever be Black music on the level of say Hip Hop or Jazz or Funk or Blues. Which isn't neccesarily a bad thing. Plus, I read an article a while ago about a lot of ethnic musicians not being marketable....Like Alex Lifeson from Rush has a really eastern european name which he doesn't go under...I took that as black musicians being the next step (visually)    Rap and Metal are my two favourite genres...Shame they won't get off each others nuts.|`|6NEPcZFfaa	There are lots of black rockers. They are usually know in the bands instead of lead singers. but I listen to all kinds of music everyone from Nirvana to Metallica, The Eagles, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Korn, Lynard Skynard, ... all kinds of music. Personally I think 1970's rock was the best decade. Fall out Boy or Panic @ the Disco should not be considered anywhere near rock!|`|UnG3dS7xaa	Black people were the main innovators of rock music in it's infancy, but abandoned it, probably because the "cultural climate" of the time wasn't conducive to the black music scene. Many rock chords originate in the blues, and rock's first stars were black (Little Richard, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers etc.).|`|cYuGYhGmaa	Hendrix  Living Color  Kings X  Bad Brains  Fishbone  DH Peligro  Sevendust    I think it has something to do with being "White music"  Stupid......  Whitefolk go to hip-hop concerts!  I don't understand why Black people insist on limiting themselves.|`|AA11962152	That's a question I always wanted to know the answer, too.  Yeah, like other people here said you have Jimmy Hendrix and the group Living Color's amazing Cult of Personality song and Lenny Kravitz, but these rockers, regardless of the fact that they were black, resonate with white people mostly because they make and sing rock music.      Rock music, it seems, is perceived by black people culturally as not appealing as soul, r&b, hip hop, funk, blues.  I'm not a music historian, but I believe that blues and hip hop are important to black people because they represent forms of music that were created out of their own historical experiences.  Blues was created from slaves working the fields to boost their spirit; Hip hop was born from the despair of living in the poor inner city neighborhoods.  It seems rock music has never had cultural or historical significance to black people, and if it did, like Jimmy Hendrix, they chose to ignore it and consider it an anomaly.    This is just my opinion based on interaction with black people, but I think a majority of black people wouldn't be caught dead listening and enjoying rock music.  If they did, they would be ridiculed by their black friends/family/associates.  It's almost a requirement that they only listen to music that's acceptable to the black community.|`|d50J4Acsaa	This is just a theory, but I think that because segregation was taking place only a few decades ago that a majority of the first Hip-Hop artists had family who grew up in lower-class communities. They used it as an artistic way to express how they grew up in a family who had a racist past and the rest of the Black community could relate to it and soon it became one of the largest music genre's in the country.

mG6Pu12Paa	Ok, to answer this question again.  (Don't you ever get tired of asking this question?)  To properly quote from the Bible (since you obviously have access to one.)  You can't just take one verse and base a argument on it.  Read John 6:49 through 6:58 to understand John 6:53.    To paraphrase for you Jesus is saying that their Fathers ate bread and died.  But Jesus is the living bread that if you eat this representative bread you won't die put live forever in Heaven.  The wine represents his blood that was to be spilt when he was to be crucified.      He did this because he knew that Judas Iscariot was going to betray him.     My question to you is: If you don't believe in God or Jesus what diffrence does it make in your life what others belive?|`|UxooffHZaa	Magic is Magic.   Accepted Magic is called Mass, while Magic that is not accepted by society is called Witchcraft.  Metaphorical sacrifices have always helped the tribe/congregation, whether the first Shaman sacrificing part of their mammoth dinner to the honor of the great Mammoth God, in his honor, so the tribe could continue to find food, to modern sacrifice of wheat, symbolically flesh in the Eucharist.  Really, the human mind hasn't changed much since the time when Mammoths roamed Europe, should we really be so daft as to expect our psychological needs have changed?|`|dLVoWjwOaa	Actually, we Pagans condemn any kind of human sacrifices.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	No. Obviously you are ignorant of covenant law. Covenant law has symbols that represent body and blood. Covenants are forever. Covenants are agreements in perpetuity between two people for certain considerations and these go down through the generations. When we have communion we are remembering the Covenant we have with God through His Son Jesus Christ.|`|xqn0U0H6aa	No but it is just a very sick religion.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	From what I remember it originated with Osiris.

Pagan has become a word that represents anyone that does not follow the 'biblical' faith.  Pagan actually means country dweller.  In these modern times pagan is associated with certain earth loving religions such as Buddism- Buddists do not have human sacrifice, eat flesh or drink blood.    So remove the idea of Pagan from the concept.   You may also want to do some investigations into 'who' the Son of Man really is; start with the Nephilim|`|8c0d15366f972f0fe93e20c73c8bda50aa	I'd have to say that it's not a true pagan tradition (as far as traditions are today).

Try reconciling that verse and others with the {FALSE} doctrine of Hellfire.    Contrary to popular belief, hell is not a place of eternal torment. The Greek word Haides from which we get hell, and it's Hebrew equivalent sheohl, refers to the common grave of mankind; the patriarch Job prayed "O that you would hide me in sheol {hell}"[Job 14:13 Amplified Bible], meaning that he wanted a quick and painless death to end his suffering. Think about it; would you punish a child for some misdemeanor by holding his or her hand over a hot stove? the doctrine of Hellfire is a repugnant affront to a God of love.

For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.

When you ask jesus to cPome into your heart, you are asking him to come dwell in you and preside inside as an inner light or hope you could say.  By asking him to do so, you become accountable for your actions to him because you have acknowledged in your heart and mind the codes of christ.. or commandments..     If you live a life day to day trying you best to live a life with the same basic morals the bible depicts of christ.. the commandments.. then as a reward ur granted  the chance of eternal life in heaven..    its kinda like this.. you spend you 80 years serving God and following him, listening to him, and doing the acts of Christ, then then you will be given a eternal life of happiness as a reward..    revelations talks about the rapture..      the rapture comes before the tribulation..    tribulation is the testing of man for so many years, where he decides to live for  himself, or stand up for god.. the bible states that at that time Christ spirit will be drawn from earth and people will have to make there decision based on faith alone and without the teacher"the holy spirit" if you don't accept the mark of the beast.. believed to be 666... and live within those years or die standing for him.. you are granted eternal life.. kinda like a second chance..    people who have lived a good life pre-tribulation are believed to exempt the tribultion and go ahead to heaven for living a good and sure life..  the bible states that gods people shall not see his wrath.. thats why we believe that the rapture will happen before tribulation..    revelations tell about it the best.. and an niv bible is usually easiest for me to understand..   here's a link to some bible sites|`|WdlOVQBYaa	read revalations|`|aFnxvO1faa	let the proselytizing begin!|`|lU0vkHK2aa	Read "revelations" in the bible.

Psalms|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	tobe saved means that u have accepted Jesus as your saviour , you have confessed it with your mouth and believe it with your heart! ppl will tell u that noone knows if they are going to heaven, but i disagree! GOd does not have his ppl walking around serving him and not be sure of thier final destination. If you Love everyone and have no hate in you and beleive in God and in all your ways acknowledge HIm, you shall know that u wil inherit eternal life! dont be like all these other chrisitans that are unsure of their fate. Know that u know that u know that u are going to heaven. yup we will all be judged in the flesh according to the works that we did in the flesh, while yet on earth!    Rapture - GOd will come back for his ppl, take them up and leave the others behind.. plain and simple!|`|uAMzmAwaaa	during the rapture, those saved will be "taken up" so probably they will be here one second and gone the next, quite possibly leaving their cloths behind (as God gives them robes). i personally think it will happen at the end of the tribulation because it mentions those raptured will meet Jesus in the sky. during judgment everyone gets judged (saved or not) the difference is those who are saved aren't being judged on whether they go into the lake of fire (note: the lake of fire is not hell, as it mentions that hell will be cast into the lake of fire near the end of Revelation) but rather their judgment to reward them for what they did with their lives.    while you should get baptized after you are saved it is just an act of obedience and does not save you. but still... you are unwilling to get baptized can you really call yourself a Christ follower (what Christian means)|`|AyoTrRpzaa	Being saved means that you believe that Jesus, the Son of the Only Living God, came to earth as a mortal and died for the sins of all people and rose again on the third day.  Being baptized doesn't save you, it is just a public proclamation of your faith in Jesus.  The rapture is a little more confusing.  This site might help, http://www.godsholyspirit.com/christian_...    And as for judgement, all will be judged, Christians and non-Christians alike.  Christians will probably be judged by how they followed Christ and non-Christians will be judged for not following Christ.|`|GCYljlZuaa	my church adress is 21224 carson figueroa  its called peace apostolic. the pastor is excellent and he talks about this message like evry week now  http://www.peaceapostolic.com/    bt basically it not 2 much detail, pretty soon, there will be whats called a rapture or second coming in which god will return a 2nd time to earth and collect all people that have been filled with his holy spirit    *in order to recieve his holy spirit you must speak in other tounges and be baptized in jesus' name(this part is very very important b/c most ppl think you can be saved by believing in god alone or just by doing good works bt this in not true, thats only part of it)  (btw to know what speaking tounges means is wayy to hard to explain b/c its a experience god gives you in which you speak in an unknown language(not like chinese, spanish, or anything bt a language that god only knows and its given to you by god it sounds crazy bt its the only way;if confused read Acts 2:38 and ch.2,3,4    bt anyway, bak to the rapture.....after god comes bak for his ppl, he will take them back to heaven and wait for the next big event which is called armegedon, or the war to end all worlds, this is officially known as the end of the world. Its done so god can create a new heaven on earth. His new jerusalem. Bt b4 all that happens, right after god ascends into the air, the tribluation will begin which is a 7 yr period of hell on earth. all kinds of horrible things will take place on earth during that time. Thats the time in which most ppl no that the devil will try to trick ppl into getting his mark."666"    Theres so much more to that story but if you want it explained better or more in detail cause i know ur probably definetley confused at this point, i totally recommend you come to my church or please, please, please email me with anymore questions. I'd be more than happy to answer anymore better than i just did and send you info on it.    email:music-peace-love@hotmail.com|`|zUMvC6QEaa	There is no rapture. The Lord affirms that Baptism and the Eucharist are both necessary for salvation. The Church established by Christ possesses the fullness of the means of salvation. You cannot say "I am saved" while you are still living. If you do you are committing a sin of presumption. All personal sins and original sin are forgiven when you are baptised. After Baptism,all sins need to be forgiven through the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Outside the Church there is no salvation.|`|z5ivAuv0aa	No one really knows what going to happen.You just have to be saved and youll be fine.My Grandmother says everyone that is a Christian will dissapear but my Papa said well I cant remember what he said because he died.All I know if your a Christian youll be ok.

doPPYJIkaa	- . I do believe people can live forever, in the way the bible describes, which is not the exact way we are alive today, but more like our spirits live forever.    - Don't forget that the God of the christians is the same God as the jews and the muslims worship, allthough the religions have differences. (But the live forever part through the son of God, is only christianity for now)    - Why does God care so much about the small step man have to go to live forever?  I would say that maybe only those who deserve it can get it. The ones who show a little bit of trust unto God. If you don't care about God at all, or don't believe in anything he has to say, I don't think you are worthy to just get eternal life without doing anything at all. If I was God, I would not like to have all the people who didn't show me any trust or anything around me forever..?    Well... Thank God it's such a small step to take, then ;)|`|t1NTGuIZaa	do you have any kids?  if you do, you love all of them, whether you have 1 or 13 of them.

y49j8gyAaa	catholics- there is no life on other planets, and dinosaurs might have existed as long as it fits in with God creating the world. There is always the possibility that carbon dating is wrong because carbon levels were so high during the time that the dinosaurs existed.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	1.  Yes absolutely dinos existed    2.  Life on other planets? No one knows one way or another yet, but it's certainly plausible    eKathy: Carbon dating is not used to date dino fossils.  C-14 dating is only effective up to 60,000 years back.  Other methods are used|`|0HLOLwXKaa	As a Christian i definitely believe that dinosaurs existed...just not millions of billions of years ago. God describes something that sound like a dinosaur right in the Bible...the word dinosaur is not used....it wasn't invented yet. God talk about the behemoth....it's description does not match up with any living animal.....as for life on other planets....I don't believe that God created life on other planets.  He made this Earth and put us on it....|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	of course I believe in dinosaurs.  Genesis says God created the heavens and the earth.  It does not say HOW He did it or how long His 7 days actually were.  To God a day can be a thousand years and vice versa.  Life on other planets is possible.  Time will tell.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	It sounds like you already formed your own answer. Still, as a Christian, I will answer: I do know that dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago. As for the aliens, I can't say that I have seen any as yet. They are as likely to exist as we do, though.|`|UptQ1JFZaa	That would depend on the person, the religion as a whole has no standard belief when it comes to those.    But I would say that Robert Bakker destroys any argument that Christians don't accept dinosaurs, evolution or the age science gives the earth.  In case you don't know who he is he is one of the world's most recognized and prominent paleontologists as well as a pentecostal minister|`|I5ycd8jUaa	Sure it would be stupid not to believe in dinosaurs. And life on other planets is something different since it doesn't have any proof, but anyways I believe in it because it would be really odd that God made life only on one of the millions of planets...|`|F1BLIbQKaa	I'm christian and I believe that dinosaurs existed... I mean, after all, their fossils are all over this planet. And I also believe that there is life on other planets. Maybe not in our solar system, but somewhere out there.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Yes, many do believe that the fossil record is accurate and that the earth is much "older" than the 6,000 or so years specified by some religious teachings. As to life on other planets, there is nothing in the Bible to indicate there isn't.|`|XNGRQlmDaa	Although I find your question rather insulting, I'll answer it anyway. Yes there were Dinosaurs (the fossils of them are everywhere..Duh), and as far as life on other planets, why shouldn't there be. The Bible doesn't say that earth is the only planet with life on it, there very well could be life on other planets. I'm just hoping that they aren't as insulting as you.|`|6bKws0fAaa	well there are dinosaur fossils  of course they exist    about life on other planets...i do not know       now how was that arrogant?|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Despite the fact that you're rude, I'll answer anyway.    I'm a Christian, I believe dinosaurs existed and that the potential for life on other planets is wide open.    God bless you.|`|ihqzBL9daa	I'm a Christian who believes dinosaurs existed.  As for life on other planets, I believe it is likely considering the fact that there are billions of galaxies in our universe.

db9Q5ddlaa	it doesnt stop my dear. the bible explains everything. although ive heard that your soul leaves your body at the speed of light and the next person u see, is GOD!  I feel bad for atheists...i mean, its better to believe in God and he doesnt exist, than to not believe in him and he does exist. but i believe whole heartedly that he exists!|`|GEfUTyi8aa	You are quite young to be concerned about this... I sense you are.    I fear death because I have children... i am afraid to leave them behind.... I dont believe in the bible... but I am not an atheist.... i am more or less on the fence... i think there is something that is repsonsible for all this but I dont know exactly what or if that being is even still in existence.   i dont like to think of it all just ending... and then nothing... but I am afraid that is what happens.... we just stop breathing... we go to sleep... like when you dont dream.... and we dont know whats going on..... we are no more.    Its not a great thing to think about... especially if you love living.... I like being alive but death is inevitable and I can admit at times it keeps me awake.... especially after a death of a family member... I am at the age where people... grandparents, aunts, uncles are dying.... and these people were around my whole life... and suddenly gone.... it makes me realize my immortality.... and then I think too much about it....     I would like to say there is an afterlife... but I dont know.... but I do ask how can we explain the paranormal... there has been much evidence of ghosts..... so it makes me wonder about a sort of after-life... but it doesnt mean I am going to just believe in that... maybe those are people who never lived... maybe they are not even people... but of some paralled life to ours....    Your 15... I hope you dont worry about this....your a christian and well, then you believe in heaven... so just do that accept and respect what others believe, maybe none of us are right, maybe we are all right in some sense... we wont know until we get there....|`|AA10329469	Most humans are just scared of death .Though we are taught so many aspects of life but rarely if ever,about death.Many religions ,faiths or lack of it,have been ascribed certain views or characterstics of death but in actual practice,all people tackle with it in their own  and personal manner.To say that all Christians or atheists view and deal with death in a uniform way would be misleading and wrong.If it isn't cessation of life then what is death?There is nothing to grasp but to experience it or feel it but difficult to describe it.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	Its a passing from life to super life Star,  Love Kent|`|GJS3hTK5aa	Except humans, no other creature thinks about life after death. The reason being, God has not given them wisdom. As for me, death is one of the real truths on earth, that opens our way to an eternal unknown life. I am sure death is not an end, but a beginning. I am very sure about it, because Jesus is truth and he defeated death.

I've never really had a problem accepting death, but a few months ago, it just kind of hit me that if i don't believe in a god... then death is just it. It really upset me. I didn't even want to go to bed because its just one more day til you die and never see your family again. And i mean if this is it then whats the point, you're just gonna die and can't take anything with you? what about all the memories you build up?     I'm still very unsure about an afterlife. But i realized that i have to use every minute i have, cause its not coming back. I starting talking to my family more and being nicer to strangers and excepting of what makes other people happy!|`|tEn2nnsuaa	death can't be grasped after death because the brain stops working.|`|4YXiG0jWaa	Ok, no harsh words.  Death can sound very frightening but a very wise man (Aristotle) said that he did not fear death because how could he fear something he didn't know about?  In other words, would it make sense to be afraid of something you have no knowledge about?  Fear is merely a physiological response of your body to a threat.  Your heart beats faster, your blood pressure rises, your pupils dilate, and your body is filled with a feeling to make you take action (run or fight).  Now, if you are dead, your body will not have these responses.  You won't feel fear because you won't have a body.  Look at this way, there are two prevailing notions about death:  The Christians says you will go to heaven.  In which case, you have nothing to fear.  The Atheists say you will have no experience at all.  In which case, you have nothing to fear.  You can't even experience fear or remorse or pain or anything else because these are biological responses that happen within the body.|`|E3v6Ctffaa	Well for this you must believe in a eternal (permanent) soul (mind,spirit)  And the only answer about this that I found to make sense with my own reason , observation in life. Is the one of Siddhartha Gautama , a very wise men some sort of explorer of the mind and the science of reality.    It goes like this :  {What we conceive as something eternal within us, is merely a combination of physical and mental aggregates or forces (made up of body or matter , sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness. These forces are working together in a flux of momentary change; they are never the same for two consecutive moments. They are the component forces of the psycho-physical life.  Consciousness depends on matter, sensation, perception and mental formations and that cannot exist independently of them}    Since nothing is created or lost , energy cannot be destroyed. It cannot be the end , a void. The only mention of void annihilated itself since thinking about it makes it impossible. But what does happen ? , probably some sort of transformation , not a counscious one tho. Life and death , In this universe everything is constantly changing , all is subject to change ,  It moves around in cycles , if you observe life and keep a open mind  you will be able to understand that reality cannot be grasp with a critique mind , conceptual thoughs.

By the way, I missed the part in church history about Joseph Smith running every morning through the woods holding the plates.

I am not judging you on what you believe, but I do think you should really think before speaking.

LuN1unJ3aa	Caffeine is a mildly addictive drug and when used as an additive, adds no nutritional value. Like other addictions, the addictive nature varies with each person. Addiction of any kind is not a good thing, but one which is added, simply to guarantee continued sales (which is why Coca-Cola adds it in place of a very mild dose of cocaine before it was outlawed back in 1914, uses it) it is not a good thing.

They all have caffeine in them, and caffeine is addictive. Being addicted to things is bad. As for the 'beached whales', some people are just naturally big no matter how hard they try to lose weight.

FyLfEPv0aa	Ok, first of all it's nearly 14 million, but more than half are outside of the US.    So out of your numbers of 12,000,000 one could assume that only 6,000,000 actually live in the US so out of those 6,000,000 you say that 4,000,000 are active.    That's 2/3rds my boy!  Please go find me a catholic church or other denomination with 2/3rds attendance every week.  That is a huge pecentage of activity.    Most who aren't active when asked about their religion state that they are LDS but they don't attend.  They consider themselves LDS, so do we, so who are you to say they're not.  That's like saying that only 30% of Americans are really Americans because the rest don't vote regularly; it's a dumb statement.      By the way, your comment about people joining for the free food is racist and ignorant, the free food is nonexistent, it's donated by locals and so unless there is a disaster they don't get food, they donate food.

Members who are excommunicated or have their membership removed are still counted among the membership of the Church. There are currently over 1 million members who have resigned yet are still counted as active.     *Inactive members and those who have moved on to other Churches are also still counted among the membership.       12 million members on the books, but only about half of them would be considered active. Only a small amount of them have attended the mormon temple for their "endowment."    The LDS church grows is poor countries, think about where the internet is not everywhere.  See this article...  http://www.sltrib.com/ci_2890645    The Mormon Church growth is down to 3% per year.    Based on growth, Jehovah's Witnesses is more true church than Mormon Church.    NOTE: Hinckley lied about the numbers.

UvYzQv5Saa	Misconception  1 is that BDSM is about sex.     It is not. While sex and sexual activity can and often is accompanied with bdsm, it is not about sex. It's about control. And about trust. I can cite many an example of a situation where there was no sex at all.     BDSM includes Bondage. the art of tying someone up. This can be done with cuffs, tape, straps, chain or rope. It can be rudimentary, it can be medieval, and it can be beautiful (See Shibari). It's the idea of placing a submissive in a restrictive setting so that they have no control, the dominant has that control.     Then there is Discipline. In order to assert the control over a submissive, the dominant sometimes has to "show who is the boss" This is done through discipline much like a parent would do to a child. This may involve a spanking, a time out, or denying something that the submissive wants or enjoys.    Then next part of the BDSM acronym is Dominance and submission. A dominant is the one in control. They receive and take the control from the submissive that is willing given and relinquished.     The last part of the acronym is sadism and masochism. This is what people normally hear about the lifestyle. The beatings, the whippings and the tortures. The whole lifestyle is not comprised of people who like to give or receive pain. You have submissives who are very much into service. There are some that are into sensations. Some that are into embarrassment or humiliation. And with each of the hundreds of levels of each fetish or area of interest, there are going to be people who love something and dislike something else. Its a small part of a huge lifestyle.    The most important facets of a bdsm relationship involves trust (in your partner and in yourself), communication (this has to be high else you can expose each other to some very raw emotions), and the primary guideline to the lifestyle: SAFE SANE & CONSENSUAL.    You need to play safe. Safety first always. Play Sane, meaning don't be involved in this when you are intoxicated or high or angry. It's about control. So you need to be in control when you either give it to the dominant or take it from the submissive. Consensual: You can't take control without there be a willingness to have the control given to you.     If you would like to talk with me more in depth, i would be happy to help you navigate through this lifestyle. It may be something that you will enjoy, and it might be something that you are  just not interested in. But unless you ask the questions (which, it is good to see that you are) and get the right answers, you won't know.     My first question to you is: Do you want to take control and can you take control. If you want to try (at least), ask him about the lifestyle again, and if he gets shy and embarrassed about it, Indicate "sternly" that this is something he brought to your attention and you want answers. Then find out what his interests are. Like i said there are hundreds of possibilities. (you can contact me for some "questionnaires" that will help you understand some of them.)    k|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	BDSM is an umbrella term based on Bondage& Discipline (BD), Dominance & Submission (DS), Sadism & Masochism (SM).  "Sub" is short for "submissive", so he would be the one in chains and getting dominated or whipped.  If that is a significant part of his sexuality it is not something he should have to give up to be in a relationship, he would never be satisfied or content under such circumstances, so you would need to decide if it's something that could work for you.  A good reference work for further information would be "Screw the Roses, Send me the Thorns" by Phillip Miller and Molly Devon.|`|pVnUhYLQaa	I don't have an answer of my own because Kerin said it best. Just wanted to second Kerin's answer.|`|khwrCgPzaa	um it means you like to have sex with leather and chains and think that torture is kinky   ehh if you dont like any of that and he likes that then the sex could get awkward and unfun for both of you|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	lmao lmao lmao|`|oVeGMNsLaa	First thing you want to do is educate yourself on the basics.  Some good resources:    http://www.amazon.com/When-Someone-You-L...    (It's a great book- written especially for those who are really new and kind of scared).    http://www.amazon.com/101-Realistic-Intr...    This website has a lot of good information.  Even though it's geared towards straight men and women, most of BDSM transcends gender or sexual orientation, so it's helpful for anyone:    http://www.xeromag.com/fvbdsm.html    Your second step, once you understand a little, is to talk to him.  No matter how embarrassing.  You can keep it light or talk about it seriously, but you need to find out the following:    * How important is it to him?  Does he need a partner who is also into BDSM?  Could he have a vanilla relationship?    * What turns him on?  There are so many types of BDSM play, from someone liking to be blindfolded and kissed sensuously to full-on c*ck and ball torture and whipping.    * What has he done before?  What are his limits?    Tell him how you feel about it.  Tell him you're new, that you're curious, and that you want to be supportive.    Kinky people and non-kinky people get together all the time.  Does it make it a little difficult?  Yes, of course- just like when two people with differences of any sort have to work out their problems.  But you can certainly make it work.    Good luck!|`|c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	My personal feelings would be to run for the hills and don't look back...       But, as you know, we cannot help who we fall in love with, so....       Bondage, domination, sadism, masochism is not something that you wake up one day and decide I think I'll be a sub(submissive) or a dom(dominant), so please do you homework and choose carefully.  He, being a sub, means that he like to be tortured, or humiliated, like with anything from clothespins on his nipples to shoving a baseball bat in his rear end, depending on how much pain he can stand.  There is usually a "safe" word that is agreed upon before you start your session, that he can say at anytime to signal you to stop.  If he's a sub, he would want to be with a dom, which would mean that you have to be the one handcuffing him and placing the clothespins on him, or inserting the baseball bat, etc.  If that's something you would be interested in Good Luck.  If not, be his friend, but look elsewhere for the warm cuddly boyfriend...|`|TTfTTlcCaa	PLEASE don't let close-minded people who don't know what they are talking about (and fully admit that their source is "gossip") deter you from a relationship with someone you are interested in because of their misconceptions.    Get off of yahoo, and do some research on this.  Start with wikipedia.  Then, talk to him.  See what "he's in the leather/bdsm community" means to him.  Everybody is different.  It could mean he likes to rock chaps once in a while and dance to George Michael.  It could means he can't orgasm unless his nads are in a vice.  ASK HIM.  He wouldn't have brought it up if he didn't want to talk to you about it.    It may still work out even if you decide it's not for you.  It's all a matter of degree.    Open mind, open communication.  Then, go from there.        EDIT:  I am a sub and I don't have any interest in being tortured or humiliated.  Just for the record.|`|wNZ6VoFDaa	He is tellng you about his interests because he needs for you to be involved in the BDSM/leather community if you are going to have a RELATIONSHIP.  He also told you he is a sub, so this means he needs for you to be the Dominant Partner.  This is why he is telling you.      Learn about the BDSM/leather Community, and if you are genuinely interested then pursue him.  If you have NO interest in the BDSM/leather Community please tell him and back away from the relationship or be clear that you can only be friends.  In fact, I am sure that he would be able to tell if your interest in the BDSM/leather Community were genuine or a lie anyway.

kzgmFekKaa	The name would probably be translated as 'Hotatei' or 'Hotatewi'.    The last syllable, '' is actually obsolete and at first I didn't recognise it because it is virtually unused (it would have originally been pronounced 'wi', then shifted to 'i', then been merged with  which also is 'i').    I don't know what the actually meaning of the name is, but seeming that you've said 'it's a username of a sort', I'm guess the name meaning (translation) is not what you are after and that you just want how it's written in English (transliteration).    EDIT: The previous answerer said 'hotatemi' - this is wrong, but I can understand why that is their answer when  looks like the syllable  (mi).|`|RYCHEG1iaa	hotate:>:+  common noun  scallop    wi:>:+  common nounObsolete term.   hiragana for "wi"    ^_^|`|c7da44bc85987393a834f86511b1c87eaa	I think Christian M is right.

Most Christians understand that gay people were born the way they are, because the rest of us were also born with our own thing or two that we must deal with.    God accepts anyone who repents, asks for forgiveness, refrains from sin and follows what Jesus taught us.    To really understand, ask yourself this as well: Will gay people ever accept religion?    God bless you.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	A few effeminate men go to my church, I dont know whether they are practicing homosexuals but nobody asks or judges them, its their relationship with God not mine.|`|4YXiG0jWaa	It will probably take a LONG time.

But notice how good those same people are at ignoring all the evidence about evolution because it goes against their interpretation of a very old and unscientific book.|`|KvwVBzb0aa	Specify your religion. Not all religions do not accept gays and there are actually many Christian groups that accept gays. No, I do not believe that those who do not accept gay people would accept them no matter what. It seems people just need to hate anyone who is different which is a shame.  I have many gay friends that have added so much to my life and I would be at a great loss had I chosen to not accept and love them in the name of religion! Blessings|`|QJT5JXf2aa	I believe that regardless of the gay gene being found (which, it already has been in fruit flies), they will have to accept gays to survive.    The world is becoming more and more tolerant and less and less close minded. Religion is no longer a good reason to be intolerant and people are changing rapidly.    I believe if any religion is to survive, they're going to have to cut intolerance and hatred out of the equation to survive.|`|DZNdxcnhaa	Some will, some won't.  I hope every religious bigot has a child or parent come out of the closet.|`|oJ6yixyGaa	There are many religions that accept gays. Just because the Christian-Judeo cultures have a choke hold on the western world doesn't mean homosexuals cannot have religions that don't intrude into the bedroom.    For instance, most of the earth religions; Wicca, Thelema, Native American and Gnosticism view same sex preference as equal to opposite sex preference, as do many eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism.    The Christian mindset is prevalent in the western world, but it shouldn't dominate anyones mind or heart.

And now we come to the gays...who have been mistreated, beaten, murdered...because 'the Bible' says so...  I AM a Christian...and I DO believe in 'the Bible'...BUT, I don't believe in the particular 'interpretations' with which different people have chosen to burden the Sacred Scriptures...

beVx83VBaa	A lot of this depends on the mother tongue of the person you ask, as that will have a lot of impact on how they perceive English sounds.    To Western Europeans, (especially those with phonetic languages like Spanish, Italian, etc.), it sounds like English speakers eat their words.  This is more so with Americans than the British.  It is also hard for non-English speakers to discern where one word ends and another begins, because often a short sentence sounds like one word when spoken quickly.  Another English sound that dominates is the unique "r" which has no equivalent in the other major world languages.  An Italian once told me that when Americans speak, it sounds like this:  "arr - rah - rah - rah"    Examples of a sentence pronounced as one word:  1) whatchamacallit - what is that thing called?  2) Idunno - I don't know  3) wherejugo? - where did you go?|`|6AqdyWgzaa	It sounds very crass and unsophisticated like:    Grinky boinker durkinfoik gluckabucka smork gafoinkle smorgle.

Geddaahda heah! ya blope.    Compared to other dictions American English is like the cheez-whiz of languages. It's like low-class trailor-trash speak.

The only way I can feel assured of accomplishing what I want to accomplish is if I go by myself.

ztb7OCvyaa	I think your statistics are off. 44% of black men are not with white women, the majority of black men are actually with black women. 70% of black women are unmarried, not single (there's a difference). People like the black guy on Youtube bashing black women do not speak for an entire race of people. I've seen enough white guys bashing minority women too, does that mean they speak for every white guy? Hardly.    Look, date who you want to date. It's not my job to convince you. If you end up with a white guy or whatever, big deal. But let it be because you care about him, not because you think white guys are "better" than black guys. I've been in and out of interracial relationships for over a decade (and I'm in one right now) and I can tell you that a**holes come in all colors. So before you treat a guy of another race as a prize, remember that he's just a guy like any other and it may be him, not a black guy, who screws you over.|`|FYjf7hkEaa	True. And have you ever seen a black guys schlong? Ugh, they`re ugly.  Go for white every time.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	I dont think you should date a black man, because your heart is fixated on white men. Black men are turning to white women, have been for awhile- but there are some who still love black women, and some who are good men. However, this is not to persuade you, if you like white men- go for it, but don't talk about black men as if they are the scum of the earth. Or black people for that matter. Just live in your world with all whites and be happy. If you are not part of our community's upbuilding, then you are part of the problem.    add: you are part of the problem when you bring strife- that is what I mean.|`|ZRqSpl1Aaa	I think you should just go with whoever you're attracted to. There are good black guys out there.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	You're pathetic, you need to get it together and figure your ownself out instead of trying to analyze others. No one has to prove you wrong. You are wayyyy below handling a Black man, I'm sure they really wouldn't want a chick like yourself. If you think "others" are gonna kiss your @ss, honey think again, they'll be laughing at you because you are society's fool.|`|ncdTxID9aa	You are going way overboard.  I think I observed some truthful topics from your first question which I had agreed with, but you are being subjective in your opinions which is why more people are lashing out at you.  There's a difference between truth and opinion.  You express your disliking for ghetto black people but you don't know every black person.  I've dated mostly black men, they aren't the stereotypical black people you keep referring to.  They may even speak some ebonics but they were respectful, educated and as I know them today they aren't out in the street, getting women pregnant non of that nonsense.  You need to expand your horizons if you really want to know decent black people.  I don't think it's hard, I just think you want to vent your frustrations about people you know.|`|1eoMM4DLaa	Two more points.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	so your kids will look like you|`|kwYbe4n6aa	to respect ur own race|`|PLtU5AuYaa	My brother is an Olympic hopeful at 15, my father a teacher, former marine, received 2 bronze stars and numerous awards, my cousin plays football for the university of Florida and goes on an academic scholarship, my uncle owns his own businesses across NY.

A black girl pulling race card regarding black men. LOL    I'm white and I happen to know a lot of great black men. Men that are sweet and love their families and treat them with respect. Not to mention they are not in jail and have good jobs.    Haha I have heard sooo many funny things about black women from black men. In fact I have asked the question "Why do so many black men date white women" before. The answer I always got was that black women are "B**chy", "controlling", "overly demanding" and "drama queens". Funny huh? Yet, I know so many black women who do not fit that criterea and white women who do. LOL    It's also funny when a black man dates a white woman. I've seen black women get POed and saying how white women are "taking their men". I'm sorry I didn't know that because of someone's skin color that ment they "belonged" to people of the same race.    Black men sterotype huh? That's another funny one because I know PLENTY of white men that are everything you mentioned about black men. What is it just not as noticeable because their white? I don't get it.    Overall people are going to have their views and opinions on other people no matter what. But just because you bite into one bad apple, doesn't mean the rest of the bunch will be sour too. In other words, just because one red apple was bad, doesn't mean you should start eating green ones because of. Both groups will always have bad ones in them.    Who you date or who you don't date shouldn't be based on racial stereotypes but on what & who treats you well and makes you happy.    Guys in school huh? Oh they are just dumb boys trying to act like what they see on TV and hear in music. That goes for all races. Boys do grow up you know. They won't always act like that.     There is always an exception to every "rule" and rules were ment to be broken. :)|`|HGfUY3lbaa	lol i say this thing on tv befor that said black women and asiaen man should get togehter because they have the highest single percentile. but any way they way i see it is skin color dosent matter to me if i like them and we have stuff in commen hell then go for it but if you dont like the way the person is dont date him|`|HRXTcAxQaa	you being black is reason enough.|`|7sgJuukQaa	Since you say you are BLack......why don't you ask your own.....family why you should start dating another "Black"......since you are "self-hating"......I'm sure they are so.......proud of you....(not)........
73zdU7m1aa	I think they should be encouraged to tell their teachers when these kinds of things happen.  I think that sometimes kids are too afraid to get their friend into disciplinary action or be "jumped" by the person that got in trouble.  I wished schools would teach kids manners and how to react when bullied.      You can find some free curriculum for schools on this topic at http://www.operationrespect.org|`|x2XyyFV6aa	I've never heard of this. If someone is getting bullied they should head straight to a  trusted teacher or any teacher or staff member and their parents. STRAIGHT AWAY.|`|5153ef7a295a5ae9c948668eb5b9bef0aa	Ive never heard of this either...  All Ive ever heard is that they should tell a teacher, adult, parent, or someone if they are being bullied.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	there is Zero tolerance  in schools today against bullying  with  strict consequences to the abusers|`|ype5N1qEaa	There is a difference between being bullied and being picked on.  You also mentioned being disrespected by their peers which leads me to believe that you think that children are encouraged by other children to suffer in silence, not that you necessarily say that teachers and parents encourage that course of action.    If a child is truly getting BULLIED, then chances are that other children are getting bullied by the same child.  They are probably afraid of going to an adult because they believe that bully will punish them for doing so.  Unfortunately its a vicious cycle. Bullies operate by instilling fear.  If a child is afraid of a bully, then the child won't reveal what is happening.  Adults and teachers may argue that if they knew about it, they could stop it, or prevent it from continuing.  The problem is that children know that teachers and parents aren't always around.  In fact, the bullying probably only happens when adults aren't around- so the promise of protection from adults is pretty much worthless. In fact, many children probably feel that they are safer by not saying anything than by saying something.  If they don't say anything they are just one of 10 or more kids that get bullied and since the bully has so many people to focus his/her attention on, they sometimes are left alone.  If the do tell, however, they will become the bully's primary object of terror, therefore making it worse for the poor kid that did the right thing.    If the kid is not actually scared of the child that is being mean, then they are probably not truly being bullied- they are probably just being picked on just like every kid is picked on at some point in there life.  Honestly, kids need that in school.  If they never get picked on in school, then when they get to the real world and their employers come in and are brutally honest about everything they did wrong, and they don't know how to handle it.    However, I agree with those that answered before me, if a student ever asks a teacher "what should I do if someone is bullying me?" They will all say "well you need to let me know right away"|`|HSsqa0Vgaa	They should have their parents pay someone to beat the sh*t out of the bully.  Break his bloody face!
U7sBZKUuaa	My biological father died in a car wreck when I was but 6 months old. A kid I went to school with was electrocuted at a power relay station where he was laying a concrete foundation for something. My mother's last husband was lured out of his car and beaten to death with a tire iron and stuffed in his own trunk by a crazed security guard. Yep, I've known a few. It is a harder way to take it. When a person is sick or old and they die it is expected and sometimes a relief that they are finally at peace, but all of these were too young and their death really caught us with our pants down.|`|ivGzzGOdaa	my friend died of drug overdose about a month ago. my sister died in her sleep at age of 51,they think it was a heart attack. that was 2 months ago. my friend only drank and smoked pot.but went wild on cocaine and methadone for about a month before it took him out. my sisters death was a shock,because she showed no signs of sickness.
MqQtb8Dfaa	to the people who think you should ban something that doesnt directly affect you, who made you king. If we're sittin down smoking a joint we arent bothering you we're having a good time, YOU shouldnt have anything to do with it, mind your own business? Not like we're running up to you and stabbing you in the face with a knife.People think drugs are bad because theyre afraid of something people have been telling them is wrong their whole lives, and theyve been told that by the government, what a surprise? there are no rules in this world except for those you choose to accept and live by, thats my motto. i dont believe anyone has the right to tell you what you can or cannot do as long as youre not harming somebody else.    For those saying oh well you're hurting yourself, look at all the obese people in the world, they die off everyday from that, and drawing from the bike example, you have fun on a bike dont you? You can kill yourself on a bike. People do things everyday that are harmful to themselves but which is not illegal, drugs just happen to make you happier and give you time to relax sit down and think and realize there is more to life than workin 9-5 and payin taxes everyday.|`|DBIgAIBZaa	They are addicting and dangerous.

il7bLkSIaa	first of all...I dont know why you said "sorry for the bad english", because your english was perfect    and second of all, since you said that...I assume you might have an accent, and you probably dont realize it, but your insecurity from your accent causes you to speak quietly.    Just talk a little louder and clearer! Who cares what people say or think, they will get used to it. It will also be good because everyone will understand you better|`|KHVvDMLYaa	you cant make your voice higher. unless you swallow helium or something...  by the way your english was perfect  as for the voice, people in my class have that problem. its not weird or anything. just speak clearly. dont speak loudly. it only makes it weird. and what race are you? ( just out of curiousity )  hope i helped :)|`|NaNplX1naa	Don't worry that happens at your age. you have entered changing period of your life. so you are emotional conscious and scared about so many things. your voice must be changing too. play cool. you can go to open place imagine some one at a distance place and try to shout and talk to him. try to shout from your stomach with total force and when you are actually with many people think that there is no one but your imaginary friend and shout similarly.  they will laugh as they will get good surprise but you will be able to catch their attention in positive way.  that is how i had learnt when i was in N.C.C. officer and command big crowd on the ground.
gnABxaKmaa	I would use the Approximate Theory to try to answer your question... Approimate Theory is an abstract theory which puts forth approximations for inaccurate events...    Surely your kids can't be exactly full White... but 3/4 white... but by your description, all five of your kids look White... So by the Approximate Method, your kids ARE (approximately) White.    I know this would be slightly hard for you... but you should try to teach them the heritage that they deserve (since it is decided that they're White)... From history to heritage, culture and identity, you should allow them to have full access to the information. Tell them that they are 1/4 Black and if they want to know about their Black heritage, give it to them. If they don't (for whatever reason), don't force it on them and just accept them as White. If they choose the embrace the White Race, don't stop them (as long as no violence is involved).     To be really technical, your kids (nor grandkids) will even be full White... the Approx. Method stablises your identity but if you look REALLY closely... you'll see that some European traits have disappeared in your children (from rosy-faced to the shape of the skull etc.)... It doesn't matter! Just note that at least they look White enough to belong somewhere...    To sweetgirl: Thank you for the photo... If you look closely, the girl has a flat-nose (African trait)... If we go by specific terms, the girl is obviously not full White... But by Approximate Method, she IS (approximately) White.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	no i am not jellous lmao, genetics are crazy, my bf has blue eyes and dirty blonde hair, chances are since the fathers genes are stronger my kids features would look more like him.

UhyvM73iaa	When Moses got freedom to 600.000 Jew from Pharoh and took them out of Egypt to desert Sini,  they stopped by the Mount Sini because Moses received call from God to come on the mountain. God kept Moses with Him on mount Sini for 40 days, for his spiritual training.  Meanwhile in the absence of Moses, Jews made a calf god and started worshipping it  and abundoned the worship of God almighty.  God ordered Moses to command all chiefs of twelve tribes of jews to execute all men and women who worshipped idol of calf god and committed apostasy.  On the command of God tribal chiefs executed 60,000 jews that day. God had commanded to Moses in strong words that if chiefs of twelve tribes will ignore and not enforce my command,  I shall destroy all 600,000 Jews in this desert.     God did not ammend nor cancelled the excution of apostates  in Quran. When Prophet Mohammad SAW  faced the same situation in Madina, he had to follow the law given by God in previous Book of God Torah revealed to Moses.  Because Prophet Mohammad enforced the law of Torah and executed one or two Muslim apostates who turned as Idolators.  God's no comment on Prophet's action, became a  confirmation  that God wanted  law in Torah enforced  by Muslims   also.  Because of the precedent of Prophet Mohammad, this law became permanent law in Islamic Shariah also.  When a Muslim  starts worshipping any one else other than God, then he becomes apostate. Then Islamic Shariah Law will execute this person if he is living in a Muslim country.  .     Apostates are safe from execution as long as they are not living in a Muslim country.  Muslim countries do not try to extradite them back to his home country for the purpose of his execution.   Most non-Muslim countries do not have any law against apostates. Therefore apostates are safe in non-Muslim countries.    Apostatsy by Muslims is rare.  Most Muslims do not change their religion. The concept of oneness of God the creator of heavens, the provider, the protector of all living creatures on earth is very powerful concept in Islam and worshipping other than God almighty is a great sin in Islamic Shariah. In the eyes of Muslims worship of man-made idols like Hindus, Christians, Catholics and Budhists do is considered an insult of God and great sin that Allah never forgives unless a person accept Islam and repent God to forgive for his past sins. Allah does forgive those who accept Islam and never go back to their previous religions.      Few statements of Allah - the God almighty in  Quran for you to read:    "This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion". (Soorah Al-Maa'idah 5:3)    "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah (God) never will It be accepted of Him" (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:85)    "Abraham was not a Jew nor Christian; but an upright Muslim." (Soorah Aal'imraan 3:67)    May Allah - God allmighty  guide us all to the right path of Islam, forgive our sins and grant us haven in hereafter.|`|XTUg4Uk8aa	some of these answers are really frightening like their is no compulsion to religion however if you cause mischief which means if you speak out against this religion you face the death penalty. barbaric or what and they want sharia law in western countries this must never be allowed to happen|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Well they would be killed by ppl like Sabr, most muslims would not care though.

It means you have to see the text in 'context' i.e. who is the author, what is his Profile, what school of thought he belonged to, what other contemporary authors have written about this, what was the actual situation when this event happened, etc.  If we refer to the early history, the muslims had accommodated non muslims in the key positions and there have been prominent display of cultural tolerance and pluralism in all way of life. Look at the history of Fatimid dynasty where such tolerance was inculcated.     The religion is an individual affair between man and God.  I am not sure about such threats but Islam in its true sense, is the religion of peace and tolerance.|`|c87B8GySaa	Why do you care?

So I held it and waited to the next class well by than it was so bad I was dancing down the halls with my hands on my crouch desperately trying to make to the bathroom. than this huge group of thugs came by and saw me and than it happened I could feel the piss filling my pants. It was so bad I didn't go back to class after wards|`|AA11139157	just recently i went to my college with my best friend. and there is this huge staircase right in front of the front door at the school once you go inside. i was talking to my best friend and she started to walk up the stairs and i have no clue how this happened but as i walked behind her talking with her, i wasn't paying attention adn i tripped, and fell forward (instead of backwayds which i found kinda wierd) nevertheless, i made a huge noise in the process and caught everyone's attention in the school- i was so embaresed but me and my best friend just laughed it out right afterwards.

Being free of clutter seems to help me, just start small and get that dirty room cleaned and maybe freshened with a new bedspread or accessories or artwork.

Being outdoors is usually refreshing (I guess it can depend on where you live).  If you can take a walk even for five or ten minutes each day, to break up your routine or create a new routine-- I bet that would improve your mood.  If you don't want to walk for no reason, try to create a chore that you have to do and involve walking.  Like walk to a mailbox a few blocks over to mail something.  Force yourself to do it!    You already seem to know why you feel unfresh and not alive.  Change your diet, even if it's just a little bit.  I know I feel a lot better immediately if I choose to eat a yogurt instead of a bagel.  You don't have to make huge changes or anything, start off small.

You might want to find out if the synagogue in question is offering "Introduction to Judaism" classes - many do.      Reading is important.  I'd suggest "Basic Judaism" by Rabbi Milton Steinberg, "Every Person's Guide to Judaism" by Lydia Kukoff and Stephen J. Einstein, and "Choosing a Jewish Life" by Anita Diamant.    When the time is right for you, call the synagogue office and make an appointment to talk with the rabbi (they tend to be REALLY busy people).  He/she can give you more information about the conversion process they follow; each rabbi of any branch of Judaism has slight variations, as you might expect.      I converted to Judaism in 1996, and it was one of the best things I ever did!    Shalom :-)|`|4BQXYxPYaa	You start where you have started.

Love Kent.|`|Rl1Qqcqzaa	As Ruth pointed out, DO NOT get mixed up with any group that uses the term "messianic" in conjunction with Jews or Judaism.  They are NOT Jewish.    "Messianic Jews" instead are a bizarre Christian cult who refuse to acknowledge that they are Christians and instead insist they are Jews.  They do things outwardly that may appear to be Jewish to someone who does not know better but their beliefs are totally incompatible with and contrary to the beliefs found in Judaism.  Instead of following the tenants of Judaism, they (1) worship Jesus, (2) believe in virgin birth, (3) believe that sins are atoned by human sacrifice, (4) believe in the divinity of Jesus, (5) believe that Jesus was the son of God, (6) read, study, and follow the New Testament, etc., etc., etc--all these things and much more that they do and believe in are Christian and, as should be obvious to anyone who knows anything about Judaism, none of these things are Jewish. Therefore, calling themselves Jews as they do is nothing but FRAUDULENT, DECEPTIVE, and DESPICABLE. It is sickening and pathetic how they insert THEIR Christianity into all of OUR holidays and holy days and claim the result is Judaism. What they are doing as far as Judaism is concerned is nothing less than blasphemy.    No Jew on earth accepts them as being any part of our religion in any way. They should be denounced by everyone who stands up for righteousness and honor and truthfulness--not of course because they believe in Jesus--but instead because they make a mockery of Judaism by claiming Judaism is something other than what it is. No Jew worships anyone other than one God, a God who did not have a son sent to earth, born to a virgin, died on the cross, rose again, etc. etc. etc as is believed by Christians. Period. The Christian New Testament is NOT part of our bible. Period.    To get some example of how bizarre they really are consider this: Can one deny Jesus, say he never even existed, and still be a Christian? Of course not, and the same reasoning applies to these so-called "messianic Jews"--one can not believe in Jesus and be Jewish simultaneously. Christians who feel the need to take up what they think is a Jewish lifestyle without letting go of their Christian beliefs really need to come up with another name for themselves rather than misappropriate ours. They, including their fraudulent "messianic rabbis" are living a lie by calling themselves Jews. All sane, rational people, no matter what their religion happens to be, know these people are NOT Jews (except for the "messianic Jews" themselves).|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: you're not lost, my friend.  Talk with the rabbi at the synagogue.  He'll let you know if they have an "Intro to Judaism" class beginning soon.  He'll also likely have a suggested reading list that will help.    keep going to Friday night and Saturday services. Hit the various websites, get some books and start learning as much as you can.    http://www.jewfaq.org/index.htm    that is a good starting website.  Very informative and interesting read.    Books to start: The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Judaism by a Rabbi (it's a real book)    Choosing a Jewish Life    The Jewish Home    and avoid anything with the term "Messianic" attached to it or those telling you to believe in Yeshua (or other spellings) - that's not Judaism, it's a Christian sect.             Again - someone is attempting to mislead you with "Messianics" - they aren't Jewish, they aren't part of Judaism and aren't accepted by Jews or by GOOD Christians.
UhyvM73iaa	Bible is different because original words given to Jesus were lost. What you have is stories about Jesus. what he did and said by others.  Lots of changes have been made in Bible and continue making changes. It has  lots of contradictions because most of the words are not from God but words of those who wrote several books written by different persons. Bible is compilation of books of others and not Jesus nor God Himself.     Jesus was Jew and he preached Jewish Laws and commands of God in Torah.  He did not receive any new law and je himself followed the laws in Torah.  Jesus received only wisdom from God how to enforce   Laws of Torah.  When a woman was about to be stoned to death, Jesus came and said, only those who never sinned can only stone to the woman. All Jewish men dropped their stones.  Christians are wrong who say Jesus cancelled stoning to death to prostitutes and   adulterers by pardoning the woman.   Jesus had no authority to change laws of God in Torah nor he could make new law by himself.   He simply meant that society must help all women get married, provide them husbands to feed and cloth them, establish justice in society  and after that if a woman commits adultery then only pious people should stone her to death by laws in Torah. If she becomes prostitute because no one married her being a girl of a poor family and she becomes prostitute to feed herself, then entire society is sinful for not providing her a husband. Then they have no right to punish her.   That is what Jesus meant to do by saving her.  Then woman immediately accept Jesus as her savior and remained her believer rest of her life. Only real men of God have such power in their words and actions.  You are the first one who say Bible and Quran are different.  Most Christians keep saying Mohammad copied Quran from Bible though they never read neither Bible nor Quran. They only repeat the words that their Christian preacher tell them against Quran and Prophet Mohammad.     Both books are different because Allah God Almighty revealed to two different men, in different times, under different situations. Bible was given to Jews only. Jesus said to his apostles go only to lost sheep of Jews and do not go to gentiles.  They already worshipped one God.  Quran was sent for people who worshipped many man made idol gods, they had no limit of wives, they treated women as property. When a man would die, his eldest or the powerful son will own all his father's wives as his wives except his mother whom he was born to. It was a very cruel society to orphans, widows and poor people. Rich exploited all weak people. They had no laws and no central government.  They only followed their traditions and customs made by their people.  Each man and woman was protected by their tribes. Without the protection of a tribe one could not survive a weak. Others would grab them and sell them in market as slaves. When one person murdered a man of another tribe, they had wars between the tribes for 50 to 100 years.    Muslims scholars say that God kept Arabs of Arabian peninsula,   ignorant, unlettered, ruthless, lawless, ungoverned by any laws and never sent any Prophet for their guidance after Prophet Ishmael the first born son of Prophet Abraham from his Arab wife Hagar. Nothing gew in this peninsula. For this reason no foreign powers like Romans and Persians ever entered in peninsula to occupy it. They knew Arabs can not be ruled by any power..  Arabs remained untouched and   uncorrupted by any civilization.  They didn't know politics, philosophy or civic life. Only thing they knew was how to fight with sword, arrows and javelins.  Muslim Scholars believe God kept them  fighting amongst themselves for over 3000 years to prepare them to use for spreading Islam after becoming followers of Mohammad SAW. God gave Prophet Mohammad SAW such a charismatic personality that no other man ever received the characteristics and personality he had.  Michael Hart an American author of his book "100 Most Influenccial men of Human History"  picked Mohammad as   1  Most influence man in the history of mankind. You should find this book in a large size library.   God knew no any other people would have give their blood for Islam like Arabs did once they take oath of allegiance to Prophet Mohammad and  accepted Islam.  In wars they surrounded their Prophet and received arrows of enemies on their backs to protect his life.  They strongly believed in the words of God in Quran that if they die fighting for Islam, they enter heaven right after their soul is out of their bodies. Every one of them wished to die fighting for God.    You know companions of Jesus disappeard in crowd when Romans    arrested Jesus and were taking him to crucify beating and humiliating him but did not give their life to save him.  One companion took money from Jewish Rabi and betrayed Jesus by letting soldiers know where he was hiding. They did because of their mental corruption by society they were rais|`|9dkONba4aa	The Bible and the Koran are not different.Chapter 1 of the Koran says God is love but uses the word compassionate instead. Chapter 3 of the Koran is about the family of Jesus.Chapter 4 of the Koran is about women.  That is similar to where it talks of women in the New Testament. It talks about Eve the  wife of Adam,inheritance, hell, divorce, ex-wives, marriage, incest, how suicide is forbidden, about worshiping God and not putting other gods before him, about loving your neighbor("be good to parents,and to kindred, and to orphans, and to the poor, and to a neighbor,whether kinsmen or a newcomer, and to a fellow traveler, and to the wayfarer, and to the servants or employees who your right hands hold.....",about Pharisee like people,about Abraham, about Satan, about those who try to tempt you to sin, about not bearing false witness against your neighbor, about the Bible(the Book), about usury, about the Jews,Noah, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Solomon, Job, Jesus, Jonah, David, the tribes, Aaron, the book of Psalms. Chapter 5 is about Cain, not eating pork or things strangled, about germs and cleanliness, the covenant of the children of Israel, that thou shalt not murder, about the Torah, the 10 commandments, John the Baptist (the Evangel), evil doers(sinners), about Nebacanezzar(wild ape), swine(do not throw pearls before swine), against alcohol, fortunetelling, and gambling. Chapter 6 is about Elisha, Lot, not worshipping the sun or moon, Zachariah, not to eat anything that dies of itself or blood or swines flesh(pork),Moses, He has no associates( no one sits on the right hand of God-OT), against homosexuality("...come you to men instead of women lustfully, you are indeed people given up to excess") (thou shalt not commit adultery), forgiveness and mercy. Chapter 44 is about"But the pious(righteous) shall be in a secure place, amid gardens and fountains, clothed in silk and richest robes(linen), facing one another; Thus shall it be and we (God) will WED( the marriage feast of Revelation or Apocalyse) them to the virgins( women saints) with large dark eyes(this is for Middle Eastern audience); therein shall they call, secure, for every kind of fruit; Therein their first death passed, shall they taste death no more; and He shall keep them from the pains of Hell;....")  Revelation puts it this way,"..for the marriage of the Lamb (Jesus) is come and his wife( many members) had made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the righteous of Saints(Rev. 19:7-8)."And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;  and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there  be any more pain; for the former things are passed away." (Revelation 21:4) "And in the midst of the of the street of it, and of either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month;...."(Revelation 22;2)  Etc, etc. See the Koran has the Bible in it.It is just arranged in a different order.|`|AA11379158	The bible's been tampered with; you should know that.|`|syMxQEF3aa	Because the bible has been edited and newer more 'modern versions' are being made using the latest vernacular. Before we know it every other word in the bible will be 'like' and 'Omg'.    The quran is the word of Allah (swt) and it is not comparable to the best writers and orators in all of history.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Because the Holy Bible is the word of the true God.  I agree with djmantx the god talked about in the Quran is not the God of Abraham.  In the Holy Bible the Jews are Gods chosen whereas in the Quran they are not and at the end of the age doesn't it say all Jews will be destroyed?    The god talked about in the Quran wants a lot of works and prayers before he would consider letting somebody in Heaven, and even after lots of prayers and works that person could still end up in hell for a while.  The true God of the Bible gave us a simple way to salvation which is through Jesus Christ.  God came to earth in bodily form (Jesus Christ) to take our punishment for our sins for us so we can have forgiveness and eternal life and never ever see hell!  Therefore we are under grace not law.  Man cannot work his way to Heaven.      Romans 3:23-25- "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.  God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood"    Romans 4:6- "David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works"     However many non-Christians seem to think we have this attitude that we can sin all we like and that is really not the case!    John 14:15- "If you love me, you will obey what i command"    Romans 6:1-2- "What shall we say then? shall we go on sinning, so that grace may increase?.  By no means! We died to sin: how can we live in it any longer?"    Also in the Quran doesn't it say allah misleads all non-Muslims deliberately and wants to use us to populate hell for him? how nice of him!     Also in the Holy Bible God hates all sin but loves the sinner.  But in the Quran doesn't allah even deliberately cause non-Muslims to sin?|`|dnA6sAFqaa	Because they are written from different religious perspectives and cultures. I am always fascinated by the similarities rather than the differences because it shows that stories and legends in the ancient near east were similar and appear in different sources as well as in various religious writings. Both are written to show God's revelation to his people. The Bible is written from the judaeo-christian persepctive and the Koran is written from the arabic/muslim perspective.    Both claim that their followers are the children of Abraham. This is often interesting when we are involved in interfaith dialogues because it is a good starting point.|`|d1i3ac5baa	neither the bible or the torah says kill all non-believers in allah and mo. so it's easy to see if a book has been corrupted it has to be the quran.|`|AA11648578	Fajr, they are different because Allah is not the God of Abraham.  All prophet are required to be ina agreement with the prophets and the word of God even angels have ot be tested with the word of God.  Muhammad did not know the word of God and apparently claims he received revelation from a spirit he could not prove was form God that disagreed with God but does agree with the serpent in the garden which is Satan..  The Islamic answer is Gods word is corrupt..    The obvious problem is if the word of God was corrupt there is no way for Muhammad to know where this spirit he was talking to was from.  The other problem is Muhammad could not be tested by the word of God which means he could not be a prophet of God.    If the word of God became corrupt..then the only way to know anything form God would be God actually speaks his word to us...God is smart enough to know if his word could not be trusted then he could not simply send another written word delivered by a spirit that could not be trusted or tested ..He would neccesarly have to speak his word.    There are a million problems with the Qu'ran..in that it does not agree with God and unfortunately agrees with Satan while claiming to be in agreement with the prophets of God..and all you have to do is read the books of the prophets to know what Allah did not know that this revelation is not in agreement with the prophets nor with the word of God.    Edit...These are fantastic questions..everyone should ask these questions. All  Christians and Muslims should ask God for the answer to these questions...I am pleased that you are seeking the truth to this point..fantastic. I have found rather than ask these questions of God many will reject him.  Those who love God will seek God for a deeper understanding.|`|XTUg4Uk8aa	because the bible is the word of God and the koran is the word of a false prophet. prepare ye the way of the Lord and make his path straight.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Different target audiences. If God exists, he obviously created a very diverse population of cultures, and naturally they would all have different needs. Arab cultures adopted the Quran to serve their spiritual needs. Western cultures adopted the Bible. The similarities will typically represent the more universal aspects of the texts. The differences will represent cultural differences and alternative contexts.    p.s. I am a Christian, and I do not consider Islam to be a cult. That is just plain silly. It is just a different religion for different people. Sorry for the sermon, though. I just hate being stereotyped!

If they do not acknowledge Jesus as God's son it's considered a cult.|`|U5zcbHuZaa	Please read Qur'an 5:48, which explains Allah sent Qur'an confirming the scripture that came before it and guarding that scripture, "so judge between them by what Allah has revealed," which means Qur'an is to be part of the guide for finding where the corruptions are in those scriptures, and further the verse goes on to explain it is a test for us.    Note that the verse does not say that the Qur'an replaces the prior scriptures nor that the prior scriptures are worthless, but rather it instructs Muslims to discern the truth from falsehood within those scriptures and to use Qur'an as a guide.|`|5PAfTUfIaa	simple. the bible was changed and the quran was not.....|`|c87B8GySaa	The has been one message from Allah TaAlaa.  The Taurut and the Injeel were books of Tauhid.  The Jews allowed their Rabbis to twist the Taurut,and turn it  into a tribal thing,full of terrible stories such as yakoob wrestling with Allah,  Subhannah Allah! And Nuh getting drunk.  The followers of Prophet Isa peace on him,chose to discard his Injeel and follow the teachings of Paul,who taught a confused mix of Rabbinical Judaism,and pagan sun god cult.    Allah TaAlaa sent the Quran as a mercy to mankind,confirming all that was sent before.  So it is the followers of the Bible who have twisted it to suit their desire.  In America for example the heart of the Christian Religion is little more than nationalism and right wing politics.|`|ZJ6Nwbv3aa	They had their time and now its your time.|`|AA10281572	Sorry to everybody that this offends:    The answer is obvious: they can't possibly both be his revelation can they?  Would God who gave man reason possibly say on the one hand to love your neighbor and on the say kill your neighbor and take his wives if he will not convert?  Now for some historical background just for information sake:    The Pentateuch and Torah predate both books (although they are included in the Bible as the Old Testament) and were written by the Jewish people.  Israel was conquered several times back and forth from their many neighbors including Egypt, Macedon (Greece), Babylon, and Rome.  When Babylon conquered them many Israelites ended up in what is modern day Turkey-Iraq-Iran as laborers and as government officials as was common.    Eventually king Nebuchadnezzar became a follower of the Jewish faith.  He did away with quite a bit of idol worship at his conversion, including worship of the moon god: Allah.  Allah was said to have no sons but many daughters (the stars).  This is all relevant... stick with me...    Eventually the Babylonians were conquered by Persians, and Persians were decimated by Alexander the Great from Macedonia, he died and his empire was divided amongst his family and generals.  So now the area fell under the reign of the Seleucids... well they were defeated by the Romans and so on and so forth.    Eventually Mohammad went into one of the old temples where they were storing the idols of hundreds of gods he decided to pick one, and it happened to be Allah.  This is why Islam's symbol is the moon and why it is said that Allah had no sons (because he had daughters), which is often used to refute the claim that Jesus of Nazareth was the son of God.  Christ is then viewed as a slave and prophet.  The Torah and Pentateuch still remained for the most part as very influential, this is where you find aversion to pork and other similar things.    Unfortunately, this means the Quran is mostly made up, it doesn't stand up well to the tests one would give to check the authenticity of claims (such as did the author have something to gain by writing, be it sexual, monetary, influence, etc).  The only claim to validity we have is that Mohamed conquered the middle east... but many have conquered far larger swaths of land in the name of other gods but we don't worship Zeus, Pluto, or Thor.    The Bible holds up far better to these types of scrutiny, as all the witnesses to the events would rather die than recant their testimonies, and many did.  Unfortunately, the followers of the way as they were called then had many pagan practices introduced when Constantine converted (although whether he indeed converted is still debated as he was known to worship a sun god, which is reportedly why he introduced the stained glass window).    There's scores of historical information out there to find out more about these things.  Whatever you do, analyze the books in their historical context and analyze their validity because as you said the two books claim to be God's revelation but are so different.|`|DYdXrVVeaa	No - they claim to be revelations of god|`|LEO8nRzkaa	Different takes the message.|`|1E7gqGBGaa	Muhammad thought that they had perverted to true message so he made some changes to suit his agenda.|`|6e9wMh6yaa	The Bible wasn't written by God.

I agree with Bella, the only way to Paradise is through belief in Jesus... as he was a noble messenger of Allah.  One must believe in All of the messengers of Allah or they will not attain paradise.  This would include belief in Adam, Ibrahim, Musa, Dawud, Sulaimon, Isa (Jesus), Muhammad , etc. Peace be upon them all.  Allah knows best!

Pre-marital sex is severe sin in Islam. Single fornicators get  100 lashes in public and  married adulterers are stoned to death in Islamic Shariah laws. .      God revealed these two punishments for adulterers and apostates in Torah to Prohet Moses. Because God neither ammended nor cancelled these two laws in Quran, therefore Prophet Mohammad had to enforce the same laws from Torah on Muslim apostates and adulterers. Because of his two precedents these two laws from Torah became permanent parts of  Islamic Shariah laws to be enforced in all Muslim countries.      Most non-Muslims keep asking that  there is no punishment of stoning to death for married adulterers and execution of apostate is written in Quran, then why Muslim countries give these severe punishments.   I have answered  same questions many times but always a new Asker asks the same questions again.|`|bdbc8a2d0b1f77a1844f252b2c6a4b41aa	yeah, it is important, marriage is half the religion.|`|03Xx7l8Baa	Bismillah,  Very serious and good question, alhamdulellah. Allah yejazeeki khier.    The importance of Marriage in Islam,  is equivilant to the importance of half yourself. Consider, Chapter 4, al-nisa', is the third largest chapter in the Quran and dedicated to women and the main theme is the building of a strong islamic community. The nucleus of a strong community is without a doubt a stable family structure. The fact that Allah informs us about the issue of women in the first one-fifth of the surah is enough emphasis on how the woman herself is that very center of the family structure which in turn makes the community strong and stable.    -- To answer briefly, no. There is no punishment by Allah (SWT) mentioned regarding refraining from marriage. But look at this verse:  And Allah has made for you mates (and companions) of your own nature, and made for you, out of them, sons and daughters and grandchildren, and provided for you sustenance of the best: will they then believe in vain things, and be ungrateful for Allah's favours? (al-Nahl 16: 72)   - So one can take from this, that it shows ungratitude to take for granted what Allah has created for a purpose. Should we not be grateful to our Creater?    -- Regarding whether or not it's compulsory or free choice, then simply it is a choice, just like everything else you do. There are things to chose from that will gain reward wtihout punishment (like marriage or other sunnahs), and things that you can chose to do that will give you rewards and a punishment if not done (any of the five pillars of Islam).     -- and last how important is it for women in Islam to marry? Vital.     Now if you have more time to read, inshaAllah;  * It is Important to note or to clarify that the main point of celibacy is to refrain from any sexual activity IN order to focus more on religion. That is why the nuns and priests follow this and instead stay in the abby or churches and spend their entire time in worship.    -now we know the hadith,  the Prophet (pbuh) said: "When a man marries, he indeed perfects half of his religion then he should fear Allah for the remaining half".  and he (peace and blessings be upon him) also said: Nikah (marriage) is my Sunna. He who shuns my Sunna is not of me.  ...so to practice celibacy is contradictory in the face of Islam...   --> however,  There are categories for people in terms of who should and should not get married. If someone knows that they cannot fulfill the obligations of marriage and will not give their spouse their rights, then it is actually haram for them to get married.    If you fear marriage or there is a reason you wish to DELAY it, then that is ANOTHER story. But to resort to celibacy is going too extreme.  -->The Prophet said, "A widow or divorced woman should not be given in marriage except after consulting her; and a virgin should not be given in marriage except after her permission." you do have a say or choice in whom you marry, and it's your responsiblity to seek information on what to look for in a good husband.    * I highly suggest though, to reconsider marriage for the blessings that Allah places within it are a sign from Allah,  - "And among His signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves that you may dwell in tranquillity with them and He has put love and mercy between your hearts: verily in that are signs for those who reflect." (Surah Al Rum 30:21)     - the Prophet (pbuh) said: "A man marries a woman for four reasons: for her property, for her rank, for her beauty, and for her religion (and character). So marry the one who is best in the religion and character and prosper".    - Among my followers the best of men are those who are best to their wives, and the best of women are those who are best to their husbands. To each of such women is set down a reward equivalent to the reward of a thousand martyrs. Among my followers, again, the best of women are those who assist their husbands in their work, and love them dearly for everything, save what is transgression of Allah's laws.'    And remember, The Prophet (pbuh) said, "None honours women except he who is honourable, and none despises them except he who is despicable."  ++++Finally++++  I would HIGHLY recommend these for further reading;    http://www.ediscoverislam.com/About-Isla...  http://www.beautifulislam.net/family/mot...   http://www.beautifulislam.net/women/rewa...  http://www.jannah.org/sisters/marr.html  http://www.beautifulislam.net/marriage/a...|`|zBqt99avaa	Pathan has answered this pretty well.  I would only add that while it's not compulsory and there is no punishment for not marrying, it leaves you more at risk for sin.  Sexual urges, as a biological necessity, are strong and continue increase (for women, especially) with age from puberty to around 40-45 years of age.  So while you may be strong now, in your youth, over the years, a person's willpower may degrade.    Now I'm not saying people can't stay without it, but as difficult as it is in your youth, it is much more difficult into adulthood.  You can see people in relationships now and dismiss them as temporary and bad for them, but as an adult, you will see many married and happy couples, and you will most likely crave that closeness.  But by that age, it may well be too late to find the right person.    Unless a person has a permanent reason not to marry (I don't mean you, but if someone was gay, or perhaps unable to conceive, which I don't agree they shouldn't marry over, but some people would), I would leave yourself open to the possibility.  I was convinced I would never marry until I met Mustafa, and now I can't wait to be his wife (no, really, it's driving me crazy! lol)    take care.|`|ZJ6Nwbv3aa	you can fly in space like ankaboot..... alone!|`|MAAxboH7aa	Marriage is very important in Islam. Sex, or even touching is forbidden before there is a marriage bond tying the male and female together. Pre-marital sex is completely out of the question. The man who commits adultery would be punished severely by being impaled. The woman will be stoned to death. Before marriage the man can only see his future bride's face and hands. I reckon it is enough as my parents were met this way and are still very much in love and married 22 years later :).

These works correspond to the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), with some variations and additions. In the Eastern Orthodox Church the comparable texts are known as the Septuagint, from the original Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures. The term "Old Testament" itself is credited to Melito of Sardis.[1]    Tertullian also used the Latin vetus testamentum in the second century. It is sometimes called the First Testament.[2]    Most scholars agree that the Hebrew Bible was composed and compiled between the 12th and the 2nd century BC,[3] before Jesus' birth. Jesus and his disciples referenced it when discussing Jesus's newer teachings, referring to it as "the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms ... the scriptures".

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

God bless.|`|zHle6Paqaa	The New Covenant is:  Essentially the same as New Testament, but with several distinct connotations. It is a sacred agreement instituted by God in the person of Christ. It is a completion of the Old Covenant that Yahweh made with the Jews. It is an eternal covenant whose fulfillment is destined for heaven. It is a promise on God's part to confer the blessings foretold in the Sermon on the Mount and at the Last Supper, provided the followers of Christ are faithful in their generosity toward God.

God lead the unclean on there, a male and female, therefore they would procreate. God lead the clean animals on there by 7s. The clean animals were to establish the right to eat clean animals, though human life span would be shortened, there was likely little vegetation on the ark (they were on there a total of 377 days, over a year) so God permitted the eating of the clean. Therefore, currently, we are to glorify God in our bodies not eating the unclean, however, as many would like to preserve their temples (the body) even further, we choose to go to the original diet given to man and woman, being vegetarian again!     There won't be any meat eating in heaven, or in the New Earth, so many choose to make preparation for that as they desire to be like Christ in character as well!
AyEkA6Flaa	Dr. Francis Collins, who headed the Human Genome Project, confirmed to me by email that sexual orientation likely is caused by a combination of genetic and hormonal events in the womb.  We are born wired to be gay, just as we are born wired to be left-handed.    I have always loved other boys.  In a frantic attempt to become straight, I even married a woman and had kids, but that threw me into clinical depression from the constant denial and stuffing down of my true affections.  My wife divorced me, which shook my world and forced me to come to grips with my sexuality.  Well...I am still gay.  It is who I am, who I always have been.    When I was in third grade, I thought the boy in the next row was the most beautiful person I had ever seen.    In fourth grade, when our teacher showed us the old 1968 Franco Zefirelli version of "Romeo and Juliet", not knowing it had a nude scene, while the other boys were ogling Juliet's breasts, I had fallen in love with Romeo's face and my breath was taken away to see his nude backside.    Hahaha, I even had a crush on "Davy" of the Monkees when I was maybe seven years old.    Believe me, we are born gay.  And it is not a "defect" in the brain -- it is a "gift" in the brain!|`|sgRJRuvgaa	I believe that homosexuality like everyother is a result of opinion. Opinion is both triggered and untriggered. So gay people have the opinion that the same sex is more sexually apealing which is an untriggered opinion. Just like we have our taste buds and different sents. We all smell and taste the same thing just as we all see men and women, but we all like to eat, smell, and look at different things|`|oVeGMNsLaa	It is my belief that it is a mixture of nature and environment.  There are genetic components to sexual orientation.  There are also parts of sexual orientation that defy a genetic origin.    But what I can most tell you is that nobody can consciously choose their sexuality.  People can choose to act on it, but certainly nobody can one day wake up and say "Hey, I think I'll be straight/gay/lesbian/whatever!"    Oh, and scientists researching the causes of sexuality to better understand it is a lot different than saying that it's a defect (which nobody in the scientific community is).|`|NwXnzARwaa	Gay people do not choose to be gay.    Discover Magazine has shown that "Two of the most convincing studies have proved conclusively that sexual orientation in men has a genetic cause."    New Scientist has shown that "geneticists may have explained how genes apparently linked to male homosexuality survive" and "Mothers' genetic skew linked to gay sons."    LiveScience has shown that "The arrangement of a mother's genes could affect the sexual orientation of her son, according to a new study."    Scientific American has shown that "Having Older Brothers Increases a Man's Odds of Being Gay."    WebMD has shown that magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal key differences in the brains of gay and straight men and women that could add to the understanding of the biology of homosexuality.|`|6YPVVsbwaa	yes, i've always been gay, i'm proud . lol|`|QJT5JXf2aa	I'm bisexual and people who support gay and lesbians, even gay and lesbian people themselves, have tried to tell me that I was not born this way and that it was my choice.    I completely disagree.    I have always loved girls the same way I loved boys. I didn't understand it as a child, and didn't really understand what being bisexual was until I got older, but I always was sexually attracted to girls as much, if not more than boys, and even wanted to marry my best friend in first grade.     I was born this way and the only choice in my life has been to make myself miserable by pretending I don't love women or to be myself and be happy with who I was born to be: a proud, open bisexual gal.|`|muHctmaGaa	One of the problems with the nurture debate is that it always seems as if we have more control over ourselves than we actually do. Like, I might choose to be more outgoing if I could bring myself to smile at and talk to people, without really understanding how painfully introverted I am.    The fact that animals are not conditioned and show a range of same-sex activity from intercourse to pair-bonding strongly argues in favor of natural origins. Nuture cases are probably bisexuals who identify with one side of their attraction more than the other. I agree with the discouraged kid in your class; I don't think our brains are any more involved than in determining left-handedness. How exactly would we be hardwired for heterosexuality?|`|MvmuZMG4aa	you know what i just realized? that there are one or two questions like this everyday...... asking if homosexuality is a choice or not.... and i also have a feeling its the same people answering this kind of question  everyday lol|`|HHRrlqhwaa	I am on the fence on the issue. I had a father that watched me shower, and I've been to a prison with a lot of "pent up energy" so I would be a sure candidate for conditioning, but on the same token, I had my first boyfriend before any of that happened. I've always been the kinda person that if a person asked me why I was gay, I always asked them back why they were straight.|`|f7fe854f34875855e7bddc879f7c8ff9aa	A theory is that sexuality is a long continuum from being hetero to being gay.  Most people fall somewhere in between.  We are born pretty much as we are.  Sometimes opportunity causes us to tend to one way or another.  We are born with the sexual orientation which we have.  Problems arise when it is not allowed to be expressed as naturally as it should.|`|PvJdZcZTaa	Straight out, I never had a choice. From the very first moment I can remember, I'm talking about when I was 4 or so, I knew that I was gay. Unlucky for me, my family are devout Catholics. Believe me, I have tried as hard as I could for years to be "straight". Then when I went to High School, it slipped. And I've never been happier. There is no possible way I was "nurtured" into that "lifestyle"(being gay is not a lifestyle, I get offended when people say that lol).    Personally, I believe it's neither a defect or environments that make people gay. It's just nature, there are gay animals too. To claim homosexuality to be a defect is beyond stupidity. I see it as claiming being born with brown hair over blond hair as a defect. It's just dominant and recessive genes. Nothing more. Homosexuality truly does run in families. I myself have 1 gay uncle, 2 or more gay/bisexual cousins, and bisexual brothers. If everyone was open about their sexuality I'm sure it would shock the world.    Again, it's just something that always was and will be. I would not have chosen or allowed myself to be gay if it was something as simple as being nurtured into being gay considering how much intense traumatic experiences I had to go through because of it. It is NOT a choice.|`|zIiiqNGBaa	I had the feeling of liking guys ever since I was in elementary but my memory is not that good so it could be even from pre school. Anyways I just always had this attraction to guys but I never acknowledge it. Reason is because I was never taught that I could possibly end up liking guys....I was only raised to know that I am so suppose to like girls. Then during my junior year of HS I took a health class and well that was the first time someone mention the word gay without an insult or something negative coming afterward. Then yeah I began to remember all the little events in my life that would explain my attraction to guys and finally I accepted myself when I was 16.|`|wABBcVtcaa	Society has imposed many stifling specifications on what is deemed "normal", "acceptable" or "appropriate".  Throughout the history of societies, our natural sexual tendencies have been managed by an array of reasons and standards.  Medically, religiously... and even dutifully.      The sexual idiosyncrasies between the mass numbers of sexual beings that we are, continue to be as unique as our favorite flavors and colors.  Yet, at this point in societies maturity we still don't know what shade to color one section from another.        I wonder how many people would still choose chocolate over vanilla, even if societies rules decided chocolate was just not acceptable.  It was just too decadent for our own good.  If chocolate "anything" was no longer allowed.      Are we born loving chocolate?  Are we conditioned to love it?  If our older siblings liked it... would we be more apt to try it? If our parents were allergic or thought it was bad would we feel compelled to try it anyway?  Would the taboo nature of the subject draw some people into chocolate factory?      Women were chastized for years upon years re: sexual issues... re: whoredom and the pleasure principle... only very recently have they been able to openly explore their full potential as hungry unsatiable lovers without the stereotypical profiles that many of societies finest would have deemed them... though men were justified to "have needs" even if they had to fulfill them outside the home.      Our liberties re: our individual preferences have been stifled in bothe gender's sexual arenas.  Society likes to think they know what's best... and they have used many methods to denote superiority in their ways of thinking and herding the lot of us along the way.    As far as choice or nature...  (It is our nature to choose what we prefer!)
stHol8ITaa	Just tell them politely to back off.    If that doesn't work, well, you can always report them for harassment. If following someone constantly and bugging them till they conform to your beliefs and ideals is not "harassment", I don't know what is.

CfZn9kK5aa	"Have you ever fantasized that you are being intimate with another women while your husband is....? (well use your imagination)"     Yes, I have. We've both been with the same women at the same time before. She was very close and dear to us.    "Many times can only 'get off' if I fantasize about another women being down there.    Has this ever been true for you?"     That is something that I never experience my self. But there is nothing wrong with fantasizing.         I would never, EVER cheat on my husband.  There is a vast difference between cheating, and doing things with your partner and another person. Heck, it's not cheating if you have your partners permission to have sex with others.        I have been with my husband for almost 6 years. I love him dearly, I am committed to him, and I would never cheat on him.|`|A4UiGRs3aa	i have but with my fiancee so we decided together for a 3 some with another woman it was so much fun and i would recommend you have a shot.    best experience ever we try and have 3 sums twice a year now.|`|QJT5JXf2aa	I'm bi, and married. And *sort of* have the same issue.    I've been with my husband for five and a half years and while he told me when we met he understood there were things he could never give me that a woman could and that I could have relationships with women, I never found a girl willing to share. And, back then, I felt way too guilty to even try. I fantasized constantly but couldn't really bring myself to 'go for it'.     However, we've grown to be polyamorous and I am actually *legally* married to somebody else (so I basically have two husbands).     However, finding a girlfriend when you're married is far from easy, and I miss having a woman in my life terribly. It is one of those constant sources of sadness for me, because it's not only a sexual need that I miss, but for the most part, an emotional and mental one as well. And also a physical one in the sense of cuddling and whatnot.     So the result is the same as if I were monogamously married in that I haven't gotten to be with a girl and it definitely weighs on me, and I fantasize about it all the time. I *could* be with one by the parameters set in my relationship, but the ability to find a girl isn't there, so the result is the same.     As for feeling guilty, I used to, but after becoming polyamorous, that changed.    Also, I would recommend talking to your husband about this. he might be open to the idea of a threesome, or of letting you have femalexfemale relationships if you explained this to him, and if he was accepting of it, it wouldn't be cheating because you would not be going behind his back, lying to him, or betraying him.

Don't feel bad about it .If you get fired you can always get another job. :)|`|aVbLngqmaa	I think you should get promoted|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Did you wave your hand spreading the smell saying Oh that Broccili does it again, then laugh|`|RYDwwTITaa	He can't fire you for flatulence. It's not a just cause. If he terminates you, you could probably sue him for unjustified termination.|`|V4VGFyxlaa	LMAO!!!!! You can't get fired for that! That would be ridiculous!|`|gHGtoqFIaa	lmao i think the embarrassment is punishment enough|`|zwaCsOeVaa	Hahaha, your *** is about to be canned.|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	LMAO!!!|`|NYZ8ebD6aa	we're only human, now if it stunk, then damn, be sick from work for a week till it dies down|`|HSsqa0Vgaa	I think a fart can be salvaged it depends how you react to it.  After you should appologize and explain that there was nothing you could do about it.  Don't laugh and giggle like a little kid.|`|48de70cee2f6b54ff721ad64702401caaa	haaaaaaaaaahahah i laugh real loud reading your question. go see a doctor before you lost your job for serious thing and get a letter from ur doctor or something to show ur boss what is causing the fart or whats wrong with you and ur not farting on purpose and im laughing typing this but i hope u dont get fired.|`|73zdU7m1aa	I think firing is a little extreme.  However, next time this happens I would ask to be excused to go to the restroom instead of trying to hold it beyond your capacity.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Oooops.  No, you cannot be fired.|`|JwjFV5Uhaa	firering someone for farting would be pretty harsh|`|SQKSJ6Uyaa	i have no answer but...

Was it an important meeting?|`|Coi21Fhcaa	you cant help it sometimes|`|8FiJ5i81aa	fart is a human thing but u could of excused urself and gone to the rest room. as far as getting fired i doubt it.|`|7e87b9f7a30f59fd601be09dae6f1a30aa	That's pretty mean of your boss to be furious.

You should have told him, "Who smelt it delt it!!" heehee|`|stHol8ITaa	First you ask whether crapping in bins at work is okay, now you're asking this question... Man I'm glad I'm not your boss, is all I've got to say.|`|4p1m2Saeaa	next time, just start asking a question really loudly while you are farting.  It's a long shot, but maybe, just maybe, no one will notice.|`|1ol2eMjXaa	No. Farting is a great and natural occurrence in life and should praised and laughed about because they are just too funny.|`|f81f11f5ee6c2523c27fc82197dd6b2daa	Oh my god! That is so embarrassing. But we're all human after all. If your boss fires you he/she is a real jerk- the incident has nothing to do with your work performance. I know that in some states, a boss does not have to give a reason for firing an employee while in others they do. I'm not sure if that law applies in your state. I WOULD, however, apologize to your boss in writing or just in person explaining that it really wasn't intentional. Your boss may be peeved if he/she assumed you were just trying to be funny...Good luck!|`|9ImRzgckaa	Honestly depends on the state. For example Massachusetts is a "right to work state" meaning that for any reason your company can just say it's not working out and let you go. In other states, however, there are laws protecting employees. You need to look up specific laws in your state. Generally the answer would be no if it was in fact an accident, but you need to check on specific state laws ---- The good news is though, I guarantee you would win an unemployment claim though (if that is of course your only issue) and your not just an *** of an employee. Good Luck and don't eat Beans before a damn meeting !!!|`|9944787f7b97209854b4040a6d619d15aa	personal misconduct maybe. they'll probably just make you quit.|`|rGvlPAMJaa	OMG u get the award for funniest question asked...lol. You had me lmao!! As well as many of the replies you got.
MhfneF0xaa	The way I read your question is, "Will I go to Hell *because* I'm gay?" And the simplest answer to this is, "No."    First and foremost, you have to understand that *no* human being is allowed to condemn anyone to Hell. The power to do that rests with God alone, and for anyone to tell you (in *any* way) that you are going to Hell is in and of itself a grievous sin (and I mean for the person who says so).    Before I go any further, let me explain that I am a Christian, gay and celibate.    St. Paul teaches us (all of us) that, "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves." That means me, you, and anyone who would condemn you.    Having said that, I will also say that homosexual feelings do not in and of themselves constitute sin.    Homosexual acts may be sins, BUT understand that sins of the flesh are the least of all sins. And remember that we all sin, even the self-righteous.    And the sin of condemnation is one of the *worst* of all sins.    By condemning, a person puts himself in the position of God, and that is a horrible, horrible thing to do. Much worse than the person who is being "condemned."    Do you have a Bible? Read Luke 6:42. Jesus really puts it to the people who condemn, when they themselves are far more imperfect.    If you don't have a Bible, email me and I will give you one. No kidding.    With all the murder and cruelty going on in the world, can you really believe that sexuality would be more important to Our Lord?    So take heart. There is a lot of love just waiting for you to find it. Especially Jesus' love. And He loves gays just as much as anyone else.    Please email me or IM me if I can help.    Again, I'm Christian and I'm gay.    God loves all of us. Hang in there. I love you too!|`|WRSNIusaaa	lol, apparently, according to the bible (depending on how you interpret it's riddles) and the church. But you go to hell for coveting your neighbours oxen or donkey as well.  I'm gay too. I also think that, if my neighbour had a donkey, i'd probably want to have one too, possibly my neighbours if it was a nice, well behaved donkey. So if god exists then i'm probably going to hell.  If god does really exist, and those are the crappy rules he's come up with, he's not worth worshiping and i'd rather be petty and spite him by going to hell than being miserable my whole life just in case he does exist.  ... i'll probably change my mind about that when i'm in hell :-)    But i don't believe there is a god anyway. I just think that when people say things like "the bible has been misinterpreted and it doesn't say that homosexuality is an abomination" when it clearly does, they're just trying to make themselves feel better.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	I hope so    The alternative is to go to heaven with a load of puritanical hypocrites.  I don't want that.|`|AA11139157	ha, i beleive we are already in hell- what is worse than this $hithole earth we are lving in (sorry, i had a really, really, REALLY bad three days, i have to release it..)    no fiery hell could be worse than here- you'd get immune to the pain, here you never know what's going to happen.     and i do beleive in god, and even through all the turmoil life throws, he's a good god :-)     hehe good luck to you...|`|rT43plWoaa	NO WAY DOES ANYONE GO TO HELL FOR BEING GAY. People only go to hell for malicious murder. Being gay is NOT a SIN.     Be proud of who you are and be responsible in everything you do.|`|9ImRzgckaa	Think of it this way. The Bible states that Jesus says that Nobody gets to heaven but through me. I used to believe being gay would exclude getting into heaven. However, if there is in fact a heaven and Jesus than he can let anyone he wants in. Don't listen to what some preacher tells you. Listen to your heart and ask God/Jesus for answers. I know this dosn't give you a straight yes or no, but thats life. Be honest and ask and you will know.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	other peoples opinions don't matter, since only God will do with you what He will do, hell or heaven.  The bible says that "if a man lies with another man as he does with a woman, it is an abomination".....It sounds like a grievous sin, but that's about all the Bible says about homosexuality.  If you believe in Jesus, just ask Him.  Whatever mortal people tell you just doesn't matter in the end.....[no pun intended]|`|2NGmNlBVaa	BEING GAY IS NOT A SIN!! PEOPLE NEED TO BEING SO CLOSED MINDED!! IF GOD DIDN'T WANT GAY PEOPLE WHY ARE WE HERE?? AND IM SO TIRED OF PEOPLE SAYING ITS ALL IN YOUR HEAD AND UR NOT GAY U JUST THINK YOU ARE!!! NO HUNNI I AM NOT CONFUSED! I KNOW WHAT I WANT AND WHAT I LIKE! BEING GAY IS NOT A SIN! ITS LIKE SAYING UR GOING TO HELL FOR LIKEING SOMETHING PEOPLE DONT APPROVE OF!

Come on, people won't go to hell simply because they're gay!|`|NQBuO6cmaa	pssh im going there gay or not.. and no being gay is not a sin|`|sgRJRuvgaa	Romans 3:10  for there are none who are righteous not one    Romans 3:23   For we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of god    Even if it is a sin confessing to jesus and getting forgiving is what you would need.   I however do not even believe in a hell because of people who never got to know god and I believe that a loving god can see past anyones sins wheather they are reasonable sins or not because he is to understand the world and he can see why we commit them no matter how bad they may seem. and in those verses up there that also includes every person who claims to be better than you for being heterosexual that is where they sin and fall short of gods glory.|`|ErN3pbTeaa	Hell doesn't exist...    maybe try the Religion & Spirituality section.|`|c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	Only if "Hell" is the name of the newest hottest gay bar in town!

qPzxKhrlaa	Actually, they love it. It lets them feel all "persecuted" and such. After all, Joseph "prophesied" that people would persecute them because they alone have the one, true, restored truth. (And it's TRUE too!)    My favorite -- Joe said there are people living on the moon who are 9 feet tall and live to be 1000 years old. You gotta admit, the man had an imagination!|`|VPtqM31Paa	I really don't think Mormons get "angry" when you bring things like that up...but it can be "frustrating" when people bring up tangents rather than the truths of salvation...like all those things you mentioned none of them are related to a person's salvation....a person doesn't have to know about any of that, so it can be frustrating that people are focused on the 'drop' rather than on the weightier matters (such as their own eternal salvation)    but what people DO need to know are things like Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He was crucified for the sins of the world and that because of His atonement if a person repents of their sins that they can become clean and dwell in God's presence again...or that the true and authorized Priesthood of God has been restored to the earth after having been lost in the Dark Ages...and that this authorized Priesthood is required to have in order to perform ordinances of salvation (such as baptism)...things like that..    there are logical explanations to all those things you mentioned...so again, no anger but just wish we could lead people to salvation rather than them being distracted by decoys.|`|AA10637643	Because most of the things you just listed are not "truth".    99% "truth" and 1% lie = not truth    REAL TRUTH is 100%.    All religious truths come from the Holy Ghost, not from crap made up by anti-mormons.|`|AA11994092	Have you studied the teachings of Islam. Poligomy lnot only  is egal.but it is encouraged. In Islam you can have 4 wives,and as many female slaves as you own.  Only Muslims go to Jenna all othe3rs are to be killed. Islam is it legal to marry little 5 year old girls because Muhammad did it.  So it is not just Mormans ect. You need to learn about all faiths  before jumping to any hasty conclusions.|`|RKELCF86aa	its a direct attack on their beliefs.  I should know, I am an ex mormon and used to get mad too.    btw..you are correct about everything you said|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Mostly because many of the things you're bringing up are either untrue or taken out of context and so misunderstood.  We don't, for example, believe that polygamy is a requirement for anything.  Nor do we believe that a white skin is any more desirable than any other color.  Race is not a factor in anything.      And while I will admit that having the same incorrect things thrown at us all the time does get rather annoying, most of us would never get angry over such unimportant things.  They're just not worth it.|`|AA10747877	Because like some other well known religious groups, they are blinded by the devil and they cannot see the truth.|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	or is it just because your perceptions of the doctrines, teachings and standards of the LDS [aka Mormon] Church doesn't hold up?|`|WyICbuPqaa	Everything you said is almost true, but not quite.

Most people of religious belief get upset when you bring up some of the unpalatable aspect of their religion.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Because they believe Satan is undermining the truth and anti-mormons are just angry people....I know because I use to be mormon...|`|PvgZUzHjaa	Probably because they feel you are mocking their beliefs.  Possibly because they have long since come to realize that the Book of Mormon is not so much true as useful mythology.  I believe a great many people are Mormons because they like the structure of it, which is like a giant Ponzi scheme.  Everyone pays in 10% of their income, but that income is derived from other people's 10% for those at the top.  Plus they have a captive market by making it wrong to do business with non-Mormons whenever there is a Mormon business that can do the job.    Mormonism is very, very profitable.|`|g5rMMf6Laa	Because they are detached from reality.
F8GJdplRaa	hmmmmmmmmm a very dicey question.    i am usually against abortion, but if you are very sure that the child is going to be born with Tay-Sachs then i guess it is better to abort.    but sometimes tests are false, what then?    my friend was pregnant and then had some bleeding and when she went to the doctor, he did a scan and told her the baby was dead and that they had to do a D&C, but she was totally shattered and returned home to think about it, when she was at home she decided to go for a scan again and check if it was true, this scan showed that the baby was well, she had the baby, it was a lovely ,healthy boy who is now  6 years old and well.    it is a choice that the mother has to make being fully informed.    Good luck and God bless.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	get the coat hanger.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Yes, I feel like it is better to end it now than for the child to live a painful, short life.

It must be a painful decision.|`|AA11371251	yes that would be really cruel to bring him into this world but some will say it's God's will or what if he makes it longer or yadda yadda but I agree you plus they can't say your taking a life when he obviously would never have that..right?|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	No, it isn;t . Besides, with the rapid progression of medical discoveries in the last ten years alone, who is to say they may not find a cure or a treatment for Tay-Sachs. If so, then aborting the child will prevent him or her from benefitting from the new treatment. Give the child a chance to have some kind of life.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	women have a right to chose no matter what her circumstances are. in that case, abortion would probably be the best solution. i think it would be cruel to bring a kid into the world that's just going to suffer with a painful disease. 'pro lifers' will tell you any life is better than no life. they value quantity of life over quality though. they're not really pro life at all. the correct term is anti choice.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Amazing.  16 responses and nobody told you to pray and ask for guidance, which is exactly what you should do.

There are no circumstances in which abortion can be considered the morally proper alternative.      >    Yes. To think any human being isn't deserves to be killed simply because he/she has less than a clean bill of health is absurd.      >    The fact cures for certain diseases don't (yet?) exist is no excuse to deem people with those diseases unfit to live.      >    People shouldn't use abortion, period.      >    There are no circumstances in which abortion can be considered a morally proper alternative. This is a morally absolute fact.      >    The problem with your "logic" is that you equate the lack of suffering with love. Does not the Father love His Son Jesus - look how much suffering Jesus tolerated on our behalf!  There is redemptive power in suffering. To "alleviate" someone of their "suffering" is to stunt their redemption. Nothing Good can come from that.      >    There is redemptive power in suffering. Ever think of suffering in that Light?    Matt. 10:38 - Jesus said, "he who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me." Jesus defines discipleship as one's willingness to suffer with Him. Being a disciple of Jesus not only means having faith in Him, but offering our sufferings to the Father as He did.    Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34 - Jesus said, "if any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." Jesus wants us to empty ourselves so that God can fill us. When we suffer, we can choose to seek consolation in God and become closer to Jesus.     Luke 9:23 - Jesus says we must take up this cross daily. He requires us to join our daily temporal sacrifices (pain, inconvenience, worry) with His eternal sacrifice.     Luke 14:27 - Jesus said, "whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me, cannot be my disciple." If we reject God because we suffer, we fail to apply the graces that Jesus won for us by His suffering.     John 7:39 - Jesus was first glorified on the cross, not just the resurrection. This text refers to John 19:34, when Jesus was pierced on the cross by the soldier's lance.     John 12:24 - unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone and bears no fruit. Jesus is teaching that suffering and death are part of every human life, and it is only through suffering and death that we obtain the glory of resurrection.     Rom. 5:2-3 - Paul says that more than rejoicing in our hope, we rejoice in our sufferings which produces endurance, character and hope. Through faith, suffering brings about hope in God and, through endurance, salvation.     Rom. 8:17 - Paul says that we are heirs with Christ, but only if we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with Him. Paul is teaching that suffering must be embraced in order to obtain the glory that the Father has bestowed upon Jesus.     Rom. 8:18 - the sufferings of the present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. We thus have hope that any sufferings we or others endure, no matter how difficult, will pale in comparison to the life of eternal bliss that awaits us.     1 Cor. 1:23- Paul preaches a Christ crucified, not just risen. Catholic spirituality focuses on the sacrifice of Christ which is the only means to the resurrection. This is why Catholic churches have crucifixes with the corpus of Jesus affixed to them. Many Protestant churches no longer display the corpus of Jesus (only an empty cross). Thus, they only preach a Christ risen, not crucified.     1 Cor. 2:2 - Paul preaches Jesus Christ and Him crucified. While the cross was the scandal of scandals, and is viewed by the non-Christian eye as defeat, Catholic spirituality has always exalted the paradox of the cross as the true tree of life and our means to salvation.     2 Cor. 1:5-7- if we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort as well.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	Abortion is a woman's choice regardless of circumstance!|`|PvgZUzHjaa	Yes, I think it would be the right choice in that case.  And downright cruel to do otherwise.|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	i think that's up to the mother to decide. If i was in her shoes i probablly get the abortion just because i couldn't bare to see my child suffer. Either way you're going to loose that child, it just depends on the matter of time, whether you want it to end quick and fast or atleast spend some time and be able to say good bye... It's a hard decision... and you should consider whether you can take care of a child with so that many needs.|`|PlBYWZ8Saa	No. Life begins at conception, and the lord god has decreed that this boy shall suffer his entire mortal life. Because all is the beauty of his creation and to act to end the boys life would be a mortal sin. God will allow the boy to suffer, and take his life when ready.     But God loves him!       Do I think it is okay? Yes. Early abortion in the case of severe suffering is fine. In fact, if a woman chooses to have an abortion for any reason, then that is her prerogative.|`|jq85LU0gaa	The one who gives life, Takes the life

Many of them dated and socialized with other races.  I think it depends on how long the Filipino community in your area has been established and how many of them there are.  Filipinos have had a large and long presence in my area of the USA and that might contribute to the ease in which they mix with other races.    It could also be that your experience has limits, and your perception might not be telling the whole story.  It's like that with all of us :)|`|cxjLLtE1aa	yes, I work with two.

But why the bible reference? hallelujah.  Then I thought of maybe it's   About someone with faith and sin cried hallelujah.  Out from the shadows hallelujah   But in a broken angry  way...   I don't know, you can see hallelujah  I'm confused help me please   Because some people take it as a hallulajah.

Americans speak American which is derived from English.  The American language is becoming the dominant language of the world.  It is a language that incorporates several others.  Just review the dictionary to see word origins.  They come from all languages.|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	Americans speak "American". Americans used to speak English but they now speak American. The American language is derived from English, it possesses its own set of: grammatical rules; punctuation rules; sentence structure.    He said "monolingual" because American people tend to have a habit of taking another language and "Americanising" it so it sounds like a new language, for example, American-English, American-French, etc.    This is a sore point for many people and I do not in anyway deny that Americans are smart and high achievers, nor do I dismiss the fact that there will be Americans who can imitate the accent of another language and learn their rules perfectly.    You're allowed to have your opinion in the same way he can disagree or agree with you. It's a moot point, really, it's not going to affect you, you live in America.    As for being internationally centred, well I disagree with your point because he was insinuating that you cannot speak anything other than "American" - he wasn't addressing other languages. And as for the English being able to speak other languages with fluidity? They can and they do so well, especially with French because they're just over the channel and they have an easy access to the native French speakers.    I'd just drop it and be proud of who you are and not worry.          - Pepper.|`|VYWaL2graa	Sounds good to me. People just love to bash on us American's.

Aside from that, it wouldn't phase me much. We already have an LDS church on every few blocks. The only change a temple would bring is blocking part of the sky from my view.

They'll attract a small amount of traffic, be a good landmark, and increase the quality of the neighborhood and increase property values.      Do you generally hang out with arsonists and criminals???    You clearly have no idea what is going on in the real estate world do you?  You've just demonstrated your ignorance.    There's been a massive nation-wide real estate boom and bust.  While it was smaller in Utah, it still occurred.  As soon as they announced the draper temple site, property values immediately shot up.  The dive that you're talking about has absolutely nothing to do with the temple.  It is simply that homes in that price range were severely over built because credit, especially sub prime credit, was extended too freely.  It happened in Alpine, Highland, Lehi, Riverton, Draper, North Salt Lake, Centerville, Fruit Heights, Saint George, etc.  Pretty much every piece of real estate in Utah has been affected....including draper.      Still don't believe me?  Here's an article, about the Draper temple, called:  "Temple raising home values"  http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn...    one paragraph states:  "Benji Nelson, a developer and land owner in the Corner Canyon area, sold all of the lots in his "Cove" subdivision when word of a Draper temple was still a rumor last year. But with a temple guarantee announced in November, the 1/2-acre lots he sold for $150,000 are selling quickly for more than $300,000."      You hate Mormons....we get it.

AA10213887	im not catholic but i am a christian, God is in heaven, Satan is in the bottom less pit i guess it is hell, he has access to roam earth, and even scarier heaven, he accuses us of our mistakes and sins before God night and day, one day he will be hurled down into the bottom pit in the lake of fire, i believe he is in hell, but he has acces to 3 realms, earth our realm in the bible it says he has the power over earth, heaven where God is enthroned and hell where he resides, so he is roaming every where trying to destroy every one including us, followers of Christ. Satan will gather his followers and unbelievers together for battle to decieve them one last time, he will fight against God the angels, etc.. read revelations more it tells.|`|AA11796124	HELL  The place and state of eternal punishment for the fallen angels and human beings who die deliberately estranged from the love of God. There is a twofold punishment in hell: the pain of loss, which consists in the deprivation of the vision of God, and the pain of sense, which consists in the suffering caused by outside material things. The punishment of hell is eternal, as declared by Christ in his prediction of the last day (Matthew 25:46), and as defined by the Fourth Lateran Council, stating that the wicked will "receive a perpetual punishment with the devil" (Denzinger 801). The existence of hell is consistent with divine justice, since God respects human freedom and those who are lost actually condemn themselves by their resistance to the grace of God.|`|ThbvzS2Waa	Catholics claim that Satan was once an angel so he probably has the same powers of an angel and he is omni-present like God and I'm soooooo confused.|`|KIGy44SPaa	Satan can go to hell for all I care|`|VERrlErvaa	I'm not a Catholic and here's why - they WANT to confuse people.    Satan currently walks the earth - he was cast down with his rebellious group and stalks it.  Read the book of Job and you will see what I mean.  The Roman Catholic Church have made up a whole bunch of lies; and worse, changed the 10 Commandments to suit them.  They also changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, to fall in with their ancient pagan practices of worshipping the Sun God.    Can you imagine the audacity and ignorance of any Church that would take the Word of God and then change it?    The RCC have removed the commandment regarding not worshipping idols; and have taken the tenth commandment and split it in two so no-one would notice that there had been any changes have been made.    So what is so bad about that?  Catholics bow down in front of statues of Mary, and Christ... The true 2nd Commandment is "You shall have no other gods before Me.  You shall not make for yourself a carved image - any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them.  For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me."  Exodus 20:3-5    Don't be fooled by the RCC; they actually hijacked Christianity and it is a false Church - depending on whether or not you're a Christian, this is very important.  By worshipping images of Mary and Christ, you are going against the 2nd commandment.  (Unless you have a Catholic bible... which is filled with lies).  The RCC is an apostate Church - and is satanical in its doctrines and in its actions over history.  Just have a look at any history book and you will see how much blood they have spilled.    Satan will be destroyed in hellfire once the final battle between him and Christ is over.    If you would like to know more; I can suggest a very good website.  www.worldslastchance.com  They have a lot of information on the Book of Revelation and a large Answers section that can guide you through the entire process.    Just, whatever you do, stay away from Roman Catholicism... This is a Church, after all, that is currently run by a former Nazi who has just forgiven a Holocaust denier.  What more proof does the world need that the Vatican is a seat of evil?|`|AA10747877	He's not in hell yet because he's too busy working in catholicism and the other false religions of the world.

It is for after judgment when God will separate Good from Evil forevermore.  Now Good and Evil co-exists.  We are the ones limited by the physical, but Satan and God are spiritual., not physical.|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, I think you'll find that there is no firm ("official") teaching regarding this matter in the Roman Catholic Church.  We see in Revelation that Satan  a) loses a war in heaven  b) is imprisoned in an abyss    But these are things normally considered to be *future* events.  Thus, from this, it would seem that Satan is "free" to travel where he wishes, whether in hell or on earth.  We see also, from Satan's temptation of Jesus, that he most definitely has access to the earth.    SO, I think you were given a partially-correct answer, at least.  Satan is thrown into the lake of fire - his eternal punishment - after losing Armageddon.  However, Hell (Hades) is *also* thrown into the lake of fire at that time.  Therefore, at the present time it would seem that Hell is not in the lake of fire and neither is Satan.

There is too much difference between Catholic and non-Catholic. How many non-Catholics are willing to reject birth control, accept raising the children in the Catholic Faith, and attend Mass with the family on Sunday even though she cannot receive Holy Communion?    The fact that you're seriously considering lying to someone you care about, about something so important when considering a marriage partner, speaks to your unreadiness to get married.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Honey, if you love each other and treat each other well, then it should not matter. I would tell her before you marry but let her know that you respect her and her views. If she also respects you and your views as well, then you should be ok.

I also attended a Lutheran school while in first grade. They had a good marriage that lasted 45 years, until her death, so different religions can indeed be a non-issue.    I can't tell you what to do about your situation. But if you are serious about each other... It's probably best to be upfront about this before you get married. If she really has a problem with your beliefs, then you probably shouldn't be together anyway.|`|lvAEDKPBaa	Definitely!|`|3TjiJls7aa	what in the world! just tell her!  if its really that big of deal you probably shouldn't be dating her|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	I could only date another Born Again Christian.|`|PvgZUzHjaa	Please tell me this is just a joke.

And if it got as far as marriage; you have to realise that she will be taking her vows very seriously - and that it would not benefit you to go into it with a secret that could pull you apart in the future and destroy any family you may have as a consequence.    Just be yourself, be honest and see what happens.  If you're still happy to attend church with her, regardless, and you tell her that, she may feel more secure.  Just don't tell her lies or hold back the truth.    If you do, it will come back to bite you on the backside and that's never a good path to travel down.    Good luck; make the right decision|`|cECRv4NMaa	Not only did I date someone of a different religious belief, but we have been married for over 21 years.
GEfUTyi8aa	Okay, do you realize you are about to take a hallucinogenic (something that makes you see all sorts of crazy things).... and that school is not a good place to do any of that?  Your teachers will know... you wont be able to contain yourself.... and you will be kicked out of school for a period of time.  Now, you said your mother is on chemo... is that a nice thing to do to her while she is fighting for her life??  Your mother is fighting to stay alive... and your worried about taking shrooms at school because it is to inconvenient for you to take them at home due to your mothers illness!    And.... these days drugs... even so called natural ones such as mushrooms.. still have contaminants... you dont know who has handled them, what they have immersed them in... you could be eating dried up **** immersed in battery acid for all you know.    I think and this is an honest opinion from someone who watched her friends do this crap... that you should just throw them away and dont bother.. its not worth the consequences.   Be good to your mom.|`|fAKKv0ytaa	School is the last place you want to take mushrooms. It's a guaranteed bad trip if you do, not to mention that EVERYONE will know you are on something.

c40692e8f41f1f9fcd1571bce1ccb576aa	Researches are being done by the English speaking people. They are getting Noble Awards for their contribution in various fields. Engineering, Medical and Managements books are available in English. What is the contribution of non English speaking people in Science and technology? English is not trying to overrule Hindi but we are responsible for the circumstances. If, we wish to change the situation, we will have to work hard, what others contributed for their language. This is the truth and we must be ready to accept the truth. Car kee number plate hindi main likhney sey hindi develop naheen ho saktee.|`|IlndnVyBaa	yeah but isn't that a good thing? its an international langugae|`|h8Kfjzppaa	Take over Hindi? Never. However, it depends upon what part of the country you are in. In the big cities, English is readily mixed with Hindi (Hinglish, people call it), which is why more English has infiltrated the dialog of Hindi (Bollywood) films. In fact, most of the scripts for Hindi films are in English because some of the actors (especially those from other parts of India who's first language isn't Hindi or from outside of the country) know just enough Hindi to get them by on the streets. The big cities are just much more cosmopolitan with many international companies doing business there. Hindi is still spoken by 1/3rd of the country's population. Depending upon which site you go to, Hindi ranks in the top five of the world's most spoken language.    English is taught in most schools as part of the curriculum, but in the smaller towns and villages, Hindi is more dominant (at least in the middle to northern parts of India). While English is prevalent in India and always will be, Hindi, and other Indian languages, is too much a part of the national culture and pride for English to take over.|`|xF8TvlhYaa	China, Japan,Russia and many other countries  now feel the importance of English.They now promote English learning on a big scale.    Luckily for India English had remained with us even though the English people left us.    I will not say Hindi is being pushed back by English. Both have their place and role to play in changing world.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	No. May be in higher education and corporation world it is true but over all Hindi is prospering.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	international language always has an upper hand....|`|NaNplX1naa	Yes in many zones it is. in the inter national companies in computer world and media english rule over hindi. People from south India are not very familiar with Hindi language.   Political leaders on high post too some times not able to speak in Hindi.students from medical collages and engineering kind find books in any other language but english. all such cases English dominate Hindi.
k5izERYnaa	A stereotype of female gymnasts is that people think they're good in bed because they're flexible XD|`|J3Dva3sAaa	People think that men gymnasts are "gay" or feminine because it is sometimes seen as a girly sport.

You see it on here all the time people write in about once a dau asking if they are to old to start gymnastics, and many of these askers are onl 11 or 12.  Gymnastics is not a childrens sport.  You can start it at any age and you can enjoy it at any age and you can compete and become good at any age.    ANother is that all gymnasts are short.  Again not true.  Gymnastics is easier if you are short.  It is rare to see tall female gymnasts at the international level but there are many tall gymnasts competing level 10 and college level gymnastics.

LjNJiqCZaa	Did you really fall in love on Valentine's Day, like the first line of your poem says?    I find that the most sweetly romantic poems usually don't actually have the word 'love', 'valentine', 'heart', 'rose', etc in them.  The trouble with love poems is that so many of them have been written, it's tough to find a new or original way to say what you feel.  You can try writing a more innovative poem if you make a list of cliched words and phrases and then intentionally write your poem without them ('world turned upside down' is common, for example). However, that said, this poem is a great way to introduce the chocolate and the rose.  Maybe just switch up the delivery and tighten up the rhymes?      I'll edit this in a bit and give an example, if i can think of one.    EDIT:  I THOUGHT OF ONE!  Keep in mind, I really encourage you to write your own.  This just sort of sums up what i mean about getting around words people use all the time.    I'm every man on every ship   That Helen brought to Troy,  You drew me like a moth to flame  This was the real McCoy,    The brightest rose is gray and worn  Compared to my heart's passion,  The sweetest sweet is only clay  The reddest wine is ashen.     Chocolate and roses  Can't compare to all my joy,  Your presence is a better gift...  I've fallen, just like Troy.    (and then give her the chocolate and rose?)    Keep in mind, all this stuff I'm saying is just constructive criticism.  Feel free to read it to her exactly as you wrote it without changing a thing, I'm positive she'll still swoon.|`|AA12318686	Swwweeeeettt !|`|44NNQCuGaa	Very romantic but not very imaginative.

I've wondered if it's tied to speaking publicly and the embarrassment and fear that comes with that. Who knows? That's an educated guess. Some people will never really understand that speaking out in different situations is just not the way others do things.

(for example, i've learned english for 12 years, every day 1 hour and I still don't feel so confident in it)    also, for example if you have learned a language in the university while others are already preparing for a certain profession, you will most probably need to continue learning to have something to do with that language.    3) go abroad. and especially don't learn languages in the US :) you already are handicapped (never seen an american who wouldn't have heavy accent) so, consider exchange programs (you should ask specifically for area where they don't speak english, otherwise you'll end up speaking english all the time and you just waste your money)    the minimum for learning a language from 0 in the natural environment is about 3 months, 5 months much better. you probably won't be able to activate a language with 3 months

2HKEuugNaa	People cheat for various reasons.  Some cheat just because the opportunity arises and it's so easy to just go with it, others get bored of the relationship they're in and want to experience something different, and some people do it because it's the easiest way to break up with their significant other.    Personally, I don't condone cheating, so these are just observations that I've made from the people around me.    Sorry you got cheated on, that must have really hurt, but you'll find someone better :)
uEBuNRY8aa	Not necessarily. She might even be saying it because she expects you to find it hot, and want it to turn you on. Or she's bicurious and a little confused. Although those are just options, and you should trust her word.     If she would have SEX with a girl and enjoy it and repeat the experience, then yes, she is biSEXual.    But just because she enjoys lesbian porn, that alone doesn't mean she's bisexual. A number of women think about women when they masturbate (myself among them), and become confused about their sexuality because of it (myself among them), and then try to have sexual relations with girls (myself among them), and realize that the fantasizing is really just a healthy appreciation for the female body and its pleasures, and let's face it: girls are hot, and the noises we make and the ways that we bounce and writhe and our facial expressions are very sexually stimulating. But I don't want to have sex WITH girls - the thought turns me off. Your girlfriend is bisexual.    As to the religion thing - I'm very very Christian and accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior and believe that the love of God and His presence is in everything I do... and the pastors at the churches I've gone to have always been gay, sometimes with partners. It depends on the denomination of her faith, not how strong it is.|`|HGfUY3lbaa	well the whole bi thing between guys and girls is way diffrent idk why i dident make the rules but basicly 2 guys together is guy or bi if they also  like girls. in todays socity it is ok for a girl to do what ever with another girl i would say if she was intrested in dating girls to then ya shes bi but but if shes WILLING TO HAVE SEX WITH A GIRL BRO DONT BE A FOOL THATS CODE FOR 3 WAY SO GET ON THAT ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!  as religen goes i really dont think any mainstrem religen such as christianity aprove of bis and guys but with socity changing some religens still frown upon it but its more excepted|`|A4UiGRs3aa	it is completely normal       she is not bi        on valentines day or a special event hire another  girl and have fun she will love you for ever|`|ZiutBoAVaa	You are a lucky man.

Couple of interesting options:   You try a threesome and she finds her desire for women really strong and wants more-- with you.   You try a threesome and she finds her desire for women really strong and wants more-- without you.  You try a threesome and you find your desire for more women really strong and want more-- with her.  You try a threesome and you find your desire for more women really strong and want more-- without her.  Either way, somebody will lose in this relationship. The only way to keep this one going is to not bring up the subject again. She has shown a strong interest in being with a woman, the desire is there. She may act on it on her own.

1wNsBNmxaa	Fascinating Facts  In 1723, the Delaware Indians settled Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania as a campsite halfway between the Allegheny and the Susquehanna Rivers. The town is 90 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, at the intersection of Route 36 and Route 119.    Groundhog Day 2009   Will Punxsutawney Phil See His Shadow or Not?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM0-G80Eo...    The Delawares considered groundhogs honorable ancestors. According to the original creation beliefs of the Delaware Indians, their forebears began life as animals in Mother Earth and emerged centuries later to hunt and live as men.    Some say the name Punxsutawney comes from the Indian name for the location ponksad-uteney which means the town of the sandflies.    As the story goes, Punxsutawney Phil was named after King Phillip. Prior to being called Phil, he was called Brer Groundhog.    The name woodchuck comes from the Indian legend of Wojak, the groundhog considered to be their ancestral grandfather.    Punxsutawney Phil has been making predictions for more than 120 years.      Relic66~~~?|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	Yes, it's based on an old Greek myth, based on animal souls existing in their shadows.  The groundhog is a hibernating animal, where hibernation is symbolic for death; the groundhog "dies" in winter and is "reborn" in Spring.  If the groundhog sees its shadow, or soul, it means that it's not ready to be reborn, and this is taken as a sign that all of nature's rebirth will take longer, meaning more weeks of winter.  If the groundhog does not see its shadow, that means it is ready for rebirth, and Spring will be coming on time.     It's all superstition.|`|shGl8vWiaa	No not a myth........  its proven science.............|`|RWgjnwl9aa	No it is not a myth this has been proven that if the groundhog sees his shadow 6 more weeks of winter|`|6JXrlnYsaa	Do you really think it's possible that a rodent can predict the WEATHER?

Yes, really.    And Western PA is damn lucky to get rid of winter by mid-March.  It's usually mid-April.    It's just another stupid thing that people do.  Kind of like the Stupid Bowl.|`|d2c88feb0368d8e6a908ca2052ae52acaa	It don't really matter we still get 6 weeks of winter yet, I don't buy into any of that
PvgZUzHjaa	The example is just one thing about yourself, and it is in fact denial to simply deny.  But forced belief in that sense is not so much belief as self-brainwashing.  It doesn't work for long.    Now, there are things you can change about yourself, lots of them.  But it's not by simply saying it over and over again.  It's by making the changes that are necessary to have the effect you desire.  For example, if you think that you are ignorant, you study and learn and use your reason and work at it.  If you feel that you are unattractive, you consult with a cosmetologist or other expert.  If you think you are too emotional, you can talk to a therapist.    But you cannot change the nature of your sexual desires.  You can change the nature of your sexual behavior, but it may not be very satisfying.  I say accept who you are, and strive to live an ethical life consistent with your nature.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Have your friend prove it - by telling herself over and over that she's not straight.

ZuzSUymFaa	I kind of understand where you are coming from because I have a 19-year-old son who firmly believes in equality in how each gender is treated.  He feels that when it comes to manners and respect, no gender should be treated differently than the other.  He will open doors for someone if the person needs him to, but not because they are a female.  He will be polite around those old enough to be his parents or grandparents, but only because he has respect for them - not because of their age or gender.  My son is not nearly as polite as you seem to be, however I have been told by many people my age that he is very polite and considerate.  I am shocked at times when I am told that because he has been known for having a foul mouth sometimes and for being very rude.  Still for him, if a person has earned his respect by simply being polite and considerate themself, then he will behave the same way in return.  My son is of the same mindset that of course he will give up his seat to a pregnant woman (or an elderly person), but like you, he believes that if he had his arms full of packages, then someone ought to give up their seat for him.      I have a son AND a daughter and I have done my best to teach them both to treat others the way they want to be treated and to treat both sexes equally.  Far too many men are made the butt of demeaning jokes and are made to look like doofuses on tv shows wherein the woman looks intellectually superior.  I have told my daughter especially, that under no circumstances is she to ever hit, slap or punch a guy or kick him in the groin unless in self-defense.  Too many girls learn from elementary-school-age that when they are frustrated with a guy, they can assault a guy (which is what it is if not done in self-defense), yet if the guy were to do the same to them, he would be in serious trouble or look like an absolute jerk.  I intentionally leave the toilet seat up for my husband after using the restroom and he will put it down for me.  It's all about simple respect and courtesy.  Why is it that women expect the guys to put down the seat so she can sit, but they refuse to lift the seat so the guy can stand?  There are far too many double-standards where manners and consideration are concerned.  Now of course if you are expecting guests in the bathroom, then it simply looks better to leave the seat down, but that's about manners and neatness more than it is about fairness to one gender over another.    I don't believe that people should get a free pass to be rude or unkind just because they are a particular gender or age.  If a guy holds open a door for a woman, then props to him for being polite.  If he pulls a chair out for her, then good for him again.  Still, his reason for doing so should not be out of a strict sense of chivalry, but rather out of simple politeness and consideration.  I have opened plenty of doors for men, though I am a woman.  If a person is close enough behind me that the door will hit them in the face after I exit through it, then I hold it open for the person behind me.  If I see someone approaching a door and they appear to be disabled in some way or are in a hurry or have their hands full, I will open the door without hesitation because I would hope that someone would do the same for me under similar circumstances.  I agree wholeheartedly with you that chivalry and bieng polite should not be one-way and that everyone should practice it - not just guys.  .    I am concerned that it appears that your mother is trying to show off how chivalrous and polite you are.  At family gatherings, those are the times when people should feel free to let their hair down and be themselves, even if they are practicing good manners while doing so.  Family gatherings are not the place to enforce strict rules of conduct and manners that others at the gatherings are not also required to abide by.  In other words, if you are expected to pull out chairs for the ladies of the family, then all the males there should be expected to as well.  As the mother of a son AND a daughter, I applaud your mother for trying to instill in you an attitude of respect and chivalry toward women.  That is a noble thing because when a man treats a woman with respect and politeness, she in turn wants to treat him the same way.  It is a win-win situation.  It is not about one gender lording authority or special privileges over the other gender.  It is about old-fashioned values which originated for a good reason - to instill respect and decency into people so that we will have a more polite and well-mannered society.  Still, while it is noble of your mother to try to instill these values in you, she is going too far.  She is making a spectacle of you and you are feeling demeaned in the process.  That isn't right.  For me, that ranks right up there with tv sitcoms wherein the man is always portrayed as a doofus while the women are intellectually superior, or jokes that are made at a man's expense simply because he is a man.  As I've said, I have a son AND a daughter and I have tried to teach both of my kids that respect and manners is something we should all practice toward each other, irrespective of gender or age.  I have told both of my kids to treat others the way they would want to be treated and it will come back to bless them in the form of others treating them kindly as well.  My daughter has been taught not to hit, slap or punch a guy, nor to kick him in the groin.  Too many females think they can do this, however if a guy did that to a female, he would get in trouble, look like a horrible person and possibly even go to jail, depending upon the circumstances.  My daughter knows that if she assaults a guy (which is what slapping, hitting, punching or kicking a guy is, if it is not done out of self-defense), she should expect to be assaulted right back because nobody should be treated that way.    So my point is that I would try to talk to your mo|`|zT2aGwzlaa	Acerus,    Good post!    Your mom is trying to instill in you values that will serve you well in adulthood and she happens to be right: Behaving in a "chivalrous" manner *will* serve you well, whether or not you agree with the practice. Women and men alike will see you as well-mannered, gentlemanly and socially adept. These traits alone won't get you very far, but when combined with other traits like intellect and knowledge, you will find doors being opened for *you* that otherwise may have remained closed (pun intended:) People who are in a position to help you achieve your goals (and we all need help) will be more inclined to do so if they feel good about you.     Your concern that you're being made to be a servant to the women in the family makes me think the women in the family aren't responding in kind; otherwise, you'd be glad to behave gentlemanly to them. When a gentleman behaves chivalrously to a lady, he should be rewarded by her *genuine*, lady-like appreciation, but it sounds like you're being treated as though it's your duty. Don't forget that you shouldn't do things (like being well mannered) *because* of what you get in return; you should do them because they're the right things to do, and you should hold your head high when doing them no matter the response you get. *Never* hang your head when doing the right thing!    As to the value of being chivalrous, consider this: Would you want to date a girl who wasn't feminine? A girl who didn't behave at least a bit on the lady-like side? Men like women to be feminine and to be ladies. Ladies like men who have a seemingly natural gentlemanly air about them: That air comes only from practice, and that's what your mom is giving you. Some day you'll thank her: seriously!    One more thing to consider: when *you* are behaving in a manner that is based on sound principles--like chivalry--and you don't get in return what you expect, you will always have the peace-of-mind that comes from knowing that *you* are behaving well without regard to how it's received.    Lastly: Who says you can't stand when men leave the table? Most of the courtesies that men render to women under the label "chivalry" are just good manners and common courtesy. If your issue really is about a double-standard, then talk it through with your mom and find some common ground that works for you both.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	It is great that your mother is teaching you manners, but as you have seen yourself, there is a difference with good manners and old fashioned courtesy, which you call chivalry.  Why don't you sit down with both your parents to discuss.  You may suggest that at your age you understand the difference between a family or business/official function, and you would now prefer to be treated as an adult and  be allowed to choose yourself how to react to each situation.  Also tell her, that of course, when you are at an official function you will be on best behaviour and thank her for caring to teach you correct etiquette.  I just had a discussion with my children regarding their manners, which is my fault.  Thank your mum, because when you do go out to expensive restaurants or business functions in the future,  you will know exacting how to behave.|`|gZXQ7jxCaa	Your mother is just rightly trying to teach you how to be a gentleman and how to treat a lady which is a good thing.  In fact I wish more parents would teach their sons how to be gentleman and girls how to be ladies since most young men women don't know how act like neither anymore.  I agree with equal respect between the genders but the courtesy can sometimes differ between the two as well since equal doesn't mean identical nor identical treatment.  I mean men and women are different and mays ways as well and don't need to treated completely the same as the other  to be considered equal.  I agree that she may be going a bit overboard like the standing for a lady was something back in 19 century but the others things are pretty good and shouldn't make yo feel like a servant since a considered woman wouldn never take your chivalrous gestures for granted.  Plus people are forgetting is woman also used to be more chivalrous in the past and held themselves in a ladylike conduct.  I think you talk this more over with father and get his input plus I already sent you two emails you regarding this topic so feel free to email me back for more on chivalry is you like.    Note to the person that said chivalry is demeaning towards women thats not true most women appreciate it and wished would increase like in the old days and blame extreme feminism gone overboard for it's decrease.    Chimichana I have to sligtly disagree on some of your coments I agree that girls shouldnt' go hitting anybody in fact I find it unladylike but I don't condone any guy to strike a female because men are physically stronger and ungentleman like  I hope you taught your son that too.|`|SIfrAHxraa	Having chivalry these days, especially amongst young men like yourself, is very rare.  When I was about 8 months pregnant and couldn't even stand on my feet anymore, I got on the bus with my husband, and noone offered up a seat (Hartford, CT).  Then out of nowhere this kid couldn't be more than 7 years old, got up and said, "Ma'am, you can have a seat".  I almost busted out in tears because of the fact that his parents are raising a gentleman.    Don't feel degraded when you are being a gentleman.  It's a characteristic that few men possess these days.  You may be tired of doing all of what your mom tells you to do, but in the long run, it'll be a big payout....escpecially when it comes to meeting "the folks" or your gf brother(s).  Take pride in what your being told and take that chivalry and run like hell with it.      You'll be turning 18 soon, until then, do what your mother says, because technically, you still belong to her. ;-)|`|hMS2BUzIaa	Wow... Acerus, this is one of the few questions on Yahoo I've read that has proper spelling, grammar etc... I'm impressed - but that's beside the point.  The statements you have made are very valid.  I see your mom is trying to raise a real gentleman and that is an extremely attractive quality, especially these days.  I also see that she is perhaps taking it a bit too far... At 17 you seem to have a good grasp of proper etiquette and manners and also respect.  Talk to your mom about how you feel when she makes you stand when a woman leaves the table etc.  Explain that nowadays unless you're dining with the Queen of England... it's just a smidgen over the top to be expected to behave that way as we no longer live in medieval times where the knights code and courting prevailed.  Pulling a chair out for a lady at the beginning of a meal is perfectly fine.  Opening doors for them, that sort of thing, fine.  Here's the thing.  Don't feel degraded (EVER!) for behaving like a complete and utter gentleman.  Do it with grace and style rather than with humiliation.  A woman will certainly NEVER feel like you are being her "servant" by you observing these types of traditions.  It simply shows her that you are being respectful and appreciative of the fact that she is a woman.  Nothing makes a real woman feel more special than chivalry from a man.  Look at someone like George Clooney... yes he's good looking BUT, he's also very chivalrous and that's what makes him doubly attractive.  Remember chivalry is used to describe courteous behavior, especially that of men towards women.    (Edit: Of course it goes without saying that woman should also be courteous and respectful towards men!)|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	Wow - you are a little old to be treated like that by your mother.  It's good that she's teaching you, but at 17 you should already be taught by now.  If you tell your mum that you're old enough to behave in a grown up and chivalrous manner, and then still be polite and courteous to women, she should be ok with that.  And then you can slowly start treating people in the way that you really want to.|`|ieCuJVZtaa	Tell your mother this the 21st century.     Women shouldn't expect their men to be knights in shining armor anymore, if they ALSO expect to be treated equal. So long as a man treats a woman as his equal in as many ways as he can think of (ie socio-economically, maritally, intellectually, etc), he shouldn't have to also be chivalrous. In fact, I'd think it would be DEMEANING for a woman to be treated that way, because then it basically invites men to believe that women are delicate and need to be elevated in particular social situations IN ORDER to feel equal. It encourages gender roles and discourages anyone acting outside of the 'norm'. Women ARE strong, and that means no chivalry.    In another sense, it is also like asking a man to make up for the past 4000+ years of sexism. That's completely unrealistic and isn't fair to a modern man who is trying is best to do the right thing.    Granted, there will always be sexism that can't be completed corrected, but chivalry is making the process of equality go backwards, NOT forwards.    Tell your mother these things. I would not be surprised at all if you, more than her even, treat women more equally than she does.    Edit: (After reading some other people's posts) Giving up your seat to a pregnant woman is shouldn't be considered something chivalrous. It should be common sense, goodness, and any man (or woman, even), who doesn't give their seat up to someone pregnant needs to be told some manners, whether they are chivalrous manner or not.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I'm OLD, and I think your mother is carrying this too far.  Actually some women feel insulted to have a door opened for them, and standing for ladies was going out with my youth.  I stand for all people who I'm going to shake hands with upon entering a room, but never anymore stand because a lady stands, simply because she is a lady.    What to do....probably nothing right now.  You might get some modern books on etiquette from the library and see what is said.  Perhaps if Miss Manners has changed her opinion, so will your mother.  I LIKE good manners and proper etiquette, but etiquette does change, and I think this went out soon after white gloves and dropping a hankie to get a man's attention.    While you live under her roof, you'll probably have to do some of these things, and they won't hurt you.  Later in life some ladies might even compliment you for walking "curbside" and knowing some of the old traditions.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	It is always important to be polite.  And yes, women are the fairer sex and generally accorded more pampering shall we say.  Your mom may be going overboard a bit.  If you are in a social setting it is best to stand (not in a fast food restaurant but a real social setting).  If you are doing it at her families house that is not etiquette but more like punishment.  Let her know that you do know the difference and the proper time to be chivalrous.|`|AA10672818	your mom is giving you tools for your further|`|Fls9Zwr4aa	I think you should tell you mom how you feel.

Are you sure you haven't gone a little extreme in your description of her?    If you expect reciprocation, then you've missed the point of chivalry. Everybody has his own standard of civility below which he will not go without extreme provocation.    Your mother is trying to raise this level. Obviously it's not yours, so you feel uncomfortable.     Is this behaviour common among the members of your mother's family?  If not, you could talk to them for help.  Or your father.    I'm sure your girlfriend loves this behviour. lol. Otherwise you could grin and bear it. It's annoying but it's not going to last forever.

It can be the tiniest detail of personality that separates us from... well, us. People may work together in similar clothes, and they may follow a similar hero as one people, but in the end, it is not how we dress and act after role models that defines us - it is the brain inside of each of our heads, and how we so choose to shape our own realities from the mind.

Things we read, see on tv, our friends, our parents, even total strangers.       "I think therefore I am"    You have your own thoughts and mind seperate from the rest of the world.  You are an individual in that perspective.
8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	Yet again, they fail to see.    Sorry to say that the athests are clearly too blind to see the actual question.  It would be too Earth shattering for them to accept the notion of the question, much worse having to formulate a cogent answer, because forming an answer that actually answers the question would shatter their belief system.    Have you tried asking the question in as simple language as possible?  Like say...    You say that religion is a response to fear.  Yet religions were not popular in their early stages BECAUSE of the fear of something new.  Yet, even in the presence of fear these religions were able to take root and flourish.    That's not too clear either.  Sorry.  It should be possible.    Maybe instead of asking them why, ask them HOW.  "How did religions take root if they were not accepted at first?"  They will only be able to answer your question if they accept your notion.    You make a very very good point by the way.  Although I think it might only be true for the standard religions of today: Christianity, Islam, Buddhism.  I don't think it's applicable to natural religions like those of natives from around the world.  Those religions I think were a search for understanding of the world and were not met with much opposition.  But we don't have much history of the early stages of those religions.  There is a third type of religion, the imposed religion.  I would have to say that the Egyption, Greek, Roman, and Mayan/Aztec religions were of that type.  Those religions were about giving/maintaining the leaders power.  I think a lot of atheists lump all 3 types of religions together and so believe that Christianity is about power.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	What a false and silly claim that demonstrates you have little idea what an atheist is an even less of an idea about religions - yet it is all easy to look up!!    ATHEIST -  someone who does not believe in a God  any God  not just the Christian one.  But that does not mean they do not hold strong moral or religious beliefs!  They can follow any religion that does not have a god and there are a lot of those!!    So great religions like BUDDHISM  Religious teaching from Buddha and his followers that by destroying greed, hatred and delusion (the cause of all suffering) man can attain perfect enlightenment!!    and, TAOISM - A system of religion and philosophy based on the teachings of  Lao-tze 6th century Chinese philosopher advocating a simple and honest life and non interference with the course of natural events.    And so many more!!  Add christians and muslims together and they amount to just under a third of the world population the majority of the rest is made up of atheists and religions without gods!!  So they are in the majority!!!    The Pope and catholic church accept evolution!!    Lord Carey the  former Archbishop of Canterbury described your post rather well last week when he said "Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth"!!!

Second of all, sure, some messages religion offers are wonderful.  Love thy neighbor, don't steal, don't murder.  But think about it for a moment.  I'm an atheist and I don't steal, and I've never killed someone.  You don't really need the message that religion delivers because social norms like no murdering are embedded in society already.    So now look at the wars that have been waged over religion.  All the evil that organized religion has caused.  The crusades, the spanish inquisition, etc.  Men kill each other when their religious messages are almost identical.  Where's the sense in that?    Atheists don't ignore the messages, they just already know the important parts.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	You seem to be the one that doesn't get US.      "...but not that there was a man with a positive message with a notion of God."    If we don't believe that, why would we say it?      I'm sorry, but historically the origins of religions come from stories people created as explanations for things they had no understanding of. Not necessarily out of fear. As in...the world really isn't flat is it?    i.e. Look up all the many tribal "myths" for various topics. We ALL started like that, we ALL go back to tribal people. Their stories they told around the fire eventually evolved into religion.    That religious would be made up around some person like Jesus is a much later concept.

Messengers of any Christain message had no opposition.    Most people couldnt read back then, they just accepted anything anybody of authority told them    That ends your argument right there    Religion was bred from ignorance and arrogance, its that simple - People just think after being alive for a few years that somehow they';ve figured out the entire meaning of life and the universe as a whole: goddidit    Science on the other hand is passed down, and changes as the world changes, we inherit knowledge and it builds each generation - and we still don't know the meaning of life - thats wayyyy more reasonable to accept, that the people who bring you computers and medicine havnt figured it out, why do people with torches and big sticks somehow beat that 4000 years ago?    Religion brang us the dark ages instead, years and years of no advance in technology or philosophy    Don't even compare them, its no contest which brings us a better world

This one Church of Christ, which we confess in the Creed as one, holy, catholic and apostolic []. This Church, constituted and organised in this world as a society, subsists in the Catholic Church, governed by the successor of Peter and the Bishops in communion with him.    Christian Communities born out of the Reformation of the sixteenth century:    It is possible, according to Catholic doctrine, to affirm correctly that the Church of Christ is present and operative in the churches and ecclesial Communities not yet fully in communion with the Catholic Church, on account of the elements of sanctification and truth that are present in them. Nevertheless, the word subsists can only be attributed to the Catholic Church alone precisely because it refers to the mark of unity that we profess in the symbols of the faith (I believe... in the one Church); and this one Church subsists in the Catholic Church.          According to Catholic doctrine, these Communities do not enjoy apostolic succession in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constitutive element of the Church. These ecclesial Communities which, specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood, have not preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery cannot, according to Catholic doctrine, be called Churches in the proper sense

[Soothly this thing we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we that live, that be residue, or left, in the coming of the Lord, shall not come before them that slept, or died.]       16 For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven, in the commandment, and in the voice of an archangel [in the commanding, and in the voice of the archangel], and in the trump of God; and the dead men that be in Christ, shall rise again first.       17 Afterward we that live, that be left, shall be snatched (up) together with them in clouds, meeting Christ in the air; and so evermore we shall be with the Lord.       18 Therefore be ye comforted together in these words. [Therefore comfort ye together in these words.]  The problem is that people were and are taught lies from birth. That Jesus will be 1000 feet tall and glowing and standing on clouds.

I am homeless and need help. I have documentation of 7 pages of things mankind has done to me in the last few years, to force me to be homeless. They are included here, but you may want to skip through them, because I want to bear witness of my father. Becky like many assumes that because a person is homeless they are liars, drug addicts, scam artists etc. I am the Christ, The guy above.  I will be honest; I almost cant lie about the Christ to those who I think are believers. I got set up and up set.! She wanted to talk to me about my being demon possessed, and I got offended. So I told her the truth I am the Christ, Becky, read Isaiah 53  Isaiah 53 (Darby Translation)  Isaiah 53   1Who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?    2For he shall grow up before him as a tender sapling, and as a root out of dry ground: he hath no form nor lordliness, and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.    3He is despised and left alone of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, and like one from whom [men] hide their faces; -- despised, and we esteemed him not.   At this point Becky and her husband began to imply that the following documentation can you help is my demon possession that it is the problem, I agree, but I think the demon is in the church still, because she cannot see the truth.  CAN YOU HELP?  This is the record of the crushing I have received to date.     John 8:18    I am, that bear witnessing of myself, and the Father that sent me, beareth witnessing of me.  This is the list it is a time line of events that are documented on this earth, and in heaven. Can anybody help me? Is there a Christian anywhere who has work I can do so I can move out of the weeds? The enemy has me homeless. I have over 20 years construction experience, most of it as a Forman, superintendent, project manager, estimator, and owner.

Suppose, for instance, a man understood the Prana perfectly, and could control it, what power on earth would not be his? He would be able to move the sun and stars out of their places, to control everything in the universe, from the atoms to the biggest suns, because he would control the Prana. This is the end and aim of Pranayama. When we become perfect Yogis, there will be nothing in nature not under our control. If we order the gods or the souls of the departed to come, they will come at our bidding. All the forces of nature will obey us as slaves. When the ignorant see these powers of the Yogi, they call them the miracles.     One peculiarity of the Hindu mind is that it always inquires for the last possible generalization, leaving the details to be worked out afterwards. The question is raised in the Vedas, "What is that, knowing which, we shall know everything?" (2) Thus, all books, and all philosophies that have been written, have been only to prove "that" by knowing which everything is known. If we want to know this universe bit by bit we must know every individual grain of sand, which means infinite time; we cannot know all of them. Then how can knowledge be? How is it possible for us to be all-knowing through particulars? The Yogis say that behind this particular manifestation there is a generalization. Behind all particular ideas stands a generalized, abstract principle; grasp it, and you have grasped everything.     Just as this whole universe has been generalized in the Vedas into that One Absolute Existence, and those who have grasped that Existence have grasped the whole universe, so all forces have been generalized into the Prana, and those who have grasped the Prana have grasped all the forces of the universe, mental or physical. Those who have controlled the Prana have controlled their own minds, and all the minds that exist. Those who have controlled the Prana have controlled their own bodies, and all the bodies that exist, because the Prana is the generalized manifestation of force.     How to control the Prana is the one idea of Pranayama. All the trainings and exercises in this regard are for that one end. Every one of us must begin where we stand and must learn how to control the things that are nearest to us. This body is very near to us, nearer than anything in the external universe, and this mind is the nearest of all. The Prana which is working this mind and body is the nearest to us of all the Prana in this universe. This little wave of the Prana which represents our own energies, mental and physical, is the nearest to us of all the waves of the infinite ocean of Prana. If we can succeed in controlling that little wave, then alone we can hope to control the whole of Prana. The Yogi who has done this gains perfection; no longer is he or she under any power. The Yogi becomes almost almighty, almost all-knowing.     We see sects in every country who have attempted this control of Prana. In this country there are Mind-healers, Faith-healers, Spiritualists, Christian Scientists, Hypnotists, etc., and if we examine these different bodies, we shall find at the back of each this control of the Prana, whether they know it or not. If you boil all their theories down, the residuum will be that. It is the one and the same force they are manipulating, only unknowingly. They have stumbled on the discovery of a force and are using it unconsciously without knowing its nature, but it is the same as the Yogi uses, and which comes from Prana.     The Prana is the vital force in every being. Thought is the finest and highest action of Prana. Thought, again, as we see, is not all. There is also what we call instinct or unconscious thought, the lowest plane of action. If a mosquito stings us, our hand will strike it automatically, instinctively. This is one expression of thought. All reflex actions of the body belong to this plane of thought.     There is again the other plane of thought, the conscious. I reason, I judge, I think, I see the pros and cons of certain things, yet that is not all. We know that reason is limited. Reason can go only to a certain extent, beyond that it cannot reach. The circle within which it runs is very limited indeed. Yet at the same time, we find facts rush into this circle. Like the coming of comets certain things come into this circle; it is certain they come from outside the limit, although our reason cannot go beyond. The causes of the phenomena intruding themselves in this small limit are outside of this limit.     The mind can exist on a still higher plane, the superconscious. When the mind has attained to that state, which is called Samadhi-perfect concentration, superconsciousness- it goes beyond the limits of reason, and comes face to face with facts which no instinct or reason can ever know. All manipulations of the subtle forces of the body, the different manifestations of Prana, if trained, give a push to the mind, help it to go up higher, and become superconscious, from where it acts.|`|IaWlzcNsaa	The body allows the mind to be enlightened.  It is the spark that lights the fire.|`|QJwOhM0qaa	I've heard its the fast track way to enlightenment. That it is really the only reliable method in this age of degeneration that we live in.     The body and the mind must work together. Of course a healthy mind can make the body do things that will make it healthy but starting from a place where the body is not conditioned to accept enlightenment (so they say) the process could have detrimental effects. not only that, until your m ind takes control of the body ( a mind over matter thing) the unhealthy body will continue to subvert and confound the plans of the mind. Example: if you decide today that you want to participate in a triathlon you have to train for at least a year and very hard at that. If you were to try and take such a task on right away your body would fall apart on you.   Another aspect to consider is the affect certain chemicals not only produced in the body but introduced to the body have on the mind. If you exercise certain chemicals are released that give you a sense of well being or energy such as adrenaline. Also, there are the well known affects of proper diet and the euphoric affects of drugs and alcohol.   I'm not saying that the body CAN enlighten the mind but I really don't wholly see it as vice vera, either. I think the two work together, just as all beings must work together for true enlightenment to happen.|`|AA12391873	Yes... they enlighten each other...yet they are both temporary manifestations of the One and are not separate.|`|MzKTLRgpaa	Both, simultaneously... to wholeness. :-)    And as far as the buggy and the horse go... i just stick the key in the horses ignition, fire up the rocket-boosters, and ride the electric-buggy up the spine of love! (gosh i love imagery! lol) ;-P|`|nQW1MSMpaa	Neither. If you are looking for enlightenment you will not get it from either the body or the mind, you will only get it from the soul.    Your body has all those physical needs like food, water, sex, etc, that need to keep it going. The mind has all those thoughts going on that make the body feel emotions. The mind is like a ticker-tape with thousands of thoughts screaming past every minute, your mind stops on a thought, then starts to chew on a thought and attaches an emotion or emotions to that thought.    It is the capacity to have thoughts without attaching emotions to them that leads to enlightenment. To listen to the still quiet voice within, to understand that we are all the same. That we all choose the paths that we are leading, and that even if it isn't the path that we would have chosen for someone, it is their right to choose it for themselves. That we have to go through life choosing love rather than judgment.    These are the things that lead to enlightenment. So take some time out to meditate and find that still quiet voice within and listen to your soul.
Gc49JgoQaa	Social phobias or disorders are not usually something you can control or change with mere thought processes or research - unlike religion or philosophical viewpoints.    I have a fear of public speaking even though it is irrational, and although I can manage it, I know I will never be able to fully get over it with mere rationality.    Unless the specific religion is intertwined with a deeper fear or psychological problem (which is sometimes the case) then it is usually not the same type of issue.|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	Clearly these atheists don't even understand that denying the possibility of a creator is illogical.

Since atheists claim to be so intelligent and logical, they violate their own belief system every time they say "there is no God."    I don't like arguing with atheists.

The problem with this chivalry thing is that now- a- days we as parents are to busy working and paying the bills that we are not taking the time to teach our young-men to love & respect the young ladies as they should.

As far as the name  Dracula is concerned it is just a name he came across while doing  research  http://www.litgothic.com/Authors/stoker....

A good deal of them are usually discovered to be having same-sex relations secretly, or who admit to slipping or regressing into past behavior.  But there are some who, on outward inspection, are successful.  The only problem is that we cannot see into their minds- are they happy?  Do they still have same-sex desires that they ignore?  We don't know, and therefore it's hard to judge.    I have never met anybody who has been able to consciously change their sexual orientation, especially if they do it because they don't like who they are.    In terms of the Greeks and Romans, I do think that socialization has something to do with it, and also a different attitude towards beauty (wherein male beauty was something much more prevalent than it is today).|`|7RFkBAZJaa	It's called supression. or  they go through an exploration phase and their parents make them go to the counceling and over time they do realize it was a phase and they were straight the whole time.  many gays also go through a similer thing and come right back to who they were before|`|fdkegbwgaa	I have heard people say that, but I think it is repression and I think it is very dangerous and unhealthy.

I think that those who repudiate the right of others to choose are small, ignorant people who refuse to recognize that a lot of things are possible in this wonderful, diverse world. if sexuality is so unchangeable why is yahoo answer full of gay guys asking how to seduce a straight guy all the time?
cNniG2L0aa	"We are talking about women choosing to have sex with a man not wearing a condom."  Oh, the simple life of an anti-choicer.    They are just willing tools of the religious right driven by misogynistic wrinkled old men.  There is not one thing I can think of more barbaric than forcing a woman or young girl to gestate unwillingly.  IF men could become pregnant abortion would NOT be an issue.  ~|`|AA12383652	No    A woman is ultimately responsible for not getting pregnant.  Like so many prochoicers like to say, its her body.  Well take some responsibility for it then.    Any woman that is dumb enough to have sex without protection needs to deal with the consequences and not put those consequences on the life of the baby she wants to kill.    Its not rocket science how not to get pregnant!      edit  and I have no problem being called anti choice in this abortion debate  I dont believe anyone should have the legal choice to commit murder of an innocent person.    I am a proud anti choice person!    gawd  Majority of abortions have nothing to do with health problems.  That is a separate issue altogether.  I think a woman has a right to do what she needs to in order to protect her own life, however, that isnt what we are talking about.    We are talking about women choosing to have sex with a man not wearing a condom.  A woman can refuse to have sex if the guy refuses to wear protection.  A woman can protect herself from unwanted pregnancies in many many many diff ways on top of refusing to have sex with a man without a condom.    If you are a woman and you dont want to have a baby then take the necessary steps to make sure you dont get pregnant but if you do not insist on those steps then dont blame the guy for getting you pregnant.  A woman has complete control over whether or not she gets pregnant in 99.9 percent of consentual sexual situations.      Men cant force a woman to have an abortion.  Having consentual unprotected or under protected sex and having an abortion is 100% the choice of the woman!      edit  is personal responsibility just not part of our society anymore???????      edit  You are taking a tiny percentage of the debate, that most people dont even argue about, and trying to turn it into the norm.  The OVERWHELMING majority of abortions are by selfish woman that dont want to be inconvenienced by a baby.  It has nothing to do with health issues of the mother or the baby in most abortion cases.    What exactly are you debating here right now because I thought the question was about the responsibility of the man in an abortion??????????    You are switching the debate into something that I wasnt even debating.      edit  My comments about personal responsibility of the woman was directly related to my answer of your question about if a man should be forced to have a vasectomy.    I said no, a man shouldnt be forced to have one, because the ultimate responsibility of getting pregnant and the final choice to have an abortion rests pretty much solely on the woman.    Personal responsibility of the woman was my reasoning for why men shouldnt be forced to have a vasectomy.  I was answering your original question.    What does your question and my answer have to do with cases where the mothers life is in danger?????  The question was about forcing men to get vasectomies or not for encouraging or supporting abortions as a result of his own negligence.   or that is what I thought the question was        Everard  You are so full of yourself.  Pretty much every negative stereotype you throw onto Christians is pretty dang funny because you are the atheist version of the narrowminded holier than thou condescending Christian.  You are exactly everything you bash on the other side and everytime you bash a Christian for acting a certain way you are condemning yourself.    Yes its pretty simple.  You dont want to get pregnant, as a woman, then make sure you protect yourself because you, as a woman, will  have to deal with the consequences of unprotected sex.    Its pretty dang basic and the fact that more women dont get that is the reason why there are so many unwanted pregnancies.    Its liberal elitist snobs like you that are ruining this country because you want find every reason why people shouldnt have to take responsibility for their own actions and use your own hatred and prejudices against people you think are beneath you to make an issue something that it just is not.  There are not many layers to this issue.  A woman either takes responsibility when having sex, or she doesnt.  Its not the mans fault that a woman has consentual sex unprotected.    Some things in this life are simple.  You dont want to get pregnant then you dont have sex, you make sure the guy is wearing protection and/or you make sure you are taking the necessary steps to not get pregnant yourself.        Zilla  I still dont understand how your personal situation applies to the question you asked, though.  (please dont direct any comments I made twds everard at you)|`|UI8svdFZaa	That really depends. If they are using abortions as a contraceptive then yes. However, if the abortion took place because of an urgent health issue or the contraceptive that was used failed and they were in no way ready, both mentally and financially, to raise a child then no.|`|1cf043a3a9ab83f394dc727e4871340caa	That's not even on a par with the antithesis you are using as a basis for your question... no one is asking any girl who had become pregnant to be sterilized.... go take some lessons in logic and reason and get back to me...    by the way, anti-choice is a poor term to use in defining those of us who defend the baby's right to life. A baby is not part of its mothers body, and it has its own DNA to prove it.    Any thinking person believes in the "right to choose" up to the point where it interferes with another person's life; so when  a woman chooses to engage in sex, that is a matter of her choice! And if the woman has a piercing, that also is about her own body, or if she decides to get a tatoo... but NOT when there is a new person developing within her... then it is no longer about her alone...|`|oKAFHgscaa	I don't agree with our tax dollars being spent on them to have another abortion if that's what you mean... Not once not 3 times, not ever.  They can have the abortion with their own dollars... or are you suggesting they stop spending our tax dollars on the abortions after 3 times? But instead pay for humans to be spayed & neutered, like we do with cats & dogs?  If they do not choose this as an option but persist in continually getting pregnant & getting abortions then the government put a limit on the number of abortions to three...  Interesting.  I'd say this is better than endless abortions on our tax dollars.  But If you're suggesting hold them down & force an operation on them...  No, I would not be in favor of doing this to anyone... but putting a limit on the number of tax funded abortions per person, most definitely...

Don't be fooled.....Jehovah does not accept all religions,as some go totally against His Laws, and practice and teach whats popular,and what people want to hear.

He also said that He would give this piece of land to Abraham and his descendants."    If God had forgotten about Israel, why was Moses born before He remembered about his covenant. I think sometimes we forget our promises, but God does not indeed forget His promises, but rather He wants us to ask of Him. IN Matthew Jesus tells his disciples to ask of the Father. And later he relates the instance of asking to a parable, in which he ended it with, "you do not have because you do not ask". I believe God was prompted to secure His people's release because their suffering cries reached him. Or it could also be that because of His covenant with Abraham, He chose to pity the Israelites. Because later we learn that these people whom groans God had heard were the ones who tested God in the wilderness by building a golden calf and groaning again, said, "It is better that we stayed in Egypt than come out here and die of thirst."|`|6bKws0fAaa	no He just reminds himself of it|`|MbCFe1odaa	ha ha someone is angry you just talked about their god!!!^^^^|`|snj9zznvaa	The invisible and the non-existent look very much alike|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	No.|`|AA11992885	teapot agnostic, my invisible friend is stronger then your imaginary friend...............lol|`|31fDBuLjaa	If He's omniscient, no.

Is. 43:25  WHEN GOD FORGETS  http://jlfoundation.net/godforgets.html                Does God forget about our sins after they have been genuinely confessed and repented of, and we have been forgiven? Many people believe that He does, but I say that He does not. Let me explain. Because He is God, He does not forget. However, there will be a time when God will most definitely forget about our confessed sins and will not hold them against us ever again.     Many of Jesus' parables start out with "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto..." Matthew 13:24, for example, says "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seeds in his field." Another parable says "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed" and still another parable says "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls."     By reading these short parables, we get a glimpse of what the kingdom of heaven is like and the principles that are in place. This Bible study is based on the parable of Jesus found in Matthew 18:23-35 which likened the kingdom of heaven unto a certain king. Here's the complete text.       "23. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.     24. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.     "25. But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.     "26. The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.     "27. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.     "28. But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.     "29. And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.     "30. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.     "31. So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.     "32. Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:     "33. Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?     "34. And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.     "35. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."|`|bKjJtSRPaa	When we accept Christ as our Savior and our sins are covered by his blood, God does not remember them anymore. So yes, God can forget - when He wills it.|`|UmxxBr6uaa	God remembers all his promises and forgets all sins he has forgiven.    Isaiah 43:25 says, "I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more."  Psalm 103:12 says, "As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us."    Also, Hebrews 6:10 says, "God is not unjust; he will not forget your work."    He remembers the promises he keeps and the things we do for him. God will forget all our sins once we have placed our whole life in his hands.    When Exodus says he "remembered" it doesn't mean he forgot about his covenant. It means he heard the cry of his people and recalled his promise.    And btw, God didn't need the rainbow to remember his promise. God uses the rainbow so we will remember his promise.|`|AA11648578	God is speaking to men as such he conveys a message in a way that man can understand. When it says God remembered it demonstrates that God provided for them according to his promise. God answers their prayers. Why do you think we pray, it is not becase God wasn't paying attention to our needs but to ask God to answer our request.    I love the verses that God repented he made man.  God of course can not regret can he?  No God again is conveying a messege..If it truly repented God that he had made man then Noah would not have been saved.  God is conveying a message about sin and about man at this particular time in man's creation..Lets look at it this way God is all knowing and foreknows the end of everything..  So God knows at this time of sinful man that the end result of man is a perfect man..a man that is made perfect by God.  But he is conveying at this point in man's creation man is exceedingly sinful and at this point it repents God that he has made man...He is not truly repented by man because he knows the end result is a perfect man perfected through Christ.  God knew before he made man that man would sin..and God's plan was to make man perfect before he created man.  So while man is sinning God can say he is sorry that he made this man...conveying to us that if this was the end result we would not exist..God's plan for man is to make a perfect man and it will be done. This is the reason Noah found grace in God because mankind is spared for God's plan to perfect him through Christ.    As far as man being sinners...Absolutley we ALL are sinners.  And this is a fact..and it is also a fact that sin separated man form God.  God is not joined to sin.  This separation from God is death. God created and sustains our life..  ALL men sin and all men die.  This is the reason the son became flesh to overcome temptation, sin and death as a man under law.    Do you think God gave man the law thinking a man could be perfect under the law?  NOOOOO God foreknew man would sin and has a plan of salvation for man.    Man repented God when we sinned but God revealed ot man his sin by the law. God also revealed to man that sin is corruption that causes death.    God foreknew man would sin and that man would inherit death but God loved his creation and provides the way to bring man to his righteousness.  Satan lied to Eve in the garden he told her she wold not surely die.  It was to say God is nto righteous and that God would make another deal  This is where the Qu'ran agrees with Satan.  The Qu'ran teaches that if you do more good than bad God will consider you good..that is the first lie Satan told.  God will not overlook sin and he does nto weigh sin all sin is bad.  God's plan is nto to overlook sin but to being you to his righteousness..for eternal life.  Life is eternal because there is no sin and corrption disease and death.  God brings you to his righteousness .  He makes you new.  This was always God's plan.    God gave man the law not so the law would make a man perfect..the law has never made one man perfect.  God gave man the law to show man he was a sinner and that God is righteous and to demonstrate to man his need for God.|`|baa66b59e6b11b480fe4ea1ae7a6a6c8aa	God does not forget, neither does God remember.  God already knows everything so why would God need to remember something.  People only need to remember things due to time passing by and our ability to store the memory in our brain.  Now remember this 1 little fact, our bodies do replace themselves cell by cell over a 7 year period approx. now if this was the case with God then there is a reason for memory, though this is not the case.  God is the Alpha, the Omega. God always was and always will be.
2a16a948aee20ae878dae8776bca92cfaa	in this situation, especially w/the time its been, i would really hope for the best, but also prepare for the worst. you dont know if he has moved on and has a man that he truly loves, you really dont know. i would write him and not be all lovey dovey at first, since its been so long, i would be like, "hey i got ahold of you and i would like to know how you are doing since these past years. here is my number, im interested in all your life success and adventures so far since then."  and when he calls you, you will know.  if you have his address, i would just call him. you can go to 411.com and do a reverse adress lookup and call him. that would be better than a letter. there is so much more in hearing a persons voice than a simple letter. if not, i hope the letter does work out and i hope it does work out for what you want. feel free to email me, i would love to hear about the turnout|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	I would send him the letter and include your contact info.  This way if he wants to get in touch he can.  I would not call him, it may freak him out.  If you want to make sure he gets the letter send it certified mail.  I am so happy for you, atleast you have a way to reconnect if you want.|`|c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	Been there.....  I met the love of my life 15 years ago.  We fell in love and moved in together.  After living happily for 3 years, we came upon some hard times, financially, and had to go back home to our respective parents houses.  Well, he blamed me for everything and held this grudge for 5 years.  During that time we saw each other occasionally, and were polite to each other, but never reconnected.  Finally, I met someone else, and tried to move on.  That relationship became abusive and I moved home again.  My first love found me to ask for some money, and ended up spending the night.  We reconnected, and have been together ever since. So fairytale ending really do exist.       My advice to you would be to write that letter, include what you wrote to us and let him have your contact information.  He may not be immediately available, but if he knows you are there for him, he may make himself available.  You'll have to trust in God to put you back together.  After you send that letter, the ball will be in William's court, so if he gets back to you ...it's meant to be, if he doesn't, don't waste your life wondering what if?  Go out there and make something better.|`|P3JsbI7gaa	i didnt read all the answers but i did read daoies and i agree u should not ask him about his love for you, just let him know whats going on and send ur email address and/or phone number cuz snail mail is the worst, it takes forever. best of luck to you!|`|rlayqcGjaa	Let him know how you feel.  If he dis-respects you or has found someone else don't bother. You will find someone much better than him because there is always someone else that is better for you. Don:t get caught up on just one person just live out your life and  find someone for you please.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	wow, I've been looking for someone since 1979.   A much as I want to talk to her, I am nervous too.   Just be honest, you've been thinking about him, hoping he's ok, curious about his life. You never know. He may tell you he's been in a long time relationship, so getting back in touch would be not in your best interest. He may tell you, he's single and is glad to hear from you and hopes you're single at this point.   You never know. Don't count on anything so you won't get hurt again.   If you go into it with an open mind and no expectations, you'll be OK. I wish you the best. Regarding the address, make sure it's really him. Write a short note, nice and light, just letting him know you were thinking of him and hope he's fine. Not too personal as he may be involved and his partner might see the note.     Would love to hear how it works out.  My best to you|`|LxgykSqGaa	Well, I have a lot of friends that have reconnected on Facebook.  Really surprising.  all the people I used to hang out, are now e-friends.  Kinda wierd.    anyway, the point is, go ahead and contact.  People love hearing a voice from the past.  But don't think you can jump right in where you left off.  Time has changed who he is and who you are.      he might be married (to a man or a woman).    It might not even be the same guy!  but don't get a stalker-ish on him.  That's bad.  Just a nice card to say hello and find out what's been going on, is a good way to begin.|`|fdkegbwgaa	Hi hun  Well to be honest I think you have said a lot on here that you could put in your letter!  I would go for it as the worst that can happen is a rejection isn't it?  Life is far too short to waste so I would defo go for it hun!  Tell him how you feel just like you have told us.  You never know it could be the start of something beautiful.  It may not but if you don't try you will never know  Good luck XXX|`|HxbEnNLQaa	For Pete's sake, drop him a letter or call him...tell him you are thinking about him and wonder how he is! I cannot imagine him not being happy to hear from you...do not be surprised if he has his own life now, but any contact is fine. If nothing else, revive the friendship. Stop being a coward and get out the pen and paper. Goldwing|`|g6cUQFuCaa	dude if u still love him u gotta right him that letter and start talking again|`|r6fGmJK1aa	I am in the same position, I had a friend about 20 or more years ago, and lost contact with.  I was searching, and researching, and found some online tools and such.  I know where he used to live, and found an address in SoCal.  I got so excited.  Then my heart sank, and I found the same person died in 1994.  Same name, age, and location. So I am sure it is him.    If you have a name and address, it should not be that much more difficult to find a phone number.  I think you should try any means possible to find him and contact him. You may never be able to get back the love you had, but lord knows we can sure use more friends.      Good Luck, I wish you all the best. Go find him.|`|J1XwqvLGaa	Okay, this is how I feel about this situation.     Write the letter, but don't just go bursting and asking about if he ever carried the love for you all those years. Start out with something simple. Remind him who you are. And simply ask him how's he doing. Then write what's been happening on your side of the world. Hopefully this gets the conversing started between you two again. I think there will be a time when you just know that it's appropriate to ask. I don't think you'll get an honest answer right away if you two don't reconnect on a level. So, tell me what happens, and if you ever write and send the letter. :)     *hugs*
HJ92WYWVaa	in my case i would have said your boyfriend should take care of the arrangement but since you want an advice, call him up to come over rather than for you to go. find a great site for this season in a secluded area that can be romantic just for the both of you, then cook up something seductive you did give to him that will make him always remember this day(in your mind)

ZuzSUymFaa	Well let's see:  Farting is a natural human thing to do which is necessary for comfort.  Smoking anything, unless it's prescribed by a doctor, is detrimental not only to one's own health, but to those around the smoker in terms of second-hand smoke.  In addition, the fart smell will dissipate after a few seconds, whereas smoke smell can linger in one's clothes, the air, and on one's breath for a very long time.  So not only is it fair to compare, but one can't help but to do so.  It may be open to debate as to which is more offensive (especially if the farter had something particularly stinky to eat), but a good rule of thumb for both "offenses" is to fart OR smoke away from others who may be offended.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	no ..... smoking is a matter of choice whereas Fart is a unstoppable process :)|`|83ftA09Paa	Until they make fart-scented tobacco, farting will be more offensive.  .|`|AA11198190	No way.....  l would never be offended by someone farting or smoking  near me.....

As for the sight its all very sophisticated advertising for the movie 2012 coming in November.  If you click on the privacy policy at the bottom of  the IHC website it takes you to Sony pictures website.

Conor C.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Should Christians be witnessing to others if they themselves have little understanding of the bible?    The first Christians had no bible.  This is hardly a prerequisite.      2) If so many Christians can disagree over so much of the bible, should they be witnessing to others?    Of course.  What has agreement on Scriptural interpretation to do with it?      3) How can you spread the word of God if you don't know or understand it?    What is spread - normally - is the gospel, which is a very specific and relatively brief portion of the word of God.  It also predates the bible by about 300 years.  Do you think the apostles were handing out bibles?      4) Every question asked of them has multiple answers that contradict each other so why are you spreading disinformation?    I don't understand this question.      5) yet they don't even understand the rule book they presume to tell me I should be following    Ahhh!  NOW I understand!  What is spread - or is supposed to be spread - is the gospel.  The "rules" of the bible are for believers, not for unbelievers (obviously, I would have thought).  The part of the bible that is for unbelievers - the ONLY part - is the gospel, the good news that reconciliation with God is available through Jesus.

I believe in God and Christ - and I believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God - however, like Chinese Whispers, I think that somewhere along the line there have been translational errors.      Then, there are the out and out changes made by the Roman Catholic Church whose Pope's believe that God gives them permission to change whatever they like - including the 10 Commandments and the day of Sabbath worship.    I think as a Christian, you can only witness to the aspects of how God, Christ and the Bible have changed your life personally - but I don't believe people should try to talk about things they have no idea about.    The fact that Jehovah's Witnesses go around doing what they do is scary, considering they only go by their own Bible - and that has been altered; they're not allowed to read any other sources of information and they actually contradict themselves and the Bible.    Most Churches are apostate anyway; offspring of the RCC and therefore illegitimate.  The point is, if you're a Christian, you will know this and know that Satan is behind all the fake churches in the world, gathering millions to their doom.    Thank goodness for free thinking and the ability to get away from organised religion.|`|ri44yISWaa	No, they shouldn't.

Some christians have it, and some dont, and sumtimes the ones that dont think they do and try to teach. this can be dangerous. Normally ppl arent sent out to witness or teach anything unless their pastor or minister etc. know that they are able to adequately witness and have full comprehension of the word. For some, the bible is hard to understand, however for some of us it is not. I read the book a lot and find it very easy to read and am not baffled by anything often, for the answers can be found in the word! I am almost never confused about anything in the bible. Me being able to do this comes from the spirit itself! But yup u are rite, that is why there is division amongst us now, that is why it is soooo important to study for yourself so u can know exactly what is in the book. You have no idea how much stuff i found out was a myth when i started studying for myself! besides, its just not cool to be blindly, led.|`|UlQEgJrDaa	Well firstly, you must have ALL the answers and knowledge of the Bible, to make such a judgement ! Do you?  Secondly, who did Jesus call to be his disciples...were they the Pharisees or were the Jewish Religious Leaders, and who thought they knew everything (like some of the clergy today) ?  Or were they simple men, some of whom were fishermen.,?  So these men didn't have a high education, but they had the right heart condition,and so the Holy Spirit was able to work on such ones.  My question to you is.....Who do you think God approves ( the answer is in the bible) of...the people with a good education or those whose heart condition is right.?   Actually the Bible doesn't ever contradict itself, its only mans understanding that is contradictory.  Where do you think the best education of Gods word comes from, is it from man, or from God, who uses His Holy Spirit? Look into your Bible, it holds all the answers.|`|czpbpm0daa	Agreed that those who dont understand should not preach but understand as well those who do witnessing must learn by being in the feild, just like any other learning process the best way is by conducting. Irregardless of that did you notice how many fanatics took this question and blew it up into a vendetta lol, otherwise as far as religions goes the bottom line is everyone is right..... which also makes everyone wrong :) think on it:)|`|mOgdarRIaa	i agree with jaisen m. i think there were human elements included in the bible which caused confusion.|`|uZ1KX3v4aa	Witnessing is generally not the same as biblical/doctrinal education and/or discussion.  Witnessing is simply the sharing of the message of salvation and how the person sharing it came to faith.  I don't need to have a wide knowledge of the bible to understand what sin is, that I have committed sin, and that I need the sacrifice of Christ to be reconciled to God.      Witness is also used as a noun sometimes, as in, "If I stayed around Y!A much more than I have, my witness would be ruined because I'd be unable to hold my cyber-tongue."      I realize that's not exactly what you're talking about, but I wanted to clear that up.  Now on to the matter at hand....    It is infuriating in the extreme to see so many doctrines, the majority of which are silly and utterly baseless (when taken into account with the whole of Scripture and not one or two verses).  We are supposed to be ONE body - the body of Christ.  Jesus said we would be known by our love for one another.  No wonder nobody 'knows' the church anymore...    The facts of the matter are these: the average Christian could not go directly to any given book of the bible when asked.  This is sad and directly contrary to the Word...which they have no idea about because they don't READ it.  The average Christian cannot give you sound reason and reference for what they believe (doctrinally).  The average Christian is woefully ignorant of the common questions asked by non-believers and how to answer them.  The average Christian has NO CLUE about the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount, which would have prevented at least one of the answers you received here.    Taking these things into account, the average Christian should not attempt to engage anyone in a doctrinal discussion.  In Acts, the Bereans were mentioned as ones who heard the message being preached then SEARCHED the Scriptures to make sure it was true.  I doubt very seriously that everyone in the church at Berea was a scholar.  You do not need to be a minister or even have a college education to understand the Scriptures!  Peter was a fisherman.  John was a fisherman.  And yet these were among the men JESUS chose to spread the Word.  They were not educated men.  They were average Jews, but they were faithful and ready to be used in any way God so chose.  They were willing to put in the time and effort it took to do it right.  Would that modern day Christians would deem Jesus worthy of the same commitment.|`|ulmKkjbXaa	I completely agree with you.  That is why it is more important than ever to focus on the Bible...and nothing else.  We are strongly commanded in the Bible to be witnesses of Jesus Christ. As Christians, we can't ignore this call to evangelize the world. It's not only our obligation; it's also our moral duty. People are spiritually dying all around us, and it is criminal for us not to offer them the cure.    Matthew 9:37-38 (New Living Translation)  37 He said to his disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers are few. 38 So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields.

It was God's plan to smite Him, Christ also knew, as with His stripes are we healed. The prophesy of Isaiah had to be full filled, which also was the inclusion of the gentiles. The Jews rejected him for our sake, so that we could receive mercy, Now we have to show mercy to ward them. It was part of God's plan. Do you know that when the fullness of the gentiles comes in, The Lord will return to the Jewish nation. You have free will to accept Christ as Lord and Saviour and believe on Him and His Word, or you can reject it. The rest of the passage is about how the christians were persecuted and they pray to have boldness even during persecution to spread the gospel.|`|AA10351261	God can't go against His own will & His own word.  Example: It's the will of God that we don't steal. In fact it's a commandment not to steal. God isn't going to command people not to steal but then make/force them to steal anyway.People steal on their own accord.    It works the same way with your question.|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	Yes, I have struggled with this idea myself.  I began studying it and wound up with about 10 influences on us:  God, Luck, Nature, Nurture, other people, free will.  And yes, free will is one of the influences.  It's difficult to quantify it and truly it is even quite difficult if not impossible to even prove that free will exists.  Many people believe that free will is an illusion and I can't argue with them.  It's been a philosophical question for many centuries.  But for the sake of my own sanity, I must accept that it must exist in some fashion.  After all, what kind of a good God would send people to hell if they couldn't control what they did, including accepting Jesus gift of eternal salvation?    My response was to distill the definition of good and evil into free will.  What I have determined is that the measure of an act is its effect on the universal level of free will.  If your decision prevents someone else from having the free will to act, then your decision is an evil one.  Cut someone else off in traffic? They HAVE to react or they crash.  Your act was evil.  Steal from someone?  You limit the money/things they have and in turn affect the decisions they can make with the money/things they would have had if you hadn't stolen from them.  Murder someone?  You most certainly affect their free will.  Abortion?  YOU BET you are limiting an entire LIFEtime of free will.  This is why all sin is equivalent in God's eyes.  All evil acts affect free will and begin a chain reaction down the line.  You cut someone off in traffic.  They have to slam on their brakes.  The person behind them has to slam their brakes on.  On and on down the road and you have affected the free will of dozens of people.  Even more if you have caused an accident.    So, how can man have free will if we are predestined?  Well, Adam and Eve were not predestined to eat the forbidden fruit.  But God knew that they were going to do it.  Maybe not an answer, but it's food for thought.  haha.  Pun not intended.|`|eb38abe11698b46fde324034db87a709aa	I have free will because I am too stupid to know what God is going to do next, fore planned or not, and being so stupid and skeptical concerning my own ability to defend my self against fraud, I can not be certain as to who God is, if and when he reveals Himself (or Herself or whatever; what would God do with a penis anyway, **** Himself?).|`|3KXBzSzfaa	I was somewhat confuse by your last question.  But my answer is sometimes you have to take your seat on what is coming to you whether it be good or bad.  Personally if its bad I'll try to avoid it.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	Simple.  Free will doesn't exist.    edit: that passage implies that God made the choice, not his creations.  I do believe it is possible for God to predestine something and for that creation to willfully agree with God's plan.  Anything that disagreed would simply not be created.  If that makes sense.|`|4boTYkt7aa	God knows what will happen,but He gives us choices.He knows which choice we will make.|`|bKjJtSRPaa	This passage is talking about Jesus, his birth and everything that would happened to him had been predetermined by God basically as a test, to see if Christ was worthy of Him. Christ had to fulfill all 109 prophecies about the Messiah, therefore he knew the path he had to take before he ever came to earth. He took them anyway.     As far as salvation goes, I do not believe anyone is predestined to be saved. We are predestined "in Christ" which means it is the natural order of things that when we accept Christ we become like Him.    Think of it this way. When I get on a plane going to France, then I'm predestined to go to France. It's the same with us. Once we become believers, then we are predestined become more like Him because of all He's done for us.|`|UmxxBr6uaa	First of all, these verses have nothing to do with the Calvinist view of predestination. These verses are referring to the prophecy that Jesus would be handed over to to be crucified. (You can also refer to Acts 2:23; 3:18. These three passages are linked.)    The talk about predestination has been going on for centuries and is still a widely debated topic. Protestant Christians (and I believe Catholics as well) don't generally believe in the idea of predestination. That is a Calvinist view. To read more on predestination, you should look in Romans 8:28-39.    My personal belief is that we all have a choice. God doesn't make us do anything; we are free to choose. But I do believe that God knows before we are even born whether we will be saved or not.|`|yqUgRG2raa	All I can say there is a path. An abused child may grow up and abuse their children but at some point an individual will come along and say, I will not be like my parents" and following generations will be reared with love. This is a part of the "turn the other cheek" or turn the events toward greater nobility. We are in search of the path. "Follow the yellow brick road".|`|QMbaeva9aa	They're not mutually exclusive.   Predestination means you are "fated" to become a believer, since God knows the future and knows you will believe.   Free will means you can still choose whether or not to - God just happens to already know what you will choose when given the choice.|`|1cf043a3a9ab83f394dc727e4871340caa	Here's another one for you...

The lack of a quick response by your friend to her online friend is proof that she is not an experienced lesbian. Otherwise there would have been no hesitation.

An atheist actively disbelieves in the possible existence of a supreme being/creator/god by definition.    A christian actively believes in the existence of their supreme being/creator/god by definition.    Both are coming from an extreme viewpoint which by definition cannot be proven scientifically as they deal in belief.  After all science deals in understanding "how" things are done... religion deals in the concept of "who" did them.    The agnostic has a more scientific view than either to be honest, as they hold that the existence of the ultimate cause, as God, and the essential nature of things are unknown and unknowable, or that human knowledge is limited to experience.    After all any atheist claiming that they know for a fact that there is no such thing as god is actually just stating a belief.  Because after all they have not learned everything there is possible to know about the existence of the universe past/present/future.    But by the same token, christians claiming that there is in fact a god and it is the one of the bible, are also stating a belief.

Atheist's by-and-large have questioned what they believe and come to some kind of conclusion.    Another reason may be that the Christians trying to debate are inexperienced and don't know the issues even if they have questioned their own faith and believe with their whole heart.    Finally, most Atheist's can't accept the Christian argument of faith and see it as evading the debate as a whole. To Atheist's it may seem that way but to a Christian it's a true and real part of who they are.|`|4SFHGHyfaa	There are two types of arguments, well three counting a seldom used one  1. Emotional based  Usually instilled on a young child to believe a set of rules or a religion, and to stay away from it would be HORRIFIC, so it becomes apart of them, and turns into a emotion, So without logic they blindly defend themselves which is only human nature.    2. logic based.  Generally used by atheists, Buddhists and other various none, demanding religions. This way of thinking says "how?" If you cannot prove how then it is flawed.    3. Socrates method.  The act of using questions as a answer and letting others speak, then questioning there beliefs. To do this can be considered rude, but is one of the best ways to learn self image, and self importance, which is discouraged in the country of ours, though it is needed to remain...sain =P      So generally atheists use "how?"(2) would god do that, or "why?"(3) would god do that, trying to use the human brain to figure out problems that have taken 4000+ years to even get CLOSE,  Around 337 bc (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle)was the first questioning of a religion, this is when we started to get close, I think that we are still many, many generations from figuring it out.  And Christian's use   "Because!"(1) It is apart of them, Inside them, good or bad it is something that means A LOT to them, and i personally am an atheist but  i think to challenge somebody Else's religion personally is HORRIBLE, Its like toying with there family's lives.  so to answer your question: Christan's have INSTALLED and ROCK SOLID beliefs that they won't give up, and atheists Refuse to let anything go without a why, how or what.  Both have flaws, but both have good arguments, but we can believe what ever we want, which is what makes this country so great :)|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Because the atheists online in forums like this one generally think they know everything about science, and then reject scientific truths like the prohibition on infinite causality, the archaeological record, the historicity of the person of Jesus, etc.    Most "online atheists" are smarmy, self-assured people who don't know or understand much of what they talk about, even while they adhere to arguments that were abandoned dozens of years ago in light of new discoveries.    They're generally not interested in discussion or rational debate.  In my experience, they've made up their mind and won't evaluate an argument on its own merits.    Interestingly, there are valid reasons to reject Christianity, and some very well educated scholars do so for a variety of reasons.  But usually those reasons are completely foreign to the online atheist crowd, who's mostly (judging from their answers) in the 15 to 25 year old range and hasn't yet been exposed to the error of their own arguments or the valid questions raised by theist philosophy.

I have done so many times.  The problem is that a lot of Christians haven't really studied or prepared their arguments.  As a former agnostic, and an inquisitive person, I sought a lot of answers on my own after I became a Christian (as an adult).      The main crux of the debate between Atheists and Christians is of origins itself.  Once you demonstrate that the big bang theory as well as evolution is full of holes and devoid of logic, you can at least demonstrate that it is a faith or belief system, and not science.  Science is valid and meaningful.  Science has brought us great many advances and conveniences we enjoy today.  However the acceptance of evolution and big bang by the scientific community as science is based solely on the beliefs, and that belief is based solely on the fact that it rules out God and the supernatural.      You can also demonstrate that the entire belief system is based upon presuppositions, not established facts.    This all came from a great deal of personal research on my own part over several years.  Some Christians do not have the time or desire to delve into the matter.  I did, initially for my own satisfaction, and later as a witnessing tool.  I am not saying I'm the world's best debater, but I feel confident enough to debate Atheists when challenged, and not be accused of "blind faith".

Then you'd have the right to ask and you would know for sure; or maybe you have some issues of your own? good luck.|`|MvmuZMG4aa	gay....  only when u said that if you asked him if his lover is a girl and he didnt answer.|`|ZJ6Nwbv3aa	Bismillahi Al Rahman Al Raheem  Ouzibillahi Mina shytan Al Rajeem  Bismillahi Al Rahman Al Raheem      Filth is filth no matter how you slick it!|`|5cJrnaQaaa	how about leaving him alone?!  did you ever think that maybe he's trying to keep it from you because he's worried you'll make a big deal out of it and make fun of him. But if he isn't gay...i'm sure he doesn't appreciate you making fun of how he acts.  who cares if he is...besides it's not like anyone here is going to be able to tell you..we dont know him!
7sIYGEnmaa	I don't think you're a racist and I think I know where you're coming from. A lot of people get a free ride using the "racism," "sexism," "homophobia," etc. cards when they are either too uneducated or simply refusing to face a certain fact. This fact may be truthful but shameful to them. Many real problems could be solved peacefully if we stopped misusing and exaggerating the term "political correctness."  I too dislike kids or adults who act like gangsters, and unfortunately, there are more Black people who act like this than Whites. Simply, because Blacks constitute the vast majority of rap artists and consumers. Rap in its 21st century form is mostly (but not always) promoting violence, depression, disrespect to women, and so on. Therefore I dislike those who interpret it that way and think it's fine. Rap in its current form is a problem and it is fueled and created mostly by Blacks. It's not a racism to point out a problem that is caused mainly by a certain group of people.|`|nE15oNjBaa	And? I don't think your being racist effects me either way.      I find that white people tend to be hypocritical, phony,  judgmental, mentally unstable and racist.|`|tRZ0DZtSaa	Perhaps you just dislike stupid people?|`|RutQ1BNsaa	I think you shouldn't link  the  behaviour with the color of people.They act by this way because of their age,lifestyle,education...|`|TMi1GhSHaa	and the ones that dont act that way are the minority of that race like me, personally I try  not to let it bother me and i act myself. I gravitate towards whites more..|`|6bKws0fAaa	now instead of looking at other people, look at yourself man, and think of all the dumb things you did in life, all the immature and nonethical and unintelligent things you've done    then stop thinking you are superior or that others are inferior   i do see how you get annoyed of them  but just think that you're not better than anyone  and no one's any better than you    but believe me i'm the same way sometimes  i get arrogant myself and I think like you sometimes  but it always helps to just ignore them and live your life and not worry about others|`|da4zS4AOaa	I think you just hate anyone with that "gangsta" behavior you described. Not necessarily a black person.     "now I notice I start to feel that way at work, or anywere, black people start to gross me out..." |`|SBF6jqlLaa	"My thoughts are that the majority are far less intelligent, less ethical, and just all out inferior" - you.     Yep, your racists. Like most other white men about your age. (your avatar looks old) Well, I dont know what to tell you, if you cant distinguish bad kids from adults, and seperate your feelings of dislike for teens towards a whole race of people, then...you are like most racists. You just needed a reason.|`|mnQXmZbeaa	it seems like the only way to get you out of that way of thinking is for you to be in a situation where you're around more "intelligent" black ppl. (easier said then done i'm sure) Its not really you b/c i'm black and i hate n*ggers. every culture has n*ggers we just call them something different. were not all like that so hate us! i get sh*t from my own ppl b/c i don't act that gangsta.|`|uQfJukisaa	You're not racist you are just generalizing all black kids. You probably live in an urban area where most of the black people are ghetto. Here in the suburbs black kids are well behaved and non-confrontational.|`|hfLISWNsaa	not racist really...kids about my age of this generation are generally immature. :/  it just happens that they're trying to go along with the trends of being hardcore.  the kids at my school are like that too.  at least, majority are.|`|VsamHLPOaa	You need to broaden your horizons and don't let a couple of bad experiences cloud your judgement. I think you have misplaced your anger. It shouldn't be directed toward black ppl but all ppl who portray those negative attributes that you have stated. Just remember that no one person is the same so what you experienced with some doesn't equate for all.|`|yynC47EMaa	I'm going to bet you are likely on some sort of behavioral medication or you should be.  The things you write about sound very similar to how Eric Harris felt almost identical, you really have an issue with most of humanity and that's an issue that is not going to just go away. You hate gangstas and black people who act that way, the truth is I would keep a very close eye on you and be aware of what you are doing around me. I'd be much more concerned of you snapping and going postal than I would be of Jerome wearing his do-rag and listening to Biggy.    Sounds like you live in a ghetto. If I lived in a ghetto I'd be pretty pissed off and mad at people too, you may want to consider a change in scenery before you either get your self hurt or you wind up in prison with a lot of ignorant racist black and mexican guys.|`|EXurNsB4aa	Well in short, yes, you are racist.  You acknowledge that you think racist thoughts and attribute single qualities to an entire group of people.  You only make exceptions for "intelligent" black people.  This is all racist.  I think you know that, and I hope you aren't OK with that.  Because you can work on changing it.    I just want to point out that when you are talking about your confrontations with people, the only common factor in your fights is YOU.  Even if most or all of the people you start fights with happen to be black people, you are the one common factor in your experiences.  Why do you think it's necessary to get into confrontations so often?  It seems like you feel like you have something to prove, especially since you mentioned people not being on your 'level'.    You can't let some bad experiences with a certain group of people taint your entire view.  Doing that is a shortcoming of your personality and way of thinking; not a shortcoming of black people in general.    I think you should do some real thinking about why you feel so strongly.  And why it seems that you jump to being aggressive so easily.  You don't connect your aggressiveness to your whiteness, do you?  Then don't connect it or any other individual quality to blackness.|`|Swmd0P2uaa	You are gonna get smeared for this question... but really, I understand where you are coming from. I started serving at a restaraunt and I wondered, how come most of my African American tables dont tip me, while other tables were more likely? Then I switched jobs, I encountered even HARSHER racism and it was absolutley horrible! The things African American women were calling me and threatening me with- were UNBEARABLE. (get this, I was just a costumer service rep!) It was uncanny, the number of African Americans that treated me so badly. (I try to be a kind person to everyone equally).      This was really a time of cognitive dissonance for me. Like you, I respect and admire many African American literaries, friends, etc. (Clarence Thomas for example) I was sincerely distressed and SAD at this point. I did not want them to treat me this way- and not just because it was so cruel, but because I worked so hard to welcome everyone with an equal feeling of belonging. I always hear preaching, that whites are opressive and holding blacks down.     Really... the only thing holding ANYONE down is themselves.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	obviously you arent as ethical and intelligent as you believe white people must be if you are starting fights with people because you disagree with the way they think and dress. If you disagree with a lifestyle that is one thing but you can not know a persons lifestyle by looking at their clothes to assume that you do is ignorant, Ah he's wearing baggy pants and dread locks he is surely a terrible thief and rapist.

AA10744085	According to the Jewish Scriptures; when someone is "slain", they fall face forward...not backwards. Also, "catchers"? If it's sincerely G-d...nobody will get hurt.  My honest opinion? I believe people are not accustomed to experiencing the manifest Presence of G-d, & when they encounter someone with a deeper relationship with G-d than they themself possess, they may experience "something". However, I have asked G-d that if this is legitimately of Him, then to please follow the principle established in His Word & cause me to go face forward. As of yet, not even Benny Hinn who prayed over me has caused me to be slain. I don't say that as any type of challenge, but to show that I'm open.|`|yJCdLNHwaa	It is my opinion that "slain in the spirit" means that you were alive in sin and you gave your soul to God and were reborn.

Like any other things christians do, it isn't something to be decided by PC,anti-christians,atheists and agnostics,or any other group that doesn't understand or like what is being done.  If someone wants to know if something is biblical about the Holy Spirit,or is done by christians,they need to make a true conversion (accept Jesus).|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	Catholics in the Charismatic movement also believe in this.

8Cz7ckXSaa	Haha, you are all wrong!    International Men's Day IS ALREADY HAPPENING. Its been happening for over 10 years and is celebrated in over 10 countries. See the Wikipedia entry on IMD here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internation...     There is a "global" IMD page here: http://www.internationalmensday.com/ for organizations or individuals who want to report celebrations of IMD they initiated in their own countries.     It's held on the 19th November every year and it rocks!    Q. Why do men now have an International Men's Day?  A  Because millions of people believe they deserve it!|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	You can celebrate International Men's Day. Pick a day, advocate for its recognition and celebrate it.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Lol please. You have to worship your queens okay? lol|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	There is no international men's day, because every day is international men's day. that is why there is an international women's day, and an equal rights bill.|`|45TGzqOxaa	Because for the longest time men have been in the spotlight, and women treated as the lesser sex.

j5uO9LL7aa	Prejudiced thoughts are often developed through experience.  Regrettably, the prejudiced thoughts my mind has developed over time through experience and the observation of patterns and trends continue to *collectively* prove themselves accurate.  As a consciously prejudiced individual, I will still deal with people on an individual level, and have met many that defy the collective tendancies of others like them, but the argument that I should dispel the survivalistic stereotypes my mind has developed through life experience and repetitive results is emotional, not logical.    I hope that I haven't disappointed you by not providing some uplifting change of heart scenario.  But I think those interested in these sort of topics should note that often it is maturity and experience that leads to certain viewpoints and prejudices, not maturity and experience that sheds them.|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	I have found that AG women who are lesbian can be very shy, sensitive, kind and warm.  They only have a rugged exterior and I know this because I have had several friends who are part of that lifestyle.  Often I assumed that the AG women would be always seeking dominance and be angry overly aggressive also. This is certainly not true.|`|UIhbK2xOaa	I used to think people of a certain race were ugly and annoying. I won't say which one because now I'm embarrassed. Then I remembered an early childhood experience that caused me to feel that way and the prejudice just went away.|`|XgejRqWsaa	I've never had an OMG I HATE THEM attitude toward an entire group, but i used to have a very arrogant outlook on people, for instance i'd think  "Why would anyone NOT go to college? It's the only way to be successful!"    "There's no reason for people to be poor! No one WANTS to be poor! If you're poor you're either 1. lazy or 2. stupid."    there was no miracle experience that shed me of those thoughts, just general growing-upery.     i'm not like that anymore AT ALL. complete 360 turn around.    sorry i don't have a more interesting answer for you lol.|`|KfkmB4X2aa	I used to think crapbags were uncool. Now I think they're totally lame.|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	I used to think Americans were so much smarter than the rest of us but after being on yahoo I have changed my mind.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	I used to think that minority groups really wanted everyone to be treated equally.|`|aILzgoK9aa	I used to pre judge all White people as being racist & evil & I actually hated White people for a long time because of that. It was during my 4th-5th grade years in school when there would be White kids who would mock me because I'm Asian. The kids would make faces at me by stretching their eyelids & making them look "slanted" & then they would sometimes say "ching chong". Then sometimes they would point at me & laugh or just bully me around, because I was always alone & very quiet. It really hurt my feelings. I cried alot in school & at home, my parents always asked what was wrong, but I never told them until I got older. It was during my Freshmen year when I had my breakthrough. I was always alone as usual & paranoid, until a little girl who turned out to be a Junior started talking to me & then befriended me later on. Before I met Sam, I always held a deep grudge against White people, but I believe because of her she helped me get over it. I felt ignorant because not all White people are like those kids.
ztb7OCvyaa	I agree with you. "Ghetto" simply refers to a neighborhood where people of a minority group live in high concentration usually as a result of social or economic pressures. Where I live there are Jewish ghettos, Asian ghettos, Latino ghettos, and even gay and student ghettos. We need to stop associating this word with blacks and crime.    And as far as what's stereotypically seen as "ghetto" behavior, I have seen people of all races act like that.    http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/g...  http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/web...|`|96AQZUGyaa	Well from what I've seen the majority of the population in an American ghetto is black. It is only natural then to view it as "black". So there's nothing to cry about, its just a fact.|`|jTkX9HJyaa	There are white ghetto people, mexicans, asians, indians. Every race has a "ghetto" classification|`|MbCFe1odaa	If I remember right Ghetto was a term for a Jewish slum or something????|`|tlUihEOvaa	Ghetto doesn't mean Black, I've seen Whites, Asians, and Hispanics speaking ebonics and sagging their pants in middle school.    Also why is being preppy considered White? Or conservative Asian?     Style or fashion is more of a cultural of personal thing not race.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	A ghetto is described as a "portion of a city in which members of a minority group live especially because of social, legal, or economic pressure.    The Irish immigrants of the 19th century were the first ethnic group to form ethnic enclaves in Americas cities, followed by Italians and Poles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Irish and Eastern European immigrants in the early twentieth century actually were more segregated than blacks of that era. Most Europeans lived like bannahs immigrants, the second or third generation families were able to relocate to better housing in the suburbs after World War II if possible|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	I don't either. I know many black people that act with dignity, pride and grace.|`|UKLdPLqTaa	I agree, it is despicable that being a minority automatically associates someone with poverty|`|OmDPJvo9aa	  Lmao, in my neighborhood, it means your part of town doesn't have sidewalks. (I never thought of ghetto as black, I always thought it was something that was busted or just poor. It's a mixed bag here, so color doesn't factor into it here.)|`|0VBESmFQaa	I agree with you 100%, All races and sex live in low income housing, I call it that because "Ghetto" i believe is a very disrespectful word in general, But on the flip side if you have ever listened to rap music or gangster rappers like snoop dog for master P and tupac ect they use this word a lot so in a way they coined the word|`|EXurNsB4aa	Well yeah, me too.  And I think that it's ridiculous when people anywhere try to act like they aren't "being racist against all Blacks-- just the ghetto ones".  It's a really stupid thing to say and it doesn't make them sound like less of an ignorant twit.    And in another way it just bothers me because too many people don't seem to understand what the actual word "ghetto" REALLY means.|`|nE15oNjBaa	I agree. I see plenty of people acting a fool    that are not of African descent.|`|ry2XcFm6aa	you ever been to a 3rd world country..? I've been to one so i sure know what ghetto is.....ghetto doesn't mean blacks no...|`|tusCN8zpaa	I know its stupid. Stereotypes really screw up people, and make them have to fight it off constantly.|`|672b5656d0344c959a7f6892a55f88ecaa	now ghetto means urban style|`|8oGTduFAaa	I agree with you, but most of the people i know do not classify ghetto as black, its mostly trashy/dirty, but thats also like people saying "white trash" all in all the same..dont  you think?|`|NwT6CpRUaa	i say ghetto often and it in no way means black. it means done the wrong way or the lazy way to me and my circle of friends. like my girlfriend and her friend got Chinese the other day and she wanted to eat while watching a movie on her computer. so she took a ironing board and used it as a table. then instead of eating off a plate she used the top to her container. to this i replied wow that is ghetto.     now as far as describing people Ghetto to me refers to the personality of the thug life group of kids. white or black.     so no i don't believe it should be defined as white or black    "a ghetto is an area, usually within a city, in which members of a particular cultural, ethnic, religious or national group live in high concentration, whether by choice or by force; "ghettoization" refers to the process of making an area into a ghetto" actual definition.

People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.

"For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature.Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting" - Romans 1:26-28      "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God." 1 Corinthians 6:9-11      Now alot of people think I'm close minded by believing the Bible, Ok your allowed to thing what you want...but it is pretty clear to me.. Also, I get alot of people telling me that I'm judgmental towards Homosexuals. I am not. I have had many close friends that are gay and family members. I love them all the same. I am NOT God, so who am i to judge? Also by saying I'm close minded before even talking to me...isn't that being judgmental?      But I believe what God says is true because I have seen it in my own life. The reason I posted this is because I have had a few people ask me where in the Bible does it talk about gays.      Also I've had people ask me "Why are you a Christian?"Here is my answer      "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."Romans 8:38-39      To me this means no matter what happens God will still Love me and that is the one sure thing I've had though out my whole life...      and this one      John 3:16      "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."|`|9741a3f7ecd87afb6df1b22885eb0f22aa	My Bible doesn't condemn anyone.  John 3:17 "For God did not send His Son to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him."|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	why would a church not accept a gay person. As long as liers, adulterers, fornicators, thieves, gamblers etc etc, are allowed to go in the church so should homosexuals! besides the church is a place for believers to congregate and worship and minister to the unsaved. SO basically the chuch should be filled with those afflicted with sin, no matter what sin it is, so that they can enter the bldg and get much needed medicine-the word of GOD!Allowing them to marry in the church is an abomination unto GOD!Man, as i read on, this post is filled with prejudices about gay ppl. all gays wealthy- yeah rite!|`|b2bMy1EAaa	The bible also says its ok to sell your children into slavery, women should do as men say etc they choose to ignore that, why not homosexuality?|`|6aIuZZi7aa	Obvious troll is obvious. Homosexuality is no worse of a sin than any other.|`|0PtGWx1paa	I know some Christian churches allow that.  Sadly homos are Catholics and the Church isn't provoking them enough.

Which makes sense, because way back when the Bible was written Egypt and Babylon used to buy (abducted) men to become eunuchs and sex slaves. So it was a big problem for ancient Israel, which was a weak nation compared to its giant slave-buying neighbours.    It does mention somewhere about not approving of men lying with men in general, but then it mentions gluttony at the same time, which kind of ranks homosexuals next to fat people in degree of sin.|`|clgc86Voaa	Your wrong. Read the Bible first because based on your question you have little or no knowledge of what its message is about. Second, the Bible does condemn homosexuals but it also condemns gamblers, drunks, false witnesses, adultery, murderers, etc. Theyre are some churches who do nothing but make money for themselves, but you forgot to mention the churches that shelter and feed the poor,and give money and things to other countries that need basic needs to survive.|`|FhHklqkhaa	"homosexual" was a term coined in 1869 so it can't be a sin or in the bible|`|1eb2a881ec04fac81a95b389b36cbafbaa	First let's define the word Christian, and go from there ok. To be a Christian we are to have a mind like Christ.So that being said, we are Christians. God forgives all sins, except blasphemy. We were born in sin so God gave his darling son's life for us, and with his stripes we are healed. As for the church part, the church is only a building, and the church should be within you. Society may accept many things, but on the day of judgement we will all be judged for the choices we made in this life. Judge not.. unless you want to be judged. For all of us have sinned and fallen from God's glory.The bible clearly states that God said that we are suppose to pay tithes and offerings(10% of our earnings) I suggest that you take time out of your busy schedule and read your bible and try to attend a weekly bible class. Then maybe you will get a personal relationship with God and stop pointing fingers because little do you know 4 more are pointing at you!! God bless you!!!|`|jK5FXm6Naa	Have you ever heard of a word 'compassion'?   The bible states it is wrong to lay with the same sex, but it doesn't say anything about judging these people or excepting them into our community.  We have a gay person in ours right now, she is just finding god and has realised she has a lot of sexual issues.  This girl is now in a loving family and is working through her homosexuality. Her path is with god, it's not for us to judge. All we are there to do is show her the right path and she can make her own decisions
Kbry7CnOaa	I see Jesus as a very enlightened man for his time, possibly he did perform some miracles, and he was a great thinker, who was rebelling against the rigid religious dogma of his time in search of the truth. I have little doubt he actually existed, and I admire him greatly.    But 2000 years later his word has become the very thing which he rebelled against. Twisted by the agenda's of a few, his teachings have become nothing but a guilt based religion whose way of thinking hasn't changed in 2000 years. I do not believe Jesus would want his word to stagnate, and I do not think he would approve of people in this era following the Bible in such a literal sense.    Don't get me wrong, the majority of Christians are great people, but I think they're lazy in that they are content to settle for the truth in the words of their pastor and the traditions of the church, instead of discovering God's true plan for themselves and this Earth. Or indeed the truth about God himself....|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	The concepts seem a bit odd to me but all religions different from my beliefs seem odd to me (I've never practiced any mainstream religion).    Christianity seems to vary a lot depending on the denomination.  I find the rituals of Catholicism very interesting.  I find the Quakers very simplistic and devoted to their community.  The Holiness sect of Pentacostals are interesting--my neighbors belong to that denomination.  I admire how the women dress so conservatively.  Regardless of how inconvenient their beliefs may make their lives, they stand true to their beliefs.  I respect that.  I can say the same for the Seventh-day Adventists that I've met.  I've known several JW's and they seem like friendly people.    I really don't know a lot about the religion of Christianity.  As I said before, their concepts are foreign to me.  That doesn't make them "bad".  It's just odd to me.  Then again, I could say the same about Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc.|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	My only disagreement with Christianity (or any other faith for that matter) is their claim to be the one, true way. I believe that spirituality or communion between human beings and our god(s) and goddesses is a very personal matter and best left to the individual. Paganism has afforded me the opportunity for direct communication without the need of a priest, rabbi, imam, or any other go between and to take responsibility for my own spirituality.|`|UNVJWxTmaa	I don't really think about Christians, unless they bother me.

Especially when they'd "like to talk to you about Jesus".      But, all in all, I don't generally have a problem with anybody's belief system.  It generally falls on the individual on whether I have a problem or not.  And to be fair, there are alot of Atheists who look down upon people for their beliefs and also try to impose their ideas on an individual as well as the public in general.|`|jlF3MEzmaa	I'm ok with Christianity, 95% of my friends are Christian, we get along very well.

They seek God in a book not in the heart. They seem to have placed limits on what the Divine can and cant do. They trust a book more then the Divine. I find it sad and i feel that they for the most part are well meaning, but they have been taught to fear to much and because of it they miss the chance to commune with the divine.

I'm not saying that I don't care about people, but I'm usually very tolerable about religious beliefs so christians are okay. It's actually when people question ME on why I have certain beliefs or why I don't believe in their god that angers me. Many people - christian, morman and others - alike do not like it when I pull the psycho-analysis on them as far as why THEY believe in god.

FKxrJxbPaa	lol Upper Middle Class??? ummm...thats hard.     Middle Class is easy...neighborhoods like Rosedale, Cambria Heights, Hollis, St. Albans and Springfeild Gardens are all predominantly Black communities that are economically stable, middle class, and safe.    Upper Middle Class is particularly hard because most Upper Middle Class minorities tend to move to white neighborhoods...or simply expensive neighborhoods, so although there are PEOPLE within black neighborhoods that are upper middle class they dont constitute their own community.    Also, Black and African American are not the same thing at all. Many, if not Most Black people in the NYC area aren't even African Americans, they're blacks from other regions such as Africa, Latin America & the West Indies.|`|wU0c3i7baa	To be honest, there aren't any neighborhoods in NYC that are both predominantly African-American and upper middle class.     Harlem has recently become more gentrified and you can find really nice apartments now. The thing is, the parts of Harlem that have become more expensive also have the most white residents.     Brooklyn Heights is a well off area in Brooklyn that has some upper middle class African Americans.     Generally speaking though, I think upper middle class African Americans just move to expensive neighborhoods that attract money regardless of race. The exception to this is the Upper East Side, which is one of the richest and least diverse neighborhoods.|`|4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	harlem?      hey i dont live in new york and thought that was a good neighborhood........|`|9DtJeAUKaa	none|`|EXurNsB4aa	Cambria Heights is in Queens, and it has a large middle class African-American population.

Unlike how some idiots believe it's poor, it's actually a mostly mainstream middle-class place. It's development came mostly out of African-Americans who flocked there for affordable rent. Most were from other parts of New York City, whether that be other parts of Manhattan or other boroughs, or places outside of the city, like New Jersey.    What can be misleading is the difference between the words ''black'' and ''African-American.'' New York City is technically 27 percent black, but there's a large amount of diversity. Most city's don't actually calculate the ''Black Hispanic'' number into the total ''black'' population, but in New York City, they did.    Of the 27 percent of New York City that's black, 8 of it (or close to 1/3 of NYC's blacks) are of Spanish speaking backgrounds (ex. Dominican, Puerto Rican). Than you have 7 percent of New York City that's West Indian. Some of that's Jamaican, some Hatian, Trinidadian and so forth. Most West Indian immigrants who came to America have skills. They're known for having education and a hard work ethic. Therefore, they turn out pretty successful here. Their children end up mostly mainstream middle class Americans. They're most significant in Queens, and parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx. As well as other places throughout the New York area.    To use Queens as an example though, in 2006, Queens was the only place in U.S. history where black's made more money than white's in a place. Prior to this, no place with more than 70,000 could say this. 2.3 million people live in Queens. Is this an African-American achievement though? No. It's much due to West Indians, who consume half the African descended population of Queens (Queens is 17 percent black).    A smear tactic the media often does is steals the credit of West Indians, who are their own ethnicity, and labels them African-Americans, simply because it's more strident. Well, Colin Powell was a Jamaican-American General, and only partly Afro-Jamaican-American, not African-American like the media says. Nor is the first ''African-American'' attorney general Eric Holder, who also had Caribbean roots. Nor fully is the first ''African-American governor'' of New York, David Paterson, who has partial Caribbean roots.    Part of ethnicity is kinship. African-Americans, like Afro-Jamaicans are their own ethnicity and this has to be recognized. So a ''black neighborhood'' in New York City may not necessarily quality as an African-American neighborhood. Also, when you dignify a neighborhood by an ethnicity, that ethnicity should consume of at least 50.1% of that neighborhood.

There are those that argue that it is not the natural way. You cannot take a woman and a woman or a man and a man and have both pairs procreate. A penis was made to go into a vagina.     There is also a group that argues about the religious side to it. Which I am guessing you already know their arguments.     Also when homosexuality starting popping up alot in the early 70's you heard alot of talk about HIV being spread by homosexuality, mainly due to the fact condoms were used primarily for a birth control method not a STD repellent. And actually to date, there are various STD that are usually spread by homosexuals. Ever give blood...they ask you have you come into contact with somebody or you yourself with somebody who is homosexual.|`|eDgVY0sAaa	Because people are stupid and allow others to think for them. We are still not beyond the point when people can look beyond the basic physical attributes of a person to see who they are so why would they be able to recognize what lies on the inside? They remain just as stupid, ignorant, and easily influenced as ever and not much will change that until they wish to learn and move beyond such simple things. Until people decide it is time for them to learn and grow then they will resist all efforts, no matter how logical, to recognize that which stares them right in the face.   My advice man, don't dwell on the petty problems of others. Seek to understand and better yourself and you'll do just fine. Be patient like me and wait for the world to change. But if you want to speed things up (like I am) then get right in there and become an activist man. Always fight and defend that which you know to be right and true with good evidence and logic and you'll be fine. You can change others minds but it usually must begin with one person at a time. You can do this by teaching people to recognize people not for what skin tone or physical attributes they share or sexual orientation but instead to recognize the person for who they are as an individual. Do this by leading by example, be you and follow your heart and you'll be fine. Don't worry about other people it will take them some time to understand that lesson and the sad thing is most people die never having realized that very lesson much less lived it. It took me until 7th grade to learn that lesson myself just another thing that being gay has helped me to realize.   I hope I've been of some help on the issue good luck and take care man. If you become an activist like I, then I truly hope that one day our paths may cross and we will get a chance to speed up the change that is long since overdue in this world.|`|b0a469ca1de10c02a0f10cfadae05d21aa	The simple and direct answer is that it is unnatural.

Big difference.  Yes He is present in every atom of every molecule, but each iota of matter is not God.  We are created in the image of God, and after His likeness; but we are not a part of God, nor are we gods ourselves.  If that were true, then there would be no discord among anyone for anything, and everyone would live in perfect harmony with one another.  However, since people tend to be stupid, and God is all-knowing, I would surmise to say we are our own entities, created by a loving God, and are born into this world, while another dimension, one of spirit not flesh, goes about it's business around us; probably filling in all of those little holes between each atom and molecule.  Most likely influenced by sound and frequency.  God did speak everything into existence.|`|3KXBzSzfaa	I love the Hindu religion and I agree with certain things much like Christianity.

LJ6vHfgoaa	No, he was not a Nazi.    >>can you put some proof with it?    Requirements for membership in the Nazi party:    "Any member of the German people who has a clean record, who is of pure German blood, who does not belong to a Freemason's lodge or any related organization, and who has completed his 21st year (in some cases his 18th) can become a member of the NSDAP [National Socialist German Workers' Party]"    Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) didn't turn 18 until April 16, 1945, only 2 weeks before Hitler killed himself, effectively ending the Nazi party.    "Male applicants under 25 years of age must show proof that they have completed their military service"    In the two week window between his 18th birthday and the ending of the Nazi party, did he complete his military service? No. He deserted and was taken prisoner by the Americans.     "Clergymen and other persons who have strong denominational connections cannot be admitted"     Joseph Ratzinger was a Catholic seminarian.|`|MbCFe1odaa	He was in Hitler's Youth if I remember correctly....|`|31fDBuLjaa	Yes, but he was a reluctant Nazi:    "Following his fourteenth birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the Hitler Youth, as membership was required for all 14-year old German boys after December 1939[7], but was an unenthusiastic member and refused to attend meetings..."|`|EPYHSuu2aa	Yes|`|qnL2JYihaa	It's unlikely, seeing that he was only twelve when the second world war was declared.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	he was in the hitler youth (not the nazi party). then again, so was just about every german of that age, it was like boy scouts or whatever. basically people who say this are accusing him of being an 80 year old german male.

The fact that the brain has such a robust response to unfairness shows that sensing unfairness is a basic evolved capacity.     The emotional response to unfairness pushes people from extreme inequity and drives them to be fair. This observation shows our basic impulse to be fair isn't a complicated thing that we learn.    It therefore fully illustrates that all humans have morals controlled by the brain and that Christians are entirely wrong to try and claim morals as their own!!!!|`|snj9zznvaa	Men never commit evil so fully and joyfully as when they do it for religious convictions    With or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.

If one believes there is a God, then they believe there is Satan. Satan being the father of all lies desires all mankind to be miserable like unto himself, so having no morals and low standards is his goal. God desires high morals and high standards, which is completely the opposite of what the world teaches and displays. You could have good morals and high standards and no believe in a God, just to keep yourself healthy and avoid the consequences of bad choices. I highly doubt many that do not believe in God have high morals and standards, because why. If all you think is going to happen when you die is nothing, well then eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die.

The same if you look at the pagan civilisations which existed before Christianity, and other religions like Hinduism with its 10000 gods.    Morality is simply the rules that govern human behaviour to create a safe and harmonious society. People who steal, murder, and rape cause distress in any human society, so they are immoral acts. Its a simple matter of everyone playing by the rules -- you don't do to others what you don't want done to you, and which does not cause division in the tribe (humans all used to live in small villages or tribes) as a whole. That social contract is the basis of morality.|`|JBkB1ZLJaa	We have all kind of people and reasons associated to this matter.  We can look at all the negatives aspects and fill the world with more garages that will consequently surround us and make our life dull.  Or we can focus our attention on the positive side of the matter and radiate more positivity in this world which will in return aspire us to live a better and happier life.  My personal opinion concerning the existence of God is based on an intelligent observation of the life and the universe in general.  It has nothing to do with fear, moral or any public influence.  To me the definition of God is the source of every religion conflicts.  The general individual seems to think that there is a Being somewhere watching over and ruling...  This is all misunderstanding of the truth.  The word (GOD) should be removed from every one's vocabulary for it confuses them and creates too many arguments.   (Existence) could replace the power that applies to all things and creatures in the universe.  For example: Everything exist that's why we can mention them. They are all animated by their existence. Our thoughts exist and again only because existence animate them.  It is the same with Love, Hate, Good and Bad. Emotions, actions and reactions; all of this come from the same source. It could be imagined as particles and vibrations. The vibration cannot (exist) without the particles. The particles only (exist) because they are vibrating around each other. -this is just elementary physic that any high school student can understand today.  The conclusion is there is only one source and only one power and only one presence. This source is the pure existence it is within all and is everywhere at all time. It needs no help no supplication or begging. It doesn't care if we live or die for everything goes back to recycle eternally.  People want a GOD that resemble to them who will feel sorry  for their sad experience and revenge to the one who do not act like they believe they should...  If we believe in love we at that moment are creating love within and without. At that exact time we are starting a reaction that is  coming from the existence itself. This is a good choice for it serves us positively and creates happiness in our life. Consequently it makes us generates more life instead of depression which stimulate our imagination for even more of the same thing. The bottom line is it doesn't matter if we are good or bad for it only affect the thinker and the believer involved in that specific event. Someone around us could be very frustrated and shot and blaspheme. The person who understands (God's) principle will just translate it his own way and move on not affected. On the other hand the negative actor will harvest his own seeding. Life is like a boomerang it comes back to the pitcher if it doesn't reach its target. Morality: it is wiser to choose good verse bad for this reason. Only the ignorant choose bad side for he doesn't know what he's doing.

bd01df5f99e6a62598250fd1e869d210aa	To Punk..  If someone believes murder is not a sin should we grant them that freedom and leave it between them and God?  God gives us the power to help each other overcome Sin.  Some things are wrong no matter what spin you try to put on them.  By making it socially acceptable we make it easier for people to give in the temptation.  Oh and so you know Abortion= Murder.|`|Azdg9KKwaa	As a Christian, I don't believe abortion is an acceptable means of birth control. I believe that God creates life and that we don't have the right to take the life of a child for convenience.     There are times when abortions are necessary to save the life of a mother - tubal pregnancies, the mother has to have cancer treatment and the child she's carrying is in the first trimester - the baby would be deformed or die from the treatment.  There are times when very difficult decisions have to be made that would end the life of the child.    It is not up to our government to fund this procedure regardless of the circumstances. Why is this being funded but other medical treatment is not being funded - like dental care, giving vacines that save lives in impoverished areas, etc.  Why is abortion so important to Obama?    Any person who condones ending the life of a child after the child is born and has survived abortion is no different than a common murderer. What difference does it make how old the person is?  The child is still a person - born alive.  But Obama said he has no problem with ending the life of that child if that's what the 'mother' wants to do. No, that is not a Christian as he professes to be.    They all lie to get into office - and then become puppets of those with money.  I fear America won't survive much longer with this kind of government intervention and control over the American people.  We have become slaves to the government who takes without paying back.|`|E9chZY74aa	No.  I knew exactly who he is and what he would do.

Some people don't believe abortion is a sin. Some do. Thankfully, we live in a secular government whose laws are not derived from religious texts. This isn't Saudi Arabia.    President Obama does not want the number of abortions to go up. By overturning the law, he's allowing for more comprehensive sexual education which will hopefully prevent pregnancies that would otherwise end in abortion or ill-equipped parenting.     By the way, I know Christians who personally oppose abortion but are pro-choice. If abortion truly is a sin, then the matter should be between G-d and the women in question.     In the meantime, mere humans should work on not judging others before they've walked a mile in their shoes.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	nope. i'm proud of obama for his support of a woman's right to choose.

The bill is two-sided...while those clinics do perform abortions, they also provide treatment to women who aren't visiting for an abortion.  The medical facilities are necessary.    Edit.  Irony in this question is that God admonishes his followers to stay neutral when it comes to politcs.  If you were truly concerned about doing God's will, then you wouldn't concern yourself with earthly governments.  :)|`|LpyEAcjeaa	Whether or not abortion clinics exist, or are even funded has nothing to do with the morality of abortion. Just because something is possible doesn't make it necessary.    If the Church hadn't failed to reach out to the people who get abortions instead of demonizing them, we wouldn't be having this discussion.     You can't tell people they can't do something because God doesn't want them too, especially if they don't believe in that God. You don't create a better society by outlawing everything you don't like, you create a better society by not being a douchebag.
qRFTEBlGaa	Although hard work prompted by love of money, loyalty to a corporation, or a competitive spirit ultimately frustrates and disappoints, the Bible does not brush aside the value of hard work. Every man should eat and indeed drink and see good for all his hard work. It is the gift of God. (Ecclesiastes 3:13) The Bible recommends enjoying the fruit of ones hard work. This gives us a hint as to what may be the proper view of hard work.    Eccl 3:22 says  And I have seen that there is nothing better than that the man should rejoice in his works, for that is his portion; because who will bring him in to look on what is going to be after him?    I explored with my heart by cheering my flesh even with wine, while I was leading my heart with wisdom, even to lay hold on folly until I could see what good there was to the sons of mankind in what they did under the heavens for the number of the days of their life. I engaged in greater works. I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself. I made gardens and parks for myself, and I planted in them fruit trees of all sorts. I made pools of water for myself, to irrigate with them the forest, springing up with trees. I acquired menservants and maidservants, and I came to have sons of the household. Also, livestock, cattle and flocks in great quantity I came to have, more so than all those who happened to be before me in Jerusalem. I accumulated also silver and gold for myself, and property peculiar to kings and the jurisdictional districts. I made male singers and female singers for myself and the exquisite delights of the sons of mankind, a lady, even ladies. And I became greater and increased more than anyone that happened to be before me in Jerusalem. Moreover, my own wisdom remained mine. And anything that my eyes asked for I did not keep away from them. I did not hold back my heart from any sort of rejoicing, for my heart was joyful because of all my hard work, and this came to be my portion from all my hard work.Eccl. 2:3-10.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	I kind of like Romans 8:31 What shall we then say to these things?

Galatians 2:20  I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

She is a relative of one, but she is not Queen. The Russian Queen was the Tsarina. Her daughters, like the famed Anastasia, were Grand Duchesses.|`|6aL6tDJlaa	Depends where you live I would say. The title of Queen can only apply if you are the Queen Regnant or the Queen Consort of a Kingdom.    Grand Duchess can apply to the daughters of Russian and Austrian Royalty (so Princesses basically)  but also applies to the Head of State or wife of the Head of State of a Grand Duchy (ie Luxembourg.)    So depending on whether you are in a Kingdom or a Grand Duchy you could still be the wife of the Head of State or the Head of State herself.    Kingdoms are generally bigger than Grand Duchies so if you would prefer more subjects then I guess you'd want to be a queen.|`|AA12005609	I'd rather be a queen.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8.

Are all these religions with some similarity proof of a common god....or proof of a common people|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	This is a very smart question. And as you suggest, men tamper with religions to mess them up... so that they all look so different.    My own opinion is that religions start out with a similar kind of truth... or I should say method for increasing the inner light. This will explain what I am talking about http://gospelenigma.com That story uses Christianity as an example... but the same thing happens to every religion.    Great question. You are right on target.|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	All of it is. And none of it. People don't have to run their lives by a "holy" book to be good people.

God wants you to come back to Him, you know that, don't you?|`|AA11832138	Although we think of it as a single book, the Bible is actually a collection of more than sixty books written by some forty writers over the course of well over a thousand years. Some of the oldest prophetic passages were already considered 'ancient' writings by those who lived generations afterward, and who likewise heard from God and penned the more recent books of the Bible. They, along with secular historians outside Israel, recorded the events that took place as foretold by the earlier writers.    Is there a chance that later writers 'fudged' these prophecies by writing them, or re-writing them, after the events occurred? No, because the ancient hand-written scrolls were copied and distributed far and wide. No one could possibly have collected all the copies, from Egypt to Babylon, to make such later modifications. And enough copies have been found, nestled among ancient artifacts unearthed during archaelogical digs, to establish that they were written long before the events they accurately predicted. No book compares to this.|`|GluPafOmaa	Peace be with you    I hope this message comes to you in a time of peace. You're question is very observant and thoughtful. There are a lot of things to study and question in religion, but what you said about people follow their religions because of family influences etc, may be wrong. Myself I reset my mind, meaning that I wasn't anything I didn't believe in God, I looked at the evidence of God, and found that yes, the evidence points to a God, but which is the right religion? So i researched, researched, researched and found the only religion that was true and you couldn't poke holes at or find any contradictions was Islam. If you wish to have a longer conversation~ because religion is quite a broad thing, so I would like to speak to you on msn or even e-mail, because I'm quite confident that I could prove Islam and God's existence, and maybe help you and give you advice.

So what I did when I was studying the Bible, I made sure that the religion was in accordance to what God wanted, and not what was popular among man. As some religions teach what they think the people want to hear, not what God wants.  Your relationship with God will be the most important of all, so in order to have that close relationship, one has to gain an accurate knowledge of God, NOT one based on false teachings. Its also not about what WE want, but what GOD wants.All the best to you.|`|mG6Pu12Paa	Love Life,      I'm 42 years old and still looking for the  "Right Church" to attend.  I believe Churches, for the most part, are teaching what is believed to be the truth.  We don't really know for sure which, if any, Bible is the true truth.  All we can do is hope for the truth to be shown us.  Who knows maybe all of the Bibles are true at the same time.  Find the place of worship that feels right to you and go with it.    I used the word Bible to represent the Holy Books of any recognized religion.|`|AA10401179	Personally i have battled with this question.  For me, I'm Chinese, two religions stick out that sounds truest to me. Buddhism and Christianity.  My personal journey has been no religion, became a Christian, backslided, lost, Christian, agnostic, Christian up to now.  In between, the agnostic period was when I was questioning the nature between these two religions. I was thinking both are equally valid, yet only one could be true at any one time.    Here's a lowdown.  Christianity is a belief in God.  Buddhism does not have a belief in God. But rather gods. The founder himself asserted his atheism and only created a philosophy founded on laws.    Therefore the basic question for me was: was there a God or not? If there was Buddhism would false. But if it was the other way round, Christianity would be true. I was truly seeking truth at that time, so both options were open to me. I was a Christian then already. In fact I had experienced a miracle. So what happened? I guess it was doubt. In the end, you should know what happened. After this the next challenge was pitting Christianity against Islam. Phew, this was easier.
bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, its one of the Ten Commandments. Break any of those and its a direct ticket to hell.    Blasphemy is um, like saying God does not exist, or Jesus is just a man and not the Son of God, or that the Bible is a load of hogwash.    Its pretty easy to do if you're not careful. But apparently you can just pray for forgiveness if you slip up and you get a clean slate.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	ALL sins can be forgiven.|`|AzwqJ6Hdaa	Blasphemy is when you go against God claiming that he's dead and he's not real.Also,saying his name as a curse word.Yes, it is a serious sin. Go to hell? I don't know. But,don't  listen to the other ones. They don't know what their talking about.Yes, God is loving and caring. And no,he doesn't send people to hell.They send their own selves  to hell.People today want to sin and be unholy and at the same time be rewarded for it.That's why they're angry.You can't have your cake and ice cream and eat it too!|`|62Tn86MCaa	I think the most accurate defintion that you speak of is "the crime of assuming to oneself the rights or qualities of God." It is not a one time sin, but rather is on going. The scripture from which you are referring (Matthew 12:31) clearly says it is not 'every' sort of blasphemy that will not be forgiven, but rather only blashphemy against God's spirit (which is his active force or his will) So back to the defintion, the people who have the most to be worried about this type of sin are religious leaders or others who claim to represent God but turn people away through their traditions and hypocrisy, and also girlfriends who make bad sammiches or no sammiches at all...lol. Also, hell is not a place of torment. The Hebrew word for "hell" is actually best translated as "pit" or "grave".|`|SPef3Mpcaa	The holy spirit is one of the biggest nonsenses in the entire Wholly Babble, and the alleged "Gifts of the holy spirit" are seen in just about every religion in the world where irrational emotion and stupidity are encouraged.    Of course, when the touch of this idiot spirit is felt in other religions the fundies start screaming about demon possession.    With any luck that'll count toward my blasphemy scores and keep that feeble little ghostie away. If that doesn't work I'll just have to keep trying.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=...  Jamaican :  God, but that sort of whiny thinking annoys me.  If God had ever existed, it died long ago, and if it were still alive it would be an evil demon of blood, torture rape and death.  If the christian god existed it would be duty of all decent men and women to work toward bringing it to trial and execution for its heinous crimes as avowed to in its own confessions known as the Old Testament.|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	Blasphemy in Theology means the act of claiming for one self the attributes and rights of God. In Judaism, a] Any word or deed meant to dishonor or revile the being or the work of God, as a curse or profanity. b] The mention of the sacred, ineffable name of God. Yes it is an unforgivable sin. The penalty in the old testament was death  by stoning. So whoever commits it will go to hell.|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	Blasphemy means to say disrespectful things about god.  That's all.    What you might be talking about is "blaspheming the holy spirit".  There is a verse in the bible that says this is the "unforgivable sin."  Trouble is, nobody can agree on what it is!

I think you may need to find an international lawyer. I would also see if the statute of limitations on kidnapping in your state have run out and, if not file charges against your ex-wife. Then you might can force extradition to the US, have her arrested and get your kids. I would also charge her new husband as well. That will keep him out of here hopefully.

You ask if this is God's will and say you are speaking to many people to get access to your children, so I wonder if you are a believer?

Pray to Him for direction. Continue to seek for help. You might want to go to the link I provided and look up these folks. Most of the services they have are free of cost and try to help people through difficult family situations and you seem to be in a complicated one. At least give them a call and see if they can help or point you in the right direction.

And resorting to shouting didn't help  your case.  The Courts in the UK do not prevent access for no reason.  Did you even bother to attend the Court case?  It seems not.  Your children are the only important things is in this issue and if they don't want to see you then that's all that matters.  Why did their Grandfather never see them when they were in the states?  You are the one who needs to wake up and stop being so aggressive and angry - it will achieve nothing.  If your wife has truly manipulated your children then as they grow up they will see that and no doubt come to find you.

Have the baby's room pictured, the house, the car, the family pet, the whole nine yards. And, I would start getting ready for some sleepless nights so, I would suggest a special rocking chair for your wife to sleep on in case the child sleeps in her arms instead of the crib.

f81f11f5ee6c2523c27fc82197dd6b2daa	I'm sorry that it didn't go well with your sister, but that doesn't mean that your mom will take it the same way. She may be very accepting- but it may still come as a shock to her. You know your mom best-- so that should help you decide if you should just tell her the news without the whole long intro, or break it to her slowly with hints and such before coming out. I remember when my brother told me he is actually MTF I was so relieved, because she built up this whole introduction, and I thought she had some horrible illness or had done something terrible. MTF?! No biggie. I couldn't be happier for her. She is so much more 'herself' these days than ever. Here's an idea: Bring a photo album with you with pics from when you were a kid, or if your mom has an album then great! Go through the album and point out different things about your appearance. Like, wow my hair was way too long.. I really didn't like wearing dresses, etc...slowly slowly may do the trick.     Hmm..In that case, I would wait until you've started therapy and have developed a strong support system- from existing friendships, or building friends through online GLBT support groups. If you sign up on groups.yahoo.com I noticed there are several groups specifically for FTM and many other support groups online like:  http://www.ftmi.org  http://www.tgcrossroads.org    Check this out for advice on coming out:  http://www.thetransitionalmale.com/TellP...  http://www.tsroadmap.com/early/comeout.h...      Best of luck! xoxo|`|fdkegbwgaa	Hi mate  Not really an easy way of doing it, however, make sure that you have some information for them so that it is easier on you when explaining how you feel.  make sure you are firm in what you say and that you sound sure that this is how you feel, the calmer you are with it the better they will be.  Give them time to absorb the impact as it will take some time for them to understand and they may feel the need to mourn the passing of their daughter.  If going to them is hard ask them to come to you as it is something better done face to face.  My parents live 6 hours away so I know how you feel!  I have put a website in, this is a great one for learning more about trans issues and may help.  Do you have a LGBT helpline or group near you.  Get their help if you do as without mine I would never have managed.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	You got 3 good answers already. Thanks for not insulting him. Age is a big factor... how old are you? Still in school? Or old enough to work?Please contact your local gay center or PFLAG.ORG for info on trans issues. Ask for pamphlets. Have you started transitioning yet? How far? All these things will have an affect on their reaction. Along with the pamphlets there are several great trans movies out that might help them to understand. One of the big things about coming out -either gay bi or trans - is to give the folks /family some time to digest the news. It all took us a long time to acknowledge our own differneces, so it's important to give them some time too. It won't be easy. Maybe you'll be able to find another trans person in the area who can assist you in your coming out. My very best to you. Have a great life.|`|nZBVbVbkaa	There isnt really any easy way of doing it, except for sitting your mum down and telling her   Sorry man  Maybe if you got your sister to help you?
AA11906603	Your question is both profound and simple. You don't need a higher education to figure out the answer. To become civilized, we need to try our best to be cruelty free. No excuses are allowed in the name of religion, historical wrongs that need to be set right, national or ethnic preferences, racial or sexual dominance or orientation. Those who trap and control other people with deception and fear-mongering can never be leaders to bring people into a civilized epoch.  Cruelty free means respecting others who do not agree with you, who may be dependent on you and who are different from you. It means respecting yourself and others, respecting people, and all life on this planet. Only when we all become a lot more cruelty free can we begin to claim we are civilized. If you go back far enough in history, we all come from barbarian roots, though there have been pockets of civilized people here and there for many years. We should all take the best from each culture, religion and "civilization" and use it to illuminate our paths going forward.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	Read  the book What civilisation is not.|`|kwYbe4n6aa	Go to college|`|4kfljeIGaa	It seems to me like you're trying to distinguish between "civilized" and "ethical."      Of course, you probably don't want to hear from me because I believe that civility at the core is treating others as you would like to be treated.  Much as that is a pillar of Judeo-Christian philosophy, I think the Spanish Inquisition 'majorly sucked.' So maybe that would make me "defining religion in my own way," then?    Or you could just do like the previous post said and go to college.  Simply let some professor fill your head with his or her own ideas about the subject.  College is supposed to inspire you to think, but in my experience, that's really not necessary.  You can usually get the best grades just by telling each teacher whatever he or she wants to hear.  (Having taught classes myself, you'd think my annoyance at that practice would make me immune to schmoozers, but it hasn't.  I'm just as guilty as the next Ultra-Liberal TA...)      But if you do decide to go on a soul seach, my best wishes to you!|`|ivGzzGOdaa	look upon your own heart,for what you have said defines a civilized person.|`|jTFHNLS7aa	I am so happy that you asked this question. 'Civilization' roughly is a well structured way of life followed by a large number of people. 'Culture' is the practices and behaviour of the group.    Indians claim of having a great culture, a set of practices and behavioural pattern. Let us examine some of these.    1. 99% of us do not follow traffic rules.   2. 99.9% of us do not have any respect for other human beings and our fellow citizens in particular.  3. If by bribing, we have a short-cut, we do it immediately.  4. Nothing happens in favour of the common man.  5. In our political system (the largest and most stable democracy) people vote for unworthy candidates knowingly.  6. People are not unified, but divided on the basis of religion and caste.  7. People could be murdered, looted and raped just because they belong to a particular religion.  8. You don't know when, where and how terrorists will strike.    Inspite of all these the country is growing on all fronts, perplexing the world. That's really great!|`|95c460c9bbd2609530690f8e73215021aa	A civilized person is one who observes cordiality, ethics, good customs, good morals, etiquette .  And the terminology is better place in a niche, meaning civilization is there for everybody to live up to in accordance with your allegations.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	Let's challenge this notion of "well educated."     The word education comes from "educo" which means to draw out.      The process has a touch of "Sleeping Beauty" to it.  Ideas and truthful insights sit inside of you and asleep for a long time until you read or hear something to "awaken" them inside of you to create moments of  "education."    Pick up a copy of A History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell.  Amazon has them used for maybe two bucks plus shipping. It contains short pieces about all sorts of important figures from the ancient  Greeks to Americans in the 20th Century.    No, you won't find ANSWERS to all your pressing questions, but you will meet a lot of "kindred spirits" along the way.    And don't forget -- Where you start is less important than where you finish!    Good luck and best wishes.|`|G6yyceAxaa	good question, I believe that civilization is defined by culture.  case and point being the so called "civilization" of native Americans.  in it's most basic point civilization is the ability of a society to live together without anarchy. and the most basic requirement of a civilization is laws.

However, it's a pretty useless exercise to try and "rank" the top 3 sororities,  Everyone is going to have their own opinions and everyone will have their own ideas as to what criteria are most important.

aO4iCwtoaa	Jews do not follow the ten commandments in the same way as Christians do.  In fact, in Judaism they're not called the ten commandments at all - they're called "Aseret haDibrot" - the ten statements or sayings.  In the actual Torah itself they are called "Aseret HaDevarim" - the ten words, or statements, and are understood to be ten categories of commandments, not simply ten commandments alone.  According to Jewish tradition, there are 613 commandments listed in the Torah, and while these ten categories are considered central in importance, they are not more important to follow than any of the others.      Also, Jews and Christians number them differently.  If you look at the list in the Bible, you will see that there are actually more than ten listed within the Ten.  So we have to decide what they are.  For Jews, the first commandment is "I am the Lord your God who brought you out of slavery in Egypt," and the second is "You shall have no other gods besides Me. Do not make a graven image or any likeness of what is in the heavens above"  Christians number them starting with 'No other gods' as the first, and 'No graven images' as the second.  This serves an important purpose - it separates the idea of praying to an image from the idea of the nature of G-d (which is crucial if you're a Catholic and pray to statues of Jesus and the saints - their interpretation is that the 'no graven images' commandment has to do with idol worship of OTHER gods, and therefore their practice doesn't contradict this).  For Jews, not worshiping images of G-d is an important part of not having other gods - we see G-d as an incorporeal entity that can not be reduced to an image, so praying to an image of our own G-d would be impossible - whatever we pray to in image form would by definition be a false god.     The other major difference is the fourth commandment.  While Christians accept the concept of the Sabbath as being important, the teachings of the NT essentially put Sabbath-keeping on the list of things abolished.  Even the day of the week was changed - Shabbat (Sabbath) is the word for Saturday in Hebrew, so the Sunday Sabbath is itself directly against the commandment to remember the Sabbath day.  Jews follow this commandment much more rigorously.|`|AA10471892	Your question is confusing, seeing as the ten commandments are the core of the old covenant, and Christians are not a party to the old covenant.    .|`|cYuGYhGmaa	to Bernie Madoff: THOU SHALT NOT STEAL!|`|3DjUX8etaa	The Ten Commandments are only the basics.

They believe in the Old Testament, not the New Testament. The main difference between Christians and Jews are that Jews do not believe that Jesus was the Messiah/Savior. They are still waiting. Jesus was actually Jewish. Christians believe Jesus accomplished his great works of salvation already (New Testament) and are waiting for him to return. Muslims as well believe in the Old Testament and do not believe in Jesus as the savior, instead he's a prophet. Hope this helps.|`|6bKws0fAaa	this is a very confusing matter and not at all simple but try to follow me here  God brought the ten commandments to Earth so that men would know what is righteouss and what is requested of God  yet sin seizing the opportunity, planted itself in the hearts of men when they read the ten commandments  for no one would know what sin was if they hadn't read the ten commandments  so the ten commandments brought sin in a way, but the law was not wicked, the law was righteous, it was just the sin brought by it that was wicked  so the law brought death to all men including Jews  yet when Christ the Lord came, he died in order to fulfill the justice  for we all disobeyed the law and Jesus came and died for it   he paid the price for the punishment that we deserved  so the law brought death and Jesus brought life for he fulfilled the ten commandments and justice was served through Him  well all in all what I'm saying is that Jews should wake up and see what is at hand  there is a savior! there is no more punishment for he who believes and gives his entire life to Jesus|`|AA11992885	the Rabbis were the only ones given the authority to interpret the texts, why would we Jews follow the 10 commandments as the christians interpret them????    we are legalistic, as God commanded, and thus, we analyze things to death    how about asking a JEWISH Rabbi, not a messianic rabbi, about how the commandments are to be understood|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	The original are narrower in scope, applying only to Hebrews (which is why they  could be forbidden to kill,  and still exterminate the Canaanites and take the Promised Land with divine sanction).  Christianity has been influenced by other western ideals, such as the sanctity of life in general, and the Commandments have been, largely, rewritten.

Every gay person who comes out to the media, makes it easier for the young people coming out now.   Just so you know, gay teens try to commit suicide 10 times more often than straight teens because they have no support system. They are scared of their feelings and of the possible raction by their family.

You cannot be a Christian and believe in Christ and then change and go to another religion and come back to Christ.  You cannot crucify Christ twice the Bible says.  In 1John, (I think) it says that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is unpardonable.  Basically that is condemning goodness or teaching that bad is really good and good is really bad.  Aside from these, the Bible says the worst sin is pride-but this is not unpardonable.  Personally, I don't think suicide is unpardonable.  Catholics believe it is because you cannot ask for forgiveness-but what about all the people who die accidentally or have a heart attack or car wreck?  Christians live under continual cleansing of Christ's blood.

The larger context of that statement is that the Pharisees had recently accused Jesus of casting out demons by the power of Satan.  The gospel accounts demonstrate that Jesus performed all His miracles by the power of the Holy Spirit--all miracle accounts come after the baptism and descent of the Holy Spirit at that event.  At face value then it would seem blasphemy of the Holy Spirit would be attributing His actions to the evil one.  I do not think this is meant soteriologically--its more like an inexcusable error, like the Pharisees should have known better.  Read the whole thing in context, it appears to be hyperbole to make a point like when Jesus said if your right eye causes you to sin then gouge it out.|`|GnZTf7ANaa	pride. the mother of all sin.|`|AA10976828	the unforgivable sin is blasphemy against the holy spirit. however unforvivable sin can extend to sin that the sinner is not willing to be repentant for. we must seek forgivness when aware of sin.     blasphemy is words or actions that dishonor god,words of irreverance against god.  there are two primary premises    1) heretical blasphemy which is a denial of gods providence and is more grave in that it is a sin against the faith.    2) imprecatory blasphemy which is an impreciation against god that evil may follow.     blasphemy comes from the hebrew word meaning "pierced" but from the greek in the new testament means "reviling". so in conclusion words or actions of reviling god,jesus or the holy spirit(the trinity) are blasphemy unrepented sins can be counted aswell.

The difficult aspect of determining the Biblical canon is that the Bible does not give us a list of the books that belong in the Bible. Determining the canon was a process, first by Jewish rabbis and scholars, and then later by early Christians. Ultimately, it was God who decided what books belonged in the Biblical canon. A book of Scripture belonged in the canon from the moment God inspired its writing. It was simply a matter of God convincing His human followers which books should be included in the Bible.    Compared to the New Testament, there was very little controversy over the canon of the Old Testament. Hebrew believers recognized Gods messengers, and accepted their writings as inspired of God. There was undeniably some debate in regards to the Old Testament canon. However, by 250 A.D. there was nearly universal agreement on the canon of Hebrew Scripture. The only issue that remained was the Apocryphawith some debate and discussion continuing today. The vast majority of Hebrew scholars considered the Apocrypha to be good historical and religious documents, but not on the same level as the Hebrew Scriptures.    For the New Testament, the process of the recognition and collection began in the first centuries of the Christian church. Very early on, some of the New Testament books were being recognized. Paul considered Lukes writings to be as authoritative as the Old Testament (1 Timothy 5:18; see also Deuteronomy 25:4 and Luke 10:7). Peter recognized Pauls writings as Scripture (2 Peter 3:15-16). Some of the books of the New Testament were being circulated among the churches (Colossians 4:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:27). Clement of Rome mentioned at least eight New Testament books (A.D. 95). Ignatius of Antioch acknowledged about seven books (A.D. 115). Polycarp, a disciple of John the Apostle, acknowledged 15 books (A.D. 108). Later, Irenaeus mentioned 21 books (A.D. 185). Hippolytus recognized 22 books (A.D. 170-235). The New Testament books receiving the most controversy were Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, and 3 John. The first canon was the Muratorian Canon, which was compiled in (A.D. 170). The Muratorian Canon included all of the New Testament books except Hebrews, James, and 3 John. In A.D. 363, the Council of Laodicea stated that only the Old Testament (along with the Apocrypha) and the 27 books of the New Testament were to be read in the churches. The Council of Hippo (A.D. 393) and the Council of Carthage (A.D. 397) also affirmed the same 27 books as authoritative.    The councils followed something similar to the following principles to determine whether a New Testament book was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit: 1) Was the author an apostle or have a close connection with an apostle? 2) Is the book being accepted by the Body of Christ at large? 3) Did the book contain consistency of doctrine and orthodox teaching? 4) Did the book bear evidence of high moral and spiritual values that would reflect a work of the Holy Spirit? Again, it is crucial to remember that the church did not determine the canon. No early church council decided on the canon. It was God, and God alone, who determined which books belonged in the Bible. It was simply a matter of God convincing His followers of what He had already decided upon. The human process of collecting the books of the Bible was flawed, but God, in His sovereignty, despite our ignorance and stubbornness, brought the early church to the recognition of the books He had inspired.

Many of them were Jews, others Gentiles. The Penteteuch (first 5 books) is the first part written, typically attributed to Moses. Paul wrote a big chunk of the New Testament.    My girlfriend's a nursing student, I wish you well in your pursuits. Hang in there.|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	For those who would say the Bible is not the Word of God, or that the Bible contains numerous errors I would say this: Paul could say in 2nd Timothy 3:16, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God." That's the Greek word, "theopneustos" meaning "God-Breathed." Every single word was given from God to 40 different men, and 2nd Peter 1:21 adds: "for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." Now that was the Old Testament. The New Testament wasn't in existence when Paul used these verses. He was telling the churches in his letters what had happened in the past, but in John 16:12-13, Jesus talked about the coming of the New Testament. He says, "I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of Truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come."     That's the New Testamant. And we can say with John 17:17, "Your Word is Truth." Today, we have 66 books written by 40 different individuals on 3 continents covering a period of 1,500 years and there's not one mistake, regardless of what some of the critics say. They haven't studied God's Word enough to know the truth. Among the writers we had kings, poets, philosophers, prophets, scholars and fisherman. And I want you to know we have all of the Word of God today. Someone says, "Yes, but we don't have the original manuscripts" Who said so?    We have copies totalling 24,800. Now, how do we know that they're right? Well, if you take 20 items and you compare them and 19 state one thing and one doesn't, then the one is in error. We've got 24,800 manuscripts that exist today to compare one against another and we have another 80,000 quotations from the church fathers, enough to put the entire Bible together with the exception of 11 verses. Take the 80,000 quotations from the church fathers and the 24,800 manuscripts for a total of 104,800 and you have all of God's Word dozens and hundreds of times. This is so because God's Word is literally flawless. After computers have compared millions, or even billions, of letters in analyzing the 104,800 manuscripts the texts are basically flawless. So, don't listen to the critics. The Bible is the Word of God.|`|66ge4Rzlaa	Not a question that can be answered in a hurry. Make the time.
Yp8dlrmKaa	como esas hay muchas las formas de cmo la Bilbias demuestra que JESUS ES DIOS!!!!!!!!!!!!    HABER_  QUE DIJO, TOMAS AL VER A JESUS RESUCITADO: NO DIJO: JESUS MIO, Y DIOS MIO!!! Y LOS HOMBRES CUANDO FUERON A VER AL NI?O RECIEN NACIDO, NO DIJERON VENIMOS A ADORADLE!!!! Y QUIEN ESTABA EN EL PECEBRE ????????? NO ERA JESUS!!!!!!!!!!!! PUES A JESUS SE LE ADORA COMO DIOS VERDADERO!!!!!!!!!! pero ellos lo que hacen es Venerar a Jess, no le Adoran!!! acaso los hombres Sabios , eran idolatras???? no hay que olvidar de donde vienen los TESTIGOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ELLOS NO SON CRISTIANOS!!!! CRISTIANO ES TODO AQUEL QUE SIGUE A CRISTO Y LO RECONOCE COMO SU SALVADOR Y SU DIOS!   TRES PERSONAS DISTINTAS!!!!!!!!!! DIFERENTES!! UNA SOLA NATURALEZA DIVINA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    ellos no adoran ni reconoces la Naturaleza Divina de Jess!!! El tiene las DOS Naturaleza!! La Divina por ser Dios y manifestarse como tal y la de Hombre Verdadero, nos igualo en TODO MENOS en el pecado!!!!!!    La Biblia ense?a que Jesucristo es Dios Los Testigos de Jehov es la nica secta cristiana que, con la Biblia en la mano, cree y publica que Jescristo no es Dios.    Juan1:1-3:  Al principio era el Verbo, y el Verbo estaba en Dios, y el Verbo era Dios. Todas las cosas fueron hechas por l, y sin l no se hizo nada de cuanto ha sido hecho.     Aqu el Verbo es Jesucristo. Esto no lo niegan ni los Testigos de Jehov En la proclamacin "el Verbo era Dios", los Testigos de Jehov, en su Biblia, le han a?adido la palabra "un", quedando as: "El Verbo era un Dios", como para poder decir que no era el nico Dios. Pero resulta que en la Biblia slo hay un Dios, as es que aun con su misma traduccin resulta que Jess era y es Dios, el nico Dios, porque por l fueron hechas todas las cosas, y sin l no se hizo nada de cuanto ha sido hecho (Juan 1:3).    Colosenses 1:16:  En Cristo fueron creadas todas las cosas del cielo y de la tierra, las visibles y las invisibles, los tronos, las dominaciones, los principados, las potestades; todo fue creado por l y para l. l es antes de todo, y todo subsiste en l.     Aqu est bien claro que Jess es Dios. Pero los Testigos en su Biblia, en su obcecacin por decir que Jess no es Dios, a?aden cuatro veces la palabra "otras", entre parntesis, cuando no tiene sentido, porque si hizo "todas las cosas" ?cules son las "otras" cosas que no hizo? As dicen los Testigos en su Biblia: "Porque por medio de l todas (las otras) cosas fueron creadas en los cielos y sobre la tierra, las cosas visibles y las cosas invisibles, no importa que sean tronos o se?oros, o gobiernos, o autoridades. Todas (las otras) cosas han sido creadas mediante l y para l. Tambin l es antes de todas (las otras) cosas, y por medio de l se hizo que todas "las otras" cosas existiesen."    Como se ve leyendo su propia traduccin, se contradicen, porque si hizo "todas las cosas", las visibles, las invisibles, las del cielo, las de la tierra, etc ?Cules son las "otras"? No queda ninguna otra cosa por hacer. Adems los Testigos mismos confiesan que la palabra "otras" es a?adida, que no est en la Biblia. ?Y la Biblia hace una amenaza muy fuerte contra los que a?aden o quitan algo a la Biblia. As dice la misma Biblia de los Testigos: Si alguien hace una a?adidura a estas cosas, Dios le a?adir a l las plagas que estn escritas en este rollo; y si alguien quita algo de las palabras del rollo de esta profeca, Dios le quitar su porcin de los rboles de la vida y de la santa ciudad (Revelacin 22:18-19).    Este libro de la Revelacin o Apocalipsis dice en varios sitios que Jess es Dios, pero los testigos lo ignoran, le cambian el sentido, y suelen usar este libro y el libro de Daniel para confundir a sus seguidores, porque estos dos libros usan muchos smbolos, no son fciles de interpretar a veces, y son fciles para cambiarles el sentido.    Apocalipsis 1:18 dice que Jess el el primero y el ltimo y eso es ser Dios. Apocalipsis 22:13, hablando de Jess, el que viene pronto dice: Yo soy el alpha y el omega, el primero y el ltimo, el principio y el fin. ?Otra vez es Dios, igual que Jehov, Dios Padre, al que lo llama el "alfa y el omega" en Apocalipsis 1:8! Pero los Testigos cambian el sentido de la Biblia en su obcecacin de demostrar que Jess no es Dios. Y qu casualidad. Slo los Testigos y todos los Testigos dicen lo mismo, no porque lo dice la Biblia, sino porque lo dicen sus "Papitas", Russell and Rutherford... Si los Testigos siguieran la Biblia, y no sus "Papitas", por lo menos algunos de los Testigos veran que la Biblia dice que Jess es Dios, como lo ven y creen ms de mil millones de cristianos... Pero no: ?Todos los Testigos creen que Jess no es Dios! No porque lo lean en la Biblia, sino porque creen a sus "Papitas", no a la Biblia.|`|EpfxNhUcaa	No amigo yo no soy testigo pero te puedo asegurar que Jess no es Jehov ya que el mismo lo dijo un sin numero de oportunidades , la idea de un dios trino la impuso la iglesia catlica y esta errada     Jess es hijo de Dios, en toda la Biblia no hay nada que afirme lo contrario, ni tampoco nada que afirme la trinidad de dios , los que sostienen esa teora son los catlicos y fue en a?o 320 de la era cristiana en el concilio de nicea que esta idea fue puesta en practica , pero en realidad es solo una contaminacin con las ideas de platn y Scrates que crearon la teologa o estudio de los dioses.    La idea de la Trinidad de dios, en donde se incluye a cristo sale del pasaje de san Juan     1:1 En el principio era el Verbo, y el Verbo era con Dios, y el Verbo era Dios.   1:2 Este era en el principio con Dios.   1:3 Todas las cosas por l fueron hechas, y sin l nada de lo que ha sido hecho, fue hecho.       Pero lo que Juan quiere decir en este pasaje es que Jess cumpli con todo lo de la palabra     En fin asunto largo y complicado pero es la verdad      Jess es hijo de dios no dios como lo demuestra la Biblia     Marcos   13:32 Pero de aquel da y de la hora nadie sabe, ni aun los ngeles que estn en el cielo, ni el Hijo, sino el Padre    Jess dijo que estaba dispuesto a obedecer la voluntad del padre     Juan 5:19 5:19 Respondi entonces Jess, y les dijo: De cierto, de cierto os digo: No puede el Hijo hacer nada por s mismo, sino lo que ve hacer al Padre; porque todo lo que el Padre hace, tambin lo hace el Hijo igualmente.   5:20 Porque el Padre ama al Hijo, y le muestra todas las cosas que l hace; y mayores obras que estas le mostrar, de modo que vosotros os maravillis.     Juan   5:30 No puedo yo hacer nada por m mismo; segn oigo, as juzgo; y mi juicio es justo, porque no busco mi voluntad, sino la voluntad del que me envi, la del Padre    Juan   8:28 Les dijo, pues, Jess: Cuando hayis levantado al Hijo del Hombre, entonces conoceris que yo soy, y que nada hago por m mismo, sino que segn me ense? el Padre, as hablo.   8:29 Porque el que me envi, conmigo est; no me ha dejado solo el Padre, porque yo hago siempre lo que le agrada    Juan   12:49 Porque yo no he hablado por mi propia cuenta; el Padre que me envi, l me dio mandamiento de lo que he de decir, y de lo que he de hablar.   12:50 Y s que su mandamiento es vida eterna. As pues, lo que yo hablo, lo hablo como el Padre me lo ha dicho.     Juan   14:28 Habis odo que yo os he dicho: Voy, y vengo a vosotros. Si me amarais, os habrais regocijado, porque he dicho que voy al Padre; porque el Padre mayor es que yo.   14:29 Y ahora os lo he dicho antes que suceda, para que cuando suceda, creis.     Juan   20:17 Jess le dijo: No me toques, porque an no he subido a mi Padre; mas ve a mis hermanos, y diles: Subo a mi Padre y a vuestro Padre, a mi Dios y a vuestro Dios.    etc. nunca dice que el es dios todo lo contrario el dice ser el hijo de dios que hace la voluntad de su padre|`|bc7e58456b6128aebb7baa2b3fa4c9b6aa	Porque a la biblia cada cul la lee y la entiende a su manera, muchos piensan hasta que lo que dice es verdad, jjejejeje,  uy uy uy, una vaca volando!!!!!!!!!, corre mira desde tu ventana.|`|cW8nWmQjaa	Eso slo son cuestiones semnticas,que ms da,me da repelus la gente estrecha de miras.La biblia no prueba nada,relata cosas.|`|HKGRFqRmaa	JESUS es 100% hombre y 100% Dios eso solo lo puede ser el hijo del padre!|`|JNaZ0jK8aa	mi amigo mi esposa es testigo aunque yo no te puedo decir que claramente no es jehova porque serian la misma persona la biblia dice claramente que es hijo de dios y jesus claramente se refiere a dios como su padre y de paso aunque no conparto algunas doctrinas de los testigo quisiera hacer una aclaratoria a sirenita no non una secta sino una congregacion y conosco muchos testigos y te puedo decir que en su mayoria son gente buena y humanitaria que estudian la biblia|`|95632ba66a21ca0ca3f6e60a2d76d81caa	No puedes asegurar lo que dices porque es una traduccion, debes remitirte al texto original.

"alguien esta clamando en el desierto:"            (aqui hay dos puntos suspensivos " : " por si no lo notaste, que indica que la siguiente sentencia la dice alguien mas y no la misma persona, estamos?, es decir, "alguien" clama... no "yo clamo")     y si, la profecia se cumplio en mateo 3:3,   y segun  tus propias palabras, las dijo juan el bautista y no jesus  como mas adelante intentas confundir. ("Amigos TDJ para quien preparo el camino juan el bautista?")       es decir, en Mat. 3:3 Juan el Bautista dice, "este es de hecho 'aquel' ..."   (identificando que quien era el que aclamaba era otro y no el)    "preparen el camino de jehovah" verdad que no se referia asi mismo como el clamador sino a otro...pero todo eso segun tu, y no la biblia... luego te aclaro esto.     solo investiga con que autorizacion, las traducciones biblicas agregan puntos y comas cuando los escritores biblicos no las conocian, verdad que si las colocamos a criterio personal cambia la cosa? pues eso han hecho todas las religiones para basar sus creencias, solo que alguna le tiene que dar al clavo..., es decir apegarse a lo que la biblia dice en general...      es decir, creian los personajes biblicos que jesus era jehovah?      Angel Gabriel : y sera llamado HIJO del ALTISIMO (no jehovah, nota, gabriel es un angel!)    Juan el Bautista :  yo lo he visto y he dado tetimonio de que este es el "hijo de Dios"   isaias : Un HIJO se nos ha dado (9:6)  jehovah : este es mi hijo, el amado, a quien he aprobado (mateo 3:17) necesitaria jehovah amarse y aprobarse a si mismo? por favor, es todo poderoso, no necesita consentimiento de nadie "hagase tu voluntad, no la mia" dijo jesus  jesucristo: : ?Me dicen ustedes a m, a quien el Padre santific y despach al mundo: Blasfemas, porque dije: Soy Hijo de Dios?. (Juan 10:36.) Jess no dijo que fuera Dios el Hijo, sino que era Hijo de Dios.  Pedro: "tu eres el cristo, el HIJO DEL DIOS VIVO" (mateo 16:16)  Soldados romanos: "ciertamente, este era HIJO DE DIOS" (Mat 27:54)  Demonios "que tenemos que ver contigo HIJO DE DIOS?"(Mateo 8:29).     y asi sucesivamente..., ni escritores evangelicos, ni angeles, ni jehovah, ni profetas, ni soldados romanos y ni jesuscristo   Hasta los demonios, quienes creen que hay un solo Dios, saban por su experiencia en las regiones celestiales que Jess no era Dios (SANTIAGO 2:19).     quieres mas? lee la biblia; y preguntate, que creian de jesus los personajes biblicos      juan 1:1? con respecto a este versiculo, a los primeros "cristianos" que empezaban a creer en la trinidad(S.III Y IV, ensenanza catolica aunque no lo quieras), ni si quiera usaban este versiculo para avalar su creencia de que jesus era Dios., pues sabian bien su significado "la palabra era un ser divino"  y este ser divino ESTABA con Dios no que el FUERA Dios.            pero en fin, el apostol Juan resume el asunto diciendo:  : Estas han sido escritas para que ustedes crean que Jess es el Cristo el Hijo de Dios, no que fuera el Dios Todopoderoso. Y en este texto se quiso decir Hijo en sentido literal, como cuando se habla de un padre natural y su hijo, no como si Jess fuera alguna parte misteriosa de una Deidad trinitaria.

Por ejemplo, hice la prueba en el Google con las palabras bautistas, pentecostales y luterano y al menos en la primera pgina de resultados de la bsqueda no vi ni un solo sitio dedicado a desprestigiarlos o escrito por un ex bautista, ex pentecostal o ex luterano (en este ltimo caso, slo haba una noticia desfavorable, de un medio que podramos llamar neutral)pero si buscas por testigo de Jehov la INMENSA MAYORIA de los enlaces son para atacarnos. ?Qu extra?o! Pero la Biblia predijo que los cristianos verdaderos serian perseguidos, y no al revs. Los hechos muestran que el 99% de las pginas web atacan con sa?a, irona, burla, sarcasmo y mentiras a los testigos de Jehov. Lo ms increble es que los testigos de Jehov son una minora religiosa en cualquier pas del mundo.  ?Tanto tiempo, dinero y recursos en contra de los TJ cuando nosotros s gastamos tiempo, dinero y recursos para promover valores familiares, el respeto a las autoridades civiles, la conciencia de cuidar nuestro planeta, nuestra salud, etc! mira la pagina web oficial de los TJ en espa?ol. http://www.watchtower.org/s/index.html..... Te invito a examinarla, o ?acaso las publicaciones de los testigos de Jehov promueven el odio?... ?o la persecucin y desprecio hacia otras creencias?... Si denunciamos a la religin falsa citamos de investigadores que no son TJ, libros, peridicos y revistas, neutrales que solo presentan los hechos e invitamos a las personas a que saquen sus propias conclusiones. Acaso una persona por leer o estudiar las publicaciones se hace TJ?... ?mentira! de los 6.500.000 de estudios que conducimos a nivel mundial, solo menos de 250.000 se hacen testigos anualmente. Queremos edificar no solo a la gente de nuestra propia religin sino a toda la comunidad donde vivimos, traerles buenas noticias de cosas mejores (que no son nuestras sino de Jehov), de la belleza de nuestro planeta tierra y de las personas y del prjimo.   ?Porqu somos perseguidos como minora religiosa? por las mismas razones que se han perseguido a los primeros cristianos la predicacin y la naturaleza de nuestra obra: a la gente le fastidia nuestra neutralidad en asuntos polticos y en las guerras, a algunos les molesta que nos esforcemos por llevar una vida honesta, nos dicen que deberamos ser ms vivos y menos bobos, aunque reconocemos que no somos perfectos y que cometemos errores. Mientras tanto la religin falsa bendice las armas, participa en poltica y LLEVA A LA MUERTE A MILLONES DE JVENES SANOS cada a?o y les dan la licencia moral para matar en nombre de los colores de la patria o en nombre de Dios, ense?a que todo lo malo es voluntad de Dios, que cuando muere un ni?o es porque Dios necesita un angelito ya que sus millones de ngeles no le bastan, que tenemos un alma o espritu inmortal que tiene sistema nervioso para poder sentir el calor y sufrimiento por los pecados veniales en el purgatorio por un tiempo o tormentos indescifrables en el infierno por toda la eternidad si ha sido malo, que todos los buenos vamos al cielo, que es el mismo paraso, para reinar con Cristo, gracias a la mediacin de Mara, la madre de Jehov-Jesucristo-Espritu Santo, desde un nuevo cielo sobre los animales que existan sobre una nueva tierra ya que Dios destruir este actual mundo con fuego, quizs en por ah en 500, 1000 o 10.000 a?os y que debemos orar al Espritu Santo que es la tercera persona de la Santsima Trinidad la cual posey en forma simultnea a 120 discpulos para que hablaran cosas para as poderle predicarle al viento como se hace en la actualidad y que de todas maneras es el mismo Dios al cual Jess se dijo as mismo en muchas ocasiones: Padre nuestro que ests en los cielos, estando en la tierra, el cual as mismo se autoexclam ?Padre porque me has abandonado? y que luego se autoresucit y subi a los cielos para sentarse a la derecha de s mismo. La religin nos ense?a de una resurreccin en un futuro pero muy pero muy lejano el cual nuestras almas inmortales se metern dentro de nuevos cuerpos que nos dar Dios para ser juzgados por nuestros pecados del pasado para ser destruidos nuevamente junto con nuestras almas inmortales o para reencarnar en animales inferiores o en otras vidas para evolucionar a esferas espirituales y unirnos finalmente al Nirvana.   Amigos, los invito a todos a dejar de jugar con fuego, si realmente son cristianos verdaderos no deberan faltarle el respeto a lo que segn su juicio es una secta cristiana, sino que deberan salir a predicar como dijo Jess a todos los descarriados, pero los Testigos de Jehov esperamos que realicen esa obra, sin embargo lo que obtenemos de la mayora son estos insultos. No les pagaremos con la misma moneda, Jess y sus discpulos verdaderos del primer siglo no lo hicieron y nosotros seguiremos su ejemplo al igual que lo hicieron hermanos nuestros al ser torturados en los campos de concentracin nazi por obedecer a Dios como gobernante ms bien que a los hombres (Hechos 5:29).  El mismo Gran Maestro muy bien profetiz que sus verdaderos discpulos seran objeto de odio de parte de todas las naciones (Mateo 24:9) pero tambin dijo cul sera el resultado final (Mateo 5:11, 12; Mateo 25: 31- 46).|`|q8wvo6Qmaa	Pues es cierto...

En cuanto a los textos que citas, esto se debe a que Jess represent a su Padre.

yJCdLNHwaa	The one unforgivable sin is to blasphem against the Holy Ghost.  This means to lay every blame at His door and to put Him down and say things that may be mean and hurtful.

You SHOULD NOT however interfere with another person's right to practice it or hold thier beliefs.    If a christian wants to question an ***-pirate and thier lifestyle that is not an attack, you are still respecting that they can make that choice, just like christianity, if a buddist were to question christianity they have every right to do so.     so long as they don't try to FORCE you to follow thier beliefs by lobbying for buddist legislation or push for laws that push thier religious beliefs that don't meet the seperate test of bringing safety and order to society for the purpose of a better functioning society.|`|yJCdLNHwaa	Yes, Christianity is a lifestyle.

It is therefore considered a religion since that is what Catholicism is, but in its mere content it is not meant to be a religion but a lifestyle as you said.   I was once told not to devote my life to a religion, because no religion was crucified 2000 years ago. Jesus was, so it is to Jesus taht we ought to be devoted. You don't need to accept Christianity, not even Jesus if you don't want to. If do do want Jesus, then that's what you need to accept. Leave terms such as religion and sacraments aside, it's all about Jesus and that's as far as it should go.|`|UiIKiFABaa	Christianity is a lifestyle...whether you accept it or not is your business!!

It is realizing you are a sinner and discovering that Christ came to save you from it by dying on the cross.   And when you receive Him into your heart He saves you and puts you right with God.   It is a new life but not a lifestyle.|`|9JfH5ZXpaa	You're fortunate to live in a country where you are free to do that.  As long as you don't infringe on anybody else's right to do their thing.

bdfa59d7b07a9f8d87b377a23b2a1873aa	I am sorry but you cannot be accepted in the Catholic faith unless you accept the following:    The Apostles' Creed is a brief statement of the fundamental Christian beliefs. It is a profession of faith, like the Nicene Creed used at Mass. Tradition tells us that the Apostles' Creed was handed down from the Apostles themselves. It is likely that it was first written down, however, sometime after the Apostolic age.  The Apostles' Creed  I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.  And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He arose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

60082a7ceaa437efab05d26962c15ed9aa	Mira, para que sepas, yo si lo se que significan y de donde vienen, ya lo he dicho varias veces en muchas preguntas.    Mira, su origen  fue creado para evitar reclamos, y hacer el sincretismo (muy comn en toda religin) puesto, para poder evangelizar, se necesitaban buscar formas para poder identificar o combinar el uso de un santo con el de un Dios de los paganos, pero siempre, siempre se a especificado que no son imagenes que tengan poder alguno o que hagan milagros, son, simplemente muestra y representacin iconica de aquella persona que tomo a ejemplo de vida la de Jesus, sea vista y conocida.    No es idolatria (en mi caso) yo adems, se que son como muestra de quienes fueron estas personas que siguieron el ejemplo de Cristo, que supieron seguir sus ense?anzas y lo amaron hasta su muerte, y recuerda, que fueron usados como "instrumentos evangelizadores" en el mundo, que las personas no sepan esto... pues es su problema.    Igualmente, no les pido ningun milagro a esa imagen ni al santo, pues yo se que ellos no hacen milagros, interceden ante Jess, para que el mismo Jess interceda ante su Padre, y de Dios depende si se hace o no su voluntad.  Yo creo que el santo no es ms que una persona que tuvo como mision seguir el ejemplo de Cristo, y ahora, es un nexo que se da ante Jess, pues como dicen por ahi, mucha idolatria y mucha INEXACTITUD HACIA DIOS, a ido alejando a la humanidad de Jess, unico y verdadero nexo en esta vida hacia Dios, ?pero, si no me acerco a el? ?qu puedo hacer?.    Busca el consejo de aquellos que siguieron su ejemplo, de quienes fueron unicos en la vida. Ahora, todos, desde el momento del nacimiento, tenemos el don de la Santidad, motivo por el cual, uno puede o no ejercer tal don. ?pero no quiero ser venerado? No te preocupes, no ejerzas este don en publico, o de plano no lo uses. ?Pero si quiero ser venerado? A pues, ejercelo al maximo, sigue el ejemplo de vida de Jess, conviertete y deja que la vida lo decida y el mismo Dios es quien pide o no si puedes ser venerado publicamente, pero en su mente y corazn, ya eres un santo.    pero al venerarlos (distinto a adorarlos) ?peco?    No, pues si tu estas enterado y sabes que no son Dios, que son como una estatua erigida en honor (como las que hay en camellones y lugares publicos, o como muchos las llegan a ver como arte sacro) y que son el nexo ante Jess, No cometes pecado. Se peca en el momento en que tomas a esta imagen como semejante o igual a Dios, y no le pides su intersecin, sino que por el contrario, le pides cosas vanas y fuera de lugar, o tambien se peca cuando dejas de seguir un ejemplo de vida, y te alejas de Dios y de todo aquello que lo une.    Asi mismo con las imagenes Maranas, son simplemente iconos o imagenes que muestran las bondades de aquella que tuvo el honor de ser Madre de Dios, ?cuntas imagenes ha habido, que no son veneradas, sino admiradas por su bella representacin, como arte etc?) Asi mismo, ella tuvo el privilegio y la ordenanza de ser otro instrumento para unir a la humanidad con Dios, ?quien sino aquella que concibio al Hijo de Dios? Y lo hace hablando, haciendose ver que estamos mal, pero como no puede permanecer en la tierra, la imagen es completamente una mera representacin de aquella mensajera de Dios.    Con esto concluyo yo, que todos somos santos, que su uso no es para la idolatria y depende claro, de nosotros ejercer ese don o no, instruirnos etc. y que como tambien dicen "BENDITA LA IGNORANCIA, QUE HACE VER A OTROS, LO QUE A SUS OJOS SON COSAS MALAS, MIENTRAS QUE A OTROS, SON BUENAS".|`|81fcfe3e6f920e61acf774e5b6febc37aa	PUes la ignorancia es el factor principal, y eso los lleva a una idolatria pura.|`|b6a60a797832460a33bd335fcb3b954eaa	De la misma creacion de la imaginacion de los hombres.  No es Biblico.  Ademas va encontrar los mandamientos.  Cosa que Dios ha prohibido a la humanidad.    Segn la Biblia (Escritura sagrada de los judos y los cristianos) el profeta Moiss (aprox. 1250 a.C) dijo haber recibido directamente de manos de Yahveh, "escritas con su dedo", una lista de rdenes o mandamientos que los israelitas deban respetar. El nombre declogo, con que suelen designarse, procede de la frmula griega ?? (dekalogos) con que se citan en la Septuaginta, la versin griega tradicional, tanto en xodo 34:28, como en Deuteronomio 10:4.    Segn las escrituras, Moiss estuvo en el monte cuarenta das y cuarenta noches y en ellos le dio Dios escritos en dos tablas de piedra los diez Mandamientos. Cuando bajaba, vio al pueblo que estaba adorando al becerro de oro y enfadado las rompi. Pero posteriormente, volvi a subir y pidi a Dios que perdonase al pueblo y sellase con l la alianza. Entonces, el Se?or pidi a Moiss que tomase dos planchas iguales de piedra y en ellas le mand escribir o escribi las diez palabras de la alianza.    El libro del xodo (20:1-17) contiene la siguiente narracin y enumeracin:    1 Entonces Dios pronunci estas palabras: 2 Yo soy el Se?or, tu Dios, que te hice salir de Egipto, de un lugar de esclavitud. 3 No tendrs otros dioses delante de m. 4 No te hars ninguna escultura y ninguna imagen de lo que hay arriba, en el cielo, o abajo, en la tierra, o debajo de la tierra, en las aguas. 5 No te postrars ante ellas, ni les rendirs culto; porque yo soy el Se?or, tu Dios, un Dios celoso, que castigo la maldad de los padres en los hijos, hasta la tercera y cuarta generacin, si ellos me aborrecen; 6 y tengo misericordia a lo largo de mil generaciones, si me aman y cumplen mis mandamientos.    Como ves si leyeran las sagradas escrituras;  tener imagenes de santos, virgenes, esto es encontra de Dios.|`|e6ab1b54d41e1706252683accbeaa473aa	muy buena pregunta, me gustaria saber la respuesta, de donde sacan todas esas imagenes y por que las veneran, les ronden culto, si de verdad siguieran lo que dice la bibia, no lo harian, ya que dice q no habra figuras de oro ni madera, ni de lo que hay en el cielo, ni en la tierra, ni bajo las aguas, muchos dicen q no se les adora, solo venera, pero es lo mismo, les ronden un culto q no deberia ser, gran contradiccion de la iglesia catiloca.segun dicen q por ue son intersesores ante Dios, cuando el unico intercesor es su hijo Jesus, ademas que  para eso nos ense?aron la oracion del padre nuestro, asi q alguien me explique.|`|IXZW0etoaa	yo creeo que el ser humano siempre ha sido falto de fe, siempre a tenido el dicho de santo tomas, "hasta no ver no creer" y es por eso que se hacen idolos, imaganes, y seles incan a cosas que no tienen ningun poder y que bien explicado estan en la palabra de dios.     al dios que yo le sirvo y el esta vivo y no es de madera ni de ceramica ni de oro ni plata. . . . . el es un dios en espiritu que creeo los cielos y la tierra y nos diosla vida a todo ser viviente    salu2

A la falta de gua en sus vidas, gua verdadera, que se perdi cuando Adn y Eva se revelaron contra las disposiciones de Dios en el Edn, el humano perdi el favor y la gua divina, el hombre y la mujer quedaron en manos de la serpiente (el diablo y gobernante de la tierra).  Los guas religiosos de ese tiempo ( y los actuales), tomaron las riendas del bienestar espiritual de las personas y comenzaron a darse cuenta que esa carencia interna de la gente les dara buenas ganancias.    Dejaron de lado la adoracin pura y comenzaron adoptar ritos, festejos, celebraciones y creencias paganas, romanas, etc. y empezaron a disfrazarlas de doctrinas de Dios (pasaron a ser ...apostlica y romana, por sus festejos paganos).  Hasta la fecha se han pasado de generacin en generacin y todava se celebran muchas fechas en el mundo, con la creencia de las gentes que son doctrinas de Dios, pero su falta de cuidado, su carencia de estudio  conocimiento acerca de Dios y sus mandatos reales, contenidos todos en La Biblia, su pereza por buscar, por empaparse, por saber , por escudri?ar, hacen que busquen "quien les alague los odos", en otras palabras estn en las iglesias que les permiten entrar a ellas golpearse el pecho, confesarse, salir de all y seguir haciendo lo mismo, pues saben que pueden volver a entrar las veces que quieran, "mientras den su cuota" pueden pasar.    Ya no es ni siquiera la falta de la gua de Dios lo que les interesa, lo que buscan es un lugar en donde no se les pida cambiar para ser aceptados por Dios.  Prefieren la aceptacin humana que no salva, a la aceptacin Divina que da vida eterna, por lo tanto a los falsos clrigos se les facilita el enriquecerse a sus costillas y el manipular a las masas, pues no tienen que esforzarce para sacarles el dinero, basta con alagarles sus faltas y hacerlas pasar como buenas para seguir dentro del baile y ms ricos.   Ms te digo:     No veas ni participes de ese festn satnico, espera con aguante, paciencia y fe en la vida que realmente lo es y en la llegada de Jess y sus ngeles, para que seas liberado de este mundo de perdicin y falto de Dios y amor entre s ,   Mantente alerta espiritualmente, apegado a las fieles normas de Dios que se encuentran en Su Palabra y que no cuestan nada y te salvan de la destruccin que ya tenemos encima, pues estamos viviendo en los tiempos del fin, el Har-Magedn est llegando, slvate t y tu casa y deja a lo dems a los Testigos, para que ellos traten de ayudar a todo el que est dispuesto a recibir el verdadero conocimiento que se encuentra en La Biblia.     Que Dios te ayude pues nadie ms puede y si puedo darte algo de conocimiento, estoy para servirte.

cbab8cf6cbff73e256bc7fcb24171af8aa	la ciencia aun esta lejos de descubrir el origen del universo pero esta muy acertada hasta ahora en sus conceptos sobre la creacion, estan ademas mencionados en el genesis de la biblia. sobre la religiosidad estoy de acuerdo contigo, pero Dios, o sea el universo entero, no se reglamenta ni rige por religion alguna. Pasa que el concepto religioso ha sido tan inculcado en tantos que muchos aborrecen todo lo que se refiera a aceptar a Dios, inclusive mucho de los cientificos buscan negarlo en lugar de buscar la concordancia ( que existe ), en fin, te sugiero que leas. yo estoy convencido y se donde va llegando la ciencia con la investigacion y eso me convence mas. Suerte.|`|J5hwCW9vaa	Fijate que seria interesante que se lograra descubrir ese enigma porque a mi muy humilde opinion los religiosos no deben descartas las teorias cientificas solo porque en la biblia no estan registradas, porque ni ellos mismos saben como dios creo al universo, por lo que las teorias del bing bang o de la gran explosion, entre otras son propuestas de como pudo haberlo hecho porque no creo que asi nada mas lo hubiese hecho (para los que creen en dios claro) tuvo que haber utilizado "elementos" aunque de una cosa estoy seguro el sistema religioso creo que va a seguir existiendo durante mucho tiempo mas ya que es una buena forma de los gobiernos para influenciar a la gente y a las iglesias para ganar dinero, por lo que no seria conveniente revelar cierto tipo de informacion como algunas que todavia no se han dado a conocer....    Saludos y ahi te va una estrella de mi parte xD.  Nefi|`|I7qCBEUsaa	Estoy seguro que si la ciencia llegase a descubrir el origen del Universo, todos los cientficos se arrepentiran y entregaran su vida a Dios el creador de todas las cosas. Creo que se requiere mucha ms f para creer que el Universo es el resultado de una explosin o big bang que creer que es el resultado de un gran dise?ador con una mente infinita, un ser todo poderoso. Creer en el Big Bang es creer que si por ejemplo reunimos un monton de materiales de construccin (bloques, cabillas, cemento, piedra, arena,pintura, madera, vidrio,etc) y le hacemos detonar una dinamita el resultado ser un edificio de oficinas totalmente ordenado, es ridculo no crees?. Los resultados de una explosin son la destruccin y el caos, no un orden sistemtico.Esto es en esencia lo que plantea la teora de la Gran explosin: que la vida ordenada que vemos hoy da fue el resultado de una explosin.Sin embargo a nadien se le ocurriria pensar que detrs de toda buena obra de Arquitectura no esta un arquitecto o dise?ador inteligente que la construy o dise?. El 90% de todos los astrnomos de hoy creen en Dios; Los que han examinado de la manera ms asidua el universo, han llegado a la conclusin de que la mano que lo hizo es divina. Pierre Simon de la Place, uno de nuestros astrnomos ms grandes, dijo que la prueba a favor de un Dios inteligente como autor de la creacin estaba como la infinidad frente a la unidad contra cualquiera otra hiptesis de causacin final; que era infinitamente ms probable que un conjunto de utensilios de escritura lanzados desordenadamente sobre el pergamino produjeran la Ilada de Homero, a que la creacin la hubiera originado cualquiera otra causa fuera de Dios.Sin embargo por muchos siglos los cientficos, encabezados por Isaac Newton aseguraron que el universo era infinito y eterno, y que por lo tanto no hubo principio y por consiguiente ningn creador que lo hiciera. No fue sino hasta principios del siglo veinte cuando se descart el modelo de Newton de un universo infinito y eterno. El factor decisivo fue el descubrimiento de Albert Einstein de la teora general de la relatividad . Esta teora matemtica (1917) pareca demostrar que todo en el universo se aleja de todo lo dems, lo cual indica que alguien o algo debi de haberlo puesto en movimiento en un comienzo. Aun cuando no le gustara a Einstein (por ser ateo), su propio descubrimiento le oblig a admitir que el universo tuvo un inicio y si hay un origen tiene que haber un originador. Pero ahora sabemos, gracias al telescopio Hubble (1929) que la teora de Einstein en verdad era correcta y que todas las otras galaxias del universo realmente se estn alejando de nosotros y que la cantidad de energa utilizable en el  universo est decreciendo. Los cientficos estn de acuerdo en que el universo no puede ser eterno o infinito si se esta agotando. Tendr un fin as como debi tener un inicio. Este principio es lo que se conoce como La segunda Ley de la Termodinmica . Es fascinante saber que los dos descubrimientos cientficos con ms fundamento (La primera y segunda ley de la termodinmica) apoyan la creacin en lugar de contradecirla. La primera Ley de la termodinmica se basa en que la materia se puede convertir en energa (como el calor que resulta al quemar un tronco); no se puede crear energa o materia de la nada, y como sabemos que nuestro universo est formado de materia y energa, estas tienen que haber salido de alguna parte No crees?. Que Dios, nuestro creador,  te ilumine el entendimiento.|`|9f95cc82817573cd279822bef2cb9c4eaa	Yo sigo creyendo, porque para mi, el Padre Creador existe. En lo que no creo es en la sarta de patra?as que las religiones se inventan para manipular a la gente.     Mi amigo, no es necesaria una religin para creer es Dios.     La iglesia catlica insisti en que la Tierra era plana, hasta que Cristbal Coln y ms tarde Fernando de Magallanes probaron  que es redonda.    No es la primera vez ( ni ser la ltima) que la ciencia prueba que las religiones se equivocan, prueba de que solo optan creer en lo conveniente.     Pero tambin ests equivocado si  piensas que la ciencia  descubrir que Dios no existe. Porque con cada descubrimiento, que la ciencia hace, queda comprobado que una inteligencia ha estado detrs de ello.     Prefiero creer en Dios a creer que soy un punto en un lace de dados. Una mera casualidad.     La ciencia misma lo acepta. Se necesitaron, que se cumplieran muchas condiciones ( demasiadas ) para que en este mundo surgiera vida. Se necesitaron muchas otras condiciones para que un mamfero homnido, se desarrollara y evolucionara hasta convertirse en la especie dominante.    Si, en otras palabras, no hay contradiccin entre Dios y la evolucin. El hace uso de la ciencia, para poner al descubierto las ridiculeces de las religiones.     El Padre Creador, permite que la ciencia descubra, no para  que dejemos de creer o para que le olvidemos. Sino para que nos maravillemos en la perfeccin de la creacin.|`|mkRTuHkraa	La religion es de una u otra manera una necesidad de los seres humanos, asi que si seguiria creyendo.|`|dcf58f2eb1f8185cc2f63732683ff1b8aa	Siempre creer y confiar en mi Dios y le pido q` me ayude a no desmayar y q` solidifique mi fe, en el nombre d Jess.|`|KcLjSctZaa	Hi,claro que seguira creyendo, por que se cree con el corazn ,y no importa cuantos descudrimientos haga el hombre todo lo llevara al principio de la creacin .  y si de probara lo contrario creeras tu?dios te bendiga|`|tTcPjRXZaa	seguiria creyendo en dios...ya q eso no va a pasar...dios existe.ahora vos seguirias creyendo???vos crees en dios o sos no creyente????|`|IXZW0etoaa	pues aunque la ciencia diga lo que diga yo creeo que la fe en dios puede mas que la ciencia. . .     o fijate en este ejemplo:  - el titanic fue planeado, construido y revisado por los mejores arquitectos y cientificos.  - el arca de noe fue creada por un hombre que no sabia nada de barcos pero fue hecha con fe en dios.    dime cual de los dos se undio? ; )    sonrie cristo te ama|`|f003111dc574d6b1c67c5c186c8882dfaa	mira mi perfil ve mi ultima pregunta y esa pregunta con su detallado respondera a la tuya     no hay mas palabras que decir al respecto|`|1vj2lFKBaa	No creo que no, pero seguiria teniendo fe en mi mismo.

Snakes as symbols of evil are prevalent throughout Judeo-Christian mythology, most notoriously in the Garden of Eden as a tempter of Eve

They want your contributions.    If there are no religions, do you know what to believe?  If you are not led, do you know where to go?

By the Way in Heb.1:5-9, Heb.13:8, John 1 we read Jesus IS GOD, and its not just enough to as you put it to "join" a religion its not enough to say you believe, in   James 2:19 satan believes in God and trembles, you must  BE-LIVE in God enough to do what He says as it says in   John 14:15, you can find out more free bible lessons www.amazingfacts.org God bless you.|`|FaEn42uKaa	If you choose to believe in god, you'd be better off if you were not part of an organized religion.    If you choose not to believe, that's OK too, since there's most likely no such thing as god or heaven.    Do you really need the incentive of heaven, or the fear of hell, in order to behave well in life?|`|LUAwpjyuaa	You can believe in both, but not have a denomination. I dont. I personally believe what the bible tells me of Christ and God.     It's just a thing you pray and meditate on.|`|4b37fb48e6f3068da9a52c2194a4a309aa	No, of course not.  You don't have to belong to a religion to get into heaven.|`|73868e15f1e5aa2ed714d155caee7577aa	Yes, I find value in all religions and would never want anyone to 'label' me. I've been to all churches (almost) of various faiths. And want to also attend a Buddhist retreat, visit a Jewish church and a gospel church--all b4 this fall.  Of course you can believe in God and Jesus w/out joining a religion.  I believe as long as one believes, does good deeds for others, LOVES and FORGIVES, well, the door to Heaven is atleast half way open for you, don't you think?  Maybe get baptized too.|`|CWGkfXzyaa	yes|`|7a63b8ee399070360c17f8dfb5d8647daa	Yes and you should believe in both, as well as the Holy Spirit.  Jesus is God's son, whom He sent to die for our sins.  Accepting that Jesus died on the cross for our sin is the way to Heaven.  You don't have to claim any certain religion - just be a follower of Christ. :)  God Bless You!!|`|3Z6Z0ga8aa	"Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me...."   John 14:6    The only to heaven is through Jesus. Get saved by exception Jesus in your heart.|`|7XJxrtABaa	We are not saved by which church we attend (or if we attend).    Those who are walking in the Way are in the Body of Christ also known as the Church.    Cults such as RCC and Mormons, etc. all have one thing in common; they deny the diety of Jesus (Trinity) and suplant their church as the authority. Ask them if they can get to heaven without church membership!    But we see in the Bible examples of those who were saved without church membership (and even water baptisim) and no commandment for joining a particular church.    God bless your walk of faith with our Lord Jesus.|`|Age0YGbeaa	You can believe and be nondenominational but you do first have to except the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior and believe in His birth, death & resurraction.|`|soG4z3jEaa	all you have to do is believe god.....anyone can....and everyone should|`|OFm9sFZEaa	I agree completely with Michelle.|`|bd4315af2a7948203f4a1fd236c3449eaa	i am a believer,read Ephesians 2:8-9.|`|bRfPyiqUaa	You have to join a religion.

Man is flawed, you are not.  You do no need religion to know god. You need religion to help you if you can not find your own way.   That does not mean that the religion knows the right way, only that they have a biased opinion of how they think you should do it.|`|motZGQhyaa	I believe you are matured enough to deceide yourself "what is everything and how is everything and why is everything" so deceide by yourself and dont get fascinated by otheers. read books of all the scilptures and look not the followers of the religion who are existing now a days but look at the messengers of god. but if you dont believe in all this then ask yourself whats the reason of your existance and whats the reason of your death and hereafter. remember nothing is without a reason.|`|xVhkCBGMaa	Well, whether you like it or not, you are joining the Christians by believing in God and Jesus.  However, it says somewhere in the bible that Christians should, in fact, be nondenominational and united.  I don't believe you really have to join a certain denomination to "get into heaven" but it might help you become stronger in your faith.  I personally recommend it.      Also, I read somewhere that Jews can still follow their Jewish traditions and still be saved by believing Jesus died for their sins.  Sounds good to me.|`|vohR0xdDaa	No, you don't have to join a man-made religion. God's religion is in James 1:27 which basically says, go love people and keep your own life right. Your phrase is interesting, "make it to heaven." You don't work to get there. It's like a party. It's who you know. If you KNOW the President, he will invite you to a White House function. If you KNOW Jesus, he invites you to heaven. God tells us to believe in Jesus. In Hebrews one, He calls Jesus "Lord" and creator of the universe. So God and Jesus are not TWO gods, but two representations of ONE God. Think of it this way--if you write the word, "WORD" on a paper--that's a word. If you SAY the word, "word" aloud--that's a word. If you THINK the word, "word," it's still a word. The trinity (3 aspects of one God is difficult to grasp), but my son--who has since passed away and is in heaven, explained it to ME that way!|`|hVLBWoAzaa	you do have to join a religion to make it to heaven.  but the important thing is to believe in god, and not associate him with anyone else.   Jesus was a prophet and he was sending a message for god , so he was Not his son or anything like that.  he was just a prophet,  a human being.    http://dabble.com/node/15230808  this is the real story about jesus    "La ilaha ill'Allah ..there is no god but god  god is one,he doesnt have kids,or a wife to say jesus is his son  but were not saying jesus is nothing....  jesus is a prophet,just like prophet mohamed..very welll respected    jesus is not god son..because god is one."
AA12203324	A cathedral is the bishop's home church.  The "cathedra" is the chair from which a bishop officially administers his territory.  So there is normally one cathedral for each diocese.  The bishop is usually associated with a large city but not all cities have a separate bishop.    A basillica, on the other hand, can be anywhere.  It is a large church with a special papal status.|`|AA10976828	cathedrals are usually where the bishop presides. a city is not made a city based on or not having a cathedral.|`|8dfTfkFZaa	Place they make slasher films an make money for tours.|`|a347f0883600af6da9f68b52ce3912c8aa	Catherals are big gaudy churches to show how devoted and how much money the congregation has.

wTXFwvLMaa	si, verissimo tutto,  una buona regola di galateo ed  una delle meno seguite. e' giusta ma oggi si  creata parecchia confusione tra galateo, presunta galanteria, femminismo e simili! l'uomo dovrebbe entrare per primo per assicurarsi che sia un buon posto e che non vi sia nessun individuo poco raccomandabile nella sala e dopo di ch lasciar passare la donna. oggi molte donne fraintendono questo gesto in quanto sembra di vedere in esso una sorta di supremazia maschile, lasciando cos trasparire una storpiatura moderna di principi propugnati durante il femminismo. c' una bella differenza tra galanteria e rivendicazione dei pari diritti e molti lo fraintendono. credo andrebbe seguito un po' di pi il buon galateo al giorno d'oggi, non sono favorevole al ripristinamento del cerimoniale di corte spagnolo, per del buon galateo non farebbe certo male con i tempi che corrono!|`|e982f936151ceccefce6322c9a54559caa	Non lo sapevo...|`|Bzd6Ag5raa	Ciao,  condivido pienamente con la tua considerazione.  Il mio fidanzato si comporta sempre cos e io so che  un buon gesto che si deve fare, ma non lo so quasi nessuno, come dici giustamente tu!  ciaooooooo|`|UASU4EOiaa	Hai perfettamente ragione, io lo sapevo. Ed infatti, non parlando di un ristorante in generale, ma anche uscendo da una stazione, entrando in una casa... prima l'uomo deve vedere se  sicuro, se non ci sono 'pericoli' e poi deve far passare la signora, da cavaliere... io non lancio sguardi di rimprovero in questo caso, anzi mi sento protetta e lusingata!!|`|vJuYIdYNaa	Bravissimo!! Hai proprio ragione, la maggior parte delle persone pensa che sia il contrario, oppure dice che queste tradizioni sono antiquate... a me fa sempre piacere se il mio "cavaliere" entra per primo, ma non  che faccio scenate se non succede|`|akhaNTyCaa	conosco  la regola e svariate volte mi e' capitato di riferirla,ma mi guardano sempre con gli occhi allucinati come se fossi io quella che nn sa nulla..........|`|O34g0Yxuaa	conosco questa regola, ma mio marito no... Entro per prima, devo chiedere io il tavolo al cameriere devo fare io le ordinazioni.... insomma non c' verso di fargli capire che almeno fuori casa voglio essere trattata da principessa!!|`|RtseqRAAaa	Vedi, al mondo esistono donne che amano sentirsi trattare da principesse e altre che amano sentirsi trattare come donne.  Io?  Io sono fra le seconde.  A me non interessa che un uomo mi apra la portiera dell'auto, o che, prima di lasciarmi entrare nel ristorante, si guardi attorno circospetto come fosse un cavaliere del medioevo, per controllare che gli altri uomini presenti siano armati o no (armati di forchetta e tovagliolo, questo  sicuro...).  Un uomo cos lo lascio a quelle donne che, forse conducendo una grama vita, scevra di soddisfazioni, desiderano per un attimo essere al centro dell'attenzione e sentirsi importanti grazie a questi salamelecchi.    Io, invece, mi sento importante ogni giorno, e non certo grazie a queste cerimonie.  Mi sento importante quando vengo rispettata in altri modi: se vengo ascoltata, se chi mi sta di fronte dimostra di avere voglia di capirmi, se quello che faccio viene apprezzato e tenuto in considerazione, se le mie opinioni vengono ascoltate e non sorvolate.   Questo mi fa arrabbiare! La mancanza di considerazione per le donne, non una stupida porta aperta o altri finti gesti cerimoniosi che servono solo a ricreare un'atmosfera da favola, che dura cinque minuti... e poi svanisce appena tornati alle cose VERE.  E sai cos' che mi fa ancora pi arrabbiare? Ancora pi di uomini come te, che fanno domande come la tua?  Mi fanno arrabbiare le donne che ti danno ragione.  Mi fa arrabbiare che non si ribellino a queste scempiaggini, che si facciano attrarre da questi convenevoli privi di costrutto, e tutto per sentirsi importanti nella maniera sbagliata.    Tornando al galateo, lascialo perdere.   E' un bel gioco, io stessa ogni tanto mi interrogo se  meglio mettere il cucchiaio sul piatto in verticale o in orizzontale, ma ti assicuro che non cerco dentro un libro del genere la risposta a come si vive.|`|BD4yDKsHaa	hai mai detto una cosa del genere a una donna?  se lo facesse il mio amore direi ke ha bevuto!!!  noi entriamo sempre mano nella mano, ki entra prima nn importa l'importante  stare insieme e in sintonia.   nn guardare ste cose, guarda i sentimenti l'affiatamento!;)|`|vmHF0153aa	Sapevo del'esistenza di questa regola del galateo .

AA10110751	In Argentina, "chambonear" is a slang verb meaning "to do silly things" This verb expresses its meaning in a not offensive way ( you are a "chambon" is a far more respectful way of saying "you are an idiot")    A "chambon" (silly guy) who does "silly things" (chambonadas) is said to be "chamboneando" (doing silly things) frequently .     Your question was about the meaning of "CHAMBONEA",  It refers to the 3rd singular person of the verb conjugation...    (I) yo chamboneo  (you) tu chamboneas  (he, she, it) El, Ella, [ello] CHAMBONEA  (we) nosotros chamboneamos  (you) ustedes / vosotros chambonean / chamboneis  (they) ellos chambonean      However, nowadays this verb is not so popular as I think it was in the past.|`|IXZW0etoaa	I have never heard that word in spanish, maybe this is a word used for south-american people because each cowntry have diferent words (Mexico, Argentina, Guatemala, Cuba) Etc.

He was a very ardent believer in  Jah (God) and a follower of  Rastafarian principles.  The rejection is in the institutions that divide us and make us believe what we want to believe.  Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and most other monotheistic religions are based on the same principles.  WE allow the details to divide us and we miss the point.  Me personally...I subscribe to the words of Mr. Ziggy Marley...."Love is my religion."

By the way, not all institutions are negative and it is we ourselves that enslave ourselves through sin, not God nor the Church nor religion.

Comunque le offese potrebbero essere segnale di una omosessualit che spaventa. E questo  sinonimo di grossi conflitti interiori che non tutti sanno superare.  Quanti uomini sposati, magari con figli, hanno un amante uomo? Tutte persone che hanno dovuto reprimersi, con sofferenza, e sono destinati ad una vita di infelicit.  La vendetta e momentaneamente gratificante ma non paga...quindi non  bello augurarsi che quelli che offendono gli omosex si scoprano gay a loro volta e si suicidino per la vergogna.

La vita  fatta di scelte dettate dal nostro io + profondo...e se siamo spinti x la felicit verso qualcuno del nostro stesso sesso, che ci ama e ci fa sentire completi, anche andando contro ogni regola sociale/religiosa, scegliendo la strada che + ci appartiene,  possiamo ritenerci davvero degni di vivere la vita come  giusto che sia. se  giusto o sbagliata un attitudine o caratteristica della nostra vita siamo solo noi a dirlo e nessuno ha il diritto di parlare in proposito.  Mi spiace davvero molto sentir parlare ancora di omosessualit come un problema che va risolto o qualcosa di cui vergognarsi. e mi spiace ancora di pi sentire di persone omosessuali che soffrono xk nn sono libere di esprimere loro stessi. sono felice che pian piano la nostra societ stia iniziando ad accettare questo modo diverso di vedere la vita di coppia. molti/e ragazzi/e vivono questa loro caratteristica come qualcosa di cui vergognarsi o da nascondere.

Kinda es lo mismo que "kind of" que siginifica, por ej, "algo", "algo asi como", "un poco", dependiendo del contexto.  Un ejemplo: I'm kinda (o kind of) tired today.

Este criterio se explica en el reglamento para la implementacin de la Convencin de Patrimonios de la Humanidad.    Hasta el final de 2004, los lugares eran seleccionados en base a seis criterios culturales y cuatro naturales, pero ahora solo hay  diez unicos criterios.    En ingls:  To be included on the World Heritage List, sites must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one out of ten selection criteria. These criteria are explained in the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention which, besides the text of the Convention, is the main working tool on World Heritage. The criteria are regularly revised by the Committee to reflect the evolution of the World Heritage concept itself.

Jesus promises the destruction of entire cities and tells some VERY religious people that they are going to a place with their father, the Devil. And that they have no love for God in their hearts. And that if they don't believe in who he is, they will die in their sins ( which is not good to have said about you by him ).    So I believe that it depends how well you see what's written, and who it's written about.|`|AA11234465	[49] Declare  unto My slaves, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful.

The New Testament tells of His coming as a redeemer. Christ is concealed in the Old Testament and revealed in the New Testament. The Bible also tells of Jesus' death, burial, resurrection and ascension back to heaven. It concludes by revealing the next events to take place on planet earth. Jesus Christ will reign on earth for 1000 years. Then, there will be a final judgement called The Great White Throne Judgement. Lastly, a new heaven and a new earth will be established. The Bible gives us the plan of the ages from creation to a new creation. Revelation 21 and 22.|`|Io9288c7aa	The Old Testament tells of God's dealings with mankind through one particular race of people, the Jewish nation. It deals with how people had to live in a world run to human ideals and not Gods.  The Old Testament also acts as  time of  creating the right circumstances and conditions for God's promised Messiah to come. (Promised throughout the Old Testament but particually in the Book of Isaiah, and fulfilled as in Galatians 4:4 - 6.)   The New Testament tells of the coming of God's long promised Messiah, Jesus to all and not just the Jewish people, and thus lays out the groundwork and plan for God's ideal way of life for all mankind, and not mankind's like in the Old Testament.     Thus the New Testament compliments and fulfills the Old Testament rather than replacing it.     Another reason why people should read the whole of the Bible and more than once too.|`|WspAbTraaa	I don't even know why they publish the Old Testament anymore... it's SOOO wrong about everything, and Christians don't even have to follow it anymore.     They should at least put it at the back, so it's not the first thing people read when they pick up a Bible.|`|zpqZX4QQaa	Look its pretty simple dude.    The Jews were coming out of Egypt.  They needed a place to stay.  So God gave them the Promised Land.  However, this place was inhabited by murderers, theives, whoremongers, pedophiles, and the like.  Not the type of people you want living in your neighborhood. So God, being a Justful God, ordered their destruction, due to their disobedience.  So the Jews slayed every last one of them as God Commanded.    The New Testament era, the Jews were starting to act just like the people that were slaughtered.  So God sent His Son to die on the Cross to save them instead of slaughtering them.     He changed His Parenting skills...your not a parent are you?|`|AA12383652	I think the Old Testament covers a much broader time period and so that has to be taken into consideration.    There was just as much destruction after biblical times.  Think of all the wars and destruction fought after the time of the New Testament.  If the same time period was applied to the New Testament, it would probably be just as violent.    God in the Old Testament enforced laws very strictly because the Old Test people needed to be led to the gospel more like children with very strict specific instructions.  In the New Testament Christ brings a new way of worshipping and following Gods word.  Gods people were given freedom to worship according more to their conscience and what they felt would bring them closer to God.  It was considered a higher law.  It would be like getting rid of a 17 year olds curfew because you feel he is old enough to know when to come home at a reasonable  hour.  He still has to come home at a reasonable hour, but it isnt exactly at midnight.  This was the big difference btwn the law of moses and Christ new law.|`|wXdhwHd2aa	The only thing I know about the New And the Old Is that the old one was Before Jesus.

Many theologians believe that the main difference between Old Testament God and New Testament God is prozac.|`|vj5RYXmNaa	The NT is merely a fulfillment of prophecy in the OT - like the plan of an estate and one of the houses on the estate.  One can look at the plan and visualise the house or look at the house and verify the plan.    God's anger or vengence is aimed squarely at Satan and his minions.  God had to keep His people spiritually pure and this meant weeding out people who didnt obey Him such as Saul or permanently removing the offspring of Satan (Genesis 6). if you take a careful look you will perceive this 'spiritual' cleansing throughout the Bible.  Because of this we can be spiritually pure before Him.    So this is the God of both the OT and NT with the NT showing just how great God is:  His prophecies come true and He looks after His children.  Remember there are many other prophecies that have come true even within the last century that can be traced back to the OT and verified by history such as the shutting down of the Vatican and it starting up again.    God is our father.  Would you not kill or at least permanently disable robbers who came to steal and kill your children?    It is all about spiritual purity so we can be reconciled to Him one day as the ultimate goal of His project plan as described in the Bible.|`|WqYxoA0Saa	My dear because both books are not from god they are full of lies thats why you see much diffrences and there are more evdinces if you want     you can contact me and we will talk     My dear friend the true religion is islam dont believe what thy say about it     if you truly want to find thetruth then contact me|`|cURQvlMIaa	I liked the answer about God changing His parenting techniques.  He gears His methods to be pertinent to the specific children He is dealing with at the time.  This is exactly how I perceived the differences in the OT and the NT.      What most people don't realize is that those nations that God commanded to be destroyed were foul, foul, foul!!  They practiced idolatry, human sacrifice, and every kind of sexual perversion imaginable, and they rejected God.  That is why He commanded even the animals and children to be killed.  He knew that even the animals and the children would retain a memory of those abuses and perpetuate their behaviors if they had been permitted to live.  Although the children were innocent, they would have returned to God and obtained relief from the mental anguish those horrible practices which had been performed upon them would have produced during their lifetimes.   Nothing angers God more than abuses of innocent young children.    Things going the way they are, we will soon see the wrath of God and destructions on a huge scale of the wicked who adhere to similar practices.  The only reason it isn't happening right now is because the righteous are interspersed side by side along with the wicked, and they will have to be lifted out from among them before He will remove His hand from being stayed.  Plus, the gospel has to be preached to every kindred, tongue and people so they have a chance to repent, and that work isn't finished yet.

4fTiCNiKaa	The term sola Scriptura or the Bible alone is a short phrase that represents the simple truth that there is only one special revelation from God that man possesses today, the written Scriptures or the Bible. Scripture states this concept repeatedly and emphatically. The very phrase It is written means exclusively transcribed, and not hearsay. The command to believe what is written means to believe only the pure word of God. What is at stake before the All Holy God is His incorruptible truth.    The Bible is the inspired Word of God and is to be accepted by Believers as our only INFALLIBLE guide and rule of our faith and practice.    Hope this helps,    Elder Greg|`|AA10976828	sola scriptura=scripture alone    a false doctrine that is not even professed in the scriptures.   it claims all we need is the bible ie it is our sole source of authority. there is no evidence of such a belief for over 1800 years of christianity. the first christians professed nothing of that nature and neither does the bible.     http://catholiceducation.org/links/searc...  http://www.scripturecatholic.com/scriptu...    the two links above go into more detail and debunk this false doctrine.     i by no means trying to say scripture is not  important, it is, the catholic church teaches that,the catholic church even wrote and compiled the scriptures.|`|f3e5e7ade17e019e06a1f36bd4b223c4aa	It means Scripture only, as opposed to Scripture AND Tradition.

It is the doctrine that believes that we can only rely on Scripture, the Bible, to help us grow in our relationship with God.

"But when He, the Spirit of Truth, has come, He will teach you all the truth. For He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He will hear he will speak, and the things that are to come He will declare to you." John 16:13     Most non-Catholic sects declare that the Holy Spirit is 'teaching' them the truth. However, there can be only one truth. Since the advent of Sola Scriptura and individual interpretation of Scripture, how can the Holy Spirit be in each of the thousands of sects, teaching all of them opposing viewpoints? It is to be noted that all of the following denominations teach from the same Bible, so why the differences in teaching?    1. How can the Holy Spirit tell the Lutherans the Eucharist is the true presence of Christ, and then tell the Baptists it is only a symbol?    2. How can the Holy Spirit tell the Methodists it is alright to have female ministers, and then tell the Baptists it is unbiblical?    3. How can the Holy Spirit tell the Seventh Day Adventists that Saturday is the day of worship, and then tell the Presbyterians the day of worship is Sunday and not Saturday?    4. How can the Holy Spirit tell the Lutherans that the Blessed Virgin Mary was and remains always virgin, and then tell the Baptists she had other children?    5. How can the Holy Spirit tell the Baptists, 'once saved always saved', and then tell the Church of Christ that Sola Fides is unscriptural?    6. How can the Holy Spirit tell Episcopalians to baptize infants and then tell Pentecostals infant baptism is invalid?    7. How can the Holy Spirit tell Mormons that the Holy Trinity is three separate persons, and then tell Methodists the Trinity is three persons in one GOD?    I could go on and on with the differences between non-Catholic sects, but I think you get the point. It takes only a minimum of common sense to realize that the Holy Spirit could not be speaking to each and everyone of those thousands of non-Catholic sects in the opposing ways of which I have sampled here. However, I was recently reminded that common sense is not so common anymore. It is easy to see that the 'fruits of Sola Scriptura' are not from GOD. There is no 'one fold and one shepherd' in Protestantism. Opposing teachings in these denominations is rampant, all caused by the false doctrine of Sola Scriptura and its accompanying 'individual interpretation' of Holy Scripture. Which, if any, of these sects is being taught all of the truth, as promised by Jesus Christ in John 16:13?    "And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom GOD has given to all who obey Him." Acts 5:32    Okay, GOD Himself has thrown down the gauntlet...TO ALL WHO OBEY HIM.  So who obeys the will of GOD? Is it the Lutherans who say the Holy Eucharist is the 'True Presence' of Jesus Christ incarnate, or is it the Baptists who say, 'It is only a symbol'?  Is it those who say we have to worship on Saturday or is it those who say worship on Sunday?  Is it those who say baptize infants or those who say not to?

(let US go down?) this is the trinity as early as genesis.  now lets move ahead to the prophet zechariah 2:10 "Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,"declared the LORD. many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become my people. Then i will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you."    well there you have it. 5 stars plox?    wait i didnt read the whole question.

1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	That's because you are a poser. What's dressing metal? And only "sometimes" you dress metal? Dude, you are such a poser. I bet you don't know a rock band from your butt crack. I listen to rock and metal more often than not, and nobody thinks im emo. That's because I don't pretend to be something im not, and because I actually know my stuff when it comes to music. Most rock and metal music isn't even depressing, it's uplifting to my ears and eyes. Even bands like Staind aren't emo at all, dumba** people just listen to the ballads and automatically assume that it's depressing suicidal music, but listen to the dam* lyrics every once in awhile, and you'll see that it's not. My favorite band is The Mars Volta, and they'll destroy any stupid little "emo" band out there, if there even is one. Emo is a term losera** people came up with so they could have their own label at school other than being called losers all the time.    Edit: What's wrong with slipknot? Just cause a bunch of turds over obsess with them doesn't mean they are not a good band. I give you props for listening to Zeppelin. Since you put it that way, then I guess the kids at your school are just teasing you about liking rock and metal. There is nothing wrong with you wearing t shirts with your favorite bands on them. You should give them crap for wearing shirts with "bebe" and "hottie" and stupid bullcrap like that. At least your shirts show something that you believe in and care about. So don't worry about what anybody else says about you, you could listent to whatever music you like, and in this case, you made a great choice. SO ROCK ON little sista!

The Second Gospel, like the other two Synoptics, deals chiefly with the Galilean ministry of Christ, and the events of the last week at Jerusalem. In a brief introduction, the ministry of the Precursor and the immediate preparation of Christ for His official work by His Baptism and temptation are touched upon (i, 1-13); then follows the body of the Gospel, dealing with the public ministry, Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus (i, 14-xvi, 8); and lastly the work in its present form gives a summary account of some appearances of the risen Lord, and ends with a reference to the Ascension and the universal preaching of the Gospel (xvi, 9-20). The body of the Gospel falls naturally into three divisions: the ministry in Galilee and adjoining districts: Phoenicia, Decapolis, and the country north towards C?area Philippi (i, 14-ix, 49); the ministry in Judea and (kai peran, with B, Aleph, C*, L, Psi, in x, 1) Per?, and the journey to Jerusalem (x, 1-xi, 10); the events of the last week at Jerusalem (xi, 11-xvi, 8).     Beginning with the public ministry (cf. Acts 1:22; 10:37), St. Mark passes in silence over the preliminary events recorded by the other Synoptists: the conception and birth of the Baptist, the genealogy, conception, and birth of Jesus, the coming of the Magi, etc. He is much more concerned with Christ's acts than with His discourses, only two of these being given at any considerable length (iv, 3-32; xiii, 5-37). The miracles are narrated most graphically and thrown into great prominence, almost a fourth of the entire Gospel (in the Vulg., 164 verses out of 677) being devoted to them, and there seems to be a desire to impress the readers from the outset with Christ's almighty power and dominion over all nature. The very first chapter records three miracles: the casting out of an unclean spirit, the cure of Peter's mother-in-law, and the healing of a leper, besides alluding summarily to many others (i, 32-34); and, of the eighteen miracles recorded altogether in the Gospel, all but three (ix, 16-28; x, 46-52; xi, 12-14) occur in the first eight chapters. Only two of these miracles (vii, 31-37; viii, 22-26) are peculiar to Mark, but, in regard to nearly all, there are graphic touches and minute details not found in the other Synoptics. Of the parables proper Mark has only four: the sower (iv, 3-9), the seed growing secretly (iv, 26-29), the mustard seed (iv, 30-32), and the wicked husbandman (xii, 1-9); the second of these is wanting in the other Gospels. Special attention is paid throughout to the human feelings and emotions of Christ, and to the effect produced by His miracles upon the crowd. The weaknesses of the Apostles are far more apparent than in the parallel narratives of Matt. and Luke, this being, probably due to the graphic and candid discourses of Peter, upon which tradition represents Mark as relying.     The repeated notes of time and place (e.g., i, 14, 19, 20, 21, 29, 32, 35) seem to show that the Evangelist meant to arrange in chronological order at least a number of the events which he records. Occasionally the note of time is wanting (e.g. i, 40; iii, 1; iv, 1; x, 1, 2, 13) or vague (e.g. ii, 1, 23; iv, 35), and in such cases he may of course depart from the order of events. But the very fact that in some instances he speaks thus vaguely and indefinitely makes it all the more necessary to take his definite notes of time and sequence in other cases as indicating chronological order. We are here confronted, however, with the testimony of Papias, who quotes an elder (presbyter), with whom he apparently agrees, as saying that Mark did not write in order: "And the elder said this also: Mark, having become interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately everything that he remembered, without, however, recording in order what was either said or done by Christ. For neither did he hear the Lord, nor did he follow Him, but afterwards, as I said, (he attended) Peter, who adapted his instructions to the needs (of his hearers), but had no design of giving a connected account of the Lord's oracles [v. l. "words"]. So then Mark made no mistake [Schmiedel, "committed no fault"], while he thus wrote down some things (enia as he remembered them; for he made it his one care not to omit anything that he had heard, or set down any false statement therein" (Eusebius, "Hist. Eccl.", III, xxxix). Some indeed have understood this famous passage to mean merely that Mark did not write a literary work, but simply a string of notes connected in the simplest fashion (cf. Swete, "The Gospel acc. to Mark", pp. lx-lxi). The present writer, however, is convinced that what Papias and the elder deny to our Gospel is chronological order, since for no other order would it have been necessary that Mark should have heard or followed Christ. But the passage need not be understood to mean more than that Mark occasionally departs from chronological order, a thing we are quite prepared to admit. What Papias and the elder considered to be the true order we cannot say; they can hardly have fancied it to be represented in the First Gospel, which so evidently groups (e.g. viii-ix), nor, it would seem, in the Third, since Luke, like Mark, had not been a disciple of Christ. It may well be that, belonging as they did to Asia Minor, they had the Gospel of St. John and its chronology in mind. At any rate, their judgment upon the Second Gospel, even if be just, does not prevent us from holding that Mark, to some extent, arranges the events of Christ's like in chronological order.|`|df8178189ab234a40f4ea6dbc913f961aa	His audience was the Gentiles.|`|YvxWxJHdaa	Regarding Mark:MARK, GOOD NEWS ACCORDING TO    The divinely inspired record of the ministry of Jesus Christ written by John Mark. This account of the good news about Jesus Christ begins with the work of Christs forerunner, John the Baptizer, and concludes with a report of the circumstances surrounding Jesus resurrection. Hence, it covers the time from the spring of 29 to the spring of 33?C.E.Mr 1:1.    This Gospel, the shortest of all four, is a rapid-moving and descriptive record of the ministry of Jesus Christ as the miracle-working Son of God. Frequent is the use of immediately or at once. (Mr 1:10, 12, 18, 21,?29) The account is almost evenly divided between conversation and action.    Source of Information. Ancient tradition indicates that Peter provided the basic information for Marks Gospel, and this would agree with the fact that Mark was associated with Peter in Babylon. (1Pe 5:13) According to Origen, Mark composed his Gospel in accordance with Peters instructions. (The Ecclesiastical History, Eusebius, VI, XXV, 3-7) In his work, Against Marcion (IV, V), Tertullian says that the Gospel of Mark may be affirmed to be Peters, whose interpreter Mark was. (The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. III, p. 350) Eusebius gives the statement of John the presbyter as quoted by Papias (c. 140?C.E.): And the Presbyter used to say this, Mark became Peters interpreter and wrote accurately all that he remembered, not, indeed, in order, of the things said or done by the Lord.?.?.?. Mark did nothing wrong in thus writing down single points as he remembered them. For to one thing he gave attention, to leave out nothing of what he had heard and to make no false statements in them.The Ecclesiastical History, III, XXXIX, 12-16.    John Mark evidently also had other sources of information. Since Jesus early disciples met in the home of his mother (Ac 12:12), Mark must have been acquainted with persons other than Peter who had known Jesus Christ well, individuals who had seen him doing his work and had heard him preach and teach. Probably being the certain young man whom those arresting Christ tried to seize but who got away naked, Mark himself was apparently not totally without personal contact with Jesus.Mr 14:51,?52.|`|Of0H9i4Vaa	He was a confident Of Peter......By the way this is a mostest good Question,I ment bestest good Question, well any way could we agree that the mainest thing is,While the good news according to Mark would interest and benefit Jewish readers, apparently it was not written specifically for them. It seems to have been composed primarily for non-Jewish readers, especially the Romans. Its conciseness and abrupt character have been viewed as particularly suitable for the intellect of Roman readers. Latin terms are sometimes transliterated into Greek, as when the Greek word prai?tori?on is used for the Latin term praetorium. (Mr 15:16, Int) Also, the Greek word ken?ty?rion is employed for the Latin word centurio, an officer in command of a hundred soldiers.Mr 15:39, Int.    The account contains explanations that would not have been necessary for Jewish readers. It indicates that the Jordan was a river and shows that the temple could be seen from the Mount of Olives. (Mr 1:5; 13:3) It mentions that the Pharisees practiced fasting and that the Sadducees say there is no resurrection. (2:18; 12:18) This Gospel also explains that the Passover victim was sacrificed on the first day of unfermented cakes and that Preparation was the day before the sabbath.14:12; 15:42.  The composition of this shortest of the Gospels is credited to this Mark. He was a coworker with Jesus apostles and one who placed his own life in the service of the good news. But Mark was not one of the 12 apostles, and he was not an immediate companion of Jesus. Where did he get the intimate details that make his account of Jesus ministry really live from beginning to end? According to the earliest tradition of Papias, Origen, and Tertullian, this source was Peter, with whom Mark was closely associated. Did not Peter call him my son? (1?Pet. 5:13) Peter was an eyewitness of practically all that Mark recorded, so he could have learned from Peter many descriptive points that are lacking in the other Gospels. For example, Mark speaks of the hired men that worked for Zebedee, the leper entreating Jesus on bended knee, the demonized man slashing himself with stones, and Jesus giving his prophecy about the coming of the Son of man with great power and glory while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives with the temple in view.Mark 1:20,?40; 5:5; 13:3,?26.    ?Peter himself was a man of deep emotions and so could appreciate and describe to Mark the feelings and emotions of Jesus. So it is that Mark frequently records how Jesus felt and reacted; for example, that he looked around upon them with indignation, being thoroughly grieved, that he sighed deeply, and that he groaned deeply with his spirit. (3:5; 7:34; 8:12) It is Mark who tells us of Jesus sentiments toward the rich young ruler, saying that he felt love for him. (10:21) And what warmth we find in the account that Jesus not only stood a young child in the midst of his disciples but also put his arms around it, and that on another occasion he took the children into his arms!9:36; 10:13-16.     Some of Peters characteristics are to be seen in Marks style, which is impulsive, living, vigorous, vital, and descriptive. It seems he can hardly relate events fast enough. For example, the word immediately occurs again and again, carrying the story along in dramatic style.    ARE you always in a hurry? With little time for reading? And yet, would you like to grasp the essentials of Christs life and teaching quickly, without being bogged down in theology or philosophy? In other words, would you like the Christian message in a nutshell? Then take a Bible and read the book of Mark. We say book though it occupies only about 25 pages of a standard Bible. And why do we say Mark, rather than the other Gospel writers Matthew, Luke and John? Because Marks is the most concise and action-packed of the four Gospels or good news biographies of Jesus Christ.    The spirit of Marks Gospel is evident in the very first chapter where he uses the Greek word euths, at once or immediately, 11 times. He constantly transmits a sense of immediacy and urgency to Christs activity by using that word 42 times throughout his written record.    Early in the first chapter Marks account has Jesus baptized by his cousin John in the river Jordan. By verses 16 to 21, Christ is choosing the four disciples who accompany him in his first preaching tour of Galilee. Of the first two, Simon and Andrew, who were fishermen, we read: And at once [euths] they abandoned their nets and followed him. Then Jesus picked out James and John, who were mending their nets with their father, and without delay [euths] he called them.Mark 1:10-43.    Marks distinctive action-style is further illustrated by the account in chapters nine and ten where he describes the crowd as running up to Jesus and, later, running together upon them. The inquiring rich young ruler ran up and fell upon his knees before Christ. Only Mark, of the synoptic Gospel writers (Matthew, Mark and Luke), mentions the running in these cases.Mark 9:15, 25; 10:17; compare Matthew 19:16 and Luke 18:18.    Who Was Mark?    Now you might be asking: Who was Mark? Was he an eyewitness to the events he describes? Or did he have some other sources of information?    Evidently Marks mother, Mary, was a believer and allowed her home to be used for Christian gatherings. We also know from the book of Acts of Apostles that he went out into the missionary field as a companion of his cousin Barnabas and the apostle Paul. He was not an apostle or an eyewitness to many of the events he relates. Possibly, he was a disciple at the time Jesus was arrested, some scholars identifying him as the certain young man who got away naked on that occasion.Acts 12:6-17,
AiFRVoq4aa	Our legal system would consider people who act under pain of death to be "under duress" and would not hold them responsible because their free will was severely restricted.    Threatening someone with Hell is worse than death, so it definitely takes away free will.|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	Free will means simply that:  a choice.  The opposite of a choice is force.      I think the underlying message of this idea is that people want to define free will as being to not choose God's way and still have the rewards of eternal life, or similar.  So, contradictorally, God is acknowledged because we have the choice to accept Him or not, but not necessary, because we can choose other things and not face any consequences, thus, what's the point of Him?    Hogwash.  This is classic "have your cake and eat it too".  All life owes its existence to Him.  Period.  Without God, there is nothing.  So therefore, it rightly works out:  God (life), or no God (death).  He's not holding anyone hostage; He's trying to give you the very thing that is itself the reason why He created you:  love.    The question is, do we love Him in return?    God bless.|`|x7J9JNmMaa	You holding a gun is different. Your forcing some one to say yes but God isn't. He is giving us a choice.

Call it "free will under severe (although imaginary) compulsion."  I mean, I COULD tell you that you were ugly even with both barrels cock'd at my temple, right?  Of course, with Christianity, the "gun" (at least nowadays) is nothing more than a set of rhetorical threats.    And inevitably somebody quotes John 3:16.  That's just the rhetorical promise that counterbalances the rhetorical threat - anything to get you to do what they say!  And considering his thumbs up, I wear my thumbs down here as a badge of honor.    "A teacher gives his students a test. Each student is free to pick the answer he or she likes. But if they pick the wrong answers the teacher is still going to fail them."  Sorry, but all such comparisons are absolutely bunk.  The hypothetical teacher is never supposed to be all-knowing, all-powerful, and boundlessly beneficent.  To such a Being, any "failings" on the part of His creation are quite evidently of His own intent - and "free will" on the part of any lesser being is only an illusion.  If such a Teacher's students fail, it's because He wanted them to fail - period.|`|kHSj0ZOFaa	Biblically, free will is not "would you like an apple or an orange"?, where the choice is between two good scenarios.      In fact, God has made the choice so obvious, that we should run immediately to the right choice.      Jesus said that hell is real and it is eternal torment. But nobody has to be sent there.     Death brings immediate heaven or hell, depending on whether you believed the Gospel in this life or not. The only way to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to eternal hell is by believing the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this life.     Salvation is a free gift that happens in a split second of time! You can't work your way into heaven. The truth is that the Bible makes how to go to heaven clear and easy. The only way to be saved and go to heaven and not the eternal lake of fire is by believing in this life that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose again (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you are saved! It doesn't take a lifetime. It takes only a second in believing the Gospel.     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose again. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die :)|`|zs2k9FvDaa	Yes it is free will.

If we look at how Hell is spoken of, we can conclude that Jesus was painting a picture of "the worst possible thing you can imagine" to the poeple of his time. To step back and analyze this, it may be safe to say that "Heaven" is an afterlife WITH God in it, connected to him. "Hell" is an afterlife knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that God exists, but that you are not connected to him, thus WITHOUT God. Does that mean you'll be burned and tortured? I don't think that is an actual conclusion. We may get everything we ever wanted only to realize that it's not what we really wanted, and the material things we are stuck with for all of eternity are what we traded God out for.    This quesion can't be fully explained in this setting. Here is another way to look at it...    Your hiring someone to work for your company but you know that you can't hire someone who is corrupt or the entire company and everyone in it will suffer from the corruption. So you place candidates in a "mock" setting to interact and work over the period of a year. You can see Everything they do, but they don't know that. They know very little about what they are suppose to do and they believe the goal of the setting is something totally different than the actual goal of displaying a clean an pure character and heart.    If you were that person, would you act ANY differently if you could actually see cameras monotoring your actions that you would if the cameras were hidden and you never knew for sure? Wouldn't a better display of who you really were at heart be shown when you had no idea anyone was watching?    This isn't the best analogy, but please try and see the main point. Free will is our opportunity to show God if we can actually make it in His presence, if we really want to obey Him or follow whatever rules there may be if any in Heaven. If not, that's OK, but we can't come in Heaven to ruin it for everyone who wants to be there and can follow the rules without question. Hell is simply the seperation from God that is worse than fire and brimstone raining down on you.     There are so many answers, but for you, what you need to do is take time to really study and read between the lines and see for yourself how it does make sense and how it is more than a simple solution or answer, but rather very deep. Ask God to guide you in the answers you seek and when your ready, they'll be provided for you...    Peace & Love|`|AA11272456	Yes, it is really free will.  Free will, fundamentally, means the ability to choose - to make a choice irrespective of the results or consequences of the choice.    Many want to redefine the phrase free will in the light of results but that is not the meaning.  Moreover, there are those who focus on the adverse consequences (if you choose this you will die) but ignore the beneficial consequences (if you choose this you will live).    Free will is the ability and opportunity to choose - no more no less.  It has nothing to do with the outcome. God kindly and firmly informs us of the outcome for whatever choice we make. But the fact that we can make a choice is the free will.    To suggest that we ought to be able to choose this or choose that and still enjoy life no matter our choice is to inject our subjective - and, quite frankly, self-serving - definition onto a phrase that already has a definition.  We do not get to set the standards.  That is God's job.  The clay cannot say to the potter, why did you make me this way?    "O man, who, then, really are you to be answering back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him that molded it, Why did you make me this way? What? Does not the potter have authority over the clay?   Romans 9:20-21.

It does not mean you have free license to do whatever you please.  And there are enticers not just threats.  Hell is about 10% of the doctrine.  So that's like 10% of a gun held to my head.

We see Criss Angel and David Blaine doing what they purport to be "Street Magic," but then it brings up the thoughts in laymen's minds that either street magic can only be achieved under heavily controlled and post-edited conditions, or that street magic consists of near-impossible impromptu miracles, such as reaching through windows, levitating four feet up in the air, etc, thus ruining it for live entertainers ("CAN YOU FLY LIKE CRISS ANGEL??").    Then there are traditional magicians like that define street magic as nothing more than close up magic being done in a public area.  Whoopee.    And finally there are buskers, good old-fashioned buskers, that make their living in the rough surroundings of a real audience, the real hardened performers that know how to control the crazed teens, the grabby drunks, all to pull off one sweet miracle after the other and that, my friend, is the real magic.    So what would I like to see done with magic?  Hopefully less YouTube exposure and commercialization of it.  How do I feel about it in the 21st Century?  So far, I'm loving every minute of it.  The new generation of magicians are coming up with methods that meld with the older ones to give us something truly revolutionary.|`|OUfbS4e9aa	i love street magicians!

AFMo3671aa	I had that language problem too, at home we speak german and we lived in Belgium so he had to go to school in French. I put him in the Kindergarten (he was three years old) and at first he did not speak much but after a few weeks he  spoke French without any problem. I kept on speaking German at home and all outside "speaking" was French. He is now 30 years old and speaks French, German, Dutch, English and a little bit of Spanish. I think that being confronted to several languages in childhood, permits the child to be able to learn other languages more easily later on. Good luck with your little ones and keep speaking Bosnian with both of them, they will learn English at school, and if they have problems, as an English teacher you will be able to help them.|`|2088e7913efb6c9233fdfd44be2bc0a1aa	It is definitely easier for children to learn a new language especially if it's when their very young.You can't master a language overnight.So it's definitely good that your 'her' is starting to pick up the language at a very young age.I say GO FOR IT and good luck with everything!  |`|bRniz11haa	     If think it will be surely a bit traumatising for her.. moving to a foreign country can be difficult for adults too.. however it must be said that children usually learn faster than adults.

fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	I find this interesting ... Nearly every ancient civilization has some sort of art depicting giant reptilian creatures. Petroglyphs, artifacts and even little clay figurines found in North America resemble modern depictions of dinosaurs. Rock carvings in South America depict men riding Diplodocus-like creatures and, amazingly, bear the familiar images of Triceratops-, Pterodactyl- and Tyrannosaurus Rex-like creatures. Roman mosaics, Mayan pottery and Babylonian city walls all testify to mans trans-cultural, geographically-unbounded fascination with these creatures. Sober accounts like those of Marco Polos Il Milione mingle with fantastic tales of treasure-hoarding beasts.     In addition to the substantial amount of anthropic and historical evidences for the coexistence of dinosaur and man, there are other physical evidences, like the fossilized footprints of humans and dinosaurs found together at places in North America and West-Central Asia.    Back to the question of dinosaurs and the Bible ... The English term 'dinosaur' wasn't used until 1840. The Hebrew writers didn't have an all purpose word for large lizards - which is what the word literally means. There are references to living creatures that could be dinosaurs. Possibilities include 'leviathan and 'behemoth'.|`|IXZW0etoaa	because the word Dinosaur was invented more than 1000 years after bible was wrote|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	The dinosaurs had been extinct for millions of years before the Bible was written.  |`|K5L63wbeaa	funny, there's no mention of starfish either!|`|g5FbtzNTaa	They are, show me an animal that has a tail like a cedar tree.

Job 40:15  Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.   Job 40:16  Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.   Job 40:17  He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.   Job 40:18  His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.   Job 40:19  He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.   Job 40:20  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.   Job 40:21  He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.   Job 40:22  The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.   Job 40:23  Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.   Job 40:24  He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares. |`|aGYZANfqaa	1) No-one knew what they were and it would have confused people who read it beforehand  2) I don't think the word dinosaur had even been invented at that point  3) They were probably extinct (but see 5)  4) They didn't help the plot along  5) There are a few passages which refer to creatures which may have been called dinosaurs if around today|`|876b94b64cd91f23a730520bce9055bdaa	The "behemoths" are mentioned in the bible. They simply used a different name. And anyways, it doesn't list off every single creature that was created.

Sometimes there isn't enough room for the winter overflow.

Personal experience; often times you find good people who fell on hard times that really need help. Women and children who are running from abuse.As well as people with mental illnesses  that can not maintain housing and care for themselves.Also alcoholics and drug addicts who can not maintain housing . What ever reason they got to the point of being homeless. No one should freeze to death.    david h; No one wakes up and decides "I will be homeless today". If it was you and your kids that was homeless. Perhaps your daughter who is fleeing an abusive husband. Wouldn't you want someone to help ? Be realistic the government money is your money.

I noticed our gym manager seemed to be watching the guys in their shorts and mentioned this to my partner wondering if "Jerry" was gay.  We found out he is totally straight.  My partner, with many more years of experience ,explained that it is a guy thing to do - to check out the 'manliness' of other guys.  Gay guys might be a bit more overt, espeically when we are with our own (at a bar, pride parade, etc..)      But try this.  Sit near an doorway to the living room or where ever you might be at a party.  Try not to be too conspicuous.   Watch the eyes of the guys as they enter the room.  As they approach another male, even if they know them well, you'll see their eyes dart down to the guys crotch.  It can be just a millisecond....but the eye of the straight men and gay men do take a quick look.    Now then, if you really are gay you'll know a few tricks to really make the straight fellows envious of your stuffed pants.

Later on, if you find that you get other girl crushes but no boy crushes and have trouble dealing with it, contact the gay center or PFLAG.ORG and they can give you a referral to a gay friendly counselor- you'll be able to talk without any fear of prejudices or gossip.  Have a good life|`|utivEuTfaa	Good question, I'm glad I'm not the only one who has felt this way. When I was like 14-15 I went through a phase where I was primarily attracted to girls. I had 2 crushes in particular, one felt pretty innocent like I just had affection for this girl (she wasn't even one of my friends so it was really random) kind of like what you're describing, and the other was very sexual. I never acted on either and then I just kind of outgrew the phase. At other times since then I've felt somewhat open to being intimate with girls, but still haven't acted on it and have a strong preference for guys 99% of the time.   Bottom line is it's perfectly normal and it doesn't mean that you're gay, I think attraction to/curiosity about the same sex is a natural part of sexual development for a lot of people.
lJUyhMceaa	In many cases this is true.  However, what is wrong with a church taking up an offering?  They need money to pay the electric bill to.  Churches have bills to pay just like anyone else does.    When the public school wants more tax money to pay their bills and pay the teachers, nobody seems to have a problem,  or the Government, or the politicians vote themselves a raise.  Why is it ok for them to ask for money to line their pockets but when the local church takes up an offering so the pastor can feed his family, that is wrong????      I agree that there are some out there that are only in it for the money, but you can't judge all of them because of a few bad apples, no more then you can judge all teachers because of a few bad ones...or all police officers because of a few bad ones.

In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.  "The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him."  (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)
UEtwQRCoaa	It will be VERY HELPFUL.  I spent 2 years in high school, and 2 years in college learning Spanish, and consider myself to be fractionally-fluent.  I went to Spain and Italy in 2002.  I was virtually lost trying to understand the Castillian "proper" Spanish there.  I studied 2 pages of Italian, and had a tape.  I actually understood the spoken Italian-which is much slower-BETTER!    Spanish comes directly from Italian, btw.  English was originally from a base of German--both have a regular word order. The Latin was an add-on, via the Bible, and the French kicking some English butt for 100 years, finally defeating them.  The English upper-class used to speak French, but the English culture was so strong, that they reverted to English--only it was now "Italicized."    I write reviews and essays at Epinions.com. My most popular movie review is "Tropic Thunder," my most popular essay is "Three Self-Defense Moves EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW!" and I recommend "How to Find Computer & Electronic Deals Online--EVERYDAY!" These are accessible from http://www.epinions.com/user-kengland4/s...|`|7360955bdb6204c33b9cfd068b9d6cf7aa	my mother tongue is Spanish, but I can watch any Italian movie or show and understand it perfectly, no need to study it in a course. if living in Italy, I'd be able to speak it fluently in just a few weeks.|`|VOJ2mE3Haa	Yes, since the languages are related and many words are similiar to one another you will be able to make connections.

It'd give you some verstaility. Particularly to live in Italy or work in tourism.

It is a fact that ghost exist, many people have seen them. Yet a lot of people still think those who believe in them are crazy. Adults can't see ghosts unless they are gifted. Children can.

It wasn't until Pope John XXIII, in 1959, no less, that the Catholic church "forgave" the Jews for killing Jesus. Now there is talk the church might rescind that forgiveness.

There is no connection between his views and the lifting of the excommunication.    >>which includes traditional prayers for the conversion of Jews to Christianity.    So? Jews are allowed to pray that gentiles stop worshiping idols, but Catholics aren't allowed to pray for Jews to accept Christ? I agree with Rabbi Yerachmiel Seplowitz:    "Where do we Jews get off making demands of Catholics that they only say prayers that meet with our approval?     "Next week is Tisha BAv. Have we forgotten that we are living in exile? The audacity of Jews dictating to Christians how they should pray is simply mind-boggling.     "First off, the request implies that we can influence Catholic theology. Face it: Christians believe they are right and we are wrong. They think we should convert, and that attitude will not change until Moshiach comes.     "And speaking of Moshiach, if we are going to sit down with the Vatican to negotiate liturgy, should we, lhavdil, offer to take out the second paragraph of Aleinu, in which we pray for the day when gentiles will stop worshipping idols? How about 'sheheim mishtachavim'  the line that Christian censors removed from Aleinu, claiming it insulted Christians? Many of us have put it back. Should we allow the Vatican to dictate what we say in our prayers? Or should we, perhaps, do a line-by-line analysis of the Talmud to make sure there is nothing there that people may find offensive?"  http://www.thejewishpress.com/displayCon...|`|37LKDbtsaa	It's shows a lot about the new pope.

This 'Bishop' is obviously delusional and in need of a reality check.    If you read the books of Isaiah to Malachi you will see that the Almighty didn't like His people following the path of the Pagan.  He told them that as long as they followed Him and denied the Pagan worship system they would be under His protection.    But, if they chose to follow the worship system of the Pagan He would kill some, let others go into captivity and scattered them all over the entire world.    The fact that they are NOT in control of the promised land, Jerusalem nor are they all back in their land tells us that the wrath that their choices caused the Almighty to exact upon them is still being issued.    Most of the Jews of today know what their downfall was and it is doubtful that they would take the chance of following a church that practices the same rituals and pagan worship system that God condemned them for and IS still punishing them for participating in.

db8e7b296f02680975367f9a5a801cf8aa	Yes I believe in God and He believes in me. :-)  His only begotten Son died on the Cross for me and my sins.   I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me.     God knows the questions you're going to ask a month from now.   He goes before us preparing the way. So He knows what we're going to do before we do it. Just like He knew you'd ask this question and I'd answer it.   The rest is called free will. God gives free will to everyone. What we do with that free will is up to us.     It's sad when we use our free will wrong. Because we don't realize we will answer about every thing we do and say.     "An evil man is held captive by his own sins; they are ropes that catch and hold him. He will die for lack of self-control; he will be lost because of his great foolishness." Proverbs 5:22-23      None are really lost they just have not asked to be found.     "Today is the day of salvation. Now if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart, but be soft toward Him." 2 Corinthians 6:2 paraphrased    Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen."     John 3:16  16 For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten (unique) Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction, be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life.|`|AA11564934	NOBODY ONLY BELIEVES WHAT THEY SEE!!

I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

Stop blaming God for your problems, Instead try to look for a solution to them. e.g Getting a mathematics teacher, taking some extra time to study mathematics e.t.c.|`|QMbaeva9aa	Lolwut?    God created people. People created math. Yes, by -association- God created math, but the foundations were laid by human brains.    Mathness: Repeating = to infinity. So if you add 0.3333.... to 0.33333... and 0.333333 (so you have three thirds ie 3/3), since they extend to infinity, they add up to one. Infinity, human! Infinity!    Edit: Here's a better explanation.  Let 0.9999.... = x.  10x = 9.999999999999999= 9 + x  Now solve.  9x = 9.  x = 1.  Therefore 0.999999999.... = 1.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Would two and two add up to 4 without numbers? If you couldn't count, would you still see two trees? What would you see?

Math is perfectly rigorous and the language the universe is written in.    3/3 = 0.999999...... which is the same as 1.   There is no difference between 1 and 0.9999999........    Edit:  A Bachelor's Degree is more than enough to answer this question.  This is Junior High level stuff.    Edit:  Well, the 9's go on for infinity.  So 1 - 0.99999...... = 0.0000.......00001.  However, there is an infinite number of zeroes before the 1.  Therefore the 1 technically does not exist because the zeroes go on forever.  That's why 0.99999.... is the same thing as 1; the difference is 0.    Edit:  I know this might be hard to wrap your small mind around, but there is no rounding.  That 1 behind the decimal point never comes up.  It does not exist because there is always more zeroes.  You are the one that is rounding, incorrectly, to claim God isn't perfect.  You're going to have to look elsewhere to prove God doesn't exist because all you are doing here is advertising your ignorance of mathematics.|`|366aa3bbb60558f11aecb9d3750bceb2aa	I would NOT have been mad at him if he had given me a few more brain cells so I could understand math better.|`|AA10351261	No.  Just because you don't understand math isn't Gods fault.

However, there are some interesting points about math.    I think it's interesting that PI or 3.14 begins with whole number 3 as the trinity.  That of all the numbers 3 had the be the whole number representing forever.    I find it interesting the zero multiplied by infinity is 1.  That the Alpha and Omega is 1 - Deuteronomy "Hear ye o Israel, the lord your God is one".   So again, the trinity (3 in 1) and in Deuteronomy, the infinite circles go around what God is.    I also find it interesting that between every number, exists infinity.  Such as, if you shoot an arrow at a target, we call agree it gets half way there first.  But first we agree it has to get half way before half way.  Half way before that.  Halfway before that.  Halfway before that.....  And so forth.  Technically, it never really gets there.    Anyway, just thought I'd share.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	"A BACHELORS in math and you are qualified to answer this Q? Laughable"    An 18 yr old schoolgirl thinks she can dispute it? Pathetic.

The urine gets entangled in the pubic hair  2.  The underwear is not supposed to be there but air cooled and exposed the genitals  3.  bacteria has invaded the area  4.  if we go naked there would be no complications      Believe it or not both men and women have distinct smells.  This is natures designed for atttraction and mating.  When a woman is aroused a certain smell comes out of her genitals and armpits.  Same with men.    Example is the deer.  Female deer excretes a smell that the male deer run after to.  And cohabitate.    Besides, we do not come from fish but from monkeys and apes.  We should smell like monkeys then if your logic is right.|`|AA10852244	No, it will smell like apes since we evolved from apes, and of apes didn't clean they smell like fish.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	I see no evidence that you evolved at all.|`|4dgrwFU4aa	Wait until you get a whiff of evolution.

When you wish you were something else, you're not appreciating the goodness that God gave you and the beauty he gave you...  Remember, God knows the very number of hairs on your head.

I get what you are saying, but I think that there is a midway point that the Universe, God, Allah, Higher Power, et cetera, wants us to be grateful and help each other out at the same time as showing pride and making good things happen for ourselves and our loved ones. Why does it have to be one or the other? Too much of anything can end up not be enough of another. I work towards having the basics for me and my loved ones and to have the ability to chose what I feed my kids and the type of material items that I have while also helping people that do not have as much resources as me, or if there is something I can do to alleviate someone else's suffering or burden, I will do it. So I agree with both sides of your arguement. I do see a lot of "me, me, me" in this world especially in the times we are currently living and that is an example of having more than you need AND not really caring about others who really need assistance. This is just my personal take on the subject. I live a very simple life, with the exception of my computers and technical equipment that I make my living from. I do not take anything for granted. I do not impulse buy. I own one, no wait, two pairs of foot wear, my daughters have nice clothes but not all of it came brand new from the store. We eat nice meals but if I had to put a cost on a typical dinner meal of three, I spend about $5.00 on average. I love a good bargain or price reduction as those funds can be channelled into something else we need. I wouldn't change it for the world. Twenty years ago, I had at one time, 11 credit cards, a condo at the ski resort, Whistler, BC, Canada, a MGB sports car, a great high paying job, the most fab clothes and "bling" and then me and my husband were forced into a recievership with our trucking business and my life was temporarily out of whack. I thought I needed to work at getting these things back a.s.a.p., but instead, I found the lack of abundance was the best thing that happened to me and my family as it has made us who we are today. You do not have to ponder if God (or whomever you chose) wants me to do this over that, I just know in my heart the difference between what we want versus what we need. This was a great question and I love it when a question makes me really delve into my soul to find the answers and that does not happen everyday, especially on Yahoo Answers! Good Luck. Peace;)|`|6bKws0fAaa	very true indeed  sadly this world is not like that  for who is the prince of this world but Satan       but we as Christians [ i hope you are one as well]  should live our lives for God regardless of how others choose to live theirs  so lets set a good example so others can take notice of us and maybe [God willing] become saved|`|lh8Tn02Naa	If only.    I bet you're quite grateful for the hi-tech lifestyle - developments in science, medicine, freedom of travel, mass media etc.    You're using a computer, aren't you?    It is possilble for some, but only some, people to create this kind of self-sufficient rural idyll and if you are one of them, go for it.  But remember, the rest of the world is still there and there'll be times when you'll need it.    But there has to be an alternative to mass consumerism.  The planet can't sustain our present rates of consumption.    You may live long enough for material things to be in much shorter supply than they are now, as non-renewable resources run out.  Will we learn to share them?  or fight over the scarcity that remains?

We want to be better than everyone else.  It's human nature.    There was a study that measured people's greed.  People were offered money and were asked how they would divide it.  If they couldn't come to a concensus about how to divide the money, they would get nothing.  While you would think that most people would have said "divide it equally."  Surprisingly most people said, "give me more." They would rather risk losing everything if it meant that they could get ahead of the other people.  So, while living like the Amish might be better for all overall, most people want more.  And we are never satisfied.    There is some evidence to support that this idea is good.  It goes hand in hand with ambition.  Without ambition we wouldn't have medicine, science, even agriculture!|`|61ddfb6410cdb1fde97533401cf0a601aa	I agree...    but some people can't stand boredom...    so they need to stir up trouble and making people miserable.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	yes it would be, but its never gonna happen!|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	Had not the intuition and creativity linked with intellect in the mind come about, we would have gone extinct long ago in the harsh reality that was the Ice Age.

That not only *was* God's original purpose, but, it remains his goal!    ". . . Evildoers themselves will be cut off,   But those hoping in Jehovah are those who will possess the earth.   The meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace." --Psalms 37:9,11    "For Jehovah is a lover of justice, And he will not leave his loyal ones. To time indefinite they will certainly be guarded; But as for the offspring of the wicked ones, they will indeed be cut off.  The righteous themselves will possess the earth, And they will reside forever upon it." --Psalm 37:28-29    ". . . They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat [their] fruitage.  They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.  They will not toil for nothing, nor will they bring to birth for disturbance; because they are the offspring made up of the blessed ones of Jehovah, and their descendants with them." --Isaiah 65:21-23    "And no resident will say: 'I am sick'. . ." --Isaiah 33:24    "So my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be.

1wNsBNmxaa	Essex    The land of the eastern Saxons, that is how Essex was named. Found in the South East of England the county covers an area of some 1,417 square miles and in Harwich provides a direct link, albeit over the sea, to Holland and the continent of Europe.    The main towns and cities of Essex are Chelmsford, the administration centre of Essex, Colchester, known in Roman times as Camulodunum, Harwich, Tilbury, Clacton and Southend-on-Sea.    Colchester was the earliest recorded Roman town in England and, despite being destroyed by Bodicea and the Iceni tribes, remains a garrison town to this day.    Many historians speculate that Camulodunum gave rise to the legend of Camelot although this is disputed by those favouring areas to the West of England and in Wales.    Essex covers nearly 1,500 square miles and features the former royal hunting ground of Epping Forest (since 1882 controlled by the City of London), the marshy coastal headland of the Naze and the site of London's third airport of Stansted.    Essex enjoys a strategically brilliant position in that it is not very far from the city of London yet far enough to allow for a peaceful existence.

IgztWp0uaa	You father is obviously mentally ill.   You need to draw some boundaries as to what is acceptable behavior and what is not, and he is clearly over the line with the things he is saying to you.  It is time to get some communication counseling and learn to say, " I suppose you have a right to your opinion, and I have a right to be respected. I will talk to you/see you later when you are in a more reasonable mood." And then do not have contact for a week or so if possible.   Since you father is basically unbalanced, all you can do is learn to let those comments go. My mother is a paranoid schizophrenic and makes very hurtful statements and bizarre statements. I had to learn at a very young age that she is her own person and her issues and comments are not a true reflection of who and what I am.  You can't change what your father says and does, but you can change your reaction to his behavior. Please remember, your father is not your "enemy", it is an unfortunate accident of nature that he is your biological father and put in a position in your life that you may have certain expectations of him that he may not be able to actually embrace.  Get some time and space from him and only allow interaction on your own terms. If your mom is still with your father I highly suggest that you visit with her when it is just the two of you. Good luck!|`|4bb8aefb2a2ea8d99c78d3fbc5220586aa	i dont like your father's way of helping you. i'm not saying that i approve your habbits, but your father should be helping you to realise your your sins in a better way.|`|AA10877643	Why would you not forgive someone who is so obviously in error?  Perhaps, you need to forgive yourself.|`|e7SYtaIJaa	Religious or not, this isnt a religious question, this is an abusive relationship, and he needs to be sorted out dude. Just cuz people belong to a religion doesnt mean they are nice people, your dada sounds like a fascist bully boy, that got picked on as a kid.    Report him to your school councillor, make him accountable.    PS. Masturbation is fun and not bad.|`|F8E9JpmSaa	First of all how old are you? If you are of age then move out and sever all communications with him.|`|5iEaHRCoaa	yeahh boy|`|jEYe2GrOaa	there is a difference between forgiveness and staying in an abusive relationship? jesus does not expect you to do harm to urself he hopes, asks and promises that if you have faith in him all things are possible including forgiveness, but this is a process that begins in prayer and only when the abuse stops. pray for ur father and asks god to forgive him as u ask for ur own forgiveness but do it from a respectful distance. respect for urself is also a desire of God, remember "love ur nieghbour as urself", so love urself enough to get out of the abuse.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, you should try and forgive and forget. But at the same time, forgiveness does not mean you have to endure continual punishment and abuse at his hands.  Forgive but part ways with him until he asks for your forgiveness as well. Forgiveness is a two way street.|`|MnCqBqz5aa	OMFG, perhaps you need a long good chat with your father man, cus you really need him to understand your feelings, perhaps he expressed himself wrongly, probrably because he believes in the bible, considering ejaculation as a sin. Explain to him in terms of science may be a positive idea. But traditional fathers like that ain' t gonna dig this.    This is what you should do. Due to the fact that your dad looks down on you. You got to prove to him that he is wrong, we' ll all support you homie. Just believe in your own destiny. Your father gave birth to you, but it was all gods will for you to be the choosen one to be born. Everyone has a free will choice, therefore, your own destiny is in your hands, not your dads. If your dad is doing this to you, fine! Do what you wish to follow in order to be successful in what you like.    Stay strong man, your road is more difficult than others, but during the path, you shall experience more, you will build a more powerfull will inside you. - XD    "Stay strong & Prove your father wrong-"- It' s your life and nuthin' should control you. Keep your will power and mind strong and build it till you succeed and learn from your fathers mistake den take advantage, forming a better destiny in the future, and show him!- ;)|`|CHCPnvksaa	If it brings you inner peace to forgive him, then do so. You may want to ask him why he considers himself a good christian if he is so full of hate. You also may want to consider emancipating yourself too if you're under 18 if he's that abusive. The bible only says "honor your father and mother." It says nothing about having to put up with abuse.     Stay strong honey, and remind yourself that he's the one with the mental issues, not you. Don't ever take anything he says personally. He knows that his words hurt you and that is his way of controlling you because he's insecure about himself.|`|E9chZY74aa	Only you are responsible for what you think. Nothing that is done to you must be a part of your actions or thinking.  God has given you the responsibility to think like Him, no matter what the situation.  Calm yourself, think for yourself.    Now, make a list of problems you need to work on and then get busy on them   If you masturbate all the time or whatever, it is because that is where your mind is.  Clean your mind and then it will clean your life.  Christ said as a man thinks in his heart, so is he.|`|6bKws0fAaa	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"  Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. Matthew 18:21-22    now this does not mean that when your father sins against you 78 times that you should stop forgiving him.  no Christ meant that you should never stop forgiving. I know it's hard man but just as Christ forgave you, you too should forgive your father    the bible also says: forgive and ye shall be forgiven  buddy just hold on and always keep trust and faith in the Lord|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Father and son. Later on they will adjust and come close. One should not get entangled.|`|AA11091234	Yeah you should get out of there.   I know what it's like to be squashed down like that (my ex-boyfriend), after awhile I started treating myself harshly. Life will get better once your around positive influences.    Is there a support group you could go to?|`|AA12346187	you must forgive  him. you can not hate any one and say you are a christian  but if he is  so abusive  I would  leave and break all contact  for now.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Forgiveness may come later, the first thing you need to do is work out how to leave home.  Your father is destroying you and it says a great deal for your courage and your faith that you still seem to be sane and in one piece.    There is no reason to believe anything he says about you.  He's angry, he's upset, his head is full of what he thinks Christianity says about gay people, he doesn't understand your sexuality.   He doesn't deserve you.  He might, in his agitated fashion, think that these shock tactics of his will somehow frighten you into being straight, and that he's using them because he "loves" you, but love is never like this.  He thinks you've let the family down because you won't (probably) be giving him any grandchildren.  I'm not asking you to make any allowances for him, just suggesting why he is behaving so dreadfully.    You can be an achiever.  Being gay is absolutely no barrier to that.  It helps if you're tough but you are coming across as a damn sight tougher than I would have been in your circumstances.    Get some friends together, people who understand you - I'm guessing you won't have to look far - and work out with them how to move on from here, talk about strategies.  Are you at school or college?  There should be someone on the staff who will give you a "good listening to". You shouldn't be alone in circumstances like this, but I think it is amazing you have coped thus far.|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	yes you should forgive him mate ...... forgive him for not being just what you expected and also forgive yourself for not  being what others expected ....... he sounds like one sadsorrylittlesod to me but you do need to forgive him and let the crushing pain and grief go ..... say the words out loud and the healing process will begin ........ i'm not saying love or even like him ..... just forgive him ........ don' let the trauma crush your beautifull spirit ..... you are entitled to the same peace happiness love health and vitality that every single person on the planet is ......... they are basic pre requisites mate and not just the pregorative of a select few.    he is doing the best (albeit a pathetic effort) with the knowledge he has ........ ask him what his relationship was like with his father .......... or mother ...... he is simply parenting you the only way he knows how .......... i'm so sorry that you have to deal with this pain ...... step up and be brave and believe in the power of you.    Buy yourself a book called "You Can Heal Your Life" by Louise Hayes ...... brilliant soul replenishing stuff mate.    you are worth it.    peace baby  ?|`|dl97DmmYaa	Love him more.  This will teach him the meaning of hate.|`|AA11620976	All wrong ! Since he is the abuser it is his responsibility to ask you for forgiveness and you have the CHOICE  of giving or not giving it to him  Personally I think that its perfectly fine to hate him and it's actually good for you  too  My father used to beat the crap out of me on a regular basis [because i had undiagnosed ADD] and I absolutely hated the man.  He's been dead 20 years and my feelings haven't changed and they never will because I had just cause to feel that way and I still do.  You have the same kind of just cause.  One  thing that I never understood about Christians is that despite all of their preaching most of them are incapable of dealing with genuine evil when they run into it.  You are dealing with genuine evil and you need to get away with first and then deal with all of the other issues  later  This question helped me a great deal when I tried to make sense of it all  If your father wasn't your father and just some person that you met socially would you like him ?would you hang  out with him ?would you be friends? or would you see the obvious danger and stay the hell away from him  Before our parents were our parents they were people first and some of those people were really nice and some were evil bastards and fertility can't ever change that   Good luck and stay away from guns b/c contrary to what the NRA thinks guns DO kill people|`|mMPjXbvcaa	You need to do something, or you'll grow up to be the same way.

God understands.  My Dad was the same way except he was religiously obsessive to the point I thought he had a direct connection to God when I was a child. He would beat and mentally torment us. I'd say you would not believe how cruel but you do know don't you?   You are so not a bad person because your gay, no matter what anyone says God knew you in the womb as the scripture says. God knew you were gay and Loved you as his child. So don't let anyone make you believe different or they would be going against God's words in the Bible, right?  Can you leave? If you have mental health problems and cannot live alone there is special homes and apartments you can get into. There may be a waiting list. Get on all of them.   If you are all right on your own try help with housing expense's at the housing counsel or housing department in the state/government pages of the phone book. Waiting lists too. But get on one if you can.   I wish I had words of comfort for you. Just hold on there are others out there in simliar situations. And you can always come on here and talk to all of us when your down and out. That is what I do. It does help. There are a lot of nice, kind, & decent people on here. You will meet some nastys. But the good ones are always around. I think sometimes God sends us hope through them.   Best Wishes & Be Well. Don't give up.   Unto yourself be true.   Remember God is always there for you. :)    EDIT>>>>>>>>>>>> Sorry the wording made it sound as though you were gay.  Your father still has no right what so ever to treat you this way. Your a good man. Take Care.|`|0HLOLwXKaa	You should pray for him.|`|WbaN6osZaa	He's made you feel worthless and for no good reason.  Everybody masturbates, it's normal and healthy.    Your sexual identity is nothing to do with any of this either.      That makes him (your father) an angry and irrational creature.  I advise you keep your distance.  Yeah he's 'holy' alright...A55-holey!     Forgive him if you want, but you've first got to take the monkey off your back that he put there.  DO get counseling.  Your self esteem has been mangled by an abusive person.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	you should leave and forgive your father anyway. he seems unhappy..|`|uz9GtV9vaa	You need to get as far away from your dad as possible!    Aside from that, yes I believe you can forgive anything.    Your dad is mentally ill.  He needs help and you need to get out of the situation.|`|SpGtU5TRaa	Your father sounds like he has his own inner demons, and the things he says to hurt you are just a sign of his own suffering.  People tend to hurt the ones' they love the most.  The things that he's saying to you are terrible, and it would hurt anyone but you need to stay strong.  Get away from him for a while, and when you talk to him over the phone or something tell him that the things he would say to you hurt you. You can't make yourself forgive someone, it has to come with healing of wounds.  You and your father must resolve some deep issues.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Actualy hes being a Godless SOB. Try to live in peace with him and forgive him but he is in the wrong. I lived with a man for whos seed I came from I call him psycho dad. Because thats what he is a liar that calls himself a christian then beats on his wife.    Sometimes peace is not possible with somone who does not want it.      Hope the best for you in lving with him. If you have mother does she treat you like this to?|`|3vG6jxHwaa	Forgiveness may take years.  Some manage to forgive their fathers only after the fathers die of old age.    Even if you are under 18, emancipation would be an option.  If you keep hearing this abuse, you might begin to believe it.    I pray for your health and happiness, and your deep enjoyment of the Holy Spirit. John &:38,39  Holy Spirit will flow from your heart as living water.    Even people in Nazi camps experienced this, so I suppose you could around your father, but removing yourself from his abuse seems a good idea.|`|b7Lo5IAZaa	In time and when you are ready to. You need to work on yourself being healed and overcomeing the hurt. It's a good start by forgiving. Then maybe you can get perspective on how and why he is that way, and truly forgive him fully. It's an admirable goal and even asking the question shows you have more of a heart. I hope you get out of your situation quickly.|`|DYnvacFVaa	Dislike the way he is but not him, pray for God to change him and if you can get out of the situation of living with him.  God can change all people, pray and have faith.  I dont think its a healthy environment to be in.  Dont let the type of person he is effect you being a great person, there are lots of awful people in the world, and its not your fault you ended up with a bad father, lucky for you, you have a Father who will always love you and treat you right, God.  And you have already found him, so welcome to the family.|`|yqUgRG2raa	Think, would your father forgive someone that did the same thing, I bet not. You do not want to be like him, so forgive. By forgiving, you give away the bad feeling. You do need to stay away and just send him nice letters. I have a sister who has made life horrible for family members but my aunt cut her out of the will. lol Karma.|`|NSbU041Caa	you should forgive and respect your father, but I understand that that is a very tough thing to do. Just keep Jesus and God in mind at all times, and thank Him and praise Him for His loving grace and kindness.  and yeah, if you are still living with him, it would be wise to leave if he is being too abusive, but I have not much insight into your life so I don't know.|`|oMMnfGXIaa	Romans 12:18 (New Living Translation)  18 Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.

If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back. 16 But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses. 17 If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she wont accept the churchs decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector.   18 I tell you the truth, whatever you forbid[f] on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit[g] on earth will be permitted in heaven.     19 I also tell you this: If two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you. 20 For where two or three gather together as my followers,[h] I am there among them.        i know its a long passage to read but if your really looking for  help then you'll look into it  http://www.graceonlinelibrary.org/articl...|`|2MP9nYLdaa	If you are gay repent to God through Jesus and you will be forgiven but you must be willing to turn from that sin. God loves you very much. Jesus said to forgive those that persecute you so that your Father in Heaven can forgive you. Yes forgive but do not put up with it. Tell somebody, pray to Jesus and ask Jesus to help you and to help your dad too. Please repent from your sin of being gay because Jesus said :Not everyone who calls me Lord Lord will enter the Kingdom of God but he who does the will of My Father who is in Heaven" When you repent from your heart you will be forgiven. Your life style is not worth going to hell for. Jesus is the answer and he loves you but not your gay life style.|`|mLYFbStGaa	I forgave my mother for telling me some horrible things.  She is not a Christian, either.  Believe me, I had thoughts of never speaking to her again a few times.    It's been a struggle, but God does command us to honor our parents.  And, of course, as others have pointed out, forgive others so that we may be forgiven.      Parents aren't perfect, but the commandment to honor them doesn't have clauses on it.  So, at least for me, I still have to honor my parents, even when my mother laughs at my beliefs, puts me down for them, or says inflammatory things.      I believe that through that kind of submission, someday she may be saved, because my words have no effect, anyway.   It's not easy, though.    Perhaps if you "turn the other cheek", he will see that his remarks do not have any effect on you, and that you are actually being more of a Christian than he, by example.  You will also be obeying God by honoring your father, and God always blesses obedience.|`|0VBESmFQaa	Jesus likes those who stand up for themselves,You are a person and you should not go through this, The best revenge is to make something great of yourself and totally make him look like the nothing he really is|`|JaOddaodaa	well...............  ur papa is angry with u,   ur papa thinks u r looser........    y not prove him wrong..........  y dnt u do something to prove him wrong.    ur papa is angry with u, but not frustrated with u, may be his b.p. is a bit high.......... forgive him..................u concentrate in proving urslf..........and he will be mum.  believ me.........my papa is still so loud........but i know he loves me.|`|4T9fZzITaa	omgosh how irritating.. scandelous. well we both know your not doing the same mistake with your kids. in time you should (not have to course) forgive him and before you do let him know what he does to you. that's just messed up. and if you forgive him you should really mean it and not just cause you feel its the right thing..if your guna do it really mean it if you decide to do it. tune him out. you know that whatever he's saying isnt right and move on .. maybe you'll have those memories but dont let it affect you anymore.|`|FhHklqkhaa	you should leave  he is abusing you  you could forgive him in the future maybe? do not let him mess you up.

When I was growing up, it was common wisdom that if a woman wasn't married by 30, she probably never would be. Great. When I realize my grandmother was married at 18, sometimes I wish we could go back to those simpler times.  Then I think of all the different life experiences I've had having so much independence. At any rate I prefer my life to having married young and dedicating my life to another person but then ending up divorced anyway.

These rituals have also been around since the beginning of time, as it is documented fact that man has ALWAYS cared for their dead, in some respectable fashion.  And though you may find embalming "disgusting", then the next time I spend 16 hours embalming and restoring a 16 year old after a car accident so that his mother can see him and say goodbye to him, I'll be sure to let her know how "disgusting" it was of me to spend those countless hours working on her son so he looked like himself instead of a bloody, broken mess.  You need  a good dose of maturity and then a splash of reality, because your niave thoughts won't get you too far.

This new generation of young adults are going to rise above all other generations because they are up against extreme odds.  My generation and above are going to have to start supporting these younger generations.  Encouragement, praise, support, lots of hugs, believing in them and lifting them up to achieve their pursuits.  It is all for humanity in the end.    Stop putting these young ones down and start being their friend.    Chaos, I want people to know this.  It drives me crazy when I hear someone say, "these kids nowadays are playing these video games, taking drugs and are so lazy".  I say, "Were you young once? I believe in these younger generations.  If anything, we need to ask for their forgiveness and give them all the positive support we can".    Peace.

DO7lDtqxaa	I see arranged as your parents hook you up.You have time to get to know each other.Love for the sake of Allah is best love of all.Sometimes you think you are in love but it's not the kind of love that makes a marriage last. example.. you love his smile but,will you love him if his teeth fall out? You can know someone for your whole life and still not know them.Marriage is more than just two people. It is the joining of two people who make a life together.Involves respect first, compatibility, similar basic moral beliefs, friendship, safety in security of marriage.From all these things love grows.   As a woman you can meet a man anywhere fall in love, get married, have kids, he looses his job, gets on drugs then beats you daily. Marry a man whom you haven't known for long and he take you home and beats you the first night. You never really know either way.At least you are married and right with Allah.If he comes to you for marriage means he respects Allah first. I think your chances of a better husband is one who ask with Allah in his heart first.  If he is a good muslim and a real man he would never do such a thing as to hurt you because he fears Allah.|`|AA11379158	i used to have the same apprehensions you do. eventually i married my cousin (no, it was not arranged. my mom wanted it and i saw no serious reason to say no.) and not for a moment do i regret it. of course, there are good and bad days, as in any marriage. but after all's said and done, i do not regret it and i'd do it again if i had the choice. there are no guarantees, you know. i mean, nothing can assure you that this guy IS the one for you, that he'll make you happy, that he'll respect you etc. in life, there are no guarantees and even if we did date (which, thank God we don't) but even if we did, you'll find that you can never know a person one hundred per cent. everything in life changes, and a human being changes the most. ya never know, girl. so, in that case, what do we do? well, a non muslim could say to you, follow your heart. problem is, your heart could fool you, and can be used by shaitaan to lead you to a disaster. as a muslima, all i can say to you is, pray istikharah. seriously, that's all there is to it. only Allah guides, only Allah truly knows the heart of a person (coz hey, it belongs to Him and He alone controls us all). so ask Allah, then use your best judgment. in the past i really was against marriage and i was always scared of what might happen to me if i do fall for it, but now alhamdulillah i'm happily married, we have a son, and i pray to Allah to guide me and to control both of us so we'll always b good for each other inshallah. salaam alaikum sister|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam.

It was related by Muslim (also by at-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah).    The Prophet (peace be upon him) also reportedly said, "Whenever a man is alone with a woman, Satan (Shaytan) is the third among them" (Tirmidhi).  When young people are getting to know each other, being alone together is a temptation toward wrongdoing.     Hadrat Umar (RA) related that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Not one of you should meet a woman alone unless she is accompanied by a relative (mahram)" (Bukhari/Muslim).     so it is not permissible to be with a man unless you are married.    a women must struggle to find herself a man.    you still talk to him before, you make a meeting arrangement with a mahram, him and you. so you know if he's right for you, follows his deen correctly e.t.c.|`|74fe5c642d059f46a34e9d235a375172aa	I didn't date, but I found my husband by my self.

If you find you dont get along, then cancel the engagement and no ones chastity was broken.. But in the other side, what if you fall in love deeper.. thats the icing on the cake..|`|5iXcXlMeaa	hiyaa,    Lets forget Islam for a sec and use our logic. As a start I am against arranged marriages. I am the one that is going to get married and I have the right to choose the person who I think will make the best husband. If one day my mom was to tell me to marry someone I will say 'NO' straight away. She isn't going to get married on my behalf is she???    As for dating I am against this too. When you date someone you are more likely to get involved in a harm act no matter how little it may seem I just think it is wrong going out with a guy that you don't really know or isn't related to you in any sort of way.    To get back to what you just said:    'i mean that its a man that ppl arround u choose that they feel he's a good muslim but arent u affraid from the idea that 'U DONT REALLY KNOW HIM' (he's personality, qualities, bad habits etc...). So how exactly will dating help you?? Aren't you afraid to go out with him since you don't know him properly? It is exactly the same. If you were to date someone then for how long will you be willing to do this? Maybe a few months or maybe a year or 2 he can pretend to be a nice, sweet gentle man when he isn't. Trust me it isn't very hard. Then he will reveal his evil side. Lol I mean it is possible. lesh la2??    I don't know about you but I am the sort of person that gets bored very easily. So if I was to date someone I will only last for a few weeks then I would really want a change so dating isn't the best solution after all. If I was to date a guy I will know for sure that I don't want to marry him because if I am allowed to go out with him why would I marry him. If you are allowed to do many things before marriage then what is the whole point if having a marriage contract??? When you date someone you are just selling yourself for cheap and definitely wasting your time and this is my opinion before even knowing that it is Haram in Islam.     I don't know what sort of a guy would like his 'future wife; to go out with I don't know how many non-mahrams just to see who is the best or whose personality she likes the most. Yes he would be a husband that definitely knows how much his wife means to him and that is IF she means anything to him in the first place. Not to mention that dating is HARAM. I know how many people try to find excuses that dating isnt haram and you need to know the guy but it is and I say alhamduliallah it is. You can speak on the phone or meet in university or work or I dont know where but lets not get carried away and always know your limits.    I totally understand where you are coming from and I am more than 100% sure that no girl would want to marry a guy that she doesnt know but dating isnt the right solution. You can meet but in public places or when one member of your family is around or lets say chat on the phone or send messages and texts. You will feel that you love him and that he is the right one for you but you still think that there is a red line that cannot be crossed and you will want to get married as soon as possible to break there barriers between you. You just want to spend the rest of your life with this one person.  All I know is that a successful marriage doesn't need an arranged marriage (but it does need your parents approval) nor does it need dating. All it needs is love. When this essential factor is there nothing else truly matters. ba3den el jawez 2isme w naseeb.    Inshallah koon se3adtek  Wish you all the best!

Arranged Marriages have been around for ages, and have had no real problems. Love is not a true emotion, no matter what the poets and hippies say. True emotions cannot be helped or controlled. I am not Muslim, or a Christian. Just an intellectual atheist that thinks I can help you in that aspect. Love is a fake emotion that is intertwined with lust. What I am trying to say is, I am sure there are arranged marriages where the spouses are unhappy... but not often. You will be assigned someone that your father feels is best for you. From there, it is your choice to fall in love or not.|`|60df5ff8f8ccc7873e68c2407a7ca9f6aa	i had a similar question    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    in my opinion arranged marriage is the best but you should work hard in engagement period to discover your future husband|`|ue1WpA39aa	Before buying meat you need to check it and see if its fresh right.

But, as a Muslim I'd like him to obey all the Islamic teachings. Maybe, setting some qualities could help you.    2) Are you with the arranged marriage   Yes, I am. It's just one of many ways to meet man but it is the safest. Our parents only have the rights recommend someone to us and in the end, we have the last say. But, the father (or wali) can marry their daughter to someone if he is sure that a man is suitable for her.    The parents' blessings are always important.    3) Aren't you afraid this man ( arranged) will hurt you   Islam has a simple principle; Lailahaillallah. Humans must obey the elaborate rules because they are the best way to lead a life. It can create a utopia.   In marriage, a man is supposed to see his future's wife's face and have a conversation. Rasulullah (pbuh) allows a meet between the two so that the huaband will have an anticipation factor for the marriage. It is definitely important that both person want the marriage to happen.    To make a decision this big is hard. You can do a Solah sunat, Istikhoroh. A clear mind and letting Allah decide for you is the best. It can prevent from self-blaming whenever something bad happens.     Best of luck!

aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	It's easier for me to tell you what has to be done for me.    My husband is very self disciplined.     Sunday - washes the sheets and shops.  Monday - cleans the bathroom.  Tuesday- Vacuums through the house.  Wednesday - he does my washing.  Thursday - his washing.  Friday - his free day  Saturday - his free day.    My kids do all the deep cleaning and maintenance, also painting.    My grandsons are just the size that they take their turn as the get big enough to do the weekly yard work. We have always paid these boys for their work.  It's good for them to learn how to work and do a very good job.  They have to do the way I did it when I could.    We are down to our last two grandsons - the one doing it now is in 9th grade - when he graduates or find another job - we have the youngest of them that will then take over.    We have a great family that sees to it that all is well all the time.    I can do this - read - do most of my personal care with the help of my husband.    We both nap and he does his work on his computer the rest of the time.    About 7 P.M. we have our coffee - watch TV or converse.    He goes to bed at 11 P.M. sharp - he wakes up before 6 A.M. - eats, showers and walks (Doctors orders since his heart attack) for 1/2 hour - then his daily routine begins.    I think I have told you more than you really wanted to know and got off track some.    This is a good question - it has made me think about how good I have it and I need to be more thankful for all the deeds that are done for me.

AA10098101	Anyone who claims they are an expert on God is full of bull.  The smartest people to ever live were wrong A LOT, as am I, as are you.  Hate and pride do not come from knowing God, but from knowing life (you can thank Adam and Eve for that one).    Religion tends to lead to stupidity.  Religion is comprised of people, and people are, in general, stupid.  However true relationship with God via salvation through Jesus is the key to joy, happiness, and fulfillment in life.

In past times a large woman was the one sought out. A large woman showed wealth and health. I mean come on!!!! Isn't life hard enough for women in America. We work full time jobs cook, clean, raise the kids.Why do we have to be mocked for being heavy?   We are being force to think we are not good enough. By being looked down on. Shunned by society. Laughed at and criticized.A woman is better off a leaper than heavy.It is causing our daughters to starve themselves.Millions of dollars for medical care for eating disorders. Millions of dollars spent on unsafe cosmetic surgery and gastric bypass. All because media says we are supposed to be this or supposed to be that.

kVTryKlBaa	In fact I do, now almost thirty years later.  It ended up being my best friend.   He was straight.  VERY straight and very 'active' all the time.  Sometimes with as many as two or three women a night.  He had no clue about me, I never had a problem with him being with 'others' as long as I was with him, partying and so on.  But when he would be out with whoever and I was stuck somewhere else, it would eat me alive, I hated it, I really hated her. She could be with him and enjoy all his attention and his drop dead body, just because she was a female.  She, whoever she was for the night, had no feelings, no concerns no love for him, but he gave himself to her gladly,  And I just hated that.  Here I was, in love,  real love,  I would have done anything, given everything to have the pleasure of him, but I was a guy, it was out of the question.    then I went too far.   When he learned the truth, that was it,  We stayed friends, but it was never the same.   He just could not accept what I felt.  I wanted to blame him, but how can you?  How can you blame someone for being 'normal?'    He died very unexpectedly two years ago, at a young age of a annurisim.    I had not had much chance to talk to him in a long time.      There is a song by Pink, called "Who Knew"    there are so many lines that describe my life in that song.    I hope yours has a much happier ending.
FH0oIzjwaa	They are real and fighting one is a major pain.  They are kind of like dogs where they stake out a "territory" and usually hang around there.  Most people are unable to see them because of their blind faith.  Its strange that you can have someone preach to you that you just have to have faith in something that they cant see but they just cant understand when a demon is influencing them.  You ever notice how sometimes someones life is great and just falls down the drain really fast?  That is sometimes the influence of a demon.  Maybe they came into their territory and it took offense.  Maybe it just decided that they were the flavor of the month (I do mean that literally), its kinda hard to tell what motivates them.  But they feed off negative emotions.  Keep it in mind.|`|e3gZsCsgaa	Seriously, they are what you want them to be.

AA11922696	Theres  no comparison at all between a women , dogg or donkeys. Some muslims thougt that only women and dogss cutt of the prayer, they failed to know the true words mentioned by the prophet regarding the things who cut off someones prayer. Thats why aicha responded to them.    The prophet also had no problem at all with his wife being close to him while praying:     Volume 1, Book 9, Number 493:                                                                             Narrated 'Aisha: The things which annual prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, a donkey and a woman. I said, "You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs. By Allah! I saw the Prophet praying while I used to lie in (my) bed between him and the Qibla. Whenever I was in need of something, I disliked to sit and trouble the Prophet. So, I would slip away by the side of his feet."   Volume 1, Book 9, Number 491:                                                                                Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet used to pray while I was sleeping across in his bed in front of him.

Quite often a girl or guy will go out with a guy like this to get the same relationship they had with their parent.

f0850578f9cb1b6e79940540e6c2eacfaa	We all create the person we are with to some extent.  Some pretty girls, bring out the worst in men.  These men are reflecting the person they see in the mirror.      Think of two people like the opposite sides of a butterfly.  One is good, and nice, the other is bad and nasty.  A person who is very good, makes the person they are with look very nasty, if they are not that person.    If they are that person, they are one.  She just has not yet found the person who becomes her, rather than a reflection of her.    A pretty girl brings out many strong and powerful emotions in men like envy, jealousy, lust and greed. A pretty girl needs to be with a man who is equal in order to ensure that he would not be humiliated by her in presence of other men.    Put simply, she has not yet met her match.  One day she will, and she will look nasty and will be the one people will say behaved badly.    Remember, when observing a relationship from the outside, you only see what is shown.  You do not see what occurs when you are not observing.  The only true witness to who is right and who is wrong, are the parties involved.    She says this, have you heard his side?|`|sP8KrvA7aa	Because good girls tend to let men treat them this way.

This communication demonstrates a willingness to accept, without skepticism, the influence of the speaker in a way similar to a child's acceptance of the influence of a parent.

uvx3cnkJaa	I personally believe women of other religions lack a soul not Muslim women but that's only my opinion. asking this question shows how very uneducated you are about Islam and the life of Muslim women.     Don't get me started on the drivers, maids. high dowry, big houses, very diverse emplyoment/education opportunity..etc  Muslim women enjoy in the Gulf countries. I mean in England, the government pays my full tuition fees while British girls have to work part-time jobs to pay for their education.     No alcohol makes us sober all the time and aware of what's going on around us not like Western women who end every week in hospitals after passing out in public and waking up with heavy hangovers. Now who has a soul and who doesn't?    Our boys and girls can only enjoy each other after they get married. No need to worry about sexually transmitted diseases or unwanted pregnancy as the relationship is 'legalized' and usually the Muslim family is healthy due to zero alcohol conception and no adultery. Now who has a soul and who doesn't?    The wife doesn't have to watch over her husband and live in fear of him cheating on her as women cover themselves in front of men out of the family and chances of affairs are very slim.Therefore, you see that the men appreciate their women 'because that's all they can see' and can't compare them to other women. Now who has a soul and who doesn't?    I can go on and on but all I can say is I usually don't waste my time answering questions like this as I'm aware of the fact that we come from very different backgrounds and it's hard for you to understand our lifestyle but again someone has to say something. I mean really thinking that because Muslim women cover they don't have a soul is merely 'insane'. What about women who don't cover and their husbands are with a different women everyday? what about another husband who strips his wife of all her rights and hits her but she can't tell anyone, what do you call a women lika that in a 'Western' society?     Does she have a soul? I guess not..|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Since the Islamic faith teaches nothing of the kind they would probably feel that you are a fool for asking such a question.|`|AA12346187	Mohamed may have said that  I do not believe  islam does  he was a man  who made   it suit  his   thoughts.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, that is fair enough, since women are all sinful daughters of the she-demon Lilith and must be controlled by men, the holy sons of God-favoured Adam.

0FXVTZf7aa	First of all premarital sex is not actually a sin in the Bible.  It's just run away academic theories that make it appear to be a sin.    The situation described would be rape, and while she may have been very stupid and arguably sinned by getting THAT drunk I don't think the problem here is premarital sex.  It's drunkenness, stupidity and rape.|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	Of course.   It's not really a grey area actually.  It's pretty black and white.    She also got drunk, and that's a sin too.    It all happened because she was not wearing the full armor of God.  We are called to guard our hearts and to project our salvation.  Not that this event would cost the girl her salvation.  But do you think that God would be actually watching this event happen?  Absolutely not.  He would HAVE to turn his eyes away.  That is the definition of Sin.  If God can watch the act, then it is not sinful.  But if he must turn away, then it is a sin.  Sin is turning away from God.  This is why sex within the confines of marriage is good.  God is pleased that people are enjoying the great gift that he bestowed upon them.  But using it outside of His intended purpose (to become one physically, spiritually, and emotionally with the person you share your life with) then he must turn away.    EDIT:  Are you serious?  Can you not see this yourself? Drinking wine doesn't make you drunk.  Drinking wine EXCESSIVELY makes you drunk.  Drinking wine is not a sin.  Drinking TOO MUCH wine is a sin.  It's not hard AT ALL to find it in the Bible.    Romans 13:13 Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.    Galatians 5:  19The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.    EDIT 2:  WOW!  Seriously?  4 thumbs down?  Why?  Are you all children?  It wasn't the drunk thing, was it?  It MUST have been that you all WANT to be ALLOWED to have pre-marital sex and you didn't like my PROOF that it is a sin.  Sure, shoot the messenger.|`|AA11595906	Sounds like the guy's pretty damn lucky she enjoyed it.|`|b2bMy1EAaa	SmartAlex if being drunk is a sin then why the hell did Jesus turn water into wine and why is wine given at churches? Should he not just turned it into grape juice or something?|`|NSbU041Caa	she willingly allowed it to happen, even though she could have stopped it. It is premarital sex from her perspective.|`|oGRsxfBiaa	I think allowing for it to happen is sort of consenting anyway, it's not like you need to make a written or oral consent every time you are about to have sex, so her not refusing is still consenting, so yeah it is bad :/ And why drink so much that you pass out and can't remember things? (that's against the Bible as well btw :P).|`|RNmCUNOvaa	Who gives a rats A what the Bible says... You know it your heart it is wrong becaue the holy ghost says its wrong... Yes getting drunk is wrong, having premarital sex is wrong.  That is why Christ paid the price for you sins.  Go your way and sin no more.|`|Dd0muPF6aa	The Bible does not shy from recounting some cases of rape and attempted rape that occurred in the past. (Genesis 19:4-11; 34:1-7; 2?Samuel 13:1-14) But it also offers counsel on what one should do when threatened with rape.    This Bible counsel sheds light on the correct view on hypothetical cases like the one you presented above    What the Law says on the matter is found at Deuteronomy 22:23-27. This covers two situations. In the first case, a man found a young woman in a city and lay down with her. Even so, the woman did not scream or cry for help. Consequently, it was determined that she was guilty for the reason that she did not scream in the city. If she had cried out, people nearby might have been able to come to her rescue.     In the second instance, a man found a young woman in the countryside, where he grabbed hold of her and lay down with her. In defense, the woman screamed, but there was no one to rescue her. Unlike the woman in the first instance, this woman clearly did not give in to the actions of the attacker. She actively resisted him, crying for help, but she was overpowered. Her screaming proved that she was an unwilling victim; she was not guilty of wrongdoing.    Although Christians today are not under the Mosaic Law, the principles mentioned therein provide them with guidance. The above account underscores the importance of resisting and screaming for help. Screaming when threatened with rape is still viewed as a practical course.     One expert on crime prevention stated: If a woman is attacked, her best weapon is still her lungs. A womans screaming may attract others, who can then assist her, or it may startle an attacker and make him leave. A young Christian woman who was attacked by a rapist stated: I screamed with all my might, and he backed off. When he came toward me again, I screamed and ran. In the past I had often thought, How can screaming help me when some big man grabs me with only one thing on his mind? But Ive learned that it works!    Even in the sad case where a woman is overpowered and raped, her struggle and screaming for help is not in vain. On the contrary, it establishes that she did all she possibly could to resist her attacker. (Deuteronomy 22:26) Despite going through this ordeal, she can still have an undefiled conscience, self-respect, and the assurance that she is clean in Gods eyes. The horrifying experience might leave her with emotional wounds, but knowing that she did all she could to resist the attack will greatly contribute to her gradual healing.    In understanding the application of Deuteronomy 22:23-27, we must realize that this brief account does not cover all possible situations. For example, it does not comment on the situation where the attacked woman cannot scream because she is mute, unconscious, or paralyzed with fear or is forcibly prevented from screaming by a hand or tape over her mouth.     However, since Jehovah is able to weigh all factors, including motives, he deals with understanding and justice in such cases, for all his ways are justice. (Deuteronomy 32:4) He is aware of what actually took place and of the efforts the victim put forth to fight off her attacker. Therefore, a victim who was unable to scream but otherwise did all she could under the circumstances can leave matters in Jehovahs hands.Psalm 55:22; 1?Peter 5:7.    Even so, some Christian women who have been attacked and violated are incessantly pained by feelings of guilt. In hindsight, they feel that they should have done more to prevent the incident from happening. However, instead of blaming themselves, such victims can pray to Jehovah, ask for his help, and have confidence in his abundant loving-kindness.Exodus 34:6; Psalm 86:5.    Hence, Christian women who are presently coping with emotional wounds resulting from an encounter with a rapist can be confident that Jehovah fully understands the painful feelings they are dealing with. Gods Word assures them: Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves. (Psalm 34:18)     Further help to cope with their trauma can come from accepting the sincere understanding and gentle support of fellow believers in the Christian congregation. (Job 29:12; 1?Thessalonians 5:14) Moreover, the victims own efforts to concentrate on positive thoughts will help them to experience the peace of God that excels all thought.Philippians 4:6-9.
Y95mhtUnaa	What's wrong with saying black? If you're using it in a sentence, it's ok just don't make it deragatory or negative. If you used it negatively, then that would be racist.

AA11102769	Some Pagan religions believe that.|`|AA10331582	It can be said that every religion must acknowledge the principles listed below. I hope they serve to answer your question.    IV. THE PRINCIPLE OF POLARITY.  Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same;  opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all  paradoxes may be reconciled.The Kybalion.    VII. THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER.  Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.  The Kybalion.    VII. THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER.  This Principle embodies the truth that there is GENDER manifested in everythingthe Masculine and Feminine Principles ever at work. This is true not only of the Physical Plane, but of the Mental and even the Spiritual Planes.   On the Physical Plane, the Principle manifests as SEX, on the higher planes it takes higher forms, but the Principle is ever the  same. No creation, physical, mental or spiritual, is possible without this Principle.     An understanding of its laws will throw light on many a subject that has perplexed the minds of men. The Principle of Gender works ever in the direction of generation, regeneration, and  creation. Everything, and every person, contains the two Elements or Principles, or this great Principle, within it, him or her.   Every Male thing has the Female Element also; every Female  contains also the Male Principle.     If you want to understand the philosophy of Mental and Spiritual Creation, Generation, and Re-generation, you must understand and study this Hermetic Principle. It contains the solution of many mysteries of Life. We caution you that this Principle has no reference to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful theories, teachings and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a prostitution of the great natural principle of Gender. Such base revivals of the ancient infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind, body and soul, and the Hermetic Philosophy has ever sounded the warning note against these degraded teachings which tend toward lust, licentiousness,  and perversion of Nature's principles. if you seek such teachings, you must go elsewhere for themHermeticism contains nothing for you along these lines.     To the pure, all things are pure; to the base, all things are base.  Peace.|`|AA10553752	Probably, But not the true one!      loj

He would be grounded for a good 3 months if not more.      He would also be made to do household chores, and be paid money for them so that he can use that money to buy his sister new CD's, music books, and new piano (or pay his parents back when they get that stuff).    He would also do "home assignments"...like writing lines...or a project on how to get along with siblings...or the consequences of aggressiveness and bad behavior.    I would have quite a few discussions with him about aggression, jealousy towards his sister, his angry feelings, the terrible inappropriateness of his actions.  He would *know* after all this, how much trouble he was in.    And if he *ever* did another thing similar to this, his butt would be in therapy quicker than you could blink.|`|4esOOErCaa	ground the hell out of him    pricks like that need to learn what they did was wrong.. i'd take away what meant most to him (because he destroyed the one thing that means most to his sister) for a couple of months at least  if he liked socialising/going out with friends- that would be stopped  video games/computer- stopped    he could also help pay for a new piano for his sister|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	He needs to be sent to a children's home for mentally disturbed kids.

I would sit down with my son and explain what he did and how that hurt his sister and then I would take away his most prized possession.  I would also make him work to help pay for the replacement of part of his sisters destroyed items.  I would also talk to the parents of the other kids involved and let them know what their child did.  It is important that the punishment goes to the right children.|`|K2nbcyKSaa	Maybe this is a  warning that Josh needs more supervision. All of the kids that did this should have their parents notified and be talked to. This is terrible that people especially children can act like monsters in a group. The little girl is weak and vulnerable and the kids did just the worst thing possible to her. I think the kids need a spanking and the parents need to get complete authority over the kids and make them posibly learn a prayer to combat these cruel tendencies. Maybe they could learn a Psalm like the Lord is my shepherd after they are spanked. My mom hit me with a 2X4 once. It is something to give a child like Josh a spanking that is not illegal and maybe one that he won't forget for a long while.|`|db9f4e17f5a919d6fbcc6f293a58f828aa	I would ground him and take his allowance pay to replace all her broken things.

He knows about them as can be heard in his songs, Tabloid Junkie, Money, DS, Is It Scary, Scream, and Leave Me Alone, Most written almost 10 or more years ago. Putting out bad news for him has become big business that you see in tabloids and many just loove to eat up what tabloids write. Maybe its because they know even if he is on a low key, he has loyal fans who won't budge and continue to love him well so that is why it has become a "normal" thing to hate him even without meeting him.|`|HXpOui7gaa	Because they're ignorant losers that have nothing better to do than make someones life hell.

AA11152153	The split that came about in the church during the reformation divided the church into Catholic and Protestant.    Many of the leaders of the Protestants believed that the Catholic Church was the antichrist, the man of sin, the whore of Babylon.     As such, they did not consider Catholicism to be Christian because Catholicism was married to Paganism.     Many Protestants today continue to make this distinction. Where they err is in assuming that all Catholics are not Christian. In fact, there are many Catholics who are true Christians and who are practicing their Christianity to the best they know how.     Catholicism today, as a religion is no more in union with the doctrines of Christ as it was in the middle ages when it (the Roman Catholic Church) slaughtered the saints of the Most High during the dark ages.    There can be no union between Christ and antichrist.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Any person who believes Jesus is God, believes in the Bible and follows Jesus teachings, is a Christian.    Jesus only said " Follow Me" He did not say I want you to become a Catholic or Protestant or Methodist or Baptist etc.    These are all man made denominations. Our main focus should be on Jesus.    Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

I also am Christian but I am not Catholic or Protestant.     I am not Catholic because I keep all the commandments including the second commandment which forbids making idols and serving and bowing before idols.  I am not Protestant because I keep the fourth commandment, which is the test commandment.      There are people all through the history of the past 1900 years who never embraced a religion that was mixed with Paganism.  If you look in the book of Acts you will see what these people are like.|`|6bKws0fAaa	If you have Christ in your heart then denomination means nothing. Yet catholics have a strictly different set of beliefs and practices than protestants. while the bible says do not worship any idol or god before me, they pray to statues of saints and pray to the virgin mary to mediate between them and God. [makes no sense right?] protestants pray to God directly and we only worship Him, we worship no image. Catholicism emerged from the merging of Christianity with the European forms of paganism. While protastantism emerged from Martin Luther who based everything on the Bible. Now being a Christian does not only mean you believe Jesus is the son of God. Many do believe that and jesus even said that "On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name? 23 And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness."

It's really all in how they express their religion.     Catholics are Christians, but usually not to the fullest extent.  Plus a lot of Christians don't want to be related to the Catholic church because of certain events that they headed up (falsely) in the name of God (the crusades, the inquisition; stuff like that)    For the same reason I'm not too fond of the term "Christian" anymore.  I prefer to just be a follower of Jesus.|`|qcEzJDY6aa	If you're an atheist you don't believed in God, so why would you have trouble in minding to know the thinking of these people who believed in God? Yes there are private Christians, you said you were reading books, Christ said to his disciples "anyone who is not against us is with us." you can search the book again. There are Christians living the rules of Christ, so they too can be called Christians even tho they have no denominations like me. I am following the teachings of Christ but I don't go with any religious churches, so what's wrong is there a word in the bible that tells those who were in church only shall be saved or be called Christians?|`|0HLOLwXKaa	Catholicism is sort of a form of Christianity I guess you can say it's a "denomination" Catholics have some weird believes (some of which are against the bible, like praying to "saints") When someone says that they are Christian not Catholic it means just that.....what's not to understand?

Where is the pope delcared the leader of Gods church in scripture?  The Catholics whorship Mary who is a cover for the Goddess ices.  The Catholic Church is called the whore of Babylon and is the mother to the systems that whorship of Antichrist. The Catholic Church is paganism mixed with the bible.      The Catholic Church will be destroyed by the beast of Revalation because it stands in his way for the top dog.      Gods real church are the Saints that are willing to stand for the truth. They do not see a building as there Church but the bodys they live in are Temples of Holy Spirit of God. Therefore whever you are, Gods Church is.

bxYWJAYNaa	It would be a really horrible domino effect!    Firstly businesses would collapse, people would lose their jobs and then have no income.  The farming sector would also collapse and farms would foreclose. Food production and distribution would grind to a halt.    So you would end up with a mob of people, with no money, and a massive food shortage. There would be riots, and the country would descend into anarchy as people desperately tried to feed themselves and fend of starvation. Millions would die, and the cities would be abandoned, as people returned to the countryside in search of food.    In other words, it would look something like Somalia today.|`|eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	If American cant even rescue themselves so how can support the rest of the world, and so socialists shall march every where without a blood drop.

AA10637643	What is the restoration?  The restoration is literally the restoring of the FULL gospel to the earth.  We believe that after Christ's apostles died, there was a great apostasy, or falling away, of people from the gospel, and that the Priesthood was not passed on to anyone else, so it was lost from the earth.  There were still bits and pieces of the gospel, but not the fullness.  Doctrines were lost, left out, or meanings were changed.  That is why there was a need - because the fullness was lost, because the gospel was not complete.  We believe that the restoration came when there was one on the earth who the Lord knew, and we believe had chosen in the premortal world, could lead and guide His church and restore the gospel to it's fulness.  We believe God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ came to Joseph Smith as he prayed... and they instructed him in many things, one was that he would restore the gospel and organize Christ's true church upon the earth.    How can you truly know?  By studying, reading the Book of Mormon and by praying to your Heavenly Father to know.  Through the power of the Holy Ghost, you can know the truth of all things, that is a promise given by our Heavenly Father.  That is what I have done.  I have received my own personal witness, from the Holy Ghost, that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints truly IS Christ's church, that Joseph Smith IS a prophet, that he really translated the golden plates into the Book of Mormon, that the Priesthood was restored and that the fullness of the gospel is on the earth and will never be taken away again.  I know my family and marriage can be eternal.  I know following the commandments and keeping the covenants I have made will lead me one step closer to exaltaion.  I know because I have asked.  You can have the same knowledge.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Christ organized his church when he lived upon the earth.   He called apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists (missionaries) and others.   References to this church organization is found here in the Bible:    Ephesians 2:19-20  19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;     20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;   Ephesians 4:11-16  11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, epastors and fteachers;     12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:     13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:     14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;     15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:     16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.     Christ's church had proper authority to preach.  See Luke 9:1-2    1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.     2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.   John 15:16    16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.     Christ also predicted that his true church would be taken from the earth through apostasy.      Apostasy of the early Christian church:   This people draw near me with their mouth, Isaiah 29: 10, 13. Darkness shall cover the earth, Isaiah 60: 2.   The Lord will send a famine of hearing the words of the Lord, Amos 8: 11.   There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, Matthew 24: 24. Grievous wolves shall enter in among you, Acts 20: 29.   I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him, Gallations 1: 6.   There will be a falling away before the Second Coming, 2 Thessalonians 2: 3.   Some people err concerning the truth, 2 Timothy 2: 18.   Some people have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof, 2 Timothy 3: 5.   The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, 2 Timothy 4: 3-4.   There will be false prophets and false teachers among the people, 2 Peter 2: 1.   Certain men crept in denying the only Lord God, Jude 1: 4.   Some men said they were Apostles and were not, Revelations 2: 2.        This "falling away" has occurred as predicted and prophesied.  And, as Christ said, a "restoration of all things" has occurred to restore the true church.    Christ has said that the truth would be restored to the earth.   The Lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains, Isaiah 2: 2 (Micah 4: 2).   God will do a marvellous work and a wonder, Isaiah 29: 14.   God shall set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, Daniel 2: 44.   Elias will come, and restore all things, Matt. 17: 11 (Mark 9: 12). There will come times of restitution of all things, Acts 3: 21.   In the dispensation of the fulness of times, God will gather together in one all things, Ephesians 1: 10.   I saw another angel, having the everlasting gospel to preach, Revelations 14: 6.       All of these things are in the Bible.  All of these things are by the grace and love of God, and through that love, we have the gospel in its fulness upon the earth again.      That is what the LDS Chruch teaches:  things that are in the Bible.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	In 2 Thessalonians in the New Testament, Paul tells the people that before Christ returns, there will first be a "falling away".  In the original Greek, the word used was apostasia, which literally means "apostasy", or "defection".    And in Acts 3:20-21, it says that Christ will remain in heaven until the "restoration of all things".    In other words, the Bible itself says that there will be a falling away, and then a restoration before Christ returns.  In other words, certain truths and authority were lost some time after the deaths of Christ's apostles; those truths needed to be restored.  And those truths HAVE been restored. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is Christ's church RESTORED to the earth.     As far as what Mormons believe in, the following website will give you the basics.  https://www.mormon.org    As far as how you can know if what we tell you is the truth...one of the great things about Mormon doctrine is that we don't ask people to just take our word for it.  We believe that God answers prayers.  Study our doctrines and pray about them.  God speaks to to man through the peace of the Holy Ghost.    As far as where you're going?  Well that depends. Jesus said, "In my Father's house are many mansions."  We believe pretty much everyone is going to heaven, and will receive some kind of reward according to their works.  This does not take away from Christ's sacrifice, which we believe to be absolutely essential. Staying with the mansion metaphor, Christ's sacrifice is what allows us to get any kind of "mansion", but it's our works that determine how big it will be.  So where are you going?  To heaven, thanks to Christ.  Where in heaven are you going?  That's up to you.    Feel free to email me with any other questions.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	You have already been given many good answers.  I probably won't augment what they have already told you.  In the New Testament, the apostles prophesied that Christ would not come again until after there was first a falling away.  They also prophesied that there would be a restoration of all things.  In the first century after Christ, all the apostles were killed without them being able to call replacements.  As a result, the apostolic authority was lost from the earth bringing what justifiable became known as the dark ages.  It was an age where no gospel knowledge or spiritual enlightenment was available.  This time was prophesied in the Old Testament as a time when men would thirst for the word of God and not be able to find it.  In the spring of 1830 near Palmyra, NY, the restoration began with the appearance of the Father and the Son to young Joseph Smith, Jr.  He learned at that time that the many denominations were wrong and that the Lord had a work for him to do that would bring about the restoration of the fullness of the gospel of Christ.  Three years later, Joseph was visited by another messenger, named Moroni.  He was told about the records of an ancient people that contained a spiritual history and told of the rise and fall of his own people, who were a remnant of the House of Israel.  Four years later, September 1827, Joseph received the plates and began translating them by the gift and power of God.  The Book of Mormon was the result of that effort.  About a year later, April 6, 1830, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized according to the laws of the State of New York.  Additional revelation has been ongoing with the priesthood being restored by John the Baptist on May 15, 1829 and by Peter, James and John about a month later.  Additional keys of authority pertaining to temple rights and powers were subsequently received.  Ongoing revelation through living prophets is a foundation in the church.   I have tested and tried the gospel principles for myself and found them to be true.  The scriptures do what they say they will do.  The Holy Ghost does speak to all who ask of God in faith, humility and sincerity.  If you will ask, with a sincere heart, having faith in Christ, He will reveal the truth of the message through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.|`|WyICbuPqaa	When Jesus was on the earth, he called twelve apostles to administer his church.  When Judas committed suicide, another man was chosen to take his place.  Eventually the apostles were killed, leaving only remnants of Christ's church upon the earth.  The Melchizedek priesthood, which Christ held, and which the apostles held, was lost.  The gifts of the spirit ceased along with prophecy and revelation.  One of the remnants of the Christian church turned to voting to establish their doctrine, and backed by Rome, forced their beliefs on the other Christian sects.  Heresy was punishable by death.  That remnant became the Catholic or "universal" church.  At some point, people noticed there was a large discrepancy between the practices and tenants of the Holy scriptures and the practices and tenants of the Catholic church.  Martin Luther headed one such movement looking to reform the Catholic church, but the church was resistant to reform.  Virtually all of the modern Christian sects stem from an attempt to reform the Catholic church.      Joseph Smith was a farmboy who was brought up to believe in God.  In his early teen years he decided to attempt to figure out which church was true - which church he should join.  His investigation ended with a sincere prayer offered up in a quiet grove.  There he was visited by two heavenly beings, one of which introduced the other as his beloved son.  Joseph was stunned at first, but soon found his tongue, asking which church he should join.  He was told to join none of them, as they were all corrupt.    Years later, an angel appeared to Joseph as he was praying in his bedroom.  The angel told Joseph about a book of scripture hidden in a stone box in a hill some distance from Joseph's home.  Joseph went to the hill, and removed the stone that covered the box.  The angel appeared to him again, and gave him strict commandments concerning the contents of the box.  He could remove them only with the angel's consent, and he must never let them out of his sight, unless they were safely hidden.  He was warned to show them to no one, and that he must not be tempted by financial gain.  After four more years, Joseph was allowed to remove the Book of Mormon and the other contents of the box.  With the power of God, Joseph translated the plates into English while various scribes wrote down the translation.   When the translation was complete, God allowed three special witnesses to be called to view the plates, see the angel Moroni, and hear the voice of God testify that that translation was correct.  Their solemn testimony can be found in the preface to the Book of Mormon.  All three testified throughout their lives and on their deathbeds of the remarkable things that they both saw and heard.    Meanwhile, every strategem was used to try and steal the plates from Joseph Smith.  He was constantly harrassed by those who were obsessed with taking this treasure for themselves.  One day when Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were attempting to flee a mob, they were visited by three resurrected beings, Peter, James, and John.  The apostles laid their hands on Joseph and Oliver and ordained them to the Melchizedek priesthood.  They were instructed to call twelve men to serve as apostles, and to reorganize the Church of Christ upon the earth.  Many other angelic visitations, visions, dreams and revelations were yet to come, instructing Joseph in the organization of the church, the responsibilities of the priesthood, and the plain and precious parts of the gospel which had been lost.    Mormons say that they know the truth when they gain a spiritual conviction of the truth from God.  They ask all people to investigate the church, and the Book of Mormon, and pray sincerely to God to know the truth.  Those of us who are ardent supporters of the church have received our own heavenly witness that the Book of Mormon is true, and by extension that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.    http://www.mormon.org|`|Vk2zPoqUaa	You know that it's true if you have the faith to accept it.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Mormons basically have to believe that a guy who lived in America in the early 1800's was a prophet of the Christian god and not a liar. Thats the main tenet of the Mormon faith  believing this guy was not a liar. His name was Joe Smith and he claimed he was visited by an angel who told him the location of golden plates buried in the ground with another biblical text written in an old language on them. He claimed he translated these golden plates and wrote the translation in the Book of Mormon. He then claimed an angel took these golden plates to heaven when he finished translating them. During the translation, he claimed the golden plates were in his hat along with some magical rocks and he hid behind a curtain and talked aloud whilst holding his face in his hat and a guy who owned a printing press wrote down what he said. A lot of what Joe claimed was new biblical scripture was actually taken from the Old Testament. Heres a link explaining the connection: http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/bomn...    Now if you think this is weird; wait, it gets worse! What this Joe Smith claimed was written on these golden plates was that Native Americans are descendants of a lost tribe of Hebrews that somehow made it from the Middle East to the Americas over 2000 years ago. He claimed they founded civilizations and fought wars with each other and apparently Jesus even visited the Americas. DNA evidence alone proves that what this guy said about Native Americans being descendants of Hebrews is nonsense. There has NEVER been any evidence found of pre-Colombian Hebrew civilizations in America. Heres a link to what the Smithsonian Institute has to say about the Book of Mormon; http://www.lightplanet.com/response/Smit...    Mormons used to practice polygamy and some of them still do but mainstream Mormons try to distance themselves from the polygamous ones. The Mormons who are the most fervent believers of their phony doctrine and do their utmost to spread Mormonism get special treatment in the temples and are rewarded with special underwear which has Masonic symbols sewn into it. Mormons believe this underwear protects them from bullets, fire, knife wounds etc. They have weird ceremonies in their temples and only favored Mormons are allowed access to the temples during these ceremonies. Mormons are expected to give 10% of their gross income to their church; if the church leaders feel as though their members arent giving enough of their income to the church, they are interviewed by the church leaders and have to explain their actions. If Mormons leave the church and dont attend services anymore, they are hounded by other members of the church for a while, then all contact is broken with them and friends and family are discouraged by the church to contact the member who has left.    Mormons used to be considered a racist cult as well, listed right alongside the KKK. They used to have as part of their doctrine judgment from their god that people with dark skin were cursed folk unequal to white people and people with dark skin werent allowed to attain high positions in the Mormon hierarchy. It was during the civil rights movement of the 60s that the Mormon leaders realized that society had shifted and laws were changed outlawing segregation and discrimination against dark skinned people. The Mormon leaders, each claiming they were prophets of the Christian god, claimed that they had received revelation from this god that the Mormon doctrine had to change to allow dark skinned people better treatment in the Mormon churches. This was a similar occurrence when they had to give up polygamy in order for the Mormon home state of Utah to be granted status as a state; again the Mormon leaders claimed they had revelation from the Christian god outlawing polygamy even though the founders of Mormonism were known polygamists.    Mormons believe lies; blatant lies. They try to make other people believe their lies too. They are active proselytizers and if you ever encounter a Mormon, its almost guaranteed they will try to get you to join their organization and believe the lies that they believe. They claim things like, Oh, but I am a law abiding person and I have a happy life and a good family and even if my religion is based on untruths, I can live with that because eI know it makes me a better person. Sure, believing nonsense can make people into decent law abiding folk who are good parents, but its such a trade off. They trade reason and accountability for delusion. They trade intellect and individuality for delusion. They trade their freakin humanity for delusion.    If the missionaries were honest, they would tell people right from the start about the weird tenets of the Mormon faith. They would tell them things like, underwear with Masonic symbols on them, Jesus going to America, ancient tribes of Jews in America for which no evidence exists, golden plates, seer stones, magical glasses and the 'prophet' reading out his prophecy whilst holding his face in a hat. Of course, if the missionaries blurted out this stuff to everyone they meet, they wouldn't get many conversions (unless they start going to mental health institutions) but anything short of this is inherently dishonest.    Mormonism as a business; compare it to McDonalds  they both started in the USA, they both took an existing product, jazzed it up and marketed it in a different way, they have both spread all over the globe, they both recognize the financial benefits of getting children hooked to their product, they both update their menu/doctrine along with societal changes, they both have high paid lawyers on their pay roll, they have both made truck loads of cash, they both make out that they do good in the c|`|c345a0234bc2cff30d382612a53c4eb9aa	Well, the Priesthood is mainly what we are talking about here. Christ appointed his original twelve apostles, and they were given the Priesthood, namely, the authority to act in the name of God.    The lineage of this priesthood was broken when the apostles were killed, and it was taken from the earth. That lineage was restored to the earth by Peter James and John.    Without the proper authority, the ordinances such as baptism and confirmation of the Spirit upon a person are not valid.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	There were a few big differences between Joseph Smith and other church founders from other religions, respectable as they may be:    Joseph Smith had no education to draw men to him as authoratative in religions.    He was a 14 year old boy seeking to know which church to join, not wanting to start one but join one.    He had no congragational following when he was called a prophet.      This young man walked into woods to pray after finding turmoil in his mind not knowing what to do and then finding a desire in his heart to know the will of God, and God carried him forward in his quest for truth as He does all of us.    The miracle of the restoration is revelation, not just to a prophet but to us as individuals as well.  So we read the bible and hear the miracles as things that hapen today rather than God's past mercies.      The keys to knowing this for yourself can be found by reading the story of Joesph Smith and pondering about it in your heart - there will come a point in which you feel something good about the story, intense desire to follow it, and feelings of peace.  This is God manifesting the truth, such feelings will grow and can be confirmed by prayer.    Joseph Smith was the instument through which Jesus Christ restored His church from a long falling away that happened and was happening in the New Testament.    The greatest part is that nobody is asking you to blindly believe on his words, rather experiment on his words through faith and study then do what he did, ask God to show you truth.    I'll leave my witness, I know what he claims to have seen actually happened.  If I could have somehow been in that grove of trees and seen that wonderous vision, I'd know no more then than I do now that Joseph Smith did see God the Father and Jesus Christ.    There is great power in knowing something from a pure source such as God, nobody can take it away from me.|`|g7XmorbCaa	After the last Disciple had died on Earth the Priest hood was taken away-Anyone could baptize -But no one had the authority to without the priesthood.

I'll try to answer, but I suggest that you also sit down and talk to the missionaries who have the time to answer all of your questions.  You might also go to mormon.org where you can get some more in depth information.    What is the restoration?  When something is lost then it must be restored.  The true gospel of Jesus Christ as established by himself was lost as the apostles died off and those left in charge changed the gospel to suit their own needs and designs.  A few of these things were:  Baptism by immersion, the priesthood authority, temple worship, serving without pay, baptizing infants and thinking that they were consigned to hell if they were not baptized, killing in the name of the Lord those who did not believe as they believed, picking and choosing what writings were to be included in the Bible.  Not allowing the general population a chance to study and read the bible.  Changing the true concept of the Godhead to suit their perceptions.  This was done around 360 A.D. at the Niceene Council.  Their are many many more. Many fell away and started their own churches.  These became the Protestant religions, but none had the authority or right to start up Christ's church again.  Only this could be given by Jesus Christ himself. This restoration did occur in the 1800's to Joseph Smith.     Can you see how these things would be abominable to God?  How he would choose a young backwoods boy who was not yet set in his ways and who was pure in heart to speak to.     In Theselonians Ch 2 vs.3 Paul speaks of this "falling away" in connection with the Last Days in preparation to the time when Christ will return:   Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;     You can know if this is Christ's church for yourself too.  It requires learning about his gospel, and then finally coming to the point of asking God in prayer.  The best way to find out for sure if it is true is to   meet with the missionaries and start to learn about the gospel and to begin to ask questions.  Don't be afraid the journey is fun and no one is going to force you to join.      I would like to tell you that I have found so much joy and happiness from my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  It brings joy into my life everyday, and into the lives of my family.  I can truly say that every good thing comes from it and that is saying allot.

It seem to me that the "so many things I want to take care of" gets in my way more than it doesn't.

Erdman wrote:  "While the Master does appreciate all that we undertake for Him, He knows that our first need is to sit at His feet and learn His will; then in our tasks we shall be calm and peaceful and kindly, and at last our service may attain the perfectness of that of Mary when in a later scene she poured upon the feet of Jesus the ointment, the perfume of which still fills the world."|`|ZqzXpCnYaa	Find out for yourself by sitting at his feet (if you can see him) and listening to his voice (if you can hear him)  May be the true believers can chime in here.

So I'd suggest for her favorite brand name, and finding the perfect ring, then just getting it engraved with the words "Always Love." or something on the lines of that, perhaps her name and yours then the date you guys got together, personally I think it's really sweet though.

bn0oXqDcaa	Thalia seems to be bluffing.    Yes darling, Muslims should also LOVE one another and love others too. We are taught to love each other or else we should forget about entering paradise.    "You cannot enter paradise unless you become a total believer and you won't become a total believer unless you love each other."   - Muhammad (pbuh)    ALso he is allowed to love a christian because they are considered from the Book (people of the book) just as jews are.|`|zBqt99avaa	This isn't about Islam.  The guy is racist, end of story.    As a Christian woman, I agree with you completely about how God would want us to see our fellow man.  Moreover, the man I'm marrying, a Muslim, agrees with us both.  In Islam, all people, of all races are equal.  But not all Muslims practice this.    He should know better.  At the end of the day, it's very hard to get a racist individual to change their attitude.  If you don't want to spend your life listening to derogatory remarks directed to ethnic minorities, and you don't want to raise your children to agree with that mentality, don't get involved with this man.    On a final note, Muslim men (and women) aren't *supposed* to get involved with anyone before marriage.  It sounds like this guy doesn't practice his faith well, which is none of my business, but you therefore can not expect the general Islamic rules to apply to his attitudes, beliefs and behaviours.    EDIT:  err, new final note.  I just read some of the other answers...I'm getting married to a Muslim.  He in no way has encouraged me to leave Christianity, and has instead found ways to compromise and accomodate my faith, while I have done the same with his.  Religiously, Muslim men are allowed to marry Christian and Jewish women.  I'm sorry I ignored that portion of your question, but really, the issue you raised had nothing to do with Islam, since his behaviour goes against it's teaching.    Good luck.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, but the problem is that Islam teaches that infidel women are unclean whores.

What this guy is saying is so wrong and completely against Islam. Good for you that you are advising him to let go of this ignorance, because thats not what Islam teaches. Muslims arent taught to hate one another and be negative like this. We are all brothers and are all equal, no one is better than the other, whether he is Muslim or non-Muslim, and regardless of nationalities. From the Noble Quran:    49:13  O Mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (Not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most Righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things).     And yes, Christian women are People of the Book, just like Jews are so Muslim men can be with them and it works out great. Christian and Jewish women arent forced to become Muslims either, like everyone thinks. Best of luck to you, sis. Salam alaikom :)

Quizs sean tomados a menos porque como ya mencionaron arriba, los heteros los odian por ser raritos y los homos por que comparten con los heteros...  Aunque creo qu'eso ya no es ms, es decir lo de los homos VS bisex, creo que los homos y los bisex estn muy unidos...    La gran mayoria de la gente es bisexual, est comprobado que nadie puede sur un total 100% heterosexual, muchos hombres y mujeres fantasean  lo han hecho con alguien del mismo sexo pero como es algo "raro" ni siquiera lo comentan...    Ahora, lo de que se les toma en broma, esto es porque la mayoria de los bisexuales, ya sean hombres  mujeres, terminan siendo homos; me pongo como ejemplo, cundo me acepte como "diferente" cre ser bisexual y m'enga?aba a m mismo, y a las personas que me abra les deca qu'era bi, conforme fui entendiendome mejor a m mismo me acept como gay y comenc a decirlo a los dems, s los sac un poco d'onda ("No qu'eras bisexual???")...  Creo que yo lo haca, quizs alguien ms comparta conmigo en esto, porque siendo bisexual ests ms cerca de lo "normal" que siendo homo...

Llego a la conclusion de q la diversidad sexual se podia dividir en 6 tipos, de acuerdo con niveles: el cero era totalmente hetero, el 3 era totalmente bisex, y el 6 era totalmente homo. Los otros, eran un niveles de bisex, de acuerdo al grado de gusto por hombres o mujeres.    Tambien obtuvo porcentajes, el bisex pertenece aprox. a un 10% o 15% de la poblacion humana.

Un bisexual no necesita organizarse para ser aceptado, puede pasar por heterosexual sin que le suponga una traicin a si mismo tan definitiva. Adems, en la bisexualidad entraran  los dos sexos ?no? y organizarse sera ms complicado. Ojal hubiese saunas bisex, pero creo que serian muy complicadas de organizar, habra gente de sensibilidades muy diferentes acudiendo.

0bd782c570e7c004ca33175a9f0aff68aa	Yes, Hebrew 'el' and Arabic 'illah' both come from the common Semitic word 'il' meaning god. There is some argument as to whether the word 'Elohim' is the same root, as the plural of 'el' ('elim') also exists in the bible. However, in several instances, 'Elohim' is translated in the plural, i.e. Psalms 82:6, which seems to confirm that it is from the same root as 'el'. As you point out, 'Allah' is the definite form of 'illah'.  As for the early Israelite tribes being polytheistic, there is a mountain of evidence, both from the Bible itself, and from archaeological excavations to prove that they were indeed polytheistic. Most mainstream scholars agree that monotheism did not come about until around the time of the exile (6th century BCE). 2 recent and excellent books on this topic are:  Mark S. Smith - 'The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts', and William G. Dever - 'Did God Have a Wife?: Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel'. I would highly recommend them.  Many Christian apologists ignore this evidence, and insist that Israel was always monotheistic. These people often selectively use a little bit of linguistic analysis (without really understanding it) to support their arguments, while ignoring other important facts. One could argue that Muslims are more monotheistic than Christians, since Christians believe in the Trinity while Muslims strongly affirm that there is only one God. I think the real issue here is what are Christian apologists trying to sell? It seems to me that most of these Muslim-bashers are trying to get people to buy into all the right wing foreign policy crap that says that America has some sort of God given right to invade foreign countries and kill tens of thousands of people in order to fight 'evil' and spread 'democracy'.  That doesn't sound very Christian to me.|`|AA11407961	Yes, Hebrew elohim is related to Arabic allah.  No, it doesn't indicate that Judaism was originally polytheistic, any more than a king who calls himself "we" believes that he is sitting on another king's lap.  In fact, the word "elohim" when referring to God is *singular* as demonstrated by the fact that it takes singular verbs.  Moreover,the language we call "Hebrew" today was originally "Canaanite".  The Canaanites *were* polytheistic...but language isn't *proof* of this fact, any more than it is a proven "fact" that English-speakers can't think of anything but food.  After all, when they wake up in the morning, the first thought is how they didn't eat all night!!  That's why they call the morning meal "break fast".    To the best of my knowledge "illah" is not related to any moon god, either.  I have never seen this claimed (and I didn't see it on the Web page you referenced), and anyway--just because someone claims something doesn't mean it's true.

The apostle Paul writes to Christians in Galatia that there is neither slave nor freeman, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one person in union with Christ Jesus. All have an independent spiritual standing before God; yet all are united as a body of his servants. All are alike in Gods household.Galatians 3:26-28    The differences center on teaching and authority. Women are barred from serving in an official teaching capacity in the congregation and from exercising spiritual authority over fellow congregation members. In his pastoral letter to Timothy, Paul plainly states: I do not permit a woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.1 Timothy 2:12.    Paul next points to the basis for not allowing women to be teachersa divinely appointed relationship between man and woman. For Adam was formed first, then Eve, he writes. (1 Timothy 2:13) God could have created Adam and Eve at the same moment, but he did not. Adam existed for some time before Eve. Does this not reveal Gods purpose for Adam to direct, to be the head, rather than Eve? (1 Corinthians 11:3) And to teach is, in effect, to act as a master, or head, over those taught. Those taught listen and quietly learn. Thus, in the congregation only men are to be teachers and overseers.    Need the fact that women do not teach in the congregation cause frustration and resentment? No. Women are free to teach Christian doctrine and are invited to do so. In what context and under what circumstances? Older women can be teachers of what is good to the younger women. And just as Eunice and her mother Lois instructed Timothy, so Christian women still follow their example in training children in The Way of the truth.Titus 2:3-5; Acts 9:2; 2 Timothy 1:5.|`|AA11612734	fraid i didnt sry mayb ask better questions
7Z0COO62aa	You seem to be asking why God doesn't force clarity and understanding.  Good question.    What if God wants us to have a choice in believing, and/or wants us to accept on the basis of faith as opposed to forcing us (as the Bible indicates)?  He has shown Himself in nature (cause/effect, order, moral awareness of mankind) and in history (Jesus Christ, prophets, scripture) and people can choose to accept or deny.  He has given instruction, and people can follow it or choose to confuse it by adding/subtracting things or otherwise changing it.    As another posted answer mentioned, an all-powerful God could take control of the TVs or speak to the modern world through a burning bush, but would that convince everyone?  I would suggest that many would still reject or confuse the message and would assume that it was a fake or that science would eventually explain it away as not really God (not to knock science -- I'm a big fan -- but I run into this response constantly when discussing logical reasons to accept God's existence).    Humanity is free to accept or reject miracles, prophets, the Messiah, the historical record, and the direction science points.  For whatever reason, God seems to prefer willing belief instead of forced belief, and those same freedoms have left room for people to confuse the issues.  Christian theism also allows for a deceiver (Satan) and a human nature capable being deceived (by self or Satan).    The only way God could make it clearer would be to remove our ability to think and/or our ability to be deceived.  He could do that, but then we are nothing more than puppets.  If God has any other purpose for us (fellowship, willing love, moral freedom), forced clarity and understanding would undermine that purpose.    So an omnipotent God certainly could force knowledge and understanding, but is not required to.  He can choose to provide sufficient information and allow a choice.  I wish things were more clear and widely accepted, but at the same time I'm thankful we are not forced to be robots.  And I'm glad you are asking this question -- don't give up!|`|AA10493307	It is a question of perception.

OK. very good question. I would think an omnipotent being would not have a problem expressing itself in modern times.   the human brain is more developed. it is ready to receive all input.  this omnipotent being should be able to control the very thing that makes all modern  communications possible on planet earth. the electron.  radio, TV, computers are all a better way to communicate.    I suppose a burning bush telling the world what it expects from humanity would do just as well.   I think all the people would except any kind of direct expression of power and authority.    self appointed god proxies and old books written by these proxies is a poor way to communicate with the modern world.|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	Like the previous answerer opined, its actually a question of perception.

Please don't suck to hard on this thought, little assault was intended.    Honestly though, of course a "believer" thinks God speaks clearly.

Yea man, you got some of the main ones:  -Bro, friendly way of saying Mate/Friend  -Sweet as, can be used in allmost any situation. Its just saying 'yes thats fine.' Like if someone hits you accidentlly say 'sweet as bro' but only if you use the correct accent.    To be honest, if you wanna pick up NZ culture in the common class and all the popular slang would be by watching a show called 'Bro Town' on Youtube or something. Its sweet as bro!

NirBfNfMaa	Travelling overseas is very expensive. Americans also get much less vacation time than people in other parts of the world (usually 2 weeks a year). Trying to get time off work to travel is difficult. It usually takes a year to accumulate 2 weeks of vacation time.    After graduating from college in a few months, I am going to Europe. My plane ticket will cost around $2,000 roundtrip (people on the east coast might have it cheaper. I have to fly all the way to New York in order to fly to Europe).    I am going to Europe for 2 months, which is pretty awesome. The only way I can do this is because my student job ends anyway (because I won't be a student anymore) and I have some good money saved up. Once I enter the full-time work world, I doubt I will have such an opportunity like this again.    Many of us would like to travel more often, but it's just too expensive.    Another thing: Americans with dual citizenship can travel on either country's passport, so if you already have a passport form another country you don't really need to get an American passport. Things like this may skew the data.    Also, you only need a passport card, not a passport to travel by ground to Canada and Mexico. I know that is not overseas but it might skew the data downward for the number of passport holders.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	Im pretty sure that statistic is inaccurate my aunt has been to Africa, London, and India.

swkhohjgaa	You don't mention how old you are. That may make some difference in how i would approach things as to how and when. But, basically I believe nothing worth having in life is without out risk. You've seen the results of not coming out.  Find a local group, make a plan, get out there, life is waiting.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	Oh sweety, don't waste another minute in the closet. The whole world is out there waiting to be discovered. Sure, being gay is difficult sometimes, but you can have a wonderful, happy, fullfilling life with friends and lovers and families. You are missing out on the gay pride parades! You are missing out on drag shows. You are missing out because some have taught you that beinggay is a bad thing. The only bad thing is not living your life.    Please contact the local gay center  or PFLAG. ORG. It is a wonderful org to support the families and friends of LGBT people. You can ask for pamphlets to help family and friends understand and if there is a chapter nearby, your family can come to the meetings and meet other families in the same situation.   I knew I was different but didn't get it until I was 27 and already married --- to a guy who treated me nicely. I didn't know any better until I fell for my first woman. Holy mackeral! Then I knew why my marriage was going no where fast. We split up. I talked to a young man, about my age, at the gay cente r and walked out of there feeling like a princess. I had my whole life ahead of me and couldn't wait to start exploring. I'll be 60 shortly and still exploring. I guess I'm glad I didn't know earlier on because there was nothing available for us back then: few bars but no social clubs, no groups, nothing on tv- nothing positive anyway.   Get out there. Ask PFLAG for a referral to a gay friendly counselor so you can talk without prejudice. Find out what social groups are out there. Here in the Chicago area, it is unlimited. But don't waste another day living in the closet because of society's prejudices.    You said you were a gay, sort of.......... What does that mean????You don't value yourself as a man? A man doesn't have to be macho to be a man. Most of my gay male friends were definitely not macho and I loved them. Please feel free to write to me if you need a shoulder. I do expect to hear reports of you getting out there and being yourself.Have a great life. Stop wasting it.|`|hzqvVFQsaa	hey ...well im a guy but im like 15 so if its no help then sorry but i come out to my family and friends about being bisexual about one year ago and they was really shocked and at school people made fun and it was hard at first because no one expected it because sometimes at school when you can tell some boys are gay the straight people just get over it and when they finally come out there isnt a big deal coz it was expected but for me they didnt and it was hard so really i think that if you are going to come out then think how u will cope with  people and how they react but its not their life so I would .... but i cant really say coz i like girls to but im like more gay but its confusing becuase you never know how people feel about you and after a while people get bored of you and they find something else to gossip about lol ... it gets easier lol ..  you should say how old you are

MvZMA5BGaa	Are you asking why some non Christian men and women attempt to slide off onto Christians the responsibility to repent and be saved that God has placed squarely on their own shoulders?  Because they are foolish.    Okay, ridicule?  Pretty much the same reason but also because it is a vain attempt to direct attention away from themselves in regards to their own sin.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	I don't understand your question.
Mnm35sjNaa	IF there were a Holy Spirit as defined by Christian religions, then yes, its unsolicited intervention would be against free will.  However, if you solicited the intervention by the Holy Spirit, that would conform to free will.    Darwin's natural selection tells us that our greatest attribute (intelligence) is necessarily evolved to do what it does: make choices.  Whether or not free will is God-given, evolved or an illusion is not really the issue.  We do, in fact, make choices.  The real question is: In a deterministic universe, ruled by causality, can free will also exist?    There's no proof for ANY answer.  I, personally, believe that free will coexists with determinism.  I believe living beings can't be viewed in the same light as inanimate objects (stars, planet, atoms, comets, chairs, rocks, etc.)  The free will we have is limited in as much as our options are limited.  We are not gods and are confined to physical laws.    The field of neuroscience has made large strides recently but the free will versus determinism controversy is nowhere closer to resolution.  Determinism and compatibilism have both garnered supporting evidence (though determinism seems to have the edge for now).  Google "CEMI theory" for more information about a leading theory that supports compatibilism.    For argument's sake, I'll assume there is a God who gave us free will.  If he did, then he can no longer intervene in human affairs: that would be usurping our free will.  That means that God CAN'T be a personal God who meddles in our affairs (answer prayers, perform miracles, slay enemies, wipe out cities, etc.).  Once he gave us free will, he switched from personal God to cosmic God . . . from meddler to observer.    But if God did NOT give us free will, we are merely puppets dancing to God's tune.  We would have no morality, responsibility or accountability.    Christian apologists have tried, for hundreds of years, to explain away this logical conundrum.  But they can't (without resorting to circular logic).  If you insist on a supernatural creator, then God either gave us free will or he didn't.  If he didn't, he judges and punishes us for lives we had no control over.  If he did, then all his interventions described in the bible contradict the free will he supposedly gave us.    The question of free will cuts to the core of scriptural legitimacy and reveals the lies that dogma is intended to cover up.|`|RCn1Y3Ogaa	Not according to the believers, but I do think so.    -  We never had free will in the first place. the choices we make are always constantly being influenced by our experiences. Would you choose to take left or right? If your experience always shown that left took you to a better road, then you'd choose left, and disregard right because left is much more comfortable and you had the foreknowledge of the road being correct.|`|K788nNsbaa	1. nO  2.

There's no proof, or disproof, that the Holy Spirit acts -just- to obtain belief.|`|DYnvacFVaa	The holy spirit is only something believers in Christ have, it guides us and helps us to know when something is not right.  When we are about to do something which may be harmful or be around someone who isnt not what they seem we get a feeling inside, an uneasy feeling.  Same when something is right, God can guide us to speak to someone or do something kind for someone.  It helps us to make the right choice, the choice is still ours to make.  I some times feel we have to much free will, and i worry i dont make the right choices, but if you walk close with God, he will guide your path.

DufwciPjaa	LOL...Simple..They teach the Japanese kids the same way they teach American kids.    They start with numbers, and colors.    Then I think you should start with the basic words like...(mom, dad, arm, leg, ear, head, toes...ect.)    Working into the common words...(the, who, what, where, when, why, car, train, bike, plane...ect.)    Then working into the more advanced common words like...(love, hate, alive, breathing, dead...ect.)     You should really master those first....    After you master those words, you can then start putting what you've learned into sentence's per say:    Too Hate, is too love....(a common wise saying)    Nimo Kurai, is nimo koigokuro....(japanese way of saying the above)      You also should make sure you learn the male/female side of the Japanese launguage. Whichever you are.     My new years resolution is to learn Japanese too.  So this is kinda the base of my plan...  You should also try ordering disc's off ebay or Amazon.com    They could help ALOT.    I started off with google (hehe)  To learn the basics, and commons...    I'm currently looking for an Enligsh To Japanese Dictionary :)  Great way to learn alot of Japanese    Hope this helped...If so rate me or what/not.    Enjoy!
YoHroOcGaa	People aren't perfect and thinking of sex or porn is not a sin, it's human nature. You can't avoid sin in this world.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Completely impossible, that was the whole point of the rule.  By making it physically impossible not to sin the Church also made itself the only way to avoid eternal damnation.  This gave the Clergy tremendous political and societal power which they then used to make themselves the closest thing to a world government that has ever existed.  A lot of the Fundamentalist Churches are still doing it, and the fact that they see their power diminishing steadily in today's increasingly diverse and secular world is why they fight so hard to prevent any further changes.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Well, according to Christians, if the person is thinking about their spouse, it wouldn't be sinful at all.    But really, according to Christian teaching, we are all sinners- born sinners, and expected to do sinful things.

Nobody is expected to be sinless.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	thank goodness I am an atheist and don't have to worry whether my  sex life is approved of by the church.

Be proud of what you KNOW you are... what you want to be, i.e. (white) is irrelevant.

0kWsC3Uhaa	They are turning off the old-style analogue signal.  This is the way TV was broadcast originally, in like a wave pattern.  Digital is broadcast in a digital (binary) signal which means less corruption of the signal over distance and a clearer picture.    This is a natural progression.  It's happening in all countries - in Australia the analogue gets turned off in 2012 I think, but we're a little behind the US.      It's not that they're forcing people to switch to digital, it's that they're turning off the old signal so you won't be able to receive it anymore.    They've done this with cell phone networks.  People had to buy new phones.  It's the same thing.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	to free up the airwaves|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	They are going to use the analog for emergency responses only.

And I like Feminine Girls,You know girls who wear sexy skirts and dress really girly. So for me is better having more choices to choose from. And having sex with a male well it's pretty great actually since guys do know what they like.

People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|AA10098101	1. God is there, He is watching, He does care.  This world is run by men, and is under the jurisdiction of satan.  In the same way an apartment has a tenant, an apartment manager, and an owner; we are the tenants satan manages, and God owns it.  The owner, even though he owns the building, cannot enter without the permission of the tenant.  God follows His own laws.    2. There is an abundance of proof for Jesus being the only way.   1, He said so.  The Old Testament accurately describes the events of Jesus' life as written by many different people over a period of thousands of years, known to have been written over 200 years before Jesus was born.  The odds of such prophesies coming true is a few million trillion to one.  Jesus is the only way.    3. Homosexuality is not something someone is born with.  There is no "homosexual gene".  It is either a psychological issue (usually related to sexual trauma in childhood) or a result of society.  Everyone is created equal, but what people do after they're created is what makes some better than others.    4. The proof of God is all around us.  The wonders of nature scream "Creator".  Nothing "just happens".  Explosions create chaos.  Time does more harm than good.  For any system to go from chaos to order, energy must be applied; but it must be applied with purpose and intelligently (as much energy as the sun gives us, just applying it to something, say a soft-top, only causes decay and disorder.  The only things that actually uses sunlight with any degree of chaos>order are plants during photosynthesis.  Everything is created, nothing was not.    5. People are precious, though they do tend to be overall stupid.  Though many people do say it is "just a fetus", it is, in fact, a human being.  From the moment the sperm hits the egg, it is a human.  As a father, I have seen my baby in the womb kicking, sucking her thumb, and responding to my voice.  No animal is capable of that.  She was alive, even before her birthday.    Besides, when do we make the distinction?  Is any child not a burden?  Why don't people get to try it out for a few years, see if they like it or not?  Should we let people abort their 13 year old kids when they really become a nuisance?  Why is there a difference? People all over the world want to adopt babies, whether they can't conceive or just want more, there is a good home waiting for any child that comes to Earth.      6. Carbon dating is based on assumptions.  It is really only accurate to a couple hundred years.  Often times when carbon dating is done, the process is tried a few dozen times, with wildly different answers (for instance, a single frozen mammoth was dated with a span of over 3000 years.  not accurate at all) and only the answers that fit the model of the geologic column are kept; everything else is thrown out.    Fossils are petrified bones, skin, pieces of previously organic tissues.  They tell us that a certain creature or plant lived and died.  Fossils are not dated by carbon dating, as it won't give the so-called scientists the results they want for sure; so they are dated by their location in the geologic column (which by the way is not found intact anywhere in the world) which is in turn dated by the fossils found in those "layers" of earth.    Thinking is certainly not a bad habit, but keep an open mind. Don't just buy something because it was said by a "scientist" or a "professional".  Do your own research.  That's what the scientific method is all about.    I don't claim to be a Christian, too many that have done so have pretty much ruined the reputation.  I am a follower of Jesus, who stood up against organized religion in His own time.  When religion gets organized, people and tradition get in the way; and that pretty much ruins it for everyone involved.  (Don't get me wrong, I am for church; fellowship is crucial to one's walk with God.)  Jesus is the way, and I'm just following Him.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Christians this, Christians that.  You've met some pretty lousy specimens.  In particular    "evolution. Christians shy away from the topic every time I mention it, saying God created all life and the world is only a few thousand years old."    is simply not true.  Most Christians know that evolution is a fact, don't have a problem with it, think YE creationism is ridiculous and relish good science.  Please don't judge us all by the fundies.    You're an intelligent guy or at least know how to use a spell check, which is a relative rarity around here, but I don't think you are very interested in Christianity or you would know that the picture you paint of it is extremely distorted.  I'd give you some answers but since your last sentence admits to a closed mind, what's the point?|`|2MP9nYLdaa	God is real brother and loves you. You were created to have an intermate relationship with him. Yes being gay is a sin as God created a man and a women to be married in a loving relationship and become one flesh. God loves the gays too but wants them to repent because God is a Holy God and wants his people to holy themselfs before Him. God loves everyone mate and God is no respector of persons. God wants everyone to humble themselfs before him. Jesus died for all the sins in the world. There is nothing God cannot forgive. I had a terrible life of sin before I came to know God. I was getting drunk, pubs, stealing stuff, fraud I had 2 abortians. my life was a mess. I am not saying becasue I have become born again my life is roses. It still has its ups and downs but I know who is with me when I go through trials and I can ask Him for help and he does. God does not promise things to be easy but he says he will help us through them if we seek Him with all our hearts. Adam and Eve as you know disobeyed God in Eden the Garden. so as a result the earth was cursed. Jesus came to resore back our relationship with the Father by dying in our place so we can be forgiven by having a relationship wiht Jesus the Saviour of the world and by repenting to God who will forgive you if you ask after having given your life to God's Son Jesus. and you will have eternal life with Him in Heaven after you die. God bless you|`|CjRfJbncaa	The *chief enemy* of the Creator is the one who is temporarily the 'ruler of this world'---It is Satan who is doing such a horrible job, *not* Jehovah God!

(I think the simple answer is OF COURSE) so your just as bad as Adam and Eve. The world is cursed not just because of Adam and Eve's sin, it it because of the sin of you and of me....If you lived perfectly and never sinned than you can say that it's not fair that the Earth is cursed....homosexuality is a sin, it says so many times in the Bible...I say this all the time to people....NO ONE was born with homosexuality. Period. People were born with sin. This is just another way for people to disobey God. Proof that God exists is all around you ....just look around at the sky, and the trees....you have to think that there is an intelligent designer....Scientists cannot prove the age of the Earth...they can try but they can't prove it...and fossils, they actually help prove that the Earth is young (that's a whole different discussion and I can't get into that right now) Well I hope this cleared up a few things for you.....|`|CHMfm6bXaa	It all comes down to the Free will he gave us.  if we all followed his word then there would far less violence and wars.      It also says you shall not lay with one of the same gender.    The best way not to get pregnant is to not have sex.  It is that simple.    I have never shied away from the topic and I believe the Earth is older than a dew thousand years.  That was made along time ago before science became as firm as it is today.  We still have along way to go.  I don't doubt Dinosaurs lived a few million years ago.  I believe that God created the things that would later form planets and us.

He's a crack pot and a douche bag.|`|AA10242809	First, I am so sorry for your loss...  but concerning your dream, I would ask you if there are issues or things that you wish you could have resolved with your dad before he died?  Things that are making it hard for you to let go or find peace.  This was what happened to me when both my mother and father died.  Now, I'm going to make an assumption.  You mention being in church in your dream.  Are you a Christian and do you go to church?  If so, see if your pastor knows about a ministry program called "Father's Love".  If not, see if you can find out about it.  What happens with this is where a man you know and trust will stand in for your father and let you tell him the things you wish you could have told your real father before he died.  The man will respond in a way like what your dad might have.  For me, there were things I needed to forgive my father, I needed to hear him tell me he loved me and I needed to tell him goodbye.  When my church did it, there were a lot of people that this was done for and there were grown men who were crying like babies at being able to forgive their fathers for all kinds of different things.    I know that it really helped me, and the man who "stood in" for my father has continued to be a little like a dad to me...  I pray that you will find peace and comfort and hope you have people who love you and will help you in dealing with this loss.  I hope this has helped.  I'm thinking maybe God woke me up at 4:00am so I could try to answer your question...

Both Paradise and Hell are eternal    Be successful in this life and after death    In the name of GOD the most compassionate and the most merciful  Parise be to God the creater of all that exists. We praise him and ask him for help and forgiveness. We ask him for protection from evilness within ourselves and from our bad deeds. Whoever God Guides to truth no one will lead astray. And whomever God leads astray no one will ever guide. I testify no god but God to whom there is no partner and I testify prophet Muhammad is his server and messenger.

Mary  http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/QURAN/1...    www.islam.org    Time is running out on everyone, Accept the truth|`|2h8tqOeFaa	Have you not read the bible, i guess not.. I suggest you read it as soon as possible and gain some wisdom..     Edit: Hey if you don't believe then don't worry about the consiquences you don't believe in..     What gets me is the worrying of a non believer in his fate, if God does not exist to you then why feel bad about the non existent fate that's applied..     Is it because of doubt, is there a slight bit of wisdom seeping through, there should be because God does exist, and we who believe has had the same proof has you've had, there is no extra proof to give but ones own wisdom to what one hears and sees..|`|nwdwKnS7aa	Don't be impatient, He'll come for a visit eventually!

"Allah" is a false god and denies the deity of Jesus Christ.  "Allah" may grant heaven based on works, but no one can know for certain.    The truth is God offers eternal life to those who repent and forsake sin and believe in the free gift of grace offered through Jesus Christ.    ------------  I don't mind if you disagree with me, that is your privledge, but the character attack is unnecessary, however I forgive you and may God bless you!|`|3ca4dacd96f4cd56d438113724dcb3cbaa	"Allah" is the same word used by Christian Arabs and Jewish Arabs in their Bible, centuries before Islam came.(by from the book) you cant say plural of Allah but u can say gods.  if you r muslum than ur god name is Allah no matter where u live.muslim who r russian   polish chinese american mexican or sweden ,the name is   always Allah.|`|h479qjNoaa	Allah is Arabic and God is in English. Some Muslims prefer to keep Allah even in English Language for several reasons including the following reasons.   Allah is unique to the Supreme Being who created this universe. There is no one like Him and physically he is beyond human imagination. The word "Allah" has never been used for anything other than that Supreme Being. There is no plural to Allah and there is no gender associated with it (this is important). This is contrary to the word God, which can be used in the plural, Gods. God is also a masculine noun, which can be feminized into Goddess. Allah has no gender and no plural therefore Muslims maintain that word for the One we worship no matter what language we speak in.|`|e5aWckZYaa	Well the descriptions of them in the holy books they are written are quite different.|`|4RsurY2xaa	spelling|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Muslims refer to God as Allah. Christians refer to him as Jesus or God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|qcEzJDY6aa	First the spelling and 2nd is their believers, they differ in holding the two groups of people: The Muslims to Allah & the Christians to God they just don't understand each other.|`|AA12041870	The real difference is the people that believe.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Some people say that God (Yahweh) and Allah are the same but their origins are different.

Is "Allah" only for Islam and Muslims?  [No! It is for All Three Abrahamic Faiths.]    "Allah" is the same word used by Christian Arabs and Jewish Arabs in their Bible, centuries before Islam came.    On page one [1] of Genesis in the Old Testament, we find the word "Allah" seventeen [17] times.    Every hotel and motel has a Bible. Next time you see one look in the introduction, you will find samples of the different languages they have translated. For Arabic they have translated the verse in the New Testament in Arabic from the famous verse in the Gospel John 3:16 -    "For God so loved the world..."  - and the word the translators used in Arabic for "God" is the very same word used by Muslims around the planet, "Allah."  Where Does the word "Allah" Come From?    "Allah" comes from the Arabic word "elah"a god' or something worshiped. - (Arabic) means '    This word (elah) can be made plural (gods), as in "aleha" and it can be male or female just as the word in English can be "goddess."    "Allah" comes from "elaha" but it brings more clarification and understanding.    Allah = Has no gender (not male and not female)   "He" is used only out of respect and dignity - not for gender  Allah = Always singular - Never plural   "We" is used only as the "Royal WE" just as in English for royalty  Allah = Means "The Only One to be Worshipped"|`|m5aenb6qaa	nothing really|`|OY1WlSKvaa	They're both the same invisible dictator, whose shoes are filled by the Churches, mosques, mullahs, and priests who play "God" with their brainwashed followers lives.|`|lnsNN93oaa	One begins with a vowel and the other with a consonant.

This statement, no doubt anathema to a majority of Christians, Muslims and Jews, is not intended as either a joke or to be taken lightly.    It's a question of perspective.  From inside these religions, it may feel like there's all the difference in the world.  From outside, viewing them all impartially, without all the sturm und drang, the differences become more negligible the further away you are standing.

eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Yawn!    Constitutionally, the only impediment would be if she was a Roman Catholic and didn't convert before she married since the Act of Settlement was enacted in 1701 to keep the Jacobites from succeeding to the British throne. In 1936, Wallis Simpson was in part deemed "unacceptable" because she was a twice-divorced women with a scandalous sexual history and in part because both she and Edward VIII were Nazi sympathizers.     That said, remembering Koo Stark, Princes William and Harry should probably steer clear of Paris and Brittany, although a less than acceptable wife could perhaps be a morganatic queen.  Whether the Prince's stepmother falls in that category is also open to debate.  Even so, a quick survey reveals that many British queens and princesses, including the late Princess Margaret, have had less than sterling histories.     Question:  Why does someone ask this question almost every other day?|`|GHefTsUyaa	Well he's part German-Greek anyway.  Just a born with a silver spoon in his mouth mongrel.|`|olahi6esaa	The only condition would be that the American be a protestant and member of the church of england, otherwise William would have to give up his right to the throne|`|ToztjpAsaa	If you go back far enough they're all "foreigners" - German, mainly, but that shouldn't be a handicap in a brighter, shinier, modern multicultural Britain.

zWaIjJKXaa	There are no true rhymes with month. You'll find that '-nth' words generally have few if any true rhymes.   'Seventh' and 'eleventh' rhyme with each other but no others I can think of.  'Tenth' rhymes only with the expression  'nth' like when people say 'to the 'nth degree'. But that is not a true word.  And amaranth also comes to mind.. no rhymes.   "Uneath" was indeed a word but when an archaic english word is no longer listed in any dictionaries it is arguable whether is still belongs to the language (modern english) or is in fact part of a separate (OE)language. It is also unlikely that it was pronounced as one syllable, meaning it would not truly rhyme anyway.  Neologisms generally require recognition by the greater community before they are considered 'proper' words - 'dunth' is stupid (my opinion) and hasn't been. You can just make up words but they don't 'count' if no one uses them. Except my word that rhymes with month, it's pronounced exactly the same, spelled "munth" and it refers to the so-nasty-you-want-to-run frothy saliva stuff crackheads and various other junkie types have around their mouths.|`|ppKQEhEMaa	Month rhymes with uneath (a very obscure and now archaic word meaning "difficult").       Month also rhymes with the neologism "dunth", which was invented just to have something to rhyme with month. It supposedly means "a word that rhymes with nothing" or "a word that rhymes with month". Dunth does not appear in any major dictionary|`|00gvk1vHaa	I think silver actually rhymes with chilver which is something to do with a female lamb apparently, but don't quote me on it!

AA11992885	what time frame are you looking for.......before Abraham?  Noach alotted the middle east, including Israel, to Shem and his children......over time, the Canaan's children, Canaan the son of Ham, his children, the Canaanites took it over.....to Ham was alotted the land to the south, Africa    in the days of Serug, the land fell to the Canaanites, supposedly  Serug fathered Nahor, Nahor fathered Terah, Terah fathered Abraham, Abraham was promised that the land would be given to his children after an exile of 400 years.........so, from Serug till Joshua, then land was occupied by gentiles    gentiles have almost always lived in Israel throughout the ages    the NATION split into two KINGDOMS after the reign of Solomon, thus causing the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and the Southern Kingdom of Judah............the Northern Kingdom went into exile first, around the 700's BCE i think, and the Southern Kingdom into exile in the 600's i believe    however, even during these later exiles, a remnant of the children of Israel were constant in the land, all be it, the majority of the people were gentiles, as it was common place when one nation conquered another nation, to deport the inhabitance and import people from abroad, so as to try to make them loose their national identity.....but Israel was also founded in its religion, the land was a promise, not an identity    JEWS came back to Israel in the 500's BCE, Jews being the Southern Kingdom, and continued strongly in Israel until around 200 to 300 CE.....something like that, then Rome started deporting|`|AA10852244	How many years was israel occupied by other nation?       LOL!!! There was no israel, and there will never be one.|`|X548yCR6aa	Zero. Israel was founded in 1948 and was never occupied by another nation.    Not for the lack of trying, mind you.   If you refer to the ancient kingdoms, they weren't "occupied", they were destroyed. Devoured, annexed, removed as a political entity.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Since Julius Caesar, the Roman general annexed it through till 1948.    In between Israel was first part of the Roman Empire, then the Eastern Roman Empire, then the Byzantine Empire, then the Arabian Empire of Mohamed, then briefly in the hands of the Crusaders, then over to the Muslim Egypt, then the Empire of the Ottoman Turks, then the British, and finally recolonised by the scattered Jews of Europe and the Middle East.    I'm not sure about the period BC. Biblical dates are a little vague. There is something somewhere about how long the Jews spent in exile in Babylon 597-538 BC, which is about 58 or 59 years depending on the month.|`|9dkONba4aa	Which Israel?  The present State of Israel and the ancient state of Israel are two different entities.  Ancient Israel was occupied at different times by different nations. It was occupied by the Babylonians at one time. At another time , it was occupied by the Assyrians. The ancient state of Israel consisted of two different states. The Northern state or kingdom was called the House of Israel and it's capitol was  Samaria. The Southern state or kingdom was called, the House of Judah and its capitol was Jerusalem. Sometimes one state was occupied and the other was not. There is no state of Israel in the Book of Genesis.  The founding of the State of Israel was when the children of Israel accepted the Law of God at Mount Sinai.  Their flag(curtain) was commanded to be red (scarlet), white(linen) and blue(purple) and gold fringe or trim.(Exodus 36:8) Hung on brass poles.At one point the people were exiled from Israel for 70 years. After the year 70AD after the Temple had been  destroyed and the city of Jerusalem flattened and half the citizens killed and half taken prisoners by the Romans, the Romans took over Israel and banned by law any Jews from entering the new Roman city of Capitolina built over Jerusalem;'s ruins.

Ive read the theory of axial tilt, basically meaning the land under the poles hasnt always been where it is today; if you think of the ice age as some of the more northern lands moving to the north pole, then that would shift antartica to about where australia is now. As australia now lies in a temperate/tropical zone, that would mean antartica would have a lot warmer climate. But axial tilt is not a widely recognised theory but i find it quite plausible for several things...    I really wonder what we could find under those ice sheets...|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Not many of humans, probably of mammals.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	No.  For me the determining factors of civilizations are intelligence and economics.  We have been able to afford people and in fact bringing our civilization to Antarctica in the last century, but before that, the last time Antarctica was relatively affordable (because of climate, not affluence) we or our ancestors could not afford to live outside Africa.

If she can easily just sleep around with whom ever then this is not healthy for you and you made the rite decission... If you give her abreak or take her back out of guilt.. She will know your 110% in to this realationship but sadly and truthfully she will break your heart again.... be strong, I am sure you will find some one, ok!

Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

So it was 11:20 PM when I start the engine.there wasn't traffic,heading towards on the road with an average speed of 70-80mph.All the way home I ain't experience anything strange or something weird.When I got home,believe me or not,it was 2:40 AM.My wife was sleeping,so the kids and my brother.In the morning they said they were waiting for me,and my wife called me too at around 12:30,but I ain't got any missed calls on my cell phone.The only strange thing was with my watch.It wasn't workingI thought I would get home to 12 with that speed.I still don't know what to think|`|8BG2tqTGaa	the goose girl...      A queen sends her daughter - who is betrothed to a prince in a far-off land - to her bridegroom. She sends her with a trousseau, a waiting-maid, and a horse for each of them; the princess's horse is named Falada and has the ability to speak. The queen takes a small knife and cuts herself, putting three drops of her blood onto a white handkerchief and bids her daughter to keep it with her, as it will aid her on her journey.    The princess and her waiting-maid travel for a time, then the princess grows thirsty. She asks the maid to go and fetch her some water, but the girl refuses and so the princess goes and drinks water from the stream from her goblet. The princess sighs and the drops of blood - hidden in the princess's bodice - reply, "If your mother only knew, her heart would surely break in two." The princess and the waiting-maid travel on, and the princess grows thirsty again. By that time, the princess had forgotten the waiting-maid's rude speech earlier and asks the waiting-maid again, "Waiting maid, please fetch me some water with my goblet for I have grew thirsty again." "No," she replies, "if you are thirsty, go and get it yourself. I shall not be your waiting maid any longer." The maid sounded stern and furious, so she stops by herself and drops her goblet to be the same as everyone else. She drinks with her hands. While she is not paying attention, the handkerchief with the drops of blood on it falls out of her bodice and into the stream. The princess does not notice this.    Deprived of the magical protection of her mother's handkerchief and blood, the princess is defenseless when the maid makes her change places, including horses and dresses. When they reach their destination, the maid continues the charade, going so far as to have the princess' horse, Falada, butchered, for fear he will reveal the secret. In addition, she informs the king that the princess is merely a peasant girl procured for the journey and now unneeded. He puts the princess to work in his castle.    The princess - now a goose girl - promises the butcher a piece of gold if he would give Falada a proper burial. The butcher hangs out Falada's head on the wall of the gate. Every morning, as she drives out the geese with Conrad, the goose herder, she sadly greets Falada's head and Falada's head repeats the same words previously spoken by the drops of blood: "If your mother only knew, her heart would surely break in two." Every day, she combs her hair in the pasture. Conrad always tries to steal some of the golden locks, and she charms the wind to blow his hat far away, so he can not return until she is finished.    Conrad goes to the king and declares he will not herd geese with her any longer because of the strange things that happen. The king tells him to do it one more time and watches; when they return, the king asks the princess to tell him her story. She explains that she took an oath not to tell. He tells her to tell her troubles to the iron stove and eavesdrops while she does so. The princess, in her sorrow, tells the entire story - that she is a princess and that her waiting-maid has conspired against her.    Upon learning this, the king causes royal garments to be given to her as befits her station, and brings her to the prince's attention. At dinner later that evening, everyone has eaten and drunk and are quite merry. The princess and the waiting-maid are present, although the waiting-maid does not recognize the princess in her new finery. The king tells the princess's story without naming any names, and asks the waiting-maid what the appropriate punishment would be. The waiting-maid answers that such a person should be put naked into a barrel lined with nails, which should be dragged by horses from street to street until the person is dead. The sentence is carried out on her, and the prince marries the true princess.        collected by the grimm brothers  (not by me)|`|2dke6ChJaa	i'll tell you the fable of the fairy princess who asked the wrong question in the great castle and was laughed at by all the villagers...|`|t8f3uvr5aa	The best stories are the true ones..see below|`|tonbgPtVaa	My girlfriend just starts screaming and swearing while sleeping for like 10 seconds then stops and makes no sence usually. its like a terets sleeping disorder      Apparently when I was younger (around 7), my mother noticed me wandering around the house late at night, she followed me, and found me sitting on the toilet, fully clothed, just sort of hanging out, twiddling my thumbs.       erm when we lived in apartments I guess I unlocked our fron door and walked outside and down the street..my aunt lived by us so I guess she saw me..it was weird.     if you want more stories feel free 2 im me williamisthecoolest13@hotmail.com|`|ppKQEhEMaa	There once was an evil fairy, Firewings, who lived by himself in an old beeve hive in the forest of Bubblegum Sprinkle Land.     Bubblegum Sprinkle Land was full of happy fairies, tiny children fairys learning how to fly and collect fairy dust, fully flighted fairys celebrating how much fairy dust they collect during the day at the local bar Tinkle Winkle, fairys walking their dogs down the street and faries down at the local Bubblegum Sprinkle Land enjoying KFC.    This really pissed Firewings off.     Late one night while drinking rum infront of his fire pit,  Firewings thought of an evil plan that would turn Bubblegum Sprinkle Land into chaois and disaster, where the happy, good spirtied fairys would be slaves... 'Bubblegum, woodglue gun, fairy demons of the fairy hell realm, lift your wings, let war begin, all across this crap hole.    With that the fire raged and evil laughter could be heard all across the town. The children ran inside, the adults all went home, fire burnt into the streets, they could sense something bad was happening.    "Never fear my good fairy friends', an angelic looking fairy said  as he was driving in his convertable, 'I know whos behind this and 'I shall save you in time before evil spirits take over our town.'    With a flick of his wand he transported himself to the bee-hive.    'Firewings, I know your behind this, your always trying to ruin our gay little town, just leave us alone'    'Listen here hero, replied Firewings, this is my town I run this b*tch and Imma keep running, ima keep running running never running outta money'.

He also states the pyramid represents a temple as in the days of the Egyptians for the "Masonic God" to come down and rule over the Order.  He misquoted latin and incorrectly placed the meaning of the Pyramid in ancient Egyptian faith.  The Great Seal has been around since 1782 and the dollar bill was changed to its present design in 1932.  Exactly was is the author's definition of "soon"?  The movie "National Treasure"  did not help matters with its fiction.  The Great Seal was developed by 4 different committees from 1776 to 1782 where only one member, Benjamin Franklin, was a Mason.  It was not brought over from Europe by Masons.

UvYzQv5Saa	I don't believe that there is a paradox. Of course you can be a peace lover and in BDSM. BDSM is not about violence: it's about control. And the willingness to give that control over to someone else    but i agree with the other poster, PVC is not eco-friendly.    k|`|695cbbcba51ceed2403cffaf9486d103aa	No, I don't believe that you are on your own and I don't think that your interests are in conflict. If you came to your BDSM Master in anything other than peace, you could put yourself in some danger. A couple of generations ago I was actively involved in various peace campaigns and loved nothing more than being with like minded friends with whom I could relax and be open. It was at this time that I found a new facet of myself in BDSM. I experienced a curious blend of peace and excitement in surrendering to others. In time I became a Master myself and helped others to travel that path. I have no doubt that experiencing both aspects of that world made a positive contribution to my personal development.  I wish you well on your journey.|`|AA11069705	Nah. Nothing wrong with being a freak in the sack. That's just human nature.  Although, PVC isn't really environmentally friendly. So that's sort of a conflict of interest. Maybe you should explore materials of a more organic, and yet similarly elastic, nature.

It says in Mark 15:25 that is was 9am in the morning when Jesus was crucified. Then later on (Mk 15:34) it says that after the sky had turned dark, that Jesus cried out to God saying "My God, My God, why have you abandoned me?" It says that it was 3pm, and then sometime after that Jesus died. Thats like 6 hrs on a cross- i cant even begin to understand that.Thats a huge amount of time.      It doesnt directly say that the 2 criminals died or when they died, but in Luke 23: 42- 43 Jesus says to the criminals that that day they would be with Him in paradise, so that suggests that they would have died. Jesus spoke only the truth so this means that they did die.    Your next point about the broken legs- it doesnt give any direct references in the bible, well in the NCV translation anyways, but i have been told that Jesus' legs weren't broken- im not 100 per on that though. Maybe look in a few different translations.     Also with where Jesus was pierced with a  spear, it doesnt specifically say in the crucifiction  passage, however, when Jesus rises from the dead 3 days later, he says in John 20:27 that he asked Thomas to put his hand in the holes in his hands, and also his side, meaning that he was pierced.     Hope this helped you a bit more :)|`|Vk2zPoqUaa	um... if you didn't read it in the Bible, it's most likely not true.
uAh2rFngaa	Wow! You've only been learning English for 8 months? That's pretty impressive. English is not my first language either, and it took me about 3 years to learn the language while living in the United States. You must be a fast learner ;-) I don't know what your native language is, but mine (Chinese) is also COMPLETELY different from English. It was really really hard for me.    I totally understand what you mean by having to repeat words. Actually, I didn't really want to repeat myself, but people didn't understand me, so I had to repeat myself. I was always really embarrassed too, and felt like such an idiot. This kind of made me not want to talk, and as a result I didn't have any friends at school for two years. Now when I think about it, I really should have talked a bit more.    English is an easy language to learn if you just need to use the basics; however, due to its colloquial/slang nature, it is an extremely dynamic language and is therefore very hard to master. Even though I can pretty much express myself and understand what people are saying by now, I still wouldn't consider myself to be fluent in English. My best advice for you would be to talk to as much people as possible. Since you live in the UK, you probably have a lot of opportunities to do that. You've only been learning English for 8 months so I wouldn't worry too much. You'll be so good one day, I already know it! :-)    And about your last point... I don't know what exactly it is that you are going through, but I totally understand the difficulty of making friends in a foreign country. Seriously, I might have lived here for 6 years but I really still have trouble relating to most Americans. I also consider myself to be an open-minded person, but it seems like I can't really make any really good friend that is natively American--I just can't have "deep" conversations with them, you know? There was also some discrimination problem in my middle school, so that was not good either :-(  btw I live in what is know as "the South" in the U.S., so it is not uncommon to encounter some racist people around.    It really seems like you are a very motivated English learner. I sincerely wish you all the best in learning this language! It's hard, but I promise you that one day you'll look back and be so glad that you had this experience. At first, I hated English, but after I learned English I suddenly fell in love with learning languages ;-) Now I am learning French, and will take Japanese next semester. Good luck!!!|`|hITgLl1maa	hey hun english is not my first language either and it happened to me as well to have to repeat myself at first...the trick is to speak slowly and pronunciate th best that you can. fair play to you, you are doin well!!!

AA11574156	It's nothing, really.

AA10912959	My walk with Jesus and to him is never ending as long as I live in the flesh and on this plane. He wants us to go through these trial that we go through because he wants to see if we can endure all that is being brought to us.    I have been on my walk for 3 years now and I am not going to question God's time because he and only he knows the time and the season that you will gain your harvest.    We all in a large part have to go through it and when you do and you succeed then you will know that you have gained a big victory for you and for the glory of God.    But I want you to know that our walk with Jesus doesn't stop it is continuous and we must do his will if we want our walk to be hard or a soft one. That is pretty much up to us.|`|AA12346188	Never ending.|`|AA10715286	Since I was about 18 years old.  So 6 years.  Just recently though, I have been brought closer and have grown in him so much!

I have learned a great deal about life in general just by attending Bible study, and I understand my reason for being here. Most all of my life's questions have been answered and I live a happy life with my family. Lately I haven't attended Church regularly, I don't know why yet, (but it's not due to questioning my faith) but My answer will come when it's time. I talk with God on a daily basis, he knows my heart. I still consider myself a Baby Christian because there is a lot that I don't know and probably never will. I still cannot quote the Bible. But I am comfortable with where I am right now, and until God tells me otherwise, I will continue with what I am doing.|`|e6240cbb5d544107694fd7e2ebac12caaa	i had the walk with jesus up until 3 years ago, and it was a primative, beautiful psychological game. understanding neroscience and psychology even at an elementary level helps one understand what is really happening in our supposed 'walk with jesus'. i'd suggest doing some reading in those fields. it helps enlighten everyone|`|AA11882225	My walk with God has been 12 yrs..I was delivered..from drugs and wasn't even going to church...God's grace and mercy is everlasting even to a sinner like me......i came out of a mental hospital...from being on drugs...was hearing voice's...was really bad off...when i got out I got back on drugs...dumb uh..but God reached down and delivered me from the junk i had put in my body....not in a church but in my home..wasn't even going to church...didn't even think about God...but he loved me so much....that he took away the desire for drugs...have been clean for 12yrs now...praise God I give Him the glory...not saying my walk has been easy but when I focus on him he helps me Thur the tests..and trials......if i take my eyes off of him...I fall .why its so important to stay in His word...his love letters to us...and to pray...to sit at his feet and listen  ..to always give him the glory..for he has directed my path...God put a song in my heart..and now I sing on the worship team...me get in front of ppl..unheard of before I was saved now its not to the ppl i sing..its for God and to him I lift my heart and voice in praise to Him..and yes i still struggle but i know where my help comes from..from the one that directs my path...don't look to the left or right ..but focus on God..and he will keep my path straight...........

45387fbde26673e289bb751a1b3f8100aa	I was 12 years old at the time. An old babysitter of mine whose sister would have been graduating from college around that time tells me that his sister was not allowed to attend a school in line with her considerable academic abilities (but rather expected to go to a place she could commute to), because they could only afford to send one kid to such a school, and her brother had to take precedence because 'he was going to have to provide for a family someday'.    My parents, on the other hand, were very progressive, and I was carefully taught that although society may expect me to be a weak, submissive housewife and childbearer, the truth of the matter is that the only difference between men and women is their plumbing. In other words, I can do anything I like and gender has nothing to do with it. And indeed, it was possible to do pretty much whatever you wanted, even back then, if you were willing to put enough effort into it.    However, this did represent 'going against the grain'; this sort of thinking about gender - that men are strong, ambitious, career oriented, and women are weak, submissive and destined for homemaking and childbearing - was pervasive enough in society at large that my parents felt the need to take very drastic measures to counteract its influence.    For example, at the age of six, I was caught pretending to feed a baby doll my grandmother had sent for Christmas some time before. The doll disappeared while I wasn't looking - with essentially no explanation. I can surmise that my parents did not want me to succumb to the universal assumption that I would have children someday, just 'because everyone else is doing it'.    My reading matter was also carefully, if discreetly controlled: essentially no fairy tales (i.e. no sleeping princesses waiting to be woken up by the valiant prince), only things like "Madeline", and of course more serious material. Used to read both Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys - they were deemed 'acceptable', as was the TV show based on the books, that I watched as a teenager, along with Battlestar Galactica and sometimes Star Wars).    But such things as news from the major TV networks were not considered acceptable (inappropriate and definitely not impartial presentations of all kinds of things, including gender roles), even if assigned as homework for school. In such a case, my parents required me to, for example, listen to 'All Things Considered' on NPR. And to heck with the teacher's lesson plan...    Later I took to reading such things as science and music textbooks for book reports at school. So much for the idea in society at large that science is not a 'feminine' field. The movement to get girls involved in science started around 1977 or 1978, as I recall, at least where I was (suburbs of major city in the Northeastern US).    It was only really in the early 1980s that this extended to the area of sports, and indeed - at my school then, we had girls playing soccer and running cross-country on boys' teams, and we had a boy playing lacrosse on a girls' team (because there weren't teams of the appropriate gender in those sports).    The boy who played lacrosse went on record that if the coach had required him to wear the skirt that was part of the official uniform, he would have done so without complaint - but he was allowed to wear shorts instead (just had to be the same color as the skirts :> ) By this time I think folks were liberated enough that no one thought he was 'unmasculine'.    However, there was another guy who wanted to play lacrosse, but he was quite large and strong and would have made an excellent goalie - enough so that there would have been mass protests (it was bad enough when they let the one guy play - and he was maybe 5'7"/140 , i.e. not significantly different from the girls in size or weight). The coach decided she'd better not risk taking the other guy as her goalie...    Ah yes, another thing: There was still an idea back then that 'the guy takes the initiative', so that my habit of asking a guy to dance if I felt like it was perhaps not considered *scandalous*, but it was definitely unusual (in other words, no one thought I was a 'loose woman', but I did get some flack for being 'unfeminine'). Perhaps even more unusual was what I did if I did not find a partner - I simply danced by myself. (Most girls would have moped around waiting for someone to ask).    So, I guess you would characterize 1976 and thereabouts as a time of transition: the old ideas were still quite strong, there had not been much large-scale ingress of women into 'traditionally male' fields, or even concerted effort to move young women in such directions, but at the same time, if you were willing to go against the grain, it was possible to make other choices and do other things with your life than what society at large envisioned for you.

71c12f9dadf8fe7858b1386bd9aa637faa	Reformed Christianity is a conservative understanding of the Bible that believes that the Bible is inspired by the Holy Spirit, written without error, and is authoritative today.  Reformed Christianity was developed out of the Protestant Reformation.  The phrase "reformed" Christians simply refers to how these Church figures were "reforming" to what the Bible taught instead of the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church.      The "reformers" emphasized what they called the "five solas."  "Sola" is Latin meaning "Only."  The solas are:    Sola Scripture: Scripture alone is the only inerrant rule of the church's life.    Solus Christus:  Salvation is obtain soley through the work of Christ.    Sola Gratia: We are rescued from God's wrath only by His grace.    Sola Fide:  Our sins are erased only when we have faith in Christ.    Soli Deo Gloria:  Because salvation is of God, and has been accomplished by God, it is for God's glory and we must glorify him alone always.      Church Fathers like Martin Luther (the father of the Reformation), John Calvin, John Wesley, Jonathan Edwards (Popular figure in America's "Great Awakening"), C.S. Lewis (author of Mere Christianity and the Chronicles of Narnia), and even J.R.R. Tolkien (author of Lord of the Rings)  all held to a "reformed" theology.       To be a Reformed Christian simply means that you hold to the historic understanding of God and the Bible.  Reformed Theology is also at times called "Calvinism" after John Calvin who formally developed and wrote out the differences in theology.

But I have seen Shane in other "sexual orientation/gender" roles.  I saw her playing a transexual on Law and Order SVU where she played a transexual.  I have a feeling that she could be a lesbian, but that could be wishful thinking on my part.  I have only been attracted to feminine women, but Shane is hot.  I have to say, Carmine is my type, but I wouldn't kick Shane out of bed.  I think if Shane was a lesbian, I don't understand why she wouldn't come out, she has been in many lesbian themed roles, so I wouldn't think it would hurt her career.  By the way, Brian on QAF is on on a new show that is coming out on fox this fall.|`|AA10950513	I don't think she ever quoted for sure or not but she is really hot...........|`|AA11307156	Jeez, if only it were true......

AA11452268	Well, since you haven't provided the instructions and questions to which these are apparently the answers, it's hard to tell what you were trying to do, but here are a few notes:    "Epouvantable" as a response to "?a va?" seems abrupt. I might go with "Comment ?a va?" and "Pas terrible" or "?a va?" and "Bof! pas tellement" instead.    "Qu'est-ce que tu as?" means "What's wrong?" so your response doesn't make sense. You might try replying, "Je m'ennuie. J'ai un tas de choses  faire ce soir avant de sortir, et j'ai peur de ne pas les finir." Or something like that.    To be honest, I've never seen the word "raplapla" before. If you're sure of your slang source, then fine.    "Weekend" is singular, so you need a singular form of the verb to go with it: "Comment s'est pass ton week-end?"    Other than that, there are a few spelling errors, conjugation errors, accents missing etc, including:  amus(e)   huit heures  de quel quai  co?te  neuf euros  faire de l'arobic  je pars (partir is an irregular verb)

Cain killed his brother Abel in the book of Genesis but there weren't 12 brothers and there is nothing about him being turned black. the decendants of Africa come later in the book from Ham the son of Noah. Ham checks out Noah while he's naked and Noah curses his descendents. the Bible doesn't say anything about being black and I've never heard of any organized crusades against Christians by Muslims. It is believed that many Africans were believers in Christ and that the Ark of the Covenant will resides in east Africa. (I believe the capitla of Ethiopia.)    I'm not relaly sure you're goal with this question but read the book of Genesis more thoroughly for your own first hand Biblical world view.|`|AA12260209	It is true that he was turned black, but I have never heard that africa had crusades against christians.

AA12270622	No, I don't think the world is coming to an end. I would like to take credit for noticing this, but my little old granny actually pointed it out during a family dinner as my father was trying to explain these are "the end times". To quote:    "Oh use your head, Ron! Those are the signs of the apocalypse because they're happening on a constant basis. Of course it seems like the world is going to end. It ALWAYS seems like the world is going to end. People have been saying that since I was a little girl, and it hasn't happened yet. The world's been fixing to come to an end ever since the book of Revelations was written."    And you know, grandma is pretty wise sometimes. It seems much more likely that bad things seem to be happening more often because we hear much more about them than we used to... and in any case, mankind goes through its bad patches.  This isn't the first or the worst, and I'm sure it won't be the last.  =)|`|AA11091977	I'm not religious but I have noticed a lot more bad things happening lately.

I was wondring how you grouped lies in with killing and earthquakes lol.|`|AA10885175	For a quick check, look at the writings of people in history, and realise that we have always thought ourselves on the brink of the end days!    Im sure in London after the Plaque and then the Great Fire, they to thought it was the end of the world as put out in revelations.    Things get worse, they get better, they live, they die.    You can surmise all you want about the end days, but really it doesn't matter, you will never know for sure, and I am certain you will never find out either.    So I agree with the poster above, it just always seems like that!|`|AA11102752	I don't believe in the world ending. But many lives may end because of progression.

Earthquakes are fairly sparse compared to other times in the past.  Lying, killing, think of it per capita:  For every X amount of humans on this planet, X of them is a murderer.  Crime is actually DOWN since the 60s.    Suicide rates are lowest in war-torn countries.  When every day is a struggle for survival, suicide is the last thing on one's mind.  Suicidal depression affects people who live comfortable lives, not those stuggling to survive.    It's not great, and the world still has a lot of problems, but think for a moment what things were like back in the dark ages.

There was once a time, and not a particularly distant time at that, when even our "civilized" world condoned the marriage of extremely young women to extremely old men.    Until recently, people didn't live very long, and if the human race was to survive, women had to be married and impregnated as soon as they were able to be.    By today's standards, this is disgusting, but in that time it was very common all around the world.  Even now, there are countries where the life expectancy is much shorter where women as young as 13 are able to get married.

First of all, more people than just one, two or three should logically have reported. It is strange that no one from Medina, where Hisham ibn `Urwah lived the first 71 years of his life narrated the event, despite the fact that his Medinan pupils included the well-respected Malik ibn Anas. The origins of the report of the narratives of this event are people from Iraq, where Hisham is reported to have shifted after living in Medina for most of his life.     Tehzibul-Tehzib, one of the most well known books on the life and reliability of the narrators of the traditions of the Prophet, reports that according to Yaqub ibn Shaibah: He [Hisham] is highly reliable, his narratives are acceptable, except what he narrated after moving over to Iraq (Tehzibul-tehzib, Ibn Hajar Al-`asqalani, Dar Ihya al-turath al-Islami, 15th century. Vol 11, p. 50).     It further states that Malik ibn Anas objected on those narratives of Hisham which were reported through people in Iraq: I have been told that Malik objected on those narratives of Hisham which were reported through people of Iraq (Tehzib ul-tehzib, Ibn Hajar Al-`asqalani, Dar Ihya al-turath al-Islami, Vol.11, p. 50).     Mizanul-ai`tidal, another book on the life sketches of the narrators of the traditions of the Prophet reports: When he was old, Hishams memory suffered quite badly (Mizanul-ai`tidal, Al-Zahbi, Al-Maktabatul-athriyyah, Sheikhupura, Pakistan, Vol. 4, p. 301).     CONCLUSION: Based on these references, Hishams memory was failing and his narratives while in Iraq were unreliable. So, his narrative of Ayeshas marriage and age are unreliable.     CHRONOLOGY: It is vital also to keep in mind some of the pertinent dates in the history of Islam:     pre-610 CE: Jahiliya (pre-Islamic age) before revelation   610 CE: First revelation   610 CE: AbuBakr accepts Islam   613 CE: Prophet Muhammad begins preaching publicly.   615 CE: Emigration to Abyssinia   616 CE: Umar bin al Khattab accepts Islam   620 CE: Generally accepted betrothal of Ayesha to the Prophet   622 CE: Hijrah (emigation to Yathrib, later renamed Medina)   623/624 CE: Generally accepted year of Ayesha living with the Prophet   EVIDENCE  2: The Betrothal     According to Tabari (also according to Hisham ibn Urwah, Ibn Hunbal and Ibn Sad), Ayesha was betrothed at seven years of age and began to cohabit with the Prophet at the age of nine years.     However, in another work, Al-Tabari says: All four of his [Abu Bakrs] children were born of his two wives during the pre-Islamic period (Tarikhul-umam wal-mamluk, Al-Tabari (died 922), Vol. 4, p. 50, Arabic, Daral-fikr, Beirut, 1979).    If Ayesha was betrothed in 620 CE (at the age of seven) and started to live with the Prophet in 624 CE (at the age of nine), that would indicate that she was born in 613 CE and was nine when she began living with the Prophet. Therefore, based on one account of Al-Tabari, the numbers show that Ayesha must have born in 613 CE, three years after the beginning of revelation (610 CE). Tabari also states that Ayesha was born in the pre-Islamic era (in Jahiliya). If she was born before 610 CE, she would have been at least 14 years old when she began living with the Prophet. Essentially, Tabari contradicts himself.     CONCLUSION: Al-Tabari is unreliable in the matter of determining Ayeshas age.     EVIDENCE   3: The Age of Ayesha in Relation to the Age of Fatima     According to Ibn Hajar, Fatima was born at the time the Ka`bah was rebuilt, when the Prophet was 35 years old... she was five years older that Ayesha (Al-isabah fi tamyizil-sahabah, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Vol. 4, p. 377, Maktabatul-Riyadh al-haditha, al-Riyadh, 1978).     If Ibn Hajars statement is factual, Ayesha was born when the Prophet was 40 years old. If Ayesha was married to the Prophet when he was 52 years old, Ayeshas age at marriage would be 12 years.    CONCLUSION: Ibn Hajar, Tabari an Ibn Hisham and Ibn Humbal contradict each other. So, the marriage of Ayesha at seven years of age is a myth.     EVIDENCE  4: Ayeshas Age in relation to Asmas Age     According to Abdal-Rahman ibn abi zannad: Asma was 10 years older than Ayesha (Siyar A`lamal-nubala, Al-Zahabi, Vol. 2, p. 289, Arabic, Muassasatul-risalah, Beirut, 1992).     According to Ibn Kathir: She [Asma] was elder to her sister [Ayesha] by 10 years (Al-Bidayah wal-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p. 371, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933).    According to Ibn Kathir: She [Asma] saw the killing of her son during that year [73 AH], as we have already mentioned, and five days later she herself died. According to other narratives, she died not after five days but 10 or 20, or a few days over 20, or 100 days later. The most well known narrative is that of 100 days later. At the time of her death, she was 100 years old. (Al-Bidayah wal-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p. 372, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933)     According to Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani: She [Asma] lived a hundred years and died in 73 or 74 AH. (Taqribul-tehzib, Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, p. 654, Arabic, Bab fil-nisa, al-harful-alif, Lucknow).     According to almost all the historians, Asma, the elder sister of Ayesha was 10 years older than Ayesha. If Asma was 100 years old in 73 AH, she should have been 27 or 28 years old at the time of the hijrah.     If Asma was 27 or 28 years old at the time of hijrah, Ayesha should have been 17 or 18 years old. Thus, Ayesha, being 17 or 18 years of at the time of Hijra, she started to cohabit

When sex goes well, it shows in ones life. If it is violent, it shows in ones life. When you are in bed with whomever, may it be the oppisite sex or the same sex, it doesn't matter, because sex is a form of release and taking of energies, you need to know what you are releasing into partner. This also goes with threesomes or more. When you give off violent energies, even though the sex may seem out of this world, phiscally, because it "feels" good, your partner can eventually become emotionally empty. This sex is only superficial. That is fine though. Some people perfer this way. If you prefer this way, by all means follow your heart. But there are some that do not understand this. This is why most would fight. This is why there is so much conflict within the relationship. The release and take are very superficial and empty. Then you have the other side to it. The more profound side to it. This is where one treats the other(s) with utmost respect. This is where each side gives off loving energies. This is where bliss comes in. This is where orgasms come in. It is from the release of energies between the two. More you give off loving energies, not only in bed, but also in life, in a creative manner, things will only get better for the mind just as much as the heart. Hell will arise when things are violent. More and more violent things become, more there is hell. More and more loving things you do, the more heaven is visable. It all determins on how your intentions are towards another. If you control, things will get ugly. If you serve, things will become blissful. Hope that helps.

AA12184855	The world doesn't change when you put sugar on it.    I agree that it isn't fair that a nice person and an ******'s deeds on earth aren't given some final reward or punishment for their time on earth.     However, this has no bearing on whether heaven and hell really exist.  This is a physical reality issue, and physical reality is not dictated by what would be nice or fair.  I am an athiest and believe strongly in the natural construction of the universe, not one designed and controlled consciously from above.     I would rather live in a world knowing there is no god or afterlife than believing in a god that loves me and made the world as a testing ground for my loyalty (which isn't real but makes people feel better about themselves and gives them purpose).       This reward in the 'real world' is accepting that life isn't fair and that nature throws tremendous curveballs to us that are explained with much more complicated logic than the binary religious system (on/off, good/bad/ right/wrong, black/white).|`|AA11932904	You are absolutely right. Otherwise, we are all the same. Even if we apply the moder theories at workplaces; motivation, reward, promotion, demotion, etc, all logic confirm this.

Unfortunately, according to Christianity at least, there is absolutely no correlation between goodness and Heaven or badness and Hell. You can be the meanest, cruelest, most selfish murdering jerk in the world, and so long as you embrace a belief in Christ in your dying moments, you completely avoid all punishment and ascend straight to Heaven. Talk about warped; it's even a sicker theory than saying everyone ends up in a hole in the ground.    Life does make sense in that you get what you give, at least some of the time. If you're a selfish, backstabbing prick, chances are good that eventually you'll end up miserable and alone or surrounded by other selfish, backstabbing prick. If you're kind and charitable, chances are that people will appreciate your kindness and will thank you for it in innumerable ways. But in the end, good behavior is no guarantee of good fortune, and bad behavior is no guarantee of bad fortune. It comes down to a personal decision to either embrace humanity as a whole or not. And although love of humanity doesn't necessarily make you wealthy or famous, it does carry its own reward. And that reward is one that will be inherited by future generations of people who have benefitted from the love you spread; it's not just something you carry with you to the grave.|`|AA11114273	Don't you think it would also be pointless if they went to heaven or hell.

Furthermore, WHY would he make someone, already knowing fully the extent of their righteousness.|`|AA11871016	What if you asked God what you could do for him and his response was:  "Be happy in life."?     Life is what you make of it.  It's worth is for you to judge.    You're telling me the only reason for being "Good" is because some mysterious, unknown punishment might await you at the end?  Perhaps for someone with no conscience and a ridiculously strong sense of self-preservation-which would nullify opportunities for 'bad'(it IS opinion) acts as he'd likely be afraid to leave the house.    Being 'good' has it's own immediate benefits in this lifetime, even for the selfish.      I'm an atheist.|`|AA11446635	Yes I firmly belive that life will be worthless if both good and bad person will end up dead for nothing.    The bible tells us that there is judgement after death.

To me, it makes sense that the soul starts out a bit "blank," or newborn, in the terms of experiences.  As the soul grows and matures, it can sometimes make mistakes, and, like anything else, those actions can become habits in one life.  It takes the next life or maybe a few more for the soul to realize that such things are not the appropriate ways to behave towards others, and in the meantime the soul could be experiencing the same sorts of things to teach them why the suffering of others is bad--it can always happen to you at some point, when you become the weak one.  As the soul that had such a negative past learns and grows, it becomes more open to helping rather than hurting others, which helps it on its way towards maturity.  Eventually, where there are no more flaws for the soul to grow out of, it will leave the cycle of rebirth and join with the Ultimate Power.    To me, that is far more of a worthwhile endeavor for the soul than to become only as good as one lifetime will allow and then just stop growing and learning.|`|AA12264300	Your question should be: "Life wouldn't make sense if there is no CONCEPT of heaven or hell would it now?

AA11350412	Isaiah 22:22    "The key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder: so he shall open, and no one shall shut; and he shall shut, and no one shall open."             Much speculation has come from this passage.Ill briefly examine it using the Bible as its own commentary and see what Isaiah saw.          The key        A key is something that is used to allow entrance; it can also be used to deny entrance. If a father gives his son a key to his house, then he has granted him free access to come in and go out. Our literal understanding of a key helps us to understand this key in Isaiah. Such represents power and authority of various kinds.      The house of David       The house of David refers back to 2 Samuel 7:11-17 where God promises David that He would build David a house (v. 11). This house was not of stone and brick, but was a royal dynasty of kingly descendants. Previously, David wanted to build Jehovah a literal house or temple, but God refused his desire saying that his son would build a house for the Lords name (vv. 1-13). Solomon immediately fulfilled this promise by building a glorious temple of gold, but Jesus ultimately fulfilled it in building the church which is called the house of God in 1 Timothy 3:15. It is also called a temple and dwelling place of God in Ephesians 2:21-22. Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it. . . (Ps. 127:1). To our shame, men who were not content with Gods design, have authored and designed all kinds of churches, but the Lord only built and recognizes one today (Eph. 4:4; 1:22, 23). This church operates within the authority of the New Testament. Jesus is also the fulfillment of God building David an enduring house:     He [Jesus, sjw] will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end (Lk. 1:32, 33; cf. v. 27).    Jesus-The Key Holder    "These things says He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens."  (Rev. 3:7)         Jesus is not only the key to understanding the fulfillment of Old Testament passages like those in this article, but he is also the key to life and godliness. By having the key of David, Jesus has all authority (cf. Matt. 28:18). Jacob observed after his vision of a ladder extending between heaven and earth that,     "This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven!" (Gen. 28:17).     Yet, in the New Testament we see that Jesus is the ladder; He connects earth to heaven and He alone has the key to open that heavenly gate for those who obey Him (Jn. 1:51; Heb. 5:9). This a narrow gate to life(cf. Matt. 7:13), is not found in any other person; therefore, have you been baptized into Christ (Jn. 14:6; Gal. 3:26, 27)? Recall, I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved. . . (Jn. 10:9)?|`|e56a50ad509db353bf37af6222663eb4aa	What? What kind of question is that? You mean the seat of David, the throne of David? The sceptre shall not depart from Judah? (Genesis 49, I think).|`|AA10878214	Key of David...in my mind refers to Jesus....who comes from the line of David.
AA11016135	About four years ago, I purchased a laptop computer online using my credit card with Bestbuy.com.  The laptop cost approximately $1,000.  Upon receiving the laptop, I discovered it did not have a feature that I understood it was to have.      So I returned the laptop to Bestbuy.com.  They refunded my credit card in full.  Then a short time later they refunded my credit card a second time.  WOW an extra $1,000.  But values and a conscience would not allow me to keep the funds.  I made contact with BestBuy.  Actually I contacted them three times before they actually accepted the refund back.    Some folk thought "their loss, your gain."  For myself I would have lost my sense of integrity knowing the money was not mine.  I believe values with an attitude of simplicty still have an impact on the world in which we live.|`|AA11362219	I sold something on eBay and the person sent me more money than they needed to.

I had trouble paying bills, even trouble buying food.  One night a week or so from Christmas, I went to a Walmart to pick up some bread, when I found a purse abandoned in the parking lot.  Inside it was almost $1,000 in cash.    I waited for awhile, and no one came looking for it.  I debated for quite awhile on what to do with it.  Bring the whole thing inside and turn it in?  Leave the purse, keep the money?  Take the whole thing?  I could have paid the bills I needed to, and still had enough to purchase small gifts for my family.    I couldn't do it, though, much as I was tempted to.  I put everything back and brought it inside.  It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one.

When Christ returns it will be as righteous judge  in full authority and power of His Father.  Rejecting Christ now you leave Him no choice but to judge you when He returns. there is a lot more of what is going to happen but you can read it for yourself, Rev.21    Math.26:64 Jesus replied, "Yes, it is as you say. And in the future you will see me, the Son of Man, sitting at God's right hand in the place of power and coming back on the clouds of heaven."    Rev 1:7,8 Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen.   "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," says the Lord, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."   Rev 6:14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. .......Messenger|`|AA11528101	He will return the same way he left, taken up into the clouds.  This will be done in front of all the people that live in and around Jerusalem today.    As to whom he will save? No one. He is a man, a messenger, who gave a message 2000 years ago and only a few listened. When he returns, his mission will be to deliever a new message from God, God's Wrath upon all the people on the earth,  Why Wrath? For forsaking His Torah, ignoring or even twisting the messages of His servants, living in a direction that he did not ordain. And while Jesus wont be happy about giving this message, he'll deliver it anyway.    The only people God will save from this Wrath would be those who obey His commandments and keep the witness of His prophets, even Jesus.    So everyone who breaks God's commandments can expect to face God's Wrath.    So the next question should be - what are God's commandments.|`|AA10848331	He will return in his big boomerang shaped spacecraft with white horses logo on the front, he will save all good looking people who have had no plastic surgery, the ugly and infirm and plastic will be left to face the final tribulation and total destruction.

AA10702875	I doubt a Buddhist has ever killed someone for not believing in Buddhism.  In fact, throughout its history, Buddhism has been continuely threatened by the fact that its members refuse to go out and convert others.|`|AA12357988	I don't know this to be fact, but I'll bet there's never been a Buddhist kill someone over religion.|`|AA10867743	No what kind of world do you think we live in?? Religion is one of the biggest subjects in the world. Of course all religions have been persecuted ecspecially Muslims, Christians, and escspecially Jews they have been perscuted for centuries.|`|AA10504017	nope.  religion is like tribalism, death is part of the territory|`|0b6a73d0f8474b426272496fcf46861daa	Certainly.  I am a Quaker, part of the tradition of Peace churches that arose in England in the 1600s.  We believe that there is that of the Light or God in each human.  It is a challenging belief.|`|AA11801562	Yes, most religion has started that way... but you have to look past what you read today, and look at the actions of the people...    Christainity started off as a people so peaceful that they wouldn't even kill to defend themselves (keep in mind that they where feed to the lions by the Romains) but they eventually had the Crusaides..... I think its more of the mans will to empower that we see today... The word of god is one of love. Not of hate and killing. But its man that has used it to do just that... and its the blind following (taking what others tell you without researching the answer also for yourself) that leads anyone to believe that it was any different.    And actually Islam has the most peaceful version that I know of. According to the Quran they believe that you really shouldn't even go as far as to try to change a persons religion, and that threw your actions they will follow the teachings of Mohomid.  Although I still think that somewhere along the way they have even forgotten that peaceful side. I mean most think that they hate christains... But inthe Quran, Christains are refered to as people of the good book... Go figure.|`|AA10505609	I'm not sure such exists, because many people make mistakes, unfortunately,and do not adhere to what they are taught.|`|AA11142539	well, there's scientology, if religion created by a sci-fi writer counts...    ...there's atheism, I think atheists have little motivation to save those poor deluded christian's souls... but some would argue that atheism is not a religion.    Then there's the religion I usually find in the middle of a big bowel movement... you know, the bright lights, the choir of angels... Don't think anyone's died from that, unless they were too close to the bathroom.  :)|`|AA10600969	I don't believe the Puritans ever killed anyone, just severely frowned upon people who weren't Puritanical.

AA11094683	Consider this:  Most people go to church on Sunday when the commandments say the sabbath is on the seventh day of the week, which is, and always has been, Saturday.  How about not making graven images?  How many pictures and statues of Jesus are out there?  Then we have the "shall not covets", and who can honestly say they have not yearned for something someone else has?  And lastly, lets go one step further when it says later in the bible that the thought is as good as the deed.  I'd say at least 80% of the population has broken every one of them when you toss that into the equation.|`|AA11713632	To some, good means without sin. To others, it simply means you have good qualities. I believe the latter. Even though I sometimes break the 10 commandments, I still consider myself a good person.|`|AA12346961	Nope.

I clean my conscience regularly and I can honestly that yes I am a good person.|`|AA11472742	Jesus clearly said that there is none good other than the father.

Some historians say that the Romans left the posts and trees they used for crucifixion in place.  Only the crosspiece was carried by the condemned man.

I'm a pure Christian and proud to admit it to anyone in the world!  Well, my answer for your question is this:  The world will end as we know it, like the world began.|`|AA10848331	Read some real books and get your head out of your butt...kay!|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	Stop worrying about the end of the world.

It is useless to constantly think of how you are going to die when you could be deciding on how to live your life in a way that pleases you, not how it pleases a god.|`|AA11524718	it means that the world with its dark age ideas will change and accept higher learning and higher spiritual growth instead of religious dogma and doctorine    what has really spoiled mankind is the belief that we are all damned at birth and need someone to pull us out of a mudhole we ourselves mentally created. we save ourselves. its a concept that christians hate but its the honest brutal truth and if you dont like it stick it up your butt.

I was taught that our world is going to end, like in the days of Noah. But I also think that there WILL be another Eden.|`|AA11500911	It means that the world is constantly evolving and changing, and if people dont accept it they will be destroyed by the Creator, who does not like the Puritian mindsets of Christians and the barabarianism of Muslims|`|AA10842760	I take the apocalypse so personally, that I don't care about the 5 or 6 billion people that will die. That's why I think the book of Revelation, is about my death, me.    It has nothing to do with the wars in the middle east, or earthquakes that kill many. Those are reminders, to me, that I'm going to die. And the world "as I know it", will be over, forgotten, done.    My fondest wish, is to wake, seemingly an instant later, with a man in white to meet me. The world, and the time that passed while I was 'dead', will seem meaningless to me.    A personal relationship with your savior, can be a very selfish endeavore.|`|AA11620687	At the second coming of Jesus, The world, the universe, and time will come to an end. Heaven and Hell is all that will be left.|`|AA10824280	In the Bible the word "world" has different meanings.Sometimes the world means the earth(Acts 17:24) At other times it can mean mankind (John 1:2)  Psalms 37:29 promises that the righteous will possess the earth and live on it FOREVER.  Rev.11:18 tells us Jah will bring to a ruin those ruining the earth.  So from the Bible we see that when the destruction of the world is mentioned it doesn't mean the physical earth.  Once we start taking in accurate knowledge of Jehovah the Bible becomes less complicated and more enlightening.  Enlighten yourself!|`|AA11547521	It means that the things that are worldly, not the earth.|`|a7330c6946822138b5bb8f9cfeae6a90aa	it means that we know the end of the world is going to happen... but we won't know when.

Then Jesus will judge the people of the world.Those that accept Jesus to heaven.Those who rejeect Jesus to the lake of fire prepared for the devil and his demons(and those who opposed,rejected Jesus,and choose hell).|`|AA10047634	No more greedy politicians, squirrley actors, crazy Arabs, Big Oil, etc. The system of things will end, to be replaced by an honest government administered by God Himself.|`|AA10637643	That one day the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisical glory.
AA11686559	The birth of Jesus himself comes from mythology. People are crazy if they think Jesus was the first "God" born to a human virgin mother.  The Romans at the time still believed in multiple Gods and such mythology as virgin births.  The Jews that followed Jesus at the time never believed in his divinity. They called him "messiah", which literally translates to "teacher". The Romans are the ones that made Jesus's birth divine. Since the books of the bible weren't even compiled until the year 200 AD or so, that got incorporated.|`|AA10789965	it would appear that some angels had intercourse with humans..male and female..that is why sodom and gommorah had to be destroyed..that was not meant to be because you had species with different spiritual makeup resulting in giants..check goliath..he was a cross breed..|`|AA11408134	"Is" is spelt with an "i" and "s", not an "a", "n" or "d".    The ten commandments myth is a copy of the Code of Hammurabi, both in "rules" and how "god gave it to mankind".    The moses biography is a copycat of Ramses' biography.    The jews were never in Egypt, archologists have confirmed that.    The jeebus myth is a copy of the Mithras fable.      In fact, every single fable and construct in the bible traces itself back to a pre-existing religion.  There is nothing original in a cult created by committee.  The catholic church (and all christianity) was as invented as scientology was, to bilk money out of people they can fool into believing it.|`|AA12259797	Book of Enoch....look it up|`|AA12310339	I think you know the answer.    the epic of Gilgamesh is but one of the sources for some of the Biblical fables...     The recurrng  12     Virgin Births     The Son of God and The Sun God.    Resurections...etc etc           on and on.|`|AA11114670	Very religious people may not like to admit it, but it's painfully obvious that much of the bible has striking similarities to various mythological stories that were written before the bible.|`|AA10842760	In the mythologies I've read, giants usually symbolize cultures. Goliath was a giant, and stood for the Philistines. When he lost, they lost. Paul Bunyan was a giant, and symbolized ambition. He ran out of trees, at the same time Americans abondoned Manifest Destiny. The gospel can be translated into any culture, any language, for any people. The Fundamental Truths are Universal, and ancient.|`|AA11322853	i was told that angels came to earth and mated with humans, creating a super sub-speciese.|`|AA12073465	Sons of God just means men. Not aliens or anything. So the men laid with daughters of men and had children. Nothing weird.|`|AA11851885	they were extremely large humans who bullied other humans, that's it, also the benjaminites were extremely large with six fingers and toes on each hand and foot, look it up it's history.|`|AA11547521	Men are also considered when they are righteous to be sons of God so when it says that the Sons of God  had intercourse with the Daughters of men it is literally means that Righteous Men had intercourse with Wicked women.

AA12065442	May be this is the time to reform Islam, exactly like what Christianity and Jaudism did long time ago.|`|54e01c7e24521ded6a8d07684ab8427faa	First you have to loose your stereotypes about it to really find out why people are muslim.|`|1ebe60a990af19233aab991f70966e2baa	Stop stereotyping people.|`|2785a4556ed7d17f1e8b1a29f0736443aa	Have you ever come across a normal muslim? think outside the box.|`|AA10158490	Islam is the only religion that can prove itself, through science, the Bible, the Torah, Induism, philisophy and many other means.  Scientifically, every thing is based on cause and effect thus materialism must go to a beginning.  If you believe that materialism does not have a beginning, then you must believe it is eternal, and any thing eternal is perfect b/c it does not require change thus if it is perfect, it must have had a Originator to move it towards change.  You can call this a higher Intelligence or God.  As human kind matured, so did his capacity to understand knowledge so religions came with that capacity, until Islam came with its perfect system.  Like a child would not enter algebra, he must first understand simple math, so did man kind understand the basics of humanity and within these previous levels of knowledge there are clues of Islam/Muhammad. ~in genesis it says of the seed of Ishmael I will create a great nation and through him I shall give 12 princes~ just one clue in thousands.  Prophet Muhammad (SAW) was the only one to claim himself from Ishmael and he had 12 descendants, all young leaders of the community in Shia Islam.  Plus the Bible says false prophets will not success but Islam will be the largest religion in the world in the not so far future.  In Hinduism it talks of a man by the name of Muhammad who will rise from Mount Paran (Arabia) who is the Final Prophet.  Jesus also says in the Bible that if he does not go, then the Parcliytis will not come (Ahmad), this is controvercial b/c what is typed in American/European Bibles is different than what is writtin in the original Aramiac which is the meaning of Ahmad (short for Muhammad).  And you can search Yahoo! for more prophesies with more detail and refences.  You should study the life of Saul who introduced the concept of son of God from Zeus son of Apollo, who later changed his name to St. Paul.|`|AA12323504	This is just a stupid non-question.|`|AA12307311	foolish non question|`|AA12328826	Good question. Not a non-question at all.     Its men who like to convert to Islam more than women. It suits them best. Can have many wives. Can raise innumerable kids as contraceptives are not allowed in Islam. Can keep his beautiful wife behind a black cloth while he ogles at every passing woman. Best of al, he gets to tell his wife/ -ves that he is the master.    No one converts to Islam for the good that the book reveals. They convert for all this alone.     All religions propogate the same message. So it doesnt make meaning to convert. Ofcourse if you are born a muslim, you have no redemption.|`|AA11368434	Do you remember what the Pope did to his turkish muslim shooter by the name of Ali Acga?

AA00000228	I think the principle is to give 10% of your income to God. Whether you give to church or to charity is a matter of conscience, but it's the principle that matters.|`|AA12344459	How are you helping Christianity's plans to convert the world if you don't give them money?|`|AA11350412	poor.. yes  hunrgy... sort of  can i have money now?|`|AA10162493	Somewhat, yes.  One of the reasons God asks us to give money to the church is so that we learn to give to God what is his and relinquish all rights to it.  If we give to charities and things of our own choosing, we're still in control of the money.  If we give to our church, we are giving it to God and saying: This is your money, so here is some back.  Do what you want with it; I let go of all rights.    It's harder to do and also demonstrates a greater commitment to God and helps to keep our hearts in the kingdom of God rather than in this world.|`|7c577672dcd5175b337c5f0f61ecb29baa	God judges the condition of the heart.How ever the church is the   representation or the place of his people.If you do your home work you will find a number of 23 to 28% the remaining amount  was given or spread between leaving the corners of your fields   for those that pass by in secret and the other is where you put your hand in your pocket and give what ever is in it.The condition of your heart should be dont let the left hand know what the right hand is doing.All of these can be looked up in both the old and the new testament.|`|2bdce040d9b51013789ad55f4fb9a907aa	I can speak a lot on tithing because I know the benefits of it and have been tithing for nearly a decade now.    Here's my thing:  if you are Christian, you should tithe to your church.    If you are not a Christian, then PICK SOMETHING and TITHE TO THAT!!!  No, seriously!      Listen, here's some of the benefits of tithing outside of the scripture:  1)  It teaches you that there is more than enough  2)  causes that you believe in are advanced  3)  you learn to budget your finances much more effectively  4)  it puts you in control of money rather than money in control of you  5)  It comes back to you by improving your community by that measure and then some  6)  Other people and organizations can benefit from your gift  7)  You experience the joy of giving  8)  It can promote you as a philanthropist in the marketplace  9)  you gain influence through other people  10)  you make new contacts in the marketplace    There's ten reasons for an athiest to give money to some cause:  United Way, Red Cross, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Democrats, Republicans, NAACP, NOW, ACLU, ACLJ, whatever!|`|AA12220467	No, I think you're a smarter and a more moral person for doing that.|`|AA11895160	thats what that means the bible does not say give to a church,it said a tenth holy unto GOD,not a building.i feel that  giving to a charity is giving to GOD,and it wouldnt bother me one bit about it|`|AA11985799	I don't think you are wrong for feeling this way but, the Bible says that 10% goes to him (his people).    Often nowadays (I know in my church anyway),  churches sponsor things like that. When you give your 10% you specify what missions you want them to be sent to. Don't forget that your money does also help pay your pastor's salary.    Also, if you think about it, when you give your money to the church, you are, in a way, helping people. What about the lost in Christ. Our pastors are there to teach us (and non-believers) the love of Christ. And THAT is supposed to be our main mission in life.|`|AA10268547	Most churches do alot of good, and normally if you merley give money to the poor on the street, they buy drugs or booze with it,  Though proper charities, they control how it is used.|`|AA11926989	churches have enough money. most of them keep it for themselves anyway. for the church that is. the true temple is the body. going to church is just getting told how to believe. we already know. give it to people that really need it, instead of some place that gonna buy a plasma tv for it's theatre room or something.    definitely not people on the street.. they need HELP, not direct handouts.|`|AA10915524	The  bible  said (malachi 3:10)"Bring   your whole tithe into  the  storehouse,that  there may  be food in my  house..."God  commands us to  give  our tithes or 10% of our income into  the  church  that we   belong  to..we  should  obey  what  god  commands us,,helping  others is  part  of our good  works.|`|AA11740824	Honey God will ALWAYS let you know if what you're doing is WRONG. When I attended church (seldom go now) I frequently gave my tithe money to the less fortunate. Or if I felt they would be uncomfortable with accepting money I went out and bought them bags of groceries or gave them gift certificates to get the things they may need the most. Items that I may not be aware of such as baby formula, over the counter medicine etc.... It sounds like you're a caring person. The world needs more like you.|`|AA12221497	if you have done it to one of the least of these, you have done it to me.|`|AA12282609	No you are not wrong---that is precisely where tithes are supposed to be placed...|`|e7a15e517271ec518c7193c906f3de30aa	First of the tithe was an Old Testament requirement.  No where in the New Testament is there a requirement for Christians to tithe.  Christians are suppose to give not knowing what the left hand is doing.  We are to give because it gives glory to God and because we want to do it. To many churches today demand a tithe or lay a guilt trip on people to give a tithe of their gross wages which can actually hurt a poor family trying to make ends meet.  Christ even talked about that when he sited the temple officials demanding money from worshipers "Corban", a gift to God, instead of allowing that money to support the father and mother in old age.  Breaking the fourth commandment to honor your father and mother.    But to your question yes it is just as proper to give your money where it can be used for the best outcome.  It is actually  your duty to do so since you are to be a steward of your resources.

In books of today, there wouldn't be laws about running red lights if no one were running red lights!|`|AA00000228	It's a matter of what's appropriate. We should not kill, but certain offenses are worthy of death. It's just like in our society, we value freedom, but that sometimes requires putting people in jail to protect it.  How can we value freedom and put people in jail?  But it makes sense.    For the record, there is no opposing idea to "spare the rod and spoil the child" in Scripture. It's pretty consistent about parental discipline being a good thing.|`|2248d12e9a787a2471de981f2b154353aa	Maybe you should check up on those "contradictions." Sometimes the Bible has a different meaning than you think it does. If you read up on your "contradictions" you may find a good explanation.|`|44eadcb78363e74a10b53654bad92e02aa	1. Thou shalt not murder. Period. You can BE killed as a punishment for murder if found guilty and you do not ask for sanctuary ( usually it was a town or building (like jail)). You had to stay in sanctuary for a prescribed number of years to be absolved of your crime. If you left too soon (or didn't go), you could be killed by a friend or relative of the victim in the name of justice.    2. If you are reading the Bible in English, French, Italian, Spanish, etc....you are not reading God's words as these languages are "lay" languages. (and there was a big-to-do when the Bible was translated into them...still is) Even Latin is not it's original language. And since it has passed through a number of lands and been written originally or translated into so many different languages, the idea that the Word is still pure is silly.    God is infallible, Man needs Spell check|`|AA11584516	What's with the taking the "o" out, does the "o" have some kind of power, does taking the "o" out of God take away the power of the word or are people afraid of God or of the word GOD? This doesn't make sense to me and yes the Bible does sometimes contradict itself, but some people have made an art out of explaining this away. I'm sure you'll get many fine answers from those people.|`|AA12220467	It's a badly written book that's full of contradictions. It's not the word of god, it's the word of the people that wrote it.

It really says (in Hebrew): Thou shalt not murder.    Thou shalt not kill is too generic, and of course unavoidable.  There were times when killing was necessary, but unprovoked *murder* was not acceptable.  Big difference.    There are no real contradictions, only verses that have been misinterpreted and/or mistranslated, and verses that have been taken out of their Biblical context and/or cultural context. =)|`|AA11116604	OT, just parables or metaphors, should not be taken lithely|`|3ad354141fba18411a3f0a255bd3d708aa	True, there are some "problematic" passages in the Bible - you have to take into account that it's a written account of many things that occur ed over THOUSANDS of years.     My best advice - open it up and dig in - really dig in and study.  The odds are, you will encounter God and his "word".|`|6eda803368297c03eda54d18ea7d096caa	G-d's word is G-d's word.  I believe every word of it.  Take a closer look and study the passages again with the context in consideration.      No, there is no opposite to spare the rod and spoil the child.  It's true too.    Thou shalt not kill is one of our commandments.  He ordered people to be killed in holy battles, but on a day to day individual basis we are not suppose to kill.    Old testament is old covenant and new testament is new conventant.    hope this helps...dig a little deeper    God Bless....|`|AA10689754	Dear:Lilmiss You have to take your time reading the HOLY BIBLE  you have to ask the HOLY SPIRIT to guide you,it is his understanding that we are to follow and not ours.There has to be order or else there would be CHAOS.WE SERVE AN ORDERLY GOD,LET THE HOLY SPIRIT GUIDE YOU,AND GOD BLESS|`|AA10074301	Spelling the name of G-d in that manner actually shows respect for those whom you have been around and I applaud you for it.

The Bible in its current form has been translated so many times, so it's very possible that it could have been changed or mistranslated. There are lessons that are in there that I believe that God could have passed down, but I believe that humans could have perverted that message to justify their own hatred and misery.|`|df42917121b50fb75ae48226bfdfa031aa	Ploooffoooo! Schmooofloouuaa!    TRANSLATION:  Hello there, I'm Sampson the Elephant.    According to true Christian/Jewish tradition, only the laws set down by Moses and the voice of Jesus are the words of God. The rest of the Bible is actually witness to the word of God, and to the history of God's chosen people. The Quran, on the other hand, is respected by Muslims as the exact word of God as translated by Muhammad.     This translation brought to you by the GOP. That's the GOP-- fighting terrorists since we funded their training camps to fight the SU in the early '90s.|`|AA11371978	i am not sure about the 'spare the rod and spoil the child' thhing but i belive that the best verse to put with 'thou salt not kill' is the verse that states 'an eye for an eye'|`|AA11247030	Because it isn't god's word. It was written, and re-written, and re-written by man.|`|e56bcdcde8b59c0610e6658e3d2f4b80aa	The answer is that the bible is not God's word.  It was created by, edited, translated, altered and influenced by PEOPLE.    The original version was highly unlikey to have expressed God's will, and since then the book has been twisted by numerous political and religious powers. As a result, we're left with a document that is filled with contradictions and inconsistancies.    Don't get me wrong.  I don't mean to marginalize people's faith, but if you are seeking devine verities you should seek them out in the real world and not inside this book.|`|a6452e49bde556148e84894d65ed147faa	Yes, it is Gods word.....All the writers wrote with the Holy Spirit in them, making the Holy Spirit the author. 2 Tim 3:15-16...

It does, however, show a lack of instruction, learning, and understanding. In other words, you are ignorant. Being ignorant isn't so bad, as long as one does not stay ignorant.     The bible is the revealed word and will of God. In its original form, there are no inaccuracies, contradictions, or errors, of any kind. Any apparent contradiction is either in ones understanding or in the translation. For the believing believer, the bible has answers, power, truth, and certainty. For the unbeliever, it only has riddles and confusion.    Proverbs 25:2  It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.    1 Corinthians 2:14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.       Let's address your two situations given here. First of all, God does not kill. The devil has the power of death (Heb.2:14). Secondly, 'spare the rod and spoil the child', is not scripture!

Then the straight man became a Christian. When his friend learned about it, he was concerned and asked, "Now that you are a Christian, will you still love me?" Isn't that a tragic question? What did this man think about Christians that made him ask that? The Christian has a love that transcends anything known by the world, doesn't he/she? Yet how many Christians would desert such a friendship? Christians! Jesus' love included; our lack of love excludes.

AA12180074	Those that have no religion will be saved from the bombardment of those having religions...  We will be secure in not having to cater to their bully pulpits.|`|AA10883660	The Bible speaks of two groups of people.  The "little flock" which number 144,000.These ones are called up to heaven to rule as kings and priests with Jesus.The ingathering of these spirit annointed ones began in the upper room on Pentecost 33CE.This number is pretty much now sealed,and there are approx some 8000 remaining on the earth today.Those remaining at Armageddon will be taken to heaven "in a   twinkling of any eye".  Rev.14:1-4;1Cor.15:52;Luke 12:32  The other group mentioned in the Bible are referred to as  "the great crowd" or "other sheep"  These are the ones that will reside on the earth after Armageddon.Jehovah God will also resurrect the dead,so they too will have an opportunity to decide whether or not they will search God and have the opportunity to live   forever.  However, to be counted amongst those Jehovah finds worthy require not only having faith in Him and His only begotten Son,Jesus Christ,but exercising that faith,by being obedient to Jesus' command found at Matt.28:19,20  And only then can we hope to survive the coming destruction of this system of things,but we must also "endure to the end"-Matt.24:13.  Matt.24:14;Rev.7:9;John 10:16;Ps.37:9-11,29;Pr.2:21  If you feel you would like more information about the last days and what you can do to be amongst those saved,go to your local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses,who would be only too happy to provide you with any answers you need.Also they could conduct a free home bible studly with you,if you so desired.|`|AA11588942	Only those who obey God's commands.

In the tribulation the people who turn to God and follow Him will be saved (though most will physically die).|`|AA10025366	Most of the answers here are correct.  "Saved" means a person who has accepted Jesus Christ as their savior.  As Jesus said, unless a man be born again, he will not enter the kingdom of heaven.  Born again means, born of the spirit, which comes from repentance of sin and faith in the blood of Christ, which washes that sin clean and makes us a "new creation".    After the rapture, those still living on earth will be saved exactly the same way; they will have to put their faith in Christ.  One caveat; during the tribulation period, people will not be able to buy or sell anything without a "mark" on their forehead or hand.  This is referred to as the mark of the beast.  Anyone having taken this mark will not gain entrance to heaven.    Much better to bow our knees to Jesus now....that is why the bible counsels, "today is the day of salvation".|`|AA10153636	The ones that always will be saved are the born again christians, and they already know who they are..|`|AA11539850	the 144,000 has nothing to do with being saved the 144,000 is the number sealed(locked away) to be unlocked during a certain time.|`|AA11432411	The Christians basiclly|`|AA12148880	Those who have fallen asleep in Christ, Jesus or who died waiting for a savior.

It happened already during the Roman empire during the persecution of the seven churches representing seven candles. In order to buy  in the market place you had to see the temple priest. If you worshiped false gods they would give you a number refered to as 666, the mark of Roman emperor. The Kingdom has already come. The kingdom is the Church. That is why in Matthew 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.   Mat 16:19  And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  Peter preached the first sermon to the future Church on the Day of Pentcost Acts 2.     What If The Lord Were To Come Right Now? Would You Know For Sure, Without A Doubt, That You Would Go Heaven?     May I tell you my story?    My story relates to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.    Who is this Jesus?    We can know how to have eternal life!  1 John 5:13 These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, [even] unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God.     There was a time in my life when I was confused, because of all the different churches out there. Which one do I believe, because they all teach different things?    Just because I was raised by my parents to believe certain things does that make everyone else wrong? No.  I got to thinking in life there are life and death statements.  For instance let's say your house catches on fire. Someone comes up in the middle of the night and raps on the window and shouts "get out of the house, the house is on fire." Well you know you wouldn't need an interpreter or call a few friends over and ask them what it means when someone says your house is on fire. No you wouldn't do that it is so clear what you should do. You understand you simply have to act on it and get out of the house. Well I got to thinking the Bible talks about there being an everlasting punishment. I believe this is Gods word. I thought God must have some life and death statements. Like get out of the house the house is on fire. Does God have some statements like believe this and you will live do this and you will die? He does.     Then, what has been written?     John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.    Well I know what that means. Unless I believe that Jesus is who he says he is I will die in my sins.    Isn't this a life and death statement?    Then who is this Jesus?     Let's go exploring.     Matthew 16:13-17 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is? 14 And they said, Some [say] John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. 15 He saith unto them, But who say ye that I am? 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.     Whose son is he? "God's son"  In other words Jesus says you are right.    Well you know I got to thinking what does it mean to believe he is the son of God? So I kept reading.    Is he being the son of God all we must believe concerning His identity?     John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    And I kept reading.       Just being the son of God...Is God. Notice here:   John 1:14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.     Well here Jesus is claiming to be the son of God and God at the same time.     All Jesus is saying is that he is the same as his parents. Jesus mother was human and father was God. That makes him 100% human and 100% God.    Is that important that Jesus is a 100% God and man? Remember John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.    When Jesus came to earth, did he leave his Godhead in Heaven?     Colossians 2:9 for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,   Notice that Jesus is 100% man and 100% God.      Here God the Father calls his own son God.    Hebrews 1:1, 8 God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,   8 but of the Son [he saith], Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.     Quote above taken from Psalm 45:6    I remember back when God was talking to Moses through the burning bush in Exodus 3:14-15 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.     I noticed Jesus using that same name.     Who does Jesus claim to be?      Jesus claims to be the great "I Am"    John 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.     I remebered John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I|`|AA11925800	the ones that are saved whn the rapture occurs|`|AA11991107	the ones that believe Jesus is the son of God  and that he is Lord|`|eecdb006defd07760d4563a90b2fda87aa	In my opinion, the ones that will be saved are the ones that lived a clean life and uphold the laws of God. whatever he/she conceives God to be,just as long as you are sincere in your worship.  the Ten commandments is a good set of rules to follow.

AA11016135	The Church of the Nazarene is a missional Church in just over 150 worlds areas.  The key message is the Spirit-filled life in Christ with a focus on holiness.  The Church engages wholeheartely in compassionate ministry around the world.    The denomination as a whole is about a hundred years old.  Some of the key roots of Church influence come from John Wesley and the Methodist movement (1700's) within the Anglican Church of England.    Agreed Statement of Belief    These are the beliefs Nazarenes hold to be true:    We believe in one God-the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.    We believe that the Old and New Testament Scriptures, given by plenary inspiration, contain all truth necessary to faith and Christian living.    We believe that man is born with a fallen nature, and is, therefore, inclined to evil, and that continually.    We believe that the finally impenitent are hopelessly and eternally lost.    We believe that the atonement through Jesus Christ is for the whole human race; and that whosoever repents and believes on the Lord Jesus Christ is justified and regenerated and saved from the dominion of sin.    We believe that believers are to be sanctified wholly, subsequent to regeneration, through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.    We believe that the Holy Spirit bears witness to the new birth, and also to the entire sanctification of believers.    We believe that our Lord will return, the dead will be raised, and the final judgment will take place.     History:  http://www.nazarene.org/welcome/history....

Si tienes hermanos, te pregunto, ?cuando le dijeron ellos a tus papas "Soy heterosexual".?   Lo importante es que aqu lo que es tu vida intima quede como tal, si tu manearamos, relaciones personales o gustos por vestir, son demasiado obvios es preferible hablar con ellos para evitar sorpresas inesperadas.   No mientas cuando te preguntes con quien sales, ni digas que tienes novia llamada Carla cuando realmente es un novio de nombre Carlos, pues mentir y luego decir soy gay implica enga?o con dolo y adems creaste falsas expectativas.

God realized that man could never live up to his expectations.  Even though God created man 'In His image' men are sinners and we can't always stay on 'The Path'    This is why God came here as/sent Jesus.  To give men - who are naturally prone to things like greed, jealousy and hate - an avenue of forgiveness that would eliminate God's wrath on man.    God just wanted his people to be good and holy.  Just like the rest of us, learning things takes time - even for God.  Creating His image in the flesh essentially didn't work out quite like he planned.  The flesh, the spirit and the mind are not things that God has to deal with personally.  He didn't realize until after the creation what the full ramifications of injecting spirit into flesh would be.    think about it.  we are created in His image.  but He has no flesh.  creates all sorts of unforseen problems.  plus, human nature is slightly rebellious... lol...|`|AA11452268	Yes, I know what it says. Leviticus one of the most disturbing works ever to be passed off as a moral code known to man. In it, God sounds like nothing so much as a deranged sociopath. He threatens to kill any priest who dares to remove his hat within the tabernacle or exit the tabernacle with oil upon him, as well as any child that curses at his mother or father, or anyone who has homosexual sex, or anyone who commits adultery. And incidentally, if you divorce and remarry, isn't that adultery? Hmm...I wonder why the Christians who cite Leviticus to condemn homosexuality aren't in quite as much of a hurry to condemn people who remarry and commit adulterous sex? Anyone else smell the hypocrisy?    God also says in Leviticus that we should not eat shrimp, clams, eagles, hawks, or four-legged insects (except locusts and grashoppers) because they are an "abomination". Makes me wonder why he created them in the first place if he thought they were so abominable. Of course, "abomination" is also the word used to describe homosexuality and beastiality. So apparently eating oysters is as evil as sodomizing your neighbor or your dog. Go figure.    As for those who say that Leviticus no longer matters because God finally figured out that men were sinful and yielded to the temptations of the flesh and therefore gave us Jesus to save us, thus negating the rules he made in the Old Testament, I have only one question: What took him so long to figure it out?|`|AA11391096	You just got the frame, you didn't get the whole picture!...you can't kick around scriptures and make it say what you want it to say to justify your wrong doings!....if you would read the entire Bible you would also see GOD"S JUDGMENTS on these Acts!....and if you're going to quote scriptures from the Bible, you'd better be able to live what you preach to others otherwise, you would be labled as a hypocrite & heretic!.........ps did you by any chance notice while reading the (Bible) anything concerning Salvation, Deliverance, Holy Spirit, Heaven, & Hell!...........guess not!

AA11277067	They probably belongs to one of these cults that deny the trinity. But     YES, it is in the Old Testament. Genesis 1:1: In the beginning, Elohim created. That is not Yahweh, Elohim is a plurality, meaning more than one. Just like Cherubim and Seraphim, angels. Anything that ends in im is more than one.    Now, we know that God the Father was there, and you believed that. But in Genesis 1:2, the Holy Spirit moved upon the face of the waters. Then in Proverbs 30:4, it says, who hath created all the ends of the earth? Who hath created the world? What is God's name and what is His Son's name? Thats not the New Testament, thats the Hebrew Scriptures. In Isaiah 9:6-7, it says, Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given. And what is the name of this son? The "Mighty God" in the next verse.    You see this? READ YOUR HEBREW SCRIPTURE, MY FRIEND.        Rapture    There is no conflict, its probably that you do not understand that there are two appearings: two comings of Christ - both with an R. The first is the Rapture. That's when we hear the words, come up hither in Revelation 4:1 and we're caught up in the twinkling of an eye, I Corinthians 15:52. The dead in Christ rise first, then we which are alive and remain are caught up with the dead in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, I Thessalonians 4:16.    Now the tribulation hour begins in chapter 6. We're already gone in chapter 4, with the come up hither. We get to verse 12, we have this problem with the sun you mentioned, but that precedes His coming back to earth, the second part of the Second Coming called His Revelation, or his revealing on earth. And revelation 6:12 says, there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sack cloth of hair and the moon as blood. You find it again in Joel chapter 2, verses 30 and 31. But Jesus pinpoints the time in Matthew 24:29, immediately after the tribulation of those days, after the 7 years will the sun become darkened and the moon shall not give her light. Then Christ returns with his people for Jude 14 says the lord comes with ten thousands of his saints. You need to study the two appearings - the two comings of Christ, my friend.    I always remember a child being taught  about the " Rapture" in the Catholic schools, but They called it" being caught up into heaven". Why do our churches seldom mention the event?     Catholic school they taught it as being caught up. That is I Thessalonians 4:17. You know, someone said you can't find the word rapture in the Bible. But you can in the Catholic Bible, the Latin Vulgate by Saint Jerome. When he gets to I Thessalonians 4:17, he uses the word rapiamore  it means raptured  where it says, caught up in our English versions.  Why don't more churches do it? They don't study and they don't know what the Bible says. They don't study the catechism  they dont study the Word of God. God forgive us for that situation.     I believe probably the most obvious would be events that happened in the Old Testament that seem like the Rapture. And, we have some in the Old Testament.     Well not actually what takes place at the Rapture, for then we get brand new bodies, to be like the body of Jesus, I John 3:2-3.    However, there were two men in the Old Testament who were snatched up to meet the Lord in the heavenlies. Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him. Now it was a form of the Rapture, but it wasnt really the Rapture, because hes on the other side in his old body. It was not changed as he went up. And then in 2 Kings 2:11, Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, but hes still there in his body. All the others are there as spirits, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord, 2 Corinthians 5:8. And James teaches us that, chapter 2:27, as the body went out, the spirit is dead, because that sprit is with the Lord. So its a total heaven, full of spirits, even the angels, except these two bodies, and they come back, and they are the two witnesses of Revelation chapter 11. And in verse 12, after theyve been killed, because the crowds dont want to hear their preaching, they are caught up into heaven    He talks about a Pre-tribulation Rapture and the Tribulation is that seven-year period of judgment on earth  Revelation chapters 6 to 18  because we go up in chapter 4 and it only begins in chapter 6. We call it a pre-tribulation Rapture and the Rapture is I Thessalonians 4 verses 16 to 18, when the dead in Christ rise and the living go up with them to meet the Lord in the air and all in the twinkling of an eye, I Corinthians 15:52.     However, during the seven-year period of Tribulation, the greatest revival in history occurs as 144,000 evangelists swarm the world in Revelation 7 verses 4 to 8, and they are preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom  Matthew 24:14. The King is coming and a multitude like the sands of the sea, Revelation 7:9, is converted and verse 14 says, They came out of the Great Tribulation and washed their robes, made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Because of it, death comes to those new converts during that seven-year period in Revelation 6:9, 13:50 and Revelation 20 verse 4. Now Christ comes back with His saints, Jude 14, and Daniel 12:2 - the Old Testament Jews are raised and at that point, all those who died during the Tribulation are also raised. I hope that answers your question.    You notice. The 144,00 is Old testament evagelists. This will disappoint the Jehovah Witness'.    All of the Old Testament Believers have to be washed in The Blood of The Lamb. Jesus came to "Fulfill The Law of Moses. Not to change it.

(Ex. Matthew 28:19, 2 Cor. 13:14, Heb. 9:14) Obviously the word came about to describe the 3 ( as in "Tri-") Persons of God (The Father, Son and Holy Sprirt).    The term "Rapture" is also not mentioned in the Bible, however there are descriptions of the event of our gathering together to be with Christ. (1 Thess 4:17)  The term "rapture" is derived from the Latin Vulgate of the above scriptural refrence - "we will be caught up" (Latin: rapiemur).    Hope this helped    God bless.|`|3313e1c5bf78183621f294d9399a3e04aa	You may also like to know that there is no "J" or even that sound in Hebrew.|`|01f5341d0d029dbc96f058ba056b39abaa	The Word, "Rapture":  If you check any exhaustive concordance,  you'll not find the word "rapture" listed. However, we know that the Bible clearly teaches that believers will be caught up into the clouds at Jesus' coming, so where did the word rapture come from? It comes from the familiar rapture text:    1 Thessalonians 4:15-18 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, and remain until the coming of the Lord, shall not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and thus we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.    The ancient texts of New Testament scripture were written in the Greek language, and the Greek word for "caught up" is harpazo. Later, the Bible was translated into Latin over 15 centuries ago. The Greek word harpazo was translated as the Latin word "raptios," which was later transliterated into English as the word "rapture". The word rapture means caught up, meanwhile the translators used the words caught up in the English Bible rather than the word rapture, so that people could more easily understand the concept. Nevertheless, the word rapture is a valid word to describe the catching up of believers when they are changed into their immortal bodies.    The Words, "the Holy Trinity":  The word "Trinity" is not used in Scripture. This is a term that is used to attempt to describe the triune God, the fact that there are 3 coexistent, co-eternal persons that make up God. Understand that this is NOT in any way suggesting 3 Gods. The Trinity is 1 God made up of 3 persons. There is nothing wrong with using the term "Trinity" even though the word is not found in the Bible. It is shorter to say the word "Trinity" than to say "3 coexistent, co-eternal persons making up 1 God." Consider this: the word grandfather is not used in the Bible either. Yet, we know there were grandfathers in the Bible. Abraham was the grandfather of Jacob.  What should be of real importance is that the concept that is REPRESENTED by the word "Trinity" does exist in Scripture.|`|AA11299301	No, that is Pauline doctrine and was invented by a pagan Roman Emperor in 325 CE (ad).|`|43fedee8de71d47b8d6291e9d46d4943aa	No, those were made up later on, as opposed to the Bible, which was made up earlier on.

I placed 1Thessalonians 4:13-18 for context.      "Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope. 14We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. 15According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. 16For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. 17After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. 18Therefore encourage each other with these words    The word for Trinity comes from the Old testment Deuteronomy 6:4 "Hear O Israel the Lord our God is One."  The word for one in this is a hebrew word for unity not quantity.  When translated from Hebrew to Greek the Trinity comes into play.

Never once did Jesus (peace be upon him) claim to be God. If you look into the bible, if you have a red lettered one that highlights supposedly what Jesus has said, than never once will you find that he told his people to worship him. On the contrary, he said "Worship Thy Father Alone" i.e. worship God Alone.    Third of All, In Islam we believe in Jesus as a highly respected Prophet of Allah (God). just like Moses, Adam, Abraham, Noah, etc.    They All came with the same message : To worship the creator Alone.    Indeed, it is very blasphemous to say that Jesus Is God.   1. Jesus was A human, and everyone will agree upon that. meaning he ate, slept, used the bathroom, etc. Things that Muslims Believe are not attributes fit for the Lord of the Universe, because he is free of all needs.     2. The Christians believed that Jesus died on the Cross. How can God Die? if that were the case, than how can it be that he would be on the cross saying "Why have you forsaken me" to the one who is in heaven, if they were one in the same. and how is it that He knew he would die, but didnt know at the same time?    and if he died for 3 days, who was God during those 3 days?    nothing makes sense.    but everything in Islam Makes sense. wouldnt it be more logical that he were a Righteous Prophet of God, rather than God himself?    If you believe  1. that there is no object worthy of worship but Allah (God)  2. you believe in the angles  3. Heaven and hell  4. The Books that came before (the Old testament, Gospels, Quran)  5. you believe in the all the Prophets of God starting from Adam, including Moses, Jesus, Abraham, Noah, and Muhammad peace be upon all of them)  and finally  6. Divine decree.    than welcome to Islam.    Finally, if you do not wish to listen to anything i've said, at least do one thing which you have nothing to lose.    Seek guidance from God himself to guide you on the strait path, and see where it leads you.    I Swear by Allah, that if you Sincerely and whole-heartedly ask Him for Guidance to the truth. He will lead you to it.    you have nothing you lose.    I ask God to guide you all to the truth. ameen.|`|f59ac0908596732063f124dfa7f07636aa	You will not find the exect word "Trinity" in the Bible but it's existance is confirmed in Mark 1: 10-11; Acts 1: 4-5; Matthew 28: 19.

This is waged on the spiritual plane.  As physical beings we are caught in the middle.  We cannot defeat the forces of evil, that is the devil and his angels.  This is why we have Jesus.  The devil has been condemned before the foundation of the world, but his time of incarceration has not yet come.  He knows that his time is short and that he will lose in the end (he knows every word in the Bible).  Because of who he is---pure evil---he wants to do as much damage to God's creation before his demise.   This is why he corrupted Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden.  Jesus fights the battles for us that we cannot.  Casting out devils is but a small part of spiritual warfare.  Our main weapons are faith and the word of God.  When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness he used God's word to ward off the devil.  Since that time, Christians have done the same thing.  This is why the bible is referred to as the Sword.

AA11536715	Footprints in the Sand by Mary Stevenson    One night a man had a dream. He dreamed he was  walking along the beach with the Lord. Across the  sky flashed scenes from his life. For each scene, he  noticed two sets of footprints in the sand: one  belonging to him, and the other to the Lord. When  the last scene of his life flashed before him, he  looked back at the footprints in the sand. He  noticed that many times along the path of his life  there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed  that it happened at the very lowest and saddest  times in his life. This really bothered him and he  questioned the Lord about it. "Lord, You said that  once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all  the way. But I have noticed that during the most  troublesome times in my life, there is only one set  of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed  you most you would leave me." The Lord replied,  "My son, My precious child, I love you and I would  never leave you. During your times of trial and  suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it  was then that I Carried You."|`|AA11931000	its footprints in the sand, all you have to do is google 'poem footprints  www.amandashome.com/footprints.html - 4k

Are you referring to "string theory" in physics where everything in the universe is a vibration?  I learned about this just the other evening.  I find it fascinating.  Also, check out "The Color of Infinity" from PBS, where we can hear colors, and see sounds.  It boggles the mind.    Favorite songs:    Vivaldi's Four Seasons (esp.

The Great Mind of God and His Children fire off of that current or Force as Thought is carried through the One Mind that fills all space.    The holy sons of God know something of music!  It pours from our Being here in the physical world, where all is material.    Jesus speaks of the Forgotten Song that exists in our Reality.  Let Him speak :  "Listen - perhaps you catch a hint of an ancient state not quite forgotten; dim, perhaps, and yet not altogether unfamiliar, like a song whose name is long forgotten, and the circumstances in which you heard completely unremembered.  Not the whole song has stayed with you, but just a little wisp of melody, attached not to a person or a place or anything particular.  But you remember, from just this little part, how lovely was the song."    "The notes are nothing.  Yet you have kept them with you, not for themselves, but as a soft reminder of what would make you weep if you remembered how dear it was to you.. . .Listen, and see if you remember an ancient song you knew so long ago and held more dear than any melody you taught yourself to cherish since."    This is a bit complex, but Ave Maria is my favorite song in all my life.  I know in Latin it means "Hail Mary" and is a song dedicated to her - but I don't hear it that way.      I do not speak Latin, so the words do not come to me.  But the melody  - I can hardly bear up under it.  Sometimes, I feel myself bending under from its beauty.  To me, without the rational meaning of the song, I HEAR supplication to the Father to the point of begging.  I become a beggar in front of Him, until the music almost throws me to my knees.  This is what I HEAR.|`|AA10229890	Ah, you heard of the Music of the Spheres, I take it?    It does, it does. But, we don't choose the sounds.    If I could choose one song... hmn...    ...

AA10025366	The bible tells us that believers will stand before the judgment seat of Christ, to receive rewards for those things done on earth.  So there is going to be some differing of rewards.    The bible also says that since we believe in Jesus....our sins have been washed away.  God puts them as far from us as the east is from the west and remembers them no more.  Thus, it wouldn't make sense, if He says that in His word, that we would then have them "thrown back in our faces" at judgment.  This, of course, are for those who have placed their faith in Christ.    Nonbelievers are at the Great White Throne judgment, before God, not the throne of Christ.  A much different outcome for them.    Just a note about question  2...it sounds very much like purgatory.  Purgatory is a Catholic belief, not biblical.|`|AA10883660	The Bible teaches that only 144,000 men and women from this earth will go to heaven to rule as kings and priests with Christ Jesus.(Rev.14:1-4)These ones must remain faithful till death and then are rewarded with immortal life in heaven and all receive the same reward.  If we are truly repentent and pray for forgiveness,our Heavenly Father sees in our heart.He knows our motives and He sees if we are sincere.If we are truly repentent and sincerely try not repeat our mistakes,He is always ready to forgive.(Ex.34:6,7)  Jehovah God knows we are sinners and will fall many times.How could a loving Father knowing that  create a place of torment and allow his followers to suffer.  The Bible does not teach a place of eternal torment,nor does it teach that all go to heaven.(Ps.37:9-11,29;Pr2:21)  The Israelites were punished because they wilfully sinned aagainst their Creator.But you must remember in those forty years,Jehovah provided them with food,water,even their sandals never wore out!So He may have punished them but He still looked after them.|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	If your really lucky, you will get to blink out of existence.|`|9f4b71c0b4fdc0ebf5e1d60b49876f03aa	 1 - No there are no levels in heaven.  Matthew 5:19 if taken out of context could be misinterpreted to show that there are different levels, but this is not the case.  I'd be happy to go into the meaning of this verse if you'd like.  There is no other indication that heaven is leveled.     2 - No.  There is no indication in the Bible that anything happens before going into heaven ever.  This means no 'purgatory'.  From Revelations it indicates that we will all be dead until the second coming of Christ when we will all rise to be judged.|`|AA11812186	You can read Dante's ideas.

Anyway this two books are fiction.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Whatever you choose to believe about the specific evil of various type of sins, you must understand that every sin has far reaching consequences.     Forgiveness itself does not remedy the effective consequences of those sins.    Let's say you murder a young family man, and as a result, his wife remarries a scoundrel who kills her, runs off, and leaves her two childen orphans, who are themselves abused, and later turn into criminals. Then, the cycle repeats itself.    Your sin set it all into motion, so your sin was much more serious than you might have thought.    Assuming total forgiveness from God, one who sins less, and who sins less greviously, does less harm, so would merit more "glory" in heaven.    This goes against the teachings of people like Martin Luther, by matches up quite nicely with the teachings of Jesus Christ, his apostles, and his church.|`|28ed371dd52f9a3649593877293e947eaa	Sins are equal in Gods eyes, you ask for forgivness and truly mean it which only God knows and you are forgiven, Jesus died to save us so all we need to do is beleive in him to go to heaven.

If a person honestly asks for forgiveness, and then sins no more. they are forgiven.  We all need to ask for forgiveness daily.  For myself some days it is ALL day.      As for Heaven, nobody is really sure that I know, but if you read  enough the answers are there.|`|AA10770054	Every one will completely happy.  Some will have more capacity than others for happiness.     Don't worry about this at all.  Just live your life to the best of your abilities with love for all in an unselfish way.  Not only will you ensure you gain your etarnal award in heaven, but you will find that your life here on earth will be intensely rewarding and joyful.    Try to be positive, concentrate on doing good rather than worrying about penalties for being bad. Remember Jesus died for us to atone for our sins. Be prepared to accept grace and forgiveness and concentrate on living your life in an unselfish and loving way.  God Bless and best regards.|`|82464ed9790a90bbfca11a79763882a4aa	Different denominations have different views on  1. Mine's view is that although there is no material gain at all in heaven from good deeds, you keep the relationship you had at the end of your life with jesus christ. Therefore if you're following him and dedicating your life to him, you'll have a really nice friend in heaven right away. In fact the most powerfull friend ;)    Again different denominations think different things. Catholics believe in something called purgatory where you spend large ammounts of time to atone for your sins. Purgatory, from what I know, seems like a lesser form of hell. more melancholy than horrible. (course meloncholy over a few hundred years IS horrible.)    In my denomination, though, the price you pay for your sins is driving yourself away from God (assuming you've accepted Jesus as your saviour, message me for more on this). If you haven't been saved, then the price you pay is eternity in hell, no matter the sins you've done or how often, you're still branded a sinner from Adam's fault.|`|c2f96e40e5c8a5e1b993a513a1fe6af2aa	Interesting question Im not sure how to answer  1 so lets try  2.   Yes everyone sins (whatever way people percieve it from different religious view points) I must say though that once you ask God  (christian view) for forgiveness and that you believe in his manifestation as a human (Jesus) to redeem the world from sin itself, then your in the clear! Its much more then asking forgivenss though, for a person must walk as if he is forgived and that he/she wont do it again. Although there are people who have repented and still continue in there sins they asked forgiveness from , they are the ones who face an unknown judgement. Whether if its your PURGATORY vision or Hell itself...one must find the answer for himself from the source within. Whatever source you may seek from is entirely up to you. Dont you just love freedom of choice?

Please look at http://www.booksamillion.com/ncom/books?... for a different and unusual take on eschatology and last days. You will be surprised.    A little light here....the word "Mark" is also rendered as "Character". We know a character in the Chinese alphabet is the same as a "mark". Character also has a completely different meaning....how we conduct ourselves. To take the "mark" of the Beast on the hand or forehead means to assume Satan's Character in our deeds (hands) and thoughts(forehead)....it is not some tattoo. The Book of Revelation also mentions the "Mark of God", but no one ever talks about that mark.

3573fa5dce0c4c57acc61ab0030eb500aa	as an ambidextrous teacher i've had lots of information and experience in knowing about left and right handedness.  first of all, i can use my left hand for certain things only, and my right hand is my 'main' hand now because i've been trained this way since birth (when my granny who was a bit superstitious about left handedness used to hold my left hand and force me to feed with my right, and eventually to use my right hand)  because i was really left-handed.  now i never knew all this but one day, in high school, i was bored, i took out a scrap piece of paper and started practising to write with my left hand, pretty much like one does in primary school when you first start to read/write (although i could do both before i went to school, my left-handed cousin had taught me).  i went through weeks doing this practise thing and one day my dad saw me doing it at home, he asked what i was doing, i said, i just feel interested in being able to write with both hands.  my dad then went on to explain that as a kid i used to go ballistic when my granny forced me to become right-handed, because he lived under her roof, he felt it not his place to disagree with her approach, although he was frustrated in knowing that i am really left-handed.  i'm more right handed now than left handed but i can write with both equally well, well nearly, but definitely legibly with either.  The thing i've learnt at university and ongoing training is that left handed people exercise the right hand side of their brain more and right handed people the left side of the brain.  the right hand side of the brain is said to control your artistic side, and the other side, the one of reason and logic.  some people are multi-functional and generally have higher iq's than say, someone who is simply used to using one hand alone.  i'm a part time artist, i write and have published poems too, i do think my ambidextrous approach has had a hand in it (pun definitely intended!).  if you are left handed and you have an instinct telling you so (like i have had) then exercise it and see if it nurtures whatever it is inside your brain that needs reawakening!  have fun!

Even then I do not have any hate-redness and I have Muslim friends and observe their religious activities. So in India Id-ul-fitr is celebrated as below:    After the Holy month of Ramadan, in which the Muslims are asked to observe fast and do extra prayers and observe religious values regidly, the Muslims celebrate the sighting of the new moon (start of the new Muslim month) by going to bazaar, shopping malls, with their families and children for Eid shopping. In Pakistan, the night before Eid is called Chand Raat, or night of the moon. Women, especially young girls often paint each others' hands with traditional henna and wear colorful bangles.    On the morning of Eid ul-Fitr, every Muslim is required to wear new clothes, if he/she can afford them, otherwise wear washed clothes, have a fresh bath and go to mosque for special Eid prayers, thanking Allah (God) for the health enabling a Muslim to observe fast and enjoy the blessings of Allah Almighty during the holy month of Ramadan. The Muslims are ordained to pay Zakat al-Fitr (special charity money) to the poor and needy before the Eid prayer, so that they can also enjoin other Muslims to celebrate the happiness of Eid.    After the prayers, the congregation is dispersed, the Muslims meet and greet each other, family members, children, elders, friends etc. etc.    Some Muslims specially go to graveyard to pray for the departed and convey their salam (peace). Usually, children visit their parents and other family elders to pay respects and greet.    Special arrangements are made for the family/friends to visit each other to greet on this special occasion. They even exchange gifts, pay charity to needy and enjoy.    One of the special dishes in Pakistan and Fiji is savayya, a dish of fine, toasted vermicelli noodles [3]. Elder family members give eidi (small amount of money or gifts) to children. After meeting friends and relatives, some people go for joyous parties, feasts, special carnivals and parks (with picnics, fireworks, etc.). In Pakistan, many bazaars, malls, and restaurants get crowded with people.    Some people also avail this opportunity to distribute Zakat, the obligatory tax on one's wealth, to the needy.    In this way, the Muslims celebrate their Eid ul-Fitr by thanking Allah Almighty and brining their family, friends and the poor and needy closer.|`|5e424ef4e1757d8f9231215ac9e42ae5aa	after eid prayers, the whole family would go and visit the graveyard of my beloved arwah brother, recites yassin and such. we then would go and visit some relatives, which will take a whole day!but syawal only comes once a year, and i love eid.|`|1adc00a0289a7f4b95b068f0d00ed0f0aa	I'm an expatriate in your country and this will be my fifith Eid here.

If your answer is no, you shouldn't so it either.
AA11397626	I came back from my 27 months in Peace Corps this past December. I was very much welcomed for my teaching, and I made friends that I will never forget -- both among my fellow volunteers, and among the people of Tanzania.     What Peace Corps requires is that you have a skill you can use in volunteering. What have you done with your life so far? Do you know anything about health? Anything about agriculture, carpentry, or another skill with your hands?  Do you have experience in teaching, or a degree in science or math?      It is most definitely an experience worth having! It gave me two years' experience in teaching, with ESL experience that helped me to get a job teaching at a good private school. Beyond the gain back at home, I was able to show some of my family the country (a visit from home) and I was able to make a difference in the lives of many students and a large number of friends from every country in the world. If you have the freedom to spend two years away from the States, you should definitely volunteer!     The Peace Corps is for US citizens only and is therefore more careful with its volunteers than many organizations. As a fellow volunteer stated, the organization is perfect for someone who has never left the country before. There are many weeks of training, and the volunteers are assigned "homestay families" who are also coached in the safety and teaching of their volunteer. Some of our volunteers who had experience outside the country found their extra care tiresome, but it does mean that the volunteers are safe.    Peace Corps does not have an active program in any country that is volitile, and if an area becomes volitile they will evacuate the volunteers. There are drills and plans to follow for each volunteer so that they know their role in such a situation.     That said, you may also want to check in the VSO or Volunteer Services Organization. If you join Peace Corps, you may choose a region of the world -- such as South America or Sub-Saharan Africa. If you join the VSO, you may actually make a search online and see what jobs will be available to apply for in a given country.     VSO also gives you a bit more freedom in your travelling. This may be a good thing if you have travelled the world a lot, but it also means that safety is not so assured. With the Peace Corps, there are contacts in every town and the people in your village have all necessary contact information with headquarters should they be needed. They also provide free medical care at the headquarters. If there is any danger by terrorists or civil unrest, they will bring you to headquarters and, if necessary, help you all to evacuate.       The "food allowance" is about the same for both organizations, housing is provided for both organizations, and both give you language training and a "counterpart" or helpful local resident to help orient you. They both also participate in the same types of jobs, for the same lengths of time, and are often nearby neighbors at their respective villages (nearby being 20km or so). The two organizations work together closely.     You really should look into both of them and see if you would like to join; it is most definitely an experience worth having. You can contact me also, if you have questions. You have plenty of time to research it.    And yes, the volunteers made a tangible difference in their communities and the ones nearby. There are environmental volunteers (digging wells, teaching agriculture, teaching sanitation), health volunteers (teaching both in schools and in communities, including HIV/AIDS education), and education volunteers (teaching primarily in schools, science and math subjects).     There are also NGO's (Non-Governmental Organizations) in many countries, which can give you a long-term or even a permanent position.   They work with more specific issues, such as AIDS education, literacy in general, or religious education.      Try looking into things!  You have Americorps, Peace Corps, VSO, Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, Caretakers of the Environment, and NGO's. Most of these will give a (small) food allowance for your help.     If you have other questions, let me know! If you has experience with the Spanish language, there is a very good chance that they would accept you for the Western Hemisphere assignments, and there are many more environmental needs there. Depending on what your abilities are with other areas, fluency in Spanish alone can be a useful qualification.  Fluency in French can be a benefit in gaining an assignment  in Western Africa.  Just FYI!|`|e21c4f8cbf82990cfe523838ebd4e857aa	http://l.webring.com/hub?ring=rpcv    has 48 sites by RPCV's

Have you really read and studied the Bible?  Why are you so angry?  Christ has given me personal peace, I would love for you to have some!|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Do you mean to minister professional or in a lay capacity? If you take the professional route, you may or may not have much choice is the church you get (depends on denomination). Depending on your church, you could well have to hide a lot of your real beliefs -- I spent a year in seminary, you'd be shocked to find out how many ministers don't exactly believe what they preach. They decided that they didn't mind the compromise.    It's a matter of deciding how much the organization matters to you, how much you're willing to sacrifice towards it, and also how effective you might be. (I'm not a great persuader with groups, much better with one-on-one conversations, so that's where I put my energy.) Remember that if you take the professional route, your economic well-being will be tied up with the arguments....    There are other ways to approach these issues, the most important being to do your best to live your beliefs as thoroughly as you can. Think about your particular strengths and talents -- there are many ways to contribute, what's yours?|`|AA11965094	DUDE GIVE IT TO GOD AND LET HIM CHANGE THE SITUATION AND THEN SIT BACK AND WATCH GOD WORK|`|AA11178704	I'm not sure how effective being a minister would be.  They mostly just preach to people who already agree with them.  But if you're that passionate about it, sure, why not?|`|5b8bf6fff9eec08406ce8610fa1e5c62aa	Objectivity, Objectivity, Objectivity....remove the subjectivmess from Christianity and the answer to your question is YES. Although Christianity does have it's own prejudices (as do all religions) the Ethics, Morals and Principles found in the fundamental teachings are an excellent foundation for a good life. I commend you for being proactive and trying to do something about it rather than sitting back and just complaining.|`|9a83793188befd91164d30a989afadb1aa	Personally I believe that is a fine idea, so long as you believe in the Deity of God, that Jesus is the Messiah, and that as Christians we have been justifed by grace through faith and not through "good deeds".    Other than that....go crazy! if you disagree with the Church I believe it is your duty to try and change it.    Good Luck,    Josh K.    P.S. Just for the record I have to disagree that the teachings of Christ have been "horribly twisted to fit political agendas"|`|AA11610394	unfortunately the government is running things.|`|AA10025366	God calls people to enter the ministry.  A minister, or pastor, would be a person who will devote his life to teaching God's word to whatever "flock" he will be in charge of...his congregation, etc.  It would be impossible for God to call someone who is not acquainted with His son and His word, i.e., an agnostic, someone who does not believe either in Jesus as His savior, or the bible as God's inspired word, to shepherd other believers.  I suggest you first build a foundation on the person, and word, of Jesus Christ by giving your life to Him.  Then you can seek God's will for your life...not the other way around.|`|fef39cf87650c8250aa251223b14a134aa	IN what kind of way do U practise the teachings of Christ eing an agsnostic at the same time?|`|60fa69310f25077ef58daaf06c05ad97aa	Or you could dismiss the incoherent ravings of a lunatic who ran around in the desert 2000 years ago and think for yourself.

When Jesus asked his Disciples "Who do the people say I am" they gave him many answers all of which were wrong. PEOPLE are easily swayed. Then Jesus asked another Question. "And you? Who do you say I am?" this time he got only one answer "The Christ of the Lord GOD" this answer was not of the PEOPLE it was FROM GOD (As Jesus himself said "This answer did not come from you but from God Himself")   So the Answer to your question is who cares what people think of S B it is more important what GOD says about her and the BIBLE is very clear about SPIRITUALISTS and Those who practice Divination.|`|283f74a3d7fa17a75eeba8f2cfdc8076aa	An amazing psychic who has done much good in the world.|`|AA10400770	I think she's kinda over the top.

Eu sou homem, macho, mas poderia ser um gay se na minha infancia me tivesse sujeitado a ser agarrado por trs pelos meus colegas, se minha m?e me criasse como menina, se os meus amigos mais velhos me seduzissem e levassem por outro caminho, ou se eu tivesse nascido com fsico masculino, mas a dosagem hormonal do meu corpo estivesse desequilibrada, com alta dosagem de progesterona. Com as meninas e mulheres acontece a mesma coisa. Mesmssima. S que o inverso (testosterona).  A distancia ou a diferen?a entre o macho perfeito e o masculino gay  muito pequena. O anus proporciona um alto ponto ertico para ser explorado. A falta de mulheres na infancia acaba jogando um garoto na intimidade com outro. Se come?ar, n?o vai mais parar.

One of the special treats that year was lighting the fireworks (Roman candles, bottle rockets, missile batteries, etc.) they had bought out of state (they're illegal in their state, of course!).    Just before they were to arrive, a cousin called, saying his neighbors' plans had just fallen through and asking if he bring them along to the picnic -- they even had extra food to bring. "Sure, the more the merrier!"    When the cousin arrived with his neighbors, it was discovered that the head of that family was a police officer. Johnny's father turned as innocently as he could to his son and whispered to him to grab the paper bag of fireworks sitting in the kitchen and hide them somewhere quickly. Johnny disappeared, and the father changed the topic to food for the day. This family had brought some chicken to grill, so the father told them the gas grill was all set to use out back -- they just had to turn on the gas and push the ignition button with the lid still closed.    They headed out to the back as Johnny returned through the front door. The father hurried to him and said, "Whew, that was close! That man's a police officer, and he almost saw the fireworks. Did you hide them real well?"    "Oh, yeah, nobody will ever think to look in the grill!"|`|AA12318516	hahahahahaha|`|cf870c995715ee4420d815bc12e20daeaa	Is this a question?

I would have to say that based on the store in Fairbanks Alaska, they offer a fair wage and yes there is insurance and other benefits for all their employees ..

When I started, they started cashiers out with a "base" pay of $5.50, then they added about 60 cents for every job that you were at for 4 or more years prior to starting Wal-mart. (which in my case put me at $6.10) And of course if you would over night, you get more.  I would assume that every Wal-mart has different starting pay depending on where it is located.  I live in the deep south where typically pay is lower than most parts of the country.  I would bet that in places where cost of living is higher, the starting pay is higher.    As for insurance, yes they do offer is, but you have to be employeed there for a certain amount of time and work full time. (which I was told that they don't hire ANY full time employees... you have to work your way up to it.)    There are a couple of perks to working at Wal-mart.  There is the discount card. You're also given the option of purchasing stock every pay check.  And if you work hard you can move up in the Wal-mart ranks.    I hope this helps!!!!|`|AA11626870	They make about $7.00 an hour and you have to work at least 32 hrs. to receive insurance. That's in South Carolina

5f2ad941f2552592de82f724d1bb1439aa	El Da de la Tierra es da festivo celebrado en muchos pases. Su promotor, el senador norteamericano Gaylord Nelson, instaur este da para crear un conciencia comn a los problemas de la contaminacin, la conservacin de la biodiversidad y otras preocupaciones ambientales para proteger la Tierra.  La primera celebracin tuvo lugar el 22 de abril de 1970. Fue iniciada por el senador Gaylod Nelson, activista ambientacin popular para la creacin de una agenda ambiental. Para esta convocatoria participaron dos mil universidades, diez mil escuelas primarias y secundarias y centenares de comunidades.    La presin social tuvo sus logros y el gobierno de los Estados Unidos cre la Environmental Protection Agency (Agencia de Proteccin Ambiental) y una serie de leyes destinada a la proteccin del medio ambiente.    En 1972 se celebr la primer conferencia internacional sobre el medio ambiente: la Conferencia de Estocolmo, cuyo objetivo fue sensibilizar a los lideres mundiales sobre la magnitud de los problemas ambientales y que se instituyeran las polticas necesarias para erradicarlos.    Las Naciones Unidas celebran el da de la Tierra cada a?o en el equinoccio vernal (alrededor del 21 de marzo). El 26 de febrero de 1971, el secretario general U Thant firm una proclamacin a ese efecto. Al momento del equinoccio suena la Campana de la Paz en las cede central de la ONU en Nueva York    - El Da de la Tierra es una fiesta que pertenece a la gente y no est regulada por una sola entidad u organismo; tampoco est relacionado con reivindicaciones polticas, nacionales, religiosas, ideolgicas ni raciales.    - El Da de la Tierra apunta a la toma de conciencia de los recursos naturales de la Tierra y su manejo, a la educacin ambiental, y a la participacin como ciudadanos ambientalmente concientes y responsables.    - En el Da de la Tierra todos estamos invitados a participar en actividades que promuevan la salud de nuestro planeta, tanto a nivel global como regional y local.    "La Tierra es nuestro hogar y el hogar de todos los seres vivos. La Tierra misma est viva. Somos partes de un universo en evolucin. Somos miembros de una comunidad de vida interdependiente con una magnificente diversidad de formas de vida y culturas. Nos sentimos humildes ante la belleza de la Tierra y compartimos una reverencia por la vida y las fuentes de nuestro ser..."

68956f7a7773e3064e72396f6c2e38fdaa	Curiosamente, no hubo a?o 0. Alrededor del 750 D.C. le encargaron a un monje llamado Dionisio el Exiguo que hiciera la cuenta. Como slo tena la referencia de que Jess haba nacido en Beln porque haban tenido que movilizarse para un censo, en tiempos de Augusto y de Herodes, buscando informacin, encontr que el censo se haba hecho en el a?o 753 de la fundacin de Roma (los romanos usaron esa fecha para eleborar su propiio calendario, que segua en uso).  Pero lo que este se?or tena de minucioso en investigacin (le tom varios a?os averiguarlo) lo tena de mal matemtico: Pas directamente del a?o 1 A.C. al 1 D.C. saltndose el a?o 0 (nadie le explic lo de los planos cartesianos, tal vez no los haban inventado). Otro error que comet involuntariamente fue que el censo se haba hecho en distintos a?os dependiendo de la provincia, el tena datos de Francia, donde viva, pero en Judea, aparentemente lo hicieron antes. Adems se salt 4 a?os porque los autores no se ponen de acuerdo en el primer a?o de Augusto (ya se pusieron: aunque gobernaba desde el 31A.C., en el 27A.C. fue oficial, por lo que 27A.C. es el primer a?o). As que el buen monje se equivoc sin querer como en 6  7 a?os, pero estara de locos corregirlo a estas alturas.  Los Papas empezaron a usar la fecha en sus documentos en el a?o 813, pero se populariz alrededor del 950 en el resto de la poblacin.|`|64324dcc1b21c24629df66638343ebedaa	con san gregorio magno, un papa que hizo la reforma litrgica en la edad media, y el calendario, que por eso se llama gregoriano. claro. ahora sabemos que se equivoc en su cuenta por una margen entre 6 y 4 a?os.|`|AA11003158	Yo siempre me he preguntado cmo contaban A.C. los a?os, ni modo que iban a decir que estaban viviendo en el a?o 5 a.C.!!!

Tal lnea de pensamiento errneo puede ser inspirada solamente por Satans y creida y ense?ada por instituciones clericales venidas a menos y por todas las otras religiones que son comenzadas y formadas por el hombre natural, y dirigidas por Satans.

c5a8c4d1ade94ba4b1ec1e4351d3fa93aa	Why do some poeple have fetishes? to meet sexual gratification    Panty fetishism is a sexual fetish relating to women's panties. It can also involve printed or electronic material depicting exposure of panties, usually of a softcore nature.    Those affected regard the panties (knickers in the UK) as a sex object and the female sex organs as another. The panties become a central source of desire, and fetishists frequently amass large collections of panties. They can be used or unused, depending on the individual's preference. The connection between the wearer and the panties is important and can be essential. This is not always the case, but it often is.    Usually, the fetishist will first look at them, touch them, imagine the woman wearing them, etc. The next stage normally involves masturbation, and ejaculation onto one pair of panties, frequently while sniffing or even wearing a second pair. The mental link between the panties and their true owner will usually be present, and the fetishist will imagine as he masturbates that he is actually ejaculating over the panties as if they were still being worn by the real owner.|`|e63e0f85e4e799578ba09d338bb1da3daa	simple...it thrills...|`|AA10819547	because they can.|`|AA12337865	Why do you think?

4460369fec7e57c6dcffd34d53efb9d9aa	El termino anglosajon gay, sinnimo en la actualidad de homoxesualidad masculino, tiene su origen en la palabra gai, utilizada en el siglo XIII para referirse a la persona, generalmente un hombre, que practicaba lo que entonces se llamaba el culto al amor corts homoxesual. El amante o compa?ero era conocido como gaiol. No obstante, en los siglos posteriores el trmino gay pas a tener diferentes acepciones. Primero fue acu?ado para nobrar a las prostitutas; ms tarde sirvi para se?alar a cualquier indeseable social y, finalmente, la cultura britanica lo adopt para dirigirse peyorativamente a los homoxesuales. En estados Unidos la primera vez que se utilizo pblicamente el vocablo gay como sinnimo de homoxesualidad fue en la pelcula La fiera de mi ni?a (1938). protagonizada por Gary Grant.|`|290fda62d7d2de71af663935803133d7aa	Para empezar te voy a copiar una liga que tiene la etimologa de la palabra gay y los diferentes significados y hasta cuando se utiliz por primera vez en cine.

La liga es la siguiente:    http://etimologias.dechile.net/?gay    Una vez que te hayas enterado de eso, pasamos a lo siguiente que es el nacimiento de lo que hoy se conoce como el Orgullo Gay y tiene su origen en un movimiento que se creo en 1969 en Nueva York, para ser exacto un 28 de Junio, da que en 1985, se instaur internacionalmente como Da del Orgullo Gay.

In the 1800s the term was used to refer to female prostitutes; to "gay it" meant "to copulate."  traduccion  Ya a principios de 1637 la palabra gay significaba "adicto a los placeres sociales y disperciones".

AA11478267	Religion must have begun with simple rules like Do no evil to others, tell no lie and grew from there. When we fear punishment, we will follow rules, so religion started. Some people interpreted it one way and others in other ways -- hence many different religions.   Like for example if there were no traffic rules and specified punishments for breaking it -- we would all break rules all the time and there would be chaos.  Morality and reasoning are two human attributes and so at some point some one realized the need for written rules -- so began religion.  The path to God is just being good and believing in Him. How you do it is essentially your own perception. When you are in the right direction,, you will know.   The right way to God are many...and you follow the general direction and you will end up there.|`|9f4b71c0b4fdc0ebf5e1d60b49876f03aa	If right is arbitrary (as I am seeing people to respond to this and other questions) then theoretically I can justify a mass genocide of people that I lead and still go to heaven, because I could say that "works for me".  Along these lines, no one can impose a moral law on me because they would be using their subjective viewpoint to impose that law, which would also be correct but may contradict my law.  Contradictory things cannot simultaneously be true so that argument self destructs.    God is objective, as he is the creator of all.  Jesus is the right way, as he is God.|`|AA10787173	There is no universal truth.  It's all good and real. Christians just think they have all the answers.  Right is whatever is right for you.  Alex T.  Oh how it amuses me that people such as yourself believe that one needs religion to be moral.  We need social laws to co-exsist peacefully.  We are social animals and are geared towards accepting social laws that generally prevent things such as mass genocide.  One must seek a self truth, and find peace in that said self truth, but to force others to believe in a violent middle eastern tribal god, which is how the christian god started out, is not only unhealthy but naieve.  'God' if such thing exists to you, did not give all the answers to just one little small portion of the world (the middle east) 2000+ years ago.  That is why it makes more sense to believe all religious paths lead to the same middle.  The judeao-christian religions are the ONLY ones who believe they are the one and true way, therefore they are the contradiction.  They contradict everyone else and incidentally each other:  You need to be saved, you don't need to be saved, once you are saved you are always saved, you can lose your salvation, you need works, you don't need works, you can pray to saints, you can't pray to saints, believing Jesus is your savoir is enough, no you must do more than, there is a trinity, there is not a trinity only one god ect ect.  You guys can't even determine what Christianity is or is not.   The only thing you seem to agree on is that whatever version of Christianity YOU follow is the right one for you.|`|AA10453151	Everyone does have it wrong.

Other times, I'm filled with joy and dance and dance!|`|16d86d89ea0a0e4a140ea2d7c3c80e14aa	Probably the most reasonable reason is that religions play upon emotions such as love, fear, hate, and desire.  It is no wonder that you would feel emotion in anything related to religions, but music especially allows your emotions to have a field day.    Please notice that your feelings are not related to Christianity.  All people of all religions feel emotions and are vulnerable to having their emotions used to maintain and enforce their beliefs.

edfaa3878a1423f4923c2467367d76d0aa	you might have seen several people who have ugly faces or some sort of handicap in your life or anyone funny. do you remember their faces? i bet u dont. even if you remember one, does that affect him or her in anyway?? people today dont have enuf time to think about others. so you think only about yourself.   every person in this world has some thing negative abt him. what we need to look is at the positive things with us. Everyone has something positive. the only difficult thing is to find out that positive thing. once you find out, you will feel better.    you need not hesitate to talk to anyone. you just think that the other person is lesser than you and actually they r hesiatating and you will feel on top.     if you dont feel good about you,no one can. so first you feel confident. think that you r normal. normal people have both negatives and positives. no one in the world has only positives.  if you r from india, u will know salman khan. he is very short. but does he feel low abt it? he just developed his muscles and every one looks upto him whenever they think of strong person. develop your good things and stop thinking abt your bad things. remember the people you meet are also thinking this way only.|`|79d325a9d7089b91075a8438b79efeaeaa	Since you know that what you are thinking is slightly paranoid (and it is good you do know), I would suggest just training yourslef out of it.  It takes time, but I did it.  You don't have to start off by initiating conversations, but try to interact more when spoken to.    By the way, only you notice the little details.  Most of us don't notice much at all.  There was a test done once when people would be talking to someone behind a desk and they would get blocked from viewing them.  The person behind the desk would change and more than 50% didn't notice the change.    Unless you jump around on a pogo stick singing twinkle twinkle little star, people won't notice little things you feel you do wrong.  Just give yourself little steps to conquer and in no time you'll get better.|`|d7777ed8f33647a7607ea1b11b23c239aa	i have the same problem i know the answers to the problem,does not help,I'm to much in my head,too much introspective thinking,causes an effect,think to far head,not enough interpersonal relations,the here now,balls to the walls,good luck,finding the solution|`|4b889b49aa52362263dc8e962d646b45aa	Be brave and start acting a little to be smart   and slowly you wont be acting any longer but would be naturally confident and smart.

They dont think they look good enough.   2. They think they dont know what to say, and if they say something, it ends up being the wrong thing.     Solutions :  1. Personality makeover. Requires a few things:  * Get good dress sense. Do you have a friend who is good at dressing ? Ask him or her to help you buy clothes. Dont' ape his clothing, as what looks good on him may not look good on you.   * Get in shape. If you are too lean or too fat, it may make you feel unconfident. I suggest joining a martial arts class. Apart from the usual cardio-vascular improvements, it also instills a lot of confidence in yourself.   * Clean up. Be neat and presentable at all times, wether in a formal dress or casuals. Keep your room and car clean and neat.    2. Talking problems :  Read. Read the classics in unabridged forms. Read editorials in newspapers. Listen more than you talk - and when you talk , just say a few lines about your opinion. If you have done enough research - your opinion will be bang on.    Another thing - take risks. The most confident people are those who take risks - but have also calculated the pros and cons of it.     And lastly, dont try to copy anyone. Be your own Person.    Its ok to feel the sinking feeling in your stomach at times. Its true courage to stand up and face your fears.|`|9ada2c6c29778e8f27a167fc8d61418aaa	i think confidence will come in time. as long as you know you are great then it doesn't matter what other people think. we spend half our life making decisions based on how we present ourselves and thats just a waste.

YOU don't have any negative points unless YOU think YOU do! There is only one YOU in the whole universe! How can someone else tell YOU how YOU should be? They can't! Only YOU can decide who and what YOU are. They can suggest all they want. But, nobody but You are in control of YOU!!

Puede ser que tu atraccin hacia las chicas derive de tu Androfobia o sea tu preferencia sexual original. Muchas mujeres son androfbicas porque tuvieron experiencias sexuales traumticas con hombres, muchas de estas experiencias son por violencia sexual. Una mala imagen paterna tambin es un factor de peso importante en el desarrollo de esta adversin.  En mi opinin personal no deberas debanarte los sesos cuestionando tu sexualidad (al menos no por ahora) Lo recomendable sera que acudas donde un profesional que te ayude a superar tu problema de androfobia. Slo con ayuda de un experto podrs determinar si la preferencia que tienes hacia las chicas es derivada de tu adversin hacia los hombres o es tu preferencia sexual original. Debes tener en cuenta que hay lesbianas que no son androfbicas, pero no hay androfbicas no que no sean lesbianas.  Acudir con un profesional aclarar muchas de tus dudas y miedos, adems te servir porque servir para mejorar tus relaciones no sexuales con los hombres que te rodean (familiares, amigos, colegas e incluso hijos varones, si decides tenerlos)  Recuerda que una persona homosexual (lesbiana o gay) es la que se siente atrada psicolgica, fsica, espiritual y sexualmente hacia personal de su mismo sexo.  ?Mucha suerte!|`|171d7c8f53070db083fd160704cce9e4aa	No creo que seas lesbiana.

Lamento mucho la discriminacin que existe, pero se debe a la sociedad estos tienen un patrn de conducta muy marcado y salirse de ello, les crea inseguridad, la sociedad, la religin y el que dirn son los peores enemigos de los gays.  Las personas creen que ser homosexual es un mal contagioso, los hacen a un lado porque temen que los vayan a confundir con esa opcin sexual, otra cosa tambin es por que "creen" que ser gay = SIDA, lo cual es muy falso, el gay es un SER HUMANO y nosotros que representamos a la sociedad debemos APRENDER A RESPETARLOS.

Sabes, es lamentable que hoy da las personas sean tan ignorantes y faltas de amor y respeto por los dems.    Las personas que rechazan a los homosexuales son personas que aun no han alcanzado la madurez necesaria para saber que los homosexuales son personas dignas y merecedores de ser respetados.    Por el hecho de las preferencias sexuales de los homosexuales no les da el derecho de discriminar, rechazar, humillar, lastimar y ofender a estas personas.    Yo, muy responsablemente digo que siento mucho respeto por los homosexuales, porque se que son personas nobles, trabajadoras y responsables.  De hecho, tengo varios amigos homosexuales y comparto con ellos, yo no soy homosexual, y por el hecho de compartir con ellos tampoco quiere decir que vaya a ser homosexual.    Lo que quiero decir es que la sociedad no ha logrado comprender que los homosexuales son seres humanos igual que los dems, sienten, padecen, ren, lloran.  Aparte, muchas de esas personas que tanto reprocha y discriminan a los amigos homosexuales, viven del dinero que aportan en sus contribuciones, (porque ellos tambin trabajan y pagan contribuciones).    Ves, en realidad son ignorantes y carecen de amor hacia el prjimo.    Adelante, no te intimides, ni les prestes atencin.  Habemos personas que te respetamos y admiramos.

AA11476749	Honestly, not everyone who claims to be of Christ is in fact a Christian.  (Matthew 7:21)  Secondly, a lot of folks on this site are likely very young, or are new to Christianity.  Therefore, the may not know what the Bible says, or may misunderstand.      Now, the command of Jesus to turn the other cheek, and to care for your enemy is completely valid, and stands today.  But Jesus was speaking also to individuals.  Because there is no such thing as a truly Christian state, the commands don't apply to nation states.    When soldiers came up to Jesus or His followers, they were never turned them away, but were dealt with where they were.  (Cf.  Matthew 8:8ff, Luke 3:14ff, Acts 10:7ff)  They were never told they had to quit being soldiers.      Jesus Himself also said that He didn't come to bring peace.  "Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword!"  (Matthew 10:34)  In the context, He spoke about how people, even within families, would be at enmity with one another.  Kinda like what goes on here at Yahoo Answers.    The Roman Empire's fall was the result of two primary causes.  It was rotting from the inside because of its culture of corruption, and secondly, because even within the government, people were coming to Christ, and advocating a different custom.  Thousands died while turning the cheek.  Yet, Christianity stands, and the Roman Empire no longer exists...for a time.|`|34ab7f36dfc7f27dfeae36e6ef736b37aa	christans are morons and they will always be.

But when he was anticipating being arrested, he told his disciples to take swords. Although he rebuked his disciple for using it later (Jesus was going willingly), I think this shows us that we should at least be prepared to defend ourselves and have the right to.    There are many places in the bible where God supports war, even commands it. And, in case you haven't read it, it prophecies that in the end he will make war against the nations (not us, but he himself).|`|cababea1eca7a2e24fb2f08a4c7b7a47aa	I think what you are seeing is confusion in the question, leading to confusing answers.  I, myself, believe that if someone attacks the God given rights of others, there is nothing at all wrong with war.  What is our God given rights?  Freedom, in all it's aspects, whether evil or just.  We are given the free choice to govern ourselves, to elect to have order within our societies, and justly punish those who do wrong in our societies.  How do we come up with rules for our societies? They are clearly written throughout The Holy Bible. We are given the choice to believe or not believe in God, we are given the freedom to do as we please, to sin, to repent, to do rightly.  All these freedoms were given to us, and through our Constitution, are still alive today.  We are in Iraq to give freedom to those who never had freedom.  Is there any other greater sacrifice than that?  Our brave men and women going to Iraq, to take the chance of dieing, to defend the freedoms of other, that were granted to us all by the power and glory of The Lord Jesus Christ?

a80790f14cea0208b00f4d4ef6200982aa	Parece que aqu se confunden trminos con otras cosas que nada tienen que ver. Un homosexual es tan slo una persona que no es heterosexual y viceversa. Lo dems son a?adidos estpidos. Lo triste es que esos a?adidos estpidos no slo los crean los homfobos sino los creen tambin algunos homosexuales. Si usted es un arrogante machito no lo es menos por serlo, y si un cursi homosexual tampoco lo es menos por serlo. A un heterosexual le puede gustar ABBA, el color rosado y ser afeminado perfectamente, y a un homosexual ir de machito (los hay muchos). En Esparta era obligado entre los soldados ser homosexual, y en otras sociedades judeocristianasislmicas lo contrario debido entre otras cosas porque el placer homosexual no es reproductivo, e incluso no ve con buenos ojos el placer heterosexual no reproductivo como todos sabemos an hoy. El tema es que hay tambin mucho negocio homosexual con estas asociaciones estpidas entre tener un gusto sexual y ropas, msica y dems objetos varios. En la Atenas clsica era tan normal que ni siquiera exista la catalogacin pues casi todos eran bisexuales, Platn por ejemplo. Si no importara tanto el gusto sexual de cada cual y s su calidad humana dejaramos de vivir en la prehistoria.|`|AA10819547	Yo no tengo nada mas que apuntar, menos de que estoy de acuerdo con Luzvelorio.|`|6b3fde994adfaacb99cca2c19cb74eb4aa	Sera una nueva  reaccion , ya que en muchos pueblos antiguos la Homosexualidad era comun , lo unico que se es que no son gente normales , anomalias del, cerebro enfermedad hormonal , un problema genetico, lo que se quiera , pero un problema , lo que si no estoy de acuerdo es que se les discrimine , pero lo otro , que se les permita adoptar , casarse y todo lo demas , me parece que tampoco es conveniente .|`|b1a6723e323063367de04b38a167020aaa	1. el aspecto religioso es muy acojido por las personas de nuestra sociedad.  2. el aspecto etico y moral que va muy relacionado con el 1  3. los homosexuales son muy exivicionista como sea queiren llamar la atencion|`|70fd202362e5dcccd7d62774f3429d08aa	por que tantos homosexuales?|`|70b60176aa35ec33ee2d99a2f8d170f3aa	Soy heterosexsual, pero yo pienso que cada cual puede hacer de su panza un pito y de su culo un tambor.a mi no me molesta.  y si algun dia me cruzo con alguno que le gusto,si me paga el alquiler de mi depto que vaya abriendo las cachas nomas.que lemando todo adentro|`|4a062039468192c1fad30030856b5cb1aa	La biblia dice que todos somo iguales pero tambien dice que aquel que sea homosexual no entrara en el reino de Dios..de verdad ahortia no recuerdo el versiculo ni la pag...aunque yo no tengo nada encontra de ellos son seres humanos igual que todos pero hay unos que se dedican a la tarea de enga?ar a las mujeres se casan, tienen hasta hijos, y despues la supuesta esposa se entera que es gay...esto si me parece un poco doloroso es mejor que acepten de un momento lo que son asi hieran a sus familiares...bueno suerte....de verdad todo el mundo no tiene tanta descriminacion a los homosexuales.|`|33c686c530e288a6074b78b2892dd105aa	en la biblia dice que dios nos creo a todos iguales, entonces me pregunto ?con lo geys que hizo experimento? jejejeje  al principio me costaba trabajo aceptarlos por que no estaba acostumbrado, mis padres nunca me ense?aron de que eso era algo mas de la vida, pero ahora tengo varios amigos geys y dos de ellos son mis mejores amigos es mas son mis confidentes, nunca he sido tan sinceros como soy con ellos, aqui lo unico que hay es que educarnos a respetar|`|222d51021dff5316079fb660396d725aaa	por la misma razon por la que se discrimina a los ******, a los asiaticos o a los latinoamericanos, por complejo de superioridad.

Por que hubo una religin que nos meti en la cabeza, segn su conveniencia, que ser homosexual es algo pecaminoso, mortal, aberrante y siguen las calificaciones y adjetivos.  Religiosamente pienso que los gays son tambien hijos de Dios, que forman parte de su creacin. Cuntos talentos gays hubo,hay y habr en el mundo que han dejado su talento y sabidura como otros tantos heterosexales?  De Dios para abajo ninguna persona debera juzgarlos, discriminarlos, matarlos, excluirlos. Un gran sabio que tambien no pronunci palabra alguna en contra o a favor de los gays fu Jesus quien dijo muy sabiamente "primero saca la suciedad de tu ojo antes de limpiar la de los dems" o que "en la tierra no hay ninguna persona libre de pecado". Sin pensar que el homosexualismo sea un pecado.  El Papa cuando los condena se olvida que un gobernante de un pais democratico no solo debe gobernar a los catolicos si o tambien al musulman, al judio, al ateo, al blanco, al ***** al hetero a gay, al diferente. Su Homofobia es lamentable. Estoy seguro que Dios no ve con buenos ojos la exclusin que hace a "esos otros hijos de Dios"  Siempre cre que Dios los cre para estos tiempos: para el control de natalidad del mundo moderno.  Socialmente: Son una necesidad. Si no dnde encontrar talentosos bailarines, peluqueros, mdicos, policias, obreros, artistas, arquitectos, decoradores, dise?adores de modas o sea un montn de actividades similares a las de los hetero.  En Argentina afortunadamente hay una gran apertura hacia el respeto y la tolerancia a la Comunidad Gay con leyes que los protegen, Union Civil, derechos de pensin, etc. Falta mucho an pero estan en buen camino las autoridades nacionales y algunas provinciales y municipales.  Finalmente lo nico que le critico a ciertos homosexuales es esa necesidad de provocar y mostrarse con cierto aire de escandalo en sus manifestaciones. Creo que no es necesario. Esas actitudes los aleja en vez de acercar a la sociedad. Deberan ser un poco ms recatados para ganarse al resto de la sociedad.  No discriminar. Vivir y dejar vivir. La vida es bella.

AA10949487	I won't do this in your order.  Hebrews is from an ancient word probably originally Egyptian, habiru, meaning wanderers, a secondary meaning was mercenaries. Hebrew later became the name of the Semitic language now used in the modern Israel. It is related to Akkadian an derives from the west Canaanite language.  Semites are speakers of a family of languages called Semitic, that include Arabic, Hebrew,  the almost extinct Aramaic ( which was the language of Jeshua Bar Yusef ( misnamed Jesus by the Greeks)) and the extinct language Akkadian. Jews are the followers of the religion Judaism but the term also is used for the ancient hill people of southern Palestine who are of Canaanite origins. Arabs are the native peoples of the arabian Peninsular. Pure blooded Jews are racially the same as Arabs as are all the other peoples in your question except Elamites. Canaan was a very old country of North and Central Palestine. Its people linguistically and recailly are the predecessors of the Jews and Phonecians. Phonecia was a country of North coastal Palestine famous for trading. Its people established colonies all over the mediterranean and went as far as Southern England, to obtain Tin. They established the state of Carthage in North Africa and challenged Rome for supremacy. Elam was an ancient country on the North shores of the Persian gulf that existed before the Persians arrived there. It fought wars with Babylon. It is unusual in that its language, partially decifered, appears to have no relation to any other language. Samaritans.- When Babylon conquered the Jews about 1700 of their elite were taken as captives to Babylon (about 700BCE). The captives spent at least 70 years in Babylon. When Babylon was conquered by the Persians, the Persians freed these Jews. and some of them returned to Jerusalem. The returnees had been greatly influenced by the Persian religion and incorporated this influence into Judaism. When they returned to Jerusalem, under the influence of Ezra they amended Judaism significantly to incorporate these Persian concepts. Many of the Jews who had remained behind in Palestine did not accept these changes. They became the Samaritans and built their own temple and worshipped using this older form of Judaism in an area called Samaria|`|AA11624336	idk|`|AA11559402	They all belong to ancient languages.|`|AA12269449	The word "Semites" is an ethnic term that encompasses a large number of people and characteristics. For example, both Hebrew and Arabic are Semitic languages. It is now mostly used interchangeably with the words "Jews" or "Jewish."    Arab is also an ethnic term used to describe the people who are from the region known as the "Middle East" who are not Jewish or European.     Samaritans, Phoenicians, and Canaanites are words meaning a person (or item) from Phoenicia, Canaan, or Samaria. They are political terms.    A Jew is a person who is a member of the Jewish faith. Many people believe that in order to be a Jew, or Jewish, then one must be born to Jewish parents. This is false. One is able to convert to Judaism, like other religions, though it does require a lot of study, and some communities, especially smaller or more isolated communities, may be very insular and seem less open or friendly to converts.

Samaritans:  Biblically disdained by the Israelites, group of people that were of mixed blood, Israelite and Gentile.

Once you're not wound up about yourself, your reputation, how people look at you- all these things that relate to your tendency to be too careful- once those odd qualms start to disappear from your practices, you'll realize that you're overwoming shyness.    Start slow. Walk up to somebody, say, in a food court, and just get in his way and say, "F*** off B*tch!"    EDIT:  BEWARE! DO NOT BE A JERK IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS WITH PEOPLE YOU KNOW!

Fear is just not an option and it is a completely useless emotion. When you hesitate, act! Practice with a friend. Sit in front of eachother knees touching and look him in the eye as long as you can, without looking away or lauging. Try to look as long as needed to let the uncomfortable feeling subside. Then let him say hurtful things, like freak or geek. Keep looking him in the eye and train to preserve your inner balance. Do this also while he is saying nice things. Keep your balance regardless the actions of others. This is a very useful training. For making contact practice small talk at the bus stop or the mall. About any topic. They are expendable contacts.|`|AA11827342	i used to be likethis until i went to a drama class and pretended to be someone who wasn't shy and it stuck. shyness can also be a form of aggression as you make the other person do all the work and don't take any risks. remember everyone feels just like you do inside.|`|AA12329408	YOUR JUST 15 im glad i wasn't the only ,when i was your age i was realy shy too i couldnt even speak or go out and do shopping but i guess after when I was 16 and starting college I became a very confident person now I do a whole lot of talking which I never imagied you still so young when you grow older then your shyness will go and natually you enter adulthood and feel like doing something for yourself so dont worry it will pass as you get older you wont be in school forever you have to face different other things in life as you get older and thats what make you more confident.|`|c77185e72afe93c092747529a657094caa	that is what i am like, i am 14, i could only look at someone in the eyes for a few seconds but i am getting a bit more confident now because i've found something i like, sports like football and running, i am confident in these sports, you have just got to build confidence, remember you are as important as anyone else, get involved in more things including conversations, be more daring, build up looking at the person from a distance then getting closer and looking for longer, you will have to learn to talk to people over the phone - that will build confidence, just remember they cannot see you so there is nothing to worry about. are you confident with your looks - you have to be, build some muscle - i do with my brother - incline,decline and flat bemch press, preacher curls, barbell curls, deadlifts etc.  all this will be hard but you will soon be very confident i hope. good luck!!!|`|dfa51ed54d4cf13e9abe40220aac1594aa	Public speaking amongst peers at a social gathering helps. What you know of self is paramount, unless forced to show your hand, it's you and not for prying eyes, but then one is often required to compromise into todays rat race. Honestly stay shy if it aint misbehavin, it's an art of self.    Perhaps social-existence itself is problematic, society expects of you. A compromise is the best solution. Individuals that are painfully shy can overcome to become accepted and/ or societised, if searching, compromising and stronger mentally, but they lose comforting traits. Well must get over it without losing self, no!    It could be said that if you know where your coming from then you know where you are going. I know where i'm going, but I never had enough kicks and now is, well, all too late but as is expected, the resultant is a complex standoff.     Approach with caution, yet appear diligent, be forthright, be yourself. I'm not selling deoderant, calmess of mind is the key, showing both hands isn't obligatory, appear to show two hands, one can be kept behind for integrity and self.

AA10260693	None of this is associated with our beliefs and customs. Everything we do or say is from the bible. So why do so many say this?    Many, not all of your negative answers,  are from disfellowshipped or apostates, a disloyal person who betrays or deserts his cause or religion.    Let's take a "survey" and get the opinions (of people) by asking specific questions.    1. Were any of you ever a Jehovah's Witness?    2. Did you just decide to leave without a reason?    3. Was there a reason?    4. Were you disfellowshipped?    5. If you were disfellowshipped, for what reason?   Here are some reasons one can be removed from   the Congregation, please choose one or more.    Some of the offenses that could merit disfellowshipping from the Christian congregation are fornication, adultery, homosexuality, greed, extortion, thievery, lying, drunkenness, reviling, spiritism, murder, idolatry, apostasy, and the causing of divisions in the congregation.    6. Or is it just because you hate what we believe?    7. JW's are in 235 lands & islands, we respect the flag of each country unlike most christian religions, Why do you think, the prisons are full of so-called Christians, why is it that so-called Christians are the ones that "burn, spit, step on the "flag" and show disrespect not only to the flag but to the country they live in?  I can think of a President of the U.S.A. that saluted or said the pledge of allegiance every day, yet He had to leave office because of wrong doing, and the deliberate act of deviating from the truth. So the saluting and pledge is not what makes you a good person, it's obeying God's Word, that does.    8. Is it because of people that could care less about   God's rules that are layed out in the Bible, you   people have 3 things on your brain, Catholics,   Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses.    9. Why don't you people wise up and start acting like a   Christian, isn't that what most of you claim to be?    Has your minister, priest or religious leader mentioned this wonderful hope to you?  Of course they have not, most clergymen say nothing about it. In fact, many do not even believe the Bible. This is an important reason why Jehovahs witnesses call at the homes of people of other religions.    The efforts of Jehovahs witnesses to approach people in public and at their homes are rooted in the Word of God. Jesus himself went directly to the people, and he instructed his apostles and disciples to do likewise.     The Witnesses beliefs, based entirely on Gods Word, the Bible, prevent them from falling into the trap of becoming a sect or a cult. They take a kindly interest in all other people, of whatever religious persuasion. No, they do not try to force these people to change their viewpoint. They endeavor to imitate their Leader, Christ Jesus, by presenting Scriptural evidence of the trouble-free Paradise that will soon be established on earth.  Matthew 28:19, 20; 1 Peter 2:21.|`|AA11241707	Cults are small religions. Religions are small cults. I don't know how many people are Jehovah's Witnesses, so I don't know what category to put you in, but cults and religions are equal in my eyes. As I already stated, the only difference is population.     Note: This is based on U.S. Law definitions.|`|AA10066367	None of the following is made up, it is all clearly taught by the Watchtower Society (the Jehovahs Witnesses).  These teachings go against the basic premise of Christianity on so many levels that the JW's are considered a cult by just about every mainstream denomination.    **    In 1910 Russell wrote, "If anyone lays the Scripture Studies [short for a 7-volume WTS publication entitled Studies in the Scriptures, hereafter abbreviated as Studies] aside, even after he has used them, after he has become familiar with them, after he has read them for ten yearsif he lays them aside and ignores them and goes to the Bible alone, though he has understood the Bible for ten years, our experience shows that within two years he goes into darkness. On the other hand, if he had merely read the Scripture Studies with their references and had not read a page of the Bible, as such, he will be in the light at the end of two years . . . " (WT Reprints, 9-15-1910, 4685). The WTS maintains that it is Gods reliable mouthpiece to the nations, and it claims to be Gods inspired prophet (WT, 4-1-1972, 197)and yet its prophecies have repeatedly proven to be false. The only conclusion to be drawn is that the WTS is to be rejected as a false prophet.     Besides false prophesies, the WTS has misled its members through countless changes in doctrine and practice:     "To worship Christ in any form cannot be wrong ... " (WT, 3-1880, 83). "It is unscriptural for worshippers of the living and true God to render worship to the Son of God, Jesus Christ" (WT, 11-1-1964, 671).     The men of Sodom will be resurrected (WT, 7-1879, 7-8). The men of Sodom will not be resurrected (WT, 6-1-1952, 338). The men of Sodom will be resurrected (WT 8-1-1965, 479). The men of Sodom will not be resurrected (WT 6-1-1988, 31). The men of Sodom will be resurrected (Live Forever, early ed., 179). The men of Sodom will not be resurrected (Live Forever, later ed., 179). The men of Sodom will be resurrected (Insight on the Scriptures, Vol. 2, 985). The men of Sodom will not be resurrected (Revelation: Its Grand Climax at Hand! 273).     "There could be nothing against our consciences in going into the army" (WT, 4-15-1903, 120). Due to conscience, Jehovahs Witnesses must refuse military service (WT, 2-1-1951, 73).     "We may as well join in with the civilized world in celebrating the grand event [Christmas] . . . " (WT Reprints, 12-1-1904, 3468). "Christmas and its music are not from Jehovah . . . What is their source? . . . Satan the devil" (WT, 12-15-1983, 7).     "Everyone in America should take pleasure in displaying the American flag" (WT Reprints, 5-15-1917, 6068). The flag is "an idolatrous symbol" (Awake!, 9-8-71, 14).     A much longer list of such contradictions and doctrinal twists by the WTS could be formed, but this suffices to remove any reason one might have to believe that "It is through the columns of The Watchtower that Jehovah provides direction and constant scriptural counsel to his people . . . " (WT, 5-1-1964, 277). If that is the case, who is to say what will be taught tomorrow?     The New World Translation (NWT), the JWs own Bible version, was created between 1950-61 in several parts, beginning with New Testament (NT). The translation was made by an "anonymous" committee, which transliterated and altered passages that were problematic for earlier JWs. Nathan Knorr, Fred Franz, Albert Schroeder, George Gangas, and Milton Henschel were later identified as the men that created the text, which is used by no other sect. Franz studied non-biblical Greek for two years, and taught himself Hebrew. The rest had no formal training in any biblical language. The text of the NWT is more of a transliteration to fit theological presumptions than it is a true translation. This can be seen in key verses that the WTS changed in order to fit its doctrines.     To undermine the divinity of Christ in John 1:1, the NWT reads, " . . . the word was a god." Non-JW Greek scholars call this "a shocking mistranslation," "incorrect," "monstrous," and "evidence of abysmal ignorance of the basic tenets of Greek grammar." Furthermore, Col. 1:15-17 has been changed to "... by means of him all [other] things were created." If the text were left as the original Greek reads, it would clearly state that Jesus created all things. However, the WTS cannot afford to say that anyone but Jehovah created all things, so it inserted the word "other" four times into the text.     The 1950, 1961, and 1970 editions of the NWT said that Jesus was to be worshipped (Heb. 1:6), but the WTS changed the NWT so that later editions would support its doctrines. The translators now decided to render the Greek word for "worship" (proskuneo) as "do obeisance" every time it is applied to Jesus, but as "worship" when modifying Jehovah. If the translators were consistent, then Jesus would be given the worship due to God in Matthew. 14:33, 28:9, 28:17, Luke 24:52, John 9:38, and Hebrews 1:6.     At the time of the Last Supper, there were over three dozen Aramaic words to say "this means," "represents," or "signifies," but Jesus used none of them in his statement, "This is my body." Since the WTS denies the Catholic teaching on the Eucharist, they have taken the liberty to change our Lords words to "This means my body" in Matthew 26:26.     The NWT also translates the Greek word kurios ("Lord") as "Jehovah" dozens of times in the NT, despite the fact that the word "Jehovah" is never used by any NT author. It should also be asked why the NWT does not translate kurios as "Jehovah" in Romans 10:9, 1 Corinthians 12:3, Philippians 2:11, 2 Thessalonians 2:1, and Revelation 22:21. If it did translate kyrios consistently, then Jesus would be Jehovah!     Another mistake made by JWs is their denial of the immortality of the soul. The Bible mentions the soul appro|`|AA10684959	Because they skew the doctrine of Jesus to fit their own belief system, when the Bible is not for interpretation.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	Christianity is not a cult!

Anytime an organization wants to limited you in your actions or thinking that qualifies them as a cult.

I used to be a Jehovah's Witness also.  I joined the church because my birth mother was.  But there were still some things I didn't believe...I guess I just felt like that wasn't where I needed to be.  My step-mom and my siblings were Baptist, so I had to go to the Baptist church.  My youth minister actually had us make posters and do a project where we bashed other religions.  I didn't do it...my group did everything themselves.  I just sat to the side.  Then one of the groups was assigned Jehovah's Witness.  They said that Jehovah's witnesses think we're all going to die from meteor's hitting the earth.  I think they watched Armageddon and thought that that was the same Armageddon that we're talking about.  They watch too much TV and believe too much of what's written on the internet.  They said all sorts of things that were untrue about the religion, and it made me angry.  I left the classroom.  I still didn't go back to Kingdom Hall, just because I still didn't feel like that was where God wanted me to be.  I don't have anything against Jehovah's Witnesses or your beliefs.  In fact, it's somewhat similar to what we believe.  The main difference is that we have a prophet, and I guess that's why people think we're a cult  He is not our leader, though.  He is more like a messenger for God, just like Elijah, Moses, Noah, etc.  Why do people think that God showed Himself in the old days to all those people, but that He just suddenly gave up and one day and decided not to talk to us anymore?  It doesn't seem right.  I mean, how can you believe in God and worship Him but deny that He still uses some of us and physically talks to some of us?  He certainly can, and I know that He does.  I guess we just have to stand by our beliefs and ignore what others say about them and us.|`|2df62b129c1a848c5b5f53b87e8f9620aa	I am answering against my better judgement, because I really, really hate these types of arguments.    The short answer is that we DO believe JWs follow a charismatic leader:  Charles Taze Russell.  We DO believe JWs isolate themselves from friends, family and society -- but it's called "disfellowshipping" to a JW.  We DO believe JWs use deceptive, unethical and manipulative techniques to recruit and control members.  Here's a link that dramatically proves this assertion:  http://blueletterbible.org/study/cults/e...  You can see copies of actual Watchtower publications and other documents that PROVE the WTBS lies to members; you can also see that the WTBS qualifies as a "False Prophet" as defined by God, who commands us to turn away from your beliefs.|`|47db102ab899478cd52dc4a777588582aa	From what I have learned, Jehovahs Witnesses are classified as a cult because they have distorted the word of God by changing the teachings of Christ to fit their purpose. I challenge you to read the Bible and see how it conflicts with Jehovahs Witnesses. For this matter, I have seen the practices of Catholicism classified as a cult because they also distort the truths of the Bible to fit their purposes.|`|AA12357988	Because you guys are creepy cultists.|`|AA10025366	I'm sorry, but Jehovah's Witnesses are not only confused about the person of Jesus Christ, they mislead others.  Jesus, JW's say, is the archangel Michael.  They also do not believe in heaven, but paradise on earth.  The most obvious and well known blunder is the claim that JW's were the 144,000 mentioned in the bible.  After JW's outnumbered 144,000....they had to come up with an excuse for that misinterpretation.    JW's do not follow biblical teachings.....they follow the interpretation of a group of people who publish what is called "The Watchtower".  Also, JW's disfellowship any who turn from their teachings.  I have always said, if a church (or whatever JW's call themselves) tells you that if you leave their particular denomination, you are no longer saved, turn and run from them as fast as you can.|`|AA12264300	ALL ARE CULTS!|`|0eed39a026b3bdafe1a244d7c85be399aa	Because they are Christians.

AA11054766	i think you should bear in mind..that just because you ask for something.. does not mean that is what GOD has in mind for you.  we dont always ask for the right things.. and GOD might have a better plan.  people keep making the mistake that everything they ask for will be granted..and if it isnt..then there is no GOD.  that is not true. also GOD may not move as fast as you want... but he/she is always on time.|`|AA10025366	Excuse me...but this sounds very much like the "name it and claim it" teaching.  This is a gross misinterpretation of scripture.    When the bible says ask and you shall receive, it doesn't mean we come with our grocery list and demand exactly what we want.  Our example is Jesus.  In the Garden of Gethsemene, He asked the Father to let the cup pass from Him.  But then what did He say?  "Not my will, but yours".  If you bring your requests before God, which we are to do, but then say to God....nevertheless your will, not mine...you will never be left tapping your foot waiting for something.  God will bring into your life...or not....whatever He chooses for your growth, to be made into the image of His son.|`|AA11991510	God answers when it best. And also God won't answer if it's best. God knows the big picture.     also, it seems you're doing a lot of asking, you might need to try the giving side.|`|464246167e063a36ae45264fefbb8d4aaa	Look for anything that is wrong about your life and try to ask harder and be faithful. God says: ask and you shall find, but he also commands us to pray without ceasing and to abide in his words that we may be bless. Dig each day in the Bible to look for truth and don't give up. That is my advice to you.|`|20ee929bc106cdeb2830ffdb7df31d78aa	I use to wonder and worry why my prayers werent being answered alsoWhat Ive realized was that my prayers have already been answered. Sometimes we have to be still and know that He is God. Its kind of like Mary, she was looking for Jesus in the tomb but he was standing outside of it talking to her (basically right in front of her) all the whilebut she didnt recognize himbe blessed!|`|AA10247918	Let's look at your self image...you use the word "moron" in your user name; you use the word "obedient"; the word "obedient" in this case means knowing how the law of mind works.  Always remember that what words mean to you makes a big difference in your demonstrating your affirmations.  It is about belief, but it is about the conviction you have behind the words you use.  Also, how do you feel about what you're affirming?  Is it something that could potentially intrude upon someone else's good? Or is it something that could do potential harm to you?      I would back up, and just look at these things, and whatever you can think of.  The power of mind is ordered, and you (the whole of you) call the shots as far as your own life is concerned.  But if your life in general seems chaotic, or in disorder, put the affirmations on hold, meditate on the things I mentioned, plus what you come up with.    You might be blocking your reception of your desired good; once we "try", instead of know, it causes us to tense up, and exert effort...there is no effort in mind.  So be still, know that you are all your needs met, right now.      Your refusal to give up is excellent.  Just bring your faith level up; read whatever books inspire you, or go somewhere you love to be, and allow yourself to be everything that you are: perfectly loved forever, by perfect Love.  Peace.|`|AA10986153	Perhaps you're looking for the God that you EXPECT.  That's a lot of guess work.  If you leave yourself open to God, whatever the definition of that power might be, you have some chance of finding it.  The biggest argument I get into with traditional believers is that they are caught up on details.  Will God destroy us because we fail to guess a riddle?  How ridiculous!  You don't find anything by closing your eyes and visualising it.  You find it by opening your eyes and seeing what is actually there.  That takes acceptance.|`|AA11656831	A way out of reality... that is what spiritual realms offer. Thats why the religion thing works, because a lot of people hate their life and then follow some word of a guy and things get better because they believe full heartedly that something good will happen and then they begin to look for it and there it is.    Placebo effect|`|da8fc8fa359e667e9c09f2a3ff14f0dcaa	Sweet pea, I want nothing more than to encourage you.  but you have to remember that God knows better than we do.  ask away, He always answers.  but sometimes those answers aren't what we expect.  what's important is your faith, and the God who is faithful.  He will never ever fail you.

94e06f303abe6b4931072dce118ae3e8aa	Remember my dear mate!  God is within us.  He is inside you.  Will you not want the God within you to be happy for the reason that you like skating but you fear that it would come between you and the God?  Do what brings you Happiness for it will pass on the happiness to your God who resides within you.     Between we humans and animals, the difference is the power to think. But amonst all humans the difference lies in our intentions and actions.  Anyone with negative intentions is bound to hurt others and thus in turn God, while those with good intentions always serve god thus making him Happy.  The bad or good intentions are decided by our thoughts i.e., the power to think negative or positive.  And our thoughts take the shape of our actions that world can see.    If you have a positive thought process, do not let hurdles in your mind like God would be unhappy if you skate, to rule your thoughts.  You are still not in control of your mind, i.e., your senses and that is the reason why these hurdles block your happiness.    Meditate well and regularly to beat this wayward mind to meet your super self, i.e., God.    Thanks!|`|bd861129d3433f1d5311b4b620b0955eaa	Shouldn't you be in bed??

6b992d40e593b6d718fc687f2a684453aa	So not only is God not perfect, she must have a sick fetish for torturing people.  Otherwise, why would she create people who live anyplace other than Europe or America, since those people are not likely to believe in her?|`|AA11202252	To want is not the same as to need.  God wants us to be with Him in our eternal life.    Since God "wants"... he wanted to create the word... his purpose?, to magnify His Glory... he doesn't need our prays...but he wants them...    As you said: "He is perfect", he doesn't need anything from anybody... but He wants to save us...    I hope this short message could help a little...    Tsch?!!!|`|3a8f4a74a15b60554e8e1a8074af056faa	I think your definitions limit your answers.   "Perfection entails the lack of needs or wants."  What if God "wanted" to display His glory...  and besides, God isn't perfect. God is God...He is wholly unique in His being.   There are some things He cannot do:  1. He cannot be evil,   "God is Light (good), and in Him there is no darkness(evil) at all."  I John 1:5   Look at the context for light and darkness as good and evil.    2.There are several "logical" problems that cannot be.   e.g.-Can God create a rock so big He can't lift it. No. Then how is He God?   these don't really prove anything except that you can play games with logic.     conclusion: God isn't trying to be perfect. God is God. "I AM THAT I AM.-Exodus 3:14  Creation is meant for you to see God in it. It is there to display His glory...even things no human will ever see.   e.g.-There are fish in the deepest depths of the ocean, that no human, can see or appreciate (we have pictures from diving robots) that are majestic in their beauty...ones with little dangling lights on their heads...stuff like that. Just so God can appreciate His own glory. God loves God more than anything else.|`|e4199b09dff471ac0e7d450f20ea2795aa	If God can do anything then He can create a desire that will only be fulfilled through his creation.|`|f56e82715b1eb5d2bd765ff49d7dc8ffaa	While you make a good effort, I'm not sure we can justify the following : "Perfection entails the lack of needs or wants."    Does perfection really entail a lack of need or want ... a lack of desire?  I think we need additional evidence to satisfy this portion of the argument.|`|AA11478382	Your "logic" is full of holes.  You took insupportable steps in claiming that perfection entails the lack of needs or wants, and that deliberate creation entails an effort to satisfy some need or want.  God has Will; not want.  A being that fit your faulty definition of "perfection" would be incapable of making a choice or, indeed, of doing anything at all.  And what was that scrap of carelessness at the end: "God wouldn't bother"?  Presumptuous of you to second-guess Him.|`|AA10025366	I made a comment on a similar "question" earlier.  You can string together any number of statements and come to a conclusion...that will not render that conclusion true.    If you want to understand God's true nature, and I mean this in all friendship...please open the bible and read.  It will be revealed to you there.    Best wishes.|`|8f4f74b888ea52c3281d7e660fc03550aa	Good logic, pass the bong|`|8fe50de8768954c2561dcb7eaccfe3d1aa	God is not limited by time or space like we are, nor by our feeble (and disordered) intellects.
dd056b27ff2911fdd4536f24b3a7eb77aa	I don't think this guy is saying that the KKK is good at all, he's making a hypothetical comparison. It's sort of like how it is "politically incorrect" to profile muslims/Middle Eastern people in airports. Liberals denounce this as an imposition on civil liberties. But by that standard, some quack in a white sheet COULD NOT be stopped in an airport just as a person of Middle Eastern decent could not be stopped without some other evidence of ill will. What I think (THINK) he's trying to illustrate is that too much political correctness could end up protecting things we don't want (white supremicist organizations). PS-Lay off this dude, I'm pretty sure he's not IN THE KKK.|`|AA11151460	Liberals will always find something to complain about and something wrong with everything.

If you're implying that liberals are for everyone and everything, no matter what the moral implications..then you are a right wing conservative IDIOT! You need to learn your history before you go shooting off your mouth and showing everyone what a fool you are.|`|AA12040539	This question doesn't even make sense. What do liberals have to do with the KKK?     Having a God, a prophet and a book would not give the KKK any right to discriminate black people. It would not provide any forgiveness for all the s.hit they caused back in the days of lynching and cross burning.     I can't even write anymore. It's been so hard to put the words together, because this question is so insane. I can't tell if you are making up this example based off the events of history, like the crusades, or if you are just taking a weird route to saying something bad about liberals.|`|96f79e9fbf3bc2a563f791c5c043de78aa	As a recognized religion or not, there is really nothing good to say about the KKK.|`|AA11491405	Any religion that promotes the violent deaths of those who do not agree with them is not a religion, but a terrorist cult.    As we all know, there is no such thing as a "moderate" Klansman.

On what grounds?    Islam isn't any more bigoted than Christianity. It just depends on how you look at them. There are crazy extremists in both religions as well as "moderate" people.     The KKK was built on hate. Whether they had a god, prophet, and book wouldn't make a difference. It's all hateful.
AA11539308	People think too much about being "Hot." And aren't you kind of tired of being told (by ads, movies, etc) how "hot" is supposed to look? And what is that anyway- someone you want to be romantic with, or what? (Ok, I'm not saying all this because I'm afraid I'm not "hot"!) I just think it might be a good idea for people to put more energy into being good on the inside. My grandmother, a real "hottie" in her time, always said, "Pretty is as pretty does."

bb185e598250c40fdf7b05b816ed4cf5aa	Anyone with any common sense knows Dec. 25 is not Christs birthday. The early church incorporated pagan holidays to bring them to the church [right or wrong] so it became the official day of celebration.

AA11472742	You have made an error.  You assume equal rights is only a matter of skin color.  I can understand why you might think that way.  You are, however, incorrect.    Equal rights,  are just that  EQUAL RIGHTS.    Equal rights should be your fight...  no matter who the offended party is.    If some white people hadn't fought for YOUR cause, you would still be picking cotton.     I am glad all white people didn't have your attitude when your grandfather and great grandfather fought for THEIR equal rights.    Equal rights is a matter for ALL people, not just the ones that are being discriminated against.    The way we all will RETAIN equal rights is to continue fighting for ALL people to have equal rights.  When we say discrimination is ok for one thing... it sets precedent for discrimination everywhere.    Take a step outside your little world for a moment and see things from a broader perspective.  It will help you in all areas of your life.|`|62d13184392cb6c0f6cbed0fa25ba304aa	This has been discussed many times here. civil rights are civil rights.

Also having a hate crime law on the books doesn't make the person less dead. I am not trying to get you riled up, but I hope that was not your intent by posting this here.   Live and let live if it offends you then be offended but please don't try to make us defend ourselves because you are upset about something someone said on the street. OK    Edit sorry didn't mean to imply that you where being insensitive. I know that as a Native American/Caucasian mix that I have no idea what it is like to be a black man just like as a straight man you have no idea what it is like to be bisexual or homosexual.     I meant to only say that discrimination is discrimination regardless of the reasons for it.      I do not mean to imply that the discrimination in this country toward homosexual is as bad as the racism toward blacks once was. In the USA as bad as discrimination against homosexuals is it is not as bad as Saudi Arabia where you can be put to death just for being homosexual.|`|5527c12b931cff044d211bcdb9d00c0daa	Gay marriage and gay equality is a fight just as your ancestors went through. When your ancestors were slaves they were not allowed to wed, or have choices regarding death, religion and so forth. This was decided by their owner on how much freedom they had. They were beaten if they attempted to speak out. It took them generations, lots of lost lives and many battles in the courts to change their standing. They wanted equality. Martin Luther King's wanted equality for all men. His widow was on of the strong proponents for Gay rights till she died.    She as many others understand we are being beaten and killed. We are being unfairly taxed and don't even have the right to visit our loved ones in a hospital if their family decides they don't want us there. We can not bury our loved ones or even attend a burial if their family decides this as well. How would you fell if the person you loved died and you could not attend their funeral.    We can not adopt in most states, we can not marry in most states. Up until recently most states did not even protect us from hate crimes. Most states still do not have laws to protect us against discrimination even at the work place. Does all of this sound familiar. It is the same problems your ancestors had in the past. We only want equality nothing more.    For the record. Gays have been killed for being gay through out history. just ask those who were held just like the jews in concentration camps.|`|c33dd2433bbef459139cf1b6393ee0c5aa	at the end of the day it all comes down to equality.

And since y'all have invested all of your political capital in the idea of "black people as perpetual victims" you get offended at the idea that someone else may have had it bad.    So rest assured that no one, ever, has been victimized as badly as you, and since nothing compares to the heart wrenching (sob sob) black experience, you can ignore anyone who hasn't had it as bad.  You can sit on your hands and not do anything about other social problems.  You can remain an ostrich with your head selfishly in the sand for all eternity.    If it weren't for white liberals you'd all still be in chains anyway, so why worry about other people, you selfish cretin?|`|475b59b117722a097fa674c3c4e07a2daa	Both groups are discriminated against, and have had to put up with ignorance and hates crimes.

I also dislike it when people tell me what I "should" think as a bi person or as a woman.      If you had time, I'd tell you that this can touch your world, if a friend or a relative comes out.  I'd tell you that nobody wants to keep you from marrying.  I'd explain that adult citizens have the right to find someone to care for, who cares for them, and to trust their bodies and property with the person of their choice.

You (seem to) be a black male, I'm a bisexual Wiccan female.  You get the sh*t stick on race, I get it on sexual orientation and religion.  As people who gets treated shitty by majority groups on a regular basis, we both know how much it sucks.  We don't have the excuse (or privledge) of not having to see racism or heterosexism or religious discrimination.    We see it because we have to see.  We see it because it affect us.    Which is why I think we have more responsiblity then the average straight upper class  white Christian male to fight oppression against ALL, because we know what it feels like.      If you disagree, you disagree.  But I feel like its pretty shitty of you to say "not my fight".  Who gives a sh*t whose fight it is?

And I wouldn't dream of removing that entitlement from you.    You can see it as crass or (justifiably) not equivalent to the struggle your forbears went through and fought for.      There is a similarity between the two - equal rights to be afforded to a minority population.  Perhaps this is what the petition guy was alluding to?

9439a0592fb86bfcaccf331488de9c3aaa	There is no cut and dried way to answer what you wish to know. But generally speaking, Christian biblical interpretations are highly dependent on the spiritual base of the person doing the interpreting who, in turn, wouldn't probably accept teachings except from someone with the same tradition of thinking. If you go back enough in time or thinking you'll find that, ultimately, each teaching started with someone who had some type of agenda, usually political and financial in the Roman Empire. Romans established Christianity as state religion. But that doesn't answer the differences in biblical interpretation between Christians. The Christian church was pretty much monolithic until Martin Luther and the ensuing Reformation, in which others also participated. Luther and other reformers resented the authority of Catholic clergy and wondered how come intermediaries were needed to be in contact with God. So they decided that humans could directly contact God by directly and literally interpreting the Bible as the unadulterated word of God. Of course, that argument missed the point that the Bible is really a compilation of books from different eras and by different authors from different backgrounds and that it was put together by an all too human team of theologians (Council of Nicaea,  first few centuries AD). That's where the concept of faith was brought to bear on all this: Faith is what tells fundamentalist Christians that the Bible is literally true and tells Catholics that it requires interpretation. To summarize, there's no definite scientific answer to your question, but history sheds some light on possible partial answers.|`|AA11601987	Some Christians believe the Bible is literal and some would agree with your statement. Some passages, given the context of the times and literary environment in which they were written, seem more likely to be allegorical. For example, the Revelation is filled with metaphorical imagery, but some is literal as well. And, yes, there are many works that debate this very topic, which one might compile into a "bible bibliography."    As for me and my family, we will follow the Lord . . . May God bless and keep you.|`|c422593c6b166f129b3a7f326fa26cf4aa	Its called "Hermeneutics", the study of "How to study the Bible". Some of the Bible is History, some  Prophecy, some parable, some literal, some metaphorical. If you don't know the difference-you can get lost. These courses can be taken in Bible college or seminary. It a tough study.|`|AA12091707	Because with all the interpretations and translations, no one can really be sure what any of it means, for sure. I'd like to think that God takes this into account. Many people seek him, wholeheartedly and end up in different places. Why? Because ( and here's the controversial part) Either way, you have to pass man in order to gain your understanding of the word. Not just ministers. People say that all you have to do is trust God but how can you trust yourself to trust him? We're not perfect. Therefore, our interpretation may not be, either.|`|d18139610232944c9d423a7d2395c7e7aa	Well, the bible contains different kinds of literature.  Some is literal, and some is figurative.  The best thing to do is to take a literary view of the bible.  Determine which kind of literature a given passage is, and go from there.      For example, in Isaiah there is a phrase that says "The trees clap their hands."  Obviously, this is a figurative and poetic phrase.    In the New Testament, when it says, "Paul held discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrranus" that is obviously literal.      These are two simple examples, but you get the idea.    Additionally, it helps to know what the bible actually teaches, and what it does not.  For example, it was determined by some famous bishop that the earth was created in the year 4004 BC or thereabouts.  His determination was based on his study of the geneaologies of the bible.      Unfortunately for him, the geneaologies in the bible are incomplete, and there is NO WAY of determining the age of creation with the information given in the bible.  However, this idea has persisted, and people unfamiliar with the bible dismiss the whole thing because some hold that the earth is 6000 years old.  But that notion is not found in the bible.      So it becomes quite a mess, if one is not careful to know what one is talking about before one opens one's big yapper.      Love, Jack|`|fceb8e8d32e6a43f6a5152d4d855ada5aa	to know and to believe are two different things. How does WHO "know" this? Do you know what all christians believe OR know? What way, do YOU think the word of God is really meant? Or did you forget to read that book? What authority? Is it not natural or "authorized" for everyone to have beleifs, opinions, or knowledge? You certainly seem to think you have that authority - where did you get yours? And foremost how can YOU be so arrogant, to be condescending of a people, their beliefs, knowledge and attitude while simotaneously stating that you have no idea what you're writing, thinking, stating and asking.

The bible communicates with us in several different ways.  Much of it is literal, yes.  But then you also have metaphors, symbolism, parables (which Jesus used alot), etc.    May I give you a for instance?  Jesus said, about sin, that it's better to cut off your hand or gouge out your eye than (to let sin tempt you).  Now, did He mean literally to do this?  Doubtful.  Most people would be walking around eyeless and handless.  This is called hyperbole...it is exaggeration for the purpose of making a point.    It's not arrogant to be able to "rightly divide the word of truth".  It's something that is learned by studying it.  I'm not saying everything I think is right...but in studying the bible for many, many years, I do think I've got a good understanding of its meaning.    Hope this helps you.|`|618783bb3688632e3fa1d8194cbf4c02aa	Its a way to conviently explain away the things that are either; a) no longer valid, b) too tough to actually adhere too, or c) are blatant contradictions to things elsewhere in the bible.|`|AA11623828	The Holy Spirit.

(b) Some events/declarations made in the Bible are not desired ... at least by those making the claim of needing interpretation ... and it allows them to be excluded, thus they only need to live by the rules they declare valid.|`|AA10889746	The answer is that it is entirely dependent on how much reason a person allows into their thinking.    The more a person introduces reason ("a 6,000 year old earth is just implausible given the proof") the more they view it figuratively.  Some even make it all figurative, except for a handful of miracles like the resurrection.    There is no objective basis to decided "where" reason ends and faith begins.  Most people (but amazingly, not all) think there should be at least some reason introduced, which is where moderates come from.  I personally think reason is paramount, and should not be second to ideas of fancy.  That is probably the major reason why I don't believe in the bible anymore.    Nevertheless, there is no good answer to your question.  Its simple a matter of at which points in the bible do folks put their thinking cap on, and at which points to they take it off.
AA10564932	Anything that leads to danger is bad. Drinking alcohol may lead to something serious so as a Christian, you'd rather not. A little would mean too much as you don't know how far you'll go when you start doing something. Besides, being a Christian means that you are following Christ. If you drink whether you go little or too much doesn't show being a Christian of you.     There is a so-called Christian society and another which is that of human. A Christian society lives in God and not in vain. A society that is free is a society outside Christianity. There are many things prohibited by the Christian Society. If you tend to do things especially unlikely ones, you are outside the society of Christians because you want to live the freer way.|`|6c16f0022337b959fc943a45a9dde8c3aa	Yes, but not to excess.

AA11394576	I'd encourage you to think about looking at some of the closer in suburbs-- particularly Oak Park and Forest Park.      In the city anything around the end of the Brown line is worth looking at.  The nieghborhood is iffy but coming up.  Rogers Park is okay in sections.  (I live in RP.)  Try to stay near the lakeshore or right along Ridge.  Farther away from Howard Street is definitely better and near busier streets is definitely safer for you and your property.  Ravenswood and Ravenswood Manor are great rental neighborhoods but maybe too expensive to buy.  Logan Square is coming up.      Could you look at townhouses?  Then you could definitely find some affordable options out near O'Hare.  Inside the city you'll have to spend $200,000 plus for any house in any neighborhood.|`|21c79b39ba59502428a118ecc2969c42aa	Id say look at the Gold Coast, but its kindof expensive so you might wanna try the neighborhoods north of the, like rogers park or one of the surrounding neighborhoods.

425fca3256730fe3dbca29ae58671ec3aa	2 Peter 2:4Certainly if God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned, but, by throwing them into Tar'tar-rus, delivered them to pits of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment; 5 and he did not hold back from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a deluge upon a world of ungodly people 6 and by reducing the cities of Sod'om and Go-mor'rah to ashes he condemned them, setting a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come; So no they cannot repent, there judgment has been set.|`|AA10025366	If you turn to the book of Revelation...which is a book about things to come, you'll see the devil and his angels will be pitched into the lake of fire.

The bible is like one very, very long movie.  Revelation is merely revealing what is to come.  It will surely happen, just as it states.|`|AA11064207	It sounds to me like you already know the answer.|`|AA11805224	The bible says that hell was created for the devil and his angels, so I would surmise they do not get another chance.

Angels aren't part of God, or made in His image, like we humans are.  Angels have no free will, they are just God's tools.|`|203c7130e7ae5ec30b60dde276fb521baa	No they cannot. They were created perfect spirit creatures "with" freewill.       The Apostle Peter provides from the Scriptures warning examples. First, he writes: God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned. These, Jude says, did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place in heaven. They came to earth before the Flood and took on fleshly bodies so as to engage in sexual relations with the daughters of men. As punishment for their improper, unnatural conduct, they were thrown into Tartarus, or as Judes account says, they were reserved with eternal bonds under dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.2?Peter 2:4; Jude?6; Genesis 6:1-3.    These disobedient angels, or demons, have Satan the Devil as their ruler. (Matthew 12:24-26) This wicked angel rebelled against his Creator and challenged the rightfulness of Gods sovereignty. Satan led our first parents into sin, and this resulted in their eventual death. (Genesis 3:1-7, 17-19) Although God permitted Satan to have access to heavenly courts for a period thereafter, the Bible book of Revelation foretold that in Gods due time, this wicked one would be cast down to the vicinity of the earth. Eventually, the Devil and his demons will go into everlasting destruction. With the issue of sovereignty finally resolved, the account for rebellion will then have been justly settled.Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Revelation 12:7-9; 20:10.    There are plenty of scriptures there. But  again in case you didn't catch it, here is a definition of Tartarus:  According to Jude?6, those spirits were the angels that did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place in the heavens. They took on fleshly bodies in order to enjoy illicit sex relations with women. When the Deluge compelled those angels to return to the spirit realm, they were thrown into Tartarus, a condition of utter debasement. (2?Peter 2:4) (" Certainly if God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned, but, by throwing them into Tartarus, delivered them to pits of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment.") The resurrected Jesus preached to them. But was that a message of salvation? Definitely not! Rather, Jesus condemned their wickedness as being the very antithesis of godly devotion.|`|cb80538236872475fc58f85feaba2c62aa	No, the fallen angels rejected god's grace, assuming you even own a bible you would know this.  Humans can be forgiven for earthly sins, they can not be forgiving for rejecting god's grace, ever, no one can.|`|98cf507aa80271fa8ebdb192d7ca2b8faa	No fallen angels can't get up unless they are lucky enough to have bought the life alert system to ask for help.|`|2bd69b22a852f6cc5b9638183506eebcaa	If the angels were to be forgiven, they'd have to be forgiven in the same way as God forgives humans:  by sending them a Savior who would partake in the nature of angels and die for their sins.  Two problems, though:  angels don't die, and angels don't have angel kids.  So there isn't any way for God to enter into the angelic race as a Savior for fallen angels.

You can have innate talent and not be Wiccan.  Conversely, a Wiccan can have no talent and still follow the path.    And proof?  I don't need to prove to anyone what I am and what I am not able to do.  I serve the Gods.|`|AA11489641	it depends on what your idea of a "spell" is and what your expectations are.  if you're expecting movie or cartoon type stuff, you'll be seriously disappointed.    spells, like prayers, work for some and not for others.  and most of it is dependent on the person doing it and how they do it.  many sabotage their own efforts because they have no clue about the principles behind it, what makes it work.    you can do stuff as a non wiccan that seems to be what the wiccans should be able to do because you seem to know what to do, whether you realize it or not.    it's not about your religion, it's about knowing the principles.  magick is science to me.  call it magick, call it prayer, call it will power, call it what you want, all the same to me.    your desired result, your desired target, add energy, release.  the rest is dependent on the scenario.  if you do that wanting to destroy the world but there are millions of others who want the world to be safe, then you got outvoted.|`|b544a2f15d3e56d861aa53e6413067abaa	Wow..seems that you lack understanding and education.

That same error remains to this day.

God exists, He does give the Plan as He incessantly does (not did) from eternity to eternity.  Please seek for Him and seek for His Plan. The Plan is ready for all mankind, but the man who refuses to seek, how can he gets that Plan for salvation; and even he has got the Plan, but he doesn't move a finger for its realization, how can he expect anything new for him or for other people? Please think the unthinkable and rethink the thinkable.|`|e579f7b2d68ee47df1a7268c2b0c8148aa	Technology has aided society to become less connected and more distant than ever before in world history. It is easier to talk to people when you do not have to see their faces and also it is easier to be mean to people as well. I see people letting themselves be morally, spiritually and emotionally raped by technology.     It is easier for society to interact with a machine that will not challenge them emotionally, spiritually and physically. Techonology, in and of itself is not bad, but how people  are consumed by its power is. Part of the technology problem is that the coming of  the "anti-christ". It is through the people currently in power and there is an elite group called the "Illuminati"' which is making technology seem like a wonder. When in reality it is being used against all of us using it. We are being tracked by every piece of technology that we use. So, some of it has a "clouding affect'' on us.|`|AA12269369	more connected, cause well, like u said, we have a lot more technology. in the community, some people still go 2 neiborhood events and church and stuff, so they still r, i guess.

As for the rest of us, if we live by God's will and want to do what is right and have a good heart, he is going to destroy the evil and make the earth a beautiful paradise as it was in the beginning, where we will live in peace and harmony, as most of us wish for.  Now all we have to do is get there!  Its going to be hard, very hard, but totally worth it in the end.  Crystal clear rivers and oceans, green lush grass as far as the eye can see, clear blue sky, no more sickness or pain.  It may seem like only a dream, but if you study the bible, u will see there are greater plans for the earth then what we have made of it.  You should speak with Jehovah's Witnesses.

I hope so.    As for not liking what goes on these days - I agree.  It's hard these days to get a good job with good people. Things haven't changed.  The Medieval poet Chaucer wrote "This world is but a thoroughfare full of woe, and we be pilgrims passing to and fro, joy after woe and woe after gladfulness." (from the Knight's Tale/Canterbury Tales).      Yet, we all have to do the best that we can and try to find that place where we should be.  And it's not easy. Not for anyone.

Of course every religion thinks it is the true religion; if the followers of a certain religion thought it was a false religion, why would they continue in it?    It comes down to, "what does a certain religion teach about other religions?"  Some (like Bahai and Hinduism) teach that some truth was taught to different people in different places, and anything called truth must be truth.  Some (like Christianity) teach that there is only one way, and every other way must (logically) be incorrect.    In the US, the government cannot tell somebody that their religion is wrong; that doesn't mean that it is right.  Only God can dictate what His followers should do to worship Him.|`|fa149a85977db316dcf09012f49507b1aa	The founders make up hell to scare people into joining. So they do, then they see another culture who did the same with a different religion. Based on the teachings, and the churches quest for power, they must fight. The people do, because you hate to be wrong when it comes to what god you worship. The loser has the false god, and everyone converts. Like a preliminary horse race, to see what one you bet on. It helps people get it correct before they die. It is like the movie highlander, there can be only one so they destroy each other.

Religion is a man made thing.  The Bible is the only source of information for how we are really supposed to conduct ourselves and the only guide for true teaching.  But you have to read the entire Bible.  You can't just read a couple of verses and go on your way.  That is not accurate knowledge.  That's why religions fight over who is right and who is wrong and then end up in holy wars.  It's not God saying that they need to go to war. Jesus teaches us in the New Testament that we need to be tolerant of one another.  Breaking out in war is not being tolerant. We aren't supposed to kill one another because we don't agree about it.|`|68c972ad485404de74e897aeb9129ce3aa	It's all about politics and power.|`|41fcfaa4d28e0412033c9ea39023290caa	Have you ever seen Dogma?  Well, anyway, everyone wants to be right, and everyone wants power and affluence.  Everyone wants to save everyone else, and not for the simple goodness of "saving" them, but to have more people converted to them, to have more power for them.  Everyone strives for power, be it political, cultural, or universal.  Plus, it's in human nature to be arrogant, conceited, vain, and live life with the fact that they know the true religion, which is ironic, because there really isn't one.  Plus, everyone thinks religion is about what happens when you die, but it's more about how it affects you in life.

Founded in New York City (1966) by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (18961977), the movement was based upon the philosophy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (14861533). He taught that the Hindu god Krishna is the supreme personal God. The movement practices an ascetic lifestyle, vegetarianism, and devotion to the Hindu god Krishna as a means of attaining spiritual enlightenment, particularly through the practice of chanting the mantra Hare Krishna [O Lord Krishna]. The movement has spread to other U.S. cities and to England, Australia, Latin America, and India    In america uner the leadership of Anuttama Prabhu the ISKCON Movement has gained much popularity presently. Anuttama Prabhu is a religious leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In 1976 he was initiated by Srila Prabhupada and since 1993, Anuttama has served as Director of Communications for ISKCON in North America. He is also a member of the Governing Body Commission. He is well-known for his ability to prepare excellent "sweet rice" for offering to Krishna and distributing as prasad.

But in the same way if I say there IS gold in china, I only need to find one piece to substanciate my claim.     So even if an athiest knew 1% of everything there is to know, which is a very high percentage, there is still 99% of creation that they don't know about, and there is a good chance that there is ample evidence of God in that 99%. An athiest can't say "There is no God" when they have such a limited knowledge about all there is to know.

Ora i soldi o li usi per dare da mangiare ai poveri a casa tua o per uccidere e depredare fuori casa. Vedi tu chi ha cominciato per primo a ragionare cosi`. Prima di generalizzare e dire che e` solo l'occidente a tenere miliardi di individui nella poverta`, prova anche a riflettere dove sono finiti tutti i miliardi che l'occidente ha pagato per portarsi a casa il petrolio. E dicono che in qualche paese arabo non si pagano neanche le tasse. E si dice che i poveri si tolgono il pane dalla bocca per finanziare Bin Laden. E` in nome della poverta` del suo popolo o la poverta` e` un pretesto per imporre la sua bislacca ideologia religiosa? Perche` le bombe non se le lancia a casa sua? Se il petrolio crede che sia tutto suo, perche` non se lo beve da solo? Che diritto ha lui, neanche eletto dal popolo, di rappresentare il popolo con bombe e morti innocenti? Prima si metta in democrazia a casa sua e poi venga a dire che la democrazia non funziona ! Ascolta bene i suoi discorsi e mettili sulla bilancia dello psicologo: l'occidente, prima di essere usurpatore, e` cane di infedele davanti a Dio, per lui! Auguri alla sua mentalita`.Certo, lui ha il diritto di proibire la liberta` di religione a casa sua, e di mandare i suoi poveri a cercare scampo in occidente. Ma l'occidente spero e prego che tenga i nervi a posto e non arrivi a occhio per occhio, con l'eccidio di tanti innocenti. E se l'occidente si stufa di porgere l'altra guancia, allora e` terrorista? Dove sta scritto che tocca sempre all'occidente dare da mangiare anche ai poveri sulle montagne del terrorismo? Spero che Bin Laden non sia come il lupo di Gubbio, che la testa per dare da mangiare al suo branco non l'aveva ( i soldi, se vuole ne ha tanti). Da quando l'uomo si e` autoconvinto che fare il terrorista e` colpa degli altri? Da quando tu ti sei autoconvinto che devi gestire la testa di un terrorista, altrimenti diventa un terrorista? Io penso alle due facce del male, e la mia povera conclusione e` che ognuno ha sufficiente cervello per darsi le colpe che merita. Se Bin Laden ha ragione di fare il terrorista, non sia vigliacco. Scenda dal monte e vada a colpire dove ritiene giusto. Mentre mi sembra che usi innocenti come scudo umano e dopo piange quando arabi innocenti vengono coinvolti nei sassi che lancia. Quando si semina odio e zizzania, si raccoglie grandine e tempesta. Sara` un proverbio bislacco, ma vale per entrambi i fronti: addestrare all'odio e` terrorismo. I popoli tenuti in poverta` non necessariamente e` colpa dell'occidente. Ma nessuno vieta a generosi occidentali di portare tutte le loro sostanze a Bin Laden per la distribuzione ai poveri.|`|49d10f9ad27a582ba54ea8b13e043f6daa	terrorista A s. m.  e f.

I assume you are female but I cant be too sure.    I am not into anal but I can't imagine you having a problem finding a bisexual man willing to fill this spot. Most people wantign to swing want females only, So you should have no problems just post and add in most personal sites you can find many people willing to travel to get some of this type action.   A gay man might have problems with it so advertise for a bisexual man.|`|AA12363172	It is difficult but not impossible.  Where are you looking?  If you're putting up an ad at a local sex shop that is the wrong place entirely.  Is there a fetish or BDSM event in your area? If so, attend. And attend often. That is where you will meet people who are not only in the lifestyle, but sincere about it.  I reccomend buying the excellent book "Screw the roses, send me the thorns" and get educated on the subject.  Enjoy the journey.|`|5527c12b931cff044d211bcdb9d00c0daa	I am sure you can find a person to meet your needs on any number of personall ad sites. Look there, no there.

I would never do threesomes because: 1. I'm jealous and I know what's mine.  2.  There's the possibility of one of you getting left out of the equation during sex.  One person always likes another better than the third.  Now, I would hate it for my boyfriend to start liking to be in bed with someone else more than with me.    Never, ever share.  Oh, and to answer your question, yes, you can find one.  Just check out gay.com or craigslist--lots of people willing to do anything in those sites.

Eventually I decided I needn't be doing that, so I closed those email addresses to avoid the temptation of logging in and looking at them.  Perhaps you could think about doing the same (whatever you meant by "sick" messages in your email account).    As for friends, try doing acivities that you enjoy doing, and ask if there are any Christians present.  For example, maybe you like playing softball.  Go to the community center and take a look at the leagues for teams than may be church teams.  Find out when they are playing and then go talk to them during a game.  You've found Christian people who are not boring (they like some of the same things as you...softball in this example).    I know a lot of people will tell you "go to church and you'll find some really nice people there who will be your friend" but I know...a lot of those people are boring.  That's why I'd suggest the opposite approach...find people who you don't see as boring...and hang out with any Christians you find who enjoy the same.|`|AA10474496	I'm Christian.|`|1199f7a73393e205c7833937d370396baa	take a bus and go ahead leaving the past behind.

"Oh no", said the angel, "you can't bring anything with you to heaven".  But the man was very persistent, and he finally bargained to bring one suitcase with him.  Hurrying about, the man decided to make the most out of that one suitcase, he would melt down every precious metal he had and pour it in, as much as could fit!    The suitcase was incredibly heavy, but the man made it to the pearly gates.  Seeing him, St. Peter said, "sorry, no luggage".  "Aha!" the man replied, "your angel said I could bring one, just one, suitcase with me!"      "Well all right", said St. Peter..."but I'll have to take a look at what's in it, you know!"  So he opened the suitcase and looked in at a very large, solid brick of gold. St. Peter lifted his head, looked straight at the man and said in a very puzzled voice, "you brought pavement???"|`|AA10745195	Four nuns were standing in line at the gates of heaven.

Peter then asked the second nun if she had ever sinned. "Well, once I held a man's penis," she replied. "Put your hand in this holy water and you may enter heaven," he said.     Just then the fourth nun pushed ahead of the third nun. Peter asked her, "Why did you push ahead in line?" She said, "Because I want to gargle before nun 3 sits in it!"|`|45ad59ca5bcb56e19395e697ee3bc528aa	This lady approaches a priest and tells him, "Father, I have a problem. I have these two talking female parrots, but they only know how to say one thing." "They only know how to say, 'Hi, we're prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?'"    "That's terrible!" the priest exclaimed, "but I have a solution to your problem. Bring your two talking female parrots over to my house and I will put them with my two male talking parrots who I taught to pray and read the bible. My parrots will teach your parrots to stop saying that terrible phrase and your female parrots will learn to praise and worship the Lord."    "Thank you!" the woman responded.    So the next day, the lady brings her female parrots to the priest's house. The priest's two male parrots are holding rosary beads and praying in their cage.    The lady puts her female parrots in with the male parrots and the female parrots say, "Hi, we are prostitutes. Do you want to have some fun?"    One male parrot looks over at the other male parrot and exclaims, "Put the beads away. Our prayers have been answered!"     and this one too:    One day a middle-aged Jewish man named Leo hears from his son attending university. "I've decided to become a Christian, Dad."     Leo panics. "What do I do?" he asks himself. The only thing he can think to do is call his rabbi.     "Funny you should come to me with this problem, Leo," says the rabbi. "Not 2 years ago my son comes to me with the same speech. I had no idea what to do. I panicked, and the only thing I could think to do was go to God."     "What message do you think you got from God?" asks Leo.     The rabbi laughed. "God said to me, funny you should come to me with this problem ...'"     and lastly,    Two church members were going door to door, and knocked on the door of a woman who was not happy to see them. She told them in no uncertain terms that she did not want to hear their message and slammed the door in their faces.     To her surprise, however, the door did not close and, in fact, bounced back open. She tried again, really put her back into it, and slammed the door again with the same result.     The door bounced back open.     Convinced these rude young people were sticking their foot in the door, she reared back to give it a slam that would teach them a lesson, when one of them said: "Ma'am, before you do that again you need to move your cat."|`|472f1e599dc62d9ec49ae919ae70ea3caa	You can't polish a turd!

The husband thought it over and decided to pay the $5000 to have her transported back to the US and have her buried there.  The undertaker, baffled, asked 'Why pay $5000 when you can pay $150 and have her buried in the Holy Land?'  The man replied '2000 yrs ago a man was killed here, buried and on the third day He rose.

A country preacher decided to skip services one Sunday and head to the hills to do some bear hunting. As he rounded the corner on a perilous twist in the trail, he and a bear collided, sending him and his rifle tumbling down the mountainside. Before he knew it, his rifle went one way and he went the other, landing on a rock and breaking both legs. That was the good news.    The bad news was the ferocious bear was charging at him from a distance, and he couldn't move. "Oh, Lord," the preacher prayed, "I'm so sorry for skipping services today to come out here and hunt. Please forgive me and grant me just one wish: Please make a Christian out of that bear that's coming at me. Please, Lord!"

I don't know what kind of work you do with people but I'm sure that at least some of them are worse off than you and have a better attitude about life. Maybe you should get counseling. I once felt like I was cursed, also. I just kept going and did the best I could. I learned to love myself and realize I was worth loving. I was actually happy for the first time in years. Eventually, I met someone wonderful to share my life with and so it goes. There is a plan in place for you, too. Just try to look for the good things that are in front of you. Help people along the way and good things will come to you. Just remember to leave the bad behind and take what good there was along with you. Learn from your past. We all make mistakes. The good thing is that we grow because of them. Try to be positive. I wish you well.|`|664e25921f757045ca3dfca6841c83e4aa	It is worth it. You just need to find someone that shares your passion.

If you are an adult, I suggest reading the LEFT BEHIND series by Jerry Jenkins and Tim Lahaye. If you are a teenager, read the Left Behind: The Kids series. They are fiction books based on facts of what will happen during the tribulation. I Loved the books. They are SO good and helped me learn more about what is going to happen after the rapture.|`|AA10989450	I believe in a rapture, but unlike the fictional Left Behind series, what I get is from the bible.  The bible says we'll be saved from the final wrath, not the tribulation.  The final wrath comes after the trib. That explains why so many will be getting their heads lopped off.  Of course, if you read Enoch, the first paragraph of the book of Enoch sounds like it won't be Christians disappearing at all, it will be non-believers who will disappear.  Read your bible, then tell me where exactly it says we'll be saved from the tribulation.  Don't just listen to writers, everyone interprets the bible differently, they got a lot of things wrong in the Left Behind series, like all believers getting the mark of God.  Read Revelation, only 144,000 will be getting that mark, all Jews, 12,000 from each of the 12 tribes.  Do your own research.  The whole pre-trib rapture is just wishful thinking that's gonna cause a lot of anguish when the trib starts and all these believers are thinking there was a rapture and they missed it, that they got left behind.  Sometimes simply believing others interpretations of the bible can cause a lot of anguish.    Consider the fact that the tribulation is a warning for people to believe, what would be the point of taking all the believers away before it started?  To save us from the trib?  Did He save the diciples from their horrible deaths?  No, He was with them, but they died horrible deaths.  A pre-trib rapture is not only illogical, its presumptious.  Why do we deserve to not have to suffer, when His own diciples suffered so much?  Also, that would mean He'd had to return twice, and the bible makes it perfectly clear, He returns only once.|`|b97b76ad2f3eeeec41dbcc27ecb8b606aa	I think so.  They aren't dead yet.

968bc7c8dfa5c8ee23e19a7e540db963aa	Legalism, in Christian theology, is a pejorative term referring to an improper fixation on law or codes of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of pride and the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the grace of God. Legalism may also be alleged, in Christian theology, in criticism of theories which are perceived to be excessively dependent upon legal concepts. It represents the opposite extreme from antinomianism, the claim that moral laws are not binding on Christian believers. Simply put, legalism is belief, stated or supposedly implied, that law, not faith, is the pre-eminent principle of redemption.    Throughout the history of Christianity, certain beliefs and practices have tended to draw charges of legalism. These include:        * Ascetic practices such as fasting and other forms of self-denial. Those who believe in these things often defend them as practices that improve concentration on spiritual things and cultivate detachment from the world, and as practices that Jesus apparently expected his followers to continue.      * Various ordinances and customs that address subjects not directly covered in Scripture, such as customs disapproving of dancing, playing cards or alcoholic beverages. Believers in these customs often defend them as addressing issues and controversies that have arisen since the Bible was written.      * Ritual, such as the use of customary prayers and an elaborate liturgy. Believers in these practices often defend them as traditions with deep roots, and as logical expansions of practices that do in fact have Biblical precedents.      * Similarly, the insistence on certain exclusive ritual practices, such as a Saturday Sabbath or adult baptism or Passover (Christian holiday), especially when practicing these rituals is held necessary for salvation.      * Sacraments, especially when the underlying theology views them as vehicles of God's grace. Believers in these practices often defend them with the claim that the church was founded by God as the vehicle for grace, and that to reject them is to flirt with the gnostic notion that matter is inherently evil and cannot be a vehicle for God's grace.      * Biblical literalism of the sort that underlies Christian fundamentalism.      * The degree to which various ordinances of the Old Testament, such as the Ten Commandments, continue to be binding on believers. See also Old Testament Christian view of the Law.  a|`|AA10025366	Sure, I can give you an example from Yahoo Answers.  There have been a couple of people posting in the last couple of days who have gone on and on and on and on and on and on about worshipping on "Sunday", how you should not, etc.  Getting bent out of shape over something like that is legalism.  Especially when, in the new testament, the believers met on the "first day of the week" which in those times, was Sunday.    Another thing.  Around Christmas time, you're going to see people freaking out about Christmas trees.  Pagan, pagan!  They will scream..another example of legalism.    You'd better not shop on Sunday!  Legalism.  You'd better never have a drink, ever!   Legalism.  How dare you ever listen to anything other than praise music!  Legalism.    These people are more interested in being accusers of the bretheran than they are in lifting others up and loving them.  They are usually Christians, unfortunately, and have a penchant for pointing out what "other" Christians are doing wrong.  Very annoying people.  Their counterparts in the bible are the Pharisees, who, for example, got upset at Jesus for healing a man with a crippled hand on the Sabbath.|`|424b57fcdb04cc68699931a10bb90107aa	Working your way into heaven.

Legalism is the process of becoming a fundamentalist. . .and while it can be a good thing to return to the basics. . .to take a fundamental approach to things. . .it is not such a good thing when the disease of fundamentalism takes root in one's thinking and acting. . .and, sadly, we have seen this take place in all three of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).|`|AA12281718	In laymans terms, legalism is when you you go 'by the book' in every single way, but without the heart of love. It is to do things for the sake of doing them and to follow rules and make rules for others to follow. Legalism always puts people in bondage. It always causes criticism and bitterness. Legalism ties people up to the point that they find they are dmaned if they do, and damned if they don't. Legalism makes rules that are impossible to obey. It sets standards that are impossible to hold, and keep.  It wraps people up in misery.  The pharisees of the old testament were legalistic. They made rules for others and forced them to suffer. They didn't really care about the poeple, only about the following of rules.  Red tape is all about legalism. It is about the following of rules to no purpose.

ba9652918ca2db46c0c908c1ccbb9ffbaa	Jehovah is called the happy God.  (1 Timothy 1:11)  He creates and works with joy for himself and his creatures. What he brings about makes him joyful.  (Psalms 104:31)  He wants his creatures likewise to enjoy his works and to enjoy their own work.  (Ecclesiastes 5:19)  Since he is the Source of all good things (James 1:17), all intelligent creatures, both mankind and angels, can find their chief enjoyment in coming to know him. (Jeremiah 9:23,?24)  King David said: Let my musing about him be pleasurable. I, for my part, shall rejoice in Jehovah. (Psalms 104:34)  He also sang: The righteous one will rejoice in Jehovah and will indeed take refuge in him; and all the upright in heart will boast.  (Psalms 64:10.)  The apostle Paul urged Christians to take joy at all times in their knowledge of Jehovah and his dealing with them, writing to them:  Always rejoice in the Lord [Jehovah, in several versions].  Once more I will say, Rejoice!Philippians 4:4.    True joy is a quality of the heart and can affect the whole body for good.  A joyful heart has a good effect on the countenance, and a heart that is joyful does good as a curer [or, does good to the body], says the wise writer of Proverbs.Proverbs 15:13; 17:22,    (Psalms 100:2)  The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold, said one of Gods faithful servants.  (Nehemiah 8:10.)     Then, too, the marvelous hope ahead surely gives strong ground for joyfulness.  (Rejoice in the hope; Romans 12:12)  Their salvation is a basis for joy.

The History of the Jewish Khazars. New York: Schocken Books, 1967.    2. "The Khazars." The Dark Ages: Jews in Christian Europe, 711-1096. 1966.     D Dunlop, tells us: .Do you know who the jews really are? (I call them Jews to you, because they are known as Jews. I don't call them Jews myself. I refer to them as so-called Jews, because I know what they are.) The eastern European Jews, who form 92 per cent of the world's population of those people who call themselves Jews, were originally Khazars. They were a warlike tribe who lived deep in the heart of Asia. And they were so warlike that even the Asiatics drove them out of Asia into eastern Europe. They set up a large Khazar kingdom of 800,000 square miles. At the time, Russia did not exist, nor did many other European countries. The Khazar kingdom was the biggest country in all Europe -- so big and so powerful that when the other monarchs wanted to go to war, the Khazars would lend them 40,000 soldiers. That's how big and powerful they were.      They were phallic worshippers, which is filthy and I do not want to go into the details of that now.     These are the people who became what we call Jews.. There wasn't one of them who had an ancestor who ever put a toe in the Holy Land   But that was their religion, as it was also the religion of many other pagans and barbarians elsewhere in the world. The Khazar king became so disgusted with the degeneracy of his kingdom that he decided to adopt a so-called monotheistic faith -- either Christianity, Islam, or what is known today as Judaism, which is really Talmudism. By spinning a top, and calling out eeny, meeny, miney, moe, he picked out so-called Judaism. And that became the state religion. He sent down to the Talmudic schools of Pumbedita and Sura and brought up thousands of rabbis, and opened up synagogues and schools, and his people became what we call Jews..      Not only in Old Testament history, but back to the beginning of time. Not one of them! And yet they come to the Christians and ask them to support their armed insurrections in Palestine by saying, You want to help repatriate God's Chosen People to their Promised Land, their ancestral home, don't you? It's your Christian duty. We gave you one of our boys as your Lord and Savior.      You now go to church on Sunday, and you kneel and you worship a Jew, and we're Jews. But they are pagan Khazars who were converted just the same as the Irish were converted. It is as ridiculous to call them people of the Holy Land, as it would be to call the 54 million Chinese Moslems Arabs. Mohammed only died in 620 A.D., and since then 54 million Chinese have accepted Islam as their religious belief. Now imagine, in China, 2,000 miles away from Arabia, from Mecca and Mohammed's birthplace. Imagine if the 54 million Chinese decided to call themselves Arabs. You would say they were lunatics. Anyone who believes that those 54 million Chinese are Arabs must be crazy. All they did was adopt as a religious faith a belief that had its origin in Mecca, in Arabia. The same as the Irish. When the Irish became Christians, nobody dumped them in the ocean and imported to the Holy Land a new crop of inhabitants.    They hadn't become a different people. They were the same people, but they had accepted Christianity as a religious faith.

The state of Israel is *not* being a blessing to all nations at present; it is in fact, terrorizing them, including many of our Middle Eastern Christian brothers and sisters. The Apostle Paul instructs Christians to tell the Jews about Jesus, to respect them as the people through whom the Old Testament and Jesus Christ were given to the world, and to remember that (Romans 11) some day all Israel will be saved. There are Old Testament prophesies in which God says that one day, "not by might, not by power, but by my Spirit" the Jewish people will live as the people of God again AT PEACE WITH ALL THE OTHER NATIONS OF THE EARTH.

add4ce6d4b7020750071b5f71a90e10daa	as a muslim, i can tell u that we do believe in the early bible and early torah.  We dont believe in the changes that have happened to both over the years and as a matter of fact, it is believed that if it weren't for these changes all three religions would b identical.  the modern day term tossed around for bible implies the new, translated and changed bible, therefore we don't agree with it.  as a matter of fact, the entire basis of the muslim religion was a response to all those changes and a return to what God actually meant for his people.  Here's the deal, on judgement day, all those who believed in one God (the God in all three religions) WILL end up in heaven,  the good christians, good jews and good muslims will go to heaven right away.  Whereas the bad will spend some time in hell and then go to heaven so long as they have a smudge of belief in god in their hearts.  Jews and Christians alike will not be sent to eternal hell ... they are the people of the book ... everyone will stand judgement, but the people of the book are the only ones who will make it to eternal heaven. they, the jews,  are not said in the koran to be the sons of pigs lol thats recent and political ... but those who steer away from God, I wouldnt be surprised to find insults about them in the Koran.    also the christian doctrine saying Mohammed was a false prophet came from earthly beings .. the church! (islam came about 500 years after jesus's death) so a true christian would say to you "who the hell were they to make that distinction?" it didnt come from a revelation, it didnt come from god, it came from a dude who studied religion and didnt like what he was seeing.    and for the person who said Allah is not God, I would like to buy him a ticket to the Middle East where he can meet with Arab Jews and the millions of Arab Christians who are going to be PISSED OFF at his theory since his claims make it so that they have been worshiping the wrong god all along.  Allah is the Arabic word for God, and everytime arabs (muslims, christians and jews alike) hear people making distinctions between the two, they take it upon themselves to have a chuckle at em (btw my mom is christian and has been holding talks about this very subject for the last 2 years or so)    hope this helped :D|`|AA10632741	Actaully I am muslim...I am going to tell u the truth so plz don't think that i am insulting or offensing anybody!!

Hope this has helped u ...|`|e9ee082b326d6609f7b91d448046af61aa	fine first i want u to read ur bible and understand it well. the problem is not with the bible itself. it is with the eople who abriged it and who read it and those who change it. well it was not God who changed or rejected bible, it was the man and church. it was not God who said that change urself from OT to NT, it was man. it was not God who said tist and turn the words and rules of the Bible, but it were humans.    ok, will u agree with me that there are people who change the biblic rules as per their wish, u know it dont u? so therefore, the WORD OF GOD  is not wrong but it was man who does not follow the Bible and religion. and thus concluding there is no fault with the bible but fault with people who modify it and who change the rules as per their desire.    and second, i would like u to give me a verse from the Quran which says jews are pigs and about the 1,44,000. i have read the Quran over and over again, but i never came across this. well Quran has said that some of the jews and christians have taken their rabbis and preists to be their God. now that is not wrong, what it said as their was idol worship in those days and people gave church more authority than Jesus-pbuh himself. so hope u will give me the verse.    if u give me the verse where it says false prophets will come, then it refers to those like those in todays world who take heroes from mythology and stories/epics.    and i want u to read the bible carefully and tell me where it says that Muhammed-pbuh would be a false prophet. in any case im giving u this, to show that muhammed -pbuh was mentioned in the bible..    Just a quick note, the Arabic word "Muhammad" is an expression which means "The honorable one" or "The glorified one" or "The admirable".  Prophet Muhammad was the first in the Middle East to be named "Muhammad".  Below, you will see how Jesus in today's Gospel of John had called this human Prophet which he predicted his comming "The honorable one".    Jesus in the Greek Bible used the Greek word "Periklytos" which means the admirable or glorified one. He called that predicted human prophet "Periklytos".  This word corresponds exactly to the Arabic word "Muhammad" which also means the "admired one" or "glorified one." In other words, "Periklytos" is "Muhammad" in Greek.    Let us start...    In the Bible we can find the following four passages wherein Jesus (peace be upon him) predicts a great event:     John 14:16 "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever"     John 15:26 "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me"     John 14:26 "But the Comforter, [which is] the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."     John 16:7-14 "Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: Of sin, because they believe not on me; Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you."     In these four verses, the word "comforter" is translated from the word "Paraclete" ("Ho Parakletos" in Greek). Parakletos in Greek is interpreted as "an advocate", one who pleads the cause of another, one who councils or advises another from deep concern for the other's welfare (Beacon Bible commentary volume VII, p.168). In these verses we are told that once Jesus (peace be upon him) departs, a Paraclete will come. He will glorify Jesus (peace be upon him), and he will guide mankind into all truth. This "Paraclete" is identified in John 14:26 as the Holy Ghost.     It must be pointed out that the original Greek manuscripts speak of a "Holy pneuma." The word pneuma {pnyoo'-mah} is the Greek root word for "spirit." There is no separate word for "Ghost" in the Greek manuscripts, of which there are claimed to be over 24,000 today. The translators of the King James Version of the Bible translate this word as "Ghost" to convey their own personal understanding of the text. However, a more accurate translation is "Holy Spirit." More faithful and recent translations of the Bible, such as the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV), do indeed now translate it as "Holy Spirit." This is significant, and will be expounded upon shortly.     All Bibles in existence today are compiled from "ancient manuscripts," the most ancient of which being those of the fourth century C.E. Any scholar of the Bible will tell us that no two ancient manuscripts are exactly identical. All Bibles in our possession today are the result of extensive cutting and pasting from these various manuscripts with no single one being the definitive reference.     What the translators of the Bible have done when presented with such discrepancies is to do their best to choose the correct version. In other words, since they can not know which "ancient manuscript" is the correct one, they must do a little detective work on the text in order to decide which "version" of a given verse to accept. John 14:26 is just such an example of such selection techniques.     John 14:26 is the only verse of the Bible which associates the Parakleto|`|bf298556d13429a58d34ccce33e0a96faa	Why can't you see the larger picture?

This is because it is beyond man's ability to correct the work of his Creator, who alone is Almighty and perfect    The Bible is a collection of writings by many different authors. The Qur'an is a dictation. The speaker in the Qur'an - in the first person - is God talking directly to man. In the Bible you have many men writing about God and you have in some places the word of God speaking to men and still in other places you have some men simply writing about history      The oneness and universality of God's message requires that people accept all the messengers of God. Rejecting one of them amounts to rejecting them all. The Jews reject Jesus's mission and Muhammad's mission; the Christians reject Muhammad's mission; whereas the Muslims accept them all, but reject incorrect historical interpretations and human elements in these missions.    The Final Prophet Muhammad said: "Whoever believes there is no god but God, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is messenger of God, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven."|`|AA12095932	Which book is "THE" Bible?|`|d3ff4e9b017372a92d5b1dffa4e7b4f6aa	hello u cant convince a muslim-only Jesus their prophet can-the koran says he is the only one without sin and born from a virgin-mohmed married a girl between 6 and 8 years old -u do the math-but ive helped many x muslims to Jesus and true faith and joy knowing God-pray for me too|`|b9f6e83087281c78e4e84187d3f69e81aa	Simple.

It is an Islamic belief that Christ was a major prophet, like Moses or Elijah, and also Muhammed. They believe that worshiping him as the Son of God is idol worshiping and would be like a Christian worshiping Moses rather than God. It is not necessarily "Christian Doctrine" that Muhammed was a false prophet, however the general concensus is that he was no greater than Elijah or Moses, if even that great. I personally think of him in a similar manner as one might think of Ghandi.|`|ff7565215da7d164aaa83183d8a7032baa	I will answer one by one. It is wrong to say that the Muslims  accept the Bible as it is today. Even it is difficult to define "BIBLE".  Which Bible? Which version?The Jews also use The Old Testament portion but reject the rest--which is around 1/20 of the complete KJV.  When they say that they accept the Bible--they say it a bit loosely.  The Muslims accept the original scriptures revealed to not only  the Jewish Prophets and Jesus--but even to the ancient Hindus(because God sent messengers to all races--not only the Israelites). The concept is --the original scriptures is perturbed and corrupted and they are not reliable. I don't know were you got the 99% conflict--can you produce your proof? That Muhammed is a false prophet is not mentioned in the Bible--in any literal form.You cannot just interpret certain verses as it suits you to prove that point.  Again, the Jews from whom you inherited the largest part of your so-called Bible completely rejects the New Testament. The number  144,000 is mentioned in NT--which is the most metaphorical and  thousand variant interpretations are made of it(causing a great deal of confusion). I know that in Quran it is mentioned that certain Jews were transformed into pigs and apes for violating the Sabbath. It didn't generalize the Jews and Christians.Please, next time quote your verse.  Another thing that the Bible is not a coherent single book--it's a collection(who decided which should be included in the Canon and   which shouldn't be ?and it's debatable if they were biased or not)of  66 books. Even that number varies.|`|510521ece8f37366ab484da13cf5cfd2aa	muslims accept both the torah and the bible,but only the original versions of them....

Basically the Hindus believe in One God(Brahma). The images and statues you see in Hinduism are merely symbolic. The Nataraja(The Lord of Dance) was called "the greatest living metaphor of how the universe works" by Albert Einstein. Deepavali is one festival which is celebrated by all Hindus. It/'s da day Lord Krishna(their Christ) defeated the demon and brought light into the lives of people. That's why Deepavali is called "the celebration of da triumph of good over evil". The Bhagavad Gita is their bible. The bhagavad gita has inspired famous people like William Blake,Emerson and Thoreau.  Basically it's a dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the eve of a great battle...it explores the themes of courage,love,honour,death,virtue and fulfillment. Agd the Hindus believe in reincarnation too. Every living thing on this planet has a soul..therefore it should be treated with kindness. That's why animals,esp cows are considered sacred but not worshipped(contrary to popular belief). And if i'm not wrong,Hinduism believes in evolution. Both physical and spiritual evolution. I hope i've answered your question.|`|AA12346961	For the shallow: Idols, rituals, festivals.    For the deep: Universal brotherhood, love -- the same as any other religion on this planet.    Hindus have a lot of festivals; a lot more than the other religions.    About the faith, some believe in the rituals; others in deeper stuff. But there are more people in the first category just the way you find in all the other religions.

He did something desperate and unthinking in his late teens.  Unfortunately, he was already 18 and legal age.  He was convicted as a felon.  He was always a hardworking, loyal person.  After 8 months in jail(he was out almost everyday, to go to work)He has taken every advantage, to turn things around.  He has his own home and a good job.  He still has to be very careful who he associates with and not to be around fire arms.  He still has about a year left on a five year probation period.  There are jobs he will never be able to get, because he is a felon.  The felony will follow him the rest of his life.|`|AA11610838	Yes I do know someone who has done exactly what you stated -- turned their life around after a felony charge against them resulted in jail time.  It was very difficult...no joke about that...but it was possible and he eventually made it.    The hardest part for him was trying to overcome the social stigma of carrying the "felon" tag.   Simple things we take for granted, like our right to vote, had to be fought for and won...this alone was a several year process AFTER he had done his time in jail and was released.  He did not try to get schooling as he was already a skilled tradesman, but returning to the workforce was also a challenge.  Nobody wants to take a chance on a "felon" ... so another uphill battle of facing rejection after rejection before finally finding a good job.   I was in touch with him throughout all of this and many times he thought he couldn't keep on fighting.  Basically, it was a very demeaning, embarrassing, uphill battle that at times seemed to have no end.  Once he got more time under his belt at his new job, the sideways glances started to ease up and after 6-8 years I think he would agree that NOW his ilfe is finally back to normal.     He knows he brought all this on himself, and is able to see this as just a really great life lesson....when we choose to live above or outside the boundaries we as a society have set, their will be consequences and in hindsight he has said many times that if he somehow could have known how HORRIBLE the aftermath would be, he would never have gotten himself in a position like that.   Not sure if this is what you're looking for..but hopefully it helps :)

God is prime element, which is converted into creation. In other word in the sky of infinity this infinitely existing, is called god, who is associated with all visible and invisible. God is an existence.  We are part of it, like a molecule in a stone. The molecule of infinity as a whole is called a stone. Likewise a small existence of god in every molecule is a prime truth. Effect of creation is called nature and being self  processed. The procedure of processing is nature, which is created by effect of creation.   Now god is an existence and every part of god is managed by automatic system of nature .We are being managed by nature, which is called, shakti(almighty) and whole existence is called shiva. Respectively territorial parts of nature are called bhagwan\ deities. The prime soul of whole existing is Ishwar, which at present is in salvation position. Ishwar was and will be almighty at the time of starting conversion of element into creation and end of creation (kayamat). Then after he will be new creator of new creation .It is endless process and continuous process. Molecules of creation are being transformed into Atma(soul) by its nature.  At present nature is almighty .All molecules of creation are self managed and effected (controlled) by automatic system of nature. Nature is effect of co-existence of molecules (creation). Now we are under control of territorial bhagwans\ deities (Territorial nature). keeping in view to above facts it is clear that at present god is an existence and being self processed by its nature.  Heaven\Hell is within the world and its atmosphere. This world is like a big computer and our soul is a curser.  Nature is not yet become perfect. She is partially negative also. She has desires for improvement, increase of her strength and capacity. She likes every thing as you compel to do by your nature. Now you have two ways, either you have to faith in your god or go with nature. Nature Involves enjoyment as well as punishment and sacrifice . Her every action gets reaction. So enjoy the life or strict in your faith in god. Who will certainly give you better position in next creation and you will be enjoy to infinite extent. If you are very bad man you will be toilet cleaner in next creation. So know your self and be cooperative and merciful to each other. Then, nature will also love you as well as god loves you.   Nothing is proved as that dangerous as the thought of taking yourself to be always right. The ill effect of orthodox principle was such that the world got filled with miseries, unlawfulness, war, crime and hatred. Blind faith on own religion, intolerance and imposition of own religion on others have done a lot of harm to this world. True religions never shout at each others sitting on the branches of same tree, whether it is wise to remain calm reaching to the root. Religion is not a chaos , but a peace. Religion doesnt spark the war, but is a friendship and love. .....  Nature cares all the creatures microbes , insect , evil as well as human. She has to arrange food for every one . there is dangerous situation for all. Who are saved ....there is end of every thing...  There is no sinner & winner, when we already surrendered our self according to the Gods will. we all are helpless even we can't sleep or breath own ways. we  are going to escape from evil's will and trying to become God believer and perfect one. At present, almighty (Ishwar) is in salvation position & nature is almighty. Any believer can't talk to him directly. You have to pray the nature. Without her cooperation your message will go to recycle bin.....You have to know reality.......................

My family arrived at Jamestown in 1609 and I'm sure the locals wanted them to go back where they came from.     Nativism is nonsense.

So strictly speaking, you're a native of whatever country you're born in.    But it's often used to mean 'indigenous' - ie that your ancestors were the original inhabitants and everyone else arrived later.  Only problem with this is that it's difficult to be certain that anybody was 'originally' anwhere.  Many historians believe that the 'Native Americans' came from Asia, crossing over the Behring Straits in prehistoric times.    So personally I reckon the 'born here' meaning is the most viable one.  In which case you're as 'native' as anybody.|`|0b13c821dcab072f1de94aa832fdd6bfaa	My family has lived here in Ireland for over 4 thousand years.

AA10025366	Yes, it is.  I am a born again Christian woman who left her husband six years ago.  I do not regret getting a divorce.  I do regret having sinned against the one I love:  God.  The bible gives adultery or desertion as the only "allowable" reasons for divorce.  My reasons were neither of those.    God has forgiven me and restored me; I have a beautiful life of peace, I lack for nothing.  The bible says a woman shall not leave her husband, but if she does, she is either to remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband.  We tried reconciling several times; I always felt the same:  get me out of here.    God cares about us and does not want us to be miserable the rest of our lives.  That being said, His word is His word, and I respect and honor it.  That is why I shall remain single the rest of my life.  I do not date.    By the way, I am an older woman and like being single...I am more than content.  I also have no children...I think that is a huge consideration for a Christian woman in contemplating divorce.    There are two things we must know:  that God's word is His word, and if we love Him, we must honor it.  Is it fair to appropriate His promises, but not His admonitions?  That being said, He is merciful, understanding. compassionate and forgiving.|`|AA10691438	Divorce isnt a sin if the grounds are adultery.... however... seems people pass right over where Jesus said remarriage unless the spouse dies is adultery.|`|85cf8d550d42e235899987f1d5d2be5eaa	divorce is a sin it says so straight out in the bible.

In realt, presumendo che - salvo casi eccezionali - almeno uno dei due lavori e quindi stia fuori di casa gran parte della giornata, sia da conviventi che da sposati si sta insieme, in realt, solamente poche ore al giorno, e la maggior parte di queste ore viene impiegata per mangiare, dormire e per altre piacevoli attivit.  Il vero collaudo avviene con la pensione, ed avete visto quante coppie, magari dopo una vita in serena, tranquilla unit, in queste circostanze avviano feroci contrasti e furibonde liti, che spesso portano alla loro separazione?  E' anche vero, per, che spesso la vera convivenza h 24 che si realizza con la pensione porta alla vera pienezza del rapporto, se si applica reciproca comprensione e tolleranza, comunque necessarie anche in et giovanile, forse ancora di pi dei giuramenti di amore eterno.

It's myth and a dangerous lie promoted by modern-day, misguided religions.|`|AA12213793	Matthew 22:29-33    primarily, verse 32....|`|AA11470673	it might be matthew or luke when jesus was talkin  to the disciples he asked ' who do you say i am?'  peter said' you are the son of god'  since somewhere else jesus mentioned my father  and i are one i guess someone put 1 and 1 together|`|AA10442850	There is no verse that says that, scriptures support that Jesus is Gods son. In John 10:30-36 Jesus said "the Father and I are one" and the jews were going to try to stone Jesus because they thought Jesus was trying to make himself a god. But in verses 34-36 Jesus said to them "Is it not written in your Law, 'I said: "You are gods" '? If he called 'gods' those against whom the word of God came, and yet the Scripture cannot be nullified,do you say to me whom the Father sanctified and dispatched into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, I am God's Son?" There Jesus does not say he is God, but asks if he's being called a blasphemer because he said he is Gods Son. Jonh 5:19-24 also supports that Jesus is not God, but works in unison with God. In the last sentences of 19 Jesus said "For whatever things that One does, these things the Son does in like manner." Finally Phillipians 2:5,6 there it says "Keep this mental attitude in You that was also in Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God's form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God." So even though Jesus lived in heaven as a spirit like God he never considered himself equal to God. Hope this was helpful.|`|a14a8b0955f7e55aa1155071a79b5609aa	JOHN 14:9    Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou [then], Shew us the Father?

But, your concept of what Christians believe is a little warped and I can see the anger in your words so it isn't chapter and verse you are looking for.    You know where to find it if you want.  It was after reading scripture that he said it to the people in the synagogue. You can look it up and it probably didn't say "I am GOd" because as you know.  It was a little more than that , that he fullfills a prophesy, that God is in him and he in the father and that he was "sent" and he is the Son.    So the exact words may not be there as you would like to point out.    As far as being "warned", like it say in your 360...you are probably very angry and need a friend. And, you also know that rules that "Christians" make in the name of god often don't hold true...    You need to read the Bible instead of some churches' doctrine.  So being "warned" by you...I'm ready...you are probably a "lightweight" in this and we can discuss anything you want.    ron    email me|`|AA10474363	in john 8:58 jesus said i am {i am is who god called himself } colossians 1:15  john 1:1|`|fa4c9ae2dff93eeedb6c95e6b56166cdaa	OMG ATLANTIDA SPOKE IN TONGUES!

She led him to worship her god, Baal.    She attempted to wipe out the worship of the true God and actually killed most of his prophets. Elijah, though was warned by God and fled, thus escaping with his life.    1 Kings 21:17-26 is where it was prophesied that she would be eaten up by dogs. 2 Kings 9:35-37 is where it came true.    Jehu, who later became king of Israel, was the one who actually carried out the prophesy when he told her attendants to "let her drop."|`|AA11610394	dont think so|`|AA11119479	Yes.

AA11382947	I went through it last year.    I was a Protestant and married a Catholic Girl, no this not a "Boy converts for girl" situation, I was a Deacon in my Chruch and She was a devout Catholic, we agreed before marriage not to try to convert either.  We both stuck to that and remained seperate faiths for 21 years.    We both had a base of faith, belief in God and the Divinity of Jesus, our children were raised in a Christian home.   I quickly learned that much of what I had been told about the Catholic Faith was either wrong, or mis-represented.  I gradually attended Mass more, my Protestant roots were always holding to the "Personal relationship with God" alone, but the beauty and sincerity of the Catholic faith Drew me into more understanding.    Her family also had a wealth of people that were great examples of the Catholic faith and had always accepted me 100%.  Maybe I was just lucky!    Without ever being prodded by my wife, at the age of 41, I finally got up from Mass one Sunday a year ago and went to R.C.I.A class.  I thought it would be a good thing to go ahead and "get it over with".    I learned so much about the faith and it's roots, about all aspects of the Chruch through the years, the good and the bad.  I learned how it all worked and that there really was a reason for the traditions and the Pope.  I understood Confession and the Rosary as well as our relationship and love for Mary (we don't worship her).    I am still a normal man, I go to Church more often and have a better outlook on life and am much happier.    In short, it was just time to do it, but I got so much more out of it than I would have ever dreamed possible!  This year I am a Sponsor.    I would say, don't be as hard headed as I and wait 21 years to join!    P.S. you can always go to class for a month or two and if it is not for you, you can drop out.  It is not a high pressure thing.    Peace, and may God Bless your Search.    I will Pray with you!|`|AA11119479	My spouse did, having decided to convert after many years of being an unbeliever. I think that EWTN (the Catholic radio and television network) was actually an influence. I attended some of the classes, too, but didn't convert.

AA10859773	Although I believe psychic abilities exist, I feel obliged to warn you not to make any decisions based on them - when it comes to your patients.  Investigating a hunch is one thing, but make sure you follow science first.    That said, the key to developing your psychic skills is meditation.    I can also personally recommend you get hold of The Idiot's Guide to Being Psychic.  It won't transform you overnight, but it has so very much good info that can help you.|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	I'm trying to open myself up to this kind of awareness.  I see someone offered some book references in the answer list.  One that I'm finding interesting is "You Are Psychic" by Pete Sanders, Jr.  The author is a graduate of MIT and incorporates the biology and metaphysical together in a more acceptable way than some other authors.  He also describes the 4 basic kinds of psychic sensing with a description/mini-exercises on how to tune into those senses.  There's also what seems to me a better approach to the issue of aura sensing which would come in handy in your field of work.      As far as suggestions....   The only thing I'm getting more certain of is you cannot force it to happen.  It takes a very passive state.  It's not "trying" to make it happen as much as learning to listen to what you're already getting at a subconscious/background level of awareness.  Consider how we gain information through the senses of sight, hearing, or touch.  It's not as much about "trying" to do those activities as much as properly directing our attention to those senses and opening ourselves up to what information is available.      Good luck.|`|81ce8fc06e11149869860f71cb7ee933aa	I will recommend these books to start you out.---|`|ae0c47e3c397805597c733341d41a55aaa	smoke loads and loads of patchouli.    you may suffer levitation dreams though with usage.       patchouli herb is well known for it's ability to awaken one's clairvoyance abilities.|`|AA10715286	Please just do it in the name of Jesus.

P.S; my grandma is actually a medium herself which she secretly taught me the basic skills of black-magic and spiritualism, though psychic and medium may come in a different approach in their teaching but both is neccesary need of a strong spiritual aura within themselves to do it, or thats possibility what my grandma see's in me, but anyway best of luck in enhancing your gift then and by the way don't try to bother what other think about you even so you can read their thought.|`|968b3612967b6bd2794e5cad0289e85baa	pray to the devil|`|AA10133207	Then you get really  close to the Lord, be quiet, and you will get guidance.

This ray is very harmfull and the food absorbs these rays.  When the food absorbs these rays it effects your digestive system in a reverse way. And effects your health.      And when this food enters your system it not only has a negative effect on you, you might even fall ill.  Just to avoid this situation you should not eat.

It is believed that in this month that the Qu'ran was revealed to the prophet Mohammad.     During Ramadan, Muslims all over the world restrain themselves from:     food  drink  sexual contact and intercourse  smoke     The fast is done during daylight hours for 30 days.     What most people don't know is that Ramadan is more than refraining from food and drink, but the follower must not partake in gossip, unlawful activities or thoughts. Worshippers must not look at unlawful things. Of course, those who are ill or small children do not fast.     Ramadan is basically the spiritual cleansing of the soul through self restraint.
4952d4a4e55b07ac45ef53b45cde7804aa	Weddings are considered grand family occasions. In the rural parishes the entire community helps with the wedding preparations. The older women giving last minute instructions to the young bride is a very common way of life.    In rural communities a large booth made of coconut leaves and bamboo is built and decorated with flowers. The table is decorated with a white table cloth with the cake being in the centre of the table. Next to the bride the wedding cake is the centre of interest. In the olden days people would not bring gifts but bid to uncover the cake with money. The cake was normally covered by a net. This money would be given to the couple as a financial start.    The wedding reception would be a time of feasting on curried goat, roast pork, goat head soup (manish water), rice, boiled green bananas, wine, rum punch, fruit punch and aerated water. It was customary at times to see the dinner table decorated with a roasted pig head and a large hard dough bread made in the shape of a duck or a chicken. The loaves of bread were placed on each corner of the table. The evening normally ends with dancing to the music of the local band in the district. The traditional entertainment at a wedding is a sound system with a local disk jockey.|`|157b173f58bb84abd1e98e2a8bfc1ac1aa	Not much different from a Christian wedding in the US.

There are many Scriptures in the Bible where the male parent is called "father" such as at Matthew 4:21--"Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets."|`|AA10715286	I don't!

AA12225848	The Sacred Heart of Jesus is today one of the most recognizable symbols of the Catholic faith. The image originated in France near the end of the seventeenth century when a nun named Marguerite Marie Alacoque (Often anglicized to Mary-Margaret) began to publicize her mystical visions of Jesus, who admonished her to devote herself and the country to the veneration of his heart, which she described the heart as the center of communication between humans and the Divine. St. Mary-Margaret's vision, of a heart entwined with thorns and flames, sprouting a cross from the top, was drawn from the visions of earlier mystics, and possibly from alchemical imagery common at the time.    A few decades after the Saint's death, the the bishop of Marseille, Monseigneur de Belsunce, consecrated his diocese to the Sacred Heart in an effort to spare the region from plague. The plague passed over Marseille, and the symbol became very popular, associated with acts of charity and piety and used as a charm against plague. Today, to devote oneself to veneration of the Sacred Heart is to in effect make the heart of Christ one's own- to create within oneself the love and compassion of Christ- in essence, to be Christ-like.|`|a583f4940f4f4b4eaa57daeb24bd7c01aa	The Sacred Heart is one of the names we apply to Jesus Christ.

f32a960319cb87da11f3c41c9d9846dbaa	Salam Alaikum,  I'm Muslim and I actually go to a Catholic school, so I wonder if I should now and then.   I would be hesitant in telling him striaght out that his teachers are wrong, he might go against them in different matters, not just religion. I do think however, that at 5 years old, he will be more likely to follow your example than that of his teachers. Keep him informed on the subject, and let him know what is right and what is wrong, but I wouldn't involve any faces or names. He might group all of them together as wrong.  I would take the  "people of the book" route; that they have the basic idea, but its been corrupted. Id present Islamd as an addition to what he is learning at school, and a perfection of it. That way he won't see teachers and students at his school as wrong and different than him, but be able to respect them.  Hope I helped.|`|54743227661b86c57929f330d80b2f10aa	this age is a critical one.  try ur best to teach him Islam, when he is on a solid base discuss other religions with him.

I do find your decision to place your child in a christian school to be rather odd considering his age.  Children learn their moral and religious values and traditions from the home from birth to about puberty.  If you are a muslim from birth and don't observe your chosen religion on at least a weekly basis, then don't expect your young impressionible child to "choose" Islam over Christianity.  He will be with children from Christian families and Christian teachers several hours a day, five days a week.  Christianity is a full-time lifestyle for many dedicated workers.  These workers send their children to the same Christian schools.    Most children see the dedication and sincerity and are won by that alone.      I recommend that if you want to raise your child by Islamic teachings, homeschool your child until they hit fifth or sixth grade.  This way they observe how you wish for them to handle the question of religion.  The best way to introduce your child to Christianity is to buy a Bible and read it with him.  When he asks a question that you can't answer, call a local Christian minister and answers are usually provided at no charge.  Baptists and independent ministers know the Bible better than the more liberal denominations because they hold the Bible in high respect.  It is the cornerstone of their faith.  Your child will then consider you an authority on religious matters and you will maximize your influence.|`|AA11934518	I fully support you in your feelings. Please do not get unduly bothered if you love your child and take proper care your son will understand your religion perhaps better than most of muslims around you.|`|AA10680367	u want ur son to b convent educated and at the same time retain islam ,how hyypocritical?y don't u send him to madrassa for good,at least then u'll have mental peace that he is learning islam .I think u r too confused yourself ,but i tell u when ur son grows up he'll definately see the truth i.e whether islam is the way of life or christianity?http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles.htm  http://bibleprobe.com/muhammed.htm|`|e9ee082b326d6609f7b91d448046af61aa	well a good beginning would be teaching him all the 5 Kalimas followed by Imaan-Al-Mufassal. and start teaching him the arabic alphabets. take him along with u for prayers. then u can start with very small surahs like -- Al-Ikhlas, An-Nas, Al-Kafirun, Al-Falaq and Al-Kauther. that would be a good start.     slowly he will gain. but let me also tell u -- if he wants to be a part of a different faith, then make him understand but do not pressurize or pester him. it is his choice and Allah will guide him.     may the peace and blessings of Allah(God) be with us and may He guide us in the right path. may He shower His mercy on us and protect us.|`|b54f3498c5b49790abdf2ee8cc8e9d1daa	you need to find an Muslim private school for him, or this will be confusing to him...My daughter is american and went to muslim school..(Al Nour)...which she did enjoy it and the difference cultures she learned.|`|AA10953750	he is only 5?, a child can get influence easy by his environment.  i say send him to a normal school.  and let him start praying at age 10 as recommended by prophet Muhamad (P).|`|0ad6604cae71cd6c5b6dffb5ed9da4b1aa	My question is..why does he go to private christian school if you want him to be Muslim??   i guess you have to do what is best in your heart for your child..no one else can really tell you what to do..|`|AA11661285	Tell him the basic!

My best friend is Jewish and her son grew up in an area that was predominantly white Christians, there were no other Jews around and it was harder for her to give him any sense of Jewish identity as there was no temple nearby.  My son's best friend is Muslim and I think his parents are a little worried about his identity and faith too.  If I were you, I would instill your own faith in him strongly outside of school and take him to services, so that he gets a strong identity at home.   From your question I can tell you are a person who wants their son to have a well rounded education and knowledge and tolerance of other faiths.  I think he will be fine there but only if you build it strongly at home and send him for Muslim religous instruction either afterschool or on the weekend.   If you have any reservations I would speak privately to his teacher or the dean of the school about them and tell them you do not want him "indoctrinated" and as long as you state it respectfully, they should respect your wishes.  Some Christians can get very strong about "spreading the word"  I wish my own children were in a Catholic or Christian school, so I have to take them to class for that outside of school as I said and work Harder to instill their faith in them.   I feel it is my duty as their mother to teach them.|`|4c27e28063700a3960fa200986703581aa	We live in a believing world.

I went and trust me it's confusing as all heck. Try to take him to public school or better yet home school the child. This approach will not do him any good. When I went as a child it didn't make sense to me to learn both religions and it will corrupt his way of thinking. Try taking him to islamic school or anything other than this. he will get overwhelmed. Respect is one thing but to learn it is another. there is a hadith where Sayyidina Umar RA decided to learn judiasm because he wanted to understand the jewish faith. the Pr. Muhammad ASW told him not to learn judiasm until he has learned islam to the fullest. which is going to take a LONG time. Now imagine a man of Sayyidina Umar's RA standards and then ours.

But I know very little about Islam, I think you are doing good, because the other option would be public school and they would be cruel and mean to him.  The Christian people won't.  My son has attended Christian School since he was 7 years old, he is a sophomore in High School now, I would not put him in public school because of the drugs, gangs, cuss words, disrespect and lack of values and morals.  Plus my son learns about God, whom I worship.  But there will come a time, when they make up their own mind, I pray he remains a Christian and not a non-believer (heathen or agnostic)    PS Christian schools and Catholic schools are not the same.  The Catholics separate themselves from the Cristian's schools.  They do not participate in sports or activities with Christian Schools, they are on their own.  The protestant churches don't agree with the Catholics idolatry doctrine.

In fact, they wrote about him specifically, saying that he would go among the sinners, heal the sick, cast out devils, etc.  Now God is a loving person, and I'm pretty sure he didn't just tell the Jew's what was going to happen, thus the story of Krishna (however you spell it) is really the story of Christ, told to another people by God, before it happened.  Thanks for the testimony builder! :)

Halloween , secondo il calendario anglosassone, la notte tra il 31 di ottobre e il 1 di novembre in cui gli spiriti e le streghe incontrano i Santi.     Il termine inglese "HALLOWEEN" ha origine nel Medioevo, nelle Terre del Nordeuropa, allora dominio dei Celti, con il termine "All Hallows" cio "tutti i santi".     Diventa poi "All Hallows Eve", cio la vigilia di Ognissanti, ed infine "Halloween".     Cos, dalle sue origini pi antiche, si arriva alla tradizione e al folklore attuale che si sta diffondendo in molti Paesi del mondo - Italia compresa - e che vede protagonisti soprattutto i bambini che, nella tradizione americana, in questa notte vanno di casa in casa dicendo "trick or treat", cio "dolcetto o scherzetto", cio o mi dai qualcosa o ti faccio un maleficio, un sortilegio|`|3383a733293a841e4521f92a5fc82fc0aa	 strano che un paese come l'Italia con pi di 2000 anni di storia e tradizioni imiti un popolo che discende dai galeotti europei del XVII sec.|`|b3734ec65f9c0e5ab3dc8b4bd7ffaddaaa	per noi  una festa commerciale come tante altre, discoteche e locali la utilizzano per attirare gente, come se fosse una sagra di paese|`|7454885700e3258a1680eb776cb73790aa	tutte le scuse sono buone per festeggiare qualsiasi cosa, ora c' anche la festa dei nonni, consumismo puro, ma se uno non sa come spendere i soldi o come divertirsi altrimenti, perch no? affari suoi|`|61998098f7973a569c1c9c732e94a050aa	 una festa divertente anche per i piccoli|`|97dd16ffd12d8bfe189d9fe2973bfae5aa	solo business!!|`|0c5b653d245a5ce5dd2f180edea0135faa	La festa di Halloween  inventata dagli Americani ed  un po' stupida ma fatta in compagnia ed in allegria diventa un momento di incontro tra le persone e di felicit.

AA12153514	Males, irrespective of their orientation, have the capability of enjoying sex outside a relationship. Most females only enjoy sex within a relationship - I know that this doesn't apply to all females, but its generally the case. This means that heteorsexual males sexual desires are generally restricted by females - who are the gatekeepers to sex.    Homosexual males don't have this restriction to worry about, and are free to engage in sexual activity both within and outside a relationship. This is why homosexuals tend to have more sexual partners than heterosexuals - and probably a main factor in them being regarded as a high risk group for STDs.    Also, any relationship requires there to be a certain level of antihomiphily to survive (differences between partners). Heterosexuals have this difference built in as males and females are biologically and psychologically different. Homosexuals have to invent these differences by seeking those unlike themselves (e.g. different age, race etc). Homosexuals who hook up with people very similar to themselves have great sex for a few weeks and then it dies off taking the relationship with it - a phenomenon described by lesbians as "bed death".    Throughout my life, I've considered myself to be bisexual so I get to see and experience both worlds. I know for a fact that I'm more likely to find a LTR heterosexual relationship than a homosexual one. Recently, my homosexual side has been in a state of decline, so I may not even be bisexual?|`|AA12256281	i hear what your saying.

"Chuck Norris Facts were originally seen on IRC, and on websites like the Something Awful forums, in early 2005. Conan O'Brien's Chuck Norris jokes on Late Night with Conan O'Brien (which generally center on Walker: Texas Ranger) have been seen as an inspiration for the fad. Chuck Norris Facts followed "facts" based on actors Vin Diesel and Bob Saget, and spawned similar "facts" about fictional character Jack Bauer from the television series 24, Mr. T, and other personages. The exaggerated style of these facts is similar to a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch called Bill Brasky. These are similar to "Tall tales" such as those of Paul Bunyan."    Of course, Chuck Norris doesn't have to read Wikipedia pages... he just stares them down until he gets the information he needs.

You can't make the choice for your family to change, you can only pray that God shows them the way.      Are you sure that it is "God" that is asking you to do these things?  Or is it a preacher, a religious teacher or some of your co-churchgoers?      Being a good example to your family through your actions, words and life, rather than being a proseltyzing GIT and verbally assaulting them every time you see them, will be more likely to have them respect and be open to your religious beliefs.    Christianity that is force-fed is obnoxious and off-putting.  That is probably what you sense when you are reticent to "talk to them" about God.    Rather than getting caught in a self-guilt-trip over your inability to preach to your family, why not quietly thank God for the blessings that they are to you, ask him to show you anything that will help you to bring them closer to him, and accept that perhaps His Spiritual Gifts to you do not include proseltyzing.    God never gives you a challenge that you cannot overcome.  The Christian God is a God of Love and Forgiveness, not a rampaging deamon intent upon grovelling worship and obedience to impossible demands.    Perhaps rather than trying to "show them the way", you could approach the most "approachable" of your family members and invite them to go to church with you one day.  Just don't be upset if they say "no".  Remember, YOU are not able to change someone's heart - only the Holy Spirit can do that.  For you to think that you can is sinful hubris.|`|899a12cf5ecdd55576bcea2107c760f8aa	I have struggled with this too.    Remember that this life is short and everything passes away.  Don't take yourself so seriously.  What is the worst thing that could happen?  They could get mad at you, laugh, reject you... whatever, but think about the worst that could happen and you will realize it is not that bad, just temporary.  It too will pass.  I highly doubt any of that bad stuff will come to you from your family, but if it does, maybe they are not really good family anyway.  They should accept you for who you are.  If they reject you now, they are rejecting Christ.  Keep praying for them, have faith and they will come around in time.     Also, try not to 'force' your beliefs on them.  It comes across as arrogance.  Just maybe share how happy you are now and what it has done for you.   Also, if you live confidently your Christian life, it becomes a gospel in itself.  They will soon be asking YOU, how come you have had so much positive change.    Peace!|`|12d99e1ff8a38fe71cc5bdd41198fd16aa	one would be surprised what faith can do. keep working on the situation and the results might surprise you. everything happens for a reason. remember time patience and perseverance accomplish all things.|`|7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	God never asks you to do something you can't.

No, this wasn't an insult, it's meant to  let you know that sometimes we have to go with the flow of things. It's very kind of you to pray for your parents and others but not to the point where you get scared. God has everything in hand. Salvation is one thing for one person and another for someone else. God always forgives and you seem to think you're running up against a brick wall. You're not. Make your faith as that of a little child's and just beleive instead of fearing. Bless you.|`|AA10889612	You should stop using Christ as your crutch. You get courage and inner strength when you least expect it. Like stopping a child from crossing a busy road, or giving blood, or speaking up for injusticesand being there for others. Stop thining about yourself so much. You need to grip on life!    Sorry to sound so brutal but you have your head too far in the clouds.|`|68af6fb9fa5e7a97ba069fd77bce020caa	Good question...I think that if you care enough about your parent's salvation (that is, if you believe in a Heaven/hell after death) and love them so much that you just want them to go to Heaven rather than the alternative, I think that you can overcome your fear, and I think you will. Pray.|`|AA11938657	Revert to Islam, my son, and you will be saved and God will grant you the courage and the wisdom to spread the Word of God.|`|362b869e83a34d875310e15bc22b9ca0aa	1 John 4:18  There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.    Is it better for your family to be saved or to go to hell?  You're on a train.  Are the people taking a ride home or a ride on their way to hell.  If God has chosen you to speak on his message then you are special and he upholds you, do not be afraid, just believe.  Perfect love drives out all fear.  Jesus sent people out two by two.  Take someone with you if it will help you to share your faith with others.  Hold a dinner for you family and do a "truth" play or something.  Get creative. Show them the truth with your life as well.  If they see the change in you it will speak volumes & they will probably come to you with questions.  2 Timothy 1:7  For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.|`|61cc6d26c5c0d5dac83c97da1b7c9994aa	Courage is proportional to your faith.    Pray for faith and God will grant it to you.|`|AA11533607	Evangelism & witnessing do take a lot of courage esp. when you know your audience isn't going to be receptive.  See if you can participate in an evangelism class at your church.  If they don't offer one ask your pastor about starting one.  The better prepared you are to speak about your faith and what you believe the easier it will be for you to approach your family.  Good luck & God be with you.

I'm what they call bi and I'm not really accepted by the Heterosexual or Homosexual community, I'm a inbetween, a confused person about my sexuality as so I'm thought to be.

En eso consiste el sacrifio de un sacerdote, porque ellos si creen en Jesucristo y tratan de imitarlo, ya que en sus 33 a?os de vida, no se caso, ni tuvo novias, unicamente se dedico a predicar y lo mataron.

Muchos sacerdotes que conozco, no van solos a ningun lado con una criatura o mujer despues de todo lo que esta ocurriendo con muchos violadores. Es por desicion propia.  El pedofilo es un enfermo, no importa si es cura o no. La abstinencia sexual no te impulsa a la pedofilia. Muchos sacerdotes y ex-sacerdotes que conozco, han decidido por el celibato con gran fe y saben que no deben jugar con fuego si no quieren quemarse.  Lo del matrimonio yo creo que es necesario sacrificarlo para llevar adelante una comunidad y estar a su servicio las 24 hs.

El celibato es un signo de esta vida nueva al servicio de la cual es consagrado el ministro de la Iglesia; aceptado con un corazn alegre, anuncia de modo radiante el Reino de Dios" (p. 451,  1579).     ?Es el celibato un sacrificio que Dios requiere de sus siervos, o es otra tradicin de hombres? La Biblia declara:     "Honroso sea en todos el matrimonio". Hebreos 13:4     ?Incluye esa frase a los lderes religiosos, como los sacerdotes y monjas? Cuando la Palabra de Dios enumera las cualidades de los obispos, quienes son lderes religiosos, se nos dice:     "Pero es necesario que el obispo sea irreprensible, marido de una sola mujer...". Timoteo 3:2     Dios pone el mismo requisito para los diconos:     "Los diconos sean maridos de una sola mujer, y que gobiernen bien sus hijos y sus casas". 1 Timoteo 3:12     Desde el principio, el plan de Dios siempre ha sido que los hombres tengan esposa. Poco tiempo despus de crear a Adn, el primer hombre,     "... dijo Jehov Dios: No es bueno que el hombre est solo; le har ayuda idnea para l". Gnesis 2:18     Dios no slo expresa su aprobacin por el matrimonio, sino que da esta poderosa advertencia:     "Pero el Espritu dice claramente que en los postreros tiempos algunos apostatarn de la fe, escuchando a espritus enga?adores y a doctrinas de demonios; por la hipocresa de mentirosos que, teniendo cauterizada la conciencia, prohibirn casarse, y mandarn abstenerse de alimentos que Dios cre para que con accin de gracias participasen de ellos los creyentes y los que han conocido la verdad". 1 Timoteo 4:1-3     El celibato no es un requisito establecido por Dios, sino una doctrina de demonios. La Biblia anuncia que los que ense?an esta doctrina estn "escuchando a espritus enga?adores y a doctrinas de demonios; por la hipocresa de mentirosos...".     Por favor, comprenda, estas no son palabras mas, sino Palabra de Dios.     Cun trgico es que sacerdotes y monjas en todo el mundo se estn privando del placer de compartir sus vidas con un cnyuge, creyendo que su sacrificio agrada a Dios, cuando en realidad son presa de un poderoso plan satnico.     Si tan slo los sacerdotes y las monjas pudieran comprender que Dios no pone tal requisito... y que estn siendo enga?ados por Satans. Dios ha registrado todas estas verdades en su Palabra. Si tan slo ellos pudieran verlas y entenderlas.     ?Hubo un papa casado?    Pocos catlicos se dan cuenta de que Pedro, el "primer papa", fue un hombre casado:     "Y la suegra de Simn estaba acostada con fiebre". Marcos 1:30     Este Simn no es otro sino el apstol Pedro (vase Mateo 4:18 y 10:2).     ?Cul es el motivo de esta doctrina?    Esta doctrina catlica, como todas las dems que hemos examinado, se opone directamente a la Palabra de Dios. Nos preguntamos por qu el catolicismo ense?a que el celibato "anuncia de modo radiante el Reino de Dios", cuando el Se?or declar que esta doctrina se origin en el infierno.     ?Ser porque la Iglesia Catlica no quiere pagar los millones de dlares que costara cada a?o sostener a las familias de los sacerdotes y monjas?     Conclusin    Ahora que sabe lo que la Biblia ense?a acerca de este tema, usted debe decidir si creer la Palabra de Dios o las tradiciones de la Iglesia Catlica.     Si usted es un sacerdote o una monja, por favor, pregntese realmente a quin est agradando su sacrificio:     "Sea bendito tu manantial, y algrate con la mujer de tu juventud".

It is really difficult to be Muslim and at the same time a homosexual but you can not change who you are.  Even if you have sex with women all the time, it would not change anything.  I was in denial before and tried to change myself.  Instead of helping myself I became more frustrated and depressed.  You have to live with it and find ways to deal with your sexual desires.  Some Muslims would even migrate to other countries that are tolerant with homosexuals.  I suggest you try chatting online in Yahoo Messenger.  There are a number of gay Muslims who chat online.  You can try talking to them and probably find ways to live with your homosexuality.|`|06cc40e79400c401ab109750ee0fc563aa	Everyone can control himself if he wants to and don't listen to that crap "i'm born gay, once gay always gay" cause it's against human nature and u r the only one who can change yourself but u need to have a strong will...

Basically, something causes it to get out of whack for a few minutes (or hours)  It can happen if you're drinking or eating something or for no reason at all.  It happens to me sometimes if something interrupts my regular breathing pattern.  It's why some people think holding your breath helps to get rid of them as if your breathing pattern is misaligned and you need to get it back on track.

90f0decfa3315889bfb47196ef37c481aa	Donny io credo che dire che le capacit delle donne siano "...spesso di gran lunga superiori alle nostre..." non sia molto diverso dall'affermare con maschilismo l'esatto contrario. Io sono convinto che le donne non siano migliori n peggiori degli uomini, sono sicuramente diverse e bisogna accettarlo. Non credo aspirino a diventare come noi, vogliono solo lo spazio che per troppo tempo  stato loro negato, quello che permette loro di esprimere i loro pregi ed i loro difetti senza alcun condizionamento e senza discriminazioni sessuali, esattamente quello che abbiamo fatto noi uomini per secoli.  Ci sono donne fantastiche, intelligenti e capaci, ci sono uomini grandi che hanno fatto cosa incredibili. Ma ci sono degli esempi negativi per ambo i sessi: a questo punto cerchiamo di non cadere in un sessismo al contrario lodando inutilmente la superiorit delle donne che, diciamolo chiaramente, non l'hanno MAI chiesto. Lasciamo che possano dimostrare quello che sono perch, senza la nostra interferenza, sono capaci di farlo da sole.|`|6248896ac3de4c2ce8ec45fb3a9601d3aa	Eccomi,pronta ad uscire dal coro.Non credo che la donna sia pari all'uomo,perch in alcuni campi (salvo qualche eccezzione)  il solo uomo a farla da padroneper sua costituzione fisica e intellettiva.   giusto che i sessi abbiano pari opportunit,ma mi sembra che nella corsa sfrenata a dimostrare tale parit la donna sta perdendo di vista alcuni valori per me molto pi importanti della scalata al potere,e cio la famiglia.I figli crescono sempre pi soli o con altri,non pi con la mamma a fargli da guida,e il tenere unita la famiglia  un dovere sempre meno sentito.  Io non voglio essere superiore all'uomo e mi sento gi pari grado anche senza riconoscimenti.  Per finire mi sembra che le varie pupe,veline,letterine etc dimostrino che basta usare bene le gambe e il gioco  fatto:Ed  quello che stanno percependo le nostre figlie.

L'uomo sarebbe cos  c a z z o n e  da rinfacciare loro il fatto di averglielo concesso. Oggi la donna  autonoma, indipendente ed  soprattutto emergente. Basta ancora un po' e potr dire di essersi conquistata tutto da sola. Anzi, che provi a calpestarci: nella battaglia vincer la meritocrazia!!!!

Compliementi per la consapevolezza, non  da tutti una tale ammissione n una tale finezza di pensiero.  Complimenti anche ai tuoi genitori e a tua madre...sono convinta che una persona che ragiona come te ha un background familiare che ha dato esempi positivi!    Per Claudia: mi basta che mi trattino da inferiore gli altri...ci manca solo che faccia anche finta di esserlo. Per fortuna sono una donna con le palle e sono riuscita a raggiungere nel mio campo una professionalit che spesso supera quella di molti miei colleghi maschi...altrimenti mi avrebbero gi schiacciato come si fa con uno scarafaggio. Nel mio campo poi c' un maschilismo imperante,  difficile per un uomo accettare che una donna sappia assemblare un pc e capisca di cavi elettrici.   Preferisco dimostrare che siamo uguali a loro, piuttosto che far finta di non esserlo!    X Penelope1... sulla costituzione fisica ti posso anche dare ragione (salvo il fatto che conosco eccezioni di ragazzi che non hanno la forza neppure di spostare un materasso da soli)...ma su quella intellettiva mi piacerebbe avere dei chiarimenti, ovviamente non polemici ma esplicativi... quali sono secondo te le caratteristiche della "costituzione intellettiva" maschile che li rendono pi adatti delle donne a farla da padrone?    Aggiungo che la famiglia  composta da madre, figli e PADRE...e che resto sconvolta nel vedere come la maggior parte dei padri non sappia nulla dei prori figli, e trascorra le poche ore libere domenicali incollato alla tv.  Io ho avuto molto bisogno di entrambi i miei genitori, che per fortuna mi sono sempre stati vicini, ma quando mio padre non era disponibile per motivi di lavoro mia madre non poteva sopperire...perch avevo bisogno di mio padre, non di un surrogato. I genitori servono entrambi.  Quindi... basta parlare di madri snaturate perch lavorano!... Anche i padri servono ai figli, non sono solo fonte di sostentamento e di denaro come spesso fanno...hanno cose da insegnare che le madri non possono insegnare, proprio perch uomini e donne sono diversi tra loro e ognuno ha delle specificit differenti!|`|3bd94a03d30918b88db5eb43246a84c6aa	ho risposto anch'io a quella domanda, la tristezza  che quello  un ragazzo, perfino mio nonno era pi progressista!  Il problema  che gli uomini maschilisti vengono comunque partoriti da donne, che probabilmente li trattano per tutta la vita da principini.   Neppure tutte le donne hanno la consapevolezza che hai tu, forse hai alle spalle una madre che ha saputo darti le capacit di essere indipendente, molti altri non cercano in una donna la compagna di vita, ma un'altra mamma...  Non penso che le donne siano migliori degli uomini, forse le bastonate di secoli le hanno rese pi sicure su quel che vogliono, e soprattutto su ci che non vogliono pi...    X KAPDEVILLA: io invece non ne posso pi di domande inutili, che non insegnano nulla e non suscitano nessuna discussione costruttiva.|`|4f62fce4bafd4e3d293fd00d2520991daa	Ad ogni processo storico "estremo"  sempre seguito il processo diametralmente opposto; il fatto che all'epoca del maschilismo seguisse quella femminista era quasi inevitabile. Io credo che la tua sia un' ottima considerazione e che sia giusto rendersi conto di come sono cambiate le cose e magari anche dei motivi. D'altro canto credo anche che eccedere in un senso piuttosto che nell'altro sia ugualmente sbagliato. E' giusto che il vecchio modo di pensare maschilista venga smantellato e che la donna si prenda i suoi diritti, ma non  giusto che ci sia l' inversione di ruoli. Cio che l' uomo diventi una femminuccia e la donna il capo padrone. Ci deve essere un bilanciamento tra le parti e la donna non deve fare l' errore di tentare di superare l'uomo a sua volta, anche se non credo che lo far dato che  sempre stata oggettivamente + intelligente!!! ;-) Ciao|`|866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	Donny79, complimenti anche da me. Purtroppo esiste ancora il maschilismo, negli uomini perch pensando di non valere mostrano il contrario dominando le donne, un delirio di onnipotenza che li ha resi fino ad oggi gretti e insensibili.  Per le donne: molte donne maschiliste si rifugiano dietro le spalle del maschio perch hanno paura di affrontare il sociale. Criticano le donne perch si spogliano o fanno le veline, piene di rabbia perch loro non si sono consentite nulla e vorrebbero precluderlo alle altre.  Non giudico chi si mette in mostra o usa il suo corpo o cerca soldi, perch a me non toglie nulla, giudico chi prevarica gli altri. Donne smettetela di fare le moraliste perch  tutta invidia, non userei il mio corpo ma trovo legittimo chi vuole farlo, mentre i maschietti giudicano perch hanno paura delle corna.  Sul fatto che le donne abbiano una marcia in pi ci credo, ma non per costituzione. I maschi si sono preclusi, per dimostrare di essere forti, tutto il mondo dei sentimenti e questo d loro la marcia in meno. Altrimenti non si spiega perch i maschi gay siano tanto sensibili e intelligenti,  solo perch non hanno un ruolo e non devono dimostrare nulla.  I due sessi, innamoramento a parte, riconosciamolo, non si sono amati mai, tanto  vero che tu Donny sei un'eccezione. Gli uomini non amano le donne perch hanno paura dei sentimenti e le donne non amano gli uomini perch il proprio padrone non si pu amare. Siccome per ci sono urgenti bisogni di essere amati, uomini e donne si adattano e si cercano, ma questo non  amore. I due sessi potranno amarsi solo a parit riconosciuta da entrambi.|`|b3f85b4dba2826d687fedd178ccef428aa	stai gi iniziando a fartene una ragione. Sei sulla via della consapevolezza.

Shroom  1: Your treditional shroom. Skinny stem, brown cap, illigal in US. active ingrednts are psilocybin and psilocin, usally this is the most desirable shroom. Negative effects includes cramping vommiting for about 1 hour if at all. Pretty much a safe drug IF* what you get is an acutal shroom and not a similar looking Poisonos mushroom.    Shroom  2: Not so common shroom. Thick whitish stem, usally with a red cap with white spots, Legal in the united states. active ingreadents muscimol. Trip is diffrent usally not producing visual hellucenations. Negative effects are Cramps and vommiting however usally a lot more than shroom  1. However this mushroom looks allmost identicle to the "death cap" mushroom and is in the same familiy. Simply put if you eat a death cap your gonna die or come really close. Both of these shrooms are pretty safe (shroom 1 and shroom 2) but shroom  2 just gets mistaken for another type of mushroom more often than shroom  1 will be.    Chances are if ur getting ur **** from lets say a drug dealer its probly going to be shroom  1 because their more desiable and easier/cheaper to grow.    Shroom number 2 can be purchest on the internet usally called Amanita muscaria and are legal to posses, however the effects arnt as fun and chance of them getting mistaken is larger.|`|AA11687988	Since my comments "arents" really needed - I was just wondering where I might get some shrooms that give me the ability to spell "arents" - Any suggestions?|`|bf22bebea9c61dd723eaa74047da06b1aa	I **HAVE** to comment here; there was an article on mushroom poisoning in one of my recent nursing journals (RN, August 2006 issue).  You're talking about potential for needing a liver transplant, here!    .....if you want to use mood-changing substances, there are safer ones.    Things to consider about mushrooms, and you can decide for yourself---       Many experienced naturalists have trouble telling the difference between types, even with spore prints.       Amatoxin, found in many of the amanita family of mushrooms, has no specific antidote and is responsible for most of the mushroom-related fatalities in the US.  Mortality rate is 50-90%, with the higher numbers seen if liver failure and sepsis occur.    If you do choose to use mushrooms of any sort, PLEASE----if you have abdominal cramping, vomiting, and a lot of watery diarrhea 6 hours or longer after taking them, it is CRITICAL that you seek medical aid.  (This gut-related sickness will usually run about 24 hours, and there is a risk of dying from hypovolemic shock---low-volume shock---from fluid losses.)  If this happens, the med staff NEEDS to know you had mushrooms, because they'll be checking liver enzyme levels to see what's going on.    End of soapbox lecture.  But I do hope you'll change your mind, OK?--I've had patients die from liver failure, and it isn't very pleasant.

I know a couple people that have tried shrooms, and they both say it's like a more mild acid trip.  Picture being high, but seeing stuff in a totally different way....   The people I know usually don't remember much from their trip after their done.  As for if you'll know what you're doing or saying, I couldn't get a definitive answer from them. I would assume not, though.    If you're going to do it, and will not be persuaded out of it, then all I can say is "good luck."

AA11917001	The correct well known quote from Horace's Ode 3.30 as others have pointed out is:   Non omnis moriar multaque pars mei vitabit Libitinam.    It means:   I shall not wholly die and the greater part of me shall avoid the goddess of death (Libitinam)|`|edd81e809ec370deccef1c81a1d26333aa	non omnis Moriar means "Not all of me shall die" which are the opening words of Horace, Ode 3.30    I don't think there is a latin word oriar . . . perhaps a typo?|`|cb21116e20cde332d5517c1db7f4ce88aa	Non = Not  Omnis = All  Oriar = Rise    Not All (or, Everyone need...) rise!|`|AA10324123	Ash,    You may want to re-check your Latin phrase.      Chmaos is right about non omnis moriar, and Horace.    And, Krodgibam is right about non omnis, but is off by one letter on his translation to rise.  Rise in latin is orior, not oriar.  (Sorry Krodgibam, hope you're not offended).    Below is a link to an English/Latin translation site.  You will see that there is no Latin word 'oriar'.     However, if you check your original phrase you can use the website to easily translate the phrase for yourself.    http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/La...    Good luck.

I never grew up with hearing about the bible and I have never slept with a family member.|`|3fd9bc196b0f7bfea9ddfcd23c615250aa	We know not to marry or pair bond with members of our own family because of genetic dificiencies which arise from such unions. We've known this from before humans ever even wrote down their history.     We are biologically wired to spread our genetic material as widely as possible. If two siblings were to mate, the chance for harmful mutation would be high. It is bad for our continued survival as a species and we are genetically pre-disposed not to seek out members of our own family as mates.    But since you brought it up:    Genesis 20:12   And yet indeed, she [Sarah] is my [Abraham's] sister; she is the daughter of my father.     Genesis 17:16   And I will bless her [Sarah], and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.

Doesn't necessarily mean their respective religions invented the wisdom (though most say they did), nor does it mean that atheists can't recognize the wisdom.   Athesists may practice the wisdom written in religious texts, they just don't believe the source of the wisdom is a deity.     There is wisdom in not marrying a close relative because the offspring will have a higher probability of birth defects and their offspring will carry the weakened genes, too.      Although, that doesn't stop atheists or purported religious people from marrying their parents/children/siblings.

For example, there are scriptures which say that someone was going into a city when an event happened, where another scripture says he was leaving the city.  This apparent contradiction was cleared up when it was determined that there were two cities with the same name (like Sacramento and "Old" Sacramento), and the event occurred as he was leaving one and going to the other.  The accuracy of the Bible is astounding, and can be confirmed.|`|baa198aacdf80ead59f8f0fea0ada6f8aa	The Christian world has long been fired with the ambition to take the Gospel to every inhabited corner of the earth. This zeal has inspired a countless number of men to devote much of their entire lives serving as missionaries, ministers and teachers. Many theologians have devoted years to produce Bible helps for their fellow man. Witness the fantastic man-hours required to assemble the concordances, and the life-long studies to write complete commentaries on the scriptures. Then there are Bible handbooks, lexicons, Biblical encyclopedias plus hundreds and hundreds of Bible translations!       Perhaps we should give thanks more often to these men, though (mostly) not converted nor possessing Gods Holy Spirit as we understand it, yet who still gave their every effort to produce these helps for Christians today.      Certainly one of the most profitable works ever accomplished for us -- and especially for new babes in Christ -- is the harmony of the life of Christ. Jesus Christ should be the center and the focal point of every new converts life. The harmonies help the student grasp readily the life of our Savior in a way that a strong impact is made on his life. The harmony helps make Jesus very real!      The ink on the first autographs of the Apostolic writers was only 100 years old when Tatian wrote his Diatessaron in the Syraic language ca. 173-175 A.D. Tatian blended the four Gospels into one narrative with a certain amount of freedom as shown by Hobson.1      Since then, many scholars have constructed harmonies. Of the modern editions the one by Edward Robinson in 1845 has had the most influence on harmony development. Riddle revised Robinsons harmony in 1889. Clark, using the Authorized Version of the Bible, divided the life of Christ according to the Feasts. Waddy produced a harmony in 1887 using the Canterbury Revision.      Then in June, 1893, Broadus broke away from the traditional division by Feasts and showed the historical development of Jesuss life. He too used the Canterbury Revision. Stevens and Burton followed suit in December of 1893. These latter two harmonies were the major ones used by students of the English Gospels for some 35 years.        Kerr produced one in 1903 following the American Standard Version of the Scriptures, and harmonies in Greek continued to published as well. Then in 1919 Van Kirk published a partial harmony, The Source Book of the Life of Christ, which was the first to place Mark in the first column instead of Matthew.      The publishers of Ambassador Colleges Freshman Church History textbook, A. T. Robertsons Harmony, tell us on the front cover of the books jacket the brief history of this harmony:                  For more than a generation John A. Broadus great work has been the standard Harmony of the Gospels. It has gone through many editions. Professor Robertson, famous the world over as a New Testament scholar, has rewritten and rearranged Broadus book, using for his text the Revised Version, and bringing to bear on it all the light of the latest findings, in the field of New Testament research. College and Seminary Students, Sunday School Teachers and Pupils, Preachers and all Bible students will find this new Harmony unequaled for study purposes.      Besides Robertsons Harmony, I have in my possession for this study harmonies by Burton and Goodspeed, Greswell (four volumes of dissertations on selected harmony subjects), Mimpriss (an exhaustive work based on Greswells Harmonica Evangelica), Riddle, Stevens and Burton, and Strong.2 Mimpriss work is the most comprehensive harmony I have ever seen: 1,022 pages, 8" x 11" in size, with analytical introductions, scripture illustrations, notes selected from various commentators, practical reflections, geographical notices, copious addenda and indexes.      Since harmonists do not totally agree on how the Gospels should be divided and organized to produce an accurate harmony, we need to establish certain basic premises on which to build such an accurate four-fold portrait of Christ. This harmony will then attempt to solve certain problems in Robertsons Harmony based on these established premises.        FIRST PREMISE      There are two ways of life--that of giving and that of getting. Gods Word shows that the former leads to real happiness, peace and contentment, but sadly this world has chosen the latter. As a result we have chaos and confusion today! Man has never been so mixed up, goalless, unhappy! Whats the reason?      Most Christians still accept the Bible as Gods Word. But more and more theologians question the infallibility of the scriptures, even question the divinity of Christ! To many, the Bible has become a mere collection of uninspired (supernaturally) writings, ramblings of bewhiskered, old white-haired prophets, the acts of Apostles who had followed a Nazarene do-gooder who traveled around Galilee and Judea performing wonderful healings (or so His followers claimed), and Who was finally killed and buried. Critics have a hard time explaining why His following and faith grew by leap and bounds, of course!      Truth has become relative, depending on circumstances. Sociologists and psychologists term it situation ethics today. But Jesus said Thy Word is Truth! (John 17:17). Fortunately, in this country to be a Christian is still considered honorable. But to obey the scriptures implicitly, to try to follow the teachings of Jesus, to live as He did, to accept all the Bible as a guide book of life, is considered being just a bit way out, odd, different, fanatical. Yet many of this worlds problems could be solved if mankind would only . . . earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints (Jude 3).  |`|82e0091087399517f60d1dca806570acaa	Your nickname proves its contradictions ...... yes, many contradictions within the Bible|`|36200341c4743f875edb4a0e98cf52ccaa	Not true!|`|8076b945cafebd634cc12fdea0a9f47faa	Dude yes it does nothing but Way too many to name but i'll name one in the begining Adam and eve are the first ppl or whatever right? later somewhere it says that screwing your brother or sister is a sin but then how did Adam and eve keep ppl alive if that was true?Sorry but the bible is one big story book and in my opinion if your gonna belive in god belive your own way not what they tell you (Church government)|`|7e0cfb25fb3b90501480a2b7b9bc28c7aa	God of War or Peace?  EXO 15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.  ROM 15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.    Who was at the Empty Tomb?   MAT 28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.  MAR 16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.  JOH 20:1 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.    Jesus' last words?  Matt.27:46,50: "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost."  Luke23:46: "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, unto thy hands I commend my spirit:" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."  John19:30: "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished:" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."    Years of famine  II SAMUEL 24:13: So God came to David, and told him, and said unto him, shall SEVEN YEARS OF FAMINE come unto thee in thy land? or will thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue. thee?  I CHRONICLES 21:11: SO God came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee. Either THREE YEARS OF FAMINE or three months to be destryed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee;    The GENEALOGY OF JESUS?  In two places in the New Testament the genealogy of Jesus son of Mary is mentioned. Matthew 1:6-16 and Luke 3:23-31. Each gives the ancestors of Joseph the CLAIMED husband of Mary and Step father of Jesus. The first one starts from Abraham(verse 2) all the way down to Jesus. The second one from Jesus all the way back to Adam. The only common name to these two lists between David and Jesus is JOSEPH, How can this be true? and also How can Jesus have a genealogy when all Muslims and most Christians believe that Jesus had/has no father.    God be seen?  Exod. 24:9,10; Amos 9:1; Gen. 26:2; and John 14:9   God CAN be seen:  "And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my backparts." (Ex. 33:23)  "And the Lord spake to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend." (Ex. 33:11)  "For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." (Gen. 32:30)  God CANNOT be seen:  "No man hath seen God at any time." (John 1:18)  "And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me and live." (Ex. 33:20)  "Whom no man hath seen nor can see." (1 Tim. 6:16)      OK I think that's enough for now.     But you get the idea.|`|61ebe4addd6611685b44dd9001c0c83faa	Here are a few inconsistencies from many which Donald Morgan compiled :    GE 1:3-5 On the first day, God created light, then separated light and darkness.  GE 1:14-19 The sun (which separates night and day) wasn't created until the fourth day.    GE 1:11-12, 26-27 Trees were created before man was created.  GE 2:4-9 Man was created before trees were created.    GE 1:20-21, 26-27 Birds were created before man was created.  GE 2:7, 19 Man was created before birds were created.    GE 1:24-27 Animals were created before man was created.  GE 2:7, 19 Man was created before animals were created.    GE 1:26-27 Man and woman were created at the same time.  GE 2:7, 21-22 Man was created first, woman sometime later.    GE 1:28 God encourages reproduction.  LE 12:1-8 God requires purification rites following childbirth which, in effect, makes childbirth a sin. (Note: The period for purification following the birth of a daughter is twice that for a son.)    GE 1:31 God was pleased with his creation.  GE 6:5-6 God was not pleased with his creation.  (Note: That God should be displeased is inconsistent with the concept of omniscience.)    The following link is the whole compilation of the inconsistencies & contradictions.

For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.      11If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?      12If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.      Matthew 26:41  Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.      John 6:63  It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.    Romans 7:18  For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.    Romans 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.    Romans 8:5  For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.    Romans 8:8  So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.|`|f8ff1f4ae6939ca181d099d16c1e3c23aa	God will always forgive you for sins no matter if they are the same ones or not.  Remember God knows your heart and really knows if you are trying to correct your sins after you confess.  God will also Allow consequences for your sins to happen.  So the more you sin, the more you will have to deal with.  The way you get to heaven is not by confessing your sins alone.  You MUST accept Jesus as your Savior.. He is your way to heaven|`|AA10691438	Who said you cant be forgiven for the same sin twice?

God doesn't play off a strict set of complicated rules because he sees into our whole being. He would know if we are sincere.    if you commit a sin, ask for forgivness and receive it, then do it all again later, i think sincereity is the only thing that matters to God. I think in cases where a person is "incapable" of stopping themselves, God would fix them somehow in the end, as long as they felt sincerely sorry.|`|391078c2889299315d62a354ddb46c04aa	No. It doesn't work that way. You are only forgiven when you repent of your sin. Repentance means, you turn away from your sin, and  put your trust in Jesus.   Here's some bible verse   Matt. 18:2-4 ; Luke 13:5 ; Matt 4:17 ; Acts 17:30-31 ; John 3:3  Some people think that they are Christian and they are save. But going to chuch every sunday and just believe in Jesus won't make you a Christian. The demon also believe in Jesus, but they're not save.  You have to obey God, live a holy live, and do all things for the glory of God.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	There is a lot of confusion on the matter of forgiveness in Christianity.  We have to realise that God has forgiven us of all our sins, past, present or future when Jesus suffered God's judgement for our sins on the cross.  We are forgiven of all our sins when we confessed Jesus Christ as our Savior and God puts His righteousness in us and make us all saints.  Once you are cleansed by the blood of Jesus you are no longer a sinner but a saint who can sin. But God has given His saints the abundance of grace and His gift of righteousness to overcome sin.  So by ONE CONFESSION of faith in Jesus Christ we have cleared our sin position with God for all eternity.  There is no longer any need for us to confess our sins to God for He has cleared us of all divine judgement by the blood of Jesus,  However if we sin against other persons we have to confess our sins to them to obtain their forgiveness.  The book of James advocates that we confess our sin to one another and be healed.  Jesus has also touched on this when He said that when someone repents to you you should forgive him many times. 1 John 1:5-9 deals deals with our walk on earth and our conduct with one another which should always be in the light.  1 John 1:9 should be read as 'If we confess our sins (to one another), ....'  The Apostle John is stating the obvious for God has forgiven us all our sins by Jesus' death on the cross.  But the point is we must forgive one another to make our life on earth a heavenly one.  No, any unconfessed sin on earth to the one whom you have offended will make your life more unenjoyable on earth but you will not lose your salvation which has been paid for by grace by the blood of Jesus.|`|AA12393700	Prayers do not work without my written consent.|`|fb9a8c9746c64469f59da66b364747adaa	To be forgiven you have to be truly sorry for the sin, and endeavor to prevent further sins: "... I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin."|`|cc8be8879f58b36f69c4d72aac278defaa	God will forgive your sin if you are truly penitent. Those who seek forgiveness for a particular sin, usually do not commit that sin again if they are truly sorry for that sin. But we are human and do falter. Ask your guardian angel to help you when you are tempted to sin and then listen to him. Cheating on your husband is in itself more than just one sin. You have sinned against your vows to your husband and to God. To bread a vow is a grievous matter, and should be avoided at any cost.|`|a2cb112aa3ad82238aecbc1ade5bdbf7aa	You can be forgiven as long as you ask, but you are suppose to repent; which means to not commit that sin again, so you are to confess that sin to God and repent, not doing it again.  If someone is continuously sinning and asking forgiveness they need to be filled with the holy spirit, which our helper (John 14:16-17)  So if one is filled then there is always a voice assisting us to do what is right, but we do have our our free will and if we go against God's plans for us we grieve the Holy Spirit. Read Acts 2:38; 1:8; 2:4; Acts 5:32;   ephesians 4:22-32 & eph. 5.   There is soooo much more, I hope and pray that this helps you.  Yes, we are forgiven if we ask but not all of us will get heaven/eternity, unless we love like God loves (unconditionally,...thy neighbor...) and do His works to edify him.  So w/out prayer and the Holy Spirit, you'll be justa hopin and a wishin things will turn around for you....God Bless you!!!!!!  Ask God to fill you w/ the Holy Spirit and watch things start to turn around for you, you'll think twice about continuously commiting whatever sin.  Love you.|`|AA10641825	Jesus said you must forgive seven times seven.  So there.

In the Gospel of St. Matthew there is the following exchange between Jesus and Peter.      "Then Peter came to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?  Till seven times?    "Jesus saith unto him, say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, until seventy times seven."  (St. Matthew 18:21,22)    Now I once heard a sermon on this very same subject as a child and it's funny that I still remember it.  In fact the preacher told a joke using this passage as his reference.  It had something to do with a little boy wanting to know how many times he had to forgive a friend or younger brother, etc.  The little boy in this story took this passage literally and came to the conclusion that he would indeed forgive the offender 490 times, but on the 491st time he was really going to let the other boy have it.  I remember everyone getting a good laugh out of this one.    The point is, God knows that we're weak in our flesh and have our "favorite" sins that are hard to break once and for all.  In the book of Romans the apostle Paul talks about the continual conflict of good and evil that is being waged within our flesh.    "For I know that in me (that is, my flesh) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.  For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."  (Romans 7:18,19)    King David put it like this in one of his many Psalms.  Keep in mind here that the word fear connotates an attitude of reverence and awe for God.      "He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.  For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.  As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us."  (Psalm 103: 10-12)

Si una mujer no tiene esa opcion y el aborto no esta disponible en una manera legal o segura cosas terribles pueden pasar. Mas educacion es necesaria y mas recursos preventativos. Cuando el aborto es usado como un metodo anti contraceptivo eso esta mal.

Cuando el aborto es involuntario no peca contra nada, pero cuando es voluntario es un crimen, un asesinato, una limitacin al derecho de nacer. El cuarto Mandamiento de la Ley de Dios dice: !!!NO MATARS!!!. Desde el primer instante de la concepcin, cuando el espermatozoide fecunda el vulo, en ese preciso instante inicia su vida el embrin.

Pero si la madre no puede cuidar a su propio hijo (raro, verdad?)? Bueno, que lo d en adopcin, hay tantas instituciones que se encargan de ubicar a ni?os con parejas que desean adoptarlos... No lo apruebo, pero por lo menos no se ensuciara las manos con la sangre de SU PROPIO HIJO.

Satan can use people to fortell the future and so on to.  If it doesn't add up to scripture exactly, then it isn't from God.

In my opinion, what he could do I know it can be difficult- is keep aside his sexual trends for the time being so that his father may regain confidence in him and at least, allow him to get a degree in some career or other. And when he has finally being able to start an independent life of his own then he will be able to openly show his sexuality in South Africa or wherever he chooses to live.  After all, there are thousands of young men that do not start having any sexual activity until they get married, although you may find it hard to believe, and that means finishsing their studies first and finding a job afterwards.

Personal experiences may vary but it's something we all have in common. It's easier to share,  offer opions and advise on this topic which is why questions regarding sex generate more answers. Sexuality is a natural fact of life which is why the subject is taken seriously. On the other hand, depending on the topic, issues you consider to be more "serious" may be outside of another participant's realm.

AA11674285	Logotheraphy is a therapy through meaning or a meaning centered therapy. Its chief exponent was V. Frankl. It has nothing to do with Scientology of Hubbard which is a cult, though projected by its founder as a 'new religion'.|`|AA11024478	Logotherapy is a form of psychotherapy derived from Abraham Maslow's concept of self-actualization.|`|3b88de51744f4e66d076a4c383dcae08aa	Yes it does, it is part of their system.

But it's made with the greek "Logos" meaning word, speech. It's a personal development treatment using words, you speak, you hear, you find solutions by yourself.|`|834fa78e6e75fb34ae28e51916e6546baa	What is Logotherapy?    THIS IS SCIENTOLOGY    1. What is true for you is what you yourself observe to be true.    2. Man is his spirit not his mind or his body.     3. The spirit creates his own mind. Please, do not confuse the mind with the brain that is a physical thing. The mind is composed of mental image pictures as explained in Dianetics. These pictures serve the spirit to give him knowledge and experience. These pictures are composed of energy. The energy in the picture can affect the spirit. You can feel better by remembering something that you like or angry by remembering something else. These emotions are actually energy waves emanated by the picture. You can actually feel pain by remembering a pain memory. Sometimes these pictures are accompanied by ideas or considerations. Lets suppose that you father beat you mom up in front of you. Your father was the dominating figure so you might conclude that you have to act like your father in some situations. This is what we call on Scientology an aberration (a conclusion that is imposed to you by a mental picture). This picture is what we call a engram (a pain memory that affects your judgment and free will).     4. You can discharge the energy in these pictures through communication. This is Dianetics Auditing and is the oldest of hundreds of Scientology techniques used to improve the individual.     5. The Spirit creates his own emotions. Are you happy? Are you sad? Are you depress? Maybe you think that something external of you is creating your emotions. Maybe you believe that you are sad because you had a bad day or maybe you believe that you are happy because you had a great day. And this might be true. But who made the decision that you had a good or bad day? You did. You decided if life was good or bad, and adjusted your emotions to respond to your own consideration. You created your own emotion.   Some people are born with everything they want and are still unhappy. And others are born into humble means and are happy. What's the difference? The only real difference is each person's ideas and considerations.  Scientology uses hundreds of processes in order to help a person get a better understanding and a better outlook in life by using his own observations.    6. Scientology Ethics. Ethical people take full responsibility for their actions. Un-ethical people blame others for their actions. "Wrong doings" diminish and deteriorate the freedom of the spirit because the need to justify the "wrong doing". So the spirit is enslaved into repeating the "wrong doing" in order to justify the original "wrong doing". The road to freedom lies within taking full responsibility for your personal condition and actions, past, present and future. Scientology provides the tools to help the person able to be fully responsible over his life thus rehabilitating his ability to be good and self determined.   Also Scientologist base their conduct on a non-denominational code of conduct. http://twth.org/eb/?id=16664j    7. Scientology and God. Scientology acknowledges the supreme being and promotes the individual search for closeness to God trough religion.     8. Scientology vs Psychiatry. Psychiatry believes that self awareness, feelings, love and faith is merely cellular activity. Basically they think that you are your brain and you are not in charge of your behavior but your cells are.This is a totally materialistic point of view that denies the spirit and God. Psychiatrist is a pseudo science because it is based in principles that are false. Psychiatry have never proven that any "mental illnesses" (like they call it) has any connection with a physical illness. Any Neurologist will tell you  there are no medical test to identify a "mental illness". All Psychiatrists base their diagnosis on opinion and opinion alone.  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...  http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?p=cchr...  Happiness, exhilaration, depression and psychosis are states of mind, not diseases. All what you have to do to stop being depress is change your state of mind. How you do that? By changing your ideas and considerations. Scientology provides the tools to achieve a better state of mind in accordance with your own point of view.   Also Psychiatrist excuse the most horrendous crimes as mental illnesses. This is actually creates a sense of irresponsibility in society because it tells people that they are not responsible for their actions. Second they promote that drugs are the answer for your problems. This message promotes the use of drugs to find release from life and creates the current drug addiction problem in society. Drugs will only give you temporary false release but will never solve the source of your problems.And actually drugs will keep you away from finding a true spiritual release.   http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...  Note: Scientology doesn't have anything against Psychology or Neurology. Also the mere awareness that you are a spiritual being and not a body makes you better person.    9. Scientology is a force for good in society. Scientologist fights Psychiatry, http://www.cchr.org/ the drug companies, criminality, http://www.crimino|`|AA10040602	I don't know if this is what you are talking about, but "logotherapy" was the word that Viktor Frankl used to describe his method of psychotherapy which depended on helping clients discover and embrace meaning in their own life through loving other people, doing good work, and enduring undeserved suffering.    It's not related to scientology.

The one I remember best was the old man - who must have just passed himself - asking me to help his son.  From what I learned, the son accidentally shot himself to death about age 8, and had not known he was dead or passed on. (That would have been in the early 1970s, and I was helping him in 2001) I helped him get to a place where a group of other children were waiting, and they said they'd take him on from there.    yes, I have strong visualization skills.

AA11115233	incest|`|AA11297113	It is a need to know thing, and we don't really need to know.|`|aa31c3b9e60704382f19c38af231f597aa	Adam and Eve have daughters, to marry a sister at that time was not prohibited by God because they were still close to perfection and it would not create problems with offsprings (deformities, abnormalities). Now in our times, it is not allowed since too much imperfection will bring too much abnormalities.    Noah's sons have wives and they bore children and so on and so on....|`|c04c66fe2f7520a305d4676ca06e8647aa	Where did Cain get his wife if there was just one family?    Gen. 3:20: Adam called his wifes name Eve, because she had to become the mother of everyone living. (So all humans were to be the offspring of Adam and Eve.)    Gen. 5:3, 4: Adam lived on for a hundred and thirty years. Then he became father to a son in his likeness, in his image, and called his name Seth. And the days of Adam after his fathering Seth came to be eight hundred years. Meanwhile he became father to sons and daughters. (One of Adams sons was Cain, and one of Adams daughters must have become Cains wife. At that time in human history when humans still had outstanding physical health and vitality, as indicated by the length of their lives, the likelihood of passing on defects as a result of marrying a close relative was not great. After some 2,500 years of human history, however, when mankinds physical condition had greatly deteriorated, Jehovah gave to Israel laws forbidding incest.)    Gen. 4:16, 17: Cain went away from the face of Jehovah and took up residence in the land of Fugitiveness [or, Nod] to the east of Eden. Afterward Cain had intercourse with his wife [knew his wife, that is, intimately so, KJ, RS; lay with his wife, NE] and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. (Notice that Cain did not first meet his wife in the land to which he fled, as if she were from another family. Rather, it was there that he had sexual relations with her to produce a son.)     This was the only way to populate the earth. After a time God didn't let this happen anymore. Now it is incest.|`|3801509a638a40adec83cece8e688f9aaa	Cain married his sister, etc. There were no  laws on incest until the Mosaic Law in 1513 BCE. Adam was created in 4026 bce.

Then he became father to a son in his likeness, in his image, and called his name Seth. 4?And the days of Adam after his fathering Seth came to be eight hundred years.

6726ab4db050b97723888159c82c2be1aa	It is stated in the Bible that God will reveal himself to you if you ask...perhaps that maybe why small/personal Miracles happen?  As far as "ignoring" genocide and famine that is quite off.  We are God's children he feels every tear.  But I have a question for you !!  Where would you stop the pain and suffering?  Would the line be at 5,000 people in a disaster?  Or how about no rape or child molestation!  These issues are big problems but how can the line be drawn?  It will always look to be "to much pain and suffering" and therefore people will state their can not be a loving God because these things happen!  That is far from the truth!  This is not Heaven and we can not see the big picture of why things happen!  Quick example ...You need to look at it as say a less inteligent creature compared to your knowledge.  Say you were walking on the beach and came across a sea gull caught in  some fish line, you approach the bird to help however with its limited knowledge it would believe you are going to hurt it!  You grab a hold of it frimly and now it knows for sure you are going to hurt it...as you untangle the fishing line some of the line cuts its leg and now it was hurt by you!!  but you untangle the line and let it free....you saw the big picture! You even had to cause the bird some pain and discomfort however it was the best thing for the bird and you new that a head of time the bird even after being set free still might think you were trying to hurt it!  Same concept with God, we do not see the big picture, comparitvely speaking, and therefore will view things in our limited view as wrong and as a threat while all along they were in our best interest.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	"He" does neither.|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Why do you believe that GOD has ignored anything?  You evidentally have not been reading your BIBLE, have you?  HE knows the number of hairs on your head.  Remember that Satan is the evil one.  He alone would be a part of genocide and famine today.  GOD has no part in it.  GOD answers prayers.  Sometimes that answer is still "NO".  We have to be ready to do what we can to assist those in need.  Whether they are next door to us or around the globe.  That is what GOD expects of us.  Have a great week!  Eds|`|c6ed324bb70246f047e05d3ca9d5e4fdaa	Who says small, personal miracles have been performed and by a god?|`|AA10099061	once again....    God has no children. God has created.    God is All Powerful. The word if and God should not be used in the same context.    God has given his creation(humans) the ability and the sustenance to live this life successfully. God has created enough money and food to support all living beings. Suffering comes from our own actions or non-actions(ex.:Sudan, Ethiopia,etc.) $200.00 dollar shoes and a 1.5 million dollar home is not worth anything if those around you are suffering, you are wearing their food and that house can shelter many families. Its really simple, those who TRY to blame God are cowards and should look in the mirror.|`|342128c86856dd4c93d170774e719e35aa	i don't believe in a high in the sky god.  i don't think god grants any miracles.  i think that we have the capacity to influence our own lives.  we are all made of energy and thought is a form of energy (look up some quantum physics, it's even proven by science..), so if you want something really badly and truly believe it will happen, you can actually change the energetic pattern of what's around you, and possibly cause a "miracle."    i think if everyone in the world decided we all actually wanted peace (and it didn't come with strings attached like we all have to be of a certain religion or do everything a certain way), we could fix things like genocide and famine.  famine we could fix right now, if we all got together and decided to do it....    To "minister of peace."  Genocide existed before there was a population problem, and we now have a population problem that neither genocide or famine are "fixing."  How heartless and uncompassionate; these people are our BROTHERS AND SISTERS, they are humans just like us.  And if it was your family or children all of the sudden in a worn-torn country being chased or maimed or raped or starving to death, I bet your attitude would change in a heartbeat.  It is attitudes like yours that contribute to the non-solution of these problems.|`|7bad913c266111abb401acbd851505b6aa	he doesn't ignore them. people have no faith. they really do not.    how can a dentist fix your toothache if you dont go to him and listen to what he says???      how is god supposed to help the world when the world rjects him???|`|50b6ebb4ba12a7e7f094be06c48d18faaa	Concrete Jungle    No sun will shine in my day today; (no sun will shine)  The high yellow moon won't come out to play:  (that high yellow moon won't come out to play)  I said (darkness) darkness has covered my light,  (and the stage) And the stage my day into night, yeah.

Humans are certainly NOT doing anything about it by practicing birth control.  People are living longer.  Just like the animal kingdom, cats kill rats...etc.  That's just the way it is.  God is in control.|`|6d289ceff24b9fed89b10a651a228cfaaa	God has granted "small, personal miracles" to .0000001% of the population of the world, the vast majority of which were concentrated on the ancient Jews. Even the vast majority of people who lived in Bible times didn't get a miracle.    Why do humans ignore genocide and famine? God works through His people, the Christian church. We have more than enough food to feed everyone on earth, it's just not distributed properly.     Short answer: Humans' actions have consequences. If God removed the consequences to those actions, we would no longer truly have free will, because we would be unable to choose those consequences. If you are not satisfied with the way the world is, instead of complaining that God let it be that way, try going out and doing something about it yourself.|`|AA10824151	He wants to let us fend for ourselves but will grant those with faith many things.

Jesus said something interesting in a certain context. I will just quote or actually praphrase it.  He said , "There were many lepers is Namaans day but only Namaan was healed, there were many widows in Elisha's day but he was only sent to one" totally loose paraphrase  I think that at least shows that the Jesus was aware of such things, and it did not disturb or overthrow his knowledge of God.  It certainly does not answer it but it shows that such an honest awareness is not incompatible with devotion to God through Jesus Christ.|`|cc67950624057dc522dc69ca4dd78a98aa	God annot interfere too much with his creation, that would eliminate its purpose.|`|AA11139065	Why do you say he's ignoring them?

He loves us enough to give us time to figure it out ourselves, sadly though many people are deceived and don't believe they need help.|`|AA12059706	I was told the reason God allows death and suffering is to let humans prove they are not fit to and cannot rule themselves.  Here we have tried almost every form of government, and so far none have worked as well as we'd like.    Now, God wants to help us; for that reason He grants personal miracles.  Yet, He must allow humans to convince themselves of the aforementioned point.    If God were to end the suffering, there would be people who in the hereafter would argue, "Well, humans could have done just fine ruling themselves, had we been allowed to try a direct democracy."  God is giving us free will, but letting us prove to ourselves that we are best in His hands.    At least, that's what I was told.|`|ce394cc3237a1b9e9ba8b97e22c195dfaa	Haha, lol and other words of laugh.    Christianity has a bloody history.|`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	What do you mean?  Certainly many people are saved from genocide and famine.  Nonetheless, these things result from mankind not acting in a diversity of unity upon God's Law.
3fd61e7c7bd655a7a125d6e73f164a74aa	I like your 360. Brad Pitt, definitely.    My experiences were similar. About 13 or 14 I began to understand that this was not a phase I was going through. I hated high school and loved it at the same time. It put me in such close proximity to so many beautiful classmates that I got hard in the showers and was scared to death that anyone would find me out. It was a small town with provincial attitudes toward such things. But who could help look at their swinging steaks and smooth, toned bodies. I don't mean to make this sound like pornography. That isn't the point. But it'd be a lie not to describe what I felt then.  I didn't know a thing about the outside world at the time, so the things I felt were mine alone. There was no-one in whom to confide and no-one who I knew who was gay too. It wasn't much fun.  I sort of developed a neurosis about school and refused to go and was sent to a psychiatrist to discover what really was the matter. There is no point seeing a doctor if you don't tell him what is wrong, so I blabbed everything. The man turned out to be my salvation. After not too many sessions, perhaps five or six, we decided that the best course of action was to elicit the help of my folks and bring them in on the next session and spill the beans. I was outed by my psychiatrist at 16 and have never looked back in regret.  My parents were cool about the whole thing and it really came as no surprise, like they knew all along. My dad especially. Once I'd gotten over that hurdle, everything else just fell into place.  I'm glad that you asked this question and hope this is of some help to you. I don't much talk about coming out or teenage angst.|`|AA11893109	I knew I felt strongly about boys and not strongly about girls at 8 -- I realized it was sexual at 11 -- I started having sex (yay!) at a late 13 with my best friend - and started coming out then.      I did experiment once, at the urging of fundie friends who were "worried" about me, at 15, with a close female friend -- I'm glad it was a close friend, cause it disgusted me so much I threw up -- a less close friend would not have forgiven me -- as it was she was basically like "NOW do you believe you are gay?"  -- which of course inside I always knew, if my friends hadn't meddled, I wouldn't have bothered with the experiment even the once, I had no questions.  They were just so worried about me, and so intent, they wanted me to "turn straight" and assured me that once I let my d**k touch a p****, I would instantly be one of them, actually, I was just totally nauseated and just as gay as before.  After that they were sort of puzzled, shrugged, and gave up -- some of them are still my friends.    Interestingly, by some of the criteria used in some of the more extremely heterosexually oriented studies, this one horrible experience means I can be counted as straight or bisexual.  I wonder what it would do to the numbers if they counted every boi who ever had his friend play with or s**k his d**k as gay???.    Kind regards,    Reyn  believeinyou24@yahoo.com|`|b70599a0829dd4deed571c9132f73590aa	Looking back...I was never really attracted to the opposite sex.  I had no bad experience with men....just felt nothing sexually for them.  I didn't know anyone openly gay/lesbian growing up.  And this wasn't something that was ever discussed in my family.  I saw the stereotypes on TV and in movies....and they were usually all negative....people that were made fun of and laughed at.  Maybe that's why I didn't come the the realization until I was 18.   I was in college and had a huge crush on a gal I had a few classes with.  We were good friends, and she was terminally straight...so, I never said anything to her.  But, I suppose not having any positive role models or knowing anyone gay growing up is what kept me from "coming out" to myself until then.  It took a while to overcome the fear and accept myself.  But now I am out and accepted by my friends, family and co-workers.  And I have a wonderful partner as well!|`|b930d8ffd4756e4f1c3d9392ce4446d4aa	It was kind of the same with me.  I always was more interested in looking at guys when I was growing up, girls just didn't do anything for me.  So, I kept pushing the feelings back thinking that it was a phase or something.  Then I started dating girls in high school, trying to hide my gayness, but I just didn't get anything out of the relationships.  So, I went off to college, and the experimentation started...  That's when I finally realized that I was 100% gay.|`|c05bf4da3b7044de6b1fa61000f2905caa	I didn't want to admit or see I was bisexual. I played around with the word when I was 16, believing and hoping it was a sort of phase or a game. But when moments came that I thought I may really be bisexual I got scared and pushed it out my mind.    I only admitted it to myself a couple of months ago when for some reason I got a big surge of anger after accidentally seeing a picture of a girl that I thought was hot [though couldn't admit it to myself] - I told my boyfriend who helped me through the self-hate and guilt from this and now I am fine!|`|AA10080206	I guess I knew on some level at around 8-9, started to understand it around 15, and finally accepted it around 19.|`|0b41690c5eaa4faaaff0f51ac0c30f2aaa	Same exact thing you said earlier.  Except I was too chickenshit to experiment till i was 23!!  Probably for the best though as I totally made up for it.  I knew I was gay the first time I had this crush on a guy in high school.  i swear I was like a stalker!!  I would go to his house "he was 2yrs older" and I would do anything and everything to be around him.  I even had a chance at one time but was to scared to act on it.  I set him up with this girl who he married and had children with and I wasn't even invited to the wedding.  To this day he is the only one I didn't come out too.  How strange is that!  By the way they are still married and that was in 90 I set them up.  Still love the guy but have nothing in common with him.|`|c66e2311e0a9ed421adc685d5393783daa	Looking back I could remember since I was five or six that I had crushes on my neighbor's cousin. He was in his teens at the time. I had underessed him in my eyes, even at that age, just wishing to see what was down there. This kept happening over the years with teachers and friends.    When I was 13 and realized what all of this meant. The first time I heard the word homosexual and what it meant I realized what was going on with me. But looking at the way homsexuals are treated in the society, I denied that it was me, that I was gay. I struggled through out highschool, trying to play is straight, I just isolated myself and got busy with studying. I made up stories about having a girlfriend who didn't go to the same school as me.    When I hit college I just played it low but it got really frustrating and I started to harm myself by engaging in distructive behavior. When I was 19 I tried to commint suicide, but then I realized that it wasn't my fault that I was gay. And the only reason why I was hiding myself was because I wanted approval, approval of the society, the family. Now a year later I have accepted myself to some extent, and am happier than ever before. :-)|`|d38ce3b4e311854364c784c2028f7253aa	David Duchovny was my first love.  We'll call that 6th grade.

Yo tambien he tenido el mismo problema que tu, pero hay que salir adelante. Yo tengo novio y creeme que como muchos de lo que te comentan aqui lo que vale esta en tu interior y no en tu exterior. Y claro que hay gays que se vincularian contigo con esas caractersticas, te comento que yo tengo amigos y muchos sufren de acne, estrias, de sobrepeso pero eso es lo de menos, a mi me encanta estar con ellos porque me la paso muy bien.|`|ab4c2090b0a3a8ae88cfc02741f67a2baa	Mira, considero que el fsico no lo es todo en la vida, si bien, no te voy a decir que uno se esfuerza por encontrar a alguien que le parezca intelectual y fsicamente atractivo, yo en lo personal, prefiero a las personas que me atraen por su forma de ser, era un poco ms fro, superficial, etc. pero he aprendido que no lo es todo en la vida...

Mi razn es la siguiente: a m lo que me parece insoportable es una persona acomplejada. Hay personas guapas, de buen fsico que estn inconformes... quieren otra nariz, quieren pesar menos, quieren ms msculo, quieren abdomen plano... siempre estn machacando con eso... Y aunque le eches algn piropo har notar aquellos aspectos de su fsico que le gustaran y deben mejorar... y sabes? a la larga una persona as cansa.    Igual y no soy una belleza, pero a m mi pareja me hace perderme entre las nubes (OK, me levanta la autoestima ca?on) si me dice que tengo lindas manos o que mis cejas se ven bien. Y ella es an menos agraciada fsicamente que yo... pero tiene detalles que me encantan... y sabes, ms que el fsico, qu es lo que me gusta de ella? que est conforme con lo que es y con cmo es... y cero complejos.     Yo creo que s puedes encontrar alguien que te quiera as... pero sacdete ese complejo... Y vers que si t te gustas... sin dificultad le gustas a alguien ms.

Si ests haciendo ejercicio, dentro de poco vas a ver resultados, y eso te va a hacer sentir todava mas seguro. Lo del acn, hay miles de tratamientos para controlarlo y eliminarlo, si tu piel es muy grasosa lo mejor es que veas a un dermatlogo para que te de un tratamiento y elimine algunas cosas de tu dieta, las estras... si bien no son muy agradables, nadie las nota!    Ahora, recuerda que lo mas importante es estar seguro de uno mismo, no importa si eres delgado o gordito, asi como los ves, hay gente con cuerpazo que no tiene autoestima. Mientras te pones en forma por fuera, ponte en forma por dentro! Trata de conocer gente, diviertete, hazte de cultura general y mantente enterado de lo que pasa en el mundo, para que tengas una pltica amena y amplia. Ten f en ti mismo y no te fijes en la gente cerrada que te quiera rechazar o te haga el feo, bien dicen que hay que besar muchos sapos para encontrar al principe azul...    Mucho xito y mantente firme en tu objetivo, feliz 2007!!|`|adb3e8890f2888c787a6ab8e5aa96521aa	Oye, si crees que alguien va a decirte si saldra o no contigo solo por tu fsico, estas mal amigo...

I don't buy into that vibe.    Its all about geography and what you are most comfortable with.    And check the stats on federal prisons. Blacks are still the minority.|`|08dde0b80d8be353010d2f5f48aa56b0aa	Are you serious?  LoL, I'm a white girl, raised in the south...but let me tell you something...the white people in prison are there because they are crazy.  They're the ones with all the mental problems.  I'd feel safer in a JAIL CELL with 10 black people than with one white man.  Probably all those black people are only in there because they smoked some reefer and got caught...but the white man cowering in the corner....yeah, he's a cannibal.  Also, have you ever considered that African Americans are more likely to be convicted of crimes, not necessarily more likely to COMMIT them?  Perhaps this is because, according to statistics, many african americas that are put on trial cannot afford their own lawyers, or because people in general (like you) feel that a black person is more capable of committing a crime than a white person.  Honestly, if you put a "black thug" and a white man in a suit beside each other and say "Who done it?!"  everyone's going to point to the black man.  In fact, he could just be a good Christian 'brotha on his way to a church retreat, while the white man could be smuggling money from his company.    All in all, I feel confidant enough in myself, believing that all people are mostly good, to feel safe no matter what the race of the person standing beside me in line at the convenient store is.

This is the truth and it does not matter if you believe it or not!  There is nothing except Perfection which is pre-determined!  Someday all individual will make that choice to outpicture that reality.|`|4c728797bf9e60be9774554e6143ece3aa	I think that it depends on the person. Just because you are raised in poverty doesn't mean that you cannot rise above it. Just go see the new Will Smith movie and you will see what I mean.|`|AA11452268	To some extent, poverty is an inherited disease, but an environmentally inherited disease, not a biologically inherited one. If you are surrounded by wretchedness your whole life, it is hard to get excited about the opportunities of the future. The human mind just doesn't work that way: it overgeneralizes patterns. Therefore if the pattern up to the present has been full of disappointment, lack of opportunity, and failure, the mind decides that that is all that will exist in the future as well. There are certain individuals who manage to succeed in spite of being raised in an environment of poverty and abuse, but it is a much harder, longer road than it is for the average middle-class American, and hence it is much easier to get frustrated and give up somewhere along the way.    Some Mexicans pay taxes; some don't. Some are legal; some are not. Some of the illegal ones who don't pay taxes and who get paid "under the table" also don't claim benefits because they're too afraid to interact with the government on any level. Even then, they're usually getting paid way less than an American would, so the money that should go towards taxes actually goes into the pocket of the company that hires them. You don't really think that illegal Mexicans are the only ones benefitting from this system, do you?

I don't know, I just know I don't need sex, the sex drive goes away with time....If you want someone, just want a guy and you'll see there's probably not many guys you really want, because if you want a guy you should want his sperm too, logically, sorry for speaking so direct, but that's how I see it.

If not, leave it alone, if so... Go for it, you have nothing to lose as of right now anyway right? I mean, he is only a trainer/friend right now, if you ask him out on a date you don't have anything to lose. I think you should just ask him to work out together sometime first... then after hanging out, just the two of you, maybe ask him on a date, see what he says... I do think you need to prepare yourself for a "no" but there are also a lot of guys out there... Good luck.|`|e98866b085ffa2485ad7691411d0206caa	First bit of advice, would be to leave him alone.

Just keep to yourself, and avoid answering any questions, unless you feel comfortable in doing so. Work is not the place to date anyway. And, you dont have to change the way you work. You also need to control any urges you have to make moves on the guys. Only because you could end up getting charged with sexual harassment. The old tale goes "Dont poop where you eat".

Its as though you and I are the same person, because I have been dealing with the very same feelings.  I look lovingly at all the new young employees here at my job.  I try to mentor them and in so doing I find myself getting aroused.  I constantly think of what it would be like to make passionate love to these guys.  So far, I've been able to repress my obvious feelings but I wish so very much to take a couple of these men to my Vermont love nest and have a romantic weekend.  By the way, how old are you??? I have just started taking salt peter though and it is helping.  Maby you should try some.|`|e01195e4f58e1e119bce411de40a7691aa	Right, if you work in a homophobic environment I would personally not recommend that you come out. Some people would advise differently, but you have to ask yourself if you think it would make you happier.    It is much easier for people to come out in environments that are not homophobic, such as academia, creative industries, politics and charities.    Remember, it is perfectly normal to want to be friends with other men. You really should not feel guilty about this. Men do like the company of other men. That's a fact of life and nothing to do with being gay.    I would recommend that you should not go to the locker room just to talk to guys, because it breaks a social taboo. No straight guy would expect to talk to girls in the locker room.    If you actually want to change there, that is a totally different matter.    If you are mentoring new guys, that is a positive thing. If you happen to fancy them, that's your little secret. Sounds fun. Don't worry about it.    On the other hand you really really should not come onto straight men at work. They just aren't going to want a relationship. It will make things awkward.    You need to have relationships with men outside work. That really is much easier than you think. Try online dating, you will find that the poster gets a lot more responses than anyone who posts.

Take a walk through her room (with the camera) showing her crib, her favorite toy or teddy bear.    Take movies of the house and drive through the neighborhood taking pictures of the roads, trees, buildings, and open fields (if there are any left).      Then, get the movies that you took onto DVD, and keep them current with the technology of the day.  (If you recorded them on BETA format years ago, it would not be too helpful now - so keep upgrading to the current technology).    I would try to make it an hour long or so.  Interview your family about her - take pictures of Aunt Sue and Uncle Jim with the baby.      I can almost guarantee you that she will treasure this when she is 16, and the older she gets, the more she will treasure it.    And, one more thing.

Can you offer evidence that this statement is true?|`|AA10819547	Yes it would be nicer if we didn't have to listen to the usual rhetoric about adam and steve (oops typo) and how we're all going to be bronzing on sun loungers in hell with strawberry daiquiris in hand...    However, if we don't allow them this exposure to us, we might as well go back fifty years, where we should have to sneak about and use codes to identify one another "Is he musical?"...    Some straights have genuine questions - "my kid loves to dress up in his sister's clothes, how do I help him feel comfortable" is one, from a loving parent, that sticks with me.    Others, see relationships as relationships and provide sound advice on that basis.    Many want to understand our issues so that they are informed when it comes to their interactions with non-straights.     Don't  lump all the straights together - that makes you as bad as the trolls you're really complaining about.    I flipped in indecision for years, only accepting that I was Bi in my twenties.|`|b605d25d85af3c4abff6c0dfd990f16eaa	WOW!! So many questions all together.    My guess is that some straight people come here because they are gay-friendly, some others to insult gay people because they have nothing else to do with their lives.    I figured out that I am gay looooooooong time ago, it just took me a while to admit it to myself.    Try to associate with people who respect you, and don't waste too much time fighting with homophobic losers -- they take too much work!|`|2650c37abda85237990c112b4b23d3c9aa	I think the straights are curious about us.

I realized I was gay in elementary school.|`|e01195e4f58e1e119bce411de40a7691aa	When I was younger I used to explore the gay sections of Yahoo just to find out about my sexuality.    If you come from a small town or the country it can be absolutely impossible to find anyone that you can talk about your sexuality to.    We should welcome 'straight' people who have come here to find out about their sexuality and ask questions that might seem a bit weird to us. Like     'Am I gay?'  'What's it like to fancy a guy?'    Or even the old chestnut, 'Is it Ok for two guys to get it on?' Bless.    As for the gay haters, that's a complicated issue.... I PERSONALLY think they get an erotic thrill from it. Remember most of them are probably fairly young teenagers who have not worked out their sexuality yet.    We should hope that they do.|`|074d839dabd465814b650877d0daa2ceaa	Well, I don't like your generalization about "every straight thinks that gays are disgusting".      As you can see by my name here, I am NOT A LGBT, but I have never criticized gays.  If you look at any of my answers, you will see that I consider LGBT's to be my equal.  I know gay guys, bi's, lesbians and a transgendered people.  If you ask ANY of them how I treat them, they will tell you I treat them like I treat everyone else.    Just so you know for the future, I am here so that I can learn more about LGBT people.  I made a mistake a while ago with one of my LGBT friends, and almost ruined a great friendship.  It was through my ignorance of the LGBT community - and I don't want that to happen again.  Luckily, for me, my friend quickly realized that I didn't mean my actions as it seemed, and has forgiven me.  It really made me feel bad, and I decided to learn more about the LGBT community.    I do agree with you about SOME straights coming here and mouthing off, but do me a favor and don't clump us all together.    Thank You.|`|d24fb289a1dbb9a88988c1c6a5d99d27aa	Don't worry about it....ignore it....it happens to me too!

Because I wondered what was on gay people's minds.  Maybe I could answer something.    People criticize you?  Now, two questions pop into my mind.  Are you more sensitive to criticism because you are expecting someone to say something to you about being gay.  OR Are people being critical because you recently came out that you were gay?    Well, as far as the disgusting rant, please keep in mind that we cannot see ourselves doing the same activities.  Oral sex puts a lot of people off.  The whole oral/anal sex thing really makes most people want to spew including me.  I won't even get into the stuffing gerbils conversation...    I believe that every life has merit of some sort or another.  Because that life may not seem to be important to some, it can be very important to others to "correct" the lives of those who have strayed from the norm.    Homosexuality is generally seen by the straight religious community to not be a birth "defect", but rather a sin, rebellion against God.  The Bible states quite clearly that God hates homosexuality.   NOT HOMOSEXUALS.  Most God ignorant people, who for reasons of "helping God or serving God", will put up banners or chant slogans, "God hates (sorry for the verbage) Fags!!!"      God doesn't hate you.  He loves all humanity.  He went through life and died a humiliating, cruel death for humanity.  Why?  So that you could spend eternity with HIM!!!  So would that be representative of someone who hates you, that'd He'd die for you to have the opportunity to be with Him.    One guy wrote about laying bronzing on a lounge chair while sipping Pina Coladas in Hell.  Hell is not a sunny place on the beach where you relax or party.  It is a place of torment.  Why would Jesus save us from a "paradise"???    According to what the Bible says, "Only those who are born again(spiritually), will see the Kingdom of God."    Now, before you think that I'm pointing a finger of judgement towards homosexuals.  Be aware that adulterers, fornicators, drunkards, overeaters, etc.  (ie people who perform all sorts of sin) who are not born again.  They, too, will not see the Kingdom.of God.  It means that they have not repented (asked forgiveness and strive to turn away from that sin/rebellion)    The other point, I'm trying to make is that while you're taking criticism from others.  Remember this that God never said, "Browbeat someone into the Kingdom."  God offers it with a loving open hand.  That hand isn't slapping you in the face.      Those that are critical of your "rebellion" or "sin", more than likely are just as guilty of something else and turn a blind eye towards it.  So don't let those hypocrits hurt you.    Tell those hypocrits, "Put your own house in order, before you start trying to fix mine."   Most real Christians will never try to browbeat you into the Kingdom.  They realize that unless God opens your eyes to His reality.  It's pretty much pointless, but you never know who or when He'll allow those who's eyes are closed to open.  So He sends them out to speak to different people like lambs to the slaughter.    Be thankful that you were born/live in a "Christian" nation, other nations would have put you to death for saying, "I'm homosexual".  Or you could be forced to convert from homosexuality.    Thank God that He gave the Founding Fathers wisdom to protect you from others views(right and wrong).    I pray that you'll take true criticism to heart and become a stronger person.  I also pray that you'll look at those who are being critical and scornful with pity.  As Jesus said, "forgive them for they know not what they do."|`|2025358375791b661b15d2678842f401aa	Please don't generalise about any group of people. It weakens your point dramatically for a start and is seriously flawed, by being totally incorrect.  A few folks will critisize, that is the nature of life. You can't please all the people all the time. Not possible. If you managed to live a life that would please most Christians you would fall foul of Islamic beliefs or beliefs of various other religions. No matter what life you lead, critisism is available from many directions if you look for it.  In answer to your question, I think most of the striaght users are curious, interested, and genuine. There will be a few who want to argue, gay bash and spout religious nonsense (yes that's what I think of it) perhaps. However the majority of straight folks, religious or not, are likely to be quite tolerant and are simply curious. Or have a question.

Good luck : )|`|AA10920971	Well you don't give much to work with but... She seems to know your feelings for her. She can't deny you because she wants you as a friend.(rejection tends to break most bonds). You should consider any reasons she might have for staying close to you. Like the stereotype " I'm miserable and need a friend". If nothing really comes to mind there is a good chance she has "feelings for you" but has trouble coming to terms with it.

Should you discuss it?  Yes, I think you should.  Either (unlikely) he'll fall into your arms and you'll kiss passionately or he'll want to distance himself from you, helping you to overcome your crush and to find someone who'll reciprocate.|`|c9767c63fdfd33d112bdefa6e53f7d12aa	ya it is|`|AA10892283	You know, I believe a lot of people feel that way.

Stop calling people names like "jerk", it reflects badly on you and the perception people have of you; therefore, actually attracting the type of person you say you do not want in your life.
