20070321220734AAZRyPZ	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	What's the difference between a Honda Baja XR 250cc and a Honda XR 250cc?	Hi folks, I would like some advice and information with regards to Honda dirt-bikes.   I am living in Cambodia, a beautiful country with temples and stunning countryside. I am wanting to buy a dirt-bike to explore the country, and as most roads outside the capital are dirt, a dirt-bike is the best option.   Their are lots of different bikes for sale, from Japan, but I have been told a Honda is the best choice due to quality and maintenance.    My budget stretches to 2003 models. The two options are either  the "Honda XR 250cc", or the "Honda Baja XR 250cc".   Both bikes look very similar, but they must be different?    The engine, brakes, folks, exhaust etc. all look very similar.    The exterior/fascia are different...the Baja has a larger fuel tank and twin headlights and is black. The XR is red, with single headlamp and small tank.      Are these the only differences?    Or is their a difference in purpose and performance?    What bike would people recommend?       Thanks for the information and advice.

I only use a car for light errands and put about 2000 miles a year on a car.  How should I go about trading the convertible in at a used car dealership, should I be up front about the cost of repairs needed, say it's in need of repair and let them figure it out, or just keep my mouth shut and let them give a figure first?  I'm not trying to scam anyone, I just haven't ever gone thru this process before and need advice.  Thanks!

20090309144321AAdoqDr	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	When can I refinance my new-used car?	I went to a car dealership to buy a car.  I found out my credit score was pretty good considering the bankruptcy I filed 3 years ago.  My score is 687. Anyway because of the bankruptcy my finance charges were outrageous. The APR was 17.99%, that's almost $10,000 in finance charges.  Anyway the car is a 2004 Lexus fully loaded and I got a really good deal, I paid a lil over $13,000 with only 51,000 miles on it.   So my question is when would be a good time to refinance it?   Should I wait a few months to prove that I am reliable?   Can anyone recommend a reputable refinancing company?

20090309115534AA9r4Vd	Cars & Transportation;Commuting	How to get to Jarman Park (Hemel Hempstead)?	Hi all. Me and about 15 mates are planning to go to the water park at Jarman Park for someone's birthday. However, we all live in London, and don't have any idea about transport up in Hemel Hempstead!      Basically, we could get the train up, but we're a cheap lot and paying ￡11 for a return ticket each is a bit steep. Are there any buses that we could get up to the bus station from London?      And we need to get to Jarman Park of course. Are there any buses that go to Jarman Park from the bus station or the train station?      We'd be going on a Saturday if that helps anyone.      Thanks a lot!

Report found catalyst converter broken up and oxygen sensor blocked both need replacing cost of repair is just over 1500 pounds, is this reasonable.  Coil packs may also need replacing and quoted 430 pounds again is this fair? Just that a lot of money. The car is a 2004 model and apparently the warranty does not cover this????

20090309120406AARefLl	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	What is a good cheap moped I could buy?	I need to buy a moped, I'd like to get one either new or used for around 500-600 dollars to last me until August, and then I'll plan on selling it. I need it to get great gas mileage(around 100mpg), have a storage space under the seat and go atleast 30-35 mph. I'm assuming I can only get one at 50 cc for this price, I'm wondering what brands/models you'd suggest or avoid and why.
