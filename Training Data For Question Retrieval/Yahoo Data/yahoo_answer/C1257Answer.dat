Though you messed me up - I don't think its at all clear that you are pushing your brother HORIZONTALLY across the snow, with a slightly downward force. I first worked it out that he was on the downward slope and you were pushing along it. In which case he finishes up going 41.56 m/s - which is just a tad life threatening. On the other hand it is just your brother.

One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world.    These predictions are scare tactics, conspiracy theories, and chances to make money from books and movies.    Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

String theory is the closest theory to the theory of everything, but is in a sense impossible to prove or disprove. A sub theory, fastly becoming a theory of itself is Membrane theory, or M theory. People often substitute other words for M, but the original word comes from the membranes that physicists think interacted to form the big bang.

3c542e30cea696f22ee6296fcea70baeaa	Every small & cheap refractor I have ever looked through has been a disappointment. :(    I would really recommend taking the other answerer's advice and picking up a reflector.  Specifically, I would recommend a dobsonian.  A dobsonian is a special kind of reflecting telescope, a newtonian, on a special kind of telescope mount (dobsonian mount).    They are very easy to use and in my opinion are the best value of any kind of telescope out there, particularly for people just starting in astronomy.  Meade has a series called the 'LightBridge' series, which are very good and start at $500.  I would not recommend getting a scope that is smaller than 6" (diameter of the mirror), as they tend to be more like toys than real telescopes.    I'd highly recommend joining a local astronomy group and going out and looking through a few telescopes before you commit to purchase anything.  My first scope cost me $600 and it was a 4.5" Meade reflector, it was a piece of junk!!  Now I own a 10" Meade Newtonian telescope and the difference is astounding.  Its not just the size that makes the difference, the first one was a toy and the second is a real instrument.    Good luck!|`|HQPvKObxaa	I would recommend a reflecting telescope. They have much more light gathering capability that let you see fainter objects and they do not suffer from what's called chromatic aberration. Chromatic aberration is where visible light at one end of the spectrum bends at a different angle than light at the other end, causing different shades to focus at different points. This is a problem with refracting telescopes since they refract or bend light. Also, many companies try to boast magnification power, but you want the best resolving power. It will let you focus (resolve) objects at greater distances. I would suggest orion telescopes. They are very well built, even better than meade or celestrons of their same price. I just bought the skyquest dobsonian with a 4.5 inch mirror and it is awsome. No complaints. But then again, it all depends on what you want to spend. If you want a descent reflecting telescope you're looking at about $200, but it's worth the extra money instead of buying a cheaper one that will simply not suffice.|`|f1beDbKIaa	I have a TwinStar 50 mm refractor that i picked up for $20.  It's not worth it.  While the optics are OK, the mount sucks.  The sky moves with the rotation of the Earth.  And as it moves, you have to move the scope.  Fine, it has an Alt/Az head on the tripod, so move it, right?  It's easier to pick the whole thing off the ground and set it at the new angle.  Partly this is because the whole thing weighs so little, and partly it's because the head sticks, and it's to hard to get it to point anywhere in particular.  The mount could be made heavier with some weights, but so far, i've not found a solution for the head.    I chose this one because it comes with two eyepieces, 30x and 75x.  And these don't totally overpower the optics of the scope, giving grainy images, as many of this class of scope do.  If a scope boasts 575x or 675x, they clearly don't care if you ever look through it.  My Twinstar came with a 2x barlow.  There are no instructions, and most people would never guess that it won't work with the 90 degree diagonal.  So it turns the scope into a straight through 150x scope.  The optics don't support 150x - you get a grainy image.  But i'm willing to ignore the barlow.  At least it wasn't the 3x that the instructions mentioned.    I bought this TwinStar to review it.  It's the best packaged scope of this type.  My claim is that you have to be an expert to make it work.  Hardly a beginner scope.  By contrast, my $700 10 inch (254 mm) Newtonian Dob is easy to use.    The main problem with cheap scopes is the mount.  There is one type of mount under $200 that actually works.  That's the dobsonian.  There's one design of telescope that works well with the dobsonian mount.  That's the Newtonian reflector.  For $200, you can get a 4.5" (114 mm) aperture (the biggest lens or mirror) Newtonian Dob that has excellent optics, a stable mount, fits in your car (and note that i've no idea what kind of car you have), sets up quickly, and is a real performer.    http://www.telescope.com/control/product...    All that said, the Astroscan is also a good scope.  It's even easier to use.  Also $200.    http://scientificsonline.com/product.asp...    I don't believe in "beginner telescopes".  Buy what you'll use.  And you can find out what you like the most by visiting or joining a local astronomy club.    http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community...

AA10927246	First, for the others that are saying those numbers are all prime you can immediately disprove that with 111 = 3 x 37.

Then we note that 100n+11  3 (mod 4).     However, let's look at squares:  02  0 (mod 4)  12  1 (mod 4)  22  0 (mod 4)  32  1 (mod 4)  42  0 (mod 4)    Basically all the squares are congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4) and 100n + 11 is congruent to 3, so you can't have 11111... being a square.|`|AA11420751	take the  and if it is a decimal then its not perfect|`|HVJnQr3Haa	prime numbers|`|T8G0wOXQaa	A perfect square is any number times itself.

Of course, the single digit 1 is a perfect square so you are asking about numbers with more than one digit.     Suppose that there is a number z such that z^2 gives a product of all ones. Clearly, the last digit of z must be either 1 or 9 since the square of z ends in 1. Let x be all the digits of z except the last. Then z =10x+1 or 10x+9. This means that z^2 is either 100x^2 + 20x +1 or 100x^ + 20x + 81. In both cases the first term 100x^2 does not affect the last two digits of the final answer since it ends in two zeros. In the first case, note that 20x ends is zero and cannot affect the units digit. The tens digit is the last digit of 2x which is even and cannot be a 1. In the second case the tens digit is 2x+8 (the 8 is carried into the tens position from the 81). This also must be even and cannot be a 1. Since the tens digit of the product must be even, the assumption that the product produces all ones is false.

They're fine.  However...    I find that 10x binoculars are very difficult to hand hold.  You really need a decent tripod, with an adapter.  That's not a problem for me, as i have a really good $250 tripod (and worth every cent), and picked up an adapter for $8.    For hand held binoculars, i use 8x.  I have two pair.  8x21 and 8x42.  Now, everyone says you have to have tons of aperture to do astronomy.  So, you'd expect that I use the 8x42's all the time.  And, you'd be wrong.  The 8x21's fit in my pocket, so there's no reason not to have them on me.  I use them to scan the sky to find things quickly.  Once i've found something and want to look at it in detail, i have a 240x254 monocular.  You might call it a Newtonian reflector telescope.    I recommend 8x50 binoculars, generally.    And cheap binoculars, like by $25 pair are just like expensive binoculars, like my 8x42's.  Except for two things.  First, they have poor close focus.  With my 10x50's, i can focus on the wall on the opposite side of the house.  With my 8x42's, i can focus on my own knees.  Handy if you want to look for butterflies.  The other thing that expensive binoculars do is hold up to more abuse.  But eventually, they'll go the way of all good things.  But if you treat your $25 binoculars like fragile glass artwork (which is what they are), they'll last decades.  And if they break, they're only $25.

Set it up like this:    3l  3  -27  54  +  ___9__-54___        3  -18  0                      The first 3 is seperated because that's what your using to multiply with.  You would then bring down the other 3. Multiply the 3 that you just brought down with the separated 3 which equals 9. Put the 9 underneath the -27 and add them, which equals -18. Then multiply -18 with the separted 3, which equals -54. Add the 54 and -54, which equals 0.   Finally, since you have an x^3 just take the final answer to one power less. So 3x^2 -18x    *Sorry, I tried to explain to the best of my ability. hope this helps for your other problems!|`|t1XpzrBgaa	Here are the answers to 1 and 2: http://www.UploadPool.com/upload/1000000...

cKzfxE0Zaa	Antimatter actually takes more energy to make than you can get back from matter-antimatter reaction. However, if it could be safely handled, it would make the best possible form of energy storage. If there were to be some long period of energy "famine," an antimatter reserve could keep things going until circumstances got better.|`|G5nSzRJqaa	It would be a power source that could power Earth for the longest time.|`|AA11915476	possibly as an awesome powersource. depends on if we use it for good or for evil i suppose.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	Sustaining antimatter for a long time means just having it sit in a force field.  It would not do much in the way of power generation or anything else except perhaps for research.  Now if you mean containing it in a matter-antimatter reactor to generate power through mutual annihilation, that is something to be considered as a big influence on life.  But after a bit, you would have to go out and find or produce more antimatter to keep things going.
9Wi2eNInaa	Of course if you can eject your payload (the egg) I would assume you could use a parachute.     If you can't eject the egg, I might try this-- smear vasoline all over the egg and smear vasoline all over the inside surfaces of the nosecone. Put the egg into the nosecone and get a small can of Dow low expansion Great stuff polyurethane foam.    Spray the foam so it surrounds the egg and the compartment it is in . Cut off excess foam when it cures. Assemble rocket and fire off.    If you greased it up right you should be able to slide out the whole foam slug and gingerly cut the surrounding foam off the egg. The vasoline should stop the foam from bonding to the egg and the nosecone|`|SYZQZGesaa	Suspend the egg between two springs. Arrange them so that neither spring can reach maximum compression before the other spring is near maximum extension. Then place thin Styrofoam on at least two sides of the egg. The foam should still be able to move but with friction.    In this setup, you have the springs as well as the Styrofoam absorbing shock and decelerating the egg on impact while taking up very little space and adding little weight.

Control group is a group that remains untested and is compared to the one you change (the plant grown in regular light compared to the one with the UV bulb)    Independent Variable: What you control (what bulb to use, the intensity, how far you put it, how long you leave it on.)

z7BiMSWmaa	The cell cycle is divided into two main parts: interphase and mitosis. During interphase, the cell grows and replicates its chromosomes. Interphase accounts for all but an hour or two of a 24-h cell cycle, and is subdivided into three phases: gap phase 1 (G1), synthesis (S), and gap phase 2 (G2). Interphase is followed by mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cell division).|`|aiYPHUEWaa	ok - the answer is above, but here is a way to remember the steps in order next time:  In Persia Mighty Alexander Tread  (Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telaphase)  Interphase technically isn't a step, since it is actually the state during which there is no mitosis|`|vmu2LlzMaa	Interphase  Prophase  Metaphase  Anaphase  Telophase|`|1CmukOQDaa	Just to add on a little bit of info, the cell cycle doesn't necessarily take 24 hours.

Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase. (PMAT) For Meiosis, it i Prophase 1, Metaphase 1, Anaphase 1, Telophase 1, then Prophase 2, Metaphase 2, Anaphase 2, and Telophase 2. Interphase comes only before the first cycle of Meiosis.|`|VQ3pW3sWaa	The entire cell cycle is divided into interphase and mitosis.  The Cell Cycle is G1, S, G2, M (mitosis).    Interphase is a period of growth and development. It is the longest phase in the cell cycle.    Interphase is divided into 3 sub-phases: G1, S and G2.     G1 is the first period of growth in interphase.    After G1 there is a restriction point. If the cell does not receives the go ahead signal at the restriction point, it will enter G zero. In G zero, the cell does not divide. Nerve cells and some muscle cells are in G zero phase.    If the cell does receive a signal, it will enter S phase.    S phase- Stands for synthesis. The second DNA molecule (chromatid) is replicated from each chromosome.    G2- is a phase where the cell prepares for mitosis or M phase.    After G2, mitosis starts. Mitosis consists of four phases: prophase, metaphase (middle), anaphase (apart) and telophase (two).    Cytokinesis is the divding of the cytoplasm between cells and it begins during telophase.

vmu2LlzMaa	The lytic cycle is the path of a virulent virus, in that it enters the cell, uses the cell's machinery to reproduce itself, repackages inside the cell, the bursts out, killing the cell and moving on to nearby cells.    The lysogenic cycle is the path of a temperate virus, in that it enters the cell and integrates its genetic material into that of the host. So it gets replicated with the host DNA and "lives" with the host. It can stay in this cycle indefinitely and then enter the lytic cycle by getting cut out of the host DNA and going through the motions stated above.

R7kk39sTaa	Doubling the concentration of B (trial 2 vs. trial 1) doubles the rate.   R = k [B]^n  2R = k [2B]^n  n must be 1 (lst order)    Doubling the concentration of A (trial 3 vs. trial 1) quadruples the rate.  R = k [A]^m  4R = k [2A]^m m must be 2 (2nd order)    R = k [A]^2 [B]^1|`|eZyNJdxQaa	In order to find the order of reaction for A and B, you need to use this equation:    (Rate 2/Rate 1)= (k*Concentration A2^p * Concentration B2^q)/(k*Concentration A1^p*Concentration B1^q)   The k's will cancel and the concentrations that are the same will also cancel. And you should end up with something like this:  (*For the Order of B in the reaction)  (2.4*10^4)/(1.2*10^4)=(0.020 M)^q/(0.10M)^q  which is: 2=2^q   now take the natural log of both sides  ln 2 = q*ln 2 then solve for q  q = 1  Follow the same process in order to find the Rate of A in the reaction by using Trial 1 and 3 .  The key is to find the concentration that is the same in both trials and solve for the unknown p and q variables.|`|b436010cfb329ff03ed7394926ab543daa	If you double the concentration of B without changing the concentration of A, the rate doubles, so the rate is proportional to B. If you double A without changing B, the rate changes by a factor of 4, so the rate is proportional to A2. Therefore, the rate law is r = k[A]2[B].
9lzNDwhZaa	Zonal fossils. Each geological period from the Cambrian onwards has characteristic fossils. Generally each period is subdivided and each subdivision also has characteristic fossils.    Two outcrops of a particular age a considerable distance apart, can be correlated on the basis of having common fossils.    In the Precambrian, things are far more subjective. Subdivisions of the Proterozoic, which are largely composed of sediments or metamorphosed sediments, are judged on a sedimentological basis which can be open to error.    Where an igneous rock intrudes a sediment of a particular age, it is known to be younger than that sediment. Where an igneous body has sedimentary rocks unconformably laid over it, the igneous body can be considered older than these sedimentary rocks. Where fossils occur within these neighbouring sedimentary rocks, they can, by indirect means, determine where the igneous rocks belong in terms of the geological time scale.|`|Qr0UfKOuaa	idk

The molar mass of C3H8 is 44.0 g/mol.  100. g C3H8 x (1 mol / 44.0 g) = 2.27 mol C3H8    2.27 mol C3H8 x (5 mol O2 / 1 mol C3H8) = 11.4 mol O2  11.4 mol O2 x (32.0 g / 1 mol) = 386 g O2 (3 sig. figs.)    1 mol O2 occupies 22.4 L at STP  11.4 mol O2 x (22.4 L / 1 mol) = 255 L of pure O2    Air x 0.21 = 255 L  Air = 255 L / 0.21 = 1200 L of air (2 sig. figs.)    1 mol C3H8 produces 3 mol CO2  2.27 mol C3H8 x (3 mol CO2 / 1 mol C3H8) = 6.81 mol CO2  6.81 mol CO2 x (22.4 L / 1 mol ) = 153 L CO2 at STP|`|KJHw0oI3aa	C3H8 + 5 O2 ---> 3 CO2 + 4 H2O    The coefficients in the equation provide the ratio by moles of reactants and products.  The coefficient in front of C3H8 is understood to be 1, and the coefficient in front of O2 is 5.  Therefore, 5 moles of oxygen are required to burn 1 mole of propane.    To find the grams of oxygen required to burn 100. grams of propane, use dimensional analysis to convert 100. g of propane to moles of propane, to moles of oxygen, to grams of oxygen as follows:    [(100. g C3H8)/1][(1 mol C3H8)/(44.097 g C3H8)][(5 mol O2)/(1 mol C3H8)][(31.998 g O2)/(1 mol O2)] = 363 g of O2    To calculate the volume of oxygen needed to burn 100. g of propane, we can use dimensional analysis to convert 100. g of propane to moles of propane, to moles of oxygen, to liters of oxygen as follows:    [(100. g C3H8)/1][(1 mol C3H8)/(44.097 g C3H8)][(5 mol O2)/(1 mol C3H8)][(22.4 L O2)/(1 mol O2)] = 254 L of O2 at STP    Since air is only about 21% oxygen, we can convert Liters of oxygen to liters of air by multiplying them by 100 and dividing them by 21:    254 L x 100 / 21 = 1,210. L of air required to burn 100 g of propane    To find the volume of CO2 produced when 100. g of propane is burned, use dimensional analysis to convert 100. g of propane to moles of propane, to moles of CO2, to Liters of CO2 as follows:    [(100. g C3H8)/1][(1 mol C3H8)/(44.097 g C3H8)][(3 mol CO2)/(1 mol C3H8)][(22.4 L CO2)/(1 mol CO2)] = 152 L of CO2 at STP would be produced when 100. g of propane is burned|`|S7S3jKGSaa	Go to allmsu.com under the CE280 thread, tell everyone you know about it and hopefully we can get enough people helping with these problems

AA11824362	You really should be asking this question in Astronomy but here goes my answer. Parallax is the apparent shift in a stars position when viewed at opposite times of the year (like April 30 and October 30). The shift is very small, and gets smaller and smaller further away from Earth. Therefore, only stars that are relatively close to Earth will have enough of a shift to observe.|`|7zq118YXaa	Try the Astronomy section, but i know a little about it.      Parallax is only good for the close stars because when the earth is at its farthest distance for the parallax picture, the parallax of the star is less than .008     Any farther than Proxima Centauri (the closest star to the earth (besides the sun)) just wouldn't be possible.

In this case, f = 0.15 / 8.00 = 0.1875, or 1/f = 5.333...  Substituting,  N = log(base 2) (5.333) = 2.415 half lives. Since each half life is 30 min, then  (2.415 half lives) (30.0 min / half life) = 72.45 minutes.

DNpgwie2aa	Because we are in orbit..  The suns gravity is pulling us in, our motion around the sun forces us out.  These 2 forces are balanced to keep us in our orbit.  So we are in perpetual freefall around the sun.  If a stray large object like a jupiter went through our solar system, it could potentially disrupt our orbit and send us out or into the sun.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Because of two laws of nature.  1. The conservation of energy.  2. The conservation of angular momentum.    The conservation of energy ensures that the sum of Earth's kinetic energy and potential energy, U + K, relative to the sun, will never change. If Earth suddenly took off for interstellar space, or suddenly halted in its orbit, that law would be violated.    The conservation of angular momentum ensures that Earth will continue to follow its regular orbital motion and won't take any unexpected sharp turns. It does that by keeping the vector quantity R x MV constant, where R is the position (vector) of Earth relative to the sun, M is Earth's mass (scalar), and V is Earth's velocity (vector). The "x" denotes "cross multiplication," which is a way of multiplying two vectors to get a third vector that is perpendicular to them.    For example, if the Earth suddenly stopped moving at a tangent to its orbit and took a dive straight into the sun, the conservation of energy might not be violated (if the plunge speed were the same as the orbit speed had been), but the conservation of angular momentum surely would be violated.    So the two laws together make sure that Earth stays in its orbit.|`|uFJYZZrTaa	This is actually a kind of a complicated physics problem.  The Earth without the sun would fly into space in a straight line because an object in motion will travel in a straight line at a constant velocity until on outside force acts upon it.  The gravity of the sun disrupts the travel of the Earth and causes it to move in basically an oval around the sun.  The force of gravity is not strong enough to pull the Earth into the sun only keep it where it is.  There is a lot of math that you can do to prove this that I don't feel like typing out but that is the basic jist of it.|`|iCNC6Lnbaa	I could be wrong, but I believe that the gravity from the sun keeps up in orbit around the sun itself.|`|ZaYyXiJAaa	Everything has a gravitational orbit, even you and me. The reason we do not notice is because the earth's is overpowering ours, because of it's immense size. Therefore, gravitational strength comes from the size of an object. Since the Sun is hundreds of thousands times bigger than the earth, it holds it tightly in it's orbit, just like all of the other planets and astroid belt.|`|AA10164889	The earth orbits around the sun at a more or less fixed distance according  to universal laws of orbital motion.  It will continue to do so for many billions of years to come, so there is nothing to worry about.    In brief, the motion of the earth along its orbit creates centrifugal force, which tends to pull the earth away from the sun, and at the same time, the gravitational mass of the sun pulls the earth toward the sun.  The shape of the earth's orbit around the sun is the result of the aeternal balance of these two forces.    It's been this way for a long time, and it's not something to lose sleep over.

If solutions of Ni(NO3)2 and KCl are mixed, the equation for this reaction is the following:    Ni(NO3)2(aq) + KCl(aq) --> KNO3(aq) + NiCl3(aq)    Since both potential products are "soluble", there is no precipitate, and no evidence of a chemical reaction.  The solution remain clear, though not necessarily colorless.    The product of a precipitation reaction is always a "solid".

Don't know if this is right ,but this is what i'm coming up with.  Anyone out there agrees or has a different answer?????

9Wi2eNInaa	You have to know the pressure of your system  Say you have a 2000 psi pump.    Then you take the area of your hydraulic cylinder. For example if you have a 3" diameter hydraulic cylinder the area of that surface is     A= pi * R^2    that is area equals pi times radius squared    A= 3.14 x  1.5 inches squared = 7.07 square inches of area on 3" cylinder    if you have 2000 psi then that 2000 psi pushes on all that 7.07 square inches of surface area equally so    2000 psi  x  7.07 square inches = 14,140 lbs of pressure    So this cylinder can lift 14,140 lbs or a little over 7 tons    The formula is Circle Area of cylinder x hydraulic pump pressure = hydraulic lift in lbs|`|SYZQZGesaa	Size isn't really the major factor. What you need to consider is the pressure in terms of pounds per square inch. For instance, if you need 100 lbs of pressure and you have a 10 lb pump or pressure source, then 10psi x 10 square inches = 100 psi. You can find a VERY large selection of hydraulic cylinders for different pressures, in different sizes and for different actions.|`|DYvJb6Ivaa	You probably know the force you need to produce and the pressure from the source supplying the hydraulic cylinder.  So to calculate the size (area) of the hydraulic cylinder you need, use this equation  -->  F / P = A   where F is the force you need to produce, P is the supply pressure to the hydraulic cylinder, and A is the surface area of the cylinder head.

CCeRdaoLaa	The gills have a huge number of capillaries close to the surface to allow oxygen transfer from the water into the bloodstream.    Fish blood uses hemoglobin to transport oxygen just like humans, and hemoglobin turns bright red when oxygenated and dark red when deoxygenated (but never blue, contrary to the popular myth).  So then, why are the fish's gills dark red in a location where the blood should be freshly oxygenated?    The gills are dark red because of counter-current flow.  Water flows through the mouth and over the gills in a head-to-tail direction.  The blood flows opposite, in a tail-to-head direction.  The reason lies with hemoglobin's oxygen-binding ability, or its O2 affinity.  Hemoglobin can bind 4 O2 molecules at once.  It binds the first O2 very easily, but each one after that gets a little harder.  The 4th O2 is the hardest of all.      With counter-current flow, the water at the front of the gills has the most O2, and as it passes further through the gills, more O2 is taken out.  Since the blood flows in the opposite direction, that means that when the fresh blood first enters the gills, the water has little O2 in it... but that's OK, since hemoglobin has a high affinity for the first O2 and can easily pull it out of the water.  By the time the blood reaches the front part of the gills, it already has 3 O2 molecules bound to it, and will have a tough time picking up a 4th... but that's still OK, because the water in that part of the gills is fresh and has a lot of O2 in it, making it easy for the hemoglobin to pick up that tough, last O2.    If you were to look deep within the gills of a fish, you'd see brighter oxygenated blood up near the front, and darker, less oxygenated blood near the back.  You just don't normally see it, since the deeper parts of the gills are hidden under the gill flaps.|`|HRI8BhS6aa	since fishes don't breath AIR like humans, they have to EXCHANGE oxygen somewhere...and since the skin/scales don't exchange/breath air, this is the organ left.....      also, look up ram-venhilation.....its kinda neat to know|`|1LqqDwIvaa	The gills are oxygenated.|`|b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Because the gills are very heavily vascularized - that it, there's lots of blood vessels in them.    Gills are how a fish breathes.  There is not very much oxygen in water, so gills have to be very efficient at taking oxygen from the water and passing it into the blood so it can get to the cells that need it (and to take the carbon dioxide from the blood and passing it to the water).  In order to do this, it has lots and lots of blood vessels.  Also, the blood vessels are organized in special ways - called counter current exchange mechanism - so exchange between the blood and the sea water occurs constantly during the time the blood is in the gills.

It was his theory that an adult human can process up to one pint per day of sea water, no more, without damage.    He thought that people set adrift fought the urge to drink sea water until they couldn't stand it anymore, then drank too much as a resut, and died because of the overdose. On his trip he supplemented sea water with fish juices, which are less saline, and rain water.    He taught that one should start the pint per day regimen right at the outset in order not to get too thirsty. That he survived would seem to indicate there is some merit to his idea, but survival training now teaches strict abstinence.    Salt is not a poison.

31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    6x^2 - 13x - 5 =     (2x - 5)(3x + 1)     Here are rules for factoring trinomials.    On every type of factoring problem ALWAYS look first for a GCF, a greatest common factor. There won't always be one, but if there is, you should divide it out first. A GCF will carry along through the problem and be the first thing in an answer with a GCF.    I' m going to explain factoring trinomials the way that I teach it, which is probably different from what you've done. Try to follow the steps. This method will work on any trinomial.    6x2 - 13x - 5 Look for a GCF None this time. If there was one, factor it out. Then temporarily start both parentheses with the first number and variable.   (6x.......)(6x..........) First sign goes in first parentheses.  (6x..-....)(6x..........) Product of signs goes in 2nd parentheses.  (6x..-....)(6x...+.....)     Now multiply your first and third numbers together. Ignore their signs - you've already done them. 6 x 5 = 30 So, out to the side list pairs of factors of 30.     30  ------  1, 30  2, 15  3, 10  5, 6    Now you want to pick which factors go in your parentheses, using these rules:    If the signs you put on your parentheses are the SAME, find the factors that ADD up to the middle number in the problem.   If the signs you put on your parentheses are the DIFFERENT, find the factors that SUBTRACT to the middle number in the problem. (Note you look at signs in the parentheses, not in the problem.)    (6x..-....)(6x...+.....) Your signs are different, so you want to subtract factors to get 13. Those factors are 2 and 15.   (Notice that 3 and 10 would have added to 13, so you HAD to know to subtract this time.) When you put the numbers in the parentheses, the bigger number is pushy - it always goes first. So your factors now are:  (6x.-.15)(6x.+.2.)    Now you have to reduce either or both parentheses by dividing each parentheses' terms by the largest possible divisor. In our problem, the first parentheses is divisible by 3 and the second parentheses is divisible by 2.    (6x.-.15)(6x.+.2)  ----------- ---------   . . 3 . . . . . . 2  This reduces to your final factors of    (2x - 5)(3x + 1)     Here's another problem!    3y2 - 13y - 10 Look for a GCF None this time. If there was one, factor it out. Then temporarily start both parentheses with the first number and variable.   (3y.......)(3y..........) First sign goes in first parentheses.  (3y..-....)(3y..........) Product of signs goes in 2nd parentheses.  (3y..-....)(3y...+.....)     Now multiply your first and third numbers together. Ignore their signs - you've already done them. 3 x 10 = 30 So, out to the side list pairs of factors of 30.     30  ------  1, 30  2, 15  3, 10  5, 6    Now you want to pick which factors go in your parentheses, using these rules:    If the signs you put on your parentheses are the SAME, find the factors that ADD up to the middle number in the problem.   If the signs you put on your parentheses are the DIFFERENT, find the factors that SUBTRACT to the middle number in the problem. (Note you look at signs in the parentheses, not in the problem.)    (3y..-....)(3y...+.....) Your signs are different, so you want to subtract factors to get 13. Those factors are 2 and 15. ( Notice that 3 and 10 would have added to 13, so you HAD to know to subtract this time.) When you put the numbers in the parentheses, the bigger number is pushy - it always goes first. So your factors now are:  (3y..-..15)(3y.+.2.)    Now you have to reduce either or both parentheses by dividing each parentheses' terms by the largest possible divisor. In our problem, the first parentheses is divisible by 3 but the second parentheses does not reduce.    (3y..-..15)(3y.+.2.)  -------------  .......3 This reduces to your final factors of    (y - 5)(3y + 2)    NEXT PROBLEM !!    2x2 +15x + 7 Look for a GCF None this time. If there was one, factor it out. Then temporarily start both parentheses   ............................. with the first number and variable.   (2x.......)(2x..........) First sign goes in first parentheses.  (2x..+....)(2x..........) Product of signs goes in 2nd parentheses.  (2x..+....)(2x...+.....)     Now multiply your first and third numbers together. Ignore their signs - you've already done them. 2 x 7 = 14 So, out to the side list pairs of factors of 14.     14  ------  1, 14  2, 7    Now you want to pick which factors go in your parentheses, using these rules:    If the signs you put on your parentheses are the SAME, find the factors that ADD up to the middle number in the problem.   If the signs you put on your parentheses are the DIFFERENT, find the factors that SUBTRACT to the middle number in the problem. (Note you look at signs in the parentheses, not in the problem.)    (2x..+....)(2x...+.....) Your signs are the same, so you want to add factors to get 15. Those factors are 1 and 14. When you put the numbers in the parentheses, the bigger number is pushy - it always goes first. So your factors now are:  (2x.+.14)(2x.+.1)    Now you have to reduce either or both parentheses by dividing each parentheses' terms by the largest possible divisor. In our problem, the first parentheses is divisible by 2 but the second parentheses does not reduce.

SvmZlLdaaa	First of all, I would like to point out that white tigers are not a different species or subspecies - they are just Bengal tigers with a genetic condition called leucism, which results in reduced pigmentation. This is not the same as albinism, which is a complete lack of pigment - an albino tiger would have no stripes, and pink eyes, not blue.    White tigers can and do occur in the wild, but are rare for two reasons. First, leucism is caused by recessive genes, meaning that two individuals carrying the gene must mate, and both must pass on the gene to the offspring in order for that offspring to be leucistic (if only one parent passes on the leucistic gene, the offspring will be normally coloured, since the gene for normal colour is dominant over the leucistic gene). Second, being white is something of a disadvantage for a tiger. It lacks the natural camouflage of normally coloured individuals, and most of those born will be killed by predators whilst young and vulnerable, since they stand out. Those that do survive to adulthood will have a hard time hunting for the same reason - it will be easier for their prey to see them coming.    Tigers as a species are endangered due to humans - threats to the species include habitat destruction, depletion of their prey species, and hunting for various reasons (e.g. out of fear of them killing people or livestock, for their skins, and for their body-parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine). Since white tigers are naturally rarer than normally coloured ones, the more endangered tigers become the less chance there is of any leucistic individuals occurring and surviving.    However, white tigers are common in captivity as they are a draw for zoos and wildlife parks. Unfortunately, this has led to some unscrupulous breeding in the past, and many captive individuals are now inbred and suffer the detrimental effects.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	They are a human creation.|`|4JkdxfjJaa	Yes. White Bengal tigers are endangered, because they are tigers. And they are not a separate species as you maybe suggesting. They are just Bengal tigers with a mutated gene that makes them white. All tigers species are considered endangered. Poaching and habitat loss are the main threats the tigers have and could become extinct.|`|TdeBI8Nuaa	Yes white Bengal tigers are the most endangered because there are no known white tigers in the wild. Both parent tigers have to have the white tiger gene to make a white tiger and that doesn't always happen. White tigers are only found now in zoo's because they look for the gene, then find a female with that gene and breed them. Most white tigers in zoos have the same father or mother.

There is a belt of many of them between Mars and Jupiter.  Jupiter may have prevented a planet from forming out of the belt.  They range in size from several hundred miles in diameter to grains of sand and smaller dust particles.  The first one was discovered in 1801.  Many moons of planets are captured asteroids.  Mars has two, Jupiter and Saturn have many.  The Earth has a very small one far out towards the Sun, in a looping orbit that is always quite a distance beyond the moon.  Scars on the moon and earth came from asteroid or comet collisions.  Searches for NEOs, or Near Earth Objects is underway to identify any threats  The Torino scale is a chart to assess the level of a threat.  So far, the highest threat is T2 out of 10.  The asteroid Apophis will pass closer than some geosynchronous satellites (clower than 22,300 miles) on Friday, April 13,2029.  It will miss the earth, but not by much.  If it passes within a very small spot called a "keyhole" in space, it will return in 2036 and perhaps hit somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.  But that is a faint possibility.|`|WESfYeUTaa	well, if your rich9 and i mean stinkin' rich u can take a launch to outer space and go all the way to alpha centauir
yaJ2481maa	I liquid you can pick up as long as it's in a container. A solid is the only type of object that you can physically hold because of it's structure. liquids and gasses are not as closely compacted and transform based on their containers, and that's why they aren't able to be held...they're not solids!|`|uFJYZZrTaa	You cannot "pick up" a liquid or gas like a solid because of the way their molecules are set up.  In a solid the molecules are incredibly close so they hold together and do not move so you can hold them.  In a liquid or gas the molecules are far apart and always moving so it is impossible to get them to "stick together" and stay in one place.|`|wfhZ5JuEaa	The molecules in pieces of matter interact through either chemical bonding or secondary forces (like hydrogen bonding, vander waals forces, electrostatic attraction/repulsion).    In the case of solids like metals or ceramics, the atoms link up into a large network of chemical bonds.  More complexly mixed solids, such as wood, or plastics, are 'connected' by a combination of chemical bonding and secondary forces.    The important thing is that chemical bonds are stronger than secondary forces.  And a solid has more direct bonds, and so the molecules or atoms within it associate stronger.    In the case of liquids, they are attracted only by secondary forces.  For example, water has particularly strong secondary forces in the form of 'hydrogen bonding', which is why it is a liquid even though it is such a small simple molecule.  But these secondary forces can still be easily broken, which is why liquids can evaporate, and why when you swish your hand through water, it moves out of the way.    Gases are even worse, their molecules don't attract one another significantly, so they go zooming off in whatever direction they can, at the whims of their container (like a balloon, or a room) and whatever air currents they can find (think wind).    The reason you can't pick up gases or liquids is because the associations between molecules you touch aren't strong enough to transmit the force your hand exerts upon them to the molecules around them without dissociating.    Imagine dragging a spoon through a bowl of cheerios, and all the cheerios move out of the way.  If those cheerios were somehow attached, they could transmit that force and move in a big clump, but instead they just get swept aside.    Now imagine dragging a spoon through a bowl of really sticky rice... all that rice is strongly associated with other rice, so it doesn't flow around the spoon as nicely.  You can even pick up sticky rice with chopsticks... try doing that with a clump of cheerios...

SkFgDxpEaa	i think gary H has got the right answer but truelly idk|`|UAYzLyN4aa	Gary H and Chris M have this. I will add my two cents.     The "bitter cold of outer space" is a tired old cliche.     In fact, temperature is a property of matter. Where there is no matter, there is no heat, nor cold. Space is not quite completely devoid of matter but the density is so low (I think the average is about one hydrogen molecule per cubic meter) that it might as well be.     Hence "space" is neither hot nor cold. Like the vacuum in a vacuum bottle, it merely insulates.     Things IN space get hot, or cold, depending on whether they're near a radiating heat source, whether or not they have an internal heat source, and how well they absorb and/or radiate heat. With an insulating vacuum all around the only way an object can either pick up heat or lose it is through radiation.    Apollo 13 got cold ony because all the electronics were shut down to save power. The spacecraft was designed to achieve a comfortable equilibrium temperature but only with the equipment running.     Another point about Apollo 13: You might have noticed in the movie... I think it was shortly before Swiggert got the request to flip the cryo stir switch... a line about "barbecue roll." This (like most of the in-mission dialogue in the film) was accurate terminology: it refers to the spacecraft "rolling" slowly on its long axis as it travels between earth and moon, so that heat picked up by a side facing the sun could then be radiated away when that side was facing away from the sun.     Similarly, the Shuttle often orbits with its cargo doors open and facing the Earth - this is for heat management.     Heat management is a considerable problem for spacecraft and despite the cliche about "bitter cold" the problem is not always how to stay warm. Sometimes the problem is how to stay cool when there's no good way to dump the heat and you're in sunlight far stronger than we get on Earth.    0 kelvin, absolute zero, is -460 degrees F, -273 degrees C. Google calculator will do this and many other conversions for you. Just type "0 kelvin in degrees C" into Google search, for example.|`|G5nSzRJqaa	Depends were in the Universe. Near the sun hot. Where Apollo 13 is (the moon) it is around -273 degrees Fahrenheit at night time. Where Voyager 1 and 2 is (Past Neptune but before the Oort Cloud) is somewhere around 50 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero.|`|HQPvKObxaa	It all depends on where you are in space. Absolute zero is 0 on the Kelvin scale which is where not even electrons can move. The spaces between the galaxies can be as cold as 10 degrees K. 373 on the K scale is the boiling point for water and 273 is the freezing point of water.|`|9Wt6MjVPaa	but why would it be cold? you got the sun's heat.    Maybe no atmosphere? I've never been to space :)|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	The interstellar medium varies from 6 degrees Kelvin to millions of degrees.  But the density is low, so the heat content per volume is also low.|`|HTmj2BXDaa	There is no air to insulate or to absorb some of the sun's energy so, in the sunshine, it gets very hot very quickly and, in the shade, it gets very cold very quickly.  How hot depends on the characteristics of the surface.  You might notice that lots of satellites are white or polished shiny metal.  This is so most of the sun's energy bounces off and does not heat the surface so much.  It is also true that things that do not absorb radiant energy very well don't give up radiant energy very well.  So surfaces that are good at keeping things from getting too hot are also good at not losing heat so fast.  In the shade, there is nothing but the darkness of space to radiate any heat back towards the surface.  Without any other source of heat, even a surface that radiates heat slowly will cool off.  It will continue to cool off until the heat that it gives up is balanced by the heat that it absorbs.  In space, there is very very little heat coming from anything other than the sun so the shady side will cool down to hundreds of degrees below zero.  You may have also noticed that most satellites rotate all the time.  That is to even out the sunny and shady sides.  hope this helps|`|391ab9ab9f7cc97eb35fe06a5632d5f2aa	At 5000 light years from earth there is a formation known as the boomerang nebula which at the time 2003 was the coldest place outside a Laboratory 215.15C or 1K|`|X23dsndMaa	Very cold.  Space cannot generate heat enough to warm space even with the sun because the particles that dominates the space is too small to be exited to produce heat as compared to particles in the earth atmosphere.  without the presence of gravity the molecules in space will be too far to collide to excite and produce significant heat vital to human survival.
AA11148143	It can be directed like a gun. A rocket works on Newton's Third Law, which says there are always two forces, equal and opposite. So the rocket expels gas one way, that pushes the ship the opposite direction.    It does not push on surrounding air; in fact, it works better in a vacuum because there is less resistance.    BTW, the octopus figured this out long before Newton did.    But of course the octopus doesn't  call it a 'reaction engine.'

The reality is we will probably never get to meet them due to relativity. What reason do they have to come to our planet and don't say exploration. They would not want to do so due to the fact that it takes years to reach another place in the universe where by the time you get there things would have changed and this goes for the journey home, where by the time they return home it might have been destroyed or changed into something new or different. So unless these Aliens are willing to leave there civilizations behind forever we will never know or see other lifeforms, but this doesn't mean they don't exist it just means we have a lot of waiting, growing and traveling to do.

SEA8CAHnaa	I believe you're asking about albedo, not aldebo. Albedo is a measurement of the amount of light, or radiation, reflected from the sun. Thus, 0% is NO radiation reflected (thus all absorbed; black in color) and 100% is ALL radiation reflected (thus none absorbed; white in color).  An albedo of 60% means:    (A)- 60% radiation energy is reflected.    You might think- "Hey, doesn't that also mean that 40% is asorbed?"   Well, yes, but because albedo is ONLY a measurement of "reflectivity," or how much energy is reflected, absorbtion is not taken into account, even though it is implied.    Hope this helps!|`|CYtMRC4eaa	Yes, the best answer is (a).|`|b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	a. 60% of the radiation is reflected    "aldebo:  A measure of the reflecting power of a non-luminous surface, defined as the amount of radiation reflected in all direction to total it receives.

XGw7pu4Raa	d - Chance is involved in all scientific discoveries.    Chance or random events are part of the scientific process but that does not mean that science is chaotic or random.  The scientific process involves observing a phenomenon, making a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon, creating an experiment or situation that allows you to repeat the conditions that you first observed this event to test your hypothetical explanation, and then use the new data gathered from your experiment (or further observations) to refine your hypothesis.  In the experimental/observational step chance plays a large part in what you find.  Using statistics and multiple observations the scientist can state how likely an event represents what normally happens when a random sample of observations is taken under the experimental conditions.    Naturally some observations can not be repeated because the event happens only once or extremely rarely.  In cases like this (for example cosmic events like a supernova) it is important to have multiple measurements of the same event using different instruments or from different groups of scientists.  This allows you to compare individual results to refine your explanations.  Chance still plays a role here.  Each instrument or observer will 'see' the event from a unique perspective and so by chance may get better or worse data.|`|da23xy1Baa	either a or d.

KHjYq2bHaa	The Moon and the Earth orbit around their barycentre, which is in fact inside the Earth. The barycentre is a point where it is the system's center of mass. Humans have set foot on both The Earth and Moon, the only 2 celestial bodies that have been set foot.    The Sun and Moon both effect Earth through tides. Their gravitational attraction somewhat lifts water levels to create tides on our shores. Numerous amounts of calendars are due to the motions of the Sun and Moon. A year is the time taken to go around the sun. A month is roughly the time for the Moon to go around the Earth. A week is roughly the time between moon phases. Both the Sun and Moon are involved in solar and lunar eclipses depending on their alignment.    I'm sure there are a lot of other similarities, I just can't think of more at this moment.

XrKLAhfiaa	I can get you started, and see if that helps you figure out the rest...    A) y = f(x) + 2  Look at your picture of f(x), and imagine that the lines making up the graph are solid, so that you can pick it up and move it.  So your equation says that you are going to pick up f(x) and move it up 2.  In other words, every point on your existing graph is going to move up 2 points in the y-direction.      B) y = f(x+ 2)  This is along the same lines as the previous one, but instead of moving up/down in the y-direction, we are moving in the x-direction.  However, it's not what you think - it looks like you should be moving over 2 in the positive direction, but what you're actually going to do is move your whole graph over 2 to the left (negative direction).    C) y = g(x-3)  This is opposite of what we did above.  We are going to pick our graph up (g(x) this time) and move it 3 to the right (positive direction).    D) y = g(x) - 3  This is similar to the first one.  We are going to pick up g(x) and move it down 3 in the y-direction.    E) y = -f(x)  Now imagine that you can spin your graph around the x-axis.  Give it one flip, and just turn it completely over.  Whever your positive values were for y, they will now become negative.  And whatever negative values of y you had will now be positive.    F y = 0.5g(x)  I'm going to leave this one up to you - look at the examples in your book, and look back over our others and see if you can figure it out. :)|`|xllv03V8aa	f(x) is saying that f is a function of x. so f is dependent on x. imagine i say f(x) = 2+x . if i tell u x= 5, then what is f(x) then u say 7 right? how about if x=4? then f(x) is 6. so u see? f(x) is dependent on the value of x.     so , as u said u have two graphs in front of u. i believe two lines. A says that u have to move the line (f(x)) up by 2. so if the points are at (-2,-1), (2,-1) u add 2 to y values so they become (-2, 1) and (2,1) so the line gets shifted up by 2. B) x values get shifted to left by 2 (for x if it is x+2 u go left 2 . if it is x-2 u go right 2)  C) u go right 3 values D)down 3 values. E) multiply ur  y values by -1. and so on. it is basically shifiting of ur graphs

There are a few forms of time travel, but which one is the right one? There is the time travel where you can go back and forth through time and there's the type which manipulates the flow of time so that we can travel great distances without feeling the effects of time (sort of like Star Trek warp tech.)     Concerning the back and forth time travel the belief is that if you were to do so you could either change time thereby creating a paradox where events turned our different in the future and then there's the type where your going back was the reason certain events in time happened to begin with.     In my belief, time travel is possible but only for observation of events, to change event is impossible. The reason why is this, if you were to go back in time so you could eliminate your younger self, that would be impossible because it would be a contradiction of time for you would not have been able to go back in the first place so that you could attempt to assassinate yourself. This lead to reason that no events can ever be changed since we are the way we are due to events happening. The best example would be The Terminator Movie. John Connor owes his existence to the fact that the war happened for if it didn't then he would not have existed to send back his father to impregnate his mother thus birthing himself to do the same thing for the sake of mankind.    In essence time travel could be possible but only for the act of learning not manipulation, at least I believe. The only other reason could be survival by escaping an apocalypse in the future by going back to a point of peace.

9Wi2eNInaa	Table salt will not replace potassium nitrate. Potassium nitrate is an oxidizer which means it supplies oxygen to the combustion process to keep it going in a closed container with no access to air.    Table salt is just sodium chloride and has no oxygen in it.    Don't listen to all these super safety nuts out there. I was a lot like you, sometimes it is just fun to experiment with things that might go boom, but when you start out just use a little common sense and start out with small quantities.    The formula you spoke of you can replace the potassium nitrate with sodium nitrate which should be easier to find. Sodium nitrate is sold in small 5 lb bags as nitrogen fertilizer in most well stocked garden centers.    But to tell you the truth, when I was a kid I think I tried to make the recipe you are using with sugar and potassium nitrate (and back 40 years ago when I was a kid you could buy pretty much anything you wanted off the shelf) and I think all it did was fizzle and make a bright yellow white flame for a while (you actually need a percussion cap to make it work right, and no kid and most adults have access to these now a days.     So I think you would be disappointed with that formula you found on the internet.    And you have to understand a little basic chemistry too.    To make rocket fuel you need a fuel and a oxidizer. If you don't have both you won't have rocket fuel. Sugar is a fuel, it has carbons and hydrogens and can be burned. But without mixing it with an oxygen source that fuel will not give up it's energy. So when you asked if you can use table salt for a fuel, it shows you don't  understand the difference between a fuel and an oxidizer.     So to find your rocket fuel let me say it is easy finding a fuel...like gasoline, alcohol, powdered flour or sugar, corn syrup, kerosene,  etc.  The hard part is finding that oxidizer, like sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, liquid oxygen,fluorine, swimming pool chlorine etc.    But even if you mix them together, you need the right proportions and the right particle structure.    I made black powder as a kid and all it did was fizzle. I bought black powder for a muzzle loader and it burned beautifully with a big puff and instantly.  The difference was, the manufacturer knew you had to "prill the ingredients , which was to mix them intimately and shape the particles to burn very efficiently.    Without learning a little chemistry first, chances are you won't get very far. Good luck!|`|UfNG9umXaa	You should really reconsider trying to make rocket fuel. You do not know enough about chemistry to undertake an endeavor such as making rocket fuel. I know this because you ask if sodium chloride would work. There are too many "Kids" like you who are missing fingers and/or eyes. Leave it alone for a few years.....and take a few chem classes.

So most geologists postulate that there must be a hot-spot too.    The answer is: The spreading ridge between the North American and Eurasian plates, with a dollop of hot-spot volcanism.

IUmAflSqaa	I think you may be talking about the multiplicative inverse.  If not, then the answer above this is the correct one.    So for 23 to have an inverse mod 41, it must be relatively prime to 41.  This is true, since 41 and 23 are distinct primes.  Now we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers r, s such that r*23+s*41 = 1, which you can always do for two relatively prime numbers.    41 = 23 + 18  23 = 18 + 5  18 = 3*5 + 3  5 = 3 + 2  3 = 2 + 1    So:    1 = 3-2 =  3-(5-3) = 2*3-5 =  2(18-3*5)-5 = 2*18-7*5 =  2*18-7*(23-18) = 9*18-7*23 =  9*(41-23)-7*23 = 9*41-16*23    So -16*23+9*41 = 1.  Looking modulo 41, we see that -16*23 = 1 (mod 41).  And -16 = 41-16 = 25 (mod 41), so 25*23 = 1 (mod 41).|`|VLT2VgP9aa	41 - 23 = 18    To verify, 23 + 18 = 41 = 0(mod 41).    Update:    Good observation John.  When he said he was in Z41, I assumed he meant the additive group Z_41.  I figured if he was in the multiplicative group of units, he would have written it as either U(41) or Z*_41.  If he was referring to the ring Z_41, I figured he would have said he was looking for the unit corresponding to 23, not the inverse.  It just goes to show, if you want good answers, give good details in your questions.

SYZQZGesaa	First of all, suction does not exist. Sucking causes a low pressure environment inside the straw. The outside or environment pressure then forces the liquid to escape the glass (high pressure) and into the straw (low pressure). The limit to what can be achieved is the limit to the atmospheric pressure. That pressure or force can only move a mass a certain distance before all the energy is used or before the work of one is equal to the work of the other. If the glass were placed in a tank where the pressure could be increased beyond that of the atmosphere (1 ATM), greater results could be observed. I hope this is what you were looking for.

MGDV8Q8vaa	It's really pretty simple. Any single covalent bond between two elements is a sigma bond, which means that there is direct orbital overlap between the two elements. Any ADDITIONAL bonds between those two elements are pi bonds (sidewise overlap of orbitals). A coordinate covalent bond is where one element donates both electrons to the bond (usually each element in a covalent bond donates one electron).<br>  <br>  H2O - There are two single bonds between O and H. Single bonds are sigma bonds.<br>  <br>  N2 - There is a triple bond between the two N atoms. The first bond is sigma, and the two additional bonds are pi.<br>  <br>  NH3 - There are three single bonds between N and H, all sigma.<br>  <br>  None of these shows a coordinate covalent bond. As an example of one, take the ammonium ion, NH4+. In NH3, there are three single N-H bonds and an unbonded pair on the N. When an H+ ion (which has no electrons) comes along, N donates its unbonded pair to the H and forms the fourth N-H bond. Once the bond is formed, it is identical to the three other N-H bonds, i.e., it's not "different" because both electrons in the bond came from N.|`|1KnDF5Pcaa	H2O only has sigma bonds.

AA10823062	Mathematically, zero signals the presence of absence. That is why it makes no difference whether you say plus zero or minus zero. There is nothing to add or to subtract. That is also why you cannot basically perform any mathematical function with zero. If you do, you will get answers that make no sense. For example, multiplication. <br>  <br>  If you multiply any number by any other number, your answer will be the same number (1x1=1) or a number that is one of the two numbers (2x1=2) or a number that is neither of the two numbers (2x3=6). But, in the case of multiplying by zero you will always get zero, and nothing but zero, no matter what the other number is. And no matter what the numbers are, you will never, ever, get zero as the answer, unless one of the numbers is zero. For example, 2x6=12 but 3x4=12 also. But to get zero as your answer, one of your numbers must be zero.<br>  <br>  Philosophically, however, zero is the absence of presence. That means, something was present, could be present again, and perhaps it is even present right now, but you (the observer and/or participant) sense only the absence, not the presence of that something. However, if you were not 100% sure and certain that some type of presence of some type of thing is possible, there is no way you could experience the absence of it. <br>  <br>  Pure absence (absence of something that was never present, is not present, and never will be present) is not zero. There is no word for that type of idea. Think of it this way. You could say there are zero neon pink elephants in the world. But that is because you have a word (concept) for the colour (neon pink) and for the animal (elephant). But suppose you had no word for the colour and no word for the animal, then that would be close to pure absence. Not-neon-pink and not-elephant are also words/concepts, so you are not allowed to use those either.<br>  <br>  Basically, something that is not thinkable is not expressible and therefore it is not zero because zero is thinkable and expressible.|`|I4tKqO9Qaa	nothingness, the state of no absolutely no amount.

AA11606721	The biologically useful nitrogen in the system you describe is in the sewage. Plants need nitrogen for life but can only absorb nitrogen when it's in a soluble form (there are a few plants can fix atmospheric nitrogen). If the sewage was processed and incorporated in soil, the nitrogen would quickly leach out and become unavailable to plants (although this element eventually cycles naturally). Holding it in sewage tanks where duckweed can access it, keeps nitrogen available to grow plant tissue - essentially speeding up the recycle rate of nitrogen.<br>  <br>  The chemistry of life that you speak of involves proteins. Proteins are made of amino acids and, in each amino acid, is an amino group with a nitrogen atom. The nitrogen is incorporated into plant proteins, fish eat it and make fish proteins, humans eat it and make human proteins - and we all excrete the extra protein that we can't utilize.<br>  <br>  The economics that makes a system like this useful comes from the fact that we have to fertilize our food crops to put back into the soil the nitrogen (and other nutrients) that plants remove. Nitrogen is both a primary nutrient and water soluble - it leaches out of soils and needs to be constantly replaced to grow green plants. To make fertilizer, we burn liquid gas to make ammonia - 5% of the world's liquid gas goes to this end. It is a non-renewable resource so alternative sources for plant-ready nitrogen are vital.<br>  <br>  The nitrogen cycle:<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Nitrogen_Cycle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a>|`|mRG0W5Yxaa	That's an excellent question.  The thing is, although nitrogen is vital, there's only so much you can do with it, and for us meat-eaters, we take in a whole lot more than we can convert to useful materials like amino acids and such.  It's pretty toxic in more than dilute concentrations, so you don't want it hanging around internally.  It's hard to get rid of, though - it takes a lot of water to flush it out of the body as urea.  Some animals in low-water areas, or that can't carry around large volumes of "flush-water" (think birds) have developed ways to concentrate the nitrogen into semi-solid uric acid solutions and expel it that way.<br>  As to your question about conversion, the photosynthesis pathway doesn't mess with nitrogen compounds (as far as I remember); it's more an energy-transfer mechanism that allows the break-up and recombination of available chemical compounds into stored energy/food material for later use.  That stored energy may conceivably be used to break down the available nitrogen compounds to rebuild into amino acids for the plant's use, but my botany doesn't go that far.  As to animals, why would an animal need such a conversion mechanism when it can get all the amino acids it needs by eating something that already has them?  (hint - do you know of any animals that _don't_ eat either animals or plants?  like, maybe butterflies or other obligate nectar-feeders that don't eat pollen as well?)

NQLfzZ1eaa	The greenhouse effect is the ability of some gases to trap solar radiation in the atmosphere which causes warming.  Water vapor, methane and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases.  What happens is that the sunlight falling on the earth is in the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, but it is radiated back off the earth as infrared radiation which is heat.  The greenhouse gases are transparent to the incoming visible light but they absorb some of the infrared light, resulting in heating of the air.  Without the greenhouse effect caused by these gases the earth would be very cold and  unlivable.  Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere causes the climate to heat up.

With our current knowledge, there is no way to put an object at absolute rest within the universe. The reason I say this is because if something were at absolute rest, we could then measure how fast everything else is moving.

As gravity acts upon the pencil, the pencil tries to hit the floor BUT as it falls to where the floor was, the floor has fallen an equal distance away.

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Most plants store energy (from the glucose molecules that were manufactured using energy from the sun) as starch.  To find the starch, you would have to test the specific parts of the plant with IKI (iodine potassium iodide), which is an indicator for starch.  Its normal color is a yellowish brown, but it turns a blue-black color in the presence of starch.  If you put some on a slice of potato, for example, most of it would turn black.  If you put it on a slice of onion, however, there wouldn't be as much - there's more sugar ion onions, that has not been compounded into starch. yet.

PuDV9IG9aa	In the Bohr model it always starts to fill from the inside, near the nucleus. The first level (or ring) can hold up to two electrons, but no more than two. Then you move to the second level from the nucleus. It can hold up to 8 electrons, but no more than 8 electrons. After that, you move to the third level from the nucleus. That ring can hold up to 18 electrons.     So Na has 2, 8 and 1 or a total of 11 electrons. For an ion, Na would be missing the outside (or valence) electron. That electron would have been pulled off, so the ion would have a charge of positive 1, since it now has 11 positive protons, but only 10 negative electrons to balance them, leaving 1 proton positive charge unbalanced.|`|t4BpFdmdaa	please answer my question thanx

"My son lost his Nintendo DS"   This is a good way to teach him a few lessons.   1) Take care and guard things you care about.  2) The consequence of not taking care of things is losing them.   3) If he is getting that torn up over a Nintendo game, there is something wrong in this picture that probably won't get fixed by finding his DS.     Parent to parent, I think you are nurturing him beyond a healthy degree if you are getting all torn up because he is getting all torn up because he lost his video game.   Do you get what I am saying?

AA11606721	So you accept natural selection; a good start. Now you need to study the rest of evolution, as well as basic biology, the climactic conditions of previous geologic eras, genetics, hox genes, evo-devo, a review of earths biological diversity, ecology, comparative anatomy, etc.    The belief in a "permanence of kinds" is myopic and not really focused at all if you look at all the available evidence. Viewing what we know about life through the lens of science can sharpen your vision enough to see reality, but be careful!

You bang on about Dogs and wolfs and so on, but what about Foxes or the Raccoon dog, other members of the Canidae family.    Or Bacteria, maybe the problem is that most bacteria we know are the ones we study, either those that are harmful to humans, are useful in chemistry or do well in labs.  The reality is that there are probably billions of species of bacteria out there that have never been described by science.    "Measuring the bacterial biodiversity of soil is difficult because only a few species can be cultured in the lab, according to Jason Gans of Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, US"    You see if you actually studied the science and the truth you wouldn't spend so much time on the wing nut websites.  The BS about there being a limit to change is just that, but every science will tell you the limit is available variation and unless we manipulate genes we can't make variation arise, that takes nature and time.  If we do manipulate genes though you'll just claim that's what the creator does, offering zero real evidence as usual.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	I'm sorry, what's your question?

I'm assuming that you remove pennies once they land heads up (we did this for ours) These pennies represent atoms that have changed into other atoms.

In real life, it would take the same amount of time for THAT number to be cut in half, until there are no more atoms to be changed, but the lab can't show that.

raYyGebNaa	You could use the quadratic equation.   But there is an easier way, which I love.    Think of the equation as Ax^2-Bx-C.  Multiply A and C together to get AC (in the case of this problem, -28).    Now, you find multiples of AC that add up to B.  (in the problem, it is -14 and 2)    Then, you rewrite the equation to that it is Ax^2-(Multiple 1x)+(Multiple 2x)-C. (in this equation, 4x^2-14x+2x-7).    You then split up the equation so it is [Ax^2-(Multiple 1x)]+[(Multiple 2x)-C]. (in this equation, it would be [4x^2-14x]+[2x-7]).    Now you factor.  In your equation, it would factor to 2x(2x-7)+1(2x-7).  Notice how the two equations in the parenthesis are the same.  This should always happen when using this technique.     The final answer would be (2x+1)(2x-7).  I hope that I explained this technique well enough, I am not good at explaining things AT ALL.|`|BeaPei4kaa	Here you go,    (2x+7)(2x-1)    If you'd like instructions on how to do this yourself let me know!    -Hilary|`|TdKfsALAaa	Trial and error method:  4x^2 - 12x - 7 = (2x - 7)(2x + 1)|`|mR9ydwz5aa	(2x+2)(x-7)|`|22fca0784b8657563e32d64aab1fae2faa	(2x-7)(2x+1), multiply it out, get 4x^2+2x-14x-7.

He discovered different mockingbirds (as well as finches) on the various islands (Galapagos).  This led him to come to the conclusion that mockingbirds from the mainland had travelled to each island and then changed.

AA10335036	In optics, interference is the result of the path lengths of light rays coming from two or more locations (typically spectroscope slits) differing by an amount that creates additive or cancelling summing effects for a particular wavelength. An integer-wavelength difference produces addition and an integer plus half-wavelength difference produces cancellation. <br>  Diffraction has a similar path length difference mechanism except that, according to the Huygens principle, the entire width of the slit acts as a collection of emission points, so there is a continous variation of path length along the width of a single slit. Thus one analyzes the behavior differently from interference. If there is a one-wavelength difference at the opposite edges of the slit, there is cancellation. This happens because each point in a line from one edge to the center can be paired with a corresponding point in a line from the center to the opposite edge. Each such pair has a half-wavelength difference and thus cancels. This can be extended to any integer-wavelength difference across the slit.<br>  Ref. 1 shows the single-slit mechanism, and ref. 2 describes the differences in the resulting spectroscope display.|`|t9iWZmmQaa	Diffraction is the process whereby a beam of light is split into multiple beams when it passes through a narrow slit or grazes a solid sharp object. Interference is the process whereby beams of coherent light (e.g. from a laser) after undergoing diffraction recombine to give a series of light and dark fringes i.e. a diffraction pattern. Note that interference only occurs between coherent beams of light. You can also create an interference pattern by splitting a coherent beam and sending the two beams by different paths to recombine at a common point.|`|IH0R6fkOaa	As such, there is no difference between interference and diffraction. <br>  Both phenomena are proof for wave nature of light.<br>  In interference, there are two independent light sources. Those waves emanating from these slits might have undergone diffraction themselves  and then produce the interference pattern and that's why a uniform intensity of the bands are observed.<br>  In a broader definition, diffraction is a property of all waves to bend around an obstacle when its dimensions are comparable to the wavelength of the wave propagating.<br>  That is, you take a pond. Throw a stone into it. Then, you will see waves. Just because there is a stick on the water surface(an obstacle) the waves don't stop there(stick is vertical). Rather, the waves bend around it. You will notice that some areas have height of wave higher. This is precisely what diffraction is. <br>  For example, we all know that sound is a wave. So when there is a source of sound and a door between you can hear the sound because the sound waves bend around the door for us to be heard.<br>  Similarly, light bends around a hole and the different waves from the obstacle interfere and produce the bands we all know.<br>  <br>  <br>  However if you want the answer for the Boards, here is it:<br>  INTERFERENCE              -------------                 DIFFRACTION      <br>                                               <br>      Two slits                      ------------                  One slit  <br>                                             <br>      All bands have equal        --------            All bands have diff. intensity     <br>      intensity

rY84Ap6Maa	Dolphins are marine mammals that are closely related to whales and porpoises. There are almost forty species of dolphin in seventeen genera. They vary in size from 1.2 m (4 ft) and 40 kg (90 lb) (Maui's Dolphin), up to 9.5 m (30 ft) and 10 tonnes (9.8 LT; 11 ST) (the Orca or Killer Whale). They are found worldwide, mostly in the shallower seas of the continental shelves, and are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid. The family Delphinidae is the largest in the Cetacea, and relatively recent: dolphins evolved about ten million years ago, during the Miocene. Dolphins are considered to be amongst the most intelligent of animals and their often friendly appearance and seemingly playful attitude have made them popular in human culture.<br>  <br>  Feeding~<br>  <br>  Various methods of feeding exist, not just between species but also within a species. Various methods may be employed, some techniques being used by only a single dolphin population. Fish and squid are the main source of food for most dolphin species, but the False Killer Whale and the Killer Whale also feed on other marine mammals.<br>  <br>  One feeding method employed by many species is herding, where a pod will control a school of fish while individual members take turns plowing through the school, feeding. The tightly packed school of fish is commonly known as a bait ball. Coralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured. In South Carolina, the Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin takes this one step further with what has become known as strand feeding, where the fish are driven onto mud banks and retrieved from there.[25] In some places, Orcas will also come up to the beach to capture sea lions. Some species also whack fish with their fluke, stunning them and sometimes sending fish clear out of the water.<br>  <br>  If you want more, email me on yahoo:)|`|FCRX9MJMaa	They're aquatic mammals.

Why do we have legs on the "bottom" and arms at (or at least near) our "top" sides ?<br>  <br>  Basically, of course, this is because gravity makes a vast difference between "top" or "up" and "bottom" or "down", and, as someone has mentioned, balance comes into this as well when considering the left-right symmetry.<br>  <br>  The short answer to your question, then, is because this symmetry is very useful, and over the history of all species it has proved essential for survival.  Any fish which did only swim in circles would have had a hard time escaping from the first predator which could swim left or right or in a straight line at will.

LoFeJztxaa	The complex number x + iy can be associated with the point (x,y), or the vector from (0,0) to (x,y) in the x-y plane.  Usually, however the vertical axis is thought of as the iy axis.<br>  <br>  With this interpretation complex numbers add line two dimensional vectors.  Real numbers add like one dimensional vectors, i.e. like vectors along the x-axis.<br>  <br>  The complex number z = x + iy, when thought of like a vector, has a magnitude (also called modulus, or absolute value) namely the length of the vector, √(x^2+y^2), often denoted by r or |z|.  It also has an angle associated with it, namely the counterclockwise angle between the positive x-axis and the vector.  This angle is sometimes called the argument of the complex number.<br>  <br>  When you multiply two complex numbers the answer is a complex number which, as a vector, has argument (i.e. angle) the sum of the arguments of the two complex numbers you were multiplying.  The modulus of the product (i.e. of the complex number which is the answer) is the product of the moduli of the two complex numbers you were multiplying.<br>  <br>  Mnemonic:  Add the Arguments, Multiply the Moduli.<br>  <br>  In effect, if you multiply a bunch of complex numbers by a fixed complex number, they will all rotate about the origin (because they have the same angle added to their arguments) and stretch (or shrink) their lengths by the same factor, namely by the magnitude of the complex number you are multiplying them by.  Their new locations are the answers of the multiplications.<br>  <br>  For example, multiplying a complex number by i will rotate it by 90 degrees, since the argument of i  is 90 degrees.  Remember i corresponds to the point (0,1) on the y-axis.  It will not stretch or shrink because the magnitude of i is 1.<br>  <br>  Multiplying by the real number -1 rotates by 180 degrees, since it is the same as multiplying by i twice.  (recall i^2 = -1).

(If y models some physical thing, the constant solutions correspond to "equilibrium" or "steady" states of that thing that do not change with time.)<br>  <br>  To say that y = f(x) is a solution to that equation is to say that<br>  f'(x) = 10 - 2 f(x) for all x.<br>  If a constant function f(x) = c is a solution, then f'(x) = 0 and we read<br>  0 = 10 - 2c.<br>  Solving for c we get 2c = 10 so that c = 5.<br>  <br>  This shows that f(x) = 5 is the only constant solution to that differential equation.  [The non-constant solutions are the functions f(x) = 5 + c e^(-2x), with c a nonzero constant.]

Therefore, we know that there was a total of 30 units consumed.<br>  <br>  (see where this is going?)<br>  <br>  Now, we know that 13 units were a form of pie. Therefore, 17 units are not. <br>  <br>  9 people have turkey.<br>  8 people have corn.<br>  These two must overlap, since there are only 10 people. The minimumal overlap is 8. There are 8 people with both, 1 person with turkey only, and one person with nothing. This means 8 people with 2 slots full, 1 person with one slot full, and one person with no slots full.<br>  <br>  This adds up to (8x2)+(1x1)+(1x0)= 17. 17 slots full.<br>  <br>  Since we know that 30 units were consumed, then the remaining 13 slots must be filled with pie.

Gmvldblraa	This question feels rather strange. The data seem to ask for answers that do not fit the theory.<br>  <br>  The friction force on the box is 22.0 N . It must be to balance the vertical gravity force.<br>  <br>  As the box slides down at some constant speed, at any constant speed, the vertical forces on it must be balanced. This means that the force of friction must be 22 N.<br>  <br>  The Normal force required to produce a friction force of  22 N is <br>  22 / μ   = 22/0.3  = 73.3 N<br>  <br>  Now you can see the difficulty - this force which will let the box slide, is greater than the force used to keep the box still.<br>  I suspect that the question writer has forgotten that the formula<br>  <br>  F(friction) = μ . N   only works to calculate maximum friction possible, not to calculate the actual friction needed.

When a water molecule "pulls" a hydrogen from another water molecule, it loses a hydrogen at the same time, exchanges occur very rapidly.

6r7Z8vIYaa	Abundant evidence supports the major contentions of the seafloor-spreading theory. First, samples of the deep ocean floor show that basaltic oceanic crust and overlying sediment become progressively younger as the mid-ocean ridge is approached, and the sediment cover is thinner near the ridge. Second, the rock making up the ocean floor is considerably younger than the continents, with no samples found over 200 million years old, as contrasted with maximum ages of over 3 billion years for the continental rocks. This confirms that older ocean crust has been reabsorbed in ocean trench systems.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  which, really, simply means everytime the midocean ridge spreads out, the rock gets older the farther out you go.<br>  hope you help !|`|AA11214072	In brief:<br>  (1) The new rocks are continuously formed at the mid-oceanic ridges which act as a spreading  centers. Each pulse of new rock  wedges out or splits the  earlier formed rocks into two parts on either side i.e. the younger rocks are emplaced at the axis and the older or earlier emplaced rocks are pulled apart (into two) at the centre thus forming a kind of sequence like   abcddcba. The older rocks moves away from the axis or moves away laterally  away from the divergent boundaries on either side of the mid-oceanic axis<br>  (2) the oceanic floor (rocks)  is youngest at the spreading centers i.e. mid-oceanic ridges and progressively become older towards the consuming boundaries i.e. at the convergent boundary (subduction zone). <br>  (3) the same is the case of strip magnetic anomalies, the youngest signatures are at the axis of spreading centers and away the signatures are older.<br>  (4) The present ocean configuration is post-Cretaceous hence rocks older than Cretaceous are not found in the sea floor.

E11gNiGNaa	The centripetal acceleration involves the variables v and R.  v is the linear (tangential) speed so you need this number,  Speed is distance divided the time.

Purists say there is no such thing as centrifugal force. There is, you just introduce a Rotating Frame of Reference. Because:<br>  <br>  "A rotating reference frame can have advantages over an inertial reference frame.[15][4] Sometimes the calculations are simpler (an example is inertial circles), and sometimes the intuitive picture coincides more closely with the rotational frame (an example is sedimentation in a centrifuge). By treating the extra acceleration terms due to the rotation of the frame as if they were forces, subtracting them from the physical forces, it's possible to treat the second time derivative of position (relative to the rotating frame) as if it was the absolute acceleration. Thus the analysis using Newton's law can proceed as if the reference frame was inertial, provided the fictitious force terms are included in the sum of forces. For example, centrifugal force is used in the FAA pilot's manual in describing turns.[16] Other examples are such systems as planets, centrifuges, carousels, turning cars, spinning buckets, and rotating space stations."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal...</a><br>  <br>  A. cercumference = pi * 2*r = 3.14 * 1.57 m = 4.93 meters<br>  <br>  v = d/t = 4.93/0.168 = 29.35 m/s<br>  <br>  B.

1d7b7511e9605e45ec55662ad9537ec3aa	officially Called the Republic of Panama.<br>  <br>  Panama's politics take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Panama is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.<br>  <br>  History of govt.:<br>  Pre-Columbian history:<br>  Panama enjoys a rich Pre-Columbian heritage of native populations whose presence stretched back over 11,000 years.<br>  Then came the Spanish conquest in 1501 AD.<br>  After approximately 320 years under the rule of the Spanish Empire, on November 10, 1821, independence from Spain was declared in the small town of La Villa de Los Santos.<br>  <br>  The Panamanian government went through periods of political instability and corruption, however, and at various times in its history, the mandate of an elected president terminated prematurely. In 1968, a coup toppled the government of the recently elected President Arnulfo Arias Madrid, who had twice before been elected but was never able to complete a full term.<br>  Though he never held the position of president, General Omar Torrijos eventually became the de facto leader of Panama. As a military dictator, he was the leading power in the governing military junta and later became an autocratic strong man. Torrijos maintained his position of power until his death in an airplane accident in 1981. During his reign, the Constitution was rewritten by a rubber-stamp assembly, military officers were placed in charge of civilian institutions, and hundreds of opponents of the dictatorship were killed, tortured or exiled. Torrijos, however, was also a charismatic figure. His demagogic populism and infrastructure projects appealed to many, and the clientelist use of jobs at public institutions created a political class dependent on the dictatorship and loyal to his party.<br>  After Torrijos's death, several military strong men followed him as Panama's leader, all while maintaining the dictatorship's policy of installing civilian, puppet presidents: Commander Florencio Flores Aguilar, followed by Colonel Rubén Darío Paredes. By 1983, power was concentrated in the hands of General Manuel Antonio Noriega.<br>  Noriega came up through the ranks after serving in the Chiriquí province and in the city of Puerto Armuelles for a time. He was a former head of Panama's secret police and was an ex-informant of the CIA. But Noriega's implication in drug trafficking by the United States resulted in difficult relations by the end of the 1980s. Eventually, the escalation of tensions led to the freezing of Panama's banking system and the emboldening of Panama's pro-democracy "Civilista" movement.<br>  <br>  In May 1989, Panama's presidential elections were once again rigged by the military dictatorship, and pressure increased on the dictatorship from the Civilista movement, the Panamanian population, and the U.S. Government. The Civilista candidates who were largely believed to have won the elections with a clear majority were brutally beaten up by the dictatorship's henchmen, and tensions heightened tremendously. Noriega's regime armed many civilian supporters and formed irregular paramilitary units in preparation for a confrontation which Noriega explicitly provoked. In December, Noriega declared himself "President for Life."<br>  On December 20 1989, 27,000 U.S. personnel stationed in Panama and flown in from the U.S. invaded Panama in order to remove Noriega. Shortly after his surrender to U.S. forces, Noriega was flown to Florida to be formally extradited and charged by U.S. authorities on drug and racketeering charges. He became eligible for parole on September 9, 2007, but remained in custody while his lawyers fought an extradition request from France. Critics have pointed out that many of Noriega's former allies remain in power in Panama.<br>  <br>  The government of Panama does not collect statistics on the religious affiliation of citizens, but various sources estimate that 75 to 85 percent of the population identifies itself as Roman Catholic and 15 to 25 percent as evangelical Christian.Catholics are found throughout the country and at all levels of society.The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, with some qualifications, and the Government generally respected this right in practice.<br>  <br>  Currency:<br>  The balboa is the currency of Panama. Its ISO 4217 code is PAB. It is named in honour of the Spanish explorer/conquistador Vasco Nú?ez de Balboa. The balboa is subdivided into 100 centésimos.<br>  <br>  As on last 5 days,The value of PAB is same as USD  ( 1USD = 1PAB)<br>  <br>  Panama boasts many famous natives.

Note that in such a sequence A must end the sequence, so henceforth we can just ignore the last game and look at all the games before the last one. Note also that A has 3 games in the sequence and opponent N has either 0, 1, 2 or 3 games in the sequence. If N has i games (for i = 0, 1, 2 or 3), then the sequence will have length i+3 and the number of possible sequences will be (i+3) choose 3 = (i+3)C3 (because you want to choose the positions of A's 3 games out of i+3 possible positions). So altogether there will be 3C3 + 4C3 + 5C3 + 6C3 = 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 35 sequences where A wins. For cases where N wins instead, the exact same argument applies, yielding the same number of sequences. So altogether the number of possible sequences is 35*2 = 70.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Had to wait quite a bit to confirm my answer with another answerer but 'twas worth the wait because we agree. ;) Note to self: use placeholder trick next time k? :D

In the center of the Milky Way the stars are packed in much more tightly than they are out here where we are, and the surface of a terrestrial-type planet would be receiving a considerable amount of gamma, x-ray and particle radiation from space coming from all those other stars and various other objects. Life forms on such a planet would have to either live underground or underwater (a few meters of dirt, water or ice would shield them from almost all the radiation) or have some kind of physiological mechanism to survive with their genetic material intact despite being constantly bombarded with radiation.|`|fzU2hP4yaa	Probably not.  But... "Never say Never".  So who knows?<br>  <br>  There would be problems with radiation, as already noted.  An extraordinarily strong magnetic field might provide enough of a shield, though.  The absence of a real night is not a show-stopper.  Too many close-by stars might make a stable orbit difficult or impossible, but again, without specific examples to look at it is ultimately an open question.  For every problem one could dream up an exception to solve that problem.<br>  <br>  In short, yes it's possible.  Just highly unlikely.|`|jcGeCJnOaa	Sure why not. It would all depend upon the local environment. The Earth circles a star around the galactic core. We just happen to be some 40,000 light years away from it.

The higher stellar density shouldn't have a major impact on the amount of additional radiation a planet receives.

AA10744471	This is one of those questions so bizarre that only serious drugs or an astronomer could be behind it. But it's not as nutty as it might seem. We can rule out one obvious answer right off the bat: the night sky isn't dark merely because the sun goes down. The stars alone ought to be enough to make the night sky intensely bright. <br>  <br>  Think about it this way. If we assume the universe contains an infinity of stars scattered in endless space, we should see a star in any direction we look. It's like being in the middle of a forest--all you can see in any direction is tree trunks. The sky should be so completely filled with pinpoints of light that they should all merge into a uniform white glow. <br>  <br>  Clearly it doesn't work that way, a puzzle astronomers call "Olbers's paradox." Why not? We can nix a few possibilities: The light emitted by the most distant stars is so faint it's below the threshold of vision. Forget it. You can't see an individual glowing atom, but you can see zillions of them massed together in a candle flame. The same ought to hold true of a horde of distant stars. The most distant stars are obscured by interstellar dust. Won't work either. The dust would absorb so much light it'd eventually start glowing itself. <br>  <br>  So what does explain the paradox? After 400 years of debate on the question, there is now fairly wide agreement among astronomers: there just aren't enough stars in the observable universe to fill up the night sky. <br>  <br>  Your reaction to this may be: It took scientists 400 years to come up with that? No wonder we haven't found a cure for the common cold. But I'm making the answer seem simpler than it is. We don't really know how many stars there are. What we do know is that however many there are, we can see only a finite number of them. <br>  <br>  The oldest stars are about 10 billion years old, meaning that the greatest distance starlight can have traveled is 10 billion light-years. So the only stars we could possibly see are those within a 10 billion light-year radius of us--the light from stars farther away has yet to reach us. The few jillion stars in our corner of the cosmos (AKA the "observable universe") don't have the collective candlepower to illuminate the night sky. (True, as time goes on, light from more distant stars does reach us, but meanwhile some close-in stars are dying out.) <br>  <br>  So that's why the night sky is dark. All right, it's a complicated way of telling you what you might have guessed anyway. But sometimes the obvious ain't.|`|e7791a94910b1769a90f0cd34bc6a7ceaa	I believe it was the Olber's Paradox, many years ago, that wondered the same thing.  If stars are evenly spaced and there are an infinite number of them, then the stars that are fainter because they are farther away would be just as bright as nearby ones because there are more of them.  Olber didn't know about stars being scattered in galaxies, which are not exactly evenly spaced, nor did he know about dust clouds or gas clouds in space that keep us from seeing many stars.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is, the Earth shades us from the sun, and the stars are too few and far away to make up the lack of solar lighting.  Pollution has nothing to do with it, because the night sky has always been dark, and actually it is less so now because of pollution.  Of course, in high latitudes and in some seasons, the night sky might be very bright, but that doesn't really enter into the question.|`|sdP1qmCKaa	we may only be able to see the light from a limited number of stars in the universe because the universe itself is expanding. the further away an object is from us, the faster it's receding  - and  because it's space itself that's expanding,  beyond a certain distance space is expanding relative to us at greater than the speed of light - so the light from a source beyond this distance can never reach us<br>  <br>  the impossibility of motion at greater than the speed of light only applies to motion through space, not the expansion of space itself|`|zAgfQgztaa	Stars are hundreds of trillions of miles away, or up to thousands of light years away, so the light will not be strong enough to light up the Earth.|`|695354591fcd4c8acf43d958f3d5442daa	It has nothing to do with stars or the number of stars.

i0ypGmlQaa	1) This one you think of it as follows:<br>  <br>  step 1 --- line up all 25 quantities (25! possibilities)<br>  step 2 --- put the first 5 in packet 1, the next 5 in packet 2, etc.<br>  <br>  Now, in step 2, would it have mattered if the first five were ABCDE or EDBAC? No. Each time you throw guys into the packet, you lose 5! worth of the rearrangement.<br>  <br>  Edit: You can also rearrange the packets any way you like (at first, I misread it as "UNequal packets"), for another 5!. That's a total of six divisions by 5!. Hence:<br>  <br>  Answer = 25! / ( 5! × 5! × 5! × 5! × 5! × 5! ) = 5194672859376<br>  <br>  ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- <br>  <br>  2) This one has a highly-debated answer. The question is whether the circular seating:<br>  <br>  ABCDEFGH<br>  <br>  is the same as:<br>  <br>  HGFEDCBA<br>  <br>  Everyone has the same neighbors, and mathematically I consider this more natural. But some people do not.<br>  <br>  Pick a person to sit somewhere. This does NOT change anything. Now pick a person to be next to that person (7 choices). Now pick someone to be next to that person (6 choices). etc.<br>  <br>  Answer = 7×6×5×4×3×2×1 = 7! = 5040<br>  <br>  My answer, I prefer, is to consider also that "reverse" orders are the same. In that case, just divide by two.<br>  <br>  Answer version two = 7! / 2 = 2520<br>  <br>  ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- <br>  <br>  3) Here, let's consider the number of digits. It can't use all five, or fewer than three, or else it would be too big or too small.<br>  <br>  So what can we do with the four-digit possibilities? Any of them work, so that's fine, and you get (5C4) to choose the digits, and 4! to arrange the digits.<br>  <br>  If you allow repetition, it's just 5^4 since you have 4 choices from 5 digits.<br>  <br>  And the three digit possibilities? They MUST start with 5, so focus on the other two digits. You pick two (4C2) and then arrange them (2!).<br>  <br>  If you allow repetition, it's just 5^2.<br>  <br>  So the total is:<br>  Without repetition - (5C4)4! + (4C2)2! = 120 + 12 = 132<br>  With repetition - 5^4 + 5^2 = 625 + 25 = 650<br>  <br>  ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- <br>  <br>  3) Redo: Sorry, I missed the word "odd" in that question.<br>  <br>  So now consider picking the digits from right to left (pick the 1s digit first). If you have four digits (like above), it can be any four digit number. So pick an odd (3 choices) for the 1s place. Then pick anything (4 choices) for the 10s place, anything (3 choices) for the 100s place, and anything (2 choices) for the 1000s place.<br>  <br>  That's 3×4×3×2 = 72<br>  If repetition is okay, it just changes to 3×5×5×5 = 375.<br>  <br>  Now in the three digit case, it's harder. You have to start with a 5, and then you have to pick from the remaining odds, so you have only 2 choices for the 1s digit, and then 3 for the 10s digit (the 100s digit was already chosen as 5).<br>  <br>  That leaves only 2×3 = 6 possibilities.<br>  With repetition, it's 3×5 = 15.<br>  <br>  The sum total is:<br>  Without repetition: 72 + 6 = 78<br>  With repetition: 375 + 15 = 390

Atm74ULtaa	Mars<br>  <br>  The magnitude scale works in a kind of backwards manner because brighter objects are given lower values. This means that a magnitude 1 object is brighter than a magnitude 2 object. It also means that a magnitude 0 object is brighter than a magnitude 1 object. Even brighter objects are given a negative value and hence a magnitude -1 object is brighter than a magnitude 0 object.<br>  <br>  Thus, Mars at magnitude +0.5 is somewhat brighter than Spica, which has a magnitude of +0.9.<br>  <br>  By the way, there is no real calculation involved with this question and therefore the distance to Spica and the radius of Mars are not needed. Instead, this question is all about whether or not you understand how the magnitude scale works and hopefully you now know.

9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	The theory of relativity tells us that much of the universe can behave as particles or as waves depending on conditions and the testing method.  The photon is the particle representation of electromagnetic energy, which is more often thought of as waves being transmitted and we talk of wave length, etc.   The reason Einstein got his Nobel was not for Relativity but for his explanation of the photoelectric effect with photons.<br>    Basically, photons are massless packets of energy that move at the speed of light (because they are massless) and the amount of energy it takes to create one and send it off depends on the apparent frequency of the light/radiation.  It was first used to explain why all the energy in a heated object doesn't immediately escape as radiation across the endless electromagnetic spectrum - it takes more and more energy to make a photon as the wavelengths get shorter so we see a glowing red at lower energy and blue heat at higher (and so on.)<br>    When a photon strikes, its energy will move an electron from a lower orbit to a higher orbit in a molecule and when the electron falls back, it will emit a photon.  But with enough energy and in certain semiconductors, the electrons are knocked free and can reduce the resistance or make a current that can be used.<br>    A photon is composed of a distortion in the time-space structure of the universe.  A wave in water is the energy of it rising and falling under gravity - it not composed of water - if you try to capture the wave you have a puddle. <br>    If you are really into it, take a look at "A Briefer History of Time" which is much easier to read than the bulky Hawking original "A Brief History of Time" which is loaded with math and physics.  May be in the library, where I found it.|`|KHjYq2bHaa	The photon literally is a bundle of energy. Each metal has a property called the work function. This is the minimum amount of energy required to release an electron off the surface of the metal.<br>  <br>  A photon of light has a specific amount of energy. If the energy of the photon is greater than the work function, an electron is released and starts to flow as current. This is the photolectric effect.

2OlK71nyaa	Ahhh... finally a question I can answer! LOL. Well mitosis is EXTREMELY important because when we are first made(when the egg and sperm combine) we are only one cell. Mitosis is the process of interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telaphase, and cytokinesis. Basically it is the process of a cell dividing. If our cells never divided, then we would never be born. For example, we have trillions and trillions of cells, even though we started from only one. You see, when you start out as one cell, you have no nothing. No ears, no eyes, just a small blob in existence. Then mitosis happens; that one cell that is you is pulled apart into two cells. Then those two cells are each pulled in two. Then those two, and those two, and so on and so on. Your cells never truly stop dividing until you are fully grown. So in conclusion, if our cells never divided, then we would still be just one lone cell.|`|Jsvz996Baa	it is important b/c that's when nucleus divides into 2 nuclei<br>  that's when it goes into the 4 phases:prophase,metaphase,anaphase,and telophase|`|zNkuENeHaa	because it makes cells....<br>  and if mitosis didnt happen, cells would die and everything would end|`|c7T4m720aa	Its Important because mitosis is used to divide more cells because the parent cell gets too big and more cells are needed to be constantly divided.

This err was to affect his entire future. Disagreements with Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens caused Newton to withdraw from the public. It caused him to rewrite Principia several times. It caused him to withhold much of his works from publication fearing that he had insufficient proof of his theorums. In 1684 he published his work on ellipses but much of his work was not released until after his death. So for the most part, he was isolated, unsure of his works without complete proofs, and he lacked money.|`|Atm74ULtaa	Try these links...

LRns6R5iaa	I understand your confusion in the general sense.  As your question does not specify a particular area of trouble, I'll just say a couple basic things and hope they help.  <br>  <br>  FORMULAS are an outline or "skeleton" if you will for solving a particular generic problem.  An example is the quadratic formula.  After substituting your values into a particular formula, you will now have an EQUATION.  After solving for the unknown (if necessary, some formulas are already solved...the entire unknown is alone on one side of the = sign), you now have your solution.<br>  <br>  It is important to keep the terms separate in your head.  <br>  Formulas --> Way to approach a given "problem" (another example is something like the Ideal Gas Law Formulated as PV=nRT).<br>  Equations --> May or may not be derived from a formula, as it could just be some random example your teacher picks out, but it is the implentation of substitution of known values, attempting to get the value you are trying to determine alone on one side of the = (solving).<br>  <br>  Try not to get overwhelmed.  Take it step-by-step.  Maybe look only at one portion of the equation, or try to figure out which way would be easiest and therefore be least likely to cause you to err and be less frustrating.<br>  <br>  There's a lot more to say, but I'll stop and let others answer with general or specific advice.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Remember the famous riddle: How do you get to Carnegie Hall?  Practice, Practice, Practice.  Same for just about anything else.

AA10929714	The sum of the rock's kinetic and potential energy is conserved once it's in flight.  The potential energy change (relative to the starting height of the rock) is given by:<br>  <br>  PE = m*g*h<br>  <br>  where m is the mass of the rock,<br>  h is the height of the rock above the starting point<br>  g is the acceleration of gravity<br>  <br>  Note that the product m*g is the weight of the rock, in units of force (newtons).<br>  <br>  The kinetic energy of the rock is given by:<br>  <br>  KE = 0.5*m*v^2<br>  <br>  where v is the speed of the rock.<br>  <br>  As the rock leaves your hand, it's potential energy relative to the starting point is zero (by definition) and if v_i is the initial speed of the rock as it leaves your hand, it's kinetic energy is 0.5*m*(v_i)^2.  <br>  <br>  At 10m above the starting point, the rock has gained 10m * 15 N = 150 J of potential energy.  That increase in potential energy is balanced by a decrease in the kinetic energy, so that the total energy remains the same as when the rock was initially thrown  The kinetic energy when the rock is 10m high is 17 m/s, so we have that:<br>  <br>  <br>  0.5*m*(v_i)^2 = 0.5*m*(17m/s)^2 + 150J<br>  <br>  v_i = sqrt[2*(150J + 0.5*m*(17m/s)^2)/m]<br>  <br>  In round numbers, g = 10 m/s^2, so the mass of the rock is:<br>  <br>  m = 10N/(10 m/s^2) = 1kg<br>  <br>  Plugging this in and calculating v_i gives:<br>  <br>  v_i = 24 m/s<br>  <br>  (Using a more accurate value for g gives v_i = 24.15 m/s)<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  At the top of its trajectory, the speed of the rock is momentarily zero, so it has no kinetic energy;  all of the initial kinetic energy is present as gravitational potential energy, so:<br>  <br>  0.5*m*(v_i)^2 = m*g*h_max<br>  <br>  where h_max is the maximum height<br>  <br>  h_max = (0.5*(v_i)^2)/g<br>  <br>  Again using the approximation that g = 10m/s^2, we get:<br>  <br>  h_max = 59 m<br>  <br>  (Using the actual value for g gives 59.47 m).

A body is in static equilibrium when the net force and the net torque on the body are both zero. zero net force means that the center of mass does not accelerate. Zero net torque means that there is no tendancy to rotate. In dynamic equilibrium an object is moving but its movement does not change. An object in motion remains in motion, it has a velocity but not an acceleration. No acceleration then F = ma = 0.

When you divide both sides by 7/12 then the 7/12 on the left goes away and then x is left on the left side. on the right side you divide 3/14 by 7/12. to divide fractions you could use your calculator or......do it on paper. To divide 3/14 by 7/12 you have to flip the 7 and the 12 and get 12/7 and then multiply that by 3/14 (thats just the rule for dividing fractions). so then you got 3/14 times 12/7. you multiply top to top and bottom to bottom. 3 times 12 equals 36. 14 times 7 equals 98. thus its answer is 36/98 which can be reduced to 18/49.

Just in case you didn't know, a quantity is all the stuff inside the parenthesis.<br>  <br>  We now need to divide out some numbers so that the quantities are the same. Why do we want to do this? You will see in a moment. <br>  <br>  For the quantity (15y^2 + 25y) we can divide out a 5y from both terms<br>  <br>  We end up with <br>  <br>  5y(3y^ + 5)<br>  <br>  Now we do it with the (-6y - 10)<br>  <br>  We can take out a -2 from both terms in this quantity<br>  <br>  -2(3y + 5)<br>  <br>  Why did i take out a -2 instead of just 2? Because remember, we wanted to make the quantities the same. And in the previous quantity, we factored (15y^2 + 20y) to 5y(3y + 5), both positive 3y and 5. So we want (-6y - 10) to turn to (3y + 5), not (-3y -5), and so we divide by a negative. <br>  <br>  Now our equation is...<br>  <br>  5y(3y + 5) - 2(3y + 5)<br>  <br>  Notice that the two quantities are now being subtracted because i had taken out a negative 2. <br>  <br>  Now here is the amazing part. The two quantities are like terms! :0<br>  <br>  "But that doesn't look like like terms!" you might say.<br>  <br>  Well look here. 3y is the same as 3 x y right? and 2y is 2 x y also. <br>  And so we can combine 3y and 2y because they are multiplied by the same thing. We multiply them as 3 + 2 (y), or just 5y.<br>  <br>  In our equation  5y(3y + 5) - 2(3y + 5), you can see that both 5y and -2 are being multiplied by the SAME thing. Sure they are in parenthesis, but (3y +5) = (3y +5). And so they are like terms. And so we can combine them. Only we can't add 5y and -2 because they are not like terms. So we just stick parenthesis around them. <br>  <br>  Our new and finally factored equation is<br>  <br>  (5y - 2)(3y + 5)<br>  <br>  <br>  Tadaa! Wasn't that amazing?

mpdTpXGUaa	It's the movement of WATER through a selectively permeable membrane and is driven by water potential.  If there is sucrose on one side of the semi permeable membrane and pure water, water will diffuse across to the side with sucrose.  Remember it is the movement of water.  The water potential equals the concentration gradient + the pressure gradient.  Water will move from a low solute concentration which has a high water potential to an area of high solute concentration where there is low water potential.  <br>  <br>  the solute potential is 0 when it's pure water and negative if there is a solute.  the pressure gradient is positive in a healthy plant cell when there is turgor pressure.  It is negative when the cells lack water (less pressure).<br>  <br>  For the poster above, a cell is hypertonic when water moves outside of the cell making it dehydrated (like ethanol on cell).  A cell is hypotonic when water moves into the cell.  Red blood cells in water will burst because of the water pressure inside due to the water flowing inside the cell.|`|qTGEblHZaa	Osmosis is a diffusion of fluid through a semipermeable membrane from a solution with a low solute concentration to a solution with a higher solute concentration until there is an equal concentration of fluid on both sides of the membrane.<br>  <br>  Try these websites:|`|aBSTz1v9aa	yeah, there is something about hypertonic and hypotonic solutions (cant remember which is which) but one would cause a cell to shrink(due to a higher concentration outside the cell), and the other would cause the cell to swell (due to a higher concentration inside the cell)|`|U5nwTswfaa	Osmosis is the diffusion of small particles across a permeable barrier. So any small atom/molecule can undergo osmosis, not just water. These particles always follow their concentration gradient i.e. they won't flow from a lower conc to a higher conc. Other than that, you've pretty much got it.

k5Ece8BTaa	No, the world won't end in 2012 and planet x don't exist.<br>  <br>  This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage? <br>  <br>  ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.<br>  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.<br>  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.<br>  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.<br>  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes. <br>  ? No coment will hit Earth or asteriods.<br>  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.<br>  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.<br>  <br>  Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	No and no.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Slightly out of context answer:<br>  <br>  Yes, the Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is real. It does not end.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=aztec+..." rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?q=aztec+...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.azteccalendar.com/azteccalend..." rel="nofollow">http://www.azteccalendar.com/azteccalend...</a><br>  <br>  The Aztecs conquered the Mayans and absorbed the Mayan culture. There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.<br>  <br>  Ok. I'll try to explain a little more. Remember, this is important because it happens at a WINTER SOLSTICE in the northern hemipshere. The Sun will align within 1 degree of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy on a winter solstice as predicted by the Mayans. There is a radio star call Sagitarius A*, usually abbreviated Sag A*, at -6 degrees declination on the celestial sphere. Sag A* is not AT the center of the Milky Way  galaxy. There is a 30 million solar mass black hole, a dimensional singulairty AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Anything else AT the center goes down the black hole, which is NOT made of the densenst material known. If you want to look toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, go outside in mid August abhout half an hour after sunset. Look to the south. The Constellation Sagitarius has a famous asterism known as "The Teapot". Wait until it almost completely dark and you might be able to see the Milky Way running from Sagitarius through the Summer Trinage of the bright stars <br>  Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra, (which is straight overhead at sunset in mid-August), and Deneb in Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross.|`|S9ZyjTyyaa	according to the history channel|`|c6oobrlAaa	Believe what you wanna believe|`|dd235370a6c4569337cc8a8e1d335770aa	i sure hope not|`|WJlNLw7Paa	most people are speculating this is the "end of the world" because of the mayan calendar.<br>  <br>  it's when time ends for then, not necessarily the end of the world. the end of the world has been predicted numerous times.|`|f3ff298590ac17cdea718200939fbcc2aa	Of course not.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJjQMwEjC1I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJjQMwEjC...</a>|`|Xww9vGWPaa	Yep, Dec. 21, 2012.

This means its path will be determined by its speed (you got that speed when you were using your engines) and whatever gravity source may be nearby.  <br>  <br>  The planet's gravity will attract the spacecraft as it gets closer.  If you're moving fast enough Mars will curve your path towards it, but you will sling past it and keep going.  Its gravity wasn't strong enough to stop you.  If you're going slow enough Mars' gravity will seize you and pull you in - you crash into it.  If you're going the exact right speed you will swing past Mars, but the planet will have slowed you down enough that you will rise above, slow to a near stop and fall back, going faster and faster.  Then you will swing past again, slow down and fall back... this is called an orbit.<br>  <br>  In a real spaceflight engines will be used at carefully calculated times to adjust speed and direction so Mars' gravity will do exactly the right thing.

The mass of the planet will remain approximately the same.

MqFBxh65aa	instead of passing out the candies one at a time she is passing them out ten at a time after making sure that she has enough left at each step to give every person ten candies.  ( she knows how to multiply the number of people by ten so she knows how many she needs to have so as to make it possible for each person to get ten.)<br>  <br>  lets say she has 161 that she wants to divide among 7 people.  NOTE: if she is passing them out ten at a time, she will need to have at least 70 pieces left.<br>  So, she starts out with 161, which is more than 70, and so she knows she can give everyone ten pieces.  this leaves 91 pieces.<br>  91 pieces is still more than 70, so she can give everyone ten more pieces.  Now everyone has twenty pieces, but she only has 21 pieces left.  This is less than 70, so she can no longer pass them out ten at a time. In fact she only has enough left to give everyone 3 pieces.<br>  <br>  so everyone got 10 + 10 + 3 = 23 pieces.

NwbgvzfXaa	Muscles use chemical and electrical energy to produce mechanical work through a complex process. Below is a brief and simple explanation.<br>  <br>  Muscles produce mechanical work through a process called contraction. This occurs when the muscle fibers pull in or shorten. This is triggered by the brain with an electrical impluse to the nerves of the muscles. The amount of muscle mass determines the strength of this contraction force.<br>  <br>  If you need more details, visit the source link I posted below.<br>  .|`|htDt7l3Taa	Muscles are really kind of a power converter. They take chemical/electrical  energy from your brain and convert it to mechanical energy. In so many words, when you think about useing your arm a chemical event takes place in your brain that sends electricity to your arm muscles making your arm move.. Moving your arm, carrying something, whatever, is mechanical energy|`|c1a600e6083d6130287db4610398bcd3aa	I'm afraid I can't answer your question as well as I'd like but I think I can improve on your first two answers.  <br>  <br>  Energy is supplied to your body largely by the carbohydrates that you eat.  The body can also use fat as an energy source but it can metabolise fat only relatively slowly.  From these sources the body makes glucose which circulates in the bloodstream and can be converted in the muscles to mechanical energy.  I don't know the exact chemistry of this conversion but the signals from the brain are only the control function - they supply only commands, not the actual energy or mechanical work.|`|AA10456122	you can't create (produce) energy! or destroy it....remember??<br>  however, you can call the transfer of energy mechanical in this case.

xx7w6uH0aa	This question is a little hairy, so I explain this presuming that you understand something about vector calc.  <br>  <br>  The problem with Amp's equation is that in vector calc, there is a theorem that states that a curl of a divergence is ALWAYS zero.  So let V be a del operator, and * be the dot product operator., and x be the cross product operator.<br>  <br>  If V*(VxB) = 0, That also implies that V*J where J is the displacement current, is also 0.  We of course know this isn't true since V*J = dp/dt, where dp/dt is the change in charge density over time.  To put this simply, dp/dt can not be true, since a changing magnetic field can create a changing electric field, and thus, a current.  <br>  <br>  So to put things simply, the reason the inconsistency occurs is because of alternating currents.<br>  <br>  If you need help visualizing this concept, think of an alternating current in a RLC circuit.  Visualize the capacitor, when you flip on a switch.  One side of the capacitor becomes charged with a positive voltage, the other with a negative.  This implies that the charge density on one side of the plate is increasing.  With positive charge on one side--negative charge on the other.  By manipulating the switch, you can manipulate the voltage and the charge on the capacitor.  But the point is, you are creating a AC current by messing with the switch, and in essence, this is the problem with Amp's Law.

Gmvldblraa	Its a vibrating electric field , magnetic field, electric field, magnetic field....<br>  <br>  Lasers can ionise some atoms but you are right in that such ionisation is not relevant to the formation of photons.<br>  <br>  Photons come out of atoms when an electrons loses energy. As it loses energy the electron shifts ( we like to think, downwards). That shift seems to shake the space around. That bit of shake, moves the next bit of space, which moves the next bit and the moving  bit IS the photon. It really isn't anything, just a shifting patch of space - a piece of energy.<br>  <br>  This is really, really hard. If you keep thinking on it and working on it, then you might be the one to finally explain what is really going on to the rest of us. I'm not being smart about this - nobody knows how to put it any better than I just did and all know that that wasn't very helpful. <br>  Good luck|`|rsTB7D1zaa	A photon for all practical purposes is a quanta of electromagnetic energy.<br>  <br>  The energy difference between bound states must be carried away, and the process is by the release (or perhaps creation is more accurate) of a photon, which carries away that exact energy.  <br>  <br>  Lasers don't exactly excite atoms until they emit light so much as they force atoms in to the same state and then cascade off the energy by releasing a large amount of photons simultaneously.  You're right though, it does not ionize (if it did then it would be reasonable to think its an electron).<br>  <br>  Maybe what you're getting caught up on is you're forcing in your mind a conservation of particle number.  In the real world, you have 2 apples and 3 bananas you throw them around and you'll still end up with 2 apples, 3 bananas.  In particles, you toss around some electrons, neutrons and protons you don't always have the same things.  You can end up with pions, neutrinos, and photons among others.  Colliders between two protons can actually produce a 3rd proton and a 4th particle -- anti-proton.  It depends on what energy is involved here.  Since photon is 0 mass, it can be produced any time that an electromagnetic process is involved that results in the change of energy and does not alter charge (this would require the weak force, or the energy is carried away in electron anti-electron neutrino pairs, for example).|`|xx7w6uH0aa	Yeah Rex, I think I can put it better.<br>  <br>  A photon in essence is a Electromagnetic wave.  When you excite an electron, and give it a certain amount of energy, that electron will instantly release that energy.  The reason this occurs is that electrons can only exist in certain energy levels with particular energys.  Once they obtain an energy above and beyond that energy level, they relase that energy in the form of a photon, which is a electromagnetic wave.|`|DphsXWkOaa	Photons are zero mass packets of energy (proved by Albert Einstein when he solved the mystery behind the photoelectric effect). Atoms release photons, because as an electron moves from a high energy state to a low energy state, it releases one photon- only one. The wavelength of the photon depends on how many energy levels the electron "drops". Now, keep in mind, a photon, or a "quanta", is also a wave, hence the wave particle duality. If you want to learn more, pick up a book on quantum mechanics, very interesting, confusing, frustrating and rewarding.

We know that it is not mathematically legal to take the log of zero or a negative number. <br>  <br>  So to keep from being arrested by the math cops, we must make sure that whatever is inside the function is always positive or > 0. The math way of saying this is x^2 > 0.<br>  <br>  We know that if you put a negative number into x^2, it comes out positive. Same for a positive number. However, put a zero into x^2 and you get a zero.

OkJNoU9Uaa	Soil Types in the USA:<br>  <br>  Sandy Soils<br>  <br>  Sandy Soils have a gritty texture and are formed from weathered rocks such as limestone, quartz, granite, and shale. If sandy soil contains enough organic matter it is easy to cultivate, however it is prone to over-draining and summer dehydration, and in wet weather it can have problems retaining moisture and nutrients. <br>  <br>  Silty Soil<br>  <br>  Silty soil is considered to be among the most fertile of soils. Usually composed of minerals (predominantly quartz) and fine organic particles, it has more nutrients than sandy soil yet still offers good drainage. When dry it has rather a smooth texture and looks like dark sand. Its weak soil structure means that it is easy to work with when moist and it holds moisture well.<br>  <br>  Clay Soil<br>  <br>  When clay soils are wet they are very sticky, lumpy and pliable but when they dry they form rock-hard clots. Clay soils are composed of very fine particles with few air spaces, thus they are hard to work and often drain poorly - they are also prone to water logging in spring. Blue or grey clays have poor aeration and must be loosened in order to support healthy growth. Red colour in clay soil indicates good aeration and a "loose" soil that drains well. As clay contains high nutrient levels plants grow well if drainage is adequate.<br>  <br>  Loamy Soil<br>  <br>  Considered to be the perfect soil, Loamy soils are a combination of roughly 40 % sand, 40% silt and 20% clay. Loamy soils can range from easily workable fertile soils full of organic matter, to densely packed sod. Characteristically they drain well, yet retain moisture and are nutrient rich, making them ideal for cultivation.<br>  <br>  Peaty Soil<br>  <br>  Peaty soil contains more organic material than other soils because its acidity inhibits the process of decomposition. This type of soils contains fewer nutrients than many other soils and is prone to over-retaining water. Through good management and use of fertiliser and artificial drainage excellent plants can be grown.<br>  <br>  Chalky Soil<br>  <br>  Chalky soils are alkaline, usually light brown in colour, and contain large quantities of stones of varying sizes. They dry out quickly in the summer and have a tendency to block trace elements such as iron and manganese so that they are unavailable to plants - this in turn causes poor growth and yellowing of leaves. Chalky soil is extremely poor quality and needs regular, substantial addition of fertilizers and other soil improvers.<br>  <br>  This was just an overview of the different types of soils within the U.S.A.

Because entropy continues to increase in the contracting phase, the contraction would appear very different from the time reversal of the expansion. While the early universe was highly uniform, a contracting universe would become increasingly clumped. Eventually all matter would collapse into black holes, which would then coalesce producing a unified black hole or Big Crunch singularity.|`|WgHIEPvGaa	The universe is actually a bit of all three!

xq312zFHaa	You are given:<br>  <br>  Find an nth degree polynomial function with real coefficients satisfying the given conditions.<br>  n=3<br>  2 and 2i are zeros<br>  f(1)= -30<br>  <br>  Right off you are given the polynomial order and 2 zeros (roots)<br>  The polynomial order is 3, therefore:<br>  <br>  P(x) = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d<br>  <br>  You are also give a zero (root) at x = 2. For the moment, assume it is a simple root. If the zero (root) = 2, the associated monomial is <br>  x - 2. If you plug 2 into (x - 2) you get zero.<br>  <br>  So now we have<br>  <br>  P(x) = (x - 2) * R(x).<br>  <br>  Since we know that P(x) is a 3rd order polynomial and one term of P(x) is x-2, we know that R(x) is a quadratic. Thus<br>  <br>  P(x) = (x - 2) *(ax^2 + bx + c)<br>  <br>  Quadratics are easier to  deal with than cubic. Why? Because you can use the quadratic formula (sqrt means square root),<br>  <br>  r1,2 = [-b + or -sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a<br>  <br>  You can assume that a = 1 in R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. This simplifies to<br>  R(x) = x^2 + bx + c and makes the quadratic formula:<br>  <br>  r1,2 = [-b + or - sqrt(b^2 - 4c)] / 2<br>  <br>  We are given that the second zero (root) of P(x) is 2i. We know that there is a 3rd root of P(x) because P(x) is a cubic polynomial. The first root of P(x) has already been dealt with. <br>  <br>  Therefore we can focus on R(x) = x^2 + bx + c with worry about our first root x = 2.<br>  <br>  Now recall the quadratic formula for R(x) -<br>  <br>  r1,2 = [-b + or - sqrt(b^2 - 4c)] / 2<br>  <br>  One zero (root) is 2i. The only way to have an imaginary part is for <br>  b^2 - 4c < 0. <br>  <br>  But look at the given zero (root). It is 2i and *has no real part*. The only way this can happen is for b = 0. Why? Set = 0 and see what we get-<br>  <br>  r1,2 = + or - sqrt(- 4c)] / 2<br>  <br>  The above is a lot simpler. Now take your given zero (root) 2i and put it into the above version of the quadratic formula:<br>  <br>  2i = + or - sqrt(- 4c)] / 2<br>  <br>  Since you requested that I only show the way, I will say this: solve for c in<br>  <br>  2i = + or - sqrt(- 4c)] / 2<br>  <br>  and you will have your answer. After that, plug x = 1 into P(x) for checking|`|QCTdN4HBaa	We need a third degree polynomial.<br>  2 and 2i are zeros, so<br>  (x-2) and (x-2i) are factors.<br>  Now, because 2i is a root, so is -2i.<br>  This is because complex roots always occur in conjugate pairs.<br>  (More generally, if a+bi is a complex root, then a-bi must also be a root)<br>  Hence, the factors are (x-2) (x-2i) and (x+2i)<br>  The polynomial is c*(x-2)*(x-2i)*(x+2i) for some constant c.<br>  We know f(1) = -30, so plug in 1 into the polynomial to get<br>  c*(-1)*(1-2i)*(1+2i) = -c*(1 + 4) = -5c<br>  So setting c = -30/-5 = 6 will make it work.<br>  The answer is<br>  6*(x-2)*(x^2 + 4) = 6x^3 - 12x^2 + 24x -48.

At (3,-4), it's positive!|`|1enLiYkMaa	with the xy what you do is use the product rule.<br>  <br>  so when you differentiate<br>  <br>  (x*(1)*(dy/dx)+(y(1)))+5+6x=0<br>  <br>  then you solve for dy/dx<br>  (dy/dx)*x = -y-6x-5<br>  <br>  dy/dx = (-y-6x-5)/x

He was the first Greek, and the first man in general, to present an explicit argument for a heliocentric model of the solar system, placing the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the known universe. <br>  <br>  He was influenced by the Pythagorean Philolaus of Kroton, but, in contrast to Philolaus, he had both identified the central fire with the Sun, as well as putting other planets in correct order from the Sun. <br>  <br>  His astronomical ideas were rejected in favor of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy until they were successfully revived nearly 1800 years later by Copernicus and extensively developed and built upon by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton.<br>  <br>  The crater Aristarchus on the Moon is named in his honor.|`|XojxC4xxaa	The Earth DOES rotate around the Sun!

hkGEy88xaa	since y=4 is a straight horizontal line, then the only option that passes thru given point, and perpendicular to y=4 is x=9|`|xYYosbq1aa	yes, it would have to be x=9.<br>  because y = 4 would just look like a straight horizontal line on a graph, and to be perpendicular, it has to cross through that line and form a right angle, so the only option is x=9, for you know it passes through that point.
BuvQ8tuuaa	Get a good quality sealable plastic container, put the sodium hydroxide in it, take it to the school, and ask your instructor to dispose of it for you.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can try neutralizing the entire container, but that would require buying either a lot of vinegar or a stronger acid.  I don't recommend getting more chemicals for your garage, which is why I recommend letting the school have it.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you could call your local law enforcement and have them come do a "hazardous chemical cleanup/retreival" in your garage, if you are that concerned about it.|`|acbqsZZbaa	I would say wait for a rainy day. Fill a bucket with cold water and slowly tip your drain cleaner into it, while stirring with a stick to mix it. Be careful, it may get hot. Then slowly pour the diluted solution down a drain, being really careful not to splash any on yourself. The rainwater in the main sewer will dilute it to a harmless concentration.
