When the economy gets worse, seems like thrift stores such as the Salavation Army are putting up their prices even more. Are they suffering from Inflation or something?  I mean, they get the goods for free so why raise the prices up.  Value Village as well.  They are just terrible.  What is going on?  You have to be 80 to get a discount at most of these places.

20090130194518AAm4SM3	Local Businesses;United States;Other - US Local Businesses	Buying Home Depot store credit...?	There is a guy on criags list selling his home depot "store credit."   1. Is this a gift card or do they have a seprate card for "store credit" (like he returned something without the reciept so they gave him store credit).   2. I was reading that they give you store credit if you pay for an item with a check and then return it before 15 days is up. So my concern is that this guy bought something with a bum check and then the next day returned it for store credit and when his check does not clear they will cancel the store credit?   We thought of having home depot just transfer the amount onto our own store credit or gift card, but that could mean still problem if he used bum check and he could call and cancel the gift card that was bought with "his" store credit.      So you can see my concern, but my husband says it will be fine and we will go in to cerify the credit left on the card (the guy told me it was a gift card and my husband it was a card for store credit)...is there a difference.      I'm sure you see my concerns, what should we do? The card is for 649 and he said he'd sell it to us for 500 becuase he's trying to make his rent.
