GuOJIftAaa	Around 5 weeks of age. They should be rather noticeable by then as that is when they're able to breed.<br>  <br>  Also. If your cousin doesn't have a same sex friend for the little one, he really needs one. They're very social animals and it doesn't matter how much time you spend with it, they need other rats to groom and sleep with.|`|CUsqvrDPaa	Their testicles are usually pretty obvious from about 6 weeks onwards-which is also from when they can start to breed, so you'd say they are sexually mature at this age.|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	I bought a male rat that was already 6 months or so.  His testicles were dropped already.  He did not breed though until he was almost a year old. Hope this helps a little.|`|M1J4xDJgaa	he should have two rats|`|44kEtDvIaa	Varies, but usually in the 6-7week range.  Site below has more info on rats plus good rodent links you can check.
YljJscpUaa	don't panice your guinea pig will be fine  i swear it happened to me when i got my first guinea pig i drop it and she bite her lip and if he is eating and drinking ok he should be fine and if you think he not that well and you think something is wrong then bring him to the vet hope everything is ok :)|`|91wc12kvaa	its fine! i had one and the same thing happened. it will b fine but 2 make sure i brought it 2 the vet and they said it will b fine and theres rly nothing u can do. its good if its drinking water.|`|DT4PHmukaa	He may have bit his lip. Probably fine but you should keep an eye on it.|`|EUNdQJAvaa	awwwwww =[<br>  i love piggies|`|N04cJNeKaa	he bit his lip when he fell...<br>  dont worry...<br>  only if it gets soar take him to the vet just to be sure...=D<br>  kiss ur guinea pig 4 me !!!|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	To relieve your stress, I suggest you take you guinea pig to the vet.
hKVOw1Sjaa	It depends on what sort of break it has its weight and the post operative care.As a vet nurse unless l know what sort of break it was l cannot give  you an exact estimate.If a Clean break without the necessity of a pin it will not cost a fortune but if it requires some hardware and a lot of after care yes you will bee paying up to around $1500-2000,then it depends where you live and what vet you have taken your cat to as vets differ in prices greatly in Australia and although you are willing to pay you also do not want to be taken to the cleaners either.if you live in an affluent capital city suburb then Yes the cost will be much more than in a less up market area.<br>  If you live in the Country you may not have many choices if a small town.l also live in Australia so know the vet scene pretty well.|`|4aAhEK9daa	No one on here can give you anything close to an accurate answer to your question.  There's SO many factors:<br>  <br>  - how badly is the leg broken?  That will determine how much surgery is involved<br>  - which vet are you going to?  Not only do vet prices vary from country to country, city to city, but vet to vet as well.<br>  <br>  $2,500 does sound like a lot of money.  Perhaps a better option would be to amputate the leg?  Cats can get along fine on three legs.  And perhaps you should have thought about this before you let your cat free roam.  Cats that are kept safely indoors don't end up with broken legs.  Your cat "broke its leg"?  That's a bit odd.  I think the true comment should be "a car hit my cat and broke its leg".  Cat don't break their own legs.|`|5M2WT5oDaa	One of my cats got into a fight with another cat and he was bleeding and had a broken leg, the vet bill was $400 and yes he was worth it.|`|RmZxcT6Naa	About ï¿¡3.50|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	The estimate you got is probably good. You could call around to other hospitals to get estimates, but if the cat needs plates and such, it runs about that. <br>  I worked in a 24 hour emergency/routine animal hospital here in the US for 13 years. Fracture repair ran about that and more, depending on how severe the fracture was. I have seen it go higher. <br>  If you call around to other clinics, they will give you ballpark estimates, from lowest to highest. Since they have no access to x-rays, exam reports, etc..., they will estimate based on the basic costs of the surgery, and what the most expensive repair they have performed. <br>  Hope this helped, and good luck to your kitty.
nlRr07dRaa	First of all you shouldn't do 30-50% waterchanges, the water is never going to cycle, and you're only killing the cycle when you do a 50% waterchange. you should do a waterchange of only %15 every couple weeks. <br>  <br>  As for the food....when you initially defrost the bloodworms, i'd rinse them out too. ussually the water they come in is filthy for the fish tank. rinse them till the run off is clear. feed the fish only a couple blood worms at a time and make sure they are eating it. if it goes to the bottom fish it out. you don't want to take the chances and think he's going to eat it later, usually they dont. <br>  <br>  ... if you don't have a filter with carbon, carbon is really helpfull in clearing up the water... <br>  <br>  good luck!
a60QJhm9aa	Yeh they will be fine.|`|VPldzHUDaa	Yes, those fish are all ok to have together. They are "schooling fish", and since they are all peaceful fish, they should be just fine. They are great additions to a community tank and are a fine fish for beginners. The only concern is your "silver shark". While they are commonly sold in pet stores, they grow too large for a tank your size. They can reach 8"-24" when grown, and are not reccomended for aquariums under 800 liters. Good luck and have fun!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Bleeding hearts are schooling fish, requiring 5 or more, and again....silver sharks/bala sharks get too large for a 110 litre tank.
378b13982f38188afccdf2a26222cf1eaa	I am guessing it may be fecal impaction which is more common in older boars, but it is possible in females as well.<br>  It could also be she is consuming  too little food thus not producing as much stool.<br>  Another possibility is an intestinal blockage.<br>  I strongly urge you to take her to an exotics vet right away. I see it as an emergency and would take her right away.<br>  Since you mention there are lumps inside, I assume an impaction.<br>  If it is, the vet may be able to show you how to remove the stool from the anal sac.<br>  I believe once a guinea pig has had an issue with anal impaction, it is something that needs to monitored regularly.<br>  Please get her to the exotics vet as soon as possible.<br>  Good luck.|`|GZHS33n5aa	hi take to the vet you dont know what pain it is in.
hHHH9Snaaa	Um... i'm guessing no. <br>  but it all depends on what kind of turtle you have. <br>  <br>  like some of them will go eat anything they see. <br>  <br>  <br>  i have 2 red eared sliders and I've put an algae eater in there, and it never died. <br>  i just took it out one day to move it to another tank because it needed it more. <br>  <br>  For the most part, the algae eater was fast enough to swim away. So each of the two animals had their own little world in the tank and didn't really bother each other. <br>  <br>  so i will so no they probably won't attack the algae eater.|`|5ADpQYDSaa	depends what kind of tutle it is if its a lond necked tutle then no it wouldnt attack it it would probably just ignore it but otherwise im nt sure.|`|7aEuyKVxaa	depends what breed of algae eater you put in is it carnivorous'?

T1ffrjHAaa	I had the same trouble with Gourami's. In the end I just had to seperate the aggressive fish into a seperate tank. Not much more you can do.|`|Xl24JCTVaa	gouramis are kinda like betta they fight for territory so you might want to separate the aggrieves ones or buy a bigger tank|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	That's just how Gouramis are I'm afraid. The only things you can do is to either remove the bully or give them a big enough tank so that the territorial tendancies won't be a problem. It's not a matter of how many males or females either, the biggest will always claim the largest territory and if the tank's not big enough, the others may get killed. Good luck.
1bRRODd2aa	It could have the beginnings of air bladder disease.<br>  <br>  If you are surface feeding your fish, it may be taking in gulps of air with the food.  If it is ingesting air, then if it has a deteriorating air bladder, the air in the stomach will flip the fish until the air disperses through it's gut and out.|`|qFtH3lPBaa	its because its a greedy little sh;;; lol|`|3GjotXPXaa	he is either dying, being fed too much, or he is getting picked on by others.|`|p1gzHgAraa	trapped air. i would try feeding it sinking pellets-that way he cant gulp down air..|`|Qmrqifvcaa	Probably gulps down air as well as the food.<br>  <br>                                        Jim|`|Ka60wb1Vaa	coz you've over fed it.... why dont you google this question????|`|533a5167f48670c40d7fa2f2424703a3aa	I think your goldfish is really chilled out.

SOMETIMES they're ok if they are both really young females, but even females can be territorial. At the pet store where I work, we're constantly having to separate female russian dwarfs. I don't work with males at the store, yet I know that they are even more territorial.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	he will be fine on his own, mine has been on his own for nearly 3 years and he is fine.|`|vDINRJAfaa	I wouldn't do. They could probably fight if they hadn't been introduced at a young age. If it is still young you could try to introduce it to one slowly over time. It will be fine on his own as long as he gets lots of human attention and love from you.|`|v3dN1sSaaa	no i wouldn't recommended it because they are different ages wont be  related so they are likely to fight to the death so i wouldn't <br>  good luck <br>  hope i helped|`|cb79232e59dfc01fdbbc07b7723cf176aa	russian dwarf hamsters can be kept together if bought at the same time still young, but you cant keep syrian hamsters together they will fight to the death.
8owlj2xHaa	I believe those tanks come with just a normal florescent fixture. You will have to change the fixture to something else. You can not just add bulbs to that for more light. You need very strong light that will penetrate deep in to the water. A T-%  ho fixture would work well for that tank. <br>  Here is a link to some . <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marinedepot.com/ps_AquariumPage~PageAlias~lighting_fluorescent__subindex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marinedepot.com/ps_AquariumPa...</a>|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	jewel tanks have their own light systems so i think it would be hard to add to it.you can get the units they use but im not sure you would have room to fit it.
DU0F48B3aa	first I'm sorry for your loss<br>  however even thiough anesthesia is measured and the dog is observed carefully during and after surgery this sometimes happens.<br>  From what you wrote it wasn't how it was administered but the fact that your dog had a reaction to it. there is no way of knowing ahead of time that this will or would have happened.especially with a small dog their little bodies react so fast and sometimes drastically.<br>  I knew a nearly 200 pound person that  nearly died from an alergic reaction to anesthesia. this is just a one in I don't know how many but unfortunately again it does happen.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	My Vet recommends a blood test before anesthesia to evaluate this risk, it is optional, it costs money, and without it the risk to the animals life is a crap shoot. I always pay for the test, even at that there will still be risks, just as there are with human surgery.  Paying the pre-test minimizes that risk, but nothing eliminates the risk of anesthesia.|`|KZ30PZZvaa	That's just what happens sometimes I guess. Some dogs get little affected apposed to my dog who can be sick for a couple days. It was unfortunate it happened like that to your dog.<br>  <br>  But hey, maybe it was the vets fault, I obviously don't know.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	"Do"?<br>  Bury it.<br>  <br>  That reaction was VERY rare,unpredictable & nobodies "fault".<br>  No,you can't sue.|`|jxbNUjuWaa	oh my gosh :( that's so sad.<br>  I have no idea.. i just wanted to say i'm sorry that happened to your dog.|`|L4obbx3kaa	I don't know what amount is fatal. However the mortal rate of animals dying due to anesthesia is higher than in humans. <br>  Some dogs simply can't handle anesthesia, and then it wouldn't matter how great care your vet took, the surgery would most likely ended up in the death of the animal.<br>  Your Pomeranian may also have suffered from epilepsy, which is usually inherited but may not appear until the dog's older (10 month is a bit young).<br>  However, some Pomeranians' have idiopathic epilepsy, which means it's impossible to say what 'causes the seizure. In your case the anesthesia may have 'caused it. I'm so sorry for your loss but I guess if you really want to know why then get an autopsy for your dog. It's expensive, but if you think it's worth it..then go for it.|`|1NrlC1tOaa	Just get a different kind or dog that gonna make you happy|`|bIaywrBCaa	I am so sorry for your loss. There is always a slight risk with surgery of any kind even for humans. The biggest risk being reactions to anesthesia. It does happen on rare occasions. So sorry.
hKVOw1Sjaa	If you are going for this breed which by the way are  lovely but do suffer some major health issues choose a reputable registered breeder and NOT from the Newspaper  as they do not need to advertise their reputation will be well established both in the ring and in their breeding program.If in the States go to the AKC website and look up all the breeders in your area who breed cockers.The only way you can work out if they do the health testing is ask,visit and prepare a list of questions you want answered as they also will ask your situation.If in another Country go to your main official dog governing body and look up the breed you want.Get as much info about the breed re health training,family children etc before you buy as you cannot go to a Breeder empty handed|`|rLDf1gGGaa	If you buy a dog over the Internet, at a pet store or through a newspaper ad, your new pooch may very well be from a puppy millâa mass dog breeding operation.

F32uPjAraa	You have a very healthy eco - system in your pond. Leave them, your fish will enjoy the snack, and many will survive to become tadpoles, more food for your fish. If your lucky you will even have frogs to serenade you in spring.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Leave it be. We have loads of frogspawn in our pond, about 20 clumps. The fish eat most of it but judging by the 23 adult frogs that were in there the other day enough tadpoles survive to adulthood without any "help" from humans. <br>  <br>  The frogs lay so many eggs in the first place because of predation, its all part of the natural cycle.

If not just leave it. The fish will probably enjoy eating it and I doubt it would harm them.
Eg1G2mvVaa	I grew up with labs and lab crosses and we always had cats as well.  My parents always got the dogs as puppies (8-10 wks) and I found that by the time the puppy had outgrown the cat it already had the very clear (and permanent) idea that cats were to be loved but not to be messed with!  You will need to make sure that the cats will be OK with dogs, if they run at the sight of a dog it will make training harder.  Whilst I normally advise to get a shelter dog, in your case I would advise you to get a puppy the first time to make it easier on all of you (naturally, if you can find a lab puppy in a shelter I still advise that :-) ).|`|Ltx89w04aa	Depends.  If it's a puppy, it will grow up with your cats and be fine with them.  If it's an adult, it may need some training before it's good with your cats.<br>  <br>  If it's puppy, however, it WILL need trained as it concerns the cats.  Puppies don't always know when they're being too rough (just like kids), they have to be taught to play gently with people and the other household pets.  No dog is going to be born just loving cats and knowing how to act with them - they need guidance from their humans for that.|`|Cg5FJVd9aa	good choicee, but for the first 5 months or so you have to be near him/her 24/7, getting a dog, is not only a new begginng for you, its a new life for your dog, beside the fact you, yourself need to get used to hiim, as well as the dog getting used to you. im sure the lab will be greaat with cats! just ask your vet for total secure, butt im almostt certainn!<br>  hope i helpedd<br>  <br>  <br>  -kaylynn!!<br>  (bestt answeerr pleasee??)|`|n7GOiKC0aa	If a Lab has had plenty of exposure to other dogs, cats, and small animals, and has been trained how to interact with them, he'll be friendly with other pets, too.

XzXpDPpfaa	Have you tried putting trotting poles AFTER the jump?<br>  <br>  Either that, or you could put a double or triple (extra jumps should start at around 1ft.)<br>  <br>  She will have to change her pace drastically if she wants to jump the double.|`|x787hJbBaa	Try to put poles before and after the jump. I would do them at the canter spacing though because if she canters out she could trip and fall on trotting poles. My horse got it into his head last week to leave out his last stride, jump an 18 inch jump at 50 mph and canter out really fast. I put poles 10 feet before and 10 feet after the jump and he learned to jump it fine. We jumped a 2 foot one stride line that day.|`|jM7CyxQzaa	Please DON'T put poles after the jump!<br>  <br>  Firstly and mainly, it's dangerous, if she's running away in any case she's not going to take any notice of the poles.<br>  <br>  Secondly since she's presumably got her head up and is evading the bit there's a very real danger that she'll not see the poles and a horse can break a leg by stepping on a pole that rolls (or anything else that moves for that matter) she could come down and crush you, DON't do it please.<br>  <br>  Ok what I'd suggest you are not going to like<br>  <br>  Don't jump her - just forget about it for a while and take her out on some long hacks to enjoy life again. Let her forget for now about jumping, she's worried and things are not working out. Even if you've got her straight into the jump there's way more to it than bombing over it flat out.<br>  <br>  Here's what I suggest, after a rest - minimum six weeks or so - from jumping go back to basics.<br>  <br>  Do some good schooling, get professional help if necessary to sort out any underlying issues you have or your riding has (quite often things are down to bad riding and the horse getting the wrong signal) Make sure her tack fits ok, that's the other big bugbear of horses jumping, they're ok on the flat but over jumps something pinches and they get pain from it with the extra forces involved in taking off and landing.<br>  <br>  Once you're sure all that is fine, then work on getting her calm and collected in flat schooling, work on extension, collection, direction changes, work her hard and really get her listening, do lots of transitions but this is ONLY when she's calm on the flat. At this stage if you do say a walk to canter transition all you're going to teach her is that it's ok to 'take off' when you say 'go' to her, this is why the schooling is so necessary, you need to 'explain' to her via the schooling both what you want, and is acceptable and what you don't want and what is not acceptable.<br>  <br>  Get her balanced and moving forward, get her calm and accepting of the bit (try for ON the bit but don't - please - do this by pulling her head into position or falsely setting it with some kind of traning aid - do it by good riding, light hands, strong seat and 'reading' the mare to understand her)<br>  <br>  Once you're happy on the flat then introduce trotting poles again. Work her on a long line of them, get her trotting through calmly, then one stride from the end put up a crosspole, once she's doing the poles and the crosspole happily and what's more CALMLY - by this I mean approaching under control and not rushing, then landing and trotting happily away, you can put up another jump further on (two strides)<br>  <br>  This second jump is what will teach her to expect to jump a course not just one single obstacle - you could do this now but from what you've said I wouldnt' reccomend it as you need to sort her out from basics rather than trying to bodge what is already broken if you see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Once she's happy with the poles and a couple of jumps nothing gets them working better than a jumping lane (thats a row of jumps enclosed in a 'lane' of poles) The next stage of course is a course, build up the number slowly and if at any stage of this she rushes again then go back a stage until she's calm, A calm horse happy in her work is a lot nicer to see than one freting and getting overexcited when faced with poles.<br>  <br>  Edit - in that case go with building up the number of jumps and getting her to come down to trot between them. She can't rush if she has to think about the next jump, What tack do you have on her?

C1eHfhrHaa	The breeder you got the pup from should have all that information for the parents, so ask them first.  It might take a little research on your part, but if you have your 3 gen pedigree you may be able to search some of it yourself through the KC.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Get in touch with the owners of its parents if you can|`|UmhWxs1laa	If your dog is from a responsible breeder who breeds only dogs with OFA certifed hips, you can simply go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.offa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.offa.org/</a><br>  <br>  And search on your dog's breed, along with the sire and dam name.  They you can "tree backwards" from the sire and dam to see their parents, siblings, etc.<br>  <br>  Remember, this ONLY works if the dogs in your dog's pedigree have been OFA certified with their results in the database.<br>  <br>  Other ways include calling your breeder for a three generation pedigree (they certainly should have given you that when you bought your pup) and google dogs in the pedigree, and call the people who owned them.  I've done that to get info on dogs in Europe that weren't in the OFA database (there are other databases in the world if your dog or dog's relatives are from overseas...)<br>  <br>  I'm assuming PennHip also has a public database.  Not nearly as widely used as OFA, but you could also check there.<br>  <br>  In some breeds there are also "Sourcebooks" and "Publication of Titles" publications but you do need to buy these from the parent club and they'd be rather expensive.
i5zBmtqRaa	If you're getting a grown Boxer, a set schedule like that should be fine.  If you are planning on getting a puppy, I would wait until your summer break from school to get it.  Puppies can only hold their urine for 1 hour per month of age.  So if you get the puppy, you want to make sure that you are home most of the day to properly train it and reward it during potty training and obedience.  Also, make sure you research the boxer.  Know the common health hazards of the breed such as an increased risk of certain cancers (cardiomyopathy), as well as hip and knee problems.  One last advice:  when picking out your boxer, make sure that you ask to see both the father and mother, their papers, the living conditions.  You want to make sure that you are getting the dog from a responsible breeder and not promoting inbreeding.

4aAhEK9daa	Inbreeding.  Crooked or short tails are most often from a birth defect.  And with feral colonies of cats often having a small gene pool there's lots of inbreeding going on and hence, lots of birth defects.|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	My fatso was an out-door cat for a year before he came to me. He belonged to a pregnant stray cat that my neighbor brought in. In the year before he came to me, both he and his brother had some kind of fungus that affected their tails. Both tips were bent about 2 inches down (from tip of tail) and had a bald spot at the bend. They were treated for a fungal infection....and the ends of their tails fell off! The cat that chose me now  has a normal looking tail and doesn't seem to notice that he's lost an inch or two.
1i8HiHHeaa	you don't mention how old your dog is. if she's young it's possible she's experiencing a 'fear period' during which even things she's seen & been ok with before will suddenly startle or frighten her. <br>  <br>  is it possible one of the kids has hurt or teased or scared her? she may be reacting to a prior bad experience. <br>  <br>  or it may be possible that she is not feeling well. often when dogs are sick they are more prone to aggressive behavior, just like we get cranky when we get sick. <br>  <br>  at any rate & for whatever reason she's doing this you'll need to work her through this so she doesn't think this behavior is ok. in this situation her aggression is most likely to escalate. you need to do something NOW before she hurts someone. <br>  <br>  there are trainers all over & many will make home visits. i recommend finding an experienced trainer/behaviorist who uses positive methods exclusively to guide you through this difficult time. if you do nothing you'll be sorry.|`|AA11244754	You didn't say if she's been spayed or not.

Ask yourself. <br>  <br>  1) Do you walk your dog or does the dog walk you? <br>  2) Do you give her attention when SHE wants it ALL the time? <br>  <br>  1) if your dog walks you then that can lead her to believe she is the alpha. in a pack the leader goes first in walks so when you walk her you need to always be one step in front of your dog and if you stop don't call her. just give her a tug and start walking. pack leader don't call the others when they start going. they just go.and make sure you are calling all the shots on the walk. like where and when she can sniff around to go to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  2) If you give her the attention every time she wants it, like if she nudges your hand or arm and you pet her, then she believe she could get you to do what she wants. next time she does it just ignore it.<br>  <br>  hope I helped|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Ask your vet.<br>  Ask your vet [again] to see if there actually are any obedience schools [I know you said there aren't any but ask anyway, there might be one]<br>  Whenever your dog barks or attack, say 'NO' very firmly.

GSWvBUJiaa	My cockatiel won't really eat fruit or veggies either. However I can suggest a couple of things to try.<br>  <br>  First of all are you feeding her seed or pellets? As i'm sure you already know, seeds are high in fat and pellets are much better for them. Seed is like lollies or fast food for birds. If you offer them seed with their fruit or veggies they will most likely choose their "junk food" over their greens. Try offering these types of foods at different times. In the morning give her her fruit and veggies (such as peas, corn, broccoli etc) and then at night take out the leftovers and replace with pellets (you can still give her some seed though, about a teaspoon with her pellets is good). That way during the day she doesn't have a choice to eat anything other than her greens.<br>  <br>  Birds can be quite picky. You need to offer her many different types of fruit and veggies to see what she likes the best. Cockatiels aren't really big veggie eaters any way. Just remember not to give her onion or avacado as these are dangerous for birds.<br>  <br>  You can also try giving her soaked seed (look up on the internet on how to do this) or simply plant some bird seed in the garden, and then give her the sprouts that grow out of it. They also like millet, which you can get from the pet shop.<br>  <br>  If everything else fails and she still isn't interested in eating her fresh greens, there are special cockatiel mixes of food which you can buy from the pet shop which contain pellets, seed and tiny pieces of dried fruit and veggies. I buy this for my cockatiel and he eats it all. There is a whole range of different packs for different types of birds, for example the macaw mix contains big chunky pieces of dried fruit and whole nuts.<br>  <br>  hope this helps, good luck.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-We have had out tiel for 6 years, and he has never eaten anything but his pellets and some millet on his play pen.  We have him on the tan pellets in his cage, and colored pellets on the play-pen.  He seems to think the colored is a treat?  We have tried every fruit/veggie known, and he just does not even try them.  I have even tried giving him some as I wwas eating- same negative result.  Some just don;t like to try new things.|`|dO0cb4yBaa	Be careful with vitamins and vitamin water. Too many vitamins can create problems just like too few vitamins. That's why it's important to provide a balanced diet. I've included a couple links below that may help you come up with some ideas for getting your Cockatiel to try new foods. The bottom line is that it takes a lot of patience, a lot of attempts and a lot of different foods to find what your bird likes. Good luck :)|`|VdeV0jUqaa	The best way I have of introducing new food to my parrots is to eat it in front of them. If you have a strong enough bond with your bird, you should notice that it will start to eat when you are eating- and they are usually intensley interested in what you have to eat.<br>  Next time you are eating something, eat it near your bird- you might even like to have her out of her cage and near the food so she can have a try if she likes.<br>  Parrots can eat pretty much everything except for avocado, chocolate, etc. A little bit of your dinner shouldnt hurt her at all, provided that its not full of salt or sugar.<br>  My birds love to have a bite of my toast, or a piece of my cereal each morning, and they love to drink my juice as well!<br>  Once you have started introducing new foods to her she should be more accepting of the fresh foods that you are giving her.|`|mZNSgvBUaa	There is a company called Just Tomatoes. It puts out freeze dried fruits and vegatables.I give my cockatiels the red rasberries and corn and they love it as it is crunchy. There is absolutely no sugar or preservatives of any kind, so its healthy for them. Plus you can leave it in the cage without worrying it will spoil. You can check them out online, or some of the health food stores carry this line.Its made for people and pretty tasty I must say. Good Luck!|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	How are you serving it to her? Does she have a treat dish...I like to fool mine and but veggies in there...haha it actually works! Also, is the food cut up really small? If I don't cut it up he get really scared of it and will run from it, but if I cut it into small pieces he will eat it all.|`|cQQXbY0Jaa	shes probably a seed junky which isnt good because they are high in fat<br>  <br>  what can i say its like going from chesseburgers with lots of cheese to carrots. try cutting back on the seeds and slowly start adding more healthy foods. she will get hungry sooner or later and start eating the fruits. good luck
hetZz4c1aa	I think it would a kindness and best for all for you to find a good, loving home for the kitten.  Your son is simply too young at this time.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	In this case, it probably is best to rehome the kitten and start working on a little more control of your son.<br>  <br>  My son grew up with kittens/cats in the house and he was taught from the time he was crawling you don't hurt the kitties...he is very gentle with cats and knows how to handle them.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	This is the reason that a good numbers of rescues and shelters (and breeders as well) will not adopt a kitten out to homes with children under 5.  We have seen a large number of cats in our rescue who now unfortunately cannot be placed in homes with children as they have learned to hate and fear them.  It's time to find a new home for the kitten, and soon - right now there aren't many kittens in shelters, but soon there will be.  The kitten's got an excellent chance at being adopted now, but much less a month or so from now.<br>  <br>  There is a parenting issue going on as well - at 2 1/2 your son's no young toddler who's incapable of understanding or self control.  If after his 'punishment' he continues to do what he's been punished for, then the punishment isn't severe enough to deter him from what he's doing.  But this is the cat answers, not parenting answers, so I'll get off my soapbox.  My daugher was raised with cats and kittens (rescues and our own) and we only ever had one issue.  One and only one.  <br>  <br>  Do rehome the kitten, and no more pets until your son is under control.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	I am afraid that this is why animal shelters are very reluctant to rehome cats/kittens to a family where there are very young children.  It certainly seems as if your kitten is unhappy and unless you can stop your son's behaviour immediately, the situation is likely to get worse (peeing/pooing/spraying inappropriately).  <br>  <br>  If you can keep your kitten away from your son and cats who are attacking him then you might be able to calm him (you could try Feliway Artificial Pheromone Diffusers which will help with this) but if this is impossible then unfortunately the best thing you can do for your kitten is to find it a new loving home.<br>  <br>  Its very sad but you are right to consider the kitten in this situation.|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	You can't stop your son from harassing the cat? The child gets in trouble and takes it out on the animal. The animal doesn't take kindly to that and your suggestion is to get rid of the animal?  HUH??<br>  <br>   Teach your child how to treat both people and animals. If you're using the cat as an out, it shouldn't be there in the first place.

uoOfkE7Aaa	Not to be rude but if you "found out" she was pregnant that means it was not a planned breeding, that's an irresponsible dog owner. It's great that you got advice from a vet, however there is a lot that goes into being a breeder and many things that you obviously didn't know needed to be done. There are a million reasons the pups could have died and if you were a resposible breeder you would have known what to do to prevent many of  them, starting with your dog not just getting pregnant out of nowhere. Please spay your dog ASAP.|`|UmhWxs1laa	Why did the puppies die...<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry, but having puppies is so way more than just letting the mom care for them.<br>  <br>  When we have planned litters from our champion show dogs, I take off 3 weeks from work.  We stay up in shifts waiting for the dog to give birth (or rush to the reproductive vet for a c-section).<br>  <br>  When the pups come home, we keep them in a whelping box (with a pig rail so mom won't inadvertantly crush them), have an x-pen around it draped with a sheet, a special puppy warming pad (not a heating pad) on one end of the box, along with a gentle heat lamp.  We also have a humidifier going 24/7 and keep the room at a constant 72 degrees F.<br>  <br>  Pups are weighted with a digital kitchen scale twice a day -- every day and their weights monitored.  If a pup is not gaining weight we watch him carefully and supplement with "stat" or tube feed a bit.  If he doesn't gain weight for 24 hours, off to a vet experienced in neonatal care (not all are!!!).  We know how to tube feed (not bottle feed -- that's dangerous!) and give sub-q fluids for a pup getting dehydrated.  We also listen to the pups' lungs at each weighing to ensure no respriatory infections have occured.  <br>  <br>  Pups can die very quickly -- "fading puppy" is very common and the pup just stops eating and dies in a matter of a day or two.  <br>  <br>  Constant care -- that means someone monitoring and watching for 3 weeks- yes even sleeping next to the whelping box -- is how responsible breeders do not lose puppies that could otherwise have lived.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you are a good pet owner.  What you are not prepared to be is a responsible breeder - not many people are.  Please spay your girl to ensure this never happens again.|`|9kTejB0uaa	This is such a chapter of mixed messages (eg 'responsible' and 'just found out she was pregnant' ??!!) that's it's truly hard to know how to answer this question.<br>  <br>  Suffice to say as you've had such a hard time, I'm sure you will be getting your b itch spayed.<br>  <br>  And as for the puppy mortality rate being higher in purebred dogs ..... RUBBISH!!!!!|`|AA12249811	I agree with all the others. There could have been a lot of reasons the pups died, but responsible pet owners spay their pets if they're not THE HIGHEST quality and purposefully bred to THE HIGHEST quality. <br>  <br>  We also don't know what she bred with, and the health of that dog. Just like some women can't carry babies to term and give birth to healthy babies, dogs are the same. Maybe fate says she can't have healthy babies.<br>  Before you, and your little spitz girl, go through this sad ordeal again...please get her spayed.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	If you "found out" she was pregnant, it means you did not plan the breeding, so you are very irresponsibe.  The most responsible thing would be to get her spayed so this doesn't happen again.  Without having a necropsy done on the pups you won't know what killed them- it could be a virus or a genetic problem.  Either way the b**** should not be bred again.|`|DU0F48B3aa	without a necropsy ( autopsy) there is no way to know<br>  are you sure they were full term and not preemies<br>  did mom produce enough milk<br>  did mom by any chance have worms that may have effected the pups<br>  did she lay or step on them causing damage and killing them ( often done with a new mom not on purpose but does happen)<br>  Maybe for some reason they weren't developed enough. <br>  so many possibilities and sorry but this does happen
uoOfkE7Aaa	Best advice, go with a breeder who breeds pugs. Not has a mutt litter. There is no way to tell what they will end up like. They could look like their mom and then sprout up and be tall like their dad. Why would support a BYB anyway? Find a reputable breeder and get a pup from them.|`|Bw18seFqaa	there's no guarantee on size.  It doesnt matter which parent the pup looks most like...  ant of the pups could be the size of the pug, or the boxer, or any size inbetween.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	OK- I would be surprised if the mom and pups survive.  Usually there are huge issues with such a different size when the mom is smaller.  With mixes it is impossible to tell what size the pups will be as adults, especially when a boxer is significantly larger than a pug.  The pups could end up anywhere in between when they are grown.  Choose the one of the smaller pups nd they might (I stress MIGHT) be smaller when they are grown. If you want a pug, then get a pug from a reputable breeder or from a rescue.  then you know what you are getting.|`|AA12249811	I have to agree with the other poster...if you want something that looks like a pug, and acts like a pug, get a pug. <br>  These designer mutt breeders will tell you that you get the 'best of both breeds' but until they have been breeding for many generations and have developed a standard (thus a new purebred), you could get the worst of BOTH breeds. You could end up with a puppy that has the heart and eye diseases of the boxer, AND the breathing problems of the pug.<br>  Check out <a href="http://www.pugrescue.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pugrescue.com/</a> and <a href="http://petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://petfinder.com</a> and see if you don't fall in love with a pug who looks like a pug first.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	They can only "look like" the disastrous mongrels they are.<br>  And....mutt-makers will LIE too.|`|nFcl0BOsaa	If you are set on getting one of these pups, about all you can do is try to see which of the mutt puppies take after the mom. But I hope you are not paying money to the irresponsible owner. Good lord.  Did the pug survive carrying pups for a Boxer?? Make sure and have your pup spayed/neutered.<br>  <br>  Add:  I don't think anyone in his right mind would pick one that looks like the dad if they prefer it take after the mom. But you can't be sure, it's strictly a guess. <br>  <br>  "And even if the litter parents are known, if they are two widely divergent breeds or mixes in size, coat, or temperament, it will be difficult to determine which pups will take after Mom, which ones will resemble Dad, which ones will look and act like a little bit of both, and which ones will look and act like neither parent."wwwcanismajor.com/dog/mixed
CTGdx76gaa	It could be parasites. I've heard that fish with spots like that have parasites. It is confusing though, it really sounds like you made sure the water for the transfer was safe and the tanks were clean, so I have no idea on how he could have gotten it. The pet shop man might me partly right, but I do think that he could also have this. The other possibility is ammonia burns. My sister's fish got burns to it's stomach, and it made him look like he had brownish spots. Basically it means that your fish is suffering from high ammonia, and that you should find some drops to lower the ammonia. To treat parasites, you can give it special medicine. Sorry I couldn't help more!|`|grJG2c8jaa	Could it be possible that it is just getting its adult colouring?<br>  I have seen these before and they are usually a brown colour so it could just be getting older.<br>  If it isnt this then it could be ammonia burns. Other than that, it dosen't look like anything i've seen or heard about before.<br>  Good Luck with your fish :)|`|kklh2A8baa	to be on the safe side i would take fish out and repeat the process or just keep out of that tank for a few weeks an see if this improves his condition|`|NOUluYJ3aa	i have some of these algae eaters and mine is the same as yours he has been in the same tank all the time his colour changes as he gets older/bigger is he in trop tank or cold  water?i think it is normal and if the fish is happy and eating o.k i wouldn't worry
LywVUxsTaa	In shelters, the ones most often adopted out are small, cute dogs.  The larger, "scarier" looking dogs are less desirable.  People generally do not go there with a specific breed in mind, or if they do they are open to other dogs that may resemble a breed they like, since there are so many mixed breeds in shelters. <br>  <br>  Also, calmer dogs tend to get more attention because people are not attracted to wild, over-energized dogs, which is kind of unfair, because being kept in a small dog run all day like that will make any dog stressed and unable to release that energy.  They also get excited by all the other dogs barking.  Sometimes the dogs that seem like they would be crazy to live with will calm down considerably after you get them out of that environment.|`|Cg5FJVd9aa	it doesnt go by most popular, everyone is diffrent, they go by wich needs more or less attention, wich breed needs exercise? its not by cuteness... everyone has a diffrent lifestyle, and needs. it doesnt go bye popularity. what people want, is what people get, and everyone is diffrent, so what they want is diffrent.<br>  hope i helpedd<br>  <br>  -kaylynn<br>  (best answerr pleasee??)|`|xkRA3APtaa	Personally, as the owner of a black labrador, i think they are the best dogs.

I see those a lot.|`|uDFb1UbXaa	at the shelter dogs that would be adopted out most are light coloured puppies and labrador type dogs, younger dogs etc. For some reason darker dogs are harder to rehome and older ones to, cos everyone wants a puppy.

Black dogs, unfortunately, are the most euthed of all, beause people think black animals are bad luck.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	As most crossbreeds unfortunately end up in shelters than the most often adopted "type" would be a crossbreed.|`|7GQuGVzmaa	well i will say labs and golden retrievers im getting a lab i think its coz they are family dogs
AA11887983	Cats are pretty good a defense, even with no claws.  But yeah, it does cut down on their ability to use them.  They may not be as able to climb a tree or things like that.  So just make sure that she isn't able to get outside.|`|AMvR4u2Taa	Only put them on her front paws and you should be ok. That way if somehow she gets out she can defend herself with her back claws.|`|xa2emZNfaa	Yes it would be more difficult for you cat to defend her self when she was out side. But she would still be able to with her teeth and try with her claw too but as i said she won't be really safe outside. don't you love smart Intelligent cats lol
tY14vbrKaa	It's very normal.  When a fully mature adult male is neutered, what's left often resembles an empty sac.  Sometimes they're so swollen, sometimes it appears that no neuter has been done at all.  It will reduce in size as time passes.|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Not a dumb question at all -- very normal.  And yes, it's quite normal  The sac will shrink and disappear over time.  <br>  <br>  Hey, I had a male dog neutered years ago and I about had a heart attack when he managed a tie with my intact female (show dog).  I thought maybe the vet had missed something!  A quick phone call to a breeder friend of mind assured me that this does happen sometimes, even with neutered males, although obviously they can't sire puppies! :-)|`|jNPCT96Xaa	We have a male dog who was fixed as a puppy and still has an empty sack. Its going to stay that way pretty much for the rest of his life. Having a dog fixed in my opinion doesnt change a lot of their behaviorial problems, that can be done with training. it just ensures a dog with behaviorial problems doesnt help to create more dogs with problems. But you did do his health justice. His chances of prostate problems and other cancers are now dramatically reduced.|`|oChOlCqYaa	Westley was neutered at 12 weeks, and now at 3 1/2 years still has a little extra skin there. I'd say it's normal. They just remove the testicles, they don't do anything with the skin of the scrotum. |`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	Don't worry, your dog is still swollen from surgery.  His "coin purse" will "deflate" over the next few days.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	the sac should shrink up over time.  completely normal.|`|moIPv7pFaa	It should shrink eventually. That's what happened with my dog.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	It will likely shrink to some extent, maybe not all the way, it depends.  When an older dog is neutered, the skin has been dragged into that larger shape for an extended period of time, so tends to stay stretched out for a while.  Over time, it will begin to shrink, usually only leaving a small sac leftover.  The speed at which that happens depends on the elasticity of your specific dog's skin.  |`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Your veterinarian could have also performed a procedure called an "ablation" to remove that excess skin.  But it is not routinely done and there would have been an additional charge.  But when older dogs are neutered it is normal for them to have a little "coinpurse" down there!  It may shrink some, but he will probably always have a little something left behind!|`|lXTlZFHPaa	yep yep mine has the same. he was 6 months when he had it done and I was a little confused that they'd left the 'extra skin' but it doesn't affect him at all. I wouldn't worry about it but I'm sure if you have any queries your vet (if he's a good vet) will have no problem explaining why this is done.|`|pWjwqvoSaa	Its probably just swelling and nothing to worry about.<br>  Just make sure he doesn't get at it.  Watch for excessive redness and stuff of that sort.<br>  <br>  If you see anything that has you worried you can call your vet for reassuance.<br>  <br>  |`|XyJHCXslaa	Don't worry, the sac will shrink in time.

jA1nfMeyaa	It's true that there SHOULD NOT be any difference between the two, but the fact is that THERE ARE obvious differences between the two types.  The fact is that those characteristics that make a dog so successful in the field aren't going to bode well at all in the ring.  The same characteristics that makes a dog successful in the ring are going to give it a disadvantage in the field.<br>  <br>  I've owned 2 field-bred English Cockers, and 1 show line English Cocker.<br>  <br>  Field-Bred and Show Cockers are very different physically. The Field-Bred will be taller, have a longer body, and a longer muzzle. The ears will be higher set on the skull while show lines will have the ears set at or below eye level. The will also have less feathering, which could get snagged in thick brush. Field-bred will also have tight eyes that show no haw. The docked tail of a field-bred is longer than the docked tail of a show line Cocker (you want the tail to be longer so that it can serve as a "flag" while out in the fields). <br>  <br>  Field Bred:<br>  <a href="http://www.spanielsinthefield.com/images/oct2006-dog.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.spanielsinthefield.com/images...</a><br>  <br>  Show:<br>  <a href="http://www.gotpetsonline.com/pictures-gallery/dog-pictures-breeders-puppies-rescue/english-cocker-spaniel-pictures-breeders-puppies-rescue/pictures/english-cocker-spaniel-0001.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotpetsonline.com/pictures-ga...</a><br>  <br>  I did work my show line Cocker, but she was not as successful in the field as the Field-bred Cockers. The Field-bred look the way they do, because those physical differences are all advantageous out on the field. The show-line had to be groomed far more frequently than the field types. His ears were always getting in the way and a few times he got eye infections, because things would get caught inside his big round eyes.  The higher set ears and tight eyes of the field type prevent all this from happening.  The show Cocker was also quite slow.  It worked at the pace of a Field Spaniel, which is okay, but not appropriate for his breed.  <br>  <br>  Besides being slightly "handicapped" by some of her physical traits, my show line Cocker didn't have as much of a drive as my field-bred, which makes ALL the difference.|`|AA11569882	We have one of each (and they are completely different in looks) the working cocker has a flatter head, she's slightly smaller, and her coat is a little shorter.  <br>  <br>  The working cocker does work, she goes after rabbits mainly.  But the show doesn't, it's just when we got her (they're both rescue) they told us she was a show cocker, same with the working one.  So it's like their breeds.  I read somewhere that show cockers are like American, and the working are English.  But I'm not sure about that.<br>  <br>  That chap above has a Springer Spaniel in the pic, completely different!|`|P3vZh1ajaa	they can both work...although the WORKING type look more like a chunky springer, and are most commonly black, liver or liver roan as they are prefered colours.<br>  they are a larger and more solid dog without thew feathering of a show type.<br>  working...<a href="http://www.bordercreek.co.uk/PHOTOS/FernDa1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bordercreek.co.uk/PHOTOS/Fern...</a><br>  show.....<a href="http://www.cockerspanielclubofscotland.co.uk/images/SH_CH_WILJANA_WATERFALL_CLAIRE.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockerspanielclubofscotland.c...</a><br>  <br>  there is also a breed called  the FIELD SPANIEL...<a href="http://www.killaraspaniels.com/images/Field%20Spaniels%202.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.killaraspaniels.com/images/Fi...</a> they are a recognised breed by the kennel club, but by everyday folk are often confused with cockers.<br>  <br>  same thing with springers here...<a href="http://www.kayndee.com/images/connor/connor1.jpg..show" rel="nofollow">http://www.kayndee.com/images/connor/con...</a> springer spaniel<br>  and working...<a href="http://www.dogbehavioronline.com/assets/springer_spaniel.jpg." rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbehavioronline.com/assets/...</a><br>  <br>  please note in both these breeds both types are functional as a working dog...see old books of cockers working in field look more like the show type.<br>  spaniels are the best breeds in the world to me, i could never be without A breed of spaniel, growing up it was cockers, now Cavaliers, but i have my eye on the Field for my next breed, or sussex spaniel|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	Some of the working types of American cockers look more like English cockers.spaniels.  The stand on more leg making them taller, they have less hair, and the bone structure is finer.  The muzzle is usually longer, and the eyes don't protrude as much. They are bred to cover ground in search of birds.  <br>  <br>  There is a difference in working lines compared to show lines in most hunting breeds.  The show dogs are bred towards a standard but it is a written standard that can be interpreted many different ways.  What exactly is "moderate coat"?  Does the coat cover the ground as in show American cockers or is the coat just a few feathers which are found on the back of the legs, underbelly and ears?|`|uDFb1UbXaa	yeah there SHOULD be none but there is, show types are generally for appearance and cosmetic look rather then actual purpose which can have worse effects on health. working dogs will be bred less for appearance and more for purpose which can lead to maybe a smaller or bigger dog but maybe more healthier.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	There should be *NONE*!<br>  Quality dogs fit their breed standard-whatever their job.|`|LywVUxsTaa	A pet or working cocker spaniel does not need to have a perfect build or coat.  Also, a pet is commonly kept in a shorter, easier to manage clip than a show cocker.  A show clip takes a lot of grooming and regular brushing to keep it clean and healthy and tangle-free.  With a pet you can keep the hair clipped short all over to keep it cleaner and easier to manage.|`|IcYXQlf9aa	show cockers are generally a little shorter, with a shorter muzzle and domed backsull  and A LOT more coat.

la9zji2Uaa	I think maybe keep bathing it in water with a little salt but he might want to be on his own. Some cats are funny when they are ill or feeling hurt.

If the paw is still bleeding (a little) and you don't want blood all over the house, then you can put him in a cat crate to wait somewhere quiet. He will be fine for a couple of hours.<br>  <br>  If the claw is totally gone, then the only treatment the vet might do is to apply a single stitch to close the sheath.  If the claw is broken, then he may seal the claw shut with heat. Both can be done under sedation.|`|AJXyQa17aa	Don't do anything - as the vet may want to operate on your cat. I know it will be awful to see your cat in pain (I was facing the same problem earlier today) but you mustn't feed him as it may take longer as the vet may need to wait for him to digest his food before he can be put under anesthetic. <br>  <br>  Offer your cat water if he's looking thirsty - but to keep him physically comfortable I would sit him on a comfortable blanket away from anything stressful (eg: radio/television/annoying siblings). <br>  <br>  Keep a close eye on him - best of luck with your cat!!|`|3AXlgGgUaa	I think you are better off leaving him in peace.<br>  <br>  Put him in a nice warm, dark, quiet room and let him sit it out until you can take him to the vet.<br>  <br>  Offer him lots of water, but don't let him eat incase the vet wants to operate on him.<br>  <br>  Don't wrestle with him to administer any home remedies...|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	Every couple hour put some peroxide on it to eliminate as many germs as possible till you can get him to vet.

Let him ride on your shoulder.  Even if he doesn't want you to pick him up, pick him up anyway and handle him.  In time he will find out you aren't going to hurt him.<br>  I suspect that your remark about his being "wild" is fairly accurate.  I remember the days when pet rats were always docile and easy to get along with.  Most of them still are.  But since so many rats are now sold as snake food, breeders have become careless about temperament.  Some rats show their ancestral wild traits.  Pet rats usually have no fear except what they learn from experience.  Wild rats of the same species, however are instinctively scared of larger animals (like people) and of being picked up.  <br>  But it sounds like yours is docile enough that you could convince it to like being handled.|`|Jf83ekK1aa	just keep handling him even if he doesn't like it, he will soon realise that you ain't gonna hurt him and will start to enjoy your attention, it might take sometime but be patient! x

gPkb49ldaa	When ever you are trying to change your hamsters food brand, you have to do it very gradually. Each time you feed it add a little more of the new food brand to the original brand. Your hamster should adapt to the new type of food. It might be hard on your hamster if you switch the food type on and off during the month though unless you switch slowly. I wouldn't worry too much about your hamster choking on anything, they know how to handle large pieces of food.<br>  <br>  hope that helped!
KkEqBDV2aa	What you should do is take it outside when it wakes up from naps,  every time after it eats and/or drinks, before you go to sleep at night and once you wake up in the morning. Keep doing that and it will soon learn that outside means going to the bathroom and it'll learn that schedule as well. The idea is to take it outside often, especially after something that will make it go to the bathroom like eating or drinking, since puppies go to the bathroom a lot.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  Here are some tips, use what helps,  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like âtsstâ and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they donât know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you donât want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying âgo finishâ until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesnât sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Train him just as any other breed.  If your older dog is fouling inside it will make it harder to train a new puppy.<br>  <br>  However:<br>  <br>  While you are training him, crate him at night, but make sure in the day you take him outside often, as soon as he wakes up, every time he has been fed, and at least every 2 hyours in-between. Watch him for signs he wants to pee and as soon as you see them., take him outside.<br>  <br>  Stay with outside, with a chosen word, like "hurry up" and when he has performed in the right place, lots of praise and play before you bring him back inside.<br>  <br>  If you can, and it's warm enough, and you have a safe, secure yard, leave a door open when you are in so he can learn to go outside when he needs to.<br>  <br>  If you follow this routine consistently, he will be housetrained very soon.<br>  <br>  ADDED: It is better to take him outside rather than put him on paper, otherwise you will then have to retrain him to go outside instead of using paper. Paper down is ok for accidents and during the night, but try to teach him to go out.|`|M2M14eCjaa	You can get excellent tips on how to house train your dog with the article link below, i have a poodle and he is just adorable and i tell you , i got all i needed to get him trained here<a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1506410/how_to_house_train_your_dog_and_achieve.html?cat=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Most puppies do not have full bladder or bowel control until they're around six months old.

meMF69tXaa	I don't use pine or cedar shavings with my rabbits. It is a known fact that the chemicals used to treat the wood will cause resp. problems, liver problems and kidney damage in rabbits. I used to not believe this until I started volunteering at the local vet's office. We had liver enzymes that would come back abnormal on rabbits that were using pine/cedar bedding. There were several deaths in rabbits who were kept in a cage with this type of bedding. Two of which I can recall that had total kidney failure.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to scare you about this. I just want to educate those who are not aware that this type of bedding can be dangerous to rabbits.<br>  As far as humans go, it's your choice whether to use this type of bedding with your rabbits or not.<br>  <br>  I use Care Fresh bedding.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|Xx7WwVXRaa	i've never heard that in my life...you can replace them with newspaper (you can buy it in stores) or paper based litter. wood based causes respiratory problems in small animals anyway.|`|L9gwgpIQaa	There are certain parasites that can be carried in fecal matter that could hurt the baby.

pk8Oemycaa	Here's my opinion...<br>  You had an animal, and she died. Weather it be from lack of nutrition, lack of attention, cancer or a tumor, she died. You said yourself that you never paid attention to her becasue "she was very annoying." So perharps she didn't die of a tumor. How do you know for sure that's what she died from. What if she died becasue you didn't feed her. Or becasue she got sores on her body becasue she had no physical activity to take part in. If you didn't pay attention to her when she was alive, I'm sure you wouldn't take a dead hampster to the vet to see why she died. So you guessing it was a tumor. <br>  I think that maybe you should get a second chance if you have matured and come to realization that animals are real and are not a toy. Animals are like little people. They realy on you to take care of them. You can't leave them alone becasue they're annoying. Imagine your mom not paying any attention to you, not playing with you, or raising you becasue you were "annoying." Chances are you would have died too. No matter what the size of the animal is, it's your responsibility to take care of them.<br>  If you can be mature and treat your animal like it needs to be treated then yes, you do deserve another chance. <br>  But if your going to feel the same towards your next animal, then no, and spare the animal it's life to a family that will love it.|`|Rfj2ULibaa	You are two years older, seems like you should be more mature at this point.  What are you doing to show your mom that you are responsible enough to care for another pet?  Do you keep your room clean without being told?  Do you help with the housework without being asked?  Have you done research into the kind of pet you want to get so that you know exactly what you will be getting into...<br>  <br>  I'm not your mom so I can't answer these questions, but they are the kind of things I would be looking at in deciding if my child was responsible enough for another pet.  (BTW, I recently bought my daughter a hamster for her 8th bday because she did some of these things at an age appropriate level)|`|dXn8JaZjaa	you don't say how old you are, but you've had a second chance and you blew it.|`|fSn4KSuPaa	i dont think so. you have to prove yourself. and you blew that|`|USeB6IQwaa	Yes of course you should get another chance if you promise to pay attention to it.<br>  hope i helped <br>  ?Juliet?|`|qjKsZbuuaa	Maybe you should try something else first, like a fish. I had to start out with fish. Once my parents saw that I could take care of them, they told me once they had all died (I had a ten gallon fish tank) I could get a rodent, I wanted a rat, but that does not change whether or not you should get a hamster or not. Fish are easier to take care of and you will be able to get different pets in the long run once you mom decides that you are ready to have another hamster.|`|knFrwCxcaa	Yes i do if you defo look after it|`|nOmX8XGUaa	just try with something easy like mice who are quite easy then if your mom sees that going well, after mice (when their time has come) try with a hamster

bPZj1El8aa	There are special nail clippers for hamsters, but normal ones should do just fine.<br>  <br>  Either hold him sturdy in your lap, or lift him up by the scruff of his neck. Cut the nails in the light, because rodents have blood vessels in their nail. It should appear to be a light pink/red line, and be careful because if you cut too far into the nail and into the blood vessel -- It will hurt your pet!<br>  <br>  Hamster's nails honestly do not need to be cut that often at all, though. It is a good idea to give him bars to scratch and bite on in the cage.|`|nzgZR6onaa	The new pet paws little motor powered that keeps you from making to close a cut and hitting the sensitive blood vessels.

It often hurts them because the nails are so small and it's incredibly easy to cut into the quick (the darker sensitive part of the nail) and cause bleeding or even the pressure (if you're using clippers) can hurt. I find it's best not to attempt to clip small rodents nails at all but rather put something rough like a brick in their cage in a place they walk on alot like near food dishes and that wears down their nails a bit.<br>  <br>     I've never had hamsters before but if you really want to clip their nails, here's what I've done with my pet rats a few times:<br>  I don't use clippers since those tend to make my rats squeak and really hurts with the pressure so I use this nail sanding tool called "Peti Paws" that can be found at petstores like Petsmart. It's more for cats and dogs but you can carefully put the rodent toes into the hole and steadily hold the feet still to get the nails. If you can't get this tool then you can take a regular nail file to file down the nails but it might take a bit longer and be a bit more difficult. My little rats squiggle around alot and are pretty hard to keep still by myself so I have someone else hold their body while I grab a leg and carefully file each toe down but only enough to take the sharp edge off. Absolutely DO NOT go into the darker part of the nail, this will cause them to bleed. I really only do the back feet if they really need to be cut down because those are the ones that they usually dig into stuff with and cause the most scratching. <br>  <br>     I've heard that hamsters can be real agressive and bite so if someone is helping hold the little guy, they should most likely wear some thick gloves and try to grasp it in a way that keeps their fingers out of reach of their nipping teeth. <br>  <br>     I hope this helps a bit. Like I said, I usually don't clip nails at all. Wearing clothing or a blanket that covers your skin will protect it from getting scratched if you let your lil' fuzzy friend wander around on you. Keeping your movements slow and gentle when he's on you will also help because if you make sharp, sudden movements, he'll dig in his claws to try to keep from sliding off.<br>  <br>    I just think minor scratches are a normal occurance that just comes up anyways from handling rodets. I usually find a couple around my neck once in a while but I don't even notice until I see em' in the mirror XD

If it's pointed, it's a male.  If it's fanned out, it's a female.<br>  <br>  For other fish such as goldfish, it's a little harder.  Each fish is different.

I would recommend that you buy a small animal like a gecko to show them that you are responsible and will take good care of any animal.  After a couple of months, I'm sure they will buy the ball python for you.

They will cause the same allergy symptoms as a fully haired cat. The only cat that comes close to being hypoallergenic is the Devon Rex.

Yep my dog dreams all the time, she barks while she's asleep.<br>  <br>  (Update)What scientist found:<br>  Do dogs and cats dream?<br>  <br>  Dogs have been found to experience periods of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. REM sleep in humans is associated with dreaming. Therefore, it is assumed that dogs dream. Similar to humans, dogs that are in REM sleep exhibit eyeball and lip movements, twitching of the extremities, and vocalizations.<br>  <br>  Sleeping cats have been studied with electroencephalograms (EEG), which read their brain activity. Cats were found to be in REM sleep or deep sleep for 30 percent of their sleeping time. The REM sleep or deep sleep periods were accompanied by changes in body posture, paw and claw movements, whisker twitching, ear flicking, and, in some cases, vocalization. It is therefore assumed that cats dream or at least have semiconscious experiences that are similar to human dreams.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	FACTS don't require "belief".|`|z6pKpasiaa	Probably Haah.

aeonmRR2aa	Never use hot tap water, only cold - hot water from the tap contains more heavy metals like copper.  That said...<br>  <br>  Put the new water into a bucket.  Add dechlorinator.  Let it sit for an hour or two to reach room temp.  Then chose one of...<br>  <br>  1)  Best solution:  Buy a second heater and thermometer.  Put them in the bucket.<br>  <br>  2)  Move the heater from the tank to the bucket for a while.  The tank shouldn't cool by more than a degree in that time.<br>  <br>  3)  Don't worry about it.  If the room is 70, and the tank is 76, a 25% water change will drop the tank temp to 74.5 which won't bother a betta at all.  If the change is less than 2 degrees or so a hardy fish won't even notice it.  But if you are worried, you can drain 25% of the tank at once, then add the new water (that has reached room temp) in 2 batches with 30 minutes between, which will cut the thermal swing in half.<br>  <br>  Don't try to heat the water on a stove, or anything - too much risk of messing up or deoxygenating the water.  And no, dechlorinators don't evaporate when they're in water.

tT256JQRaa	just give him crickets instead of mealworms, and when he gets hungry he'll eat them - he's not stupid and therefore isnt going to starve himself over something he'll prefer.<br>  i think its waxworms that are treats, not mealworms - either way dont give him to much of either - waxworms and very fatty and addictive, and mealworms contain large amounts of chitin and so can be difficult to digest :)|`|EAyzCH3Kaa	don't worry he will eventually eat the crickets reptile aren't picky if there hungry they wont pass up food.<br>  Just don't feed him the meal worms for a while then put some crickets in and he will eat them for sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|2F3ED33kaa	They all do that. Your gecko just rathers mealworms. They are still nutritious and can be used as a staple. My leopard gecko rathers Superworms than Mealworms or Crickets.
hKVOw1Sjaa	You need that area covered until the vet can replace the bandage.Elastoplast is not really very strong so if you can find a Pharmacy open and get any good bandage which will not be too tight like leukoplast will do but put gauze on first as it gives it extra protection.A sock is not very hygienic so try whatever you can to keep the wound from opening again and the dog chewing at it.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I used regular gauze on our dog, or a huge bandage, like 10 inches.  I guess if you got desperate you could use a sock or an old tee shirt.  Most vets have a way to contact them after hours, they should have told you how to contact them.  My current vet requires you to call her two times in a row before she answers the phone.|`|GZHS33n5aa	hi .iwas told to buy a bandage from wilkinsons just recover the bandageyou can buy elastaplast on a roll from anywhere really.,if your dog gos outside put a plastic bag on her bandage and tape on ,or you can cover with a sock and tape on .|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Get a new bandage.

ZCCFzvMBaa	Most dogs are full grown height wise by the age of one.  From age one to two is when they fill out their body more.  At least that has been my experiences.  I used to breed Cocker Spaniels.  So I  would say by 1 1/2 to 2 years.  Hope this helps a little.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Technically 1year or 12months! <br>  Same with every dog!<br>  <br>   However they may not behave like adults until 3 or 4years old!
uVTosLc9aa	When we lived in Florida, we shipped our doggie back to Alaska. She was at the time a 4 year old Rottie mix. We had someone there picking them up. The flight from Florida to AK is probably longer...but just an FYI they dont do anything with the animals. Nothing. Our dog was in that kennel so long....she pooed and everything all over herself. When our friend picked her up he said she was just covered in her own mess. Also, a blanket would be a good idea because its not heated for the animals in the cargo hold.

When you are away can you make sure you have the air conditioner on?  That is what we did.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	the dog would be fine, as long as it's an inside dog. i dont ever recommend people get dogs and keep them outside anyway. their coat will work as insulation in the winter against the cold and insulation in the summer against the heat, but they still would not fair well being outside for long periods of time in summer or winter|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	I live in Michigan, temperature are similar to those in New York.  My cousin lives across the street and has a Saint Bernard and she does fine all year.  She does not like to go out in the summer as much, but that is because she is spoiled by the air conditioning.|`|ZxLzNWvkaa	Its would be alright because they have to coats for winter.<br>  and they lose one coat for summer.<br>  But you might have to keep the dog water often.<br>  there extremely smart dogs so they're a good choice.<br>  and they drool a lot so you would have to carry around a towel <br>  unless you don't mind getting drool all over you lol.|`|Ry3JbhUsaa	I met people from southern Florida who had a Saint Bernard - we met out in Arizona in temps over 100 (dry heat, but HOT none-the-less) and the dog was hanging out in their van with the side door wide open.  He was shaved down with a summer cut to help him stay cooler - they said he's used to that kind of heat.  I've also seen several people where I live in Kentucky (where it can get below or over New York temps in some places) who have St. Bernards - they don't seem to have issues with it if they have plenty of water & a shady place to lie down.<br>  So theoretically, a St. Bernard should be fine for New York.  If you are concerned about the summer months, shave him/her down to let them have a little more comfort from the heat.|`|t6DTskXWaa	We live in Oklahoma with two smooth coat St. Bernards.  It gets very hot here, with the heat index often making it feel as if it is in the upper 90's to over 100 for days at a time. Ours stay inside in the air conditioning for much of the time during the summer and walks are only taken very early in the morning, before sun rise and before it gets too hot.  Temperatures over 70 to 75 make it more uncomfortable for them, so you want to make sure that they are not running around and then gulping large amounts of water.<br>  However, I know people who say that their Saints can tolerate the heat, if given plenty of water or shade, as long as they can get acclimated and not kept inside most of the time where it is cool and then forced outside during the heat of the day.  I would imagine that the temperatures do cool down some at night(where it does not in Oklahoma...may still be 90 at 10 PM).  I think that they will do fine in the winter, as long as they are given shelter to get away from the wind and enough unfrozen water.  When the temperatures get in the 20's and 30's, ours love to just lie outside, and will even pick a place in the shade at that time.<br>  The Saint Bernard Club of America website has a list of breeders from different parts of the country.  Contact one in your area and perhaps they could give you some information on how they cope with the changes in the temperature.|`|yKGKsWMsaa	I would get a plastic fish pond (largest that fits in you budget) and put it in the ground and let him/she sit in it if you don't have a pool but KEEP THE AC ON  all day and put some tile where ever its going to be sleeping (in the summer) and if I where you I would consider clipping his fur (finger length or shorter) if hes the long haired version but good luck with the new puppy!!

oxdme6xRaa	She has developed her own space where it is her domain and she feels safe and no one else is allowed to enter( under her rules) so u need to change it round as if u are a sociable person and like having people round then something needs to change. If she snaps/bites anyone it may become serious. She needs to understand that she is living in ur home and not hers. This is a normal jack russell trait. I would advise... no sleeping on ur bed, if u have a friend then she has to go in a separate room(not ur friend ur dog) and is allowed out if she is nice to people. She is showing a very aggressive stance if her fur is up. Dogs want to be in a communal environment and u are part of it as she has no one else there but u must be strong and sort the aggression out its important. Don't smack her or any thin like that i am sure u wouldn't anyway but a firm no will work wonders. I actually like her by the way as she reminds me of our border/lake land terrier that was the demon from hell but wow did we love her.|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	Have her on a leash and use your hand as a 'mouth' to bite her. It's more like a jab using your fingers, in the neck area. Don't hurt her, it serves more as a distraction. Have people come in and walk past for you to help train her. Be consistant, do it everytime she growls and hopefully she'll get the message.<br>  <br>  There's also the angle of you being pack leader and her not feeling like she has to protect you. Google it. :)|`|olacEAnsaa	What i would do is get 2 small pop cans and fill them with rocks! then put tape of the top so they don't spill out!

WWhYCAbSaa	It's not the prey drive.  They are establishing dominance over the cat/kitten.  This is normal.  They just need to keep the cat/kitten crated when they can't watch.

Even us humans don't get along as you can tell, good thing we don't have to live together huh.|`|KxNdCO4Vaa	if the owner wont coorispond to your reasoning then sadly there is nothing you can do about that, but somtimes persistancy does win so don't give up.  Usually animals just need time to adjust to a new house mate.  The dogs most definately need a trainer and much needed guidance.  Do not give up on trying to get your point to the owners, and if push comes to shove call the rspca or whatever they have as animal police in your area.|`|8crSDGSnaa	It's dead or will be.
WWhYCAbSaa	My answer remains the same.<br>  <br>  The dogs will eventually get used to the cat once the pecking order is established.  It's not the prey drive doing this.  They are trying to establish dominance, but the cat/kitten is too small right now, so they just need to crate it when they can't watch it.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i think their chancing it, 3 dogs are like a pack winding each other up. they might be to old and set in their ways to ever accept the cat|`|GSf09ALBaa	You have done all you can do.  If these dogs have small prey drive the cat will eventually be killed.  That is the bold truth of the matter.  Wash your hands of it.  You cannot force people to do what they choose not to do.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I fostered a dog that almost killed one of my cats.  It was aggressive small prey drive.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	That cat will be lunch if they decide to keep it. And keeping them in completely seperate is only going to intensify the dogs fixation on the cat when they do see it. They need to find the kitten another home|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	it wont as those dogs are aggressive i don't fancy that kitten s chances they need to supervise at all times or send the kitten back|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Other than mailing the cat a gun,you've done all that you can.|`|X4FQBmo9aa	I think you have done all you could if they will not listen.  I doubt there is any legal recourse here.  <br>  <br>  You are right though, that is a very dangerous situation for the kitten.  Are the pitbulls male or female?  I doubt motherly instincts would kick in, but we could always hope for it.  Lets hope that the kitty is quick and that your friends are not stupid enough to declaw the cat.  Its not just the prey instinct kicking it, it can also be simple jealousy.  <br>  <br>  Frankly, your friends sound like careless people who lack the intelligence to know that they should do research.  I used to have a chow and three cats.  The got along great, but that was because they were raised together and the dog had no idea he was behaving un-doglike.    <br>  <br>  I'd try again to impress on your friends how dangerous the situation can be for the kitten...<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	You should explain that again to them and say that they really shouldn't have a cat with 2 pit bulls.  Oh my gosh that cat is going to die!  How irresponsible of them to keep that cat in that enviorment|`|m4bUhvn5aa	Tell them to keep the cat in a seperate room and to slowly introduce them. Have them hold the cat and let the dogs smell it.|`|UxbwACHAaa	dogs and cats dont mix well|`|3swTodhhaa	I can't answer for the Pits... but Huskies do have a STRONG prey drive.  Most huskies will attack small dogs and cats.  Apparently, the your friend doesn't know anything about their pets.  I suggest they talk to others that have worked with these breeds with cats but if they don't separate them... the cat will most likely be killed. <br>  <br>  I personally would never leave them unattended together. Most ppl that we know that have been able to have a husky with a cat still don't trust them alone together.|`|Fyx3gS1Kaa	Many of the people responding are as ignorant as the pet owner being described. Saying a pitbull WILL kill a cat is the biggest crock i've heard, know why?<br>  <br>  I OWN AN AMERICAN PITBULL TERRIER AND A CAT WHO LOVE EACHOTHER.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, not all dogs react the same to cats REGARDLESS of the breed. If a dog doesn't accept a cat (especially if its older) it probably wont work and it would best to return the cat. <br>  <br>  Please stop badgering the breed. It accomplishes nothing and adds more UNTRUE crap about dogs into the world.|`|MU4EOe3oaa	To answer your question, you have done all you can do, so let it go.<br>  <br>  The dogs have to be "trained" to leave the cat alone. It takes A LOT of persistence, and it is not for everyone. The owner MUST be very vigilant and keep an eye on the dogs/cat constantly. The dogs must be corrected every single time they go after the cat. At no time should they be left alone untended. While the owners are gone the dogs and cat should be separated.|`|Ry3JbhUsaa	Yes, dogs and cats live together all the time, but they have to get used to each other.  Also, some breeds are less tolerant of cats - sometimes they will get over that tolerance issue, sometimes they won't.<br>  <br>  They should separate the cat from the dogs & try slowly introducing them to get them used to each other.  It will take some time - hopefully they can at least get to the point of tolerating each other.|`|AA12314059	The dogs actually have to be put on there bellies in to submission whenever they act aggressive to the cat. Keeping the separated will make it worse! <br>  <br>  To save the cat from bites while the dominance is established they could muzzle the dogs, but allow the cat to scratch if its cornered.|`|hQv43Xhmaa	Those are aggressive dogs, i'm not sure there is anything else that can be done.
FQyeGsIyaa	Yes, your boy might have been very excited (!) by the blanket.  He's maturing and it is time to get him neutered.  Check with a local rescue group, they can tell you where to go for low cost neutering - fortunately for you, males are less expensive to neuter than females.<br>  <br>  Many cats like fleece blankets too.  I keep one in the corner of the couch for my cat.  Sometimes she'll jump on it, kneed it and purr like crazy then settle in for a nap.  His attachment to the blanket isn't that weird.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	kittens do that stuff for sometime don't worry he will grow out of it|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	He's still a baby... and it is very comforting for kittens to suckle and knead at things.  Give him his own blanket or throw so he can have his "time" with his "blanky".... and please, get him neutered as soon as you can... it's not that expensive.|`|ohHUM6Slaa	This is very common in cats, especially cat's who were weened too early. I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that my cat Buddy (recently deceased) used to do that to, and he was 17 yrs old when he passed away. It is a comfort thing for your cat, and it is normal, just go to a store like big lots or a dollar store and get him a soft blanket that he can have. put it in his bed or near his fav. laying spot|`|W3lFsVgcaa	my kitten did the same thing. We asked our vet about it and he said that because the kittten is so used to nursing off of the mother that it is now thrying to nurse off of other things dont worry the kitten will stop soon.

Cropped ears serve a purpose they are not just cosmetic as the uneducated people say. And im surprise that one dog is on there, you can see every rib prominently same with the hip bones thats not what a boxer or any other dog should look like. <br>  <br>  I like "american" boxers. Just cause they have a shorter muzzle doesn't make them any less healthy.<br>  <br>  By far some of the WAY better looking dogs are not on the front page. Some of those all white muzzles may the dogs head look ugly. <br>  <br>  I much prefer a non sloping topline on a boxer, the sloping topline looks ugly.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Agree that the stacking is atrocious, which makes it challenging to see if the dogs have a good topline.<br>  <br>  By & large do prefer the European Dobermann, to the American, but have seen some striking American Dobermanns. That's my personal preference.|`|uTIgyCCHaa	I think they look more like boston terriers in the head than boxers, and their topline is much too sloped.  The back-end is lacking substance.<br>  <br>  You know, boxers in all areas of the world have strayed at least a little bit from the original standard... but European boxers have actually changed the most.

GVR9AjoQaa	Depends on if you intend to let them graze or if you're going to dry feed.  Depends on the quality of your pasturage- good grass mix?<br>  <br>  They need more than just land. Shelter is needed for protection from the elements.  Always fresh water.  Mineral block. Insect protection.

L4obbx3kaa	A boxer is a high energy dog, I don't think he'll necessarily get spoiled, but what would be my biggest worry would be to satisfy his exercise needs enough so he won't end up tearing the place he's in apart.<br>  Also if your dad is also willing to be part of the whole thing that would get my hopes up that you'll be able to make this work out.<br>  He should be okay staying home alone that time (after he's been puppy trained n all) but just make SURE he gets enough exercise so he won't become destructive and start biting and chewing on things.|`|TJUEaum0aa	I absolutely love boxers (have two myself-- the coolest animals that ever lived) but they are not for every family.  I'm not discouraging it, but there are some more things you need to think about before taking on the commitment to care for a living, feeling thing that is completely dependent upon you:<br>  <br>  First of all-- how do you plan on keeping him in your kitchen?  A boxer can easily clear a baby gate, and even if you can contain him, I think him "going" on the floor will be the least of your problems-- a bored boxer can tear apart a kitchen (or the entire house) in no time flat.  I would suggest getting a crate and leaving him in that while he is alone.  This will protect the house and also protect the dog from getting into potentially dangerous situations.  I think he will be fine in a crate for the amount of time he will be alone.<br>  <br>  Also, it will take more than a couple of walks a day to work off all that crazy boxer energy.  They are very active, playful, athletic dogs and they need to RUN.  Having a fenced-in yard would definitely be preferable.  Also, are you really prepared to get up early and walk this dog, in the rain or cold, several times a day, everyday, for the rest of his life?<br>  <br>  Boxers are very strong dogs and can get out of control quickly-- you will need to take him to obedience classes and train and socialize him very early.  This will be a lot of fun, but it can be very time consuming and expensive.  Early training is a must because, believe me, things that are cute as a puppy aren't so cute when that dog is 75 pounds and as strong as a bull.  They are very smart dogs and will learn quickly, though, they just need a lot of work and structure.<br>  <br>  (Oh, and in case you don't already know, boxers are notorious for having very bad gas.  The worst smell ever-- I swear to God, it can melt your face right off!!)<br>  <br>  I don't want to make it sound like I am saying getting a boxer is a bad idea, you should just know what you are getting into.  There are a lot of things on the web that talks about them in more detail, and books and stuff you can buy.  You sound very responsible and you have given this a lot of thought, just do your research before making any decisions.  <br>  <br>  On a more positive note-- boxers are just the funniest, coolest, goofiest dogs that have ever lived.  They are the most fun you can have with a dog-- and coming home and seeing them do their little wiggle-butt happy-boxer dance will make all the hard work worth it!
9IZ0CmxPaa	Practice makes perfect for keeping your leg in the right position. As for keeping your foot in the stirrup it's probably because your heel isn't down far enough. So focus on keeping your heel pushed down at all times.<br>  <br>  I'd work on things to build up your leg, it doesn't sound like your a very strong rider. I's suggest actually doing a lot of trotting exercises without your stirrups (posting or sit trotting) to help build up your leg. That will also help keep your heel down, your leg in place, and keep your foot from falling out.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Shorten your stirrups so when you drop them the iron should hit your ankle. <br>  <br>  Breathe. If you are scrunching your legs to grip with your knees taking a deep breath and letting it out will help deepen your seat and lengthen your leg and help keep your feet in.|`|FtEkredUaa	You can try putting your stirrup leathers up two holes. Although it may feel uncomfortable you will soon get used to it. Also make sure that your heels are down (but not too far that they will fall out) <br>  I have the same trouble I jump with my stirrups too long so my feet fall out right before the jump, but now the leathers are up higher and its a lot easier. Hope i helped :)|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	Your pinching with your knees, your tensing up. Your weight leaves your stirrups and you and tense your thighs and pinch your knees, have someone video tape you and I will put money on it that's what you are doing. <br>  <br>  You can do two things:<br>  One: Take away stirrups and learn to put your weight where it needs to be.<br>  Two: Shorten the stirrups and ride in two point position. In the two point you will learn to put your weight down your leg and into your heals.

Labradors, Golden Retrievers, etc., have been known to allow children of any age to pet them, play with them, sit on them and tug on them.  Smaller dogs (such as Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, etc.), however, can become aggressive towards small children, and reasonably so.  Think about it - small children can be rough, and smaller dogs know this.  Often they can become scared of young children, and this can lead to them running away from, snapping or even biting or clawing at the children.  I have had some experience with dogs and kids together, and so far I have noticed that medium to large sized dogs work very well with children, while smaller dogs will tend to avoid them.  But no matter what dog breed you choose, make sure to teach the children to follow these rules - don't touch the dog's eyes, ears or tail, and never hit the dog, not even lightly.  Such actions could prove disastrous, especially with a small dog.  If you want to learn about different dog breeds and how they work with children, you might try the following link:|`|Ry3JbhUsaa	I was watching 'Dogs 101' on Animal Planet the other day - they give really good information on general breed information.  If I remember correctly, the one I saw the other day had mentioned the golden retriever as a very good family pet, but there are several out there.  Part of your selection criteria should also include general health concerns for a given breed, grooming requirments, etc.  All of these are covered on that show - it's a good source of info if you catch the episodes that have breeds you are interested in (they have several in a single 1-hour episode).|`|gBIrmaOXaa	Hiya, i have had boxers all my life and i have NEVER had a nasty one and have always till their dying day been very, very tolerant of children they are not snappy. They are hyper active dogs and need plenty of exercise and good training but they know when children are about. They are loyal, have loads of character and definately a family dog that doesnt like to be left for too long. Like with all breed there is no breed that can be 100% trusted at all times but i would def recommend a boxer but make sure you get from a reptuable breeder and heart scores for both parents (pref grandparents) are known. Do your research on the breed to see if it suits your lifestyle id def recommend if it does<br>  Labradors have a very similar reputation to boxers, both need plenty of exrcise and strict training cause can become hyper if not stimulated mentally so either, im only going on my personal experience with boxers.|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	It depends what kind of family you are, if you are very active and fit and have loads of time to spend with a new dog, a collie or a lab would be great. Greyhounds are fantastic family dogs and they need very little exercise as they are quite lazy and love to curl up in front of a fire, they are very gentle animals. Boxers make lovely family dogs, they are great with kids if they are brought up in a family environment. hope that helps? xxx|`|oxdme6xRaa	Labrador....... I have been bought up with dogs all my life i am 44 now by the way. Terriers i.e Border etc can be snappy as they like their own space, German shepherd not sure we had a lovely one but may not all be the same. small breeds can be difficult. Lively dogs  as in collies etc maybe too boisterous and can also possibly be snappy sometimes. Buy from a reputable breeder and meet the people that are breeding and obviously the sire and dam as this may tell u a lot. If 2 beautiful people get together and have a child the end product may not look the same if u get what i mean. Breed is irrelevant, My name is julia by the way on my fiancees computer.temperament is imperative. Maybe a good idea to buy a dog that is 18 months plus that has shown its true colours and take ur child to the sellers house to see if everything works. U wont have to suffer the poop scoop stuff either then. I hope in whatever u decide works.|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	A whippet. We've just got a whippet cross puppy for this reason..

Very little is know about it, but what causes the raised scales is fluid building up under the skin, inside the betta's tissue. Usually what causes fluid to build up is simple kidney failure. And as you know, once the kidneys fail, the body dies. I think that is why we have had so little luck (mmmmm... Let me rephrase, NO LUCK AT ALL) in treating successfully bettas with dropsy. Although dropsy (the symptom) itself is not contagious, BACTERIA THAT CAUSE THE KIDNEY FAILURE in the first place usually are very very contagious. Since I stopped feeding live worms to my bettas I have not seen one single case of dropsy in my fishroom :). Thank God!<br>   <br>  SYMPTOMS:   <br>  It is easy to diagnose a betta with Dropsy: Look for two signs: an abnormally big (bloated) belly and if you look at betta from the top, raised scales. Scales will look like an open pine cone. If you see this, you are out of luck, and so is Betta. He will soon go to betta heaven :((â¦<br>   <br>  TREATMENT:  <br>  No known cure. Keep water clean, keep him AWAY from any other bettas etcâ¦ On occasion, in the case of a very mild raised scales, I have seen bettas recover on their own. But I suspect that this is because those cases are NOT real dropsy. Real dropsy always kill. So I guess you have to wait and see what happens. Treating is pretty useless. It may take up to 15 days for betta to die, though usually about 5 days. Any betta with dropsy should be immediately ISOLATED!!!! Prayer may not hurt.<br>   <br>  DISEASE: UNKNOWN â POSSIBLE DEPRESSION <br>  uGENERAL INFO:   <br>  <br>  Sometimes a betta will act sick but not exhibits any symptoms. He could either have internal parasites, or some mild bacterial infection, or simply be depressed. Bettas often become depressed when they are first jarred as young fries, and get separated from their siblings. Also, males often become depressed after spawning. A depressed betta will stop eating and swimming around and may let himself starve to death. This is not as unusual as one may think!<br>   <br>  uSYMPTOMS:   <br>  Bettas may or may not have slightly clamped fins, lay at bottom or at surface, not eat, barely swim around. They will not flare or build bubble nests.<br>   <br>  uTREATMENT:  <br>  Do a full water change for jars or a 70% water change for tanks. Isolate any suspected sick betta. Add two drop of BettaZing (included in our Betta First Aid Kit) to each quart of water (so 8 drops per gallon). If the betta was just spawned or just jarred, and it is likely to simply have depression: In the case of a newly jarred young betta, float his jar inside the tank where his siblings still are. This should help him cope with the isolation. In the case of a male who has just been spawned, try floating him inside a tank containing lots of other bettas, females preferably. It has always worked for me. When floating a jar in a larger tank, be careful: if you ha|`|rrLHU6ehaa	No, it's not normal.  Temperature is a good possibility.

When mine stopped eating it was near the time that he left us. Fish are fish, it's sad but don't jump to conclusions because there could be something simple you're just forgetting.

Sorry about you losing your dearly beloved pet, but read this and believe<br>  <br>  Rainbow Bridge<br>  Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. <br>  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.<br>   <br>  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. <br>  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. <br>  <br>  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. <br>  <br>  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....  <br>  <br>  Author unknown...|`|2Ijd5umAaa	How old are you..8?

m16gf9mzaa	I have one of these:  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/New-Rubbermaid-Pet-Carrier_W0QQitemZ120269414705QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?_trksid=p3286.m20.l1116" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/New-Rubbermaid-Pet-C...</a> and it's great. It has really strong straps you can put the seat belt through, to protect in case of a car accident.  Its over-the-shoulder strap is very convenient and comfortable for carrying. There are several pockets that I find handy for putting my checkbook in, or the papers from the vet (receipts and instructions and certificates of vaccination, etc). It's got a comfortable cushion inside that comes out for easy clean-up in case of the other kind of accident (speaking from personal experience).  My cats love it, too.  I leave it out and open next to my desk, and they use it as a cat bed in between visits to the veterinarian.  I think that also helps them to feel more secure when we do go to the vet.  <br>  <br>  One disadvantage is, I don't think Rubbermaid is making them anymore.  So you might pretty much be stuck with that one on the eBay link if you do like it.|`|goCkjhDzaa	Well they nbow have those strollers that you can push your cat around in.

You can have an extra cute one for when you get out of the car but don't compromise your cat's safety in the name of fashion.  Most cats prefer to stay at home anyway and if you're going to have the cat in there long enough to play, you're going to have it in there too long. Cats aren't shopping buddies nor do they enjoy sitting in a cage while you talk with your friends.  Leave the cat at home unless it's for a vet visit or grooming session.|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	Good lord....isn't it bad enough that people humiliate their dogs?

Hope that helps!|`|6QNJyLp9aa	Well. it is your horse. if you really want it, and you are willing to move to georgia or alaska for him and his occupation, leaving family and friends behind, i think it would be an extremely supportive and loving gesture on his part to let you ship your mare with you. Sounds like you may not see alot of him in the air force, and it would be nice to have a project such as a young foal to work with to make the time pass. I dont think it is at all an unreasonable request. considering what you are giving up for him. Bring up some of these points, explain that this is very important to you, a passion of horses, a dream of raising and training a foal.

Unfortunately, this may be a relationship issue instead of a horse issue.  Can you compromise?  Can you save up some extra money to move the horse?  On the other hand, are you up to raising a horse in Alaska?  Is it fair to the horse?  I live in the deep south, so I don't know, but those are things you might want to consider.  Also, it is hard on a mare (just like a woman) to travel in the last days, it could risk the mare and the foal's health.  If you could leave the mare behind safely for a couple of months, or ship her out a couple of months early????

With apologies to the men on here, it sounds like a typical man kind of response, in that he is not thinking of the horse as a friend and companion, but rather as an asset or "item."<br>  <br>  Air Force life is hard.  There is a lot of moving.  It is stressful and expensive even without a horse.  I know the bases we were at had boarding available on base, though.  Quantico Marine Corps base also has some kind of cooperative stable.  It might not be too hard to find a good boarding arrangement.  But I'm glad I didn't have to do that every time we moved.<br>  <br>  I think your argument is that you are NOT going to sell your horse and buy a new one every time you move.  It's just not feasible.  It's hard to find just the right horse!  Also, he needs to understand that the horse is your pet and friend and means as much to you as a favorite dog (or more!!!).  Help him to understand that this is not like a car or something, this is a friend.  Having your own horse is going to help you deal with the stress of being an AF wife.  <br>  <br>  You are in for a lot of stress!  You lose your identity--all of a sudden you need to know his social security #, but not yours.  Life revolves around his squadron.  It's hard to find a job.  Often local folks will discriminate against AF wives because they know you will move soon, so they might not hire you.<br>  <br>  I wish I'd had a horse for the stress management factor when we were in the AF.  But I'm glad I didn't because I can't imagine all the extra work and worry that would have been with all the moves.<br>  <br>  I am not sure this is the bes time for you to be training a baby.  And what if you do get Alaska?  I hope you are looking into horsey arrangements in AK now!  And how would you get her there?  That is a LONG trailer ride!<br>  <br>  Maybe you could compromise:  If you get GA, you get to keep your horse.  But, if you get AK, you realize that is just not doable, and you will sell and either buy a new one there, or wait until you are back in CONUS.<br>  <br>  I guess I wasn't much help with your questions, but you have some thinking to do about what is best for you AND the horse AND her baby.  <br>  <br>  Remember that marriage is all about compromise and what is best for both of you.  He needs to understand that this will be a huge change for you and he needs to be sensitive to what you need.  You need to be sensitive to his desire to create a financially stable home.    There will need to be some give and take.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you're in for a bit of a roller coaster ride!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	You should do some research on shipping costs and board in both areas. You don't want to board on base, so find someplace off base. Board in Alaska isn't too bad but you should call around. If he's going to Alaska he'll either be going to Eilson or the one by Fairbanks (I forget the name). Find out where he'd be going in Georgia and call around the towns down there.<br>  <br>  Once you see the expense of shipping your horse you can make the decision to bring her or not. I told my husband before we got married that the horse and I are a package deal, take it or leave it.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Anytime another person expect you to rearrange your life for their benefit, you have to reconsider the relationship.<br>  <br>  Back in the late 70's I got engaged to a young man who basically got upset when I sold my 8 yr old AQHA gelding so I could buy a 3 yr old and start the schooling a green horse again.<br>  <br>  It was okay he bought a corvette, but I was told I could ride his then late teenager TWH gelding instead of buying another horse.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, the relationship didn't work.  BTW the 8 yr old AQHA gelding came home 7 mos after our relationship fizzled.|`|RloOJ43haa	You need to think very hard about this marriage. If you are not even married yet and you need 'permission' to keep your horses this does not bode well. Clearly he does not see the horses as family members and is quick to dispose of them as property, but a horse is not a sofa.|`|AA12048299	Greg B's got it right: Dump the finacee. Keep the horse.<br>  <br>  If my husband had told me to get rid of a critter during our courtship, he'd have found himself on the curb. Well... he sort of did, hated the curb and spent the next 2+ years, and more $$ on a 2nd engagement ring, chasing to get me back.<br>  <br>  The critters? Yup. They're still here. And he helps pay to support them.
tY14vbrKaa	Ask your breeder what they recommend.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	I have a toy fox terrier (12 pounds) that is very squirmy and can wriggle out of a collar, no matter how tight it is (I don't use a choke collar). So, I got him just the smallest nylon strap harness they sell in the collar section of Petco. It works fine and, even though he's a short-haired breed, it isn't uncomfortable on him. Remember, with a harness, the tension on the leash is distributed more evenly around the dog's body. So, a padded harness isn't really necessary.|`|4pEiE6r6aa	I use Guardian Gear Two-Step Harness, which allows them to just slip their front legs into the holes and then you clip it on the back.  It's super easy to put on, the easiest I've ever used, nothing has to fit around the neck like all the others, too.  It fits perfectly on my long-haired chihuahua, so it'll work perfect for your papillon!
grJG2c8jaa	This fish are great but you shouldn't get the sharks.<br>  They will be to boisterous for tetras and Apistogramma's. These fish are usually very appealing but in the end they won't be worth the damage they cause. Maybe consider getting 3-4 more corycats instead. They will help keep the tank clean and corys will also appreciate being in a group.<br>  Good Luck with your tank|`|3GjotXPXaa	your tank seems like a 29 gallon and no, that's not too many fish, you should also get 4 more bleeding heart tetras and one more platy to make your fish feel more comfortable.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Return the sharks now, stores have every right to turn you away and refuse overgrown fish, and many do. Keeping them now is unfair and stressful on their part.<br>  <br>  The rest is ok, but only ok, not perfect. If the apisto's decide to spawn they may well try and drive the other fish away. Spawning apisto's need a tank to themselves.
5QG9Zrjaaa	Another option you should consider is a side pull or a Lindell.  These are more gentle than a mechanical hackamore or a bosal.  It is a whole headstall with a rawhide nose, and rings on the sides to attach reins to.  I have had good luck with my sidepull; I have good brakes with it, and steering is easy.  Trying to get a horse to have a "headset"  or "on the aides" is a bit difficult, but it is a good option before training a bit.<br>  <br>  I got mine for about $35 from a carriage shop in Ponca City, OK, but I've never seen one for less than $50 since then (10 years ago).|`|xzJi0bcSaa	A bosal would be much nicer than a mechanical hackamore in my opinion. I dont like to use them, I ride my horses in the most mild bit I can, if that doesnt work, I train them to respond better, and if that doesnt work, I move up a step, so, I would suggest starting out in this, <a href="http://www.horse.com/Fleece-Lined-Hackamore-WBE12.html," rel="nofollow">http://www.horse.com/Fleece-Lined-Hackam...</a> and moving up from there. Good luck! (plus this one is $20, but you need to buy a headstall and reins separate.) Or this bosal, <a href="http://www.horse.com/Rawhide-Bosal-Headstall-WCB59.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.horse.com/Rawhide-Bosal-Heads...</a> Again, reins dont come with it and make sure if its really stiff, you wrap it in something like vet wrap or fleece so it doesnt rub.|`|BHkwWWIAaa	A bosal OR a bit-less bridle, which really is kinda like a halter. I love the bit-less bridle, it's really great for horses who just aren't happy in the bit - and more and more disciplines accept it (sadly, not hunter/jumper)<br>  <br>  A mechanical hackamore can be VERY severe in the wrong hands. I love this, too, but only for real problem horses or horses with hard mouths who just don't respond to schooling in a bit, and then only until I am reasonably sure I can work them in either a bit-less or a kimberwicke.

TGWgBJRVaa	First things first; Congrats on saving a rescue cat! I have been doing feral cat rescue for about 20 years and I'm so glad you took a chance on this boy. There are so many cats that desperately need homes, so thank you for being part of the solution!<br>  <br>   Now, as far as his behavior goes, this is pretty typical of a feral cat, but it CAN be changed. I have hand tamed and adopted out MANY ex-feral cats. They have all adapted to indoor homes & become loving pets.  <br>   I would wait a while to get another cat, but eventually, that is an excellent idea. I've found that all of my cats seem to enjoy being around a small group of other cats.<br>     For now, he needs some one-on-one training with you. Keeping him in a room of his own is a great way to make him feel safe & secure. When you go into that room, try laying down on the floor and reading a book or doing a cross-word, etc. Something quiet, so that you are in there, at his level, but ignoring him. He'll get curious about you & want to see what you're up to. Bring some yummy food, like canned cat food, in with you and feed him tiny bits right near you. See how he does for the next few weeks or even a few months. Some cats come around pretty easily, some take a long time. Being quiet and gentle should win him over in the end. <br>   I would recommend adopting an adult cat, not a kitten, to be his companion. Kittens can be overwhelming to older cats and tend to pester them terribly. If you can find a really friendly, affectionate cat to adopt, he or she may show your shy boy how to trust people.<br>     It doesn't matter what sex the new cat is. It's the personality that is important. I've always had groups of cats together and it's always been a mix of males and females. Sometimes unrelated males become the best of buddies. It all depends on how you introduce them and their individual personalities.<br>   Give your new cat a little more time, some quiet attention and keep in mind that food is a powerful tool when taming a cat.<br>   Best of luck to you!|`|Ry3JbhUsaa	With the cat having had companions pretty much all his life (it sounds like), I'd say get another cat, but I think it would be good for him to get used to his surroundings before that.  If it were me, I'd get a kitten - that way, he won't feel like he has to establish the pecking order over an older cat (possibly stressing him somewhat).  Cats are normally social creatures - they generally crave company (in my experience).|`|KxNdCO4Vaa	i would get a kitten for him. We had a cat just like him, he would hide and never come out.  We bought/rescued a kitten and he started to come around and become more friendly.  Cats do somtimes get lonely.<br>  Just remember, no cat is exactly alike, different results may occurr, but the worst that could happen is the older cat would bully the other, but this most likely will not happen.|`|XomCHGrtaa	I think getting another kitten as a companion is a great idea! If he is used to having other cats around, then he is likely feeling lonely. As for the sex of the kitten, I would go for female, so neither of them feel like they would have to compete for the dominance as the Alpha male.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help! :)|`|wvsPOFY4aa	He should have the place to himself...<br>  <br>  Even if they dont get into fights, there are a few reasons...<br>  <br>  1.) 2 cats are harder to care for<br>  2.) The 2nd cat might be a little destructive...<br>  3.) Your current cat will most likely get used to your house|`|6eqJSffkaa	Be patient with the cat as its scared of its new surroundings and is afraid to come out of hiding.  Given time he will emerge and gradually get used to the place and to you. It may take a lot of patience on your part to allow him to do this but he has to do it in his own time. <br>  <br>  I have a cat living with me that was completely wild and afraid when I first got him (he only came into my life because he was injured).  He took months to accept me and his surroundings but food and affection worked in the end!<br>  <br>  I'm not sure that getting another cat is the answer at this point in time.|`|4ASDeXsgaa	.|`|AA11352641	I would not advise getting another cat yet. His problem isn't that he's lonely, it's that he's scared, distrustful, and not properly socialized. Give him time to feel comfortable and safe and see what kind of personality emerges from him. Right now he's probably just see another cat as a potential threat. Often an adult cat will not bond with another cat. The best chance of that happening is when they are together from kittenhood. Domestic cats are actually solitary animals, not pack animals like dogs. I have 6 cats and none of them really get along like buddies, they just tolerate each other.|`|rmnvkIBXaa	You could try another cat, he might like the company. you would probably have a better time if you got a female, because the 2 males would probably fight. and if you do get the second cat, you might want to get another litter box because sometimes they dont like to share them.|`|UzC9gsi0aa	I know guy<br>  He send kitten, ya?<br>  I just need first payment of five thousand moneys. Yes, good offer?<br>  Good, good<br>  I'll see you in dark alley<br>  I'll have kitten<br>  You have moneys, okay?|`|oeW1WDXfaa	???????????????????|`|cQoNzj5Gaa	+2 points kthx<br>  and have fun with ur cat looks good to me
a2cjwMKcaa	The filter need to run all the time. Shutting it off for a short time, cleaning the tank, brief power cuts etc wont do any harm.<br>  <br>  But more than a few hours and your cycle bacteria will start to die off.<br>  <br>  Tell your frogs to harden up and ignore the filter.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Having a filter isn't necessary unless you don't want to clean the tank as often. Be really careful when choosing filters I've heard of drowning froggies who got stuck to the filter intakes! If you need to, you may want to look into covering the filter with a cheesecloth or nylon panty hose with a rubber-band wrapped around the intake if they are small.<br>  <br>   It also is recommended to turn the level down as far as it will go if you're worried. Another idea is a sponge filter that hooks up to your aerator pump. They are only sold online or at small LFS. As far as the bacteria goes it will mess it up as the filter has media that needs to stay wet and push water through the intake to keep the bacteria alive in your tank.|`|cNStB5ZQaa	yes!  turning any filter off for more than a couple of hours will kill the good, nitrifying bacteria. they need the aeration that the water flow provides. if it stays off, the tank will go stagnant and putrid.  if you restart it after a few hours, those dead bacteria will be toxic in your tank and probably kill your frogs (&fish?).  with a filter that hangs on the side of your tank or sits on top of the gravel you should replace the carbon & floss before restarting and make sure the dirty water in the hanging filter doesn't get into your tank. with an under gravel filter, i can only tell you what i've done after a power failure: restart it and immediately do at least a 25% water change. add some kind of nitrifying agent, (available at pet store,) you might have to wait through a period of cloudy water (bacteria bloom) until your good bacteria balance is re-established. you should test for ammonia, which is deadly, until the cycle is complete. looks like i gave you a little more information than you asked for!  my bad.  the frogs will get used to the filter noise.|`|VVSGFDJkaa	Actually, the filter can be tuirned off for a few days, but then you should probably turn it on again. Otherwise, the tank will get gross. Try buying on of those quiet filters.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|SOxdyWQOaa	try getting a different filter and yes it will mess with the good bacteria in your tank<br>  <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish
B6zl0AJDaa	FIRST rule of thumb with ANY Equine, when changing feeds, DO IT GRADUALLY.  Start off by adding a little bit of the new hay or grain to the exsisting feed.  Then increase it by a little bit each feeding and taking away the SAME amount of the old feed.<br>  <br>  Also, do you bran your ponies?  Red flakey wheat bran about a 1/2 a coffee can full mixed with boiling water and allow to steep until it's just warm.  I do this twice a week or when something has changed either a move or new horse has been introduced.|`|pUpPXNzLaa	do it gradually...over time|`|fydy8Zjpaa	for about 2 weeks just mix the 2 types of foods to prepare the horse's stomach for that type of food. No biggy..just dont over feed. :)|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	VERY slowly, feed what you are feeding but cut it in half.. add 1/4 of the new feed and mix it in. Over the next week, at least..remove some old, add some new.  Just a little at a time, so their stomachs adjust.<br>  You really only need to do this if the new feed has different ingredients, (like going from oats to alfalfa pellets) that have different grains and higher protein levels. <br>  Make sure it is the grain and not something in the pasture.  And is it true colic or gas colic?  Gas colic can cause a reaction like true colic, but happens easily. The change of the weather is a good example of what can cause gas colic.<br>  What puzzles me is when you say: it's nearly gone now... colic is not one of those things that takes days to go away, are you sure it is colic and not something you are feeding that is making them sick?  Another strange thing is that two horses "got colic" at the same time.<br>  I would check what you are feeding them and make sure it is not moldy or insect/rodent infested. Check the water , too.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Start by placing small amounts of the old food in with the new food and mix it through. Increase this amount over the course of about 2 weeks and gradually decrease the new food.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	Changing feed must be done incrementally using old to new escalating mixes over a period of about 7-10 days.|`|otojKoEkaa	wean them slowly. Feed what they are getting now with a quarter of what you want them to get eventually for about 3 days. Then up it to half of the old half of the new for 3 days. Then do 1/4 old 3/4 new for 3 days. finally you can feed them their entire meal of new grain.<br>  <br>  Also the spring grass could have made them colic if you left them out there to long. You should only leave them out there for like 15 and increase is slowly each day.<br>  <br>  Be really careful because ponies are more likely to founder and good luck|`|dKfWQcP1aa	Don't know precisely the cause. My horse got colic from getting too much hay! ( too much dry food caused an impaction in the gut). If you want to change the food the answer is to do it gradually, adding a little of the new food and taking out a little of the old until you get it turned around. Do your ponies work very hard? If not they might do very well with just good hay and some Hi Fi Lite dampened with unmolassed sugar beet for a bucket feed.|`|AA11196683	I would do it slowly. and give them a probiotic that aids in digestion of the feed. I use Fastrack and never had any problem with colic.|`|fLMc72q4aa	Do it slowly, replace a little of the old food with the new over a few days, gradually increase the amount of the food you want to give them, while decreasing the food you dont want them to have.   Do it over a couple of weeks and it should be fine.|`|DrZTpyRgaa	Slowly mix the old food and new food together over a period of time.
KxNdCO4Vaa	it is very normal.  When a cat is spayed it is actually a sergury.  So think about it, you just got back from a scary place that does not smell like home, strangers handling you all day, strange drugs that discorupt your vision and make you feel dizzy and when you wake up your in much pain and still dizzy and shaky.  Not much fun, your cats are probably 1) in pain from surgury and 2) very tired from all that had happened to them, it's a very stressful thing for a cat.|`|8vDyvxePaa	A few years ago a stray cat had kittens in our backyard then abandoned them.  We took them to a shelter to get them fixed a few months later and the vet sedated and numbed them so they wouldn't be in pain.  For the first day they just laid down in the grass and did... well, nothing really.  They couldn't move well because of the numbing, and the anesthetics made them really sleepy. (if you've been knocked out for surgery before you'd know that for the first day or so afterward you just sleep)<br>  <br>  I think it's totally normal.|`|elfIbUCmaa	call your vet.|`|SFteh6Mwaa	It's very normal to be in pain after a surgery, for animals and people alike. Your cats will feel better when they are on pain medication and even better when they are heeled.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	It is normal.  They are probably still under the effects of the drugs that the vet used on them during surgery.  They will probably be in some pain for the next few days.|`|FfNjsqGvaa	depends on the cat. Mine were spry and immediately were jumping around and on the stairs, cupboards and doing all these things that the vet said I should not let them (how to stop a cat I don't know short of locking them up... and that does not go over well and usually ends up with a wad of poop in the room they are locked in).<br>  <br>  However some cats take it harder. I mean that is major surgery. Some need time to bounce back. I would think that reaction is more normal than how my boys reacted.|`|FCY3lwnoaa	This is normal.  They are still recovering.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned, you should call your vet and they will answer your questions.  However, it is quite normal for them to be tuckered out and quiet for a few days.|`|p82sIbAAaa	yeah, they are probably going to be sore for a few days. they need rest and be sure to give them the medication. They should be okay in a few days, if not defiantly schedule an appt. with the vet.|`|PGiOSIBkaa	Probably just mad at the world because they can't lick themselves.  Animals enjoy licking themselves, so I'm sure they are ok if you give them the pain meds tomorrow.

It sounds as if he might have a mild health issue, if his behaviour has recently changed.  If he is physically good, it may be a good idea to get a friend for him.  You might also try a trusted friend as a dog sitter instead of a kennel, while out of town.  I dog sit for my sister, and her dogs are way happier.  <br>  <br>  You dog might take the other dog as an example, but you need to be sure you give them both equal attention and love, or he might just become more depressed and unruly.  It is always a challenge to bring a new dog in with an older dog.  You might want to consult his veterinarian about the addition of another animal. Consult the veterinarian and maybe a skilled dog trainer for tips on working with deaf animals - you might be able to use a flash light or possibly vibrations to train him.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I would get another dog in this case.  There are sites like deaf dogs .org, and deaf dogs .com too.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	yes i would if i was you it will be company for him, i had a rottie then got a gsd it was the best thing i ever did  and they was always the best of friends and had so much fun together, i never had no need to neuter either of them.the gsd was a rescue and had been abused and so was afraid of new people it was amazing to see the rottie reasure him , he had also been starved and never really got over that so would steal food at any chance he got the rottie use to stop him by nudging him gently and blocking him it was like he was saying no dont do that, so i believe that dogs do take care of each other.
rrLHU6ehaa	It depends on the species of pleco.  Not all are algae eaters, and some are omnivores, needing meaty foods like brine shrimp, small insects, small worms, fish, etc. Some feed mainly on wood, others feed on plants other than algae.<br>  So it could be something missing from it's diet.  Know for sure which species you have and research.<br>  No pleco eats "poop".|`|yVsuERSFaa	plecos could eat food at the bottom of the tank and fish poop 2 (disgusting). i never feed my pleco anything and he's perfectly fine. he can survive alright with the other fish' left over fish food.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	I assume then that you've offered him Algae wafers? Mine did the same thing only difference was I had him for 2 years. It is definitely a sign of concern. I noticed little white flukes on him and administerd Lifeguard by Jungle Labs. None of the other fish had this problem but I gave it to the whole tank and within 72 hours he was fine.<br>  <br>  Check his body for signs of disease, if his feeces is stringy, white or clear looking then he is definitely in distress due to a parasite or bacteria.|`|CqquoBy4aa	Plecos don't always eat when they look like they are hungry.  So you have to wait for them.
OyNJTWaiaa	From first sign of mating up to a week to lay the first egg. An egg every second day after that until she has what she considers her perfect sized clutch.

Wrong.<br>  I search through a certain dog ad site daily (angers me but I'm addicted) and the number of poor purebred puppies being sold on weeks after being bought because 'circumstances changed' is ridiculous. You won't be selling your puppies on spay/neuter contracts and you certainly won't take back unwanted puppies so the likelihood is that your puppies will either produce yet more badly bred dogs or they'll be passed around homes.<br>  Congrats.<br>  Get a new hobby.|`|9kTejB0uaa	WHAT!!!!!   And they are pointing the fingers at show people over the problems with Cavs.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but why on earth .......<br>  <br>  These are basic questions (barking apart) which you should have found out about before you got this far.  But before I totally lose it -<br>  <br>  Puppies begin to open their eyes at around 10 days.  It depends on the environment you have them in though.  If it's quite dark, they will open sooner (in my experience!!) than if you have them in strong light.  But they won't actually focus properly for quite some time after that.  It's still all down to the wee noses.<br>  <br>  They 'need to be weaned' from around 3 weeks, depending on how many puppies you have in the litter.  If you have a large litter, you will probably need to be supplementing them quite early on.  By 3 weeks you start to introduce them to just a little raw meat (this is based on what I did, others may have different ideas!).  Don't be tempted to overdo the meat (which they will absolutely go nuts for) as too much too soon will upset their tummies.  They still need to be taking milk from mum.  You can also start them lapping, just a little, holding each one individually, from a shallow dish - goats milk is the best as it's closest to ******'s milk.  By 5/6 weeks mum should only be going into the whelping box to check on them, and to allow them to comfort suckle (she will remain standing, usually).  Some bitches don't want to do this, preferring to get back to their normal life, while others, the more maternal types, love to be with their puppies right up to the day they leave.<br>  <br>  But it's not too late to find a mentor - are you still in touch with the breeder of your ******.  She'd be the obvious choice (assuming she's reputable, and cares!!).<br>  <br>  They won't bark, probably, before they leave for their new homes - although they may play yap/growl/squeal etc.etc.<br>  <br>  Get your ****** spayed in another couple of months!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	These are all things you should have learned before you whelped the litter.  At three weeks start feeding them dry food soaked in milk in addition to allowing them to nurse.  They open their eyes somewhere between one to two weeks old, depending on the pup.  They make noise right from the beginning, but I have never noticed when they actually start to bark.
C1eHfhrHaa	Clean it up as soon as she does it and keep the yard picked up too.

Make sure its for your size dog. Like small dog medium etc.<br>  To prevent this, there is something you give them that makes their droppings taste yucky and they won't eat it.

Female dogs can come into season twice a year. The size of the dog seems to have some bearing on the frequency, for example a Saint Bernard usualy only has a season once a year. WHilst a smaller Terrier breed can come in every 6 months.<br>  The seasons always last about 3 weeks. You have a week of bleeding disharge, a week where they are most fertile and dont bleed as much, and then another week of  discharge.<br>  Most breeders will try to mate their female dogs on the 9-11th day after they first noticed the bleeding. This is the most fertile time and also the time the girl will be more happy to see the boy dog.<br>  If you are intending on breeding and you dont have a male dog on the premisis, try to atleast introduce a candidate before the  9-11the day, so she is most comfortable with him.<br>  If you dont want to breed your dog - Do not under any circumstances take her out of your yard. She will leave a scent trail for any hobo dogs in the neighbourhood to follow and drive other dogs too distraction (especially if you took her to the park for a run) Absolute No No.<br>  The season is finished once her Vulva is back to its normal size and she is not bleeding.<br>  GOod luck!|`|yXUS7jz5aa	A total of 3 weeks.1 week coming on 1 week being on properly and 1 week going off.The last week is the hardest as she can be brought into full heat again by a good male.|`|QK1jfKG9aa	For a month towards the end of each year, specially female dogs.|`|Fv9CgC3haa	not for long

9kceDOTraa	Tank size seems to be the main issue here but as well, gender is likely to be the other cause.  As with many cases with cichlid keeping, multiple males in the same area usually cause a problem.  As another generally accepted guideline, Oscars are advocated to be kept as a single fish a 55 gallon tank, a pair in a 90, a trio usually about a 125, but I'd opt for at least a 150 or higher myself.<br>  <br>  It's important to point out that a 125, 150 and 180 are all standard six feet long tanks, with the difference being in the width.<br>  <br>  Oscars are also monomorphic so you are not going to be able to tell what gender they are visually.  You may have a male female pair with a second male.  It's hard to say what is the case without knowing what your tank size is, the size of the Oscars as well as some visual information about what you are seeing.  Take a video.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	That's what Oscars do, they're territorial Cichlids. The only way to stop the fighting is to split them up.<br>  <br>  For multiple adult Oscars you need over 150 gallons anyway.|`|p1gzHgAraa	im betting your tank is too small to begin with. Also, most oscar keepers cannot keep 3 oscars together-you will have 2 that pair up, and they will beat down the third one and eventually kill it. Unless you have 180 gallons or so 3 oscars wont survive together.
Wt61EclRaa	Unless you are in a private fenced in area all dogs should be on a leash no matter what.|`|MKuDawP7aa	The most important reason for keeping your dog leashed is control. When youâre dog is leashed, you let him know that you are the one in charge and he should listen to your commands. And if they are unleashed then they are the ones on control and they might do anything they want like run away, fight with another dog or simply lie down. Dogs understand this concept. So for their safety, yours and others you should keep the dog on the leash when going out.<br>  <br>  The dog has to know that you have all the control and youâre the one who can tell him what to do and what not to do and he shouldnât be pulling you around. For this simple training all you need to do is walk the dog inside the house. Put him on the leash and walk around the house with him. If starts pulling you or getting excited about something stop walking until he stops. After doing this a few times he will stop and surrender to you because youâre in control. Now you can them for a nice walk and they will behave when theyâre leashed.<br>  <br>  You want to show your dog that youâre in control as well even if heâs unleashed or inside the house. He must be able to respond to your commands and your calls such as âGo out the houseâ or âGet in the houseâ. If you call your dog, he should come to you no matter where he is, whether heâs outside or inside because in case he runs away he will recognize your call and be able to come to you. There are dog training books that talk specifically about this topic. You want to be able to enjoy your pet without being angry at him or stressed. He should be able to respond to you leashed and unleashed. When you find the right training book about training the dog leashed and unleashed, your dog will know whoâs in charge.|`|bdB1jq21aa	if u don't live on a busy street just walk her up and down without the lead on and whenever she tries to run put her on the lead, make her sit and tell her NO but when she does behave give her a treat and she will soon catch on!! :)<br>  <br>  that's how i teach my pups before they're sold|`|d3MhQzrIaa	you definitely have the basics down.  now its up to your dedication, patience, and your dog, ultimately :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/dog_obedience_training" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/dog_obedience_tra...</a>|`|4fAikyfDaa	hi<br>  <br>  i found a very good dog training tips online<br>  <br>  check here<br>  <a href="http://dogtraining.6x.to/" rel="nofollow">http://dogtraining.6x.to/</a>
MstjbpVJaa	This is fallacy,Ostriches do not bury their heads ,in the ground or sand .<br>  So they breath through their nostrils.<br>  It is only an expression,that they bury their heads in the sand.|`|0e51HkpHaa	They dont do that. Its just a myth.<br>  When lying down and hiding from predators, the birds lay their heads and necks flat on the ground, making them appear as a mound of earth from a distance. This even works for the males, as they hold their wings and tail low so that the heat haze of the hot, dry air that often occurs in their habitat aids in making them appear as a nondescript dark lump. Contrary to popular belief, ostriches do not bury their heads in the sand.[22][23] When threatened, ostriches run away, but they can cause serious injury and death with kicks from their powerful legs.[17] Their legs can only kick forward.[<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich</a>|`|AA10834367	There has NEVER been (except on cartoons drawn by idiots) one single documented account where an ostrich has buried its head in the ground. Ostriches often dig their beak into the ground browsing for worms or insects, which is supposedly where the myth got started. Ostriches are not too intelligent though, when trying to hide, they will often stick their head behind a bush, leaving their body totally exposed. Scientists are under the assumption that the bird thinks if it can't see you, you can't see it.

IMPvzBk1aa	Actually you can use Hibiscrub which is considered by some resources to be a better choice than Betadine to kill the particular bacteria in rain rot, called dermatophilus congolensis. Note that this is a bacterial infection, and not a fungus as many people used to believe. Betadine or Hibiscrub can be purchased at a drugstore, and can be diluted with water to wash the area, and then be sure to thoroughly rinse it and dry it.  You should gently remove the scabs and leave the sores open to air.  The bacteria are anaerobic, so exposure to air kills them.  Your vet can give antibiotic injections which will resolve it faster, and is the best treatment if it has invaded deeper layers of the skin.  If the sores are bothering your horse, an ointment called EMT can be applied to the sores after the scabs are removed and the areas are cleaned and dried.  This promotes rapid healing while reducing pain and itching.  I haven't found anything better for promoting rapid healing...you can get it online or from tractor/farm supply stores....be sure to buy the one formulated for horses.  But no ointments should be applied until the area is completely dry and free of debris.  It isn't recommended to do any vigorous scrubbing or grooming of the area, which further irritates the skin and can spread the infection.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	beware, though, using iodine and betadine may stain your horses coat a yellowish color temporarily, i received a rescue horse that had rain rot, i had a little trouble getting rid of it, as the mare had it everywhere i would recommend daily baths, i used an iodine soap, also, horsemans dream fung-away spray worked really well|`|5TCewPYRaa	All right, so you probably cannot buy Betadine or Iodine from  Wal-mart...but you can get it from the vet or tack shops. <br>  <br>  The solution i use is 1/4 cup betadine in 1 cup of warm water.  First dunk a sponge into the sol'n and soak the affected area until the scabbies soften and you can peel them off gently.  Next using the sponge, scrub the area and about 2 inches surrounding it with the betadine for about a minute and then let it sit for about 5 minutes. Rinse Thoroughly with clean warm water and dry as well as  you can.  Do this 2 times a day--no more than that.  <br>  <br>  Dont leave the betadine on or it will burn the skin and dry it out. <br>  <br>  Betadine is just a brand-name for Iodine solution--like Kleenex? So it doesnt matter what you get, its basically the same product, maybe a few miniscule changes in--nothing huge. <br>  <br>  Make sure you keep on the scrubbing daily and once it looks like it has cleared up, continue scrubbing for 2 or 3 days after to make sure you have really cleared it up--it spreads very easily and will come back at the drop of a hat if you allow it to. <br>  <br>  I bought a 2 yr old last year who was kept in less than desirable conditions and he was COVERED in rain rot---both sides of his neck, all 4 legs, belly, chest...it was horrid--it took forever to get rid of....eek!
QtApqMKJaa	I would have to say no because the water will be to fast for a rat or rats  if it got too fast they could break part of the back bone a quick and small bath is fine but there fur will get a little messy and a bit hard to keep down but if they need cleaned give them a bath every month|`|Awo7g1K4aa	NO. Rats are delicate.  A single shower drop could probably break a bone.  Why don't you wet a rag and wipe it around the rat?|`|B1OUPWxXaa	NO!!!!|`|fnLbedPgaa	Showering your rat wouldn't break any bones (oh the thought gave me a good giggle though!) but I doubt even the calmest rat would sit still for one.<br>  <br>  To bath a rat, fill a sink with warm (not hot) water, hold your rat under his/her arms, and dunk their back end in.  Squeeze a tiny drop of puppy or rat shampoo (yes, you can buy them - check Ebay) onto their back and rub in, and around their tummy.  Alternatively you can add the shampoo to the water.  Rinse with clean water, and towel dry.  To get rid of staining on their tail, you can use a plastic scourer pad (not the metal kind) or toothbrush with some puppy shampoo on, sweep gently over their tail to remove any dirt - do not pull their tail though as it could de-glove.<br>  <br>  A good tip though is to clip their nails before you do this - or wear an old long sleeved top.  Have a towel over one shoulder so you can hold them against you to towel dry.<br>  <br>  If that is all too much of a hassle - you can also use baby wipes for sensitive skin to remove any dirt.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|m4nKkFDUaa	The force of the water would probably crush them. And they might drown if you blocked the drain.|`|vDINRJAfaa	Nope it'd probably kill the little thing.|`|BBABtcvCaa	Having your rats take a shower is a bad idea, but if they smell, then plug your bathroom sink and put about an inch of water that is just slightly warmer than lukewarm and use baby shampoo. After they are rinsed, use a hand towel to dry them off. They will still be a little wet but after you use the towel put them back in their clean cage. Most rats don't really like this so you have to be quick. Also it's very important that you don't get their head wet. I know this because I have had 7 rats. Hope this helps!
TLQsMu1raa	omg ha ha that sounds like something my friend would do XD. no they do not ask you for id its kinda like buying candy, as long as u have the money they don't care.Just act mature until you leave the store ha ha LAMO but ya they make you sign the papers at the pet store because its almost like saying "I will take care of this hamster until its death" so ya haha and its also a guarantee on the stores part, if u sign that and the hamster dies within 4 days they have to give you another one.<br>  so ya haha tell ur friend I said that was a hilarious idea, and it sounds just like my friend. lol btw if she does get the hammy tell her I said congratulations|`|4gC38fKsaa	you can just buy a hamster. they don't care as long as you pay for it. now they wouldn't sell you a puppy, but they won't care about selling a hamster.<br>  don't steal. even though its only $5, your parents could get called to the mall and you'd get a long lecture.|`|KYTTYhK0aa	It is not nice to steal, this what I always say if steal  you will end up losing double of what you stole. That's where I got my hamster and I did sign papers for the purchase. Try going to the small pet stores or try craiglist.org they were giving a free hamster.|`|jCnDVKo5aa	Honestly, it doesn't sound like either of you are mature enough to be keeping pets.  If it's really that much of an issue, why not have her parents take her to the pet store?|`|XtToOTmuaa	If you can just buy one, is it worth all the trouble of stealing one? Then you got to go though all that and then you don't get the hamster either. I think you know this. Besides if you girls like the mall, do u really wanna get banned and can't go in there anymore and then you got to tell ur mom when she takes you. Also before you get the hamster you have to have a home for it and food and water bottle otherwise it is going to get sick. Think about the poor hamster that you are going to love.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	you will get caught, i mean you will have to take the lid off the cage, then pick one out and if she manages that where will she put it. just buy one. ok so you have the money, pay for the hamster. just say 'i want a hamster out of that cage, is this enough'|`|sFASHCNRaa	umm...they'll let you buy a friggen hamster if you have the money. lmao. don't be a moron and steal one.<br>  <br>  you're buying a hamster, not adopting a child.|`|KBvkGc6baa	what i would do is ask  someone old enough to buy one if they will come in and get it and that you will pay for it|`|OFaImbSiaa	Hamsters are like $5<br>  <br>  If you get caught trying to steal one, you'll probably just have to pay $5|`|NJkVyydqaa	go out of the store and ask someone to be your prtend partent so they can sign the papers for you.|`|ct8MWxJOaa	dont steal one<br>  just buy one theres no law against it
LVZdzPmpaa	The patella is the kneecap. If your dog's kneecap is slipping out of position, it can be very painful. The dog will limp and modify his activities. If the pain or the incapacitation is severe, the dog might snap at someone who tries to approach him.<br>  <br>  There are a number of things that can be done to relieve the problem, including medication and surgery. <br>  <br>  My dog had this problem last year. (She's a very active Wheaten Terrier.) I kept her from too much rigorous activity for about a month. Eventually the problem resolved. We had one more episode of it later, but it was very minor. A friend of mine, on the other hand, has a Norwich that required surgery to repair the damage.<br>  <br>  So it all depends very much on the dog, his care and his activity. During the episodes, however, there is pain.<br>  <br>  Talk to your veterinarian more about this problem.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Please take no notice of the numpty who said dogs don't have patellas. He/she clearly doesn't have a clue what a patella is.<br>  Where do these people come from? Are they pre schoolers?<br>  <br>  To answer your question. With a grade 1 luxation the dog will feel some pain but probably not severe pain.  It will get worse however so you should discuss with your vet whether or not surgery should be done.<br>  Does the patella slip out and go back into place on its own?|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Wonky KNEES don't cause paws to "get stuck". Knees popping in & out are no big deal.<br>   & NO,bad knees aren't painful unless they're extremely bad & get long-time arthritic problems. <br>  Bad knees rarely require surgical intervention.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	is this the 4th or 5th you have asked this?  I have lost count.|`|0fygxRHLaa	dogs don't have patellas
oK5kVlrnaa	My dog does this occasionally due to her allergies. She itches at her paws that soon turn red. Check your dogs paw. Is it cut up? Is there any blisters? If any of these questions have an answer of yes, this is more serious than it seems. Take your pet to the vet. My guess is that he may be feeling a bit uncomfortable. But dont worry, as i said this could just be allergies!|`|JmD0oq2Naa	he might have something in his paw or he might have cut it. one of my dogs was doing that the other day with her front paw, she kept stopping and licking it, so i checked it and there was a small cut on it|`|5rfnEQnGaa	This is a common symptom of a luxating patellar, the dog hops for a few strides until the patellar re-seats.  If your vet says it is not painful, then I guess he is ok. Make sure he does not put on weight and try to sop him form jumping on furniture, etc.   Keep getting him checked at the vet.|`|dn96x5W1aa	Check out your dogs paw for any burrs or brambles.    If you see none, look closer to find if their are any scratches.  If not, just watch you dog for a while.  Since he hasn't stopped from yesterday, I would advise that if he doesn't quit bugging his foot by noon, take him to your local veterinarian.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  :D|`|So7lXdBKaa	he may have a splinter / thorn in his pad|`|NrWgXq1taa	i'd take him to the vet|`|lWQRe87Oaa	you  should take him  to the vet my dog had the same thing and it was a rash but my dog almost died from it.................!!
3zv2bbolaa	Luxating patellas are an inherited genetic defect of the knee, most commonly seen in smaller breeds and breed who have very straight stifles. The symptoms don't typically occur until the dogs growth has slowed at around 6 mths to a 1 year of age, but it can come on later in life. <br>  <br>  It can be caused by trauma to the knee or more commonly by inheriting the genes that cause the leg to be formed in such a way that the patella slides out of the groove that keeps it in place.|`|bIaywrBCaa	the condition usually doesn't show up at first. He probably had it all along but is just now showing up. There is surgery to correct this. Is it one knee or both?|`|Os6VjLH0aa	A lot of small dogs and dogs with very straight stifles have this problem.<br>  The best way to avoid further injury is to keep the dog from jumping a lot.<br>  There is no way to avoid it, since it is a structural-genetic problem, you say you got your dog from a "nice" place, but, the question is were the parents tested for luxating patellas, and were they chosen from bloodlines that are clear?<br>  This can be fixed with surgery, or it can be managed, ask your vet to show you how to manipulate the patella back in to it's groove. You might think about supplements to strengthen the surrounding ligaments too, talk to your vet about this also.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	A puppy should not have a luxating patella. If he does, it means he inherited it as a genetic defect from his parents. Before you bought the puppy, you should have screened the breeder to make sure they tested their breeding stock for common genetic disorders. <br>  <br>  Unless you had a good contract, there is probably no way the breeder will help finance the treatment or offer you another puppy. You will probably be stuck paying the vet bills and the inevitable knee replacement. <br>  <br>  Next time, do your research and only buy from a breeder who does proper genetic health testing.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	You keep repeating this type of question, how many times do you need an asnwer?

qdtU1Q1Laa	Most horses will back up when they are learning to bow, it just takes more time for some of them to figure out what you're asking them to do.|`|p0L0A4ysaa	Put her butt to a wall, so that she can't back up. This will make her have to put her head down.|`|12b2ae165a26d98cccbcd9cbb7c2f71aaa	With everything with horses, you need to do it in small steps.<br>  <br>  Use the treat to get her to just lower her head at first. Baby steps - trying getting her head lower and lower with several treats in succession. Once you are able to get her head straight to the ground with the treats, slowly start moving back toward her hooves, again with several small steps and several treats.<br>  <br>  Once you can get her head to her hooves without her backing up, try with her head to her knees, then gradually between her knees.<br>  <br>  This is going to take time - don't try to do it all in one day, or even a week. Take it slower than you may think is necessary, stop on a successful try and don't punish her for backing up, just withold the treat. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Lift one of her front legs up, while holding the treat low to the ground in between her front legs. She will have to bend the leg that is still on the ground to reach the treat. Slowly as she learns put the leg that you lift up on the ground, so she is kneeling on it. Also, face her head when you lift the leg, so she doesnt cofuse bowing with picking out hooves.|`|nYaos4N5aa	if you can get her to just put her head to her chest, then give her the treat a couple times, she'll get the point, than you can ask her to go further.|`|eXDDODfHaa	its so cool to watch a horse bow.
XGsuxRR2aa	Pretty sure you need to have a leash on him still, but yeah, it's a good idea to get him out and used to people and other dogs, especially the smell of other dogs. He is pretty young still, but should be fine. As long as he has had his shots, just in case.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	Not until it's had all it's shots for the first year.  Same goes for bringing it to a dog park.  8 week old puppies do not belong at a dog park.  Dogs play rough, and such a young puppy can't handle it.  It will be strong enough after all shots are done for the first year.  This should be at about 4 months old.<br>  <br>  And the animals are to be on a leash when in the store.  Or any other time when not in a fence or in the house.|`|IcYXQlf9aa	NO-  a more controlled environment like a dog training school would be better for socializing your puppy until it is 12 weeks old. After 12 weeks, most puppies have  developed immunity from vaccines(or exposure to vaccinated dogs) to protect them.  Places like Petsmart  and dog parks have no control over  the nasty things customers' dogs might be bringing in with them|`|25ENsqfEaa	You need to be very careful where you take your puppy.  Parvo is a deadly disease and your puppy can pick it up anywhere!!!  His immune system is still developing and you don't want to risk him getting sick.  Wait until your next set of puppy shots then give him a few weeks after that then you can start taking him to pet stores.|`|AzJ8t1ZTaa	Teaching your pup to be dog- and people-friendly is your most important job as a dog owner. It keeps people safe around your dog, and--since aggressive dogs are often put down--it keeps him safe around people.

Get it vaccinated first.|`|1b1nBk7laa	Yes!  It's never too early to start socializing a pup!  Make sure the dog is on a leash though.|`|lr94JacRaa	it is usually a good idea to socialize dogs at an early age that way they won't become phyco dogs|`|UmhWxs1laa	No, as the first shots have not yet kicked in.<br>  <br>  As a rule, my pups get shots at 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks.  Shots take 2 weeks to produce immunity.<br>  <br>  I feel relatively safe socializing at 14 weeks as the second set of shots have produced immunity by then.  I feel completely confident at 18 weeks that all is well, but it's a balancing act between immunity and early socialization.<br>  <br>  If you know of dogs that have had all their shots and are healty, that's my choice to start young pups socializing safely at an early age.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	not until it's fully vaccinated.<br>  that prevents problems for both your own puppy, and the other ones that might not yet be fully vaccinated.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	NO.<br>  <br>   Ask your vet or the breeder for the names of some other people who have puppies the same age - you want a small group of puppies you know are healthy and came from good circumstances to be near your dog.<br>  <br>   While PetsMart is a wonderful company, and does fabulous things for rescue, any dog can walk in there, meaning any dog from any puppymill or back yard breeder can shop there, dragging in germs your puppy has no defenses for as yet.  Not a good place to be!<br>  <br>    No puppy under 6 months has enough of an immune system to fight off the really bad things like parvo and lepto, and vaccine are not a magic bullet.  Your puppy needs to play with dogs you know well, that have a known history.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	No, your puppy should wait until it's 16 weeks old had all it's shots before going to places where other dogs do.|`|YRTYXfggaa	No!  Not until it's fully vaccinated!  Please!|`|KFu7596Paa	at his is i doubt hes had all of his vac <br>  so no wait  till hes had them much safer
JPa0GzDjaa	The gestation period of a guinea pig is 65 days. <br>  <br>  It depends on when she was mated.<br>  <br>  (If she was mated about 2 or so months ago she will be ready to pop sooon!!! Good Luck!)|`|SwlJJaT5aa	Be on baby watch! The gestation period is 62-70 days, which is about 2 and 1/2 months! Why would you want to breed your guinea pig? Don't you realize she could die? Might need a c-section? How old? If it's at least 8 month's old, a c-section is NECESSARY! She could die of pregnancy toxemia, if the babies are born late, then she could get poisoned, and then die! Also there is the possibility that she could make a successful delivery, but she could die of being over exhausted! Please leave babies to the proffesionals.|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	They will come when they are ready there is nothing you can do to make it any quicker you do not need to do anything to prepare just make sure her bedding is as clean as possible all the time and she is eating well if she stops eating this could indicate a problem so seek advice from a vet other than that its just a waiting game.<br>  It depends who has the stronger colour gene as to what they look like.|`|59zYV36Eaa	If she's getting pretty fat, she's probably close.  They are pregnant for 68-70 days usually.  They sure have some cute babies too!|`|foehXxYtaa	Usually, the guniea pigs take 2-3 months to give birth.

About the only good thing you might get off them is they are likely to deliver, but that's about it.  The knowledge of the chain stores here sucks big chunks and you'll rarely ever find a chain store with people that know what they are talking about let alone how to keep and raise and breed the fish they sell.<br>  <br>  Craigslist is a great place to start looking for bargains, and you can as well joins North Jersey Aquarium Society, <a href="http://www.njas.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.njas.com</a>  I recently joined a couple other forums that are fairly local and bought some fish from the people there.  <a href="http://www.eastcoastcichlids.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.eastcoastcichlids.org</a> and <a href="http://www.nycichlids.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nycichlids.com</a>  There are some great people in there, and they at least answer their email, unlike some users on this forum.<br>  <br>  The general question you are asking varies.  Availability of Oscars, shouldn't be any issue, but more or less the quality of the stock you are getting should be your concern.<br>  <br>  55 gallon set ups, could go from anywhere from 100-200 with all stuff you are talking about needing, but you can as well find a nice deal on craigslist or check the for sale ads off the forums I listed.<br>  <br>  The price on the stock, shouldn't be anything to concern about, it's a commonly kept fish so don't over pay.|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	New Jersey is the main import source for tropical fishes on the northern Atlantic coast. I know that this doesn't address your questions,but if you can find some of these importers you will find a lot more than a few Oscars. Also there are some great clubs/aquarium societies in the area, these will be great sources of information and livestock.
9kceDOTraa	David, you probably have done more harm then good.  You need to determine the root cause of these problems, and the cloudy eye for one is a problem.  This can be caused by either gram negative or gram positive infections and you need to use specific medications to treat this.  You cannot treat a gram negative infection with a gram positive medication and vice versa.  Narrowing down the cause is in your best interest instead of bombing the tank out with all these meds.<br>  <br>  If there is Ick this is fairly easy to fix.  A good dose of either Quick Cure or Copper Sulfate, and raising the temp up to about 82-84 should fix this problem in short order, but you need to find out what is causing the cloudy eye.  Try asking in a more professional forum, and I linked you to some of those in your NJ move answer.  I have to also say, you might want to not keep Oscars if you are having a problem like this and can't fix it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://everythingaquatic.proboards104.com/" rel="nofollow">http://everythingaquatic.proboards104.co...</a><br>  <br>  Get some pictures of this problem and post them there.

IJr0MR1Aaa	Yes that is a good formula.  Goats milk is much better to use than evaporated milk for two reasons.  1) Goats milk is more digestible for many mammals.  2) Goats milk has digestive enzymes.<br>  If you don't use goats milk, make sure the yogurt has digestive enzymes<br>  <br>  If pup can suckle from bottle, there is no need to tube feed.  Its better for the pup to exercise its jaws by suckling.  If he's too weak, tube feed.<br>  <br>  If you can supervise the pups every time they nurse, you can keep them from pushing small pup away.  If you aren't present each time pups nurse, use the formula.|`|ObUc4Sa0aa	Well if all the other puppies besides the one is getting milk from the mother just give that puppy formula and let the other ones stay with the mom till they eat hard food|`|6kIEYQSFaa	here is what i would do. I wouldn't try to feed it myself unless i am experienced. first i would try just taking the puppy who has gotten the most to eat away for a while and just watch as that one puppy get to eat. if he gets pushed, push them all around till he gets to eat. as long as the mom is still feeding it voluntarily, i wouldn't worry too much. one always gets bullied. if he starts getting skinny or isn't as fat as the others, then i would go to walmart, and get some puppy milk replacement. this would be best nutritionally. i would only use this though as a last resort. really try to let mom do it though, that would be best.
Os6VjLH0aa	You are doing the best you can. The groomer should have plucked his ears when he was groomed. It is VERY difficult to pluck a Bichon's ears as the hair is very thick in there. <br>  The best thing I can tell you is to get a different groomer that is not so judgmental. If you can't afford to have him groomed regularly ask the groomer if they will just pluck his ears once a month or so, shouldn't cost a lot and you might also have them trim his toenails while they are at it. I do a lot of peice-work like that for my clients, charge $5 for the ear plucking and $8 for nails. You also might want to have the groomer show you how to express his anal glands, this needs to be done on a regular basis also.<br>  Most of my Bichon clients come every 6 weeks, by doing these three things regularly you can avoid a lot of problems. Bichon hair is VERY difficult to keep groomed, if you are going to bath the dog yourself take a slicker brush and brush the dog out before you bathe it, then bathe, dry and brush again. Bathing without brushing just tightens the matts down and makes them "felt" against his skin. start brushing daily or everyother day now while his hair is short so you can keep up with it. Think about it, if you didn't brush you hair for a month then tried to brush it out in on sitting it would hurt, same with your dog.<br>  Hope this helps you, you are not a bad owner, you just needed a little advice!|`|xetVyGOdaa	Bichons are lovely dogs but they must be brushed for at least 10 minutes every day otherwise their hair gets out of hand. See <a href="http://www.bestfamilydog.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestfamilydog.co.uk</a>|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Pity they did not take him before he got so bad.  No point crying now, you needed to look after him better when you had him.|`|LwEwd7lcaa	Just tell them it wont happen again and take him to the groomer to cut hairs from his ear on regular basis.  not good to pluck them anyway it can irritate the ear canal giving him ear infection.<br>  <br>  sounds to me you love him very much.  just keep his coat short and this wont be a problem.  good luck|`|dn96x5W1aa	You sound like your trying your hardest to look after your dog, but the prior owners may not have left him in the tip top prime picture of health and may be trying to blame it on you and your "irresopncibility".  What they said was inaprpriate and immature.  I feel that as long as your playing with him, taking him for regualr check-up's and grooming, and feeding him, your doing great.  The quality that they left the dog in is their fault, not yours.  <br>  <br>  Take a deep breath, relax, forgive them for their judgementalness, and smile :D

Many dogs will put their life on line to defend their master. No pet will ever interact as much as a dog. When you come home from work, the dog will jump around, whine, run circles around you. A cat would barely acknowledge you by rising his head. Build a good relationship with a dog and it will be ever faithful and loving, displaying this in all situations.

With an overwhelming number of small dog breeds available, this may makes finding the perfect small companion a difficult task.<br>  <br>  Breeds of small dogs have a reputation for being excellent companion pets for someone living alone or for an older couple. This is because these types of small house dogs are happy and energetic, making them a great pet for a family, but are also small enough to do well in a small apartment because they don't require much exercise.<br>  <br>  Another benefit of small dog breeds is that they have an average life expectancy of 14-16 years. While some are prone to ailments simply because of their size, many experience less health problems than large breeds that deal with hip dysplasia, arthritis, or joint problems. Before selecting a small dog breed, you will want to do some research regarding potential breed specific health issues.<br>  <br>  Often small dogs, usually less than 15 pounds or so, are considered part of the "toy" or "miniature" group. Some small breeds like the Poodle, are actually a tiny version of the Standard Poodle. You may find some small dog breeds available in weighs as little as 4-6 pounds at full growth, while others will weigh closer to 14-16 pounds.<br>  <br>  Although there are great benefits to owning a small dog, you will need to be especially careful with some of the smallest breeds outdoors in the cold, as well as around other large dogs, as they are more vulnerable to injury. If you live in a cold climate zone and are interested in a small dog, you might want to consider small fluffy dog breeds, like a Shih Tzu or a Pomeranian.<br>  <br>  As well, just because these dogs are small does not always mean that they are instantly cute and sweet. Many small dog breeds, like the Chihuahua and Pomeranian, have a reputation for being temperamental, jealous and downright spoiled at times. Depending on the breed, some may also be difficult to train and housebreak, as they are often known for being headstrong to make up for their small stature. Before deciding on a small dog, you will also want to do some research, as some are better suited with children or other pets, while others may not be suited in these homes.<br>  <br>  Their benefits as pets far outweigh any downfalls and this shows as they continue to rise in popularity. They are wonderful family dogs, as well as easy going companions that are usually content doing whatever their owners do. Most just enjoy snuggling up while their owners watch a movie and many are content with a little romp in the backyard.<br>  <br>  Some of the most popular breeds of small dogs include...<br>  <br>  Chihuahuas: This pup is known for being fiercely loyal, as well as having a big dog attitude. Although this works well for couples looking for a little watch dog, Chihuahuas may not do well with children because of this loyalty and attitude. Because of their short hair, they will do best in a warm climate zone or where they can be kept indoors unless they are of the long-haired variety.<br>  <br>  Dachshunds: Most recognize the "wiener dog" right away and this has helped to make them one of the most popular small dog breeds in America. They are popular because of their fun and fearless attitude, a happy personality as well as being a great companion dog. Owners need to regularly exercise them and be careful of overfeeding because they are short and long.<br>  <br>  Pomeranians: This breed loves to be spoiled, so will do well with a companion that wants to make their pet the center of attention.They don't mind sitting on their companion's lap all day long, although they are known for being jealous. Poms are one of the most popular small fluffy breeds that have more bite than its bark, making it a great watchdog.<br>  <br>  Pugs: A sweet and lovable small dog with lots of energy, Pugs fit well with any type of family, although they will need regular exercise because of their tendency towards being overweight.<br>  <br>  Shih Tzus: Often referred to as the little lion because of their lion face and big personality,this breed commands attention and respect. Surprisingly, although they are long-haired and require regular grooming, Shih Tzus are actually considered hypoallergenic.<br>  <br>  Yorkshire Terriers: One of the smallest of the small breeds, Yorkies are actually pretty hardy and can stand up to a little rough housing. These dogs are extremely loyal companion dog that will usually pick their favorite owner, and have a tendency towards being jealous.<br>  <br>  These are just a few of the many small dog breeds out there, and if chosen carefully, both you and your pup will benefit with years of love and companionship.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Well from your other question.  You wanted a rodent type animal.  Something that was inexpensive and didn't require a lot of time since you were a student.<br>  So with you being a Student don't have a lot of time or money.  I highly suggest you don't get a dog.  Even a small dog is a lot of money.<br>  Shots, spay/neuter.  Whenever the dog gets sick take it to the Vet.<br>  Flea/Tick and worm preventive.  Toys, food/water bowls.  Food.  Collar, leash, crate, etc.<br>  <br>  And time:  House training.  Other training.  Play time, attention and they still need a little exercise, etc.  And dogs that don't get enough time with their owners grow anxious.  And they don't want to be caged up all day.<br>  <br>  So since you don't have a lot of money and time.  Don't get a dog.|`|OKHuaDAgaa	I think that it is your choice to choose, because many people thinks at a different way towards dogs. Some say a pug is very adorable, but I think it is very ugly, or some say a chiwawa, but I think it is too fierce and ugly. But I could tell you my opinion. I think a Yorkshire terrier is cute. They have a coat of blue and tan. Yorkshire Terriers are born black, gradually attaining their blue and tan coloration as they mature. <br>  The Yorkshire Terrier's coat is not coarse, but is fine and silky to the touch. Unlike other breeds, which have fur, the Yorkshire has hair that is growing constantly. They have no undercoat and do not shed. <br>  They are lovely lap dogs, lovable and playful. <br>  My neighbor has one and it is so cute and it likes to play at my lap and it licks me. So really, this is my opinion, and I found a website about dog breeds, you can find out more in there.|`|AzJ8t1ZTaa	<a href="http://dogtime.com/old-english-sheepdog.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/old-english-sheepdog....</a><br>  <br>  The Old English Sheepdog is a large, athletic dog with an unmistakable shaggy coat.

dSjWk2SPaa	Corn snakes are definitely the best beginner snakes. They are good eaters and usually have no problem shedding. They're also very docile and you will be able to handle them without any problems. Corn snakes can also get to good length without being dangerous. <br>  <br>  If you want a python of some sort, Ball Pythons are the best. However there are sometimes difficulties with shedding and they can be finicky eaters. Usually if you just let them soak in warm water, the skin will come off fine and offering them a gerbil might make them eat. Letting some blood out of whatever you feed them also might encourage them to eat. But ball pythons are known for going a long time without food, so don't worry if they refuse a meal once and a while. If they refuse to eat whatsoever, then they should be taken to a vet. On the bright side, ball pythons are very beautiful snakes and are very docile. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IXr1nmd1aa	if you are a begginer i would go with a corn snake but if you are more advanced i would get a ball python. hope i could help)|`|sSJ8zfebaa	not a ball python-they are a pain feeding and shedding,i have 6.corns are nice,i have 4.but my favorite is my california king.also have a great  mexican black king also|`|HCbgV86zaa	Ball Python|`|WSdYaOhOaa	Ball python or a corn snake both a good beginner snake corn snakes 5 and male ball python 4|`|TCwf6HXNaa	red tail python|`|i5MxtGENaa	it really depends on what type of snake you like the look of,. some people like corns , i have a couple and they are brilliant for begginers, and some people prefer the look of ball/royal pythons, i have a couple of them aswell.<br>  <br>  personally id say ball python as there alot more placid, and never bite you, when threatened they just roll up in a ball, hense the name lol<br>  <br>  good luck with your new snake

But no, their personalities do not "flip" as they get older.... shy kittens don't necessarily become playful cats and playful kittens don't necessarily become cats who don't like to play..... how they interact with you as they get older will be largely dependent upon how you interact with them as they're growing..... kittens who get lots of interaction become highly interactive cats..... kittens who don't, don't.|`|d92NcQBKaa	First of all: siamese are pains in the butt and they tend to be very michevious, loud, and have to be indoors...<br>  Second of all: Your friend's theory is not correct!|`|QQzX1NIFaa	Not from my experience.  I've had many cats, and have found that their personalities as kittens pretty much stay the same when they age.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	The Siamese kitten needs to be socialized. Wild doesn't equal playful and without proper socialization, this kitten will remain timid.  Sometimes timidness is a result of either a genetic heritage if the mother was a timid cat as well, or if the kitten was taken from it's mother too soon (before 10-12 weeks old). If these kittens are from the same litter, it's most likely a personality trait in the Siamese that will most likely continue into adulthood.  Since the Siamese is showing a bit of friendliness, some TLC will probably bring her out of her shell.<br>  <br>  If you can swing vet care for both kittens, it would be great to take both of them.  Kittens do much better in pairs.|`|TepAZAHyaa	I''m not sure overall but I did have an orange that tabby That was wild as a kitten then super mellow after a year or so  and right now I have a Himalayan that just turned a year in Dec. that is off the wall playful but was real shy and timid when I first got her last June. I attributed that to the fact that I believe she was abused and finally lightened up when she found out I wasn't going to hurt her.  On the other hand the tabby stopped being obnoxious when my ex punched him when he was about 9 months old and literally knocked his intestines out of his rectum. So it's hard to say with my experiences, a kitten with anormalal beginning may adapt differently. I did have a Siamese when I was younger that was just off the wall crazy, she would sit on top of the curtain rod in the living room and attack people she didn't know when they came into the house, she was very mischievious until her passing at 12 years. Anyhow I really think it depends on the circumstances, environment,and breed.  Good luck with your choice, I'd go with the Siamese personally.
znGpjsGjaa	You will not be able to hand raise these kits. they are too young. You seriously need to try and get the mother to nurse them. You do know rabbits only feed their young once a day, right?  You will need to make sure the kits are in a nesting box, place the mother in the box directly over the kits. Cover her and the whole box with a towel. Let the doe stay in the box for 15 minutes. Then check the kits to see if their bellies are round and they look full. If so then she has fed them. remove her to her cage and do this again in 12 hours. if she did not feed them leave her in the box for another 15 minutes. If she doesn't feed them this time remove her to her cage and try again in 2 hours.<br>  <br>  You cannot prepare a formula for kits that is equal to that of their mother's milk. I repeat these kits will not survive without their mother.<br>  <br>  Most does do not feed their young for the first time until 24 hours after they kindle, some does go 48 hours. Some does loose some of the kits. Seven kits is a lot for a Mini Rex to have.<br>  <br>  I hope you will heed my advice. I have been raising Mini Rex rabbits for 0 years now. I use this technique with first time moms and does that are stressed. it has always worked. I have never lost a kit with this method. If you take kits away form the mother they will not survive.
0TghwMJqaa	there are a lot of reasons why your cat would be scared. Although he didn't seem like it in the car ride.. he probably was.<br>  <br>  All the strange and different smells in the vet also make them very scared, and considering yours was adopted i'm sure it was even worse for him.. maybe scents he remembered from being in a shelter.<br>  <br>  I have three cats, all under the age of three and different breeds. My oldest is a DSH, my middle is a bengal, and my youngest is a munchkin/siamese.<br>  <br>  My oldest is okay at the vet. She's very scared, but kind of curls up and snuggles into me while they do their thing. <br>  <br>  My middle is a very timid girly to begin with so she's a little more anxious and wants to stay in the cat carrier. Once i get her out.. she'll nuzzle up to me while the vet does her thing.<br>  <br>  My youngest is a different story. She was fine when she was little and what not but when she was 9 months old, she got a hair ball stuck in her intestines. We took her to an emergancy clinic 20 minutes away where they poked and prodded her for some answers. They had no idea what was causing the blockage, so we said go ahead to the exploratory surgery when i saw her lying there in the cage all bandaged up and sick looking (i balled for hours). She didn't even want to see us, she kept turning the other way.<br>  <br>  So.. once they figured out it was a hairball and fixed her up she was a whole new kitty. The best 1500 dollars i've ever spent! She was the hit at the vet.. everyone loved her. They all said she was "slammed in the front and donked in the rear" lol (because she's a munchkin, with short front paws)<br>  Now when she goes to the vet, she cries, squirms and even tries to bite me or whoever is holding her.. though i can't blame her.<br>  She makes the funniest noises.. it sounds like "ah nom nom nom" kind of like growling with a load of food in her mouth. It makes me laugh every time, even if she is ready to bite me, lol.<br>  <br>  Something else you'll notice if you ever have another cat is when you take one in and not the other, when you get home.. the other will hiss at her because of the scent.|`|m16gf9mzaa	My funny stories are, luckily for the vets and techs in question, not quite so violent.<br>  <br>  My male cat loves to be held by the girls who are veterinary techs at our vet clinic.  One of his first visits there, he had to have a catheter (FLUTD) put in.  The tech said he climbed up onto her shirt, and at first she thought he was going to fight her, but then she realized he just wanted to be snuggled while she was working.  As long as she held him, he let her do whatever she wanted.  And he purred while she was putting the catheter in.<br>  <br>  I had a female cat who was pretty mellow.  One time the vet picked her up and nuzzled her in the middle of an examination.  He said she was so scared she was just frozen and letting him do whatever he wanted.  But while he was nuzzling her, she was looking at me with an expression on her face that said, plain as day, "Why is this strange man molesting me?"<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, since your cat gets so agitated, you may wish to discuss with the veterinarian using some form of sedative that you would give the cat a short time before bringing him to the clinic.  Pill Pockets might be useful for administering it.  <br>  <br>  I sometimes drop a few drops of Bach's Rescue Remedy in my cats' fur before an appointment, and I think it helps them a lot.  But I wonder if your cat might need a bit more help than that.|`|IuYekkPVaa	My previous cat was just like that and gained quite a reputation at the vet clinic and I have two bite scars to prove it.  When I moved abroad and took her medical records with me, I laughed when I read one of the entries which said "Attempted to take blood test - impossible.  Re-schedule patient for another appointment".  Away from the vets, she was the most loving and sweet natured cat you could ever wish for. I could never be angry with her for her reaction, as I have a phobia of needles myself and given the choice would avoid ever having another injection.<br>  <br>  The two cats that I have now are well behaved, which was a surprise to me because the female cat can be quite short-tempered when the mood takes her and is very quick to hiss her disapproval.|`|Uh6EV4wgaa	omg! they go absolutely mad!!!<br>  squirm and meow non stop~!<br>  its normalbecause they are in a new enviroment with othere animals and dont know wat its happeinig|`|xarKlp0Oaa	My cat will hang his whole tounge out the whole ride there. He usually ends up pooping all over the place while at the vets. Not a good experience.|`|FrojZ51oaa	i dont think my cat gets too scared.. other than the fact that he usually pees...<br>  ew|`|AvAuI1Kqaa	My male cat is usually fine.. Until it's time for his temperature. You can just see the look on his face going "That goes where??????" After that, it's claws out and anyone is fair game. The one office I took him to had three vets and one of them wouldn't even touch him. But everywhere I've taken him knows the proper procedure for handling a very angry kitty.
Wt61EclRaa	They are a highly intelligent working breed.  Please make sure you have the time to spend with them.  I believe they should live with a highly active family who does a lot of outdoor things.  Last thing you need is a bored dog.  That only leads to destructive behavior.  They are a pretty big dog. Have you owned and trained dogs before.  You need to be a leader with this breed otherwise they will take over.  I wouldn't rush into buying any dog.  I personally would look into a rescue group.  They are terrific and super supportive.  We adopt greyhounds and the people at NGAP are there for every single issue that comes up.  With a puppy you don't get that kind of support from anyone.  Just an idea.  If you do get one.  Please crate train...this avoid so many disappointments. Join an obedience training group.  Make sure to socialize your puppy often with stranger and other dogs.  Get it spayed or neutered.  Good luck!|`|AzJ8t1ZTaa	The German Shepherd personality is aloof but not usually aggressive. He's a reserved dog; he doesn't make friends immediately, but once he does, he's extremely loyal. With his family he's easy-going and approachable, but when threatened he can be strong and protective, making him an excellent watchdog.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/german-shepherd-dog.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/german-shepherd-dog.h...</a>|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	You've done ZERO "research" if you can't even manage to spell SHEP*H*ERD,as in HERDS sheep.|`|3UafIXyuaa	If you want a dog who... <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Is strong, athletic, and natural-looking <br>  Thrives on challenging activities and exercise <br>  Looks stern and imposing, so makes an effective deterrent <br>  Is exceptionally versatile -- when well-trained, can learn and do almost anything <br>  <br>  A German Shepherd may be right for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to deal with... <br>  <br>  An extremely careful search to avoid all the bad-tempered and unhealthy German Shepherds <br>  Vigorous exercise requirements <br>  Rowdiness and exuberant jumping, especially when young <br>  Destructiveness when bored or not exercised enough <br>  Aggression or shyness toward people in some lines, or when not socialized enough <br>  Aggression toward other animals <br>  Chasing and nipping at things that move: children, joggers, other animals, bikes, cars <br>  Constant heavy shedding <br>  Legal liabilities (public perception, future breed bans, insurance problems, increased chance of lawsuits) <br>  A multitude of serious health problems <br>  <br>  A German Shepherd may not be right for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If I were considering a German Shepherd... <br>  <br>  <br>  My major concerns would be:<br>  <br>  <br>  Unstable temperaments. German Shepherd Dogs are a dime a dozen, and most of them are bred and offered for sale by people who don't have the slightest idea of how to breed good-tempered dogs. Obedience instructors and behavioral consultants see LOTS of German Shepherds with neurotic behaviors, including aggression, biting, sharpness, and/or extreme fearfulness.<br>   <br>  Providing enough exercise and mental stimulation. German Shepherds MUST have regular opportunities to vent their energy and do interesting things. Otherwise they will become rambunctious and bored -- which they usually express by destructive chewing. Bored German Shepherds can make a shambles of your house and yard.<br>  <br>  If you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog running or hiking or biking or swimming, or to get involved in agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or schutzhund (protection), or herding, or tracking, or a similar canine activity, I do not recommend this breed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Providing enough socialization. Most German Shepherds have protective instincts toward strangers. They need extensive exposure to friendly people so they learn to recognize the normal behaviors of "good guys." Then they can recognize the difference when someone acts abnormally. Without careful socialization, they may be suspicious of everyone, which could lead to biting. Some German Shepherds go in the opposite direction -- without enough socialization, they become fearful of strangers, which can lead to defensive biting.<br>  <br>  Animal aggression. Some German Shepherds are dominant or aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex. Some have strong instincts to chase and seize cats and other fleeing creatures. If anything goes wrong in the breeding, socializing, training, handling, or management of this breed, it is capable of seriously injuring or killing other animals.<br>  <br>  Heavy shedding. German Shepherds shed only once a year -- for 365 days. In other words, they shed constantly. You'll find hair and fur all over your clothing, upholstery, carpeting, under your furniture, on your countertops -- even in your food. Frequent vaccuming will become a way of life. Make sure you're REALLY up for this.<br>  <br>  Serious health problems. From hip and elbow problems, to bone diseases and cancer, to stomach disorders and skin diseases, German Shepherds are one of the riskiest of all breeds in the health department.<br>  <br>  Legal liabilities. German Shepherds may be targeted for "banning" in certain areas, or refusal of homeowner insurance policies. In this day and age, the legal liabilities of owning any breed that looks intimidating and has a history as a guard dog should be seriously considered. People are quicker to sue if such a dog does anything even remotely questionable.<br>   <br>  <br>  Not all German Shepherds are alike! <br>  <br>  <br>  There are energetic German Shepherds, and placid ones. <br>  Hard-headed German Shepherds, and sweet-natured German Shepherds. <br>  <br>  Serious German Shepherds, and good-natured goofballs. <br>  Introverted German Shepherds, and German Shepherds who love everyone<br>  ______________________________________...<br>                                      Food for the dog<br>  <br>  Fresh food. Fresh chicken and turkey and beef. Fresh raw vegetables and fruits. Fresh brown rice and oatmeal. Fresh yogurt, eggs, and cottage cheese.<br>  This is not "people food." Calling real food "people food" makes it sound as though people are the only living creatures who are entitled to eat fresh foods.<br>  <br>  Virtually all living creatures thrive on real, fresh food.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>   <br>  At least feed a commercial dog food brand that meets ALL SIX of these requirements:<br>  <br>  <br>  All the ingredients have PASSED USDA INSPECTION.

My grandfather always told me King and German Sheperds were a one person dog. King never attacked my grandfather and was my grandfathers best friend until he came to the states. After that I do not know what happened to King, but he was a big full bred german shepard. Just remember they can be a one person dog.|`|AA11023739	We had a German Shepherd when I was growing up. They are incredibly intelligent, very loyal and very protective. I used to set assault courses for my German Shepherd and it would only take him 15 minutes to figure it out and he used to get into trouble with the local police man... nothing serious mainly for kidnapping bunnies but the police always knew where to find the reported missing bunny and they were always returned alive. Once she was accused of a crime which she didn't commit and taken to a dog prison quite far away, she managed to escape and find her way home. The local police man said that if it wasn't because he was retiring, he would have liked to take her in and train her as a police dog. Ahh... I miss my German Shepherd. They are absolutely super but you must only take one in if you have the time and space in your house. Do not have one just because your friend is giving one away. They require a lot of exercise, a lot of mental stimulation and a lot of training. I say a lot of training because they are very brave protective dogs so you need to show them where to draw the line. They are also good with children.|`|pyq6GF4taa	Go to:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshepherd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshephe...</a><br>  They have all kinds of info on german shepherds|`|AA11026827	I do have one, and I also help out at a German Shepherd Breeder's.  There are two things you need to know, Get one from either a good breeder or a rescue, your friends friend's dog is not guaranteed genetics or temperaments, and Backyard Breeder's often have cruddy dogs and the pups aren't great either.  Two, GSD are extremely stubborn and strong willed.  If it's your first dog, forget about it.  You need to have experience in handling and training before you get a GSD, they are not a dog for first timers.  I learned about them intensely for 4-6 years before I ever felt like I knew enough to own one (if you worked with one long enough, you'd understand that statement).|`|26PPwzrWaa	They are a working breed and can get bored very easily.

tG8tFRY8aa	When feral cats are hunting, they will sometimes make an odd "meow" of sorts. It can almost sound like quacking, because it consists of several quick noises. This person's cat makes such noises in this video: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=88545499171582527" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a> (this is not my video).<br>  <br>  It's completely normal.

Then he fastened it to the wall, by the window, so his three cats could get up there to look out to watch the birds!  They start howling and talking to the birds.  They'd also want to hop on my lap while trying to type on the computer.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	She probably doesn't eat the wet because she has a steady supply dry food available. Friskies is absolutely one of the worst foods you can feed your cat.  It is packed with grain fillers which contribute nothing to your cat's nutritional needs.  Dry food is the culprit in most cases of feline diabetes due to the high carb content and the lack of moisture.  Cats are genetically engineered not to drink sufficient amounts of water to keep their organs functioning properly so feeding a diet that supplies them with extra moisture is essential to ensure they get enough water. Some cats don't like the cut type wet food and prefer the loaf type that's completely ground up.  My cats do. Wellness is a top quality food you should look into feeding. Here is a good article on why it's important to feed your cat wet food.<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|TepAZAHyaa	I think 9 lives has it, it's more of a kibble in gravy type of stuff.|`|MHujoCWMaa	My cat is picky about canned food too.  After she licks up all the juice and walks away, I put a little water in her dish, a teaspoon or so, mix it around and put it back down.  It's even better when you use the water to rinse out the can and put that in the dish.  She circles back to it and often will eat the food the second time around.  She doesn't like the pate/ground up style foods at all.  Keep trying different brands, you may find one that she'll go for.|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	My cat doesn't like canned food either, i give her meat in gravy & there in like a pouch.

But they are w/o a doubt the most destructive  breed there is.  They just love to chew and play. Get rid of the brush pile.  Maybe keep him in a  kennel inside while you are gone. Give him a lot of time outside when you get home lots of play time.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	Here's my story on what happened with us leaving dogs outside when we weren't home.<br>  <br>  We used to leave my first two out, but one day our neighbor told us about a couple guys scoping out the neighborhood and looking at one of our dogs.  She caught them doing it.  Thank GOD for her.  She told us that dog fighters and puppy mills will take such dogs and no one ever knows what happened to them.  So we quit doing that.<br>  <br>  Only have the dog outside when you can be out there with it.  Get the dog a playmate and tire them out before you leave for work, again when you come home, and again before bed.  They'll keep each other company, so they won't tear up your house.  Bored dogs tear up houses.|`|LwEwd7lcaa	you can try to spray the pile with bitter apple.<br>  <br>  If your dog is messing up your house while your gone  the best thing to do is crate him.|`|7izZ17ncaa	firstly he shouldn't be kept outside, especially in winter, put him inside and clean up|`|5UZYoIEFaa	What he is doing is natural.

You can allow the active one to sit on your arms, crossed in front of you like a shelf, and let him keep moving back and forth.  I have had some like this, and they have learned to perch on my shoulder like a bird.  They like it and become very friendly.

8i90ov0Gaa	First off, your temperature is way too low. They need to be incubated at 90 degrees. They probably won't even develop at 83 degrees. Also, Hovabators were made for poultry eggs, and I like to slightly modify them for snake eggs by covering all of the holes on the top of the Hovabator with tape. The holes allow too much humidity to escape. When snakes have fertile eggs, they lay all of them at once. If it still has one egg in it, it's probably infertile. The stress from being caught and shipped overseas can cause the whole clutch to be bad. If one goes moldy, it is no good. Fertile eggs do not get moldy, only bad ones. And you don't need to spray the Hatch Rite,it comes out of the package ready to go. Too much water can be bad. Also, the way I incubate eggs in a Hovabator is to put them in airtight containers so no humidity can escape. opening the containers once a week allows enough fresh air for the eggs to survive since eggs need very little oxygen to survive. I don't even bother with water in the bottom or a humidifier.|`|i5MxtGENaa	dont worry your doing fine with it, its very common for snakes to lay a dud egg then a couple of days later to lay the healthy batch, so its all good :)|`|kSIxfA1Raa	You said, "Okay well I purchased a few gravid female ball pythons" so im going to assume that there is no male involved. If there is no male, then the snakes are laying "slugs" aka infertile eggs.<br>  <br>  you need a male ball python to breed with them or there will be no babies.|`|AA12197187	It was more than likely non-viable, i.e. a slug. Refer to the following blog entry entitled, "You've got ball python eggs but are they any good?"
9794VMZ9aa	In my pet shop, males are ï¿¡8 and females ï¿¡12.<br>  <br>  Just visit your pet shop if you are buying them from there. If you're not, you'll have to get it from a rat breeder, so it will be a considerably higher amount of money but for a better condition rat.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	i got my 2 males from pets at home for ï¿¡12, that was for the 2 of them|`|297f2uSgaa	about ï¿¡30|`|rLlQaoxFaa	Most breeders charge around ï¿¡10 per rat and only home in same sex pairs, but you may considerably more than this in a pet shop.  Reputable breeders dont charge more for different varieties, so a pair of dumbos from a breeder will usually work out much cheaper than from a pet shop.  It's a popular myth that breeders cost more - but they dont.  From personal experience, some charge less than the average too.  It may be worthwhile checking local rat rescues too - if you search for rat forums, you may find some useful links to rescues in your area.  Contrary to popular belief, rescue rats aren't always biters, and babies are very commonly found in them who have been handled from birth.<br>  <br>  Having said that - you also need to be prepared for cage costs (roughly ï¿¡40-70 for a decent cage for 2 rats, although you could buy second hand) - if you Google search for a rat cage calculator, it will help you find one big enough for rats (most pet shop "rat" cages aren't big enough for rats - you need something Savic Freddy sized for two rats).  Rats (especially pet shop or poorly bred ones) are prone to respiratory problems and mammary cancer - which will eventually cost a lot of money - some rats costing into hundreds of pounds for regular treatment.  Getting your rats from a good breeder will lower the risks of this, but there is still a good chance your rats will need the vets at some point - and with a consult fee averaging at ï¿¡15-20 before medicine costs, it's something to consider.<br>  <br>  Breeding from pet shop or rescue rats is not advisable, as they are produced on rodent farms or by backyard breeders - not bred for health or longevity, and you could bring a whole litter of sick rats into the world.  I recently lost a second boy from a litter born from a pet shop rat (not bred by me must add - doe came to her rescuer pregnant) - the whole litter had heart problems, and their deaths came far too young (one at only 9 weeks).<br>  <br>  If you are serious about breeding, you need to get much more experience keeping rats first, and then opt for healthy stock from an established reputable breeder.  Try going along to a local show - check out the NFRS site for ones near you.|`|aQCTR0Heaa	pets at home - 2 rats for ï¿¡12<br>  <br>  they do Dumbo rats, I love them :) and loads of other types, and all shapes and sizes|`|4uOWeRbtaa	I'm not from the UK but i might think it may not be more then 10 pounds. probably  like 4 pounds
oK5kVlrnaa	It wasn't too early. Your correct. it was the perfect time, and no earlier. Ok i recently got a puppy who is 4 months old. She walks great on the leash. By the way she does, i would guess you could walk your puppy at the age of 2-4 months. <br>  <br>  When potty training, expect to get frustrated!!! Right when you see her relive herself in your home, don't scold her or give her a spanking, just pick her up, and take her right outside to the middle of your yard where you would like her to use the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Also, she should have her own sleeping cage, right? In this cage i put a puppy pad, kinda like a diaper on the ground towards the back of the cage. Then put another lining the middle and the front. Also place some comforts such as a bone, blanket for sure, or a stuffed toy. The stuffed toy acts like another dog to snuggle up to. When you go to turn off the light, just leave a dim, cause as i found out, my dog is terribly afraid of the dark!!<br>  <br>  About food, i use purina puppy chow. This help build strong muscles and bones. It also makes their coat very shiny!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope i helped a bunch and i pray for your puppy to grow up stong and healthy!!!|`|0cf7e13d54e541838eb884911dd10263aa	He does need his shots first, and preferably on flea/tick medicine even though that's really not possible at such a young age. Wait until he gains better coordination... really the younger the better. Make sure you try and stay out of the grass, and more on concrete.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	You can take him for walks around your own yard.. You can take him for walks out in public once his vaccinations are finished.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	He can start going outside as soon as he's had his first set of shots.|`|CL5Plgekaa	Hello. You can walk him gently after his injections are complete. He can enjoy short walks about twenty minutes per day. At about 6 months you can increase this to half an hour. Puppy's bones are growing and too much walking can cause them to be deformed later on when he's older. To train him to do the toilet outside you can take him out often and reward him when he does the toilet. Any mistakes in the house just say no if you catch him doing it. Don't punish him if he messes in the house. They sometimes have accidents. The puppy should be fully trained by about 3 months. Good Luck.|`|AA11806718	He sounds a little young to be taken from his mother.  I suspect the people who gave your your puppy was in a money bind and would have given you the puppy without proper weaning.  <br>  He is too little to walk now.  You should probably call them and return him to his mother until he is at the very least 8-10 weeks old.  He is probably traumatized and wants his mama.  His mother lets him do his duty and licks it up for at least 8-10 weeks.  He is just too little to do anything with right now. Probably shouldnt get his 1st shots until he is 8-10 weeks along.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	if your in the UK he will have his first injection when he is 8 weeks old, then his 2nd 1 at 10 weeks then he can go for walks when he is 12 weeks. just start off with 10 or 15 mins a day. i have 3 golden retrievers, didnt take me long to house train them.|`|6qsocyK3aa	He's too young to be away from his litter, let alone to be taken out for walks. No puppy should leave it's mother and litter until it is 8 weeks old. If it does, it is at risk from behavioural problems and also its immune system may be weaker. Whatever moronic BYB sold you that poor pup should be reported to the authorities because that is nothing short of animal cruelty. <br>  <br>  A puppy cannot go on walks until it has had all its vaccinations and frankly, you should have done your research BEFORE you got your puppy. I'm sorry if I sound harsh but I have limited sympathy for people who don't because it's not just them that suffers, it's the innocent dog too!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just because he was weaned doesn't mean he was ready to leave. The first eight weeks are very important for your pup in terms of him being taught by his mother how to exactly be a dog. No one else will teach him! He could end up with behavioural problems because he will not of picked up on her behaviour for long enough.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but this breeder cannot be experiened and knowledgeable. If s/he was, she'd know it is ridiculusly irresponsible to let a dog go so young. It's like a taking a child from it's mother before old enough to talk.

Otherwise the dogs outsmart the owners.<br>  <br>  There are many intelligent breeds of dogs but sadly, few intelligent owners.|`|UZBl63blaa	To hear people say no dog is born bad just made bad by bad owners, simply isn't true. some are born with aggression,  due to breeding from aggressive parents. fact! no matter how many expert training wasted, to correct will do nothing if the dog has been breed from aggressive parents. Text book temperaments are there as a general guide, not every Alsatian will be a great guard dog as stated in books as every as every st bernard wont rescue you from snow as stated, every dog has its own personality, as i generalisation the above are not aggressive but good guard dogs and protectors and deter mind. does not mean guards are aggressive, confidence and balanced well socialised, none will be aggressive. if you mean which would be most dangerous if not balanced, then the answer is all of them would hurt you.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	No.  If they come from a proper breeding, and are raised properly, socialized well, and trained much, Rottweilers are not aggressive.  They do, however, have a natural guarding instinct that any owner needs to be aware of.  Again, that does not pertain to all of them, but some.  My one loves everyone, no matter what.  My other one is much more picky.  If there is something about you she does not like, she will be sure to let me know.  And, both of mine come from good bloodlines, so no worries about aggression, or them turning on me.  They know I am boss, I am alpha, and the yield, naturally, no fighting it.  <br>  I also do not think the other 2 breeds you mention are overly aggressive, but that also depends on how they are raised, trained, and socialized.|`|Zq1mWeIiaa	I was once told that statistically Golden Retrievers caused the most harm.

Rottweilers and Dobies are (wrongly) considered to be born aggressive because of their use in guarding, when raised in a loving home they show no naked aggression.<br>  <br>  Do look into dog psychology, you'll learn a lot regarding their behaviour and hopefully it will help to dispel some of the myths that you currently seem to believe.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Any dog can be aggressive if it is not trained, disciplined and cared for correctly. Similarly, dogs that are typically seen as aggressive such as pit bulls can be the sweetest family dogs ever. <br>  Yes, Alsatians, Rottweilers and Dobermans do have aggressive tendencies but if brought up well from puppy age and are not subject to abuse, they do not have to be. Alsatians, Rottweilers and Dobermans are often trained to be guard dogs because they are highly assertive and intelligent. This is where they get their fierce image from. But an abused labrador can be equally fierce.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	A well bred GSD, Rottweiler or Dobermann is mentally stable & not randomly aggressive.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately the Dobermann has a reputation for being a vicious and aggressive guard dog.

I would suggest a bottom feeder like a pleco (catfish found at fish stores).  They get along good with goldfish and clean your tank.  They live forever and do get big, but your tank will benefit from having one.  Go ahead and put the same gravel in, you should change the water, add additional gravel since the tank is bigger and store your fish in a bucket until your new tank is ready for them.  good luck|`|rSfoEyE3aa	Ok you have the tank you should scrub it down with warm water and nothing else also wash down the decorations and substrate.Install your filter to the tank place the water in the tank slowly after adding the decorations and substrate then condition the water leave it running for 24 hours with no fish in it what so ever .Then if you wish to purchase a test kit for freshwater fish you can but its oppition as goldfish are quite hardy .but if you want to purchase a test kit for ammonia and nitrite just test the water and make sure that bout tests rusults come to 0 if not you may need to leave the tank running for a bit longer with no fish in it until your test reachs 0 but the test is opitnal most poeple only test for these in warm water and saltwater aquariums then you can add the fish one by one and maybe add 2 or 3 more goldfish or coldwater fish of your choose to the aquarium hope i help|`|DU7iO8EHaa	You can fit 3 more goldfish in that tank. Its a huge tank. First you want to put the old gravel in the new tank. Then scrap off all the stuff from the old filter cartridge and put it on the new filter cartridge. And get some bio-balls or some sort of media for your filter. Then add water, conditioner, and stress zyhme. Wait about two days and test all the water levels. pH should be around 6.5-7.5, ammonia should be at 0, nitrites should be at 0, and nitrates should be under 60. Then you fish will be fine. If you just put in new gravel and new filter media and cartridges, then it will take about 1-2 months. I suggest the first idea.

At best they only delay the inevitable. Also algae is only part of a Pleco's diet,they require driftwood in their bill of fare and will consume a surprising  amount of it over the period of a year. They are interesting fish,but they are no substitute for regular water changes and proper tank cleaning. Unfortunately that's your job.<br>  Here's the simple rule,if you put anything in the tank(except water,which evaporates) it stays there in one form or another until you remove it. The sooner you figure out the implications of this statement the healthier and "happier" your pets will be.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	There's no pleco that'll fit in a 10 gallon tank.  Even the smaller plecos that stay in the 4-6 inch range should have a 20 gallon tank as a minimum.<br>  <br>  Plecos will help scavenge the bottom of the tank for uneaten food, however they shouldn't be used to rely on for cleaning the tank of algae or food.  First, they clear out the algae pretty quick, so they must be fed a supplement everyday so they don't starve.  <br>  And, they will add to the bioload in the tank with their own waste.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to scrub the algae yourself, and do your regular gravel vacuums/water changes every week, changing 25% of the water.  If you really want something to help with the algae/uneaten food, a snail or two would be fine for your tank(depending on the type of fish you currently have as well).  But again, don't rely on it to do the cleanings for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|XE1n7gRwaa	yes, they eat algae, what ever amount they can find. also i heard they can also bottomfeed if there's no more algae. they are a good cleaner fish. <br>  what type of fish is in there now?|`|f8RBtCVAaa	instead of a pleco i think a siames algae eater fish would be a tad better.|`|HZtzPXj4aa	ya but they make alot of waste
Y5FyAekkaa	Your still probably a long way off from being able to take her to the vet or snuggle in your bed but it sounds like you've made good progress. Remember that FOOD IS YOUR FRIEND. Make sure she sees you put it out or refill it. Never demand affection from her while she's eating. Right now she is living off the basic instincts of survival so her focus is that next meal. You can also try to coax her into a garage or barn where you can isolate her to help her get used to you. Often times feral cats never make the full turn around to house pets but I think its great your making the effort.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	No, just keep going as you are doing.  She may always be a skittish cat but if you can handle her a little, she's moved from feral to what is considered "semi-feral" so she is one of the rare ones that has made progress as an adult - many don't after they are past the kitten stage.  A truly feral cat would never willingly never allow a human to touch it or even approach it closely (though may eat food provided for it).|`|IRaIxWJKaa	She's trusting you but not any other humans, so feed her and keep up the contact.  Bring her indoors if you can.<br>  <br>  We adopted two outdoor cats like this and are working on a third.
1wHuhyPFaa	Keeping your cat indoors doesn't mean you're keeping him in cotton wool, silly :).<br>  <br>  It'd be nice for him to be able to go out in your back garden with you, some fresh air won't hurt him, but personally, I wouldn't leave him unattended. Sometimes cats are very afraid of the outdoors & any abrupt movement can send them flying into the next yard. I don't think it's natural for them to never be able to feel grass or dirt under their paws, like some people have said, it IS in their nature. However, I feel far too strongly about my cats to ever give them all the freedom possible. I'd never forgive myself if I lost a cat to an outdoor accident, nor would I ever let a cat out of my sight again. They point of them being a pet is to be looked after & cared for.<br>  <br>  If I answered this question a month ago, I'd be a lot less weary, but I found my 4 1/2 year baby (literally, my heart) passed away in our neighbors yard about a month ago. Granted, he did have a heart murmur & literally was as peaceful as could be (he was in the sun in his favorite lounging position) it still broke my heart to pieces, naturally. None of our other cats were as indoor/outdoor like him, I still made it a rule that no cats will go outside anymore. I can't help but think that maybe if he hadn't gone outside, he would have been around. Which is silly, he was literally aching to get out, sitting by the door, crying, whining, he slipped out when my dad was locking up & when I found him 2 hours later, rigor mortis was already completely set in.<br>  <br>  Sorry for my long response, just explaining my stance on it. I'm sure you'll do whats best for your cat :).|`|p1gzHgAraa	i understand your fears. i have 2 indoor cats and they are not allowed out-they would not know how to cope with being outdoors and dont understand that cars=dead. <br>  <br>  what i would do is get a cat leash! when you are ouside just get a stake in the ground and put her on a long leash so she can enjoy the sun and outside while you are out too.. but only do that if you are out with her. also, you will need to get her flea/tick medications (like frontline) if you are taking her outdoors..|`|CvwqocQNaa	I highly suggest keeping your cat indoors. I have three cats and keep them all indoors. There are a few good reasons I go by.<br>  1. If your cat gets out, there's a good possibility that he could eat any number of plants that are poisonous to cats (and believe me, there are a lot).<br>  <br>  2. My neighbors have an outdoor cat, and said cat got into a trash can and must have found some food in a metal can and he slit his tongue open on a serrated tin lid! And, he had to get stitches for it!<br>  <br>  3. If your cat's already 10 years old, he'll have a much longer life expectancy inside (life expectancy for outdoor cats; 13-15 years).<br>  <br>  4. Not all cats are street smart. You always run the risk of your cat possibly getting hit when you let him out. House cats are fast, but I don't think they can outrun a car going 60mph that comes out of no-where.<br>  I wouldn't suggest letting your cat in the garden, for reason number 1, and because, if he saw a squirrel or bird he could chase it out of the garden. If you're planning on putting him on a lead, don't. He will just slip right out of it.<br>  <br>  One thing you could do, if he likes to eat grass (as most cats do), just bring some untreated grass in for him every once in a while as a treat.<br>  Also, if you have any glass doors or windows, you could set up a perch for him to look out of. Kitty cats love looking out windows. It's like their TV. Just make sure he gets enough play time and attention to make up for it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|XtToOTmuaa	I think if there is a chance that your cat would run on you, you could put him on a harness and walk him like a dog. I had a friend that did this. That way he is safe. It may take awhile for him to get used to the leash. If you are out in the garden, make sure that there are no cat toxic plants that he could eat and get sick. I think indoor cats are the best. I lived on a farm and had cats outside. I think they get sick more often, are skinnier and prone to other animals and diseases. I know what you mean on them wanting to get out. Maybe you could invest in a window sitter for your cat. So he can lay in front of the window to get sun and look out. Congratulations on your new baby!|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	I have an indoor cat that we never let out doors. I was just to afraid to let her go. We live in a neighborhood where no one slows down so I'm afraod of her getting hit. Shes fatter than the out door cats but shes healthy and safe.

It`s cruel.<br>  The term `indoor cat` is a contradiction in terms.<br>  <br>  My own cat was a stray, and was half-starving when I took him in.  But....he had got so used to being outside (albeit no one was feeding him) he now seems to prefer it.<br>  Luckily he never strays from my back-garden, even if he is out all night.  Fed and looked after well, most of them won`t wander far.  The young adventurous (unaware of danger) cats will wander more.|`|WKgvwCNZaa	Lol, I think that you shouldn't worry too much about your cat.

m16gf9mzaa	She's been spayed, right?  If not, she may be experiencing a lot of hormone-related agitation from cycling in and out of heat without getting pregnant. Getting her fixed now could help calm this down. If she has been spayed, then here are some other suggestions.  Bear in mind that your cat is still a kitten, even though she looks like a mostly-grown cat by now.  Kittens have 3 settings:  eat, sleep, and 90 miles an hour.  In my experience, this youthful high level of activity lasts until about 2 years of age, give or take a few months.  As your cat matures, she will spend less of her time zipping around the house, or trying to play aggressively - where a kitten will play for 30 minutes to an hour at  a time, several times a day, a grown cat, even my eleven year old cat, will still spend 5-15 minutes a couple times a day playing madcap cat games.  <br>  <br>  One thing is, she may simply be so sensitive that stroking her overstimulates her - can you watch for signs that she is getting uncomfortable, and stop before it gets too much?  Or instead of you deciding to stroke her, wait for her to signal she wants physical contact. I have one cat who shrinks away from being stroked along his spine, but LOVES to have his chin and neck rubbed.  The other cat, when she gets stroked all the way down her body - well, I'm pretty sure she likes it, but it overstimulates her so that after a couple strokes she runs across the room.  Then she runs back.  Two strokes, runs away, runs back, ad infinitum.  She's a long haired cat, and brushing her is hilarious, but a bit of a challenge to do a good job.  Sometimes when I reach down to pet her, she hops up on two legs to rub her head into my open hand.  So from my experience, I think it would help to pay attention to your cat's body language, to see what her tolerance level is.  <br>  <br>  If it's not the hormones, and not the overstimulation then maybe planning to wear her out with play might help.  Yeah I know, she's already got a million toys, right? Try putting away all but a few, and then rotating them every few days so they seem fresh and new.  And don't forget to give some things to hide in and climb on, like a nice climb-able cat tree (I recommend the kind wrapped in sisal rope over the carpeted style), a paper grocery bag, or a cardboard box. If money is short, you can make a tree yourself - my boyfriend made one out of scrap lumber, 6in diameter pvc pipe, and some sisal rope; I'm not that handy, but I have made some kitty fun houses by gluing strong cardboard boxes together and cutting holes in between them so the cats could climb around, attached some burlap to one side for something to scratch at, and put a few toys inside. Give a couple of different bags or boxes at a time, so s/he can dart from one to the other.  There are toys that are made to dangle from door knobs or from the top of the door.  Catnip pads are great, too.   Try one of those toys that drop treats as the cat plays with them.  Consider changing how you feed kitty - instead of food always at one location, what about putting several small portions in different locations, for her to explore, hunt and find.    Don't forget the value of birdwatching - if possible, put birdfeeders outside of your cat's favorite sitting-windows - instant CatTV.  And don't worry too much if squirrels get to the birdseed - squirrels are fun to watch, too.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	every cat ive ever had ive kept in for the first year and had them spayed,all they have done is hang around the garden not once have they ever gone into the street or attempted to cross a road|`|HvbIE03saa	If she bites (an aggressive bite, not just a play bite) then bop her on the nose and give her a firm "NO!" so she'll learn that she's not supposed to do that. If she's acting up around the house, you can get a squirt bottle and spray her - it'll keep her from doing things she shouldn't do.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that she is young and does get a build up of energy that she has to run off (all cats do). There's nothing wrong with a feisty cat or one that runs around a lot.<br>  <br>  As long as you follow through and discipline, the bad habits should go away eventually.<br>  <br>  Good luck : )|`|epBOAXUraa	has she been neutered.  if not this change in personality could be due to hormones.

Is there any reason you can't find the cat a home with someone who can take care of it?  You need to do more than just figure on attacking it when it comes.  The cat needs people, he's doing his best to get a new owner.  You can't fault him for that.

It repels by both taste and odor, has a lemon scent.<br>  <br>  Every animal responds differently to each of these. Some will not be phased by them and others will be quite revolting.<br>  <br>  For training purposes they are applied on items that are to encourage avoidance behaviours and not for use with a squirt bottle as they could harm the eyes or respiratory system. Test each substance and observe to see which works as a deterrent so that accidental injestion does not occur as some could then be fatal.<br>  <br>  Coleus plants can be effective, but every cat responds differently so it is uncertain without experimenting.<br>  <br>  Many people believe mothballs work, however they are considered toxic and should be avoided.

All you need to do to take care of them is refill their food and water every 1-2 days, refill their hay container (bowl, or feeder) every day as much as you want, and guess what! They are one of the most hygienic animals ever! They only stink if you keep their cage uncleaned for over a week, cause the smell of the bedding sometimes rubs off on them! Also, you can tell how their feeling! Here are some translations-<br>  Bloop Bloop- HAPPY!<br>  Grrrrrr Grrrrrrrrrr- Annoyed/ Stop now/ Get away from me<br>  Chatter Chatter- Angry<br>  Squeak! Squeak!- Really scared<br>  Chut Chut-Noise they make when running around<br>  WHEEK! WHEEK! WHEEK!

3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Most likely it's ammonia poisoning.  See link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/disease/p/ammoniapoison.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/diseas...</a><br>  <br>  Do an immediate partial water change.  Then, if it's a newly set up tank, you'll need to do them daily till it cycles see link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  It's also possible it's an internal bacterial infection, septicemia.  However, I would suspect ammonia poisoning/poor water quality to start until you can rule that out before trying to treat an infection.  Water quality is usually the main cause of problems.  <br>  <br>  It'd be more helpful if we knew more info<br>  tank size<br>  how many/what types of fish<br>  how long's tank been set up for<br>  how often do you do water changes<br>  is the tank filtered<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|XE1n7gRwaa	i dont know very fish about fish injuries, but im thinking they may have been sucked into the filter. im sorry, but i don't know what to do about it....<br>  just see how they act for the rest of they day.<br>  maybe the fish were fighting eachother, how big is the tank?|`|q50zo922aa	First of all, what size tank do you have? A 30 gallon tank is a minimun tank size to house gold fish. Also, has the tank been cycled. If the tank has not been cycled, ammonia and nitrite will spike because the beneficial bacteria has not been established. To cycle the tank, leave the tank for 2 weeks and then slowly stock the tank. Your fish could have been poisonied with ammonia and to check if that is the reason, use your test kit and check for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. If it reads danger level, change 50% of your water and don't add any more fish or feed the fish until the water quality reaches a better quality. If water quality is not an issue, it may be a disease outbreak. Add a little aquarium salt to the water to ease the wound. I would suggest you to treat the tank with some antibacteria medicine which you can buy at any petshop. Be warned medication destroys beneficial bacteria if it has been established so I suggest you to transfer a fish to another tank and medicate them. If you don't have a spare tank, take a cup and add medication to it. Net the fish and dip it into the medicated cup. Dip it for about an hour and add the fish back to the tank. Make sure the water quality from the dip is the same as the tank or it will be stressed. Repeat the procedure as necessary. You could also feed medicate food instead. Hope this help.|`|AA11708471	Sounds like septicemia caused by bad water quality.|`|AA11901352	First off how long have you had your fish and is your tank cycled?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  More than likely There is an ammonia spike going on in the tank.  Have you tested your water?  First course of business here.  You will more than likely need to do a 25% water change to lower the toxic amounts in the tank.<br>  <br>  The red patches are from ammonia burns which will eventually turn black then back to their normal color (don't expect that to happen over night it will take time.)    There is no treatment other than good water quality.  It is important to keep your fish on a weekly 25% water change and monitor the toxins (ammonia and nitites ) in the water.<br>  <br>  You need to test and change water.  It wasn't the filter.

3n73f2Szaa	Yes, guinea pigs should have company.<br>  <br>  The difficulty lies in getting Hamilton to accept a new piggy. He may be aggressive to another male. The best chance is getting a baby, 6-8 weeks old. Hamilton may be so pleased to see company that he accepts him ,and won't see a baby as a threat. Put in a narrow tunnel for the baby to hide in if he wants. Make it too narrow for Hamilton to get in.<br>  <br>  I have two adult males who live happily together, and a third who will fight and who has to live in a cage alongside where he can see and smell and hear the others but not touch them.<br>  <br>  Get the biggest cage you can - the more space they have they less they will argue over territory.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|q0avHwvWaa	I can't say much about this, but if you are looking for a big cage I know where to find it. Coroplast and organzing cubes! Go onto google.com, images, and type in "guinea pig cages". Pick the first picture that comes up and go to the website it is from. It s simple and cheap. You can make the cage as large as you want with two stories and everything! It is the best thing I ever did(for my ginea pigs)!lol|`|zoPxgUsRaa	guinea pigs should def be kept in pairs, they are very social animals.|`|aiIS83Onaa	Nurture him quickly!|`|Em2TJrILaa	Guinea pig's love company. I have guinea pigs and sometimes when the guinea pigs get close to each other they make the cutest purring noise. <br>  <br>  However you should be careful. If your guinea pig is male and you were to get a female guinea pig then there's the risk of having even moreguinea pig'ss and sometimes (not always) male guinea pigs can fight if they are not used to each other from a young age. I have three male guinea pigs in a cage together and they are fine because they are all used to each other from a young age. If you decide to get a male companion for your guinea pig you will need to keep an eye on thebehaviorr between the two.<br>  <br>  If your cage is quite big now then it might be fine for both of them. However I wouldrecommendd going to Pets at home. To look at the different size hutches and ask a member of staff what they think you should get:<br>  <br>  My cage which I have two female guinea pigs in roughly about 3 foot across and about a 1.5 foot high and they are happy in that and the cage I have three males in is only slightly bigger and they seem happy. But you should also get a run for them so they can have more space ideally on the grass.|`|OrvTG44laa	Yes, guinea pigs need to live in pairs.  To be happy and healthy, they need a friend.  They are herd animals, so have a natural need to be with other guinea pigs.  I'd suggest getting a spayed female, because males will fight.  Two guinea pigs need at least 10 square feet of space to live in.  If your cage is 10 square feet, it is totally fine.  If it's not, however, you will need to buy a new one.  I am pretty sure you could make a cage for much cheaper however, and it probably isn't that hard.  <br>  Guinea pigs will be happier when they live with another guinea pig.  They will also be more socialized.  Happy, socialized animals tend to be less aggressive than sad, unsocial animals.
3a3e8iAcaa	My instructors Quarter Horse Ace used to do similar things to me for a while. Access what you did to her. If it is honestly from your crop, I would put that away and NOT even get it in her view until she trusts you. <br>  <br>  Approach her with an open heart and take it easy. If I could I would come out to see what is wrong, but I am unaware of where you live. <br>  <br>  Again, just try to take it easy and I wouldn't get a crop near her for a while and I definitely would try to establish hierarchy between the two of you again. If you go too long an allow her to do the things she is doing she will believe she can do it whenever she doesn't want to do what you ask. If you have discipline Lucy, I would use your hand ONLY and smack her butt. Try to praise her more for being good too. Even when Ace does a simple thing like lift up his hoof for me to clean it, I make sure to pat him and tell him he did good.|`|HQn0Fm6caa	You need to join up with your horse. It is when you take a lunge line, and have your horse canter, until he/she gives you some sort of sign with his mouth that he is ready to stop. You go over a take the lunge line off and turn your BACK AWAY from your horse and take a step, your horse will follow, because there herd animals. You walk around where ever you want and your horse has more than 100% trust in you, and once you ride, it`ll be like you the rider and your horse are 1.|`|5fpKb2aIaa	Leave the crop at home and show more self confidence.  Talk to her constantly like she is your best friend, world events, shopping, anything.|`|3rt8oKIzaa	Just have confidence. You might of done something that made her not trust you. Or, she may just be moody. I just went to see my horse yesterday, and he was an angel. He is really good when it is warm, but not when it is cold. Since you got her in July, you may have not been able to experience all of the different seasons, and how she reacts to them. If this isn't it, try getting her a trainer. It sounds like she ia a little dangerous, so you may want her to be worked on by someone experienced. For now, just be patient, and watch yourself. <br>  Good luck! ;)|`|eXDDODfHaa	sometimes horses get that way. when they havent been riding all winter long they get spring fever. which makes them crazy and hyper|`|dBRxfRGqaa	do ground work, don't even think about riding until your horse trusts you. it's a lot harder to gain trust when you are on a horse's back. don't lunge, either, that does not gain trust. i'm a natural horsemanship enthusiast, so i would recomend looking into natural horsemanship. you will gain trust really fast.|`|nYaos4N5aa	i don't think its a trust issue, it sounds like shes is just fresh and hyper. try lunging her before you ride, or at least warming her up a lot before you ask for canter. and not standing still is normal, you'll have to school her in it more.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	Your horse has had significant time off and doesn't want to work.  Even though you had a brief period of acceptable performance from her, it doesn't sound like she is broke.  Do ground work with her, get control of her feet.  Teach her to stand for mounting.  Teach her to bend and flex and to respect your space.  A disrespectful horse is a dangerous horse.  If you know a horse is going to rear and buck, DO NOT GET ON.  Getting hurt is not going to resolve anything.  Make sure she does not have an physical problems to cause her behavior.  If she is OK, get some help if you are not comfortable in helping her learn correct behavior.  If you can't control her feet, you will never control her mind.  Good luck.|`|xp6UVyj2aa	I wonder if she might have problems with her legs or feet. Raffee has problems with his knees and anytime he trys to move faster he bucks and kicks. Before we knew about his problem when we would try to mount up he would prance off to the side as well. As for the incident with the crop the only advice i can give you is don't use it for a while. But i would have her legs and hooves checked. And also give her time, don't ride her for a while and just spend time with her, pet her groom her, lead her around the pasture with a halter and lead. Give her time and talk to the farrier I'm sure with both of those things she'll come around. Be confident around her if she can sense you are scared or confused she will feed off that.

V4OpQF0caa	1 Getting rid of them is keeping the area well cleaned. U need more water movement, maybe a power overhead or jet pump.. they're not harmful if there's not a lot of them- buy a few little fish, the little fish would eat them. The worms are tiny so the big fish can't spot them or reach them.<br>  <br>  2. You can get rid of them, when changing the water use a cloth (bounty) and wipe them off. Buy a jet pump or something that would create more water movement. This can help with circulation.<br>  <br>  3. Don't flush them, wipe them up and dispose through garbage can because they live under cold or hot water temperatures, and they multiply fast.<br>  <br>  4.yes<br>  <br>  5.yes. but this is caused when you over fed your fish too.|`|aWEybdDFaa	Its safe to dispose of these worms in the environment. They're not hazardous to fish. They can be eaten by mollies, clown loaches, and angle fish--I doubt it if these fish can survive in a pond.<br>  <br>  Feed your fish every other day, part of these worms existing is over feeding. Most people wipe them off tanks and/or vac them off tanks. However, they love to live inside the filter. <br>  <br>  Try to find smaller fish that loves to eat worms, so you can control the amount of worms u hate to see.

F4IjI9qaaa	I'd skip the vet if fleas are the only issue. There are several natural flea shampoos and sprays you can get at pet shops. They'll have things like clove and other spices in them. They're ok - not great - and your little friend will smell like a spice rack. <br>  <br>  When you wash him, make sure you start at the head. that will help chase the fleas back and off the tail rather than forward and into the ears where they'll just hide out a while. (I always use tearless baby shampoo on the face and then change to flea stuff on the neck and the rest of the body.<br>  <br>  Vacuuming at least once a week is the absolute best way the control fleas in the house and on the dog. Pay close attention to the carpeted areas against the baseboards. This is just as effective as using "bombs" which spray nasty stuff all over everything - not just the fleas. Sprinkling Boric Acid on your carpet first helps. Make sure you throw the bag outside when you're finished.<br>  <br>  Depending on the type of fur your pup has, flea combs can be quite effective too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4540608_use-boric-acid-killing-fleas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4540608_use-bori...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Frontline is a very safe product.It doesn't go into the system but rather stays in the oil gland & hair follicles.

Frontline works within 24 hours!  Make sure you read the directions for proper use.  After you put it on, vacuum your entire house, wash all toys, beds, blankets, etc. in HOT water, and if you can and have the time, use a fogger in the house.  They are hard to get rid of, but with all the right tools, your house can be rid of them in a few days!  Good luck!|`|AzJ8t1ZTaa	Fleas are not only annoying, they can harm your dog's health.

Do not wash your dog for another 3 days at least.<br>  Give sentinel on day 1 as well - this is monthly.<br>  Wait 1 month - frontline your dog and sentinal<br>  Bomb your house.<br>  <br>  Repeat in another month.<br>  <br>  What you are doing is:<br>  Capstar kills the fleas currently on the dog.  Others can jump on!<br>  Frontline works through the oil glands in the skin.  Very clean dogs = frontline doesn't work.  Therefore, use 3-4 days after bath, and wiat a few days before next bath.  Through capstar you keep your dog more comfortable by removing flea load each day, then frontline can work through the oil glands in the coat.<br>  <br>  Sentinal works a different way -- it keeps the flea eggs from forming right.  Disrupts the breeding cycle.  Fleas are breeding in your house and you must stop it.<br>  <br>  Bomb takes care of current adults -- not eggs.<br>  Bomb again in a month kills healthy hatching eggs!<br>  Sentinal stops any new eggs from developing.<br>  <br>  Frontline keeps new fleas off your dog and keeps the dog from bringing in fleas from outside.<br>  <br>  After you get this under control (3 months to ensure cycle is broken and no fleas breeding in your home you have some options:<br>  <br>  Frontline every 3 months for flea but not tick control (I do this, we live in a flea but not big tick area).  Limit chemical exposure.<br>  <br>  Try feeding brewers yeast to your dog as a supplement to avoid fleas if you don't live in a high flea area.<br>  <br>  you need to use the "big guns" to rid a heavy flea load, after you are cleaned up, try the brewers yeast for a natural approach.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Frontline does not have any harsh chemicals that can harm your dog same with advantage i believe. But if you don't want to use them, you really don't need to go to the vet. All you have to do is look online for brewer's yeast garlic tabs they work.

Put her down and simply ignore her for a few minutes....it's a bit of "Kitty Time Out".<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|m16gf9mzaa	I once read, and sorry but I have no idea where to track this down at again, that cats bite the nose to assert social dominance.  So, yes, you do need to prevent her from biting your face for possibly more reason than preventing injury.  When I've had a cat who did that, I put my mouth around their nose - i.e. made the gesture of biting without actually digging teeth in - while holding them still for a few seconds.  You may not want to do that, either because it's too weird or because I don't have a citation to back myself up with. I bet scruffing the cat - immobilizing the cat by firmly grasping the loose skin on the back of its neck - for a couple of minutes would get the "you're not the boss of me" message across.|`|sHBPfItfaa	just take her off your lap and ignore her as soon as she does it, once she realizes this pisses you off she will stop.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Any time she bites you, (whether she's playing or she's mad) say "OUCH!" really loud, then walk away from her. If you've ever heard a cat howl when you accidentally stepped on its tail, mimicking that noise will work well too. Walking away from her helps her understand that when she hurts you, that makes you not want to pet or play with her any more.<br>  <br>  <br>  Clean the wound thoroughly with antibacterial soap and warm water for several minutes.  Then apply antibiotic ointment, (such as Neosporin, polysporin or bacitracin) and a bandage.  Watch carefully for any signs of increasing redness, swelling or local warmth.  See a physician immediately if these signs of infection occur.  Bite wounds on hands are the most prone to infection.|`|uB4ZQOEDaa	if she does this then runs away then it could be a sign of over stimulation - you need to pet her slowly and rhythmically. if she does this and stays put it could just be a sign of her grooming you.

AA11901352	Dechlor/water conditioner is the only chemical you should add when water changes.  You should not be dosing with calcium daily for your tank.  If you are using dolomite or even sand it isn't needed and you are going to end up with a calcium buildup in the tank.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to grow reef plants etc on your live rock Nanoreef Part A and part b Not always a daily dose.  Unless your tank is in need of calcium don't add it daily.<br>  <br>  Most of the minerals your fish need come from the salts you mix for your water along with the fresh calcium from the water source.  <br>  <br>  Also water changes are not a weekly thing for a salt tank.  Water changes when needed only and in an established properly set up tank can go months (provided you have a skimmer)  Even iodine should not be added unless needed since it is in the salt source. Once per month is a good schedule for salt tanks for 25% water change.  Doing this will replace the minerals, calcium (that is unless you have a number of crabs and no crushed shells already in the tank).<br>  <br>  Unless you are really experiencing problems no other chemicals are really needed. Again calcium isn't needed every day or they should not be needed.|`|nlRr07dRaa	You can get a 2 part Calcium/Alkalinity set of chemicals, they ussually have all the basics you need. for years I had a 65yr old lady maintaining a 29gal tank and that's all she added every couple days. once every two weeks I would change her filters and do a 15% waterchange and her tank was one of my favorites.... kept corals nice and healthy, and had lots' of beutiful coraline on all the rocks!|`|vVAwFgcJaa	You don't have to use Chemicals.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	The cat who was outside now smells different than before.  That's why the other is attacking her.  She actually thinks it's a strange cat. It will take a couple of days for things to get back to normal. Don't bathe the cat as that will just add to the stress that's already going on. As for showing them kittens, you should never put strange cats face to face with each other without first using a slow introduction method where they are allowed to smell but not see the new cat for a few days.  Cats are territorial and will fight/hiss/run when faced with a strange cat.  <br>  <br>  The cat who went out is most likely pregnant now.  You can safely have her spayed up to 3 weeks into the pregnancy.  Please call your vet to have her spayed ASAP before it's too late.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	few days and give her a bath|`|hwtIZH7Yaa	yeah i would say that when your cat went out she was in heat....she is most lilkey prego. i would say give her a nice bath and then try to put them together again. then i would take her to the vet...
QB0CnrmJaa	Try to go into a room with your Budgie (also called parakeets) and let it fly around you. Make sure there are no openings it could get into and no hiding spots. :)<br>  <br>  You could also give them "millet" which you can buy at your local pet store. Place it on your shoulders and put your shoulder on the outside of the opened door of their cage. See if they fly onto your should and eat it and if they do fly on, try petting it to see if it trusts you.<br>  <br>  Your parakeet may trust you and you don't even know it, but it is just afraid when you try to pick it up. Reach your hand in the cage slowly and try picking it up. I'm sure the father bird is just afraid to leave the two younger birds alone, so try to keep them all together when you take one out. Never leave one alone, because then it will definitely not trust you.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your Budgie! Hope this helps a bunch. :)

Y42J2P2Naa	For acute dog diarrhea, you can consider giving your dog home remedies. First off, give them fresh and clean water at all times. Since diarrhea makes them dehydrate rather fast, you should be able to sustain their water supply. You can add probiotic powder to their water to improve their condition. Water therapy is very crucial during the first two days of their diarrhea attack.<br>  <br>  After giving them a water diet, observe your dog's demeanor. If their condition improves, you can start giving them bland foods and low fat foods. You can feed them boiled foods, tofu and fruits like pumpkins. Fruits and vegetables rich in fiber can also help. You can also add probiotic water to their food. Probiotic is a dietary supplement that has useful bacteria and yeast that can aide in the improving your dog's health condition.<br>  <br>  One more thing that you can do is to use remedies that are used to treat human diarrhea. You can use Pepto-Bismol, a medicine that can also be used for treating dog diarrhea. You can give them 1ml of Pepto-Bismol for every 10 lbs. of your dog's weight. Give this medication to your dog three times a day, for no more than one week. You can also use .5 mg of Loperamide Immodium for every 10 lbs. body weight, three times daily.<br>  <br>  You can also purchase medicines that are meant for dogs. You can ask your vet for a prescription. Prices can go anywhere from $5 to $50. A Diarrhea Control Gel can cost you $14 and a 4 oz. bottle of Pet-Pectillin Diarrhea Medication goes for $5. You can also give them capsules like DiaBac that would cost you $23 for 30 capsules and $50 for 60 capsules.<br>  <br>  It is very important to drop by your veterinarian for consultation if your dog does not seem to respond to any of the remedies that you tried. If your dog's condition is critical, a visit to the vet can save your dog's health.|`|UmhWxs1laa	Depends on the dog's age.<br>  <br>  A healthy adult dog can get doggie viruses that aren't serious.

Withhold all food and treats but not water for 24 hours because food feeds the bug. After, introduce him to a bland diet for a couple of days. You can get special stuff from the vets but the old stand-by is plain, boiled chicken and rice because it is bland yet still nutritious. <br>  <br>  If it is the consistency of water, constant, has blood in it and/or your dog is lethargic and not himself, then a trip to the vets is in order.<br>  <br>  This advice is obviously only relevent if you dog has had all his vaccinations and has not eaten anything that could be poisonous or toxic to him. If these are the circumstances, he needs to go to the vet right away.|`|AA11806718	Call the vet.  If you have more than 1 dog with diarrhea, you probably have some infection.  You know like Parvo|`|HrDcaocMaa	Keep them outside!|`|5UZYoIEFaa	Definitely take your dog to the vet. It could be an indicator that something is seriously wrong. However, it may just be an upset stomach or reaction to something he/she ate. You could try boiled chicken with white rice. This works well when my dogs have an upset stomach, but if this continues, definitely see a vet.|`|AdCFLNM6aa	I have a year and half old Pug and he gets diarreah about every other day. He never seemed sick or inhibited by it. It was jus annoying. So I took him to the vet and he recommended FLORTA-FLORI.

He been on it for 3 weeks and he hasn't had diarreah once!!|`|AzJ8t1ZTaa	Acute (short-term) small intestinal diarrhea can be managed by withholding food, but not water, for 24 to 48 hours. If diarrhea stops, small amounts of a bland, low-fat food are fed three to six times daily for a few days, with a gradual increase in the amount fed and a slow transition back to the pet's normal diet. Special diets usually contain rice, which is more digestible than other grains.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-diarrhea-wsu.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/dog-diarrhea-wsu.html</a>|`|lwUHC13vaa	TAKE YOUR DOG TO THE VET!! like right now! <br>  its sad but im going to tell you what happened to my dog)':<br>  my dog he had really bad diarrhea and we didn'tt take him in andd.. ..<br>  one day it got soooooooooooo bad that he.... .... started to poop his guts out! it was sooo sad.. sooo we had to put him down so he wouldn't be in pain anymore because the doctors couldn'tt do anything to fix it)':|`|5a3708261598f993c0978607e5b0ce22aa	Per my vet,  I feed my poms plain white rice and sometimes boiled chicken with it...if it lasts more than a day, then call the vet asap.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	Details are needed.
0NYQNr9saa	I don't recommend putting them together, but if you want to try, make sure they are both neutured (otherwise they'll just fight, especially if they can smell the female nearby) and introduce them on neutral ground (where neither of them has marked as 'their' territory.)  You could put something like a gate that stops kids falling down stairs up between them so they can sniff each other and see how they react, if it all seems to be going okay, you can take the barrier away, but be close by to break them apart if they start fighting.|`|723qR6p8aa	Hiya.x<br>  I would definatly not recommend putting them together. My friend breeds rabbits so i know tons about them. Neutered males will fight aswell its territorial. They would maybe be ok if they where from the same litter but as they are from separate litters the chances are they wont get along. I know male rabbits can be fine with each other for 1-2 years even before they one day start to serously fight. Its not worth the risk of losing one of the male rabbits, so i'd keep them separate to be safe. If they are not neutered they will try to mount each other and this will lead to serious fighting! Also if they smell a female they will again fight serious. If you are adamant to keeping them together then you will need a 2 story hutch up stairs and downstairs making sure they have a bedding area each a bowl each and a water bottle each. They will fight if there is only one of these. They hate sharing a sleeping area water and food so make sure they know they have a bowl and water bottle each. Also make sure you give them both the same like treat wise as this could lead to a fighting match over a treat one has. I would defo not put them in the same hutch as of what they are already in as they will fight for domince as whoevers hutch it is they will not be amuzed at having to share. Dont introduce them by the hutch do it gradually by a week- introducing them through the run, in the house or even by putting one in a puppy play pen in the house the other one out of it and they will sniff and things at each other through the spars. Dont leave them unattended for at least the first week! Keep them separated.<br>  Hope this helped.<br>  Good Luck<br>  Mwah/.x|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	Trying to put them together is very risky if they feel the other is invading their territory they will fight to the death it is probably best to leave them apart.
meMF69tXaa	They were mounting each other, correct? This is normal behavior. It's a way for one rabbit to show dominance over another rabbit. Female rabbits do this also.<br>  <br>  You really need to seperate your male rabbits until you get them neutered. Male rabbits are very territorial and can injure each other seriously. They can also cause death if the fight is severe.|`|723qR6p8aa	Hi.x<br>  Yes they will do that but that is seriously not good! This will lead to huge fights as they will both try to mate each other up they wont give it a rest one will get fed up and then they will end up injuring each other. If your planning on keeping them together you will of course need a double hutch so they have plenty of room. A separate bedding area each they may use the same but they like to know thye have one each as they will end up getting territorial of the same bedding area and hate sharing. They will need a bowl each one up and down down and same with a water bottle as all of this will cause fights. I do not think you should keep them together as they may get on for about 1-2 years then eventually start fighting and you may end up losing one of them. Especially if they are not neutered. Keep a close eye and dont put them in each others hutch they will hate the sharing part and be territorial of the hutch and end up fighting.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|WkhVNEgtaa	yes this is completely normal. the only way to put a stop to it is to have them neutered.<br>  <br>  I personally would have one although prefrebally both neutered as this will stop teritorial disputes/ fights occuring in the future<br>  <br>  You should also explore the avenue that they may have been incorrectly sexed by the pet shop (this is remarkably common) and in fact one may be female?|`|Y42J2P2Naa	Wow that's weird O_o <br>  By the way, they might fight.|`|WttNh1hsaa	i wouldn't put them together as my two males fighted after trying it on with each other it is not nice when they fight they pull each others fur out and all sorts its not the greatest idea|`|uQkLo6ZTaa	r they gay?
LVZdzPmpaa	There is a product called Nature's Miracle that you can buy at the pet store or online. It is an enzyme cleaner that is guaranteed to work. It is also safe for all surfaces.<br>  <br>  It comes in liquid in various size containers, as a powder that you mix with water (I don't recommend it) and in a spray bottle.<br>  <br>  The odor in your kitchen is due to the urine soaking into the wood or into the crevices between the planks. Wiping the surface  isn't going to get rid of it. The areas need to be treated with a penetrating cleaner like Nature's Miracle. That will surely take care of it.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	as the first person said, use vinegar and water|`|LjEv7Bdqaa	Truthfully, I would research it on the internet or ask you local vet.

7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	Not too many  breeders  breed to get the tiny ones. They are just a fact of life. The big registered breeders get them sometimes...their size does NOT mean they are unhealthy.  It means they are just tiny.  In some families you will find  one of the kids  much smaller than the others  and it doesn't mean they are sickly, altho it can sometimes be a cause.....it just means  the genes  in the gene pool  have produced a smaller  child.....or dog.<br>  I have a friend w/a very tiny Chihuahua  who is 14 yrs old...and in perfect health....starting to get cataracts  but that is normal. She has not had one speck of problem w/the health of her pet.  I've known others  also w/the same experience.  Tiny does NOT = sickly.<br>  Actually, in general, the rule is the smaller the dog the longer the lifespan.  Example:  Great Danes...life expectancy 8 yrs<br>  Chihuahua....13-14   Look at Mickey Roarke...his Chihuahua just died  a couple of wks ago...he was 20!!!  And never sickly.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Instead of ecouraging the breeding (and suffering) of more runts by miserable back yard breeders and puppy millers who just want to make a buck by breeding companion animals as if they were livestock, go to a CHIHUAHUA BREED RESCUE.<br>  They likely will have a tiny chihuahua (they are hardly big dogs in any case, they are in the Toy group) that your brother can adopt.<br>  <br>  This not only doesn't enrich a byb or puppy miller, it actually gives a dog a home.   Why would you not consider that?<br>  <br>  Try Petfinder.com and chi breed rescues - do a search.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	The reason the prices are so high is because teacup pieces of crap are in high demand.

If you buy one, then the "breeders" will just keep breeding them and it is not okay for then more dogs will have to live like bogus and then they die earlier.

My rabbits have done this in the past.<br>  <br>  Be aware that if it happens all the time, it could mean they are eating too much calcium. Rabbits can't process calcium well so if they're getting too much, it shows in their urine as a creamy sludge. This happens sometimes when rabbits are fed only pellet food. As long as yours are getting plenty of hay and grass as well, it should be fine.<br>  <br>  As always, if you remain concerned, check with your vet.|`|AA10063059	yes all rabbits do this
stMcVPCMaa	Male horses could probably pull the carriage together but they can be pretty temperamental, so it might be a little more realistic if the horses were geldings (male horses that have been neutered-they could work together with no problem).  But it's conceivable that two stallions could still be used to pull the wagon.<br>  <br>  For the answer to your question, I'm going to say an hour and 20 minutes:<br>  <br>  2.25 (hours) * 3.5 mph (person's walking speed) / 6 mph (speed of horse and wagon)  = 1.33 (time for horse and wagon).<br>  <br>  The distance in this equation is 7.88 miles.<br>  <br>  This is assuming the average walking speed of a person to be 3.5 mph (as per the first site below, also saw this figure in several other sites so seems to be as good an average as any.)<br>  <br>  I found it tough to find a definitive answer as to how fast a wagon in your scenario could travel, but based on what I read in the websites below I'm going to choose an average speed of about 6 mph.  The horses could of course also go faster (probably up to 10 mph pretty realistically) or slower, so you could even vary the answer to suit a specific scenario, for example horses traveling at a higher than average rate of speed to cover the same ground a person walking slowly would travel, so you could probably safely choose any answer in the range below:<br>  <br>  Slow walking speed, fast horses:<br>  2.25 (hours) * 2 mph (person walking slowly) / 10 mph (fast speed of horse and wagon) = 28 minutes (total time for horse and wagon)<br>  <br>  Average walking speed and horses:<br>  2.25 (hours) * 3.5 mph (person's walking speed) / 6 mph (speed of horse and wagon)  = 1 hour 20 min (total time for horse and wagon).<br>  <br>  Fast walking speed, slow horses:<br>  2.25 (hours) * 5 mph (person walking quickly) / 4 mph (slow speed of horse and wagon) = 2 hours 45 minutes (total time for horse and wagon).<br>  <br>  Last one is interesting, I guess a horse/wagon could go slower than a person walking fast!  <br>  <br>  I'm guessing a single donkey probably couldn't even pull a wagon with 5 people, but I haven't worked with donkeys much so I'm not sure what they could actually pull.  If they could, it would have to be slower than a person's average walking speed.  <br>  I found the horse speed sites by googling "horse wagon mph"; you could try the same for donkeys if you're still wondering.  My head hurts after just trying to figure out the horses!<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!  Good luck with your story!
D1beU6MPaa	I have two Shih Tzu's with the same thing. Most likely it is his belly button. Some have belly button that are innies, and some have outties. It could be a mild hernia, but I really do think it is his belly button. You vet can confirm though. Good luck|`|nlMfJtxcaa	At 13 weeks he should have already had his first round of shots. If not he is at great risk of contracting Parvovirus, especially if you've taken him outside. Go to the vet now for the shots. The lump might be a hernia, which would have to be removed.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	It's probably an umbilical hernia.  One of my Cavaliers had one and I had it repaired when he was neutered.<br>  <br>  Your dog should have had two vaccinations by the time he is 13 weeks old.  You're taking a big risk by not vaccinating him.  I would take him to the vet ASAP for his shots.  There is a high risk of an unvaccinated dog getting parvo.<br>  <br>  The hernia can wait until you have him neutered.  Hernias are repaired, not removed. It's very simple surgery that requires only 1 stitch.  These umbilical hernias are usually because the mother dog was a bit enthusiastic when biting through the umbilical cord.  They pull the umbilical cord just a bit too hard. <br>  Add. An umbical hernia IS the belly button/umbilicus.  Dogs don't have innies and outies like humans.|`|VQlkO7lqaa	YOu are taking a great risk at not having your dog vacinated.

Y5FyAekkaa	I am an advocate for training cats and i think your making an honest effort to avoid declawing so that is commendable. Odds are your cats will learn that the electric shock is associated with the entire couch. You can also try two remedies that worked for me. One is that when your home and they are on the couch to either spritz them with a water gun or toss a can of coins in their direction to deter them. For when your not home i would buy a computer desk mat (the plastic ones with the spikey bottom), cut to fit the areas of your couch and place it spike side up when your not home. These both have been effective for me. Its also much much cheaper. Good luck.|`|Klb8kTtDaa	I have a friend that uses a scatmat and he says it works, but it is used on a floor and not couch. I stepped on it and it gives off quite a shock. It seems a little cruel to me. <br>  I bought a clear plastic carpet runner and turned it upside down on my couch and chairs. The nubs on the bottom of it don't injure the kitty but annoy it enough to stay off the couch. I was able to cut off pieces too for the arms and tops of the couch. Its cheap and you can buy it by the foot too. <br>  Another thing I tried was something called "Cat Away" - a spray. It actually worked! I was really amazed. <br>  I've tried tin foil and  sticky side up tape as well, but those didn't work for me and were really time-consuming to take off the couch when I was having company over (not to mention that they are one-time use only  so that can be expensive). <br>  I can understand wanting to spray them, but do you really want to get your couch wet, and have to stand guard all the time watching for the cat to be bad?|`|1OcnwywZaa	It could be an effective way to get the cats off the furniture, but there are other ways that wouldn't shock or hurt the cats at all.  There are cat repellent sprays that are non toxic to the cat.  You spray the stuff on the couch where the cat may want to go, and you can keep spraying the areas for 5 days... this usually clears it up.<br>  <br>  I personally would not use a scatmat just in case kitty is somehow wet, or something spills on the scatmat.  Also to answer your question, cats are extremely intelligent, and they will learn that parts of the couch won't shock them at all!!<br>  <br>  There is another idea i have used, it's double sided sticky tape called sticky paws and keeps the cats from scratching at it - because they don't like their paws to be sticky...<br>  <br>  Personally i'd go with the other two ideas and only get the scat mat if everything else fails... another idea is to put a bit of cat nip in areas they are allowed to go on...  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!
HvbIE03saa	Most all cats do this to cover their pee or poop. If they're kicking it a lot and it's spilling out of the litter box, you can try getting a good sized plastic tub (the kind for storage) and using that as a litter box.<br>  <br>  One of my cats likes to kick the litter around a lot, so I got one of those because of the high sides and it works like a charm.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	I had a problem with one cat that did that.

She always says her cat clentches its paws to hold as much litter as possible, then when she gets out of the box, she lets go of the litter. <br>  I wouldn't suggest a litter box with a top because it holds the odor in, and unless you clean (really clean!!) the box daily, the cat will be bothered by the smell and may not go in there. <br>  My suggestion is getting a deeper litter box, and if that doesn't work, put the litter box inside a cardboard box - just make sure the box is big enough so that the cat can jump in and hit the bottom of the cardboard box first before climbing into the litter box. It will contain the litter very well.|`|lFdWmDjGaa	She is burying her business.

This is incredibly difficult especially if the cat has any degree of dehydration. If you vet attempted to draw from a hind leg vein or a front leg then i would try someone else because it would be no wonder she couldn't get enough. However if she attempted the jugular (in the neck) than she showed great skill in knowing when to quit. The more stress a cat gets the worse any medical condition can become. At his age and with that weight loss he defiantly needs the lab work. I hope this helps you make a decision.|`|Klb8kTtDaa	My poor little kitty had the same problem with weight loss and the vet said she couldn't get blood because the kitty was so dehydrated that the veins were small. <br>  You can't force a kitty to drink, so maybe the vet would have a better suggestion.

If they can't do it then try a different vet who has more experience with cats.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	I'd be in search of another vet.  Usually if they can't get blood that means a cat's dehydrated (as the other posters have said).  And if that's the case, the dehydration should have been addressed, and not by telling you to come back another day.   It's either that or the vet techs don't have the skill or patience.  Either cause, it says to me that this isn't a vet I'd want to take my cat to ...

oDVx7nSxaa	Often when cats have a sensitive stomach, it really means they are sensitive to the grains (especially corn) in their food.  TOTW is really a cut above what you're currently feeding, and grain free.  I'd be inclined to get a small bag, and mix it in with what you're currently feeding, and see what happens.  And there is no reason why you can't mix more than one brand of dry, either.  I feed mostly canned (at the advice of my vet, BTW, who's now opposed to feeding cats dry food and has always been opposed to cheap food), so I have never used the TOTW, but i do use EVO, also grain free.  My dry food junkie is a sensitive stomach cat but he does just fine on the EVO.|`|eDySIDPQaa	I feed Taste of the Wild for all my dogs and they love it.<br>  <br>  go to their website and read the ingredients, for cats.....<br>  <br>  It does have different formulas<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.Tasteofthewilddogfood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Tasteofthewilddogfood.com</a>|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I feed TOTW to my dog and I did feed it to my cats before one of them went into renal failure and I put them all on wet.  None of mine have ever had problems with sensitive stomachs so I don't really have personal experience with it but there are no by-products, grain, or soy in it and that helps with sensitive stomachs.  The proteins in TOTW are novel so you might need to do a gradual switch so they can adjust. All in all, I am very satisfied feeding it to my dog. If they made a wet formula, I would still be feeding it to my cats.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	My guy with a sensitive stomach was helped a lot by the Royal Canin Siamese 38 which is made for cats who eat and barf.

GSf09ALBaa	She was spayed less than 48 hours ago.  Some dogs do very well with spaying (my Pit has no idea it even happened) and some dogs have discomfort.  She is being needy right now and wants to be with you.  <br>  <br>  When she is feeling like she can jump on the sofa or bed, she will.  For her NOT to even try to do right now is GOOD.<br>  <br>  So I would just go with it.  In about 3 to 5 more days she should be back to normal.|`|bIaywrBCaa	you should make sure she doesn't try to jump or she may cause her stitches to come out. The vet should have advised you of this. Yes, pick her up and put her on things instead of letting her jump. You will need to do this for about a week-10 days. You should still restrict her activity. I never heard of a vet who said jumping was okay after spay surgery. I have had many dogs spayed.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Maybe help heron furniture for another day but don't let it be a habit. Also be very careful that she does not jump down. <br>  There is no reason why she should not be able to walk to the garden or eat by herself.<br>  <br>  Internal stiches can still seperate. If the vet has approved the activities why are you asking?|`|5rfnEQnGaa	SOunds like she has you well trained :-)<br>  <br>  Try putting a bed for her on the floor so she does not have to jump up and down off the sofa, crate her if necessary when you are not able to watch her, but she can now walk by herself to go ooutside. I think she is just attention seeking.<br>  <br>  If you are not sure, just give the vet a tel call to check nothing is wrong.|`|GEeaONhGaa	You shouldn't be letting her jump up at all I'm surpeised the Vet didn't tell you this, you don't want to be lifting her either, let her stay on the floor until she is healed.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I would do it while she has her sutures.  She's probably not in a lot of pain but jumping up and down may be uncomfortable for her and may damage her sutures. I wouldn't keep hand feeding her though.  Lift her down and feed her in her normal spot.  Her appetite may be a bit off, but that's normal for now.  She'll be eating fine in a day or two.|`|B94Poxv4aa	I don't think she should be jumping just yet, and when she tries it hurts.<br>  Keep watching her for further pain, as there maybe complications, from the surgery. Rush to the vet if the pain persists, which will show itself in other ways too, not just jumping on the couch. <br>  Don't feel too sorry for it thought as the puppy will take adventage of that quickly and eventually it will run your life. I would not be lifting her, and I would not have her on the couch eather. Ever.|`|A9MDoFooaa	take her back to the vet straight away - remember animals do not have human personalities, although we laugh and say they do to an extent - if she is in pain her natural pain killers will also be making her feel a bit dopey and in less pain, obviously - don't presume she is being a "madam" and if it turns out she has simply learned this behaviour then you will have to teach her a different one, once you are certain she is not in pain.|`|2RHGigcyaa	Try putting a bed for her on the floor so she does not have to jump up and down off the sofa, crate her if necessary when you are not able to watch her, but she can now walk by herself to go ooutside.

QB0CnrmJaa	Most likely when you trim its talons it will bleed. So I suggest you take your parakeets to the vet to treat its talons.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of anyone clipping parakeet's talon's, but I have heard for chickens and everything. I suggest you don't trim their nails, and buy toys their talons don't get stuck on.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck with your parakeets!|`|59zYV36Eaa	I don't know if you're going to make them not like you more, but you sound like you know how to go about the clipping.  You could bring them to a pet store or vet's office too if you needed to.|`|VdeV0jUqaa	If your scared of losing your birds trust when clipping its nails its a good idea to take it to the vet so the vet can do it- that way he can hand the bird back to you and you can 'save' it from the horrible person who was attacking its feet! Its worked for me while I was still working on gaining trust with my Quaker.<br>  If you do try to do it yourself its a good idea to have the right equipment- budgies nails are pretty thin so you can probably trim them with nail clippers but I wouldnt recommend them with most parrots.<br>  You will need someone to help you hold the bird- if you hold it firmly on both cheeks it wont be able to move its head to bite you. Then someone else can clip of the end of the nail- you only need to clip a tiny bit from the end- cut it too far and it will bleed. alot.<br>  Its good to go to the vets for the first time, just to see how its done. Good luck.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi Peaches,<br>  <br>  If it were my cat I would not be pleased with a facility that allows strange cats to be together for even a moment. I would be looking for a facilility that cares for my cat in a "room" or very large cage, all to himself. Some boarding facilities have  very large cages that actually are walk-ins. <br>  <br>  You can see a photo of what I am describing, here:<br>  <a href="http://www.bayshoredogandcatcare.com/dogandcatboarding/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bayshoredogandcatcare.com/dog...</a><br>  <br>  Since I have two cats, of course I would want them to be housed together to keep each other company, which is important.<br>  <br>  But if at all possible, I would prefer to have a pet sitter come to my home, so that my cats would be in their familiar surroundings. Very often veterinary technicians provide "sitting" services, or clinics can recommend licensed and bonded people who provide these services. Very often the cost of maintaining a pet at home is about the same cost as boarding them.<br>  <br>  I have had a lot of success with pet sitters who are trained to take care of any medical needs that my cats have, such as administering medications. Either vet techs who are working, or former vet techs make excellent sitters.<br>  <br>  But do not allow your cat to be given access to strange cats. You are right in your concern about fighting, and/or any illness or parasites that a strange cat may be harboring (without the knowledge of the staff or the owner), even though vaccine records are required. <br>  <br>  So either go with those catteries that keep cats separate or hire a licensed, bonded pet sitter to take care of your kitty.<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful vacation... knowing that your kitty is safe and sound.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association|`|NjOmMVZ7aa	Check out your local catteries at the Feline Advisory Bureau website -- www.fabcats.org. They can recommend the best catteries in your area (and it's worth travelling to find one! -- and you can talk to the owners about your cat's requirements. I would not advise allowing your cat to mix with others -- too many chances of injury or infection. Most cats are solitary creatures, so do not need same-species interaction.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	Cats are not pack animals. There is no responsible reason for them to be permitted to interact with each other. Even if the cattery owner requires proof of vaccines (you did ask that right?) the other cats can still carry a variety of parasitic infections that can spread to your cat. Odds are that all the cats are going to be stressed out enough in a strange enviornment. Pick the one that gives each cat its own quiet space.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	I always pay someone to come into my home and take care of my pets. My kitties never did get their marbles back after the time I took them to a kennel. With all the dogs barking they were scared the rest of their lives. I'm sure a cattery is much better. But why not get a PET SITTER! I had hoped to go into the business but with our economy being bad I changed my mind for a few years.<br>  <br>  Anyway I read the book by the lady who started Pet Sitters International. Her web site is below. See if you can find someone in your area! Chances are you can and it would be much better for your kitties too!<br>  <a href="http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Animals.html" rel="nofollow">http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Anima...</a>|`|STUsNoNTaa	If you love your cats the catteries are not the best place for them whilst you`re on holiday see if you have a cat charity in your area for a donation one of their foster carers or even their volanteers  may come to your house if local and feed your cats for you and let them out and in as this is a less stressful option fo the cats. I did this for someone in my area and he left a phone number for problems and opened an account with a local vets in case something did happen to one of his three cats, but luckily nothing did as you have time before august you could talk to either one of them or if you get on with your neighbours you could ask them and if they have cats you could cover for them if they go on holiday better all round for the cats|`|Klb8kTtDaa	I've never left cats with catteries, but my feeling is that I would want my cat isolated all the time and not have 'playtime' with other stranger cats. <br>  Cats not social beings like dogs are, and they prefer to be alone and not with strange cats.  I've had my cat get into seeminly harmless "arguments" with other cats and then I see a small hole on her face that ends up costing $150 to treat. <br>  Of course, our humane society keeps some groups of cats together and I've not seen them fighting, but maybe they just choose cats that have a better disposition than others. <br>  The question is: do you trust the cattery to put only good-natured cats together, or do you think they would just let all the cats run free regardless of temperment?|`|cY8DgJv5aa	As long as all the cats are spayed/neutered and up to date on their vaccines, there is no major problems with allowing them to be together.  Usually, they only let a few cats loose at a time.  Theoretically speaking, there wouldn't be 30 cats all in one room.  There should only be a few at a time.  The cats who enjoy one another will find something to do and the ones who are more solitary will perch themselves up out of the way somewhere.  Sure, there may be a scuffle or two, but I'm sure the facility pays close attention to the cats and would break up any fights.  Personally, I don't like the thought of my cat being cooped up in one small cage for a whole week.  My cat is very active and I would prefer that they be allowed to run around and jump and play if they want.  They can't do that in a cage.  Its really up to you though.  If you don't feel comfortable allowing them to be loose with other cats, then don't.|`|3arJsZ91aa	I'm lucky that the cattery I use is part of one branch of my vets.  They have fairly small pens with an indoor space and an outdoor space.  The only time cats interact is if they are from the same home and then they are allowed to stay in the same pen.  Other than that, they are all kept separate.  They told me that if my cat was scared by her neighbours (glass between pens so they can see each other), they would put up a sheet so that she couldn't see them.  I am lucky in that the people who look after my cat are very caring.  I would not want my cat to mix with others as she doesn't seem to like others coming into my garden, plus I would be worried about fights.  Did you ask whether the people looking after the cats actually interact with them?  At mine, they spend a little time every day with their charges.  I much prefer sending mine to a cattery rather than leaving her at home with a neighbour looking after her as I know she is safe and well looked after and gets cuddles every day, whereas she hides from my neighbour and he never sees her.  Ask questions at the catteries you are considering.  Hopefully one will stand out as the one suitable for your cat.|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	there is never a pro to it. Cat fights, not to mention if a cat is carrying feline leukemia it is highly contagious and deadly. I never et my cats around cats I don't know.

GSf09ALBaa	Peeing on carpet:  Possible urinary tract infection.  Urine sample to the vet.  Rule that out.  Clean the spots she has peeing in with a good pet spot and odor remover you can  get at any pet store.  If she is urinating in the same spots, try and block those off if you can.  <br>  <br>  You are not saying how old the dog is but my dogs need to pee more than 4 times a day.

If she is a puppy their attention span is very short.<br>  7 seconds is good for a puppy who is only a couple of months.  If she is older, she should be able to sit longer.<br>  <br>  Once you get her it the sit position, you give praise and a treat.  Then you tell her stay.  Use the hand signal also.  You have to get eye contact whenever you give a command.  Very important.  If she moves from the stay before you release her (find a command you and everyone will use for the release, such as 'okay', you're free etc) grab her collar, take her back to the same place and give her the sit stay again.   Count off 10 seconds, release and reward.  Then as time goes on make it a little longer.  You can get up to 3 or 4 minutes.  Remember to treat reward and high praise.|`|2RHGigcyaa	Peeing on carpet: Possible urinary tract infection. Urine sample to the vet. Rule that out.

Or she may feel ignored or neglected. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :)|`|JsBb732Maa	When you are working on the sit/stay don't leave your dogs side.Stand right next to your dog and say stay and use the hand signal and straiten back up, have a leash o your dog and if it goes to move give a correction with the leash and put back n the sit and repeat stay.Hold this for a short time and say OK in a happy voice to let her know it's ok to move. she'd released from the stay. Do that until you get a few minutes then as you do the stay take a step directly in front of her and stand for a minute or so, then step back to her side and if she keeps the stay release and praise.Face her in the step in front.Repeat that until you get a good stay and be able to slowly move further away until she can keep the stay. I don't know her age so don't rush it, slow ,small steps. Good luck :-)

Both are very low in nutrient value. At the age of one, she needs a high-protein, high-calcium diet. Good foods are earthworms, fishes, and strips of liver dusted in bone meal. Once she becomes sexually mature, you can start adding dark green leafy vegetables to her diet and gradually increase the percentage to 50% of her food.

This is completely natural. If someone places their hand on your chest and applies pressure to you, you push against it to maintain balance.<br>  <br>  The proper correction for leash pulling is a 'snap' of the leash. The dog will learn quickly if you do this. When the dog creates the initial pressure, do not keep pulling against him - snap the leash backwards away from him. You do not need to be dreadfully forceful here, just enough to 'get his attention' and end the tension he is pulling against. Adding the word 'no' while you do this will reinforce the action and help with future training situations. Expect to have to do this between 12-20 times, depending on how accustomed to pulling your dog has become.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Keep the leash right behind the ears, say your heal command and start walking with her on your side, as soon as she starts to bread make your correction and start again
S3cD0uxXaa	I love Cockers and find them to be happy go lucky, their temperament calls for them to be merry. However do to genetic problems a few Cockers have what is called "Rage Syndrome", which is more common with the English Cocker Spaniel then the American. But many don't have this. If you don't want to risk this, you can rescue a Cocker. There are plenty of purebred Cocker Spaniel rescues in which you can find the perfect dog. The people can help you find the perfect Cocker. They know all about their personalities, energy level, behavior w/ children and animals. You'll be saving a life and getting a Cocker that will best fit your lifestyle. Many people surrender their dogs, so don't think just because they are for adoption that they are for a reason. I think the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a dog to consider. I wouldn't recommend a Dachshund with young children, they are hunting dogs and people often forget this. A Shiba-Inu is a very independent dog, more like a cat, they aren't a breed who's going to roll around in the grass with your kids. The Beagle is a great great dog, but they are high energy, often people talk about excessive barking with them but that's because they are not receiving enough exercise. Research all breeds before you pick one!!! You need to find one that will fit your energy level, while high energy sounds great for kids, it's not usually. They require lots of walks, not just running in the backyard with the kids. Often playing with kids makes dogs more excited and energetic. Mastiffs can handle rough and tough play from children, and while huge they are lazy gentle giants. They are guardians. I would recommend a Mastiff before a Dachshund. Take this dog quiz which can give you an idea of what breeds you should be looking at. And remember there are lots of purebred rescues out there, and if you do buy, buy from a REAL, reputable breeder!

Do you have experience with dogs? What other pets do you have?<br>  <br>  It may be helpful to note that Staffordshire Bull Terriers are one of only two dogs (can't remember the other one) that that KC describes as particularly good with children - they are known as "Nanny dogs" for a reason.

If so, I highly recommend the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel rather than the Cocker Spaniel.  Their temperament is generally much more 'forgiving' when it comes to rough housing with young children.

From my experience, they are also easier to train.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	I don't own one, but, I have groomed a LOT of them over the years. <br>  Probably going to get flamed for this, but, the breed is a mess!

They have the highest # of bite incedents in the US, mostly children. Cocker breeders really need to clean up their act!<br>  I would recommend an English Cocker or a welsh springer spaniel if you really want a spaniel.<br>  I would also recommend you get your dog from a REPUTABLE breeder that does health testing and breeds for good temperaments.<br>  <a href="http://www.ecsca.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecsca.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wssca.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wssca.com/</a>|`|VQlkO7lqaa	I've owned Dalmations, Cocker Spaniels and Boxers.  I do not like the Cocker for a number of reasons.  They are not great with children and can nip sometimes.  They have a tendance to pee when they get excited.  Depending on the age of your children would determine the breed I'd get them.  Good idea to do it in the summer though!|`|h1e6TvFpaa	i dont have one,, but german shepherds are way better. easier to train and loyal and will protect you. once a stray dog bit me and my shepherd attackeed the stray and then got help for me. true story. cockers have to be groomed and they bite and are not good with children, believe me|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Definitely, I would also recommend cocker spaniel.

mRevWUxlaa	Okay... I worked at a Non-Profit Spay/Neuter Clinic in Florida before I moved to Vegas about 6 months ago. I have the PERFECT Flea Control for EVERYONE!!!!! Its a chewable tablet that you buy at the vet or places that I worked that carries Prescription flea meds. Its called Comfortis. They have a website that explains everything about the product.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.comfortis4dogs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.comfortis4dogs.com/</a><br>  <br>  Its ALL NATURAL No pesticides, lasts the full 30 days and is so harmless to the dogs system that a woman who didnt understand the product and thought it was CAPSTAR, gave one to her dog every 3 days, and it didnt harm the dog at all. I went to a confrence meeting with my co-workers and we were told about this product. I use it on my dogs and they havent had a flea ever since. Plus, if you have a dog with itchy skin and some medical skin conditions, this product really helps, sometimes will cure it completely up. I hope you look into it. Trust me, you will be so overwhelmed of what it can do.<br>  <br>  P.S. Can I just mention, Hartz flea products have KILLED many cats and dogs!!!! DO NOT USE THEIR PRODUCTS!!!!! If you dont believe me, got to this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.judyshealthcafe.com/articles/hartzmountain.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.judyshealthcafe.com/articles/...</a>|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Maybe it wouldn't happen if you'd buy some flea control.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	To get rid of fleas, you have to treat three areas: the pet, the inside of your home and the yard.<br>  <br>  To treat the pet, the best way is with a quality topical like Advantage or Frontline. Garlic repels, it does not kill. Anti flea shampoo repels, it does not kill. The topicals are expensive but they are the most effective.<br>  <br>  The inside of your house has to be sprayed with a pesticide flea spray, or flea bombed. All soft bedding should be bleached or washed in hot water. Vacuum thorougly and throw the bag away.<br>  <br>  The yard needs to be treated with a pesticide yard spray. Make sure you get the grass very well because fleas love to breed in damp grass.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Keep your dog on Frontline Plus or Advantage. You have to do it every 30 days but it works.  Your Dad's dogs should be on it too.  Skip the cheaper pet store products - they don't work and they can cause toxic reactions. You get what you pay for.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Why not just invest in a flea/tick/mosquito repellent?  There are monthly applications that you just simply dispense the medication onto their backs.  I like Advantage, but your vet can advise you on what would work best for your dogs.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	i use frontline on my dogs, its really good, but why doesnt your dad sort his dogs out.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	The vet has products that will kill the fleas.  Frontline doesn't work that well according to many people.  Advantage and Advocate as well as Revolution seems to work but it depends on which is best for your dog.<br>  <br>  You can use Capstar tablets to kill the fleas on the dog but they will still be in the environment so you need to attend to that as well.  <br>  <br>  If you get rid of the fleas in the environment by spraying and vacuuming you can put your pup on Sentinel Spectrum. This product prevents fleas from breeding and it is also an all wormer, including tapeworm which the dog will have if it has fleas.  Tapeworm comes from a dog ingesting fleas while biting them.<br>  <br>  Sentinel also is a heartworm preventative but the dog, if over 6 months old, needs to have a heartworm test before giving Sentinal. The test is a simple blood test and the vet can give you the results immediately. Your 3 month old dog doesn't need the test and can go straight onto Sentinel Spectrum.<br>  It's a once a month tablet.  I've had my dogs on it for years and they have never had worms or fleas.<br>  <br>  Add: Don't bother with flea collars, they don't work and many dogs are allergic to them.|`|LywVUxsTaa	You should apply a topical flea and tick ointment about 48 hours after a bath.  It should be good for about 4 weeks, then reapply.  It is more costly than shampoo, but worth it.  The best kind is bought through a vet. I use Advantage Multi, which also has a heartworm preventive in it.  <br>  <br>  Too much garlic can be poisonous to dogs, so I wouldn't give it to them.|`|LwEwd7lcaa	I think you can get flea-collars for the dogs.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.onlynaturalpet.eu/index.php?cName=flea-tick&gclid=CJLiw-SUkZkCFVSK3godKnMbaA" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlynaturalpet.eu/index.php?c...</a>|`|OqsLPqKiaa	Give it a bath every week and buy a flea collar.|`|K879Jev5aa	dear ash......first of all..you are not ever going to 'get rid' of fleas..the most you can hope to do is effectively control them, and this can be done.  fleas are nasty little buggers and quite hardy. the eggs are encased in a hard shell and defy most all flea shampoos.  you may kill the fleas that have hatched but you are not killing the eggs.  Not even close.  The life cycle of a flea is about 14 days....so the adults you kill will not stop the cycle. they will hatch and produce more eggs and in 14 days or so, there are more fleas that will lay more eggs and so on and so on.  You must interrupt this cycle.  I don't know your exercize or potty accomodations but with such a tiny little fellow I assume you take him outside on a lead or if you have a fenced in yard you put him outside to 'go'.  This is good but much harder to control the flea problem.  If it is at all possible, construct a small fenced in area for his outside activities...much easier to take care of.  Treat the area with a good flea and tick killer..douse it down real thorougly and allow it to dry for a day or so.  Never put him/her on a wet treated surface!  Step 2..treat your dog.  Flea and tick killers are o.k., but believe it or not, a dish detergent will work as well.  But i would use a tearless baby shampoo.  Fleas can't swim and a good soaking bath will drown them.  Continued use of a flea killer shampoo can be toxic to your puppy.  They contain chemicals and prolonged use is not good.  After the bath, put the puppy in the dry, treated area.  Now you must treat your house. There are many flea bombs that are sold but I find these tedious and messy...altho quite effective.  If this is your choice then use them according to instructions..do not fudge. after bombing, vaccuum thoroughly!  Under sofa cushions, shake out small mats, wash the dogs bedding.  It's not an easy task, but it's the only way.  I do not recommend flea collars.  Some dogs are allergic to them and their effectiveness is doubtful.  Purchase a flea killer/repellant from your vet..not the local grocery store. Apply it once a month and use it year round.  Cold weather DOES NOT  kill fleas! They merely become dormant till warmer weather.  Fleas/eggs can live for years in a dormant stage.  You may need to repeat this process in a couple of weeks to be sure you have killed off the newly hatched eggs before they mature and lay eggs of their own.  C heck your pup daily for any new fleas.  I use Adams Plus for this process.  If you happen to see any just take a cotton ball saturated with a little a<br>  Adams and apply to the flea.  It's great stuff and has a residual action (it continues to kill) for several days.  Be vigilant!  Fleas, especially on such a little pup, can be devastating.  When a flea bites he is actually sucking blood from your pup, and left to continue can sap your puppy strength, stamina and in severe cases, kill him.  I wish I could give you an easier solution but I can't.  Fleas are also the carrier of tapeworm so check your puppy's stool or have the vet check him.  And one more thing...when you visit with your dad, leave the pup home until your dad gets his flea problem under control. Don't expose that baby to any more fleas than you need to.  I live in the deep south where fleas are pretty much a year round problem, and following my own advice i have been flea free for several years and I own a very hairy breed...afghan hounds.  Their outside exercize area is astro-turfed and is easy to keep clean and difficult for fleas to burrow down and breed......but that is your decision.  Good luck....hope this helps you.|`|VQlkO7lqaa	YOu have to get the area and the other dogs under control.  That means spraying inside and outside with a flea controller.  It also means that each dog must have some sort of flea protection on it.  I do not recommend bathign as it only lasts a short while.  This must be done consistantly for weeks.  You can kill the fleas but the eggs they laid will be back shortly.  It is a hard and time consumming issue once you have fleas.|`|t1ZNsYz5aa	The fleas possible live in the area where the big dog spend most off his time. <br>  Hire a company to spray all your house and will be the best solution to your problem.<br>  <br>  And keep your little dog bathing with flea shampoo.<br>  <br>  My small dog one time got them from out side when he doesn't even have friends. The problem was that cats from the street at night will sleep in front porch and my dog sometime will lays in there. So after hire Terminix the problem went away.|`|zxdEYy3Iaa	Hartz Ultraguard Flea & Tick drops.  <br>  <br>  This stuff works wonders.  Apply monthly and rest at ease.  I have 4 dogs (a chow mix, pit mix, and 2 purebreed Dobermans, no, not the minis) and I live in AR where, if you're not careful and don't take the proper precautions, fleas will run rampant!  I started using this stuff when we first found Bruno (our chow mix)  he was covered in fleas!  We brought him in, scrubbed him down with Sergeant's Flea & Tick Shampoo (the green kind) and put the Hartz on him.  Nearing 2 years later, still haven't found a single flea on him (or any of our other dogs) since!<br>  <br>  P.S. - A couple of tricks me and my husband find useful for bath time:<br>  <br>  Bring treats.  Keep them behind you/on the counter for easy access so you can keep scrubbing and giving them treats for being such good dogs!<br>  <br>  Hop In.  I know this may seem a bit odd and I wouldn't recommend this if your are dipping them but what my husband does is hop in the shower (in boxers) with the dogs.  This really helps to calm them!  I guess they feel better out of not feeling all alone under the pressures of bath time.  Daddy is right there with them. <br>  <br>  We usually share the duties and streamline the process of bathing all 4 of our dogs.  He scrubs them down, I administer treats, dry them off, clip their claws, clean their ears, and rotate them in and out of the bathroom.  My dogs have gotten so used to the routine that all I have to do is let one out and say "next" and the next one comes on in.  (Yes, I'm being serious).<br>  <br>  Just make bath time more fun for them and you should have no problem with bath time.  Another important factor here is making sure that the water is warm, not hot, not cold as such discomfort will inevitably make them want to make a run for it any chance they get.  If they still try to hop out of the tub, hold them with you hand placed firmly on the shoulder facing toward you, towards the front so you are making contact just where the shoulder meets the neck & chest.  This will impair his ability to leap out.  If you are in the shower with them and they are still trying to make a run for it you can either rap your forearm and hand around the lower part of the neck, just at of the shoulder, to the outside of the tub OR you can leave their collars on for you to hold them while you bathe them.<br>  <br>  P.P.S - As for the garlic, yes it helps.  You can give them fresh garlic in their food if you would like.  You may also try Brewer's Yeast with Garlic.  It is really cheap and you can get it from Wal-Mart.  This stuff is great for their skin and coat and does have some flea repelling benefits (although you should still get the Hartz drops mentioned above).  For large dog owner's, this stuff has another added benefit...Large dogs have been found to live shorter lives than small ones due to heart problems.  We all know that garlic is great for the heart.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long but really hope it helps!
i5MxtGENaa	dont worry it wont get burnt, but you want to place it at ne end of the tank with a hide over it and the water bowl on the oppposite side of the tank|`|sSJ8zfebaa	put it under the tank-they move on and off the heater as needed,have 16 snakes including 4 corns|`|AUdKxUzFaa	You're fine, my corns never burrow and I use UTHs.

JDsgCDGUaa	Most likely to be algae<br>  Get an algae eater or a plecko<br>  If you are cleaning your tank ready for the fish it will go cloudy before it is ready but most likely to be algae|`|jpTl3o5naa	I assume you are talking about an aquarium. The green is algae and gets worse when exposed to too much sun. They sell algae eaters at the pet store. I suggest you get a couple. If the tank is near a window it needs to be moved. You also must clean a tank now and then. They have scrapers at the pet store for that and when you drain the tank, put the fish in another tank if you have one. Make sure the water is treated in the tank you move them to and boil the rocks or stones, clean the whole tank and all items before placing the fish back in.|`|AA10558731	Look at it this way: if some science geek told you the air you were breathing was fine even though it was cloudy with a green tinge, would you blissfully breathe it in deeply or would you set off in search of cleaner air, in spite of what the geek said?<br>  <br>  Be nice to your fish.

Em2TJrILaa	Guinea pigs are usually pregnant between 50-70 days. If the female guinea pig looks noticeably pregnant than she doesn't have a great amount of time to go. They don't start showing in pregnancy until about five weeks into the pregnancy. So it shouldn't be long. A vet probably wouldn't be able to tell you how for on your guinea pig is as there is no knowing when the babies were conceived and the length of pregnancy differs from each pregnancy. My old guinea pig was pregnant for different amount of times in each of her two pregnancies. A few days before the babies are born the mother will not move around much and she may stay in one place for most of the time. She will also move newspaper (if you have it in her cage) and hay to make a nest for her newborns. She will probably have her babies at night because they like to have them when its quiet around the house so she is not disturbed and the babies will probably be born when you wake up one morning. If its her first pregnancy there shouldnt be any complications in the birth however sometimes complication can arise. I wouldnt reccomend letting your guinea pig having a second lot of babies because there can be complications as her pelvis isnt in the perfect condtion after giving birth.

Especially to bred. Usually you din't have any problems with them breeding, they breed like rabbits! But if there is no filter or, heater, that could be the problem.

Guppies are normally avid breeders and I find that they love to eat live food--not just dry food. Brine shrimp, tubifex worms, daphnia are greedily consumed.<br>  <br>  Also, unfortunately, guppies eat their young. It could be that the tiny young were already devoured. Get a breeding trap from the fish shop.<br>  <br>  Have another (at least 10 gallon) tank ready for the pregnant female. After she "gives birth", the young fry will stay in this tank. Then return the female to the community tank.<br>  <br>  Feed the young fry *baby" brine shrimp and they will certainly thrive, given the correct temp, pH, live plants and light.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	well normally its 3 females for every 1 male. but idk why it could be that she is just taking her time. or the males are to slow.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	you need more females|`|OqsLPqKiaa	well if there's not an equal amount of females and males the one who has more fights the other ones.  That's the only bad thing about guppies it might also be because you don't have a heater and the water is to cold.  And they need the bubble things so they can breath and bread better.

The slight pain that causes may be more of an itch to her, and cause her to bite them.  You can also purchase bitter apple spray to put on them to make them taste bad so that she won't bite them.  They make some stuff like this for humans who bite their nails too; maybe you could try that.
hoOygDw1aa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  There is no way for me to virtually tell you whether or not your rabbit is pregnant. If you cannot palpate, it is all a waiting game! However, I can tell you this-<br>  <br>  All of my does nest at different times. I have one who nests on about the 28th day of pregnancy. I have another who doesn't nest at all until the moment she pops babies into the nest! And my newer doe nested nearly a week before she was due to deliver.<br>  <br>  As you'll find out, rabbit's dont always fit a general idea. Like humans, they are very individual and everything you breed about them is not always mirrored in your particular rabbit.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest waiting it out. If she is pregnant, she'll deliver sometime between Day 28-31, most likely. If she does not deliver by Day 35, it is probably safe to say she is not pregnant and you can breed her again.<br>  <br>  Good luck for a large, healthy litter!|`|uQkLo6ZTaa	she's pregnant|`|XPfzzmQpaa	SHES PREGNANT maybe she is getting ready to have babies early

"Holes" vary, but we have used the (roughly) 1 inch by 3 inch size. You can get different heights. Ideally use wood posts or metal round pipe as they use for chain link (easier to build a gate, or just buy the gate), but you can use metal T posts. <br>  <br>  Have to remember that with a wire fence, neighborhood dogs and people can get "up close and personal" with your dog. You may want to build a solid wood fence along one or 2 sides to prevent this.<br>  <br>  Depending on your dog and your land, you may need to sink wire into the ground, or dig a trough and fill with concrete to prevent your dog digging out.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Rent a post hole digger get the chain link and post from your hardware store.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	T-posts & six foot horse fence.
