81SjHk0Haa	I agree with most of the others here, don't buy unless you've tried the helmet on somewhere, look at the SHARP website and see what is rated highly and look HJC and Caberg.    Also look at Nitro, G-MAC or Takachi. All are made by the same manufacturer and sold under different brands by the importer. Of these I would recommend the Nitro 700, 1600 and 1700 series. comparison of the shells will tell you what they corespond to in the other brands.    Try www.mandp.com and look at the TK-56 which in the Nitro range is the Nitro 1700 and is what Steve Plater wears, so its bound to be good. Or the TK-170 which is the Nitro 1600 shell and is rated 4 stars by SHARP.    Both helmets well under 50 and I recommend the 1600 as I have the G-mac Variant.|`|lgjIwUftaa	look @ HJC brand I just bought one for a snowmobile on line for $89 and motorcycle helmets are $10 cheaper|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	This government site rates helmets, 1 to 5 stars (5 stars being the highest), and gives prices. Do not buy from an internet store until you have tried it on somewhere helmet manufacturers do differ in their sizes, it also gives advice on getting the best (safest) fitting.    http://sharp.direct.gov.uk/search/result...|`|9e1405bf185a865f8b87ab7c9380d12caa	Go for a Caberg. HJC as has been mentioned or KBC. These helmets are reasonably priced. Just make sure they have a TUV sticker on them when purchasing. Some on ebay dont. Buyer beware.|`|BQPM0yROaa	As others have said, HJC. I've had a 2XL CL-SP for 3 years now and it's been great.|`|1cc0530fb7fd6e139f507fa33c7d10f1aa	All helmets sold in UK should carry an EC sticker certifying that they meet safety standards. The current standard is ECER 22-05. No reputable bike shop will sell a helmet which is not road legal without warning you.   Different manufacturers make different sizes and shapes of helmet - e.g. a Roof XL may be an HBC XXL. Go to the bike shops in your area and try on all the helmets until you find one you like (just like buying shoes), make a note of the size and model then check the internet price and go back to the shop and ask if they can match it. Probably not, but they will usually offer a discount. If you buy the helmet from your local bike shop you have somewhere to go if you get problems with it. If you buy online use one of the big well-known companies (Busters, M&S, thefastone etc.) so you have some backup.|`|cDnUkCyhaa	go for a HJC lordship In carbon fibre,  or the glass fibre flip front.

mKVFIklaaa	Think carefully.  The K series is basically a very good engine, but it has two major flaws.  Firstly, it has a very small water content, so any leak quickly becomes a serious problem leading to the all too common head gasket failure or other similar issues.  Secondly, the design of the gaskets in the water passages of the engine's top half are very poor, causing failure leading to water loss as above.    However, you can get modified gasket kits to overcome the second issue, and kits to either increase the expansion tank or to fit coolant level monitoring systems. Modifying your existing engine, costing far less than a replacement one, is a far better prospect. A modified K series will easily do another 100k miles without any problem, and will sell on very easily too.

bLjGM9yNaa	Most likely nothing...  remove the battery and have a friend take              you to an auto parts store for a battery test and possible       replacement.          Once you are up and running. Hook up volt meter to the battery          ( while it's running ) to see if you've got approximately 14 + volts.           Or take it to a reputable shop for a charging system test          Good Luck..|`|kXUwDLgWaa	If your Battery didn't blow up this time your car should be ok|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	Most likely the battery failed because it wasn't holding a charge.

4biGrjPkaa	As above - The car isnt recognising the transponder in the key, probably a fault at the reader. Its a dealer repair unless you know a really good BMW specialist which would be a slightly cheaper.    Sorry to be the bearer of bad news!    hope this helped    EDIT: I wouldn't rule out MickeyT's suggestion, it could be the starter too|`|yipMDefBaa	This is when you need road side assistance. Worth their weight in gold|`|sCqdisvnaa	Other possibilities, in addition to what's already been mentioned:    If you have a manual transmission, the clutch pedal needs to be depressed in order for the car to start.  The switch that depressing the clutch engages could be failing.    If you have an automatic transmission, there's a similar microswitch that recognises when the transmission is in Park or Neutral, and will only let the car start then.  It could also be on the way out.    Based on your description, it sounds like the car won't even crank most of the time, but sometimes it will, and fires right up . I think that rules out the battery and most likely the starter motor, and points to either what I've described, or some sort of problem with the keys being recognised by the car, or the immobilser system.    You'll likely need to go to the dealer, or to a well-equipped independent BMW specialist for diagnosis and repair.|`|0zgolkhOaa	Funny because this is generally what happens to older cars.  Ive had a 1995 M3 do the same exact thing to me.  Batter does not help is since i replaced the old one with a brand new one.  After possible 20 mins. it is possible to start the car again.  If you are living in cold weather this might be a huge factor since mine stopped doing it after the weather started warming up.  Hope this helps :)|`|8TLj14KTaa	you need a new battery, cars in cold weather that have problems starting, its usually the battery|`|h0hbLbWMaa	I would guess that it will be something fairly simple to fix with a BMW dealer. Does it turn over or is there just nothing happening. If there is nothing happening it could be a problem with your security system i,e the immobiliser. This could be something as simple as your key. Try the spare one. Hope this helps.|`|2NLF7KwZaa	sounds like to me an immobiliser problem if the car is still in warrenty it will be free but shouldnt cost much to have sorted out at a dealer such as greens etc,   however  it may cost a lot to fix also it could just be a key fob problem wich if the key is not censored near the ignition the car wont start like the AA vans, this problem should cost between 15 and 50.00 best bets take it to a dealer for a diagnostic check up,             Hope This helps :)|`|g7M1DxFCaa	And yet another possibility is a problem with your starter motor.  It depends what you mean by 'won''t start'.|`|NRjwqmn9aa	ooooohhhhhhh ouch................. for a 2005 car it really shoudl'nt do that I think you need to take to a BMW Garage and have it professionally looked at and yep I think it may be mega  POUNDS  but at least they'll know what's wrong with it
tO7Rpjmqaa	try pulling the fueses out one by one until you find what is draining your battery|`|kXUwDLgWaa	Well you can keep replacing parts until you find the problem or you can have it checked out by a mechanic before you throw all your money away|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	It's a very simple diagnostic procedure to determine if it's the battery, the alternator or a draw on the battery that's causing your problem.  The alternator output can be checked with a simple volt meter with the vehicle running at 1000-1200 rpm's - it should read 13.8-14.2 volts. If it does, the alternator is fine.   A draw can be checked with a simple 12 volt test light. Disconnect the negative terminal and place the test light from the negative battery terminal to the negative battery cable end - with everything off and all of the doors closed, it should not light brightly (a dim light is normal on cars with computers and electronic radios and such because of the keep alive memories). If it lights brightly, simply remove and replace the fuses one at a time until the light goes out or very dim and you have pinpointed the faulty circuit.  As far as the battery, a quick load test almost always determine its condition.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Alternator|`|mhoCg9feaa	is the alternator,

XWttyiWLaa	Any auto-parts store will tell you the right battery to use.   I replaced mine on my 2001 PT CRUISER TOURING, and it is a little time consuming, but anyone can do it if you take your time.  Anticipate at least an hour.  You do not need a manual, it's pretty easy to figure out.  You will need a ratchet extension to get to the lower bolt.    I threw out the fiberglass padding around my battery as it was deteriorated to 1/2 powder anyways.

WYq2Ld4iaa	is your car a 4 or 6 cylinder because the six cylinders were very prone to getting water in the connectors of the O2 sensors the fix is to get a new sensor that has an updated seal and use dielectric grease when assembling but if your short on cash the temporary fix is to get the connector dried out and use dielectric grease and put it back together.  this will work temporarily and the light will go out after a few trips.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Essentially the same as P0136, P0137 refers to the second oxygen sensor on Bank 1. P0137 means the O2 oxygen sensor's voltage remained low for longer than 2 minutes. This, is interpreted by the ECM as a low voltage condition and sets the MIL. Bank 1 Sensor 2 is located to the rear of the catalytic converter and should produce an output signal relative to oxygen storage capacity of the catalytic converter. This rear (sensor 2) sensor is less active than the signal produced by the front sensor. However, if the ECM senses the sensor is inactive, this code will set.

If you've made up your mind on a handful of choices, choose the best 3 (5 the most) and personally see the vehicle in its actual state/condition.

kOCtAVXwaa	Both of the answers are good so far.  If you cant do a compact two seater, than go with the same makes.  VW, Audi, or Porsche are all a good choice.  The TT is a nice car, but if your going with Audi, I would definitely try to get the AWD version of the car.  They make FWD, but I wouldnt go that way.  3.2 is a good engine block design, as well as the smaller 1.8t or 2.0t.  These are proven engines in the racing world.      your on to a good start with the Audi! Good Luck.|`|d0B3geJNaa	my uncle has the older smaller version and it is an awesome car. its fast and fairly fuel efficient. the interior is nice, like all audis. the smaller version had a really small trunk, the new version is bigger.  there is plenty of room for the driver and passinger. there is only 2 seats.|`|XVMxuADtaa	Get one.    I wouldn't want to be the person behind the driver and front seat passenger but Verne Troyer and Wee Man will get on just fine.    The engine is a V6 and not an inline 4 (1.8T etc) and will be thirsty but fun.    AWD is a bit of a con as it only routes power to the rear wheels when needed so even a Quattro is FWD for 90% of the time.    Save up your money and enjoy!|`|8TLj14KTaa	its a two seater, and not that roomy    if you want a car that has the same engine and AWD but with a back seat look at the Audi A4/S4 or the Volkswagen R32/GTI
WO68RZdIaa	It would be best to take it. Most importantly, you will be in a training atmosphere & will learn what you need to be able to pass your tests to get your license. Secondly, you can get your permit at 15 instead of having to wait until you are 15 1/2 and have to successfully pass a knowledge test to qualify to get your permit.    "If you are enrolled in a drivers education class, you can get an instruction permit when you are 15, if you apply for the permit no more than 10 days before the class starts. If you are not enrolled in a drivers education class, you can get a permit when you are 15? or older, if you pass the knowledge test."    It is always better if you take an approved driver's training course before getting your permit or license for the first time.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	No, but if you chose not to take the course, you have to wait even longer before being able to take your G2 test.

zruhNGKbaa	The Starter is a large powerful electric motor which provides the initial turning force necessary to get everything moving to start the engine.    The "Ignition" is the electrical sub system which consists of sensors, wires, the ECM or Engine Control Module (computer) and the coil(s) and / or distributor and spark plugs and plug wires which are all responsible for delivering a spark at the correct moment in the cycle of each cylinder, to ignite the fuel air mixture which then burns providing a push against the crankshaft which becomes the rotating power which moves the car.|`|3OCx9lsOaa	The ignition is the system used to start a car whereas the starter is a component of the ignition system!|`|kXUwDLgWaa	Go to how stuff works.com|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	very|`|CvRscCrjaa	ignition is where you put the key, starter is motor that starts the car.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The starter cranks the engine over - the ignition fires the plugs.

If you have a wheel puller and a lock plate depressor tool you can do this in about 30 min,just pull the steering wheel remove the lock plate then the turn signal assembly then the ignition lock and then you will see the four star head blots ,tighten them up and put things back just in the reverse order of how they came out.

1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	As Scott K says allow the engine to warm.  If it won't stay running for long enough I would suggest you check the spark plug - it sounds as though the spark is to weak to me - when you give it gas it's flooding the engine as the spark is not strong enough to ignite it. Check the plug and work back through the ignition system up to the coils as these will deteriorate over time (though it must be said, in 5 years I would not expect them to perish!). If all is o.k through the ignition system check the fuel system as a blocked filter or jet will cause bad fuel flow; this in turn can cause the engine to die when you give it throttle, starving the engine of petrol while choking it with air.  The easiest way to distinguish between the two is to sniff the electrode (spark plug) if it looks wet and stinks of petrol you know it's an electrical fault - if it's dry and doesn't this indicates fuelling issues.  Best of luck!|`|u0PHhZOSaa	i agree with Scott k. suzuki do that always have and always will( small bore atv's).|`|h0hbLbWMaa	Just leave it on the choke for a bit with out any throttle and one it's warmed up a bit it should be ok.|`|cLGXa8O3aa	its not super hard to clean the carbs.  and possibly change the sparkplugs.|`|BQPM0yROaa	Sound like typical warm up to me.

After we landed, we saw four caribou grazing by the treeline.|`|1f8667fa7bae46c3ffc3ff576f55d53baa	A friend of mine hit a deer on landing while flying a Cessna Caravan.  It did a number on the airplane (and several numbers on the deer).  I have seen pictures of the aftermath.  The formerly white airplane was red and covered with hair and deer burger.    Afterward, a Fish and Game official began writing him a ticket for poaching.  It was a joke of course, but I would have paid a lot of money to see the look on his face when the guy handed him the "ticket"|`|Tiph3lQcaa	When I was in flight training a student with an instructor hit a deer in a T38 at high speed on the runway. I did not see the results, but I was told that the deer was basically cut in half, and the aircraft suffered some damage to the nose gear. I think they were on takeoff roll and aborted immediately. This could have been a disaster; fortunately, whoever was at the controls did not overreact.|`|EDnT0y8caa	Yes. In the southwest U.S., where I'm currently based, coyotes are pretty common. In fact, I had to abort a takeoff the other day in Tucson because of one that suddenly appeared on runway 21. In Alaska, where I spent 6 years as a "bush" pilot, wildlife was always a problem because many places are not surrounded by fences as in most of the rest of the USA. Bear, Moose, Eagles, flocks of Geese (yes, flocks), you name it. One learns to do a low pass, especially in dusky conditions, to be sure the runway environment is clear of animals on or near the runway.  I've got more than one "MOR" or "BOR" noted in my logbook (moose or bear on runway).|`|AA10026511	that makes me think of the joke  Pilot to tower   there is deer on the runway  tower to deer : please clear runway 5   (as fate has the deer does  Tower to plane  deer has departed because careful of deer wake!  |`|AA11432856	Do cows count, when   I used to fly  in Texas  it was not unusual to see cattle on the grass strip at my friends ranch, even though he had it fenced off seems, cows can jump.

I was about halfway down the runway and the tail had just come off the ground when 7 large bucks ran across the runway 150 yards in front of me.  I did not have enough airspeed to get airborne, and I did not have enough runway to stop.  Fortunately, the last deer cleared my path with enough room for reasonable comfort.  I've also had a couple pop out of a wheat or sunflower field right in front of me in the middle of a spray pass.  That sort of gets your attention too.
VyAHw76daa	I'd say never in Lears, as they have electric and back-up electric, not vacuum-driven, instrumentation. What vacuum pump are you referring to? Vacuum is used to control outflow valves, but I don't that's what you're talking about.   I haven't seen any "suction" gauges or any "Hi Vac" "Low Vac" annunciators on any of the Lears I've flown...  (How about you in your 35A experience and your FSX experience?)    Jets generally utilize electric-driven, not vacuum-driven, instruments. Here is some source material on the difference between electric and vacuum:  http://www.birdbird.org/aviation/examogr...|`|1f8667fa7bae46c3ffc3ff576f55d53baa	Uncommon but not unheard of.    Those types of things are generally good for between 800 and 2000 flight hours.  Some fail earlier and some fail later.  There are backup systems in both those aircraft to ensure vacuum pressure can be maintained even if a pump breaks.    To experience a vacuum pump failure would not be particularly unusual, however to have it become some sort of major event would be rare.|`|u0My4f5uaa	Some newer avionics don't even have vacuum pumps.  For example, the G1000 has AHRS (attitude and heading reference systems).  They are able to detect magnetic heading and attitude with no moving parts.    That being said, I've never had a vacuum pump failure.  It's not a huge deal while flying visually, and all instrument pilots are well-rehearsed on no-gyro flying.  Flying an instrument approach using only the compass is quite a workload, though.|`|EDnT0y8caa	Believe it or not, I had a DUAL vacuum failure one night in a Cessna 402. The odds of that happening are about like winning the lottery. Fortunately it was a VFR night so it was no big deal, although the 90-degree roll induced by the autopilot when the AI tumbled was an attention getter! I've flown over 16,000 flights in everything from trainers to large turboprops and that's the only vacuum failure I've ever experienced. Now, electric gyros, that's another thing. I've had quite a few of those go "tango uniform" in my career. Just lost an attitude gyro last week as a matter of fact, on an IFR trip from Houston to Phoenix. .|`|XsZsk55Jaa	They are rare but do happen.  The FAA has issued a number of ADs (Airworthiness Directives) over the years when they received reports of failing pumps.  ADs are similar to automobile recalls and require some action on the part of the owner, either inspection or replacement within some time limit.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I've been hanging around aircraft for over 30 years and I have seen one 'failed vacuum' pump and it only had 10 hours on it. And it was off neither a Beechcraft or a Leer.
UzQyb1hNaa	you either have a bad ground, cheep rca's or you ran your one of your speaker wires/rca's next to your power cable    fix all this and it should have no interference|`|57538f16d30f70e49205cdea88182aa7aa	All strange noises you hear in your speakers are caused by 1 of 2 problems: Ground Loops and EMI (ElectroMagnetic Interference).Commonly referred to as engine noises, these 2 problems are responsible for ALL engine noise problems.Ground Loops: Electronic circuits are simply a power source connected to device or load (electronic equipment). In order for thecircuit to operate, voltage from the power source (in mobile electronics that source is the vehicles battery) is sent through wires to theelectronic device or equipment. The device will still not work unless a return wire is connected from the devices ground connectionto the power sources ground connection or terminal which will complete the circuit path allowing the equipment or device to work.In automotive applications, the vehicles battery has a thick or heavy gauge battery cable connected to the (+) positive terminal orbattery post that supplies the vehicles electrical system with power. What most people do not see is a similar heavy gauge power wireconnected to the batteries (-) negative terminal or battery post. This cable usually connects to the vehicles alternator (-) negativeterminal or contact then it is bolted to the metal frame of the vehicle itself. In doing this, the metal frame of the vehicle is now theelectric ground of the vehicle. A ground is simply another word for the (-) negative return path back to the power supplies(vehicles battery) (-) negative terminal or battery post. Auto makers do this because is effectively reduces the wire run through theelectrical system in half. The auto maker generally only has to run (+) positive voltage wires to components while the (-) negativeground wires can simply be screwed directly to a nearby metal part of the vehicles body frame. This way the (-) negative ground returnto the battery is carried by the vehicles metal frame, to the heavy gauge battery cable bolted to the frame which will return the (-)negative ground back to the battery - completing the circuit necessary to make the equipment run.Ground loops are usually caused when the (-) negative ground returning to the battery has a high resistance, or the wire ormetal frame used to send the (-) negative ground is not the best path and the (-) negative ground has to fight to return back tothe battery.Radio Ground Loops: 2 basic types of radio ground loops exist.Too many components using the same ground wire. This is a common problem when installing a new replacementradio using the auto makers factory power and speaker wire attached to the radio wire harness (The Install DoctorHIGHLY recommends using the auto makers factory power and speaker wires. Most vehicles will never have groundloop problems). Auto makers, in an attempt to simplify wiring around the radio and air conditioner try to reducewiring by using only a few ground wires. Many times the auto maker will merge ground wires from multipleaccessories (radio, air conditioner, hazard switch, and others) into a single ground wire before connecting it to themetal of the vehicles frame. When this happens, a ground loop forms. Ground loops would not normally affect theoperation of these other accessories, but it does affect the radio. Since the radio makes noise, the ground loop will beheard through the radio.Solution: For many vehicles, it is sound installation practice to connect the new replacement radios groundwire directly to the metal of the vehicles frame and avoid using the original radios ground wire in thevehicles radio wire harness.Too small (thin) of a ground wire. The radio ground wire in the auto makers dash wire harness was designed tohandle the power (current) requirements of the auto makers factory radio. Most auto makers factory radios willtypically draw less than 4 or 5 amps of power from the vehicles battery. The ground wire in the dash wire harness isbig enough to handle this small power consumption but it might not be big enough to handle many new replacementradios 5 to 10 amps of power consumption.Solution: Connect the new replacement radios ground wire directly to the metal of the vehicles frame andavoid using the original radios ground wire in the vehicles radio wire harness.For additional information on similar topics, please consult the following technical documents:999502 How To Eliminate Engine Noise (For Amplifier And Additional Audio Equipment Installations)999503 Road And Wind Noise (Alternate Methods To Fight Road And Wind Noises)999001 Basic DC Electronics For Automotive Applications (Voltage/Current/Resistance)999002 Car Audio Basics (How Mobile Electronics Integrate With Each Other)999003 Radio Install Basics (How Aftermarket Radios Integrate Into Electronics Of Vehicles)  --------------------------------------...

Maybe lower the suspension at this point if you still want to change it up a bit.
PAWpMzIlaa	I've read a lot of testimonials from Eclipse owners and almost everyone has agreed that when they used a good quality snow tire, the car drove wonderfully.

sCqdisvnaa	You need an adapter kit for the narrower aftermarket stereo, and a wiring harness adapter.  Crutchfield has them (see the link below for the faceplate adapter).
zruhNGKbaa	Shift kits are great!   ... BUT!    I prefer to customize my own transmissions, but unless you have Lotz of transmission experience it is not a task for you and most transmission shops do not have personnel trained in customization techniques and will not attempt to perform them, some shops will install a shift kit on your request at the same time as they perform a complete transmission reconditioning for a reasonable additional fee but they also will severely restrict or consider void most warranty's if this is done.       Unless your transmission has been reconditioned within the last 20,000 miles or less I would not recommend installation of a shift kit without reconditioning the transmission at the same time because the kit will make the transmission operate at higher hydraulic pressures which will be very hard on old seals and clutch assemblies.|`|6tE79dziaa	Sounds like krazybob's got you covered, lol.|`|kXUwDLgWaa	Why not|`|AA10471659	It will save wear on the clutchplates and steels It would be a very good thing to do. You go about 6000rpm and shift a pure stock th350 and it will have slippage in the clutch pack, not a good thing. the shift kit uses more pressure than stock and there is far less slippage. Take your drive shaft down and put some heavy duty spicer u joints in it for safety, that will be your weakest link

Thirteen Volvos in forty-one years, twelve outstanding cars and one pile of crap.|`|pNgsP3sLaa	Like the other posters said, modern day volvos are terribly unreliable and outlandish to repair. If you want a wagon, I HIGHLY reccomend the 850 wagon or 960 wagons, both range in years from 94-97. Both come in Turbo and standard versions, and both come in AWD, The 960 actually has a straight 6 engine, as opposed to the 850's V5. My boyfriend's 850 sedan hit the 280k mi. mark, before it was totaled by a drunk driver. :(  Up to that point, it hadn't cost him that much to repair... engine/transmission always performed well.    There's nothing wrong with old cars when you're talking about a volvo! ;)

You would NOT be required to wait a minimum time to schedule another test.    However, my recommendation for anyone who fails the drive test twice ~ get the help of a professional.    An evaluation by an instructor will likely solve the problem.  It's also written on the score sheet exactly which "critical error" resulted in the disqualification.  SAVE your score sheet to show to the driving school.    The drive test in Calif. is so ridiculously easy; that's why so many poor drivers are on the roads and why there are 50 - 75 crashes occur within San Diego County EVERY 24 hours.

You can find a car with 100,000 miles on it that's running good. Honda's can normally go well over 100K miles and still run good.     Keep in mind that you are a young driver and a new driver so you will pay an arm and a leg for insurance. Try to see if you can find someone who has been driving for years and is older to insure the car for you. The drivers training course is gonna do little for you b/c as I said before you are a new driver and due to your age. I wouldn't advise you to insure the car under your name.|`|Tsty9lcOaa	Stay away from the Saturn Ion. It's gotten god-awful reviews and constant recalls for it.

82wXvW3baa	If it's just some paint scratched off, it should be fine. But since your wiper fluid went empty, that means that objects inside the hood got damaged, and so the engine and radiator and other things may be damaged too. You should go to a mechanic and have them check your car for any problems.|`|kXUwDLgWaa	Should have it checked out there might be stuff you don't see right away|`|AA12339318	You don't always know the extent of the damage.

Some critical part may have been damaged, just enough to have gotten you home, but may be ready to fail, now.    Something happened to drain your wiper fluid.

The problem with this is the toxic fumes the battery gives of and (less important) the 60Hz hum you may get through the amp.

0CkFC43raa	if you are talking about using diesel fuel in a gas engine, no you cant. but if you are talking about using lubricating oil rated for diesel engines as a lubricating oil in a gas engine, then yes you can, but be aware that some additives used in diesel engines may not be compatible with some of the sensors or the catalytic converter in a gas engine, and can cause problems long term.      one of the ways to get an oil with higher amounts of ZDDP so prevent ruining flat tappet cams is to use diesel rated oil.|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	Any oil that is rated for a turbo diesel engine should hold up very well in a gas engine.

However, it is a great car all the way around. It drove really well (Handling curves, handling potholes, great mpg).<br>  I live where there's snow though and it was horrible in the snow so if that's the case for you, I'd advise against it.

fDDgFrtNaa	a catalyst is in your catalytic converter which is part of your exhaust system. it filters out and burns toxic crap that is being exhausted from your engine. these days, its illegal to drive a vehicle in most states without a catalytic converter, due to all the emissions laws and such. a catalytic converter works by catching the toxic crap coming down your exaust pipe in the catalysts and burning it by the extreme heat that is being accumulated by the exhaust. hope this helps clarify it to you.|`|FJWt3S6uaa	go to howitworks.com|`|B9NFOoKSaa	In chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that facilitates a chemical reaction; theoretically, at least, it remains unconsumed in the process. A catalytic converter, for instance, completes the process of combustion of waste hydrocarbons in the exhaust that would normally be expelled. In the days prior to converters, attempts were made to fine-tune the engine to encourage as lean-burning a condition as possible, but this dropped fuel mileage, raised nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, raised peak combustion temperatures, octane requirements & overheated exhaust valves. It was also tricky requiring complicated hosing & solenoids, etc. & additionally complicated engine management. When modern fuel injection & computer technology became more feasible, the fuel/air mix ratio could be optimized for efficiency & the resultant "dirtier" exhaust could be left to the converter; however, this also required unleaded fuel to avoid contaminating the oxygen sensor in the exhaust & the kind of careful fuel system management that only fuel injection could provide. This also allows the inclusion of a myriad of assorted "junk" hydrocarbon compounds that wouldn't meet the definition of "gasoline" in years past. I recall pumping 105 octane which looked like grape koolaid & smelled sweet like cologne. Today it reeks & is generally clear. The alcohol oxygenates make for cleaner emissions but leave additional carbon deposits in the engine, necessitating expensive additives & more frequent & extensive service. It also exacerbates a phenomenon known as "phase separation" but that is a topic best left for another Question.|`|MCFUmtFWaa	A catalyst is a type of chemical which are used to either speed up chemical reactions or start them. They decrease the energy needed in order for a reaction to take place. These are helpful for mixing things that will not under normal circumstances. An example would be enzymes in your body such as spit. This helps speed up the digestion of food.|`|AMrBUH1Iaa	they call it a catalytic converter. it is part of your exhaust system it so calls cleans the exhaust on the way to through the tail pipe.|`|a19fzzuDaa	a catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction|`|diDXWREOaa	a catalyst is something that speeds up the reaction process in a chemical process...i think what you mean is catalytic converter?<br>  <br>  well a catalytic converter is part of the exhaust system. It purifies the gases emitted through filters. Most cars emit nitrogen oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gases which are harmful to the environment. A catalytic converter reacts the left over nitrogen oxide (NO) with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is a less harmful gas. <br>  <br>  so basically, a catalytic converter cleans the gases emitted from the exhaust into more environmentally friendly gases (but still these gases are pollutants).

There has literally been no incident where a vtec engine died unless you blow the engine by driving in the redline for a long time.<br>  Mazda Rotary's are hard to maintain because they are completely different from Piston engines like the VTEC. Most people who buy Mazda RX cars break them because they do not know how to take care of them.<br>  <br>  Honda VTEC and Mazda Rotary both have the highest revving production cars. The Honda S2000 at a 9000rpm and the Mazda RX-8 at a 9000rpm redine.<br>  <br>  DOHC and SOHC are in piston engines like Honda's vtec. They mean double overhead cam and single overhead cam.<br>  <br>  Double Overhead Cam is better. It means it has the potential for more power.<br>  <br>  Which is faster depends on the car's weight and aerodynamics and tires.<br>  <br>  Mazda's RX-7 has 255HP and goes from 0-60mph in 5.5 seconds.<br>  Mazda's RX-8 has 238HP and goes from 0-60mph in 5.9 seconds(manual).<br>  Honda S2000 has 238-240HP and goes from 0-60mph in 5.7 seconds. It is lighter than the Mazda RX-8.<br>  Honda/Acura NSX has 290HP. 0-60mph in 5.2 seconds.<br>  <br>  So you see, it really has to do with the specific car to see what is faster.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Rotarys are faster than VTEC but they're a b*tch to take care of, and VTEC is really only useful for performance in the older Integra when Honda actually made sportscars. Nowadays you definitely can't go wrong with the manic 9000RPM motor in the Honda S2000, but I'd rather go with a Boxer engine as the first answerer has said. Purely and simply for the sound. Oh my fkn God the sound....|`|GKyjsNzjaa	How old are you? lol<br>  <br>  Rotary is faster, but a boxer engine is supreme.<br>  <br>  EVO <br>  Even an ordinary subaru impreza, outback etc.<br>  Plus there AWD which is better for travelly, raning conditioins, surfing, beaches, snow, etc.<br>  <br>  Plus you can just pretty much drive on any light weight road, you can rock crawl with it.

The current Mazda RX-8 has greta throttle response and excellent power, especially at high RPMs, at the same time it gets poor fuels mileage 12-18mpg for most drivers. Last I heard about the Honda Civic Si drivers were getting 25-30mpg as long as they left the engine stock. <br>  Faster generally is more related to torque and horsepower then anything else. If you compare two equal weight cars both front engine/front wheel drive(or fe/rwd) and the one with moe torque and HP should be faster. Gear ratios in the axle and transmission will affect these results strongly. Other traction aids such as a limited slip differential and the particular tires, especially the size of contact patch and how "sticky" the rubber compound is. <br>  No offense but you still have a lot to learn about engines. Or possibly you just need to hang around with and talk cars with people who are more experienced then the ones you currently are listening to. Example: the Honda VTEC motors are DOHC designs.<br>  <br>  -edit-  Life you might want to recheck your sources. The EVO is still an inline four as far as I know.

VuIxxJvqaa	First off, you need to check that the defogger is still working. Its more likely you have a blown fuse and the defogger is not working, rather than the light in the button going out.    If the defogger is actually working, you will find the globe will be a LED type, which most likely will be soldered in. Most switch lights are non serviceable, meaning you can't change them.    You would have two options, either buy a new/second hand switch or have someone wire in a separate pilot light that will illuminate when the defogger is turned on.

qpmGLd7laa	I don't know for sure, but I remember my high school chemistry teacher say "You can significantly increase the life of your engine if you warm up your car before driving."  I don't always do it, but I try to when it's really cold.  I noticed that when I just start driving, my car makes some weird noises, but runs well.  Otherwise, when I do warm it up, it makes no noise, but pretty much functions the same.<br>  <br>  Anyway, 1-2 minutes may be enough.

33ztb5CZaa	The Focus is the best bet here because it is small and fuel efficient. It is also very fresh and new making it look terrific. This car has a nice interior even though materials aren't great. And the technology in this car is better than the Mustang. The Mustang is a great car but its old. A new one is out for 2010 so you might want to wait for that, it is much more refined and has a better ride quality then the current model.

qxbOD0Z2aa	Yes, the same rules apply inside international airspace.    From the beginning the FAA has treated jets differently. In almost every area of certification the standards for jets have been more stringent than for propeller-driven airplanes, and one of those jet standards had been a requirement for two pilots. That rule remained in force until 1977 when Cessna won approval for single-pilot operation of its new Citation I-SP, and now many models of business jets are approved for single-pilot operation.    Most business jets are certified in the transport category because they have maximum certified takeoff weights greater than 12,500 pounds, the demarcation between large and small aircraft. One of the many certification rule changes between small and large aircraft is a requirement for at least two pilots in the large transport category airplane.    Its easy to understand why two pilots would be required in a transport airplane, given the greater complexity and generally higher performance. By their very nature transport airplanes are designed to carry larger numbers of people, or a greater amount of cargo, so there is a greater risk to a larger group, and certification theory has always demanded a higher standard as risk increases. Society, through the FAA, grants us wide latitude to take chances with our own lives, or with those of a few friends or family members, but that all changes when passenger capacity increases. Nobody wants to operate really large airplanes  including larger business jets  with a single pilot, but light business jets are a different issue. For many people a single pilot in a light business jet is enough.    It is understandable why some owners would want to fly their business jets without a copilot. The convenience of taking off when you want, staying as long as you want, and all other aspects of operating your own airplane are at least a little more complicated when you need two pilots. Single-pilot operation is all about flexibility and convenience. There is some cost to be saved by not hiring a copilot, but thats not a big issue. Besides, you almost certainly will pay more in insurance premiums than a qualified copilot would cost to hire.    Many business jet owners will argue that single-pilot flying is safe, but no sane person would say it is 100 percent as safe as with a well-trained crew of two professional pilots. But in all forms of general aviation flying we trade a small amount of safety potentiala second pilot, or maybe second enginefor convenience and availability. If we didnt make some small compromises on potential safety, we would all be on the airlines because they adhere to the most rigid, and potentially safest, standards.

qxbOD0Z2aa	Impossible to say without knowing how many hours the aircraft will fly each year and what the component times of the aircraft currently are.    The Learjet 45 has the direct operating costs of a light jet, like a Cessna Citation II (around $1,800 an hour);|`|AOPuoo16aa	That depends on the time the aircraft is used and allot of other factors.

43DHFQnKaa	a 9 p.s.i. installation would add 159hp at the crank (based on rated hp of the gt at about 260).  2lbs would add 36 hp at the crank.    if your engine is strong, but not enhanced and running on stock internals/stock heads you should not consider any installation beyond  380hp for this  4.6 profile, and this is a maximum boost of 7lbs.     you should  look at these companies as they make specific turbo installations for your mustang 4.6l 2 valve:  http://www.hellionpowersystems.com/direc...  http://www.turbochargedpower.com/  http://www.turbohorsepower.com/  http://www.bgturbokits.com/    quite frankly unless you are considering building out this engine and going to extreme limits,  a supercharger is likely a better installation - and makes the same power increase at the same boost level as a turbo.  a supercharger is :  -lighter  -runs cooler  -easier and usually far cheaper to install  -delivers power earlier and in a more linear fashion    your supercharger options are likely vortech, kenne bel, whipple, paxton.    whether you choose forced induction by turbo or supercharger you have to enhance your intake, exhaust, add new headers, and retune engine management system.    cheers 04 cobra, built out, supercharged, whipple 2.3 blower at  15lbs, measured on a dyno at 575rwHP  http://www.cardomain.com/member_pages/sh...|`|kXUwDLgWaa	Put twin turbos and send pictures while it's on the dyno|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	That's like asking what kind of HP nitrous would add. There are different size turbos which flow different amounts of air. Be less concerned with psi and more concerned with cfm, that's the amount of air you'll be flowing through the intake. Could be as little as 50, and as much as 300, all depends on your setup.|`|ozDl7KfRaa	a general rule of thumb is about a 10% gain in horsepower for every one pound of boost. STS makes a rear mount turbo but you would have to go with the universal kit b/c they dont make it for your year model.|`|HpwyYmoIaa	rule of thumb is 8 hp per every psi, not exactly accurate but close
bqLvWpcZaa	Yes, they'll fit ( I've seen it done ).  But the ride will be terrible as the you'll need rubber bands for tires and the car will be much slower due to the big increase in rotational mass of the 18" rims and the lack of low-end torque from the 2.0L engine.  Unless this is a show-car, I would not recommend this.|`|4582478b7ff4f7078ffcf80a107179c8aa	Use a tire/wheel calculator program (google to find a free one on the web) to make sure that your new tire/wheel package has, as close as possible, the same diameter are your original tire/wheel combo.  This will keep your speedo accurate and ensure that the tire does not rub on the spring seat.<br>  <br>  The crucial questions for Josh are RIM WIDTH and OFFSET.  <br>  <br>  In the rear, a rim too wide or a wrong offset will cause the tire sidewalls to rub either on the inside (against the strut tube and/or trailing arm) or the outside (against the fender lip).  Similar issues in the front.  You might be able to accommodate a wider tire by some combination of using a spacer (to move the wheel away from the suspension) and "rolling" the fender lip.  A fender roller can be rented over the internet.  I have done this on the rear fenders of my 99 Neon.<br>  <br>  Once you have a specific make, model, and size for your new tires and wheels, I suggest you post them on forums.neons.org to see if anyone on the forum can confirm your fitment.|`|FFUpnfq4aa	why spend more on rims than the car is worth
nftUxmr9aa	everyone answering this question before me is retarted. there isnt much difference between the actual engine other then the rx7 has a turbo and the rx8 is NA and makes a little more hp but loses some torque. you can add turbos to either engine to get some more power or get a 3 rotor kit, or if you want a real race engine you can get a 4 rotor kit and SINGLE turbo it which makes much more power and is more reliable then quad turbos on this engine. anyone who thinks otherwise is stupid.|`|mfHq20pqaa	LOL junk.  Buy a real car.|`|ukAvJjJSaa	RX7 is built to race, RX8 is more of a practical everyday use car with a good engine. This is what I assume.|`|qPmPAhiwaa	Rx7 is much more powerfull then the RX8. everyone with a rx7 laughs at the rx8 and everyone with the rx8 wishes they have a rx7    sadly the truth is the rx8 is a cute family version of the rx7. think of the new charger vs the old school chargers.    You can quad turbo the Rx7 if you want but be sure to put bags of cement in the back seat or you will have zero traction ;)      Rx7 driver for life.|`|XH4O3ozFaa	1st no turbo can be put on without thousands in mods plus turbo.  second there are many engines.  rotary, 4 and 6 cylinder with 2 4's so which one?|`|wRRZOT55aa	the RX7 comes with 2 turbos. the RX8 doesn't come with any. Dont mess around with any of these engines, they are not cheap to fix! a rebuild is around $3000!!!|`|g6easyBFaa	The basic design between the two motors are the same except for porting and different rotors.     On the old 13B the intake ports are on the side plates and the exhaust ports are peripheral type and are on the rotor housing.      The Renesis rotary engine of the RX8 is completely side ported.  the intake ports were moved a bit for better intake timing, and enlarged significantly for better intake filling. The exhaust ports were moved to the sides as well. They were also significantly enlarged for better exhaust flow.     The Renesis rotors are lighter and better balanced to allow them to rotate much quicker, allowing the 9000 crank shaft RPM red line.  Their compression ratio was also raised quite a bit to 10:1.     These changes allow the RX8's motor to produce 238 HP in naturally aspirated form, while the RX7 FD produced 255 HP, but required 2 turbo's to get there, not even a 20 HP difference.     Which is better to turbocharge?  The RX7's 13B is capable of producing more power. The RX8's Renesis porting allows for good emissions control and NA power but doesn't see the same gains when turbo or supercharging. You can still get great power from the Renesis, just not quite the same output for work involved.     There's really no such thing as an "extra rotor kit".  You must build a 20B engine from the ground up. The most expensive part is the specialized eccentric shaft built for 3 or 4 rotor motors. Because of the precise machining involved they cost several thousand $ each.

AA10024510	Lets try to clear up some misinformation about synthetic oil.  First, it is not truly synthetic.  There are no labs out there putting carbon molecules together one by one to produce oil, they are refining crude oil to a point far beyond conventional motor oil, then remixing the bases to get the particular characteristics they want.  Second, synthetics do not carry more additives than conventional oils, they carry the same additives in the same amounts (comparing same-brand conventional to synthetic, differing brands may have different formulas, but remember: if they are certified SM they effectively have the same protective characteristics).  Next, synthetic oil does not adhere better to metal, but some of the additives may help lubricate in extreme conditions.<br>  <br>  So what is true about the claims?  Synthetic truly is a better lubricant...by matter of degree not order of magnitude.  Synthetic does not break down as quickly as conventional...again, by degrees not magnitudes.  Synthetic does have better viscosity traits, and this is probably the biggest thing going for synthetics:  you can get 5w40 or 5w50 synthetics because they can make trade-offs with the high levels of refinement that can't be done in conventionally refined motor oils.  And the lows and highs are where damage happens to engines.  When I lived in Alaska, I swore by synthetics, because I knew they would protect my engine at negative fifty degrees.  Now that I'm back in the southwest, I'm OK with conventional oil, because I don't have to worry about the lows.  If I lived in Death Valley (where, ironically, I may be moving to next year) I might want the 40 or 50 weight top end...but not needing the 5w low end, I would still feel safe using conventional.  Race cars need the high and the low viscosities because A) they are built to higher tolerances than most engines, and then B) driven in harsher manners, so the lows means rapid lubrication in a cold engine, and the highs mean better protection during racing (think how quickly this temperature change happens on a quarter-mile track!).|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Yes. Synthetic oil is not made with petroleum products. It's man made and most of these oils ad-hear to all internal engine parts, whereas petroleum oil does not ad-hear to Internal parts, so the synthetic oil took longer to get broke down enough to allow engine damage.|`|xJgILr5faa	Well you teacher didn't tell you is that synthetic oil is us in all motorcycles and any air cooled engines it works even better than regular oil because it cools down parts that move in engine and carries lots more detergents than reg oil  it can take a lot stop and go that raise temps in engines. If you can lower your temp by any degree you adding life to your engine do you want your engine to last longer?Exaggerating teacher may have had a bad experience in the past and doesn't want any one to have what happend to him happen to you.|`|sEDGYy03aa	That might true that it stick to the parts better.  the one thing that is stupid about is how often do you not have oil in the motor.  <br>  <br>  I have seen synthetic withstand the punishment on racing.  A group of cars worked together because we did not have enough pit crew to help us.  We only have 4 guys in the pit with 3 cars.  Two Chevy and one oldsmobile motors in the cars.  One of the chevy had the synthetic oil.  The other chevy had Castrol oil.  Oldsmobile had Resolute.  Resolute is sold at Mills Fleet Farm and it is there cheapest oil.  <br>  <br>  The Castrol made about 12 weeks.  Resolute made it 10 weeks.  The synthetic was having problems with in the first night.  When they went to regular oil.  They did not have the problem.  The long periods were done with 2 year old motors and the other was brand new rebuilt.  <br>  <br>  Does the cost of the oil out way the benefits?

Tc2I7znMaa	If you try to wire the voice coils in parallel to the amplifier you will definitely over heat it as it will be running at 0.5ohms which is more than the amplifier can handle (2ohms). But you can do this quite easily without overheating by wiring the subs in series/parallel to the amp, with this wiring method you will be running the amp at 2ohms meaning that the amp will output 1000wrms (500wrms per sub). The power handling of your sub is 750wrms but 500wrms should be ample power.    Good luck,    Ben.

902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	When a car is shipped, it is billed to destination over whichever rail route will get it to where it is going, so the cars keep moving all over the nation from carrier to carrier.  The various carriers all share in the revenue, but attempt to keep the car on its own lines as far as possible, for a larger bite of the apple.    Since deregulation, shippers can offer lower rates to shippers if they can keep the car on their lines the entire way, even though the shipping may take longer.    At some interchanges, especially where time sensitive shipments are involved creating expedited schedules, the power is run through right along with the train.

qWmwI9PBaa	First of all it is NOT the fuse.  If it was, the light would not come on at all.<br>  <br>  The way the traction control system works is by utilizing the ABS sensors.  When it senses that any of the tires are spinning faster than the others it automatically applies the brakes to that wheel in order to slow it down.  That being said I would start by checking the ABS sensors.  Is your ABS light on?  If not, are all your tires filled to the same pressure?  Low air pressure will decrease the size of the tire causing that tire to rotate faster.<br>  <br>  The fact that it needs brakes could also be the cause.  If one of the brakes is grabbing more than another it will fool the system into thinking that wheel is slipping on the pavement.<br>  <br>  As for taking it to the chop to have them put the scanner on it, don't do it.  Take it to Auto Zone, and ask them to do it.  They will do it for free.  They do this in hopes that you will but parts to fix it there.<br>  <br>  Get the brakes fixed first before you address the traction control light.|`|h1mG6eI4aa	The traction control light only comes on when the wheels spin.. you should check your fuses.. thats a common problem..<br>  <br>  wat make and model is ur car

dx5HIXLPaa	It's hard to correctly diagnose something over the Internet.But if I have to guess,I would say the thermal actuator in the front differential is bad.    The actuator has 2 wires, in 4 wheel drive check for power at the red wire. and make sure the black wire has ground if both OK replace the actuator. (very common) 5 minute job, screws right in.    GM has a new type of actuator that replaces the old one, but it's more money and you need to purchase and install a harness to go with it. So if money is an issue, try to locate the old style (they're still available,but hard to come by)|`|d9ECb7N8aa	Wait a sec... I was all for Jesse's answer but you said that it doesn't work in 4LO right?    If the front tires pull in 4Hi BUT NOT in low then the thermal actuator on the front axle is NOT the problem. The problem is the switch/relay that drives the thermal actuator on the front axle. Now I haven't had to deal with this (yet) so I am unsure if what you need to be looking for is near the floor shifter or on the transfer-case.    If your front tires don't pull in Hi or Low range then there is a 95% chance that the thermal actuator on the front axle is the problem.    I will sniff around in my books when I get home and see what energizes that TLA on the front axle. I'm currently betting that there is a little limit switch or something on/in the transfer-case that has caused this.    I'm am basing my answer by how I understand your problem being that the front wheels pull in Hi but not in low range, correct?|`|oAh4f06Caa	your transfer case is out.your transfer case is like a little transmission for the front tires with out it they don't turn|`|vPDYTdrBaa	Jesse is write the actuator in the front differential .

yDJiiqcsaa	Yeah, like the others said - fuel filter. Remember that with old carbureted cars the fuel passed through the filter once and was burned. But with fuel injected cars the fuel that isn't used after going through the filter returns to the tank and is pumped back through again. That makes it so that when the filter is plugged - it is packed solid.  It may run at high RPM but not enough will get through at idle speed.  Replace the fuel filter and try to blow through the old one - I'll bet your eyes will bulge like a frog from the blockage.|`|jSPj3S6faa	Although Legacys are not known for this problem, a sixteen-year-old car with a cambelt could easily have a worn-out / broken cambelt.  This is the most likely cause of the trouble.|`|7TMjIDhUaa	i think its timing belt my suggestion is to go to shop and fix it|`|aHlkrZazaa	You need to check for fuel and spark.  Pull a fuel line, and see if any gas is getting to the engine while turning over.  Also pull a plug wire, and ground out an old spark plug to check for spark.  Most common fuel problems are plugged filter or failed fuel pump.  For spark, coil pack, sensor, or timing belt.  Also check the computer for any stored problem codes, as shown here http://www.autozone.com/az/cds/en_us/090...|`|ea96733d51e5b0005c9b96aa2dc4f0f3aa	Sounds like fuel pump. Listen for the fuel pump humming for about two seconds with key on.  Check for spuel and fark at the engine. Could be something as simple as a clogged fuel filter.

ZnvUJxA8aa	These are the RCA cables you need that go from the amp, to the head unit.    http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...    And to answer your question about the turn on lead (remote cable)...yeah you still that little wire as well, to go from the amp to the head unit. You need it because that is the wire that gets the signal to "turn on" or "power up" the amplifier when the head unit comes on.     Run the amp power cable on one side of your car or truck and then run the rca AND remote turn on lead on the other side. You need to do this because the rca cables will pick up interference from the power wire, and make the subs sound distorted and will have static.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	sometimes you dont, some amps have the turn on switch inside the amp, which allows the RCAs to give the signal from the head unit to the amp that the head unit is powered on, i am not so sure your amp has this feature.. you could try it, it wouldnt hurt to much

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	Headlight dimming is caused from a lack of current.  You will only be able to fix it with a big 3 upgrade and possibly an alternator upgrade if you are using a powerful system.    A battery won't help much unless your's is going bad and you don't have much of a dimming problem.  The batteries main role is to start the car and run the accessories when the car is off.  It plays a fairly small role when the car is running.    Bigger wires will only help if the wires you currently have are not large enough.      Big 3 information:  http://www.the12volt.com/installbay/foru...    ___________________________    This analogy should help you understand the charging system better:    Say you want to put out a fire. This fire needs 100 gallons of water per minute to be put out. Now say that the water system can only produce 80 gallons per minute. No matter how many fire hydrants you use you will only get 80 gallons per minute. The only way you will put out the fire is if you upgrade how much the water system can deliver. Unless it can put out 100 gallons per minute the fire will never be out. You could fill up all the buckets you want but you are still producing 100 gallons per minute.    To explain the analogy a bit...  The fire is your system. The water system is your alternator. No matter how much current your alternator puts out it won't be enough if it isn't as much as your system demands. You can use all the storage devices you want it won't help you put out the fire. The storage devices would be equivalent to the buckets. It doesn't matter how many buckets you fill up you still aren't producing enough power to put out the fire. You can add all the storage you want it won't help you deliver any more power to your system. The hoses are your power/ground wire. It doesn't matter how big they are it won't help deliver more power. It is bad if the hose is too small because then you aren't getting all the water system can supply.    Good Luck!!!|`|AA10906914	If your total system power is 1200 watts RMS or more,  you will need to:    1. Upgrade the "Big 3" - that is to replace (or add to) the power wire between the battery and alternator, the ground from the battery to the chassis and the ground strap from the engine/tranny to the chassis.    2. Upgrade to a yellow top battery    3. Upgrade the alternator to a high output alternator      Failure to do this will result in the early death of the alternator  as it will eventually fail.    Here is a guide that will calculate what size alternator and power wires you need  http://www.box.net/shared/uchv4dbk88    You will need Microsoft Excel. If you don't have Excel, use this link http://www.box.net/shared/nkkw1dhk4g    A second battery is never a good idea as it's an added strain on the alternator to charge two batteries AND supply power for the car. The ONLY time a second battery is useful is if the audio system is to be used with the car off.    A capacitor is only good so far as the audio system isn't trying to pull too much from the electrical system. A cap doesn't provide more power, it's designed to 'stiffen' the voltage to the amp, nothing else. If the current isn't there, a cap won't help.     The alternator must have at least 20% more amperage power than the entire vehicle and sound system combined for a cap to be of benefit which is ironically the same requirements for an amp to be efficient.     See my site for more info http://spkrbox1.spaces.live.com|`|199709a5ec6746be3dc19f7755f341e9aa	i had the same problem unitl i got a bigger alternator and a bigger batt. it fixed my problem!!!!!|`|UzQyb1hNaa	first off  some new amps have TECHNOLOGY that helps with it.   always use appropriate wire 4. ga will handle up to 1000  a HO alternator will help help keep a big battery charged  Finlay a cap will help in conjunction with a good BATTERY (it smooths out the draw allowing the amp to draw from a foot or 2 away rather than 17 ft.and allowing the battery to simply keep it charged)     imagine a cup with water slowly flowing in with most getting drank out  every few seconds vs. someone trying to suck the water they need through the hose faster than it wants to come (the cap is the cup)    so if your adamant at not getting a cap get a optima battery (yellow) and and a High output alternator|`|nVpnEhgOaa	you need a good battery|`|hIzULU3taa	Check these sites out...it is a good reference.    http://www.bcae1.com/  http://www.termpro.com/articles/articles...

Bl9zcqxQaa	Check your ignition system, most likely you have  a bad coil,  as they are very common.   It can cause very weak spark also in cold temps. and cause the car not to start at certain times.    Have a trained technician check it out, as you dont wanna guess and pay for unneccessary parts or repairs.|`|VuIxxJvqaa	If it is a carb motor, you may need to have your carb cleaned and put a kit through it.    If its a EFi motor, you may need to flush your fuel system and clean your fuel injectors.     Its possible it may also need a tune up with new plugs, wires, oil and filter, plus check your timing.

byFPLL4Taa	Manual transmission should be around 750 rpm.  Automatic should be around 850 rpm at idle, warm engine on both.  The RE is fuel injected so if the idle is out of wack I would suggest pulling codes on it to check to see if a sensor is going out or is problematic.  The next item would be to check to make certain that your timing is correct (had a timing chain issue??).  That can have an odd impact on idle if it is out several degrees.  You may need to check the thermostat also if it idles high but does not come down when it has warmed up.  The thermostat may be stuck slightly open and the temp sensor may read "not up to temp" and kick the idle up as it thinks it is still in warm up.  The last thing to have checked are the temp sensor(s) themselves (there may be more than one).  The temp sensor may not read correctly or respond with the correct voltage back to the computer...they do fail occasionally and the engine is 15 years old.  May want to check those areas over first as I always hesitated messing with a fuel injected engine's idle until I have ruled out the other possibilities first.  Other areas to check...TPS (throttle position sensor) and timing chain for any "stretching" issues that may have lead to the timing being off.  Hope that helps.|`|PE1k59pcaa	850 rpms

For example it may cost him $600 a year to insure the car under his name as the primary driver but list you as a secondary driver.

As long as you didn't steal the car you are considered a permissive insured driver on any policy on any car as long as you didn't steal the car. So to answer your question, your name doesn't need to be on that insurance or car, but most insurance companies require all licensed drivers to be a primary driver on 1 car on the policy.
oiW7wZkuaa	Your car has hydraulic lifters that use oil pressure to operate....they eliminate the the need to adjust valve clearances. Over time, as the car ages and especially if the oil hasn't been changed on a regular basis, some of the lifters will "leak down" to a point where you'll hear a soft "ticking" or "tapping" typically at idle. Oil pressure is lowest at idle and so if any lifters are not 100% you'll hear them tick. It's not a serious problem although it can get worse. I'm not a fan of the "repair-in-a-can" fixes for engine problems but....you can try one of the cans of oil additive that is designed to quiet lifters ....usually it is a concentrated mix of cleaning agents ...detergents ...and many times this will fix the problem. Keep the oil and filter changed regularly (3000 miles) and hopefully it won't get any worse.|`|zruhNGKbaa	It will require the use of a mechanics stethoscope to isolate and identify your noise.|`|Own0dhr0aa	check the PCV valve on the valve cover before you freak out to bad    if it was valve lashing it would tap through the RPM range|`|88bc02e78f8af966df066d8b6c93da26aa	Try replaceing the PCV vavle.

If you set up the corporation correctly, then your personal liability will be reduced - and that can really matter with trucks because lawsuits can get into the millions real quick.

AOPuoo16aa	Its a game and games have problems. You might want to try asking this in the games section you will probably get more responses,|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Assuming the sim is accurate, you probably have your aircraft configured incorrectly for climb and/or cruise.  You may be flying too slowly for your altitude and weight.  You may have attempted to climb at a constant rate after take-off, even though you should slow your climb rate as you gain altitude.  You may be trying to fly with flaps and/or gear extended.    The essence of the problem is that you cannot maintain the pitch you want at the speed you want at the altitude you want, so the aircraft oscillates in pitch because it is unstable in the attitude you're trying to give it.  As the pitch and altitude increase, the aircraft loses airspeed, until it approaches a stall and starts to pitch downward and accelerate, and then it repeats the cycle.  If the attitude of the aircraft is stable, the oscillations will diminish (with your help or the autopilot's help); if the attitude is unstable (unsustainable), the oscillations will persist or worsen until the aircraft has an opportunity to adopt a different, more stable attitude.    Assuming you're not asking the aircraft to put itself into an attitude that it cannot maintain (too high, too fast, too slow, etc.), you should be able to gradually level it out with judiciously applied control movements that dampen the oscillations.  If that doesn't work, change your target altitude/pitch/speed until you reach a zone of stability for the airplane.    If the autopilot cannot stabilize the aircraft (asuming that your oscillations are not too extreme), the attitude you're trying to attain is unstable. Aim for something else.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Is a very far aft CG being simulated?

gsQ2XN1waa	port work on the heads and intake along with a good exhaust system will bring about as much power as you are going to get along with an aftermarket cam if you can find one. Send the heads and intake to thumper performance if you want a really high quality porting and polishing job at a very reasonable price. you will need larger injectors and a tune for the pcm, and the stock fuel pump will work but upgrading would be a wise decision.<br>  <br>  With this done you should see about a 150-200 hp gain at the motor, about 100-135 hp at the wheels.|`|GKyjsNzjaa	No dont even bother please. Go for the exotic car look alike. <br>  <br>  You can add just ram air intake, or make it yourself, add chip "get rid of the 115 MPH Governor" add nice mellow/quiet sounding dual exhaust cat-back. Electrical MSD Ignition, sparks and wires.<br>  <br>  For the air intake, you can lower the intake down and make some kinda scoop under the car but be sure to put a steel or similar net in front and just have the filter where it is, change out with a higher performance mass air flow system.<br>  <br>  Change out the fuel pump to high flow system.<br>  <br>  Run it on alcohal.
AA12377112	I've had an 07 Charger R/T with Road and Track package for 1 year now and it is an extremely reliable car. Those who say it's crap have no idea what they're talking about. The only issue that I've had was the interior fan was replaced at 32,000 miles and I wish it had more power. I would definitely say have your brother test drive both the 3.5 and R/T because there really isn't much difference at all in the mileage between the two because the R/T has MDS which deactivates 4 cylinders when you're cruising. I think it goes on with less than 20% throttle. Transmission is also bullet proof, it's the same one that is used in the S-series Mercedes along with a few other drive train parts. I've got several friends with 500 whp in theirs and they have had no issues with their transmissions after thousands of miles.|`|1eXxGForaa	I work at a detail shop and have cleaned a few, the interior is small, and Dodge isn't exactly known for good transmissions and MPG, whatever you do don't buy a new one, only buy a used one with low miles.|`|zd1gQmzvaa	The charger sucks like every other american car...P.S.

They are not very practical for a family because the backseat is not very big (smaller than the Crown-Vic) The 3.5 has had alot of problems with the computer and the transmission fluid looked like really dark oil. The Hemi is the better buy but still i would go with a foreign car anything but a dodge.

Seriously, it sounds like this is an older Mercedes. The hissing might just be an exploded or punctured fuel hose. Should this happen, obviously there is no fuel pressure and you go NOWHERE. I find it hard to believe that the engine and starter have divorced themselves. If you hear the starter, the engine is usually turning with it. Unless the Bendix gear has failed. The other possibility is that your ignition just decided to die and stop firing plugs. Might be a bad coil. You go NOWHERE. You will probably need to have the car towed to a shop and have these things looked after. Could also be a vacuum line on manifold that jumped out of place. You go NOWHERE.What year and model and mileage?????|`|bQmMNG5vaa	Oh sounds expensive whatever it is ;)|`|GKyjsNzjaa	Transmission. Hissing sound. Oil pressure dropped.

M79W3Ct9aa	1.   Well you probably don't have a choice on where to find the car you're looking for.  You likely will only be able to get it from these guys if you can't find a similar company.<br> <br> 2.  What I mean by this may help understand how difficult the process is.  When you import a car to the US, it has to meet all the emission requirements and related things and changed to US Specs like the US cars so the car can LEGALLY be driven on US streets (I think the exception is if the car is at least 25 years old).  Anyway, to meet emissions, that means exhuaust needs to be changed up to US Specs(Japan doesn't have as strict requirements so their cars are usually more powerful stock, don't believe they use cat converters), speed limiter likely needs to be added, may need airbags installed, 3rd brake light, OBD II or OBD I needs to be installed, etc. etc.  Also, these costs are passed down to YOU, in addition to the cost of the car itself.  <br> <br> This is why you can't import a Nissan Skyline legally into the US.  Motorex (I think?) is the only company that did it and is no longer in business.  They also hold the data and rights on converting the Skyline to US specs so basically no one else is allowed to try.<br> <br> I doubt this company is gonna try to screw you out of your money since its not as simple as "buying the car, they bring it here, you drive it two days later."|`|PZOyNlKaaa	Mmmm I′m dreaming with a Viper although I love Mustang.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	First, you better find out if US Customs will allow the car to be brought in the USA.  I may not qualify due to safety & pollution regulations.<br>  Secondly, you're gonna pay that amount of money without seeing or checking the car out?!!!!<br>  Should any issues arise, you're gonna have a heck of a time attempting to reach a resolution on an international transaction.<br>  Too much risk.|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	You can't import a car to the US without an importers license. Might be a good idea to realize first that that car was made to japanese specs. It will not pass our crash tests, pollution tests, etc. You might get it in the country, but it will be deemed as "off highway use only."
uUHYklTAaa	It's not really about safety, it's the coolness factor. Many riders from both groups will dress appropriately with all the proper gear but what you're talking about is just for style. Harley's and leather vs race replica bikes and race style helmets. And yes I know racers wear full leather but full race leathers are expensive and a helmet is the cheapest way to accent the "look".  Back in the 80's I crashed a Harley. Bruised ribs, sore hip and leg, no road rash, leathers wouldn't have helped much. Knocked out cold, a helmet would have helped. But 20 plus years later I still don't wear a helmet when I ride my Harley but wear one most of the time when I ride my sport bike only because I ride it a lot harder and I know my risk of crashing is greater.   As for leather, depends on the weather, not what I'm riding.   T-shirt, usually.   Shorts, rarely, usually jeans and boots.  I don't give a rats *** about style. I wear, and ride, what I want, cool or not. To short answer your question, it's all about each groups style.|`|FDeoPn89aa	you forgot to mention the chaps on the Harley rider or the flip-flops on the sportbike rider.    I think it has to do with the Government mandating helmet usage. People tend of think of motorcycles as instruments of non-conformity, so they wear novelty helmets, or wear a full face, but no other gear.    I think if the Government repealed helmet laws, and "strongly advised" riders not to wear helmets, or full gear, then these guys would probably rebel - by wearing full face helmets and full leather gear.|`|AA11079528	Yea, each sorta defeats the purpose doesn't it.  Why does a bear crap in the woods, it wants to.  Bout as good an answer as there is.|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Think before you get wild.1963 at Willow springs raceway I saw a man fall off the down hill portion on the back side of the track at 110 mph.He slid for about 100 yards and when he came to a stop his right rear butt cheek was ground down to the bone.It didn`t have to happen.He chose to race.I decided that day that I would never follow in his foot steps.It is more dangerous out on the road,because people will run over you.Wear protective gear and ride safe.|`|3qenINMHaa	sportbike riders wear full face helmets because they're embarassed to be seen on them,|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Simple logic, actually.    I don't own a motorcycle, but I have friends that do, and have observed them.    At highway speed, if you're launched off a bike, you're pretty much going to die. That's the bottom line. Nice helmet, or no helmet, there's only one outcome. Necks snap, vertebrae snap, etc. Head injuries are just a minor part of it.    Also, the way the bikes are handled, is different. Cruiser type bikes don't flip, or launch people, so much as they collide and just wreck. One of my friends was in a wreck, and the bike basically absorbed most of the impact. Got some road rash, but that was about it.    And he's an ambulance EMS. If it really provided a ton of protection, he'd be the first to wear it. But it's really just marginal.    The argument, of course is that it may mean that 1 out of 10 might live, instead of all 10 dying. But for those other 9, it doesn't really make their odds change any.|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	Personal choice.    BTW, brain damage is not guaranteed.  Road rash almost always is, to some extent.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Cruisers lean out of head on positioning while bullets lean in. Projectile force in bullet position verses sliding force or drag in laid back position.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	Hadn't noticed all riders of either class doing those things.|`|84fm2GXOaa	beacuse everyone wants to "look cool"|`|n7jXAQFWaa	It's lack of proper training, lack of desire for personal safety or a combination of both. Both groups of riders are subscribing to a style more than a means of protection all around. The full face helmet is more of a style thing than protection just like the leathers on a cruiser rider. To be fair, the cruiser riders are probably closer to being right than the sportbike guys, as all they would need is a 3/4 helmet to meet most reasonable protection guidelines.     Death is not a certainty but being thrown from it is a possibility in a bike crash regardless of the type of bike. That's a statistical fact.|`|H9PeHFgbaa	A lot of it has to do with the 'biker persona'. If you wear a full-face helmet no one can see how 'cool' you look. Additionally, everyone knows that a full-face helmet provides a significant increase in protection over a beanie or even a 3/4 helmet. Basically, according to the manufacturers, the MSF, law enforcement, etc., if you don't wear a full-face helmet, you may as well not be wearing one... they will provide some protection but it's minimal.    I don't ride sport bikes, but know a lot of folks who do. Very few of them ride in less than at least long pants, T-shirt and a helmet. I have seen many riders with shorts, tank tops and flip-flop sandals. The way I look at it is that if they're at least wearing a helmet they are aware of safety and if they choose to ignore 'armor' that's certainly their choice.|`|BQPM0yROaa	I don't know man. I wear a full faced helmet on my cruiser and my sport bike. Usually the rest of the clothes are pretty much what I'd wear everyday except for the leather jacket. Interestingly my dad was wearing a novelty half helmet when he went down on his sport/standard suzuki bandit and the helmet actually saved his head so I'd say they're actually quite useful.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Damn good question dude.|`|48eb2dbb79fba479784347026d54127daa	I've been riding for 50 yrs without a helmet or leather, when I dump it, I want it all.

VuIxxJvqaa	It would depend on the coarseness of the file and also the thickness of the alloy panel.    If you used excessive pressure, you could buckle or crack the panel, if it is thin.    If you file too much away, you will have a low spot, that you will need to fill with either body filler or a high fill type primer.    You could also make the panel too weak, so that it flexes or cracks, depending on the type of panel.|`|AA10494884	First are you sure the panel is aluminum?

RbsRpcIyaa	DO NOT stop payment on the check. You signed an agreement that you would provide legitimate funds for the sale. You can be arrested and sued.

Call the dealer first thing in the morning and calmly try to work something out with them.     **Side note -- The BBB is powerless in these situations. They have no legal authority and are nothing but a complaint registrant to the member. If you register a complaint through the BBB, they will deliver it to the dealer, but nothing more.

As far as the STI goes, it's a far better car than the previous models.  For a price increase of $1500 base, you get dual AVCS which helps the turbo spool much better and faster, I-Drive which lets you adjust the throttle response to save on fuel depending on what kind of driving you are doing, and the new suspension set up and geometry allows the car to ride much more comfortably while allowing more grip in the turns.

You can probably get about a 2001-2004 for that price. I have to admit though, they're a bit unimpressive after a while of driving them.    Have you checked out a VW GTi, Subaru Legacy, or the Acura Integra/RSX? Depending on where you live, you can probably find a 2001-2004 in all of them for about 7k. The integra was discontinued in 2001, then came along the RSX. The GTi is fun to drive, but the maintenance is a bit expensive, and the parts are too.    Test drive them all out, and test your haggling skills :). With the economy the way it is, you should be able to haggle down a car a couple hundred, if not a thousand from the asking price|`|US0l3MZWaa	I dont know, im from Canada eah|`|Tsty9lcOaa	I've always heard good things on the Honda Prelude. Sporty, come in manual, offer a decent amount of power, and the Honda name never hurts. Look at those, around year 2000 or 2001. If you want newer, then you'd have to "settle", aka give up either the sporty or fast aspect. It depends on your style and how reluctant you are. If I were you, take a look at the Prelude.

n7jXAQFWaa	Rubber isn' a conductor and will not act as a grounding strap. That's the reason your tires aren't solving your problem already. The problem is that your potential is different than your car or the physical ground, I can't tell by your description of the problem. You either need to electrically bond yourself to the car's chassis by always touching something metal or the car to the physical ground like mentioned before with a frayed wire underneath your car.     That or spray an anti-static product on your upholstery.|`|BNlSh53faa	What I did was attached a small piece of cable, frayed the ends, and attached to the car so it would touch the road.  In my present car it doesn't happen as bad.  It was so severe in my Honda civic, it got frustrating.  The cable helped but I would add a grounding strap, the kind they use on trucks.|`|VuIxxJvqaa	It could be as the first person suggested, your clothes rubbing on the seat creating static electricity!     What you can do is to fit what is called a anti static strap, or a grounding strap.    Its essentially a piece of rubber that attaches to your car and runs down onto the ground, so the static is grounded out instead of jumping onto you.    They are cheap and easy to fit and might save you a shock!|`|Hu4sEk2Faa	You have a lot of static electricity built up in you. It could be from the clothes you're wearing.|`|zruhNGKbaa	In dry weather static electricity is formed when your clothing rubs against the fabric of the seat. The static charge is discharged when you touch any metal part as you climb out of the car.    The best method I have developed to prevent big painful shocks is to place one hand on the metal of the door and hold it tightly when climbing out of the car - the charge will dissipate slowly that way instead of slamming you all at once when you touch the door to close it.
HpwyYmoIaa	i wouldnt ever get a honda, you could look for a 2000-2005 eclipse if you can find one in your price range they are very reliable and you can find some of the earlier ones in your price range, they last past 200k miles without and problems most of the time. ive owned one for 4 years without a single problem and i know many others who have, if you notice that you never see wrecked hondas is because they are cheaply made and if they get hit that are completely totaled so if you can help it dont get one of them|`|YRHLMfzDaa	acura integra or 96-2000 honda civic or mitsubishi eclipse|`|YxOPA3eGaa	Go do some research kid, Its never too late or too early to learn!

rmHuvl75aa	Edwards, how does 2 12's perform better than 2 15's? You do ralize that the difference is cone area and low end response. It also depends on how the sub is built and what it is built to do. I have 18's that sound better than 10's and I have 10's that are louder than most 18's. It is all in the build and quality of the woofer.    Kicker and most mainstream brands are chinese woofers and perform the same with most having poor build quality and sound.     What is your budget for amp and 2 15's? feel free to email me for direct help...  lowhz01@yahoo.com|`|xtOjABiGaa	One CVX 15 is 1000rms. So two would give you 2000rms. You need a amp that produces between 1500-2000rms at the correct load 1ohm,2ohm, or 4ohm. You need to give alittle bit more info. What are the subs? 2 or 4 ohms DVC.And yes you would have to upgrade.    Performing a "Big 3" upgrade on your vehicle is one way to improve the electrical system performance and its ability to supply power to your audio system.  This upgrade will help any vehicle using an after-market amplified stereo system, and most certainly should be performed on any vehicle after a high-output alternator is installed.    Please be sure you read and understand this entire instruction before you begin.    Definition: The "Big Three" upgrade means improving the current capacity of three cables: 1) alternator positive to battery positive, 2) battery negative to chassis, and 3) engine ground to chassis.  Some people replace the factory wiring; others add additional cables to the factory wiring.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	if your gonna go with 2 kicker cvx subwoofers    go with 2 12 inch cvx subs, not 2 15 inch, 12s will perform better then 2 15s and also sound better as well      ___________________________    2 15's have longer response time than 2 12"s would|`|dRozk0cCaa	well if you get 2 than go with the kicker 1500.1 or the mtx te1501d if you get one than the kicker 750.1 should be fine.
VuIxxJvqaa	Its unlikely you will get one anywhere else other than a dealers.    Its still a new car and the part would not be popular enough for someone to make a aftermarket type one.    Your best option is to remove the panel before you damage it any further. A body shop may be able to repair it with glue, bondo or something like that. If you or someone you know is good working with fiberglass, they could probably help you fix it cheaply enough.    It would be a good idea to order new screws or clips from the dealer though, most times they are plastic and when you remove them, they are easy to damage, or they are broken.    It should be a easy fix.|`|AoA5zhrFaa	Unforunately, you're not going to find the belly pan for that car in the aftermarket world.  The belly pan isn't all that expensive, I just called the parts department at the VW Dealership that I work at, a new belly pan will cost you exactly $82.06 and you can put it on yourself.    When you go to pick it up just make sure to get the correct metal clips and the T25 screws you will need to put it all back together.  Most of the ones that originally came with your car are probably still on there, so be sure to check before you go in.    To take the old one off and put the new one on you will need:  a Torx T25 screwdriver and something to get the VW off the ground.  Once you're under the car, it's pretty self-explanatory how to do it.    Hope this helps!
d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	It is difficult to rent a car if you're under 25. However, some rental agencies will allow one to rent a car if you're under 25, providing that you pay an additional daily surcharge. For most agencies/states, the minimum age is 21, while a few may go as low as 18. If you can rent through an employer/group plan, you may also be able to rent.    http://www.bnm.com/uage.htm a good site to help you find such agencies and compare the surcharge rates in major cities, as is http://www.autorentalguide.com/car-renta...|`|IyfspYM8aa	To heck with all of them...23 is not underage.

5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	Funny. Ask the dealer what store sells MP3 formatted CD's. I've never seen store bought MP3 CD's.  The stock unit is made by For Electronics and Engineering. The reason it won't play burnt CD's sometimes is probably because most stock systems are notorious for having cheap, weak optic lasers used in the CD mechanism. You can try using a good quality CD lens cleaner in the unit or use different colored blank CD-R's when you burn them. Different color discs reflect different lasers either stronger or weaker. Some lasers work well with one color but not another.
U24VtSlZaa	Don't know why it would have 4 wires unless each lamp is independent of the other.  If that's the case, you can tie them together, 2 and 2, because under no circumstances should you ever illuminate one without the other.  Between sunset and sunrise, or if visibility is limited by cloud cover or fog, while not moored or anchored, both red and green must be on, never one or the other.    It might have helped to know the color of the wires, in case someone might be able to decode their meaning.    Are they LED lights?  If not, polarity doesn't matter, but you need to find out which two wires go with each light.    The wiring goes as follows:  tie one wire from each bulb to a good ground, and the other to the switch.  the other post of the switch should be wired to the fuse box;  a 3-amp fuse should do it, but not higher than 5.      If you don't have a fuse box, run that wire to the battery (+), with an inline fuse holder about six inches from the battery.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	If you have four wires running forward there is a possibility that the extra wires were there  for additional equipment such as search light.   You only need  two wires for the lights.regardless of the color the positive wire should go to the center contact in the light bulb  socket. the ground goes to the side of the socket itself   the positive wire coming from the switch should be fused for safety. the negative side does not need to be fused. good luck|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	really all one need is hot wire and ground wire shouldnt be that hard to see which is what touch one to pos on battery anothe rto groun dlight come on  you got two right|`|AA11432856	What are the colors Black is usually ground  brown is usually running lights.|`|I7NkFJo2aa	http://easyacdc.com/    That does seem like it is a LED type light to have four wires needed.    Any wiring you do must NEVER use any part of the boat as earth, or your boat could dissolve within hours or days should stray current find it's way outside the circuit.  A fused positive and a negative feed should be led from a switch at your controls up to the bow lights, taking care to prevent any possibility of chafing or crushing.      Without seeing the light it is hard to say how to proceed specifically

RIDE IT LIKE YOU STOLE IT|`|fbxqLErlaa	Earth Boy is dead wrong.  1200 cc sport bike is a terrible and potentially dangerous machine for a beginning rider.  A beginning rider does not need a machine with a top speed of 170 mph plus.  Also insurance costs will be huge.  Vast majority of sport bikes are not suitable for beginners.  Here is one of many reasons.  Most sport bikes have a tall first gear.  Meaning it takes a fair amount of clutch slipping and throttle coordination to get rolling.  This takes skill and experience, something beginning riders do not posses.  Please read article below.  Take a look at a v-twin bike with upright seating.  Note, there are other motorcycles besides Harley that offer v-twin engines.  Suzuki DL-650 V-Strom with available ABS brakes is a good beginner's bike.  Sadly, no manufacturer market a machine geared for a beginner.  Attend a Motorcycle Safety Foundation rider school.  best money and time you will ever spend.  Good Luck|`|fl60KL8oaa	Which sport bike is best for beginners?  NONE!  Sport bikes have highly tuned engines with terrific high end, pitiful low end, and a narrow torque band.  A standard in sport bike guise would be a better choice.    Where and how you intend to use the bike means more than your size.  For knocking about town, zero highway, 125-225cc would be ideal.  For mostly town with some freeway, the various 250's are fine.  For cruising on two lane country roads, again a 250 is sufficient.  But if you intend to spend any length of time on freeways/interstates then you'll likely be wanting something in the 500-650cc range.    As for your other question:  Lighter = Easier to Manage.    For a given displacement, dirt bike are lightest, followed by dual sports, sports, with cruisers on the heavy side.  But as true with anything, there are exceptions.  My 650 cruiser is lighter than a 650 standard: http://www.powersportsnetwork.com/enthus...      But bottom line, about the best beginner bike, in general, is the baby Ninja, 2007 and earlier.  (They made it bigger and heavier and 33% more expensive in 2008.)  The older 250R is reasonably light at about 300 pounds dry, fairly smooth power, capable of city, country, or interstate.  There are people who never see a need for a bigger bike.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	if you know what you like go to any dealer and sit on a few bikes your butt wil know the right one if it feels right or not you will just know it|`|ITVmfrWOaa	Cruiser or sport bike or dual or dirt?    for cruiser i would say Honda shadow  for sport bike i would say Suzuki sv650|`|BQPM0yROaa	Any Japanese 650 dual sport or maybe an sv650 if you're fairly disciplined and absolutely NEED a sport bike to start on. I personally started on a 650 dual sport.

Buy a used bike.  If you have never ridden before go to a MSF course.  They use Honda 250 Rebel's and Suzuki 250's.    Think seriously about buying a used bike.  Look on Craigslist instead of eBay.  Go to some shops and sit on them, see what you like and what fits you.  Don't get caught up in the looks of the bike.  What you want is something to learn on.  You can always get the dream bike later.  Wouldn't it be a sin to get that shiny new bike and tip it over, fall over or bang it up.    Just my opinion.|`|MDzPFiUCaa	The ZZR 1200. It is awesome!!!    The Kawasaki ZZR?1200 motorcycle provides the streetbike enthusiast with a superb balance of big-bore performance matched to the sport-touring comfort necessary for long distance rides.  Kawasaki engineers based the ZZR1200s double-overhead cam 1164cc inline-four engine after the muscular ZRX1200, but modified the ZZRs 16-valve engine to be a stronger performer in the low- and mid-range sections of the powerband. The ZZRs aluminum cylinders utilize chrome composite plating rather than cylinder liners to provide a lightweight package and quick heat transfer. The actual pistons feature reinforced ribs similar to those on the NINJA ZX-12R sportbike. Actuating the valves are sintered-tipped rocker arms, which ensure less wear and friction and provide optimum lubrication. Meanwhile, a balanced crank helps bring out the engines torquey personality.    Providing efficient fuel flow, the ZZR1200 uses twin fuel pumps that feed four Keihin 40mm downdraft carburetors equipped with the Kawasaki Throttle Responsive Ignition Control (K-TRIC) system. In turn, an alternator produces more output to power the dual fuel pumps, as well as the stylish and functional dual headlights on the ZZR. To keep things cool, the ZZRs radiator is equipped with two fans.    While the ZZR1200s engine performance crosses boundaries uncharted by other sport touring machines, the same can be said for its chassis. The aluminum perimeter-style frame is reinforced with internal ribbing to withstand mass miles of sport touring. Meanwhile, a steel subframe accommodates saddlebags available through Kawasaki Accessories or color-matched luggage offered by Givi.    To give the ZZR1200 the light-handling nature associated with sport-touring bikes, ball bearings are used in the steering head to maintain a light-steering feeling. Also, the lightweight swingarm is designed relatively low to improve traction. Kawasakis UNI-TRAK? rear suspension system produces progressive rates on the shock for an overall smooth ride.    Bringing the ZZR1200 to a stop are opposed four-piston calipers, which grip 320mm dual-discs in the front, complemented by a 250mm rear disc brake.    A comfortable riding position gives the ZZR1200 all-day touring capacity, and an attractive instrument panel displays pertinent information, including fuel level. Finishing touches include an elegant, contoured fuel tank and sleek-looking twin-beam headlights. Hollow-spoke wheels, a one-piece fender and clear, automotive-style turn signals round out the ZZR1200 sport-touring package.      Features and Benefits    Four-Cylinder, 16-Valve Engine  - Aluminum cylinders with chrome composite plated bores reduce weight, resist wear and offer superior heat dispersion    - Pistons feature reinforcing ribs similar to those in the NINJA ZX-12R sportbike    Downdraft Carburetors with Kawasaki Throttle Responsive Ignition Control (K-TRIC)    - A throttle-position sensor monitors engine load so that its micro-computer can determine the best ignition timing for more power and better fuel economy    Dual Fuel Pumps    - Dual fuel pumps provide a steady fuel flow to cylinders    - One pump feeds cylinders one and two, while the other feeds cylinders three and four    Liquid Cooling    - Maintains consistent engine temperatures for long engine life and sustained power during hard use    - Equipped with twin fans    Sintered-Tipped Rocker Arms    - Provide longer wear, less friction and better lubrication    Aluminum Perimeter-Style Frame    - Thick frame rails provide extra rigidity    - Rake and offset designed to provide nimble handling    - Steering head incorporates internal reinforcement ribbing    - Steel subframe accommodates aftermarket saddlebags    Bottom-Link UNI-TRAK?

XVGmGCDaaa	If you are a first-time New Mexico licensee age 18 to 24 you will be are required to take the "None for the Road" self-study DWI awareness class. First, a) complete the "None for the Road" course; then b) take your certificate of completion and other required identification (see question  5), to any Motor Vehicle Division Field Office to apply for your license. Note: Individuals who are age 25 or older are generally not required to take the "None for the Road" course.    The "None for the Road" course is administered by UNM Continuing Education, not by the Motor Vehicle Division. Information about the course and a course application are available on-line or by phone from 8-5 Monday through Friday at 277-0051 in Albuquerque and surrounding areas, or toll free at (877) 663-7465. You may also obtain a "None for the Road" flyer/application directly from any local Motor Vehicle field office.    If you have a current driver's license from another state, or are applying for a first time New Mexico driver's license, you will be required to pass an eye exam. Written tests are required for all applicants who are applying for a first time driver's license or for those whose licenses that have been expired for one year or more. Road tests are required for first time applicants or those with licenses expired over 5 years. A license will not be issued if your driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, or denied by this state or any other state.    The fee is $18.00 for a four-year license or $34.00 for an eight-year license. Drivers who are 75 years old or older must renew their licenses yearly, but they are not charged renewal fees.    State law now requires a DWI records check on all drivers moving to New Mexico from out-of-state. To pay for the records check, those drivers are charged an additional one-time $15.00 fee, increasing their total to $33.00 for a four-year license or $49.00 for an eight-year license.    From looking at the Driver's Handbook (second site below), it doesn't look like you need driver's ed first.|`|Ym8QCBOSaa	Well PM - i had NO idea you were in NM.

KaQLLLXfaa	Theoretically no as you require eye test,medical, etc. But there are agents from whom your relatives can get the forms to be signed by you and 2 photos.The driving license will get renewed.

NdlgA13Kaa	just replace it and dont waste your time|`|Hc0vjK5laa	re-adjust the sensitivity on the amplifier.....and check your speaker box for leaks......this is more financially sensible to do.....and if this does not help then purchase new...if it does work......YOU SAVE $.....
uDuwc7Yoaa	1. dual voice coil means you can treat each set of terminals on the subwoofer as a separate 4-ohm speaker (4 ohms for these subs, could be different for others) when connecting it to your amp.  2. For these subs, 400 watts rms will be 200 per voice coil and 600 peak per voice coil  3.sensitivity is just the relative loudness. it basically means the higher the db spec, the less wattage it will take to get the sub to a certain loudness.  4. power handling is how many watts the sub is rated to safely use, without being ruined by a fried voice coil. power handling is rated per speaker, so 400watts on a DVC sub means 200 per coil
Hc0vjK5laa	A dual voice coils sub allows the installation of multiple speaker to a single or multiple amplifiers.    RMS watts are the continuous power handled by a speaker...Peak is a short burst amount.    Woofer sensitivity, the higher the cleaner the sound    Power handling is same as RMS|`|AA10906914	Well, the above answer is close...    A dual voice coils just has two coils instead of one. This allows for more wiring options to the amp for different ohm loads.    NEVER connect to multiple amplifiers unless the amps are "strappable".    RMS (Root Mean Squared) watts are the nominal or continuous power handled by a speaker. Same as power handling.    Peak or Max is a short burst amount, however, these are arbitrary ratings with no real world value. This is because there is no standard to measure them.    Woofer sensitivity or efficiency (measured in dB or SPL[Sound pressure Level]) depicts the loudness of a sub.    The sensitivity of a sub is the SPL output the sub will have with 1 watt of power at 1 meter. For each doubling of power, you get a 3 dB gain in volume or SPL.    Example:    Sub "A" is 1000 watts RMS/85dB  Sub "B" is 500 watts RMS/95dB    Sub "B" would actually be louder than sub "A" because the sensitvity is higher even though the power handling of sub "A" is higher.    Power---Sub "A"--Sub "B"  1 watt = 85dB = 95dB  2 watts= 88dB = 98dB  4 watts = 91dB = 101dB  ....  500 watts = 110dB = 120dB  ...  1000 watts = 113dB = -------    Even at 1000 watts on Sub "A", Sub "B" still pushes more dB with only 500 watts.    This is only an example and does not indicate actual dB output as this will depend on many factors such as enclosure used, cabin gain, etc.    See my site for more info http://spkrbox1.spaces.live.com
wpgRMjgraa	21% of fatal car crashes involving teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19, were the result of cell phone usage.     This result has been expected to grow as much as 4% every year.     These results, as stunning as they may be, can be avoided with proper care while driving.     The most common distracting activity is using a cell phone or other wireless device such as a BlackBerry. CTIA, the international association of the wireless telecommunications industry, reports that wireless communications devices are found in 81 percent of households and more than 255 million people now subscribe to wireless services in the United States.     Experts estimate that as many 73 percent of drivers use their cell phone.     6% of traffic accidents (636,000 motor vehicle collisions) that occur each year happen because someone was using a cell phone.     ? 330,000 people were injured in these accidents.    ? 12,000 of the injuries were serious.    ? 2,600 people died in auto collisions that involved cell phone use.|`|83b60f2fdd03f49375b7489077add40baa	Type in "cell phone related..."  on your search engine of choice and you will find all sorts of info.

But you must take in consideration what the min ohm rating of the amp is. When you hook up 2 speakers like that it will drop your ohms in half.  EX.  100 watt amp   2ohm stable    your speakers must be 4 ohm speakers all 4 of them.    if the amp is 4 ohm stable  speakers must be 8 ohm speakers.    hope this helps..

Its probably your Coil or a wire somewhere related to that.    Coils are usually the ONLY part on a car that cannot get real wet or even condensation CAN cause sputtering or stalling.      Check all spark plug wires and Coil for water...AFTER you disconnect the battery first!!!!      Also a loose Ground wire can cause immediate stalling.

TdrgZwnoaa	NO! It does not make it safe.     When I drive on ice I drive as if I had no brakes whatsoever. Might as well, since I am not going to use them anyway unless I absolutely have to. Even with ABS you cannot stop in a reasonable amount of time or space. Many ignore that fact at their own peril.     The only way to be safe on ice is to slow the H3LL down. I live in a part of the country where the roads are ice covered all Winter ( too cold for salt and sand just blows off the roads). We do not go careening around at the speed limit, we slow down. There hasn't been a serious road accident around here in the Winter for years.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The friction between the brake shoes and pads is only as good as the friction between the tires and the road.|`|WAGpAh8oaa	no because brakes dont contact the drive surface. tires do. if you have good tires, friction is greater so it would be safer. brakes have nothing to do with it.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	not much of anything drives good on ice brakes good or not and tires are better on wet roads as much as brakes good brake anytime is a good thing wet or dry  safe to drive with in speed if brake are good anytime wet and ice just drive slower|`|AA12339318	Even poor brakes can stop the car's wheels from turning on an icy road.    The problem is that the wheels can stop, but if the road is slick, either from ice or water, or even wet leaves, the tires can simply skid on the surface and NOTHING can stop the car, except, perhaps, a tree, a snowbank, or another car.  If nothing gets in the way, then the car will slow down enough for the tires to get some traction.    That's why it is advised that people don't brake hard when slowing down or stopping on icy roads.  You don't want to "lock up" the wheels.  Doing this can result in losing traction.  Vehicles equipped with ABS brakes will "pump" the brakes, alternating very quick pulses of braking, turning, and braking sequences to prevent the wheels from locking up.    But the real, ultimate solution to minimize the chances of skidding on wet or icy roads is to, simply, drive slower.  The lower the speed of the vehicle, the less energy the brakes need to stop the car.  At slower speeds, light pressure on the brakes can safely stop the car.|`|UNUJNgHxaa	Brakes have one purpose. That is to stop the car. Icy roads do not rely on brakes they rely on traction. Traction comes from one place, TIRES. If you have good tires that are designed for the icy conditions then you are safe. Well safer then NOT having good tires. Brakes will make is safe if they are in good condition by NOT locking up when they shouldn't be locking up. If you have brakes that are working in perfect condition then they will do what they are designed to do. Stop the vehicle under normal conditions. If they are sticky, or grinding, or just not working. As far as driving on ice. If you don't need to stop then don't apply brakes. No matter what, Ice is not a good thing for any vehicle. Brakes will make driving on ice bad. Well only if you use them. Stay off the brakes, drive forward and don't turn the wheel. I hope this helps.|`|7DNHglk5aa	cargo-   http://omlogistics.in/
eL1kuDhbaa	If the car is old, you can make it look like new, if you follow some rules. 1. If painting outside, build yourself an outdoor paint booth. You can do this by using 8' 2x4's and foundation blocks,with heavy plastic. You take the wood, stand it vertically in the block holes, and you staple the plastic (visqueen)to the wood. This prevents draft, and overspray. Before that, sand car down, and skim coat any damages with patching body compound. Next use a thick primer with two parts paint, to one part thinner..Strain it good(get these from paint store)!You will need to use a compressor with a regulator and water seperator. The pressure will need to be adjusted to 32psi. Once you have that, you can purchase an inexpensive gun. Your car could be painted by Earl Scheib, or Maaco for the costs associated with doing yourself. If they are close! If you email. I will explain in detail how it can be done, the hill billy way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FjgLglhoaa	http://www.carcraft.com/howto/24820/inde...|`|ssYUtrQ1aa	You need a big working area, preferably indoors and absolutely dust free. A spray gun, lots of painter's tape (the blue kind), primer, paint, and clearcoat paint, Sand paper of different grit  s, body putty if you have bad dents and holes, and some safety stuff (mask gloves etc...). Typically after removing all body accents, you remove the paint with a grinder unless you want to work on it forever. Fill in any imperfections and sand over them with lighter grit. Tape up the things you don;t want to paint and use newspaper for big areas like wheelwells. Apply 3 coats of primer, sanding after each coat. You'll be fine with primer for a while if you keep it clean and don't create new dents and scratches. When you're ready to paint, get the gun out again and apply 3-4 coats of paint, sanding throughout. Don't forget to clean the gun every time you use it. When you're through, apply 4 clear coats. Make it 5 if you really want to. Take the tape off immediately so you don't end up chipping paint off. Attach a wire from your vehicle's body to a metal pole in the ground, this will prevent your vehicle from getting a static charge and attracting dust. When it's dry, give it a heavy coat of wax and watch that sucker shine.|`|BNlSh53faa	Wow you're not ready are you.

You want to drive with one person, who is 14, who is from your immediate family.    Therefore,   you are not driving with more than 3 people, so that doesn't apply to you.  The passenger is under 20, however, there is only 1 and he is a member of your immediate family.    So, yes, you can drive your one 14yo brother to school legally.|`|knbxWtzBaa	Well, according to what you stated about the laws in Oregon, I'm pretty sure you can, because he's your immediate family.

yBc0HJifaa	DO NOT let the vehicle run hot again. Stop driving it until properly repaired.  Always be careful of hot radiators. On vehicles with pressure caps the system works sort of like a pressure cooker. I am rusty on the exacts but for every pound of pressure a radiator is subjected to the boiling point of the liquid is raised something like 2 degrees. A 12 to 15 P.S.I. cap would raise the boiling point 24 to 30 degrees. This means the system could run from 236 degrees to 242 degrees.     I see this time and again.  I have had this or that done and still have a problem. Was the work performed at a repair shop? Has any testing been done? I am not sure who would have decided to replace the reservoir. This is a water overflow and recovery container. It is probably not under pressure and if not leaking why was it replaced?     This site tells those that answer questions to do research and be specific on answers. There needs to be a section that advises those seeking answers(posting questions) to be specific and give as much information as possible. The quality of answers would improve exponentially to the amount of information supplied.     Without some knowledge of the year, make, model, engine size, and other important information about the vehicle, as well as a history of the problem, it is hard to give more than a guess.    If a vehicle over heats there is a series of tests, depending on specifics of the vehicle, that should be followed. Below is a generic set of things to look for and will include several vehicles. For the above vehicle the thermostat needs to be replaced but test   2 should be performed first. These tests, and any order, may very according to information a technician has gained. Considering the water pump and radiator has been replaced(I assume all new) this will change things some. I also assume a new radiator came with a new cap.   I would also like to add that if the vehicle in question has bleeder screws on the thermostat neck or another location I would attempt to bleed the system first.  Some tests are in order of ease and safety.   1)- Visual: Verify that there is no leaks. This would include checking to make sure there was no traces of oil in the radiator, reservoir, or water in the oil. Check the passenger floorboard for signs of antifreeze. This would be to check for a leaking heater core. Check the fuses and relays. I will assume this vehicle is new enough to have electric fans.   2)- Check the engine codes. This may lead to a shortened test time if the temp sensor has set a code.   3)- Perform a radiator pressure test. Pump up the radiator to the pressure recommended by the factory. This will be the same as the required pressure cap and the system should be able to maintain this. I perform this with the engine very warm but not hot. A crack somewhere may only show up with a hotter engine as metal expands when hot. Since the radiator should be new this test will only help verify suspicion if it fails the pressure test. It could have a blown head gasket near a water port.    4)- Crank up the vehicle and let it run to operating temperature watching the gage. Also observe the exhaust for excessive liquid and an antifreeze smell.   If only one fan I would see if the fan operates when the A/C is switched on. This will verify that the fan moter and relay works.  If the vehicle has two fans one would be air assist for the A/C. I would turn on the A/C and see if the auxillery fan functions.    When the gage gets to operating temperature the fan should operate. If not, and the engine runs good, I would stop and test the fan, relay, temp sensor, and wiring. If equipped with bleeder screws I would attempt to bleed the system. If there is no air we can exclude air lock from the list. If these test good(probably not) I would  5)- Run a wet and dry compression test.  a)- pull all the plugs and inspect them. Also look for the smell of antifreeze. It is a distinct smell that some say appears to be sweet smelling.  b)- run a test on all the cylinders and record the results. If they are within specs good. If not I run a wet test and record and compare. I use a two piece compression tester and I can disconnect the end and attach an air hose.  c)- with each cylinder at TDC secure the crank and apply air pressure to each cylinder. I use two tools to assist with this. A mechanics stethoscope to listen for escaping air, and a cap with a pressure gage on it to see if air is escaping to the radiator. If I have not found a problem up to this point I will probably find a blown head gasket or a possible cracked head.   One of these test or combinations will discover the problem. They have never failed. A vehicle is designed to run at a specific temperature and will not run hot for no reason.   I would suggest another shop if you had one replace the parts you mentioned and still have a problem.   Sorry for the length but it might have been shorter with more information. Be sure to install a thermostat because it|`|UNUJNgHxaa	To answer this correctly I will need to get more information from you. First off have you checked to see if there is water in your oil? It will be a white milky look to it. IF there is no water in your oil and you are still loosing water, here is a quick and easy thing you can do. Take the vehicle to a radiator repair shop. Ask them to do a pressure test on the cooling system. They will do this for a minimal charge. Usually about 30 bucks. This test will tell were the leak is at. How bad the leak is, and let you know what parts to replace. It's a lot cheaper to do this then it is to keep replacing parts that may not need to be replaced. Plus the piece of mind of knowing what is wrong is worth the 30 bucks. I hope this helps and good luck to you.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	a clogged heater core. was the cooling system bled? it might need the air bled out of the cooling system for it to circulate.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Still many things left ;rad cap, water pump, blockage, timing,exhaust restriction, head gasket.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	a leak in the coolant system?|`|d0MIgl38aa	if you have an electric cooling fan it is probably not working correctly.  turn on your air conditioner with the car running and if the cooling fan does not turn on you have a problem.

Perhaps your gauge is faulty. Is the car running hot or is the gauge just showing the car is hot? Perhaps you should try another gauge on the car to make sure yours is reading correctly.    If the car is actually getting hot, it may be a serious problem. I would be having your system pressure tested. Its possible there may be a blown head gasket or a cracked head.

AA12193324	Yes it is totally possible.  It's a bad idea.  The factory turbo engines have a lot more than just a turbo added for a good reason.  The whole engine block is stronger, bigger injectors and fuel pump, and the ECU is programmed for turbo boost.  If you turbo a stock NA engine block you will eventually blow your head gasket if you don't crack the block or head itself!    The $2K cost estimate is probably low.  If you do it yourself you could maybe get it done that cheaply.  $4K - $8K is more like depending on how reliable you'd like it to be.  The old saying is "Fast, Cheap, Reliable -- pick two"  is very true.  You're best off buying a factory turbo and having a nice reliable setup that Subaru will cover under warranty if something were to go wrong.

This will get the full output of 1000wrms (500wrms per sub) that you want.     However if you could only wire them to achieve a 2ohm load to output 500wrms (250wrms per sub) then this will work to, it just wont be as loud. If we knew what type of voice coil setup you had we could help you out a bit more.    Good luck,    Ben|`|Hc0vjK5laa	Gloriously....

MvRP9bGzaa	sorry but the most reasonable way to fix the leak is to find out where it is leaking from and then check options for repair. kinda vague question|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it depends on where the leak is at. if it,s the valve pan or oil pan gaskets then you might be able to snug up the bolts a little.|`|ZdIaVkIcaa	Find out where it's leaking from and change that gasket/seal|`|KBVAbwUXaa	find out where the leak is coming from and... It.s probably a gasket. Replace it. Most common is head gasket or oil pan gasket. You should've mentioned the year and the application.|`|a8m3HdDHaa	Depends on where the leak is.|`|VuIxxJvqaa	Head Gaskets won't give you a oil leak. You will lose oil but it will be combusted, not leak.    You should thoroughly degrease your motor and gearbox so that it is as clean as you can possibly get it, then start it up and look to see where the leak is coming from.    It could be something simple like a fuel pump gasket, or possibly the oil filter is leaking, or something harder to fix like a pan gasket. It could also be a leak from your gearbox, What colour is the oil?     Gaskets aren't dear to buy, but replacing them could be time consuming and expensive. A pan gasket could take around 4 hours to replace.|`|ogDDDC85aa	bars leak works well|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	depends you didnt say from where so im guessing its valve cover  if thats the case go buy a new gasket set if its oil filter get a new oil flite and screw it on if its rear seal or front seal or oil pan have someone do it|`|ZS17qeVvaa	what ever you do don't use any think that say stop leak. those sh*ts plug up things that shouldn't be plugged. yes they might stop the leak but in the long run they cause more damage then good
Lsng62eLaa	Don't listen to those *** dumba$$es. The 300ex has a very reliable engine and no muffler won't do it any hard providing that you jet it right. And if you are just riding for a few days/weeks that is nothing to worry about at all.|`|AA10025824	You'll kill it, and probably get arrested.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Not past my house!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Worst case scenario, burned valves, ruined engine, big bucks to fix, hearing loss, neighbors calling the police on you, you can't ride in some areas.|`|JKQhSGEEaa	burned valves after time its not worth it.|`|u0PHhZOSaa	not worth it youll just **** it up for the rest of us. you know when you want to do something or go some where but cant cause 1 person ****** it up for all...this 1 person will be you =). not trying to be a dick but think.|`|ogDDDC85aa	no the valves will get burnt,it will still run but will gradually start too loose power because the valves are not sealing eny more.|`|xKuozocFaa	i do mine still runin like a champ|`|k9Uxo6lWaa	do everybody that rides off road a favor..... put a muffler on it. all you are gonna do is draw tons of negative attention to yourself and the sport... we have enough problems with peoplr trying to shut down off road riding with out you giving them another reason....|`|72688aae7e472777b624289e7b6159acaa	You also cant go with out the muffler because of the rules about spark arrestors - this is a FEDERAL LAW.  If you are caught - you'll be in trouble...  There are tons of rules on decible levels now too... If you are using trails, stay within the rules.....we dont want to loose them - we love the trails!

jieKgKF1aa	the wheel nut is stripped usually from tightening wheels with an air driven impact gun the only is to cut nut off and replace wheel stud if not sure take it in and have it done.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	the threads are stripped. put something behind the nut and turn it with a wrench. you might be able to catch some threads.|`|l1dAq3pOaa	You stripped either the nut or the bolt!  Go to hardware store and get a nut cracker to take the lug nut off.  If the nut was only stripped you are in luck as you only have to buy a new lug nut.  If the bolt is stripped you will have to take off either the drum or disc and pound out the bad bolt and put in a new one with a new nut.  Then you should be back in business.|`|c2E0GBqpaa	Sounds like you've stripped the lug, the post or both...my recommendation would be to carefully cut off the lug(sideways) so as to not damage the post...if the post is also stripped, you may have to replace the wheel...good luck.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	use a screwdriver and pry at it while your turning it might get it off so you can throw it away if not wil have to cut it with chisel or a torch|`|ktMefP0oaa	the bolt the lug nut tightens on has splines on the other end driven into the hub so it won't turn when you put the lug nut on, if it was overtightened the splines could have stripped (had to fix my buddies a couple days ago) he went to wal-mart to have tires mounted and they couldn't get the nut off, so he brought it to me, I took a drill and used a bit a couple sizes smaller than the stud and drilled into the center of the stud the length of the nut (takes a while) then took a rod and hammer and punched down on the nut which broke it off, then took the wheel off, any good parts stores carry the lug studs and just use a punch and drive the old one backwards out, and drive the new one in.|`|HpwyYmoIaa	its probably stripped, someone either put it on crooked or overtightened it and its not on a thread. youre going to have to cut it off and probably get a new stud to fix it
jieKgKF1aa	maybe it is a bomb|`|zOIgzIy4aa	that,s probably the lifters. if they are adjustable then you can take up the slack in the push rods.|`|ff3246ab4193235aa580f70384f57b09aa	What kind of tick is it and is it louder when driving? Most likely it is just a lifter ticking that happens it could be a bad knock sensor causing it too. just make sure it has enough oil in it and keep it changed like you are supposed to shouldn't be a problem|`|BNlSh53faa	If its a valve tick, don't worry about it.  If you are worried take it to a mechanic, a lot of times they can figure out whether its a valve tick or rod tick.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	the tick may be coming from a valve . this is not dangerous . it may need to have the valves adjusted.or at most have a lifter that is collapsed if the car has less power now than it did when you got it than i would think this   Have a mechanic to listen to it and determine if it is a valve tap, if so he can tell you about it a lot more
Tcp3vHMzaa	No as long as they are interior you can have any color, anywhere.|`|jFwuiRKxaa	not legal everywhere in side your car.|`|k9dF1IDSaa	Wrong. LED lights are illegal to have inside your car, in any state.     My guess as to why would be because people could confuse you for an undercover police officer, the lights are distracting and could cause an accident, etc.    IF you really really wanted to have some I would say keep it discreet and of course dont mess around and get pulled over, because that could be something they could add to your ticket.
bdBYVhzqaa	No it wouldn't matter because I went there and they didn't look at it at all. I guess it just depends on the person who you're working with.|`|r5K5KgLpaa	In Calif., no log is necessary or required.  It's an honor system.
