20090223074213AApD8Iy	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does he always wanna kiss me?	whenever i hang out with one of my guy friends (who is 39 btw), he always wants me to kiss him. however, he has told me that he is not interested in marriage, children, or even a relationship other than friendship. i've already made it clear that i don't wanna have sex with him, so why does he still try to kiss me. i'm almost 28 and am looking forward to marriage (with someone else), so naturally this all feels odd to me.

20090223075156AAWFBdJ	Family & Relationships;Family	My sister is cutting herself....?	She is 13. The good news is, she went to my mom and showed her her wrists, and told her that she wanted help and didn't want to have this problem. None of us knew about this until last night. We have had a very rough year (2008), my parents got divorced, my dad went psycho after wards (literally) and is now serving 2 years in jail, my mom has a new boyfriend -only about 6 months after her divorce, etc etc. We have all been ok...ok not really, but we're taking everything one day at a time.  Well my sister has a friend who she has become more and more involved with, and this girl has been a horrible influence. She has a lot of problems and has really sucked my sister into it all. Also, this friend cuts herself -her stomach, her legs, her wrists. My sister is a very compassionate and empathetic person. She just totally got sucked in. That is what led to her cutting herself. There is a lot to this story but I don't want to get yelled at for making this so long.       Anyways, my question is what in the world should I do? How can I help her, how should I act? At this point she doesn't even know that I know.       If you need anymore info just ask. Thanks everyone.
20090223074826AAN21eO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friend needs advice with her boyfriend(long story)?	After a bitter separation(3months after), my friend, found a slightly younger man to date.(4 yrs younger Shes 26 and he is 22)  She fell in love!  Soon after(about 1 month), she had to move to another city because she could not afford to live by herself.  She moved in with her parents.  They lived in another state.  My friend and her boyfriend had a long distance relationship for 4 months and then she moved him up where she was.  Her parents said he could not stay with them, so she moved in with me.  She found a job and was saving up for a car and for a down payment on an apartment.  She encouraged her man to get a job.  He found one but refused to keep it longer than a month due to the fact that it was a 30 min drive to and from.  He watched her 2 year old daughter while she was at work.  Fair enough.  She worked and he took care of the child.  Then she and I both started to notice he had a drinking problem.  As soon as he got up he had a beer.  He drank until he passed out.  Inturn, I had to take care of her daughter.  I told her what he was doing and she banned him from drinking when he had to babysit.  Then he started hanging out with some guys he met.  He was never home and they fought because my friend needed him to help her and he was out drinking.  And so on and so on.  MY friend just moved out and they nonstop fight.  She tried tokick him out but he threatened her and said if he cant have her he will make it so no one will and if he cant live in the house, he will make it so it is unlivable.  HELP  SHE IS SCARED AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

20090223075759AANk0t5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What makes a guy jealous?	I was going out with this guy for almost a year now..We were best friends in high school and we love each other..But for some odd reason, he doesnt wanna be with me anymore.  He's neber been with anyone else except for me..So he told me his reason is because he wants to experience relationships with other girls.  And also, he thinks I was too dependent on him..But anyways, I think he's just scared to be committed. But the thing is, hes such a sweet guy and I love him so much, I don't want to lose him but i don't want to let him feel free to come back to me whenever he wants because he will realize that we had something good and he will regret.  But what should I do to make him realize this? I don't want to run after him, just make him realize that he we were and still aer worth it!

I made a bet with my bestfriend, we are always making stupid bets, weve known eachother forever. i told her i could make my boyfriend a passable girl next halloween and nobody at the halloween party would know he was really a guy. nobody at all. she says there is no way a guy could pass as a girl. that they dont look enough or act enough like girls do. my boyfriend is pretty skinny and he's just an inch taller than me. he's 5'5.my boyfriend said he would go along with whatever. he's cool with it as long as he gets half the money. the best part is i have 9 months to prepare him for it. whats the best way to make him passable. what should he wear. how far should i take this. is it possible to hide his features enough. how do i get him to act more like a girl so nobody finds out. if one person realizes he is a guy , i lose the bet. let me know. thanks. if you have to put links down, that could help too. i dont know. ill take any advice i can get . should i let his hair grow out. shave legs, etc. do i teach him how to act like a girl? makeup? please be as specific as possible, i really want to win this bet. pictures would help to, and i promise to post pics after its all done. thanks so much.      ps.. i thought i would add to this question. nobody is giving me ideas on costumes he should wear. and should i actually get his hair styled as a girl. and i think i need to teach him how to act like a girl too. he is close to my size , im pretty sure he could fit into my clothes for practice. also feel free to email me or im me. i would appreciate it. thanks

20090223080541AAWFBqG	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What to give Bridal Shower host as a Thank You Gift?	My MOH is taking on the shower all by herself (1 BM will help but has very limited funds as she is on disability and the other 2 BMs - fiance's sisters - are so wrapped up in themselves that they don't want to pitch in).   I really want to do something special & extra-nice for her since I've told her I don't need a shower but she wants to have it anyway and is willing to pay for it all by herself.   I can probably spend up to $200 on it.  Would jewelry be good or too "same old thing" to give her?   Any other ideas?      I do want it to be *something* that she can keep rather than a spa day or salon thing which is done & over with.      Thanks for the ideas!!

20090223080533AAfXYEu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How would you react if your husband talked about his ex-wife like this in front of you (to his son)?	I have just met my husbands son (aged 25) for the first time, as he lives abroad and is visiting us on holiday.     While we were out with a group of friends he started talking to his son about his ex-wife (son's mother) saying he hoped the son realises why he divorced the mother, and said part of it was that she only wanted sex every few months and then it had to be quick, and that he hoped she has changed and that she finds someone else (they have been divorced 4 years) - we have been married two years.  The son told him it's his life and that he shouldnt look back.  (wise advise) Hubby said you need to look back to understand what went wrong.  It made me feel strange he was talking like this to his son with me within earshot.  I heard everything, but pretended I didnt. I am now uncomfortable that he is regretting leaving his ex and trying to get news about her from the son, seeing if she has changed, if she's seeing anyone, etc..... What do you think - how should I handle this?

Kids don't ruin it, but they don't make it any easier either.  I think he asks for oral sex way too much. Is it possible? I think it is, but my real question is... how should I bring it up to him?

It happened at uni and I have since moved away so the people Im surrounded by now didn't really know him, and cant help me sometimes.

20090223081827AAiuaGi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I build trust in a relationship that only has a little?	For the past few months I have been trying my hardest to rebuild trust with my boyfriend. There have been people in his past that have hurt him because he is a really sweet and sensitive guy. I have hurt him too by being controlling. He called off our wedding and engagement because of that. I think my controlling was the icing on the cake.       We are still together, but he constantly asks me if I want to break up with him after he overreacts to things. He always thinks I am manipulating him. He take things the wrong way; for instance, he thought I was manipulating him when he was nervous about having time to finish his school work and I replied "well we've got the whole day, so that's good". I was just trying to look on the brighter side of things. He gets angry very easily, especially when he's tired. He gives me the silent treatment when he's upset or he accuses me of becoming who I used to be. He can't deal with any problems I have because he's taken on so many of my problems in the past. Sometimes he gets very angry. Then other times he is okay.      I made a 100% turn around and he is very mean to me now, and the mistrust is hurting the both of us. Im going to keep trying. But what can I do to make him trust me? How can I get him to stop getting angry at me?

I confronted him about this and he started to tell me they were just friends but I just did not understand why finds were talking that much, meeting each other, and after I found out about her he got a prepaid phone so he could talk to her.  He keeps telling me they are just friends and I have heard different.  I don't know who to believe my husband or the rumors that are going around.  Everyone keeps telling me that I can do better than him and that he is a peice of crap for what he has done to me.

20090223080725AAzfLXB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Social activity needed for a returned solder?	Hey everyone. Need a bit of advice. Here's my situation: I was in the Army about 4 years, most of which was spent in Germany. Recently, I finished my obligation and moved back home. I am one of those people that tend to make few, but very loyal, friends wherever I go. Since I've lived all over the world, I have great friends scattered everywhere, but not back home.      I recently got engaged. I couldn't be happier - but I'm starting to notice that my relationship with my fiancee is basically all I'm subsisting on. We hang out all the time and she is my best friend. BUT, I feel myself getting very jealous when she's talking about guys (my age) that she works with (as a high school teacher). Seriously jealous. I let her know about it a few times, and it made me feel like a controlling ***.      I normally don't get jealous, I have no reason to distrust her, and I've been trying to figure out why the heck this is happening to me. I came to a conclusion - I need guy friends to hang out with again. Dudes. I need something more to my social life than just my relationship with my fiancee - because it has taken over my life and it isn't healthy.      The social aspect in the office where I work is awful - I'm surrounded by middle-aged women complaining about their husbands and mortgage payments. Shudder. My fiancee keeps gushing about how many awesome younger people she's friends with at her job, and I can't stand it. I need to do something. I feel like I'm stuck in the "Office Space" movie.      So what do I do? I work all the time, typical 8-5 job. All my old friends are scattered. It's too cold to join a coed softball league. I miss chilling out with "the guys," sitting around laughing, and playing street fighter 2 while duct taping beer bottles to our hands (edward 40-hands! :D)      Playing paintball every weekend is expensive, I'm getting sick of the bar scene AND the club scene. What the hell? Am I stuck in this horrible lifestyle for good? I need some ideas, because holy crap, man.
20090223081115AANZHiD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I expecting too much from my husband?	Let me start by saying that my husband and I are so much in love, and have been married for almost 6 years. We have two daughters one 4years  and one 7 months. My frustration is that I feel almost like I am taking on the role of Mother instead of wife. I work from home as a daycare provider, and care for our kids during the day, and I take care of all of the household stuff. Very rarely he might help out around the house, only if I have asked repeatedly. My husband won't even take a shower unless I tell him it's been a while since the last one. (note: he has no sense of smell due to a medical condition) He is a great dad when it comes to the girls, he does help with the baby when he gets home from work, granted it's only so that I can make dinner, but it's help. I feel like everything is always my responibility. I have to get the kids bathed, I have to put them to bed. After the kids are down for the night I have to clean up, and then he leaves his stuff all over and I just have to clean up again in the morning. Should I be expecting anything more, or is this the norm for husbands. Also we both have bad colds right now, and the baby has kept me up all week so I am exhausted. But I still have to tend to the kids and house, my husband feels like because he is sick he gets to do even less. Now I am expected to care for him and everything else. I guess I'm not allowed to be sick... Am I expecting too much?
20090223081858AAfSc3F	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband hygiene problems I need advice...?	My husband of 6 years does not shower regularly, and it drives me crazy. Sometimes he will only shower once a week! He has no sense of smell and can't tell how badly he smells sometimes. I have asked him repeatedly to shower more, but he never seems to change his habits. It is to the point where I have told him we can only have sex if he showers... I think that's the only he reason he ever actually showers lol. I love him dearly, but his hygiene is gross and despite my attempts he won't change. I must add, he had to have surgery to remove a boil due to his hygiene... what can I do to motivate him... sex only motivates him at that moment and I'd like a more long term solution.
20090223081326AAgOqkW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've known him my whole life. Could he be the one for me?	I've known this guy almost since I was born, our families are really close and we've always gone to school together. I know it sounds silly but I've always liked him and it wouldn't be exaggeration to say that I could love him. We have a pretty long and complicated romantic history but we've never actually been together officially. I know I'm probably too young to be thinking about this type of thing but seeing as how my entire 20 years of life I have had this feeling that we'd end up together I just wonder if maybe he's the guy for me.

20090223081430AADzbJz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm seeing this girl but theres a problem i am having?	okay so i have known this girl for about 4 years we are great friends but over the past month or so we have become very close if you know what i mean, so i slept over at her house and we had sex just like that for the first time, she said a week before we did it she wants us to become fcuk buddies so i thought yeah okay even tho i love her more than that, i mean shes alot smaller than me like 5ft and shes sort of fat but i look past that i see her real beauty and thats what i like about her also just beeing with her in general.so should i tell her how i feel, that i would like us to be more of fcuk buddies and make it more official. so basicly i would like us to do more of the fun stuff like kissing and what not and just to be with her more, so i guess i should say to her i want to be more than fcuk buddies and why not go out we have known each other for long enough. any thoughts guys?

Should I worry? It made me upset to know that he still thinks that she is pretty and cute, especially after all that she has done to him in the past. I know that he doesn't look at her in that way, but still... why does he still think she's pretty and cute? I always thought she was kinda funny looking...
20090223084501AA7pSDq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has your husband/bf ever done something dumb like this?	My husband put a frozen potato croquette in the microwave the other night for a snack. Apparently he put it in for too long and it exploded and the plate cracked in three pieces. Now the microwave smells smoky.      The instructions on the box clearly said "do not recommend microwaving this product" but he said the lettering was too small to see. *sigh* You'd think they would put things like this in large lettering for husbands.      Anyone have a similar funny story?      PS - To be fair, I did put two pizza slices in the oven a week ago to re-heat and forgot about them for five days. Yuck. I know, we're a pair.

20090223084440AAh6cBC	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help what should i do?	sorry this is sooo long but please help me, ill give the person with the best answer 50pts(if you want to know how just ask, but i wont answer unless you give me a good answer)      ok, ill try and cut this down so you wont get bored reading it. basically i think im in love with one of my best Friends, we've been close pretty constantly for about two years and I've always had really strong feelings for her. we've never done anything together in that way but last summer she told me that she was thinking about braking up with her currant boyfriend (of about 3yrs on and off) because she had feelings for someone else. after a few days of nagging her she told her it was me, i told her how i felt and we texted pretty much solidly for the next like 3 weeks, then we didn't speak for a few weeks. i found out during school after the summer that during those few Weeks she had dumped her boyfriend, got with her ex and two other lads. after this i was really depressed for about a month and was getting even more depressed because our friendship was dying and she didn't even seem to care. anyway, i tried really hard to become her friend again (successfully) and have been seeping in and out of depression ever since. the problem is i think about her all the time and i cant get over her while we are Friends and spend so much time together but the more time i spend with her the more depressed i get and if i spend like a day without her really talking to me i get even more depressed.  other really stupid little things like her not saying hello or giving me a hug when we see each other in the morning get to me loads more than they should. and i have a horrible feeling that im the jealous type, i hate myself for feeling it but when i see her like texting other lads or having fun with other guys i get depressed, and when im depressed she just ignores me completely and doesn't even talk to me which doesn't help. oh my god i sound so pathetic and stupid. i could go on all day about how she makes me feel, literally, so ill stop now and hope you haven't all got bored half way through. so what should i do? I've thought about going to the doctor for some pills. the only things ive found take my mind off her are exercise and alcohol. and im afraid that if i tell her our friendship will all go **** up because i get the stupid feeling that she doesn't really care about me that much and she doesn't ever seem to try and be my Friend, if that makes sense, just takes me for granted.    this whole thing probably doesn't make very much sense grammatically but hopefully you get the picture.   please help me.

I really am not a friend of them, but they're forcing me to talk to them and i really don't hang out with them and don't really like them. So when they talk i talk when i don't they just glare at me. So this time i blew it off and i screamed and shouted at one of them, she just remained to herself didn't reply. Later on, she sits and speaks badly about me to her friends, whom one of them also gives hints and insults me indirectly for not talking to them. They shut up as soon as i go in to a classroom. Why are they doing that ?

20090223084247AAyoatP	Family & Relationships;Friends	The GUY I'm IN LOVE with is LEAVING the country...How do I cope? I won't even get to say GOODBYE! :(?	He used to go to my school 3 years ago...I'm now 20 years old, and back in October he got in touch with me online...We chatted a lot on MSN and I really warmed up to him...Then we started meeting up for quick chats at nighttime...Eventually we started going places together and even met each other's families...      We kissed and hugged a lot and he made me feel safe and happy for the first time in ages!!!      But after only four weeks his life began to get busier and he started having less and less time for me...I suppose because of this I lost myself and became a bit clingy and demanding...I regret that now :(      Well, one day he texted me to tell me he needed space while he sorted his life out...He said we would still be friends and that he wasn't leaving me forever!      But then I heard that he had gotten back with one of his exes!!! In a moment of anger I deleted him from Facebook and we haven't spoken in six weeks.      It is his birthday today...I sent him a message wishing him a happy one...He hasn't replied and I'm upset because he is leaving the country next week for 8 months!!! I'm scared I won't even get to say goodbye or give him a hug :(      He's going out with a bunch of friends this weekend...I'm so upset that I won't be going with him as he hasn't invited me :(      What do I do?

20090223085408AA8eqRS	Family & Relationships;Family	RE: Need Advice on Step Parenting?	I really need some advice please. I have been married for 4 years. This is my second marriage. I have been a step parent and it is one of the hardest things I have had to do. I have two children from a previous marriage and I know that something I can just chalk up to they are teenagers and are going to try to push the envelope. What would you recommend in this case? I have been house sitting for my boss and his wife. I have been working for them for over 8 years and just love him and his family. They are so good to me. They asked me to housesit for a week and I gladly excepted because they have wonderful dogs and I feel like they do so many nice things for me, it's the least that I could do, plus they pay me. :0) I can honestly say that I have never in all the times that I have house sat EVER gone through their personal belongings. I just think it's wrong. Plus I like that they trust me so much. Anyways, I brought my stepdaughter and husband over to the house. My boys were visiting their dad. She rummaged through my bosses wifes drawer and put on her bathing suit and took photos of herself on my space and I found them on the computer. This has not been the first time that I found her on my bosses computer as well as she has taken my things in the past. I feel like my stuff is one thing, but to rummage through my bosses is another. What are your thoughts?      I believe in giving second chances so that is why I let her go again. I should have mentioned that I did ask her to respect their property and not go on the computer or go into any drawers or personal property before we got to the house.

I don't look 34, I look alot younger. Question...it can't be wrong. He already told his mom about me. It feels soo right. I haven't been happy like this in a long time. He feels the same. We just both didn't expect it to go so well. And believe me, I've been on a few dates in the recent months....this was soooo different. OPINIONS? I already know that it's just a number. And if you were to see us in a picture, you would not believe I'm a year shy from being twice his age..thanks everyone. Not only that, we DO have alot in common. We both skateboard, love music, play instruments and love tattoos. We haven't even had sex yet but yes we've fooled around so it's not all about sex with him. I would only encourage  him to have his own identity ofcourse!!!. He is older than his age, has been homeless and was forced to grow up quick I guess, doesn't seem 18 at all mentally. I am not 34 at all physically or mentally.lol...SO WHAT YA GUYS THINK? Chemistry is great!!! Never thought this would happen to me. I also don't have to tell him to do things, he does em on his own...like he took out the trash...without saying anything...

A week later we met for a platonic date and after talking with him I strongly felt he was the one, but a day later I found out the guy I am seeing now got me pregnant. So HE asked me to marry him and I said yes. Again, I cut off communication with my ex until now (3 mos later) when I had the miscarriage. I told my ex I had the miscarriage, but would still marry my current boyfriend anyways-we've been living together for 5 months and dating for 6. I plan to marry him in April and hopefully be pregnant again, by then. Thoughts? I think it may have never worked with my ex and my fiance is 34, I am 25 and my ex was only 22. My fiance is much more stable and I know he'll never leave me.

20090223084157AAVFP7Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it really too much to ask?	My boyfriend and I are having a huge argument and I'm afraid it's going to affect us badly. Friday night he went to his Mom's birthday party. He works 10AM to 10PM so i hardly get to ever talk to him. He calls me before and gets off the phone quick and I didn't talk to him the day before so I ask him to call me later so we can actually talk. The party was at a bar but he's not 21 so obviously he's not legally allowed to drink. 1 AM rolls around and no call or text or anything from him so i call him and no answer. He calls me around 1:30 saying he walked in and people started feeding him beers left and right. I get upset with him. We get into a huge argument the next day because I say "why couldn't you have just texted me or something saying you were going to be out late drinking"? and of course his response is sorry i was having a good time with my family and i wasn't thinking about texting you. is that too much to ask? i mean i asked him to talk to me one night and he calls me around 1:30 AM drunk. I'm not asking for him to apologize for having a good time with his family and drinking but why can't he just understand why i was upset? I was upset because i haven't talked to him for a couple days and he calls me late, drunk. how am i supposed to have a real conversation with him? why can't he just understand that? we have argued and argued and all he keeps saying is "i don't care to understand". What do i do? how do i go about handling this? do i keep trying to talk to him?
20090223084556AAa4ivp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm not sure what to do about our issue ?!!?	Ok I've been with my bf for a year now. I know in my heart that he is the one and only. He feels the same way.We talk of getting married all the time and soon.   He wants to move into together so that we are never apart. I want that to. But I don't think its right to live together before you get married. I tried to talk to him about it but he got so upset.I don't want to loose him. But I also don't know what to do. I know my fam will have a cow over us "living in sin". I love him so very much and Im scared he will leave because of this.   I do want to live with him but not sure if i can hide it from most my fam and church. Anyone have any advice or ever been in my shoes ??
20090223084648AAxIzSq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Another "does she like me?" thread...?	Okay, this might get quite long, so if you don't want to spend a few minutes reading, just turn back now.      There's this girl that I met a few years ago on a camp - we quickly formed a little group, and every time we're at the camp (two times a year) we hang out together and such. Now, last december, I got news that a new girl was coming to my class - to my surprise, it was her. As I already knew her, I took upon the task to get her "safely" into the school/class, answer all questions she might have and such.   Now, the past two weeks (around 6 weeks after she started in school) shes been starting to "grow" on me. I'm not a houndred percent sure, but I think she likes me too - according to my friends, she seems to flirt a awfull lot with me. She always wants to sit beside me, she always wants to hug me, if we are watching a movie (we are a group of 4-5 persons that hangs out alot, I quickly got her "adopted" into that group) for example she wants to sit beside me, and likes to lay her head on my chest, etc... She doesn't do it to anyone else, but that might just be because she's known me for the longest and is more comfortable with me, although she seemed to fit in quite fast without problems.   The thing is, I've never actually really been that much into relationships, flirting, etc, so I don't really know how to read the signs - I'm not sure if she's just being friendly, or if she's "into" me.      All answers are appreciated, and if you have a problem with me asking here, then don't even bother posting.
20090223084820AAFSDPI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you ever trust someone after they break it?	I know this question has probably been asked a million times on here, but I'd just like a more personal response. I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years because he had lied to me more than once. Trust was never an issue in our relationship until he started college. He wanted his freedom. I haven't seen him in over a year, but still hear from him from time to time. I have dated other people, but cannot get over him. I think about him everyday. It's not fair to anyone I meet. My ex says he feels the same way. I miss him terribly and I am not mad at him anymore, but does anyone honestly think I can ever trust him again??
20090223084857AA2UBb7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What to do when the person you love doesn't love you back anymore?	This might be a little lengthy but is necessary to get both perspectives out there.      I was dating this girl back in college and we were so crazy about each other! We were inseparable, the of best of friends. I was completely convinced that she was the one I was going to marry, I loved her almost unconditionally.      When she graduated I had one year remaining. She moved back home and I knew our relationship would be strained because of the distance. We started drifting apart but I continued to give more and more hoping that it would make a difference. I lost who I was as an individual and she starting dating one of her ex-bf's again. Needless to say I was devastated, as time progressed my sorrow turned into rage. I erased any memory or thought i had of her but never really had closure.      One and a half years later are paths remarkably cross again. One moment on the moon lit beach and we were in love again. Things kicked off great it was like a fairy tale. However I didn't realize all the built up resentment that still remained. Little by little it started to come out, and i would do and say mean things to her. Not intentionally I would never want to hurt her on purpose.      It's been a long process but I finally learned to forgive. I don't have that anger in me like before. But I feel its too late. Now she can barely stand the sight of me. She pulls away when I reach for her. I know I screwed up in the past but these last 2 months i have given everything that is left of me. Bottom line is I love her and I want her to be happy even if that means without me...
20090223085013AAN5jye	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What happens when a pre-op transman marries?	Hi, I'm asking this question for a friend of mine.      He is a pre-op Female-to-Male transsexual. He won't be medically transitioning for years yet but is engaged to his (biologically) male partner.       He is considering getting married to his fiance (so transman is still legally female and would be marrying his male partner) and then later on splitting and getting a civil partnership when he has his Gender Recognition Certificate.       His title is legally male, so would marriage change this and make it Mrs? Or could he still keep the title of Mr despite them being legally married as man and wife?

20090223091746AAWSM8T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Some personal sex questions for those who are  in a long term relationship.?	I'm just curious;      -How long you've been in your relationship?    -How old either of you are?    -How often you have sex?    -If you have kids, how much has it affected how often you have sex?   -Do you wish you could have sex more? Or are you happy as it is?      Not that sex is that important, I just am really wondering how it will be and if it may change over time. I'm 23 my fiance is 43. We've only been together since September 16th 2008, living together since maybe 2 weeks after that. After I moved in I found out I'm pregnant with his baby, and we're both thrilled. I'm mostly curious about this because I've been in a 5 year live in relationship before. With my X, after the first 3 years our sex life pretty much stopped completely, we just lost interest in each other sexually, but we loved being around each other still, had no kids. I'dve maried him even knowing we'd never have sex ever again, but like I said, I do enjoy it. Is that what it's like in most relationships? I've not been in this new relationship long I know, but we are both really into each other and he's shown me how much he Truly cares and loves me. And I know I love him too. I know we'll be happy, and I don't need sex to be happy, but again, I do very much enjoy the sex. This being a new relationship, I'm wondering if having a baby will really impact our desire to have sex? Or will we just be that tired to not even bother?   As it is, for the first 3 months we had sex every day once a day and maybe once a week it was twice a day. Now it's never twice a day and maybe 4-5 times a week. If I had it my way we'd have sex 3-4 times every day at least. Is this a problem? I've talked to him about it and he's just not capable of doing it more then once a day, maybe the "newness" of it all was all the difference before, which I'm OK with. I'm not mad or angry, I'm just curious since this is the man I will be with the rest of my life. I just want to hear other peoples situations and get a gist of what life will be like in the future. If you have any other personal questions about this you'd like me to answer ask and I'll update this post with the answer. Thank you.
20090223094810AA6IzPp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just keep playing it cool?	I've been seeing someone for a little over a month now. Things are going fine, but we have not had any kind of talk about what we're doing, whether or not we're exclusive, and certainly have not put a title on our relationship. I'm not complaining, but I do like him enough that I would want to be a little bit more committed, such as being his girlfriend.      We're in our 20s, but he is 6 years older. I think that he may be worried that since I'm younger, I don't want anything serious. But, he has not given me any hint that he wants something serious, either. Should I just keep playing it cool like I currently am? Or should I ask about what we "are?" How can I do that without sounding immature?

He said he needed a weeks space, and that he would ring me monday (tonight)      over this last week i've gone from being absoloutly devastated and not sure if he was just letting me down gently - out of nearly two years together, for the last month he's just not really here.      now i've started to feel a lot better - mentally, i don't know if i've started to get over him? or whether i'm feeling alright because i've convinced myself we're going to be fine.      when he does phone tonight i've no idea what to say/ how to be, i feel really confused?      has anyone else been through anything similar? or what do you think i should do? i.e .. do i just let this past week wash over me despite how awful i felt, or do i suggest we talk about stuff?

20090223092248AAUTRMK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think is going on?	My husband recently told me that he wants a divorce, but he still wants to remain friends.  He actually wants to start our relationship all over again and see if we marry again.  His explanation is that the foundation of our marriage is so damaged that we have to tear it down and start all over again so that we have a strong marriage if we get remarried.  We have to have an 18 month separation and we may take a longer one if need be.  He says he cares about me a lot and is doing this because he doesn't want to hurt me.  He also says that if we end up married he wants to know it was for the right reasons.  Many people who know him say that they believe during the separation he will decided that he wants to work things out and come home without a divorce.  What do you think is going on?  I know for a fact that he is not involved with anyone else because we are always together.  Please no rude comments...I am just trying to figure things out and find a way to restore my marriage with the least amount of pain.
20090223094723AAoKG2L	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a friend who gossips way too much?	The majority of our conversations are about other people. I don't usually add to the conversation, I just sit there silent..I was hoping that would give her the hint to stop...but it didn't.         It just really hit me hard yesterday when she started a story with "She told me not to tell anyone but..." then proceeded to tell me something really personal about one of our friends.         She's my best friend and I've told her many personal things that she's promised not to tell anyone.      I've gotten over that many people probably know those things now, and I don't plan on telling her anything else personal.      But how do I get her to stop gossiping? If other people knew they'd be so mad.
20090223095150AAlqL07	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women complain about double standards?	Some reason i hear a lot of women complaining about this double standard for women being called sluts and whores and that's it not fair that guys get a pat on the back for the same reactions. Last time i checked its not that guys who go around spreading the rumors. i don't remember having one conversation with a guy about sex with another woman. not this year at least. Maybe somebody can give me an insight on what im missing. Im keeping an open mind about this even though i already have an opinion
20090223095536AAHQ63m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he just want me for sex or not?	I know this guy (he is 22) hrough a friend and we all partied together a couple of times. The first time, we didnt really talk much and I was into his friend and we ended up kissing. He wanted to have sex (and is a major player) but we didnt do anything and I think I will leave it at that. I started flirting with the other guy and I found out he though I was "sexy". Apparently my friend told him that I was into him and he said that he got excited and said he should do something about that. The next time we partied together, he started talking to me more and kept putting his arm around me the whole night. HOWEVER, I saw him kissing one of his friends who was really drunk but I dont think they did anything else. I asked him what he was looking for and he said he is keeping his eyes open for the right person. I said I was too and we had this "moment" when he said "you just never know..." and looked deep into my eyes. I ended up falling asleep in his lap while he was watching a movie and he kept stroking my hair. He then went to sleep and covered me with a blanket. I havent talked to him since and I want to know if he likes me or if he is just trying to get into my pants, like his friend. But Im a little unsure because he didnt even ask for my number or give me his. Does he truly like me?

20090223091640AAWj7K1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does it sound like he is over me but just afraid to hurt me?	I have a very complicated relationship w/a guy for over a year now. I can't commit fully and he has issues of his own. He called me last night and we talked for over 3 hours. At one point in the conversation he said "I love you, have I told you lately that I love you" after that he mentioned how lately he knows when he texts me or responds to my text that he is cold and that he could take the extra few seconds to add something sweet.       That my messages touch his heart and motivate his day and he feels like he could just grab me after he reads my message and kiss and hug me and be with me….but he said it makes him feel bad that he doesn't return with the same kindness but that he is holding back so he doesn't confuse me or himself further. Than he asked "should I say those things to you I mean for some reason it makes me feel uncomfortable I do feel those nice sweet things but now for some reason feel uncomfortable to say them...do you think I should say them?"       I told him that he should do whatever makes him feel comfortable. I am so confused as to what he meant and why he would say this. I tried to ask but he didn't really want to get into it further and said "well don’t you understand what I am trying to say?"....what do you make of what he said to me what is trying to say…does it sound like he does love me but is confused over our situation or he is over us but afraid to hurt me?

20090223094125AAQ97kV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why you should not be a virgin when you marry........?	Why are some people so determined to remain a virgin before they marry? Haven't they ever heard the phrase "You don't buy the car before you take it for a test drive."?? I have never slept around, and have been in a few serious relationship. If I was ever in a relationship that I could see going somewhere, eventually we would be sleeping together. Remember virigins - once you marry that person, they are expected to be your only sexual companion for life. And if you're not sexually compatible, then one or both of you may end up incredibly disappointed, and chances are it will end in disaster. Can anyone see my point?

20090223090406AACRN1A	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Jealous of my fiance, my wedding is making me feel so isolated?	Im sort of bummed because Im planning my wedding and I have no female friends.   Since I moved out to the new state I reside in almost 4 years ago I have only made close friendships with male gendered people, odd because I am a very petite girly girl.   The only females invited to my wedding are family, my bridesmaids are my sister (who lives hundreds of miles away) and my fiance's cousin (my only  true female friend  I have)      So basically I have no one to throw me a bachlorette party, and no one to attend even if I did.   Im really bummed out about it.   All my  bests, and other friends are going to be taking my fiance out for his bachelors party and I feel so left out that I won't be invited!   I was told they are having a guys poker game, drinking a bit and heading out to the strip club....things I do with them.            I feel like a jealous little child and I don't want him to have a party if I cant.  I KNOW its immature, I KNOW its rediculouse  but I really can't help but feel completely upset by this.....and also realizing the fact that I have no female companions (something that never bothered me until I started planning this wedding)      What do I do to make myself feel better about this.  Planning my wedding is only seeming to make me feel very isolated.  I have no family besides my sister, I have no female friends, my only friends are mutual friends of both mine and my fiances  but 90% of them knew him first and better.  I can't invite co workers because I work alone all day.  So I feel no one is comming to the wedding to see and support me.   Im at the point where I want to cancel everything and cry.
20090223085811AADB11P	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I am working in this new company, the guys that are working with me are younger, i am 29 and they are 24-27?	but they love making fun of each other and putting everyone down, I tried to socialize with them but i was rejected coz i was formal, then i started to make fun of some of them and expect a similar reply as a way to break the ice between me and them but i think i made a mistake, i can't control their behavior now, they put me down all the time and i feel i cant compete with them! Now I feel weak and pissed off and i feel that they disrespect me although i am older than them , i don't know how to act with their childish behavior anymore , what do you suggest?
20090223085934AAC9KkB	Family & Relationships;Family	How do we ask my fiance's sister and her daughter to leave our house?	They both live with us for nothing, they only live with us because they have 'no where' to live (they can afford a flat but claim they can't)    Her daughter - she's ten - goes through everything, she breaks everything (she piled cups and plates up and it over balanced breaking all our cups and plates) she goes through all my stuff and uses the little makeup I have.   Her mum doesn't discipline her. She never turns up to work and has recently been fired again. She sits all day in front of the TV eating all the food. She complains when me and my fiance get up and move around in the morning because she's trying to sleep on the sofa even though she and her daughter have our two spare rooms - one of which is meant to be for our baby. I've been told I'm only being like this because I'm pregnant (I'm only 9 weeks but I've been living with them for just over a month and it's doing my head in.)       Between me and my fiance we are just making ends meet. If she doesn't start helping soon I'm going to loose my job because I can't afford the rent on my building for my studio and to pay my way in bills and food.    I don't want them here when the baby comes because the are both so irresponsible and I wouldn't want them around my baby. His sister keeps trying to get me to give her daughter free dance lessons because she's over weight which she blames me for because I cook dinner and make her daughter's school lunches. Her daughter doesn't eat the lunches I make. She says she wants salads which I make but them she throws them away and uses the money she gets off her mum to buy chocolate and sweets on her way to school as the school is just down the road.

Because I had asked him like 5 times to help me with the laundry and everytime he said later he would do but he never did so I had to do it myself .. ALL of it. Then last night I wanted for us to watch a show together, the late night show and asked if I could lean on his shoulder and for some reason he was all moody and mean, he came home from work and was like NO so I ignored him pretty much all last night until he apologized an hour later but I'm still mad. why can't we get along? we've been dating a year. still young.

Is she entitled to have anything by law? This is in New York State. Thanks

Went soooo well. We both couldn't/can't believe how well we just get along and how much we have in common. Yes he's 18 and I'm 34. He has been through alot and does not act like he's 18. I don't look 34, I look alot younger. Question...it can't be wrong. He already told his mom about me. It feels soo right. I haven't been happy like this in a long time. He feels the same. We just both didn't expect it to go so well. And believe me, I've been on a few dates in the recent months....this was soooo different. OPINIONS? I already know that it's just a number. And if you were to see us in a picture, you would not believe I'm a year shy from being twice his age..thanks everyone. Not only that, we DO have alot in common. We both skateboard, love music, play instruments and love tattoos. We haven't even had sex yet but yes we've fooled around so it's not all about sex with him. I would only encourage him to have his own identity ofcourse!!!. He is older than his age, has been homeless and was forced to grow up quick I guess, doesn't seem 18 at all mentally. I am not 34 at all physically or mentally.lol...SO WHAT YA GUYS THINK? Chemistry is great!!! Never thought this would happen to me. I also don't have to tell him to do things, he does em on his own...like he took out the trash...without saying anything...   1 hour ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   Someone commented about KIDS AND BIOLOGICAL CLOCK...I have a 3 year old daughter and they get along great!! We've talked about that and he's afraid to bring a kid into this world...THIS WORLD I can only say that. He said it wasn't an issue at all....
20090223085650AAEc40y	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do older women lose their interest in romance?	I know that most women's libido declines with age, but what about their interest in romance?  When a 40-something woman acts like a cougar and shows interest in a man, is she interested in romance and a real relationship with him, or is she just having a midlife resurgence in her sex interest?

20090223091641AAPXmUs	Family & Relationships;Friends	My 13 year old best friend had sex with "some guy she met at the hotel"?	My friend has always been kind of a ****. And I mean she told me that it was "no big deal" (it was her first time too), and then decided that she no longer liked the guy she did so she dumped him and made out with some other guy. I don't know what to say to her to convince her that what she did was not only MORE than "no big deal" but wrong. And its weird because literally 2 weeks ago we were watching disney movies on youtube. I don't know what happened to my friend, and I'm used to just being annoyed for flirting with guys who are wayyy older than her but her "just doing some guy on a golf course" was going too far. What are other peoples' thoughts on this?

Me n Becky were like whatever! But then the girl actually picked me up off the floor and then she dropped me even though shes like a lot smaller n younger than me :\ It didn't hurt me at all but it left me hella confused! Then she said "i'll see you tomorrow' and laughed with her big group of friends as they walked off... is this going to happen often now? Shall i avoid the park?

However, It has been a month and she still has not sent them. I have asked her multiple times and the same result. Nothing. What does this mean? Is it a good thing or bad thing?

20090223090007AAjcJ0V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't she get off my back ?	Here's a little info...      So after having been chucked by my girlfriend Sarah, I moved in with a girl - we had to pretend we were a couple in order to get the flat - named Daisy. Six months later, Sarah, who had been betraying me with Duane who I thought was my friend, and me were talking in a diner, and she said she split up with Duane.      Anyway, we agreed to meet back later this week. Happy as I was, I told Daisy I thought Sarah wanted me to move back in with her, and that we were to sort out the details later this week. I thought she'd be happy, but she was a little bit angry at me, because she said that if I was too stupid to see the mistake I was going to make, someone, a friend, she, had to point it out to me.      In any case, we had a little row and we called each other names, and I told her that I was stupid enough and big enough to make my own mistakes. She said that Sarah obviously did, and that she won't wish me luck on something that could be bad for me.      I don't understand her, I thought she'd be glad for me, and now she's constantly on my back. What the hell is going on ?

He told me that he had a 3 month old little girl on the side.  During the time he had sex with this girl we weren't together but we moved in with each other a month after that.  I think what hurts so bad is this is the girl that has tried to ruin our relationship in the past.  He told me that he needed some space so that he would have time to think because i to have a 3 yr old by him. It's like my relationship and my future is ruined and he is the one I want to be with.  He wants and loves me as well but I don't believe that I can trust her.   He said that she is a girl that he doesn't want anything to do with.  He does have alot on his plate to think about because he is job less and now he has 3 kids to take care of.  He wants me to wait on him i told him that i would but it wont be forever.  We've been together for 5 yrs now and i donn't wanna lose him because of this. Plz give me some good advice because I feel like crap knowing that he might not be in my life any longer.

20090223092150AArJwuM	Family & Relationships;Family	I have a situation with two kids and hope you can help me.?	I have a situation with two kids and hope you can help me.      First some background info:      The twins (one boy, and one girl) have one parent in Texas and one in Illinois, and currently live in Illinois.      They were adopted at as toddlers and are now 18 years old.      They came home one day and the locks had been changed. Now they're homeless and staying with me and my kids.      I don't really know where to start, but I thought there are rules about what you can and can't do with your kids.      For instance:      1. Don't you have to give legal notice and 30 days       before you can kick a kid out?      2. Shouldn't the parents have to support the kids until they're 21?      The boy is still in high school until summer! Aren't parents obligated to help their kids until they turn 23?      I know my Dad had to support my other siblings until they graduated from college. Why aren't these kids getting       financial support? The boy has a job (Min. Wage), the girl doesn't.      3. The mother is withholding the girl's transcripts from her school in Texas (she won't fill out the right paperwork).       So the girl is 18 and has no high school, and can't get into school in Illinois without her transcripts.      What can I do? How can I help them? What are their rights?
20090223092205AAQcNVk	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please help me... I don't know how to leave my relationship. I ran away from home when i was 16, and started..?	staying with "mike" (26). We've been living together for the past four years. I'm 20 years old now. I have no furniture to my name, I'm not in school, and my self-esteem is so low it's hard to get out of bed in the morning. "Mike" loves to blame our problems on my maturity level, when in reality, he is controlling, verbally abusive, and tends to isolate me from the world. I know I sound like I'm playing the victim game, but I really don't feel I have the strength to do what I know needs to be done. I still feel love for him.. I kinda feel sorry for him, as funny as it sounds. It's been a downhill battle for the past few years. I have a dog, no friends, nowhere to go.. a job, but no money (no paycheck for two weeks). Please help me.. I've been rationalizing everything Mike is doing and even blaming myself. I need some outside perspective. WTF do I do? I'm so scared.
20090223093923AAFVAnW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is he cheating on me?	a few weeks ago when my bf was drunk he told me i smelled like one of his 16 year old cashiers at work (he claims to not remember this). i see texts from an unnamed number in his phone.. could tell it was from a female. nothing bad. obviously someone who worked with him.. asking about shifts. then she said something about her myspace.. but didn't tell what her myspace was called, so i know he's seen it before. I ask him about this, and he tells me he doesn't know whose number it is. I prove to him he's lying.. he knows he's lying. Then he says, I just didn't tell you because I knew you'd act crazy (I am kind of jealous.. but is this just an excuse??) Later-- leaves his phone at the house and she sends another text saying "yeah i'll hang out saturday if you find something fun to do". I flip out and call the girl and she tells me they've never touched but he makes her feel like he's coming onto her. I ask him about this, and he tells me "yeah he flirts with his cashiers.. no big deal" (he is kinda flirty.. needs other peoples affirmations to feel good about himself). I know he is flirty, and she might have misconstrued his feelings toward her. Either way it is inappropriate.. he's 30, I'm 20, and I met him when i was 16.. we've been together for four years.      What does this sound like to you? I'm going crazy
20090223092210AAwnoBg	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it wrong of me not to go?	My best friend is pregnant.  Ever since she announced it, all I have been bombarded with is "When are you going to have a baby?"  followed by "Before she can have a baby, she needs a boyfriend!".  I just got the invite for the shower and am sort of dreading going because of all the remarks I am going to get hit with.  Most of the women that are going to be there are either married or in relationships and/or have children.  Is it bad for me not to attend since I really don't want to deal with all the comments, or do I just suck it up and go since she is my best friend?  I love her to death and would be there in a heartbeat if I truly thought it would matter, but I honestly don't think it will.  She and I were the last single ladies out of our group of friends and ever since she met her boyfriend and is now expecting, we haven't seen much of each other.  Whenever i have tried to schedule plans with her, there is always an excuse.  The ladies seem to exclude me from the activities and the reason I usually get is "You're single, you would have been bored hanging around us listening to all the talk about relationships and babies since you can't relate".  Since it seems like I'm slowly being phased out of the friendships since "I can't relate", should I go to the shower or not?
20090223093033AAx7VWO	Family & Relationships;Family	What label would you give my mom for this?	My mom has serious control issues, I am guessing.  My dad was killed in a car accident when I was 5 years old. My mom raised us on her own ever since. My siblings and I are all adults now, but my mom still throws fits if we do not wait on her hand and foot.  She gets mad if people do not come over and take out her trash for her or do things around her house for her.  She is only 59 years old and is perfectly capable of doing all these things for herself.  She always wants people to come over and clean her house for her, wash her car, things like that.  When we were kids she use to tell us all the the time that we were trying to kill her and that we were all so mean to her if we did not do every little thing for her.  She would love to have slaves who waited on her all day. What behavior would you call this and what would cause a person to act this way? She was always very spoiled by her own parents and has never really had to do anything for herself. She sits at home all day and watches tv, yet wants me to come over and clean and cook and all this stuff that is NOT my responsibility. She demands that we all roll out the red carpet on mother's day and her birthday and of course nothing we do is ever good enough. Is she just spoiled rotten?

20090223092910AA3xtX3	Family & Relationships;Family	My boyfriend broke up with me because i relapsed with my ED and cutting(little long)?	me and my boyfriend have been together for almost a year. the first 3 months of our relationship i had been in the hospital 2 times for anorexia and bulima and cutting. he stuck by my side and helped me get through it and was one of my best support systmes. he never judged me and he was a big reason i wanted to get better. he hated that i was slowly killing myself and the fact that i cut really hurt him. the 2nd time i got out of the hospital he told me that if i cut again he couldnt stay with me because he didnt want to watch the girl he was in love with kill herself. i was doing really good for a long time. about 2 months ago my eating disorder crept back into my head and since then i lost almost 15 pounds. he obviously noticed but i had mono so i used this as an excuse for my weight. he would ask my what i had eaten that day and i would lie. not eating has messed up my mood again and ive become a little depressd. we got in a really big fight and i dont know why but i cut myself. he saw it and got really mad. we got into a huge fight and he told me that he cant be with me, he just wants me to concentrate on myself and get better so he broke up with me. he told me that he didnt want to break up but he cant watch me do this again. he says that he didnt break up with me BEACAUSE of my ed&cutting but because he wants me to get better. i dont belive that tho, i am more pissed then upset because i need him now and i feel like he is walking away when i need him most. i dont know what to do! this happening is only making things worse in  my mind. what do youthink? how should i deal with this?!

Yes i do have thinning hair, but it isnt bad, i had other girls tell me its not bad. So yea, according to her, looks are 100 percent important and all she talks about how "hot" a guy is. Anyway this is a person that had a child with a guy that wont pay child support, she contracted 3 STDS! (HPV, Herpes, and trichinomoses) Yet... she claims to know what girls want.. What do you think?

20090223093304AAwgaK1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about my boyfriends mom.?	the day before valentines day i was suspended for texting in class. i was also grounded at home for it so no fun day.      My boyfriends mom called me and told me that my boyfriend was with her and his grandpa. So his grandpa asks her to do something for him but she wanted my boyfriend to do it. He doesnt want to and starts to get an attitude. They only have one car at the moment and so she said he thought he had to come get me so thats why he couldnt do it. I never told him he had to get me so idk what she was talking about. Then she starts telling me how he never does anything for her anymore and pretty much saying all he cares about is me and doesnt do **** around the house. Trying to blame it on me or something.      So i like agree with her saying he needs to do stuff around the house or whatever. you know. so then we hang up.      i call my boyfriend and tell him she called me and was saying im the reason you dont do anything for her anymore. and stuff like that. it really pissed me off. So he tells me to hang up and he will call me back. I dont want to call him back cause if i hang up he will call her and go off on her. but he doesnt listen.      She calls me about a couple minutes later and i ignore it. she left a voicemail saying. " what did you do call marcus and tell him i went off on you or something, cause no sooner i got off the phone with you he called me. so im telling you now you keep your fat *** out of my house and if you come to my house i will call the cops on your *** and i dont care what mark says you cant come to my house. yall mother ******* go lay up somewhere else cause you arent welcome here."

20090223093354AALklRe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need help! My husband gets very agitated and difficult to be around if we go without sex for a week or more?	We have been married for 7 years, have great sex when we do have it.  He wants it all the time (which is normal for men I understand), but isn't this the real world?  Isn't it pretty good to have sex at least once a week? Also, it definitely turns me off when he asks me for sex 20 times before I leave the house in the morning...

20090223094825AAEQeKW	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please read. I need advice so badly :/?	Alright,   this may take up a tad bit of your time...   But please, continue reading.      Okay.. well i've been with this boy for about one month and a half.   But the twist is i'm currently in 9th grade and I started liking him in the 7th grade and we dated for about a day.. then he broke up with me. Anyways.. I finally got the nerve to tell him over this last summer and it turned out that he liked me as well. Sooo there was just a big problem that ws keeping us from dating and that was the fact that I was on home school and he attended public school. SO it was kinda like a.. I'll never see you thing if we dated so we decided that when I come to his school that we would date. Keep in mind I was only home schooled for a bit because I needed my grades to come up before I could go back to public school and I didn't want to go to one of those alternative schools.. Or mostly my parents wouldn't agree to have me attend such a school. Anyways...  We talked for about four months and you know... he'd call me every so often like once every two weeks.. I hated that. I wished he called me more. :/ But I don't have the guts to tell him that. We both stayed single for each other. He called me babe and his girl. and all that good stuff.. We'd argue about who likes who more. (BUT WE were not dating yet.) Soo the day finally came were I was going to go to his school for the first time. I mean I knew HELLA people there so it wasn't like I was the "New girl." I didn't really have it rough. haha. But uhm.. The first day he saw me and he wouldn't let me go when he hugged me. God I loved it.. I just wanted to stay in his arms forever. :] I'm a real shy person.. and i let him know that as well... The second day he asked me out over the phone after school.. Btw! I know this is kinda bad.. but I kissed him before we were dating... :/   Back to the main point. >.<   We get into sooo many fights and about the littlest stuff...   For example;   If I don't say I love you to the amount that satifies him that day then he complains about it and that gets me kinda pissed off..   And hm... One time he was all like, "yay summers coming up soon, I get to see you in fun clothes." Or.. "Please wear short shorts on monday! I'll love you forever." That got me really pissed off and I let him hear it. haha.   Uhm.. He does that thing with kisses too! If I don't give him enough I hear it..   Idk.. we just get in little arguements a lot. All of my friends don't approve.. and my best friend say's she's caught him flirting around.. and come on SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND... and has been since the 1st grade. I mean, I basically trust her with my life. So I confront him about it and he denys it and he say's, "I would never do that to you, I love you too much to hurt you, why don't you believe me?" And I tell him that it's my best friend why would she lie to me? I KNOW for a fact that she deosn't want to date him btw. And he just gets all mad at the fact that I won't believe him.. HIS BEST FRIEND has even told me that he flirts with other girls! SO when I found this out we got in a hugeeeeeee fight about it and his excuse was, "Why would you listen to him, you know how many guy's want you!" God... it's just I can't take much more of this.. Anyways... this fight thing over him flirting around happened twice. BUt after I talked to him about it the 2nd time he stopped... I haven't heard anything about it since then.. I mean the 2nd time he was very very very close to losing me. Maybe he learned his lesson or something?   But hmm.. idk.. he's a bit sexual and all that stuff as well. And I have a promise ring and I let him know that. No sex till marriage. We almost broke up because of that. I mean.. if he thinks that i'm going to give in! He's horribly wrong. haha.      Basically the reason why I wrote this is because I wanted to see what you guy's thought about his doings and what I should do..      Help? :]

I plan to leave my significant other. he does not know. we own a house together, and owe a mortgage on it together.       i have made all payments since day one.      it was once brought up in conversation that he would insist on keeping the house himself or we would have to sell. he would rather it be foreclosed on than see me get it.      1. is there any way to force him to sign off and let me keep the house?   2. what would be the legalities involved if i signed off the home into his name only and left? would i still be responsible for paying the mortgage?      he doesn't care about his credit. he will let the bank take it back just to ruin my credit.

And no it is not because i am ugly or anything :/      well he seemed like a pretty smart guy at first, and the regular guy who gets his flirt on at times.

Last night we hung out as friends and when I left it came time for the-hug. I went in for the frienship hug with arms at different angles. He kissed me on the  right cheek, then put both arms below mine. One on upper back and one on lower and squeezed me close to him. What does this mean? Does he still have feelings? I broke up with him and when I decided I still cared he said things had changed between us and he didn't want me anymore. (this was last tuesday..hug on sunday).

I was thinking about getting my Maid of Honor something else, but when I think about it, 3 of the girls (including the MOH) have each helped out equally, while 3 of the others have not helped much at all. I am not upset or anything about the other girls, I was just wondering if I should  buy all three of the ones who have helped something extra, or just the MOH? Or should I just stick to the bracelets?       I don't want to offend the 3 who haven't helped as much. It doesn't bother me, as I know they are not my slaves, I was just thinking about recognizing those who did help... What do you think I should do?      Also, if You do think I should get them or the MOH something else, what should it be? I am on a low budget, and they already don't have to pay for their hair...
20090223095005AACgalU	Family & Relationships;Family	Fight with parents....I need help?	On my 21st birthday my parents came to the bar along with about 7 aunts and uncles. My parents had got me cupcakes. When I asked for one my mom said there wasn't any more. She went around and offered them to people I didn't even know at the bar. They stayed for about 20 mins and never said good bye. They didn't even get me a card for my birthday.   5 days after my birthday my grandfather passed away. I had left my car at my parents house and rode with them for the viewing at the funeral home. The next day they were going to come get me at my house. But never came. I broke my cell phone 2 days before this so I had no way to call anyone.  When I sent them a message online to my moms cell she said they ran out of time. So I missed the closing of the casket. Then they wanted me to walk to the church where the service was...it's about half mile from my house and its was 14 outside. I finally woke the little old lady next door to take me. When I got there and told my mom how upset I was she pretty much just said get over it. It's not a big deal. They also told my family that my car was stuck in the snow. Thats why I didn't make it.    I stopped talking to my parents for about a week after this. Then I got a puppy for v-day and they didn't say anything about him. Just jumped me about how I'm going to take care of him. Since my boyfriend and I both work. (the longest my puppy will be alone is 4 hours twice a week)    My mom texted me last night and wanted me to go to the mall with her. I said I will call her today. But the truth is I'm not sure I'm ready to talk to her yet. Let alone hang out with her....HELP! How should I handle this...its been about a month since my birthday and grandpas death.

I met someone this past weekend and he asked me out. I took his number, and said I might call... I probably won't, because I like this other guy I've been seeing for a month.

20090223100924AAjCtKI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have a really bad gut feeling about what happened....?	my  husband and i are currently separated, but as far as i knew we were trying to work it out.  he was supposed to come over at 11AM on saturday morning to meet me and have lunch/talk.  He never came, i called over and over but he never answered and his phone was turned off.  A couple of times when I called i could tell he was on the other line, then he would answer and hang up on me.  I called his friends and also stopped by his place to see if he was there.  but nobody knew anything and he wasn't home.  He called at 430Pm said he had a surprise... then he showed up at 6PM with flowers but he had this look on his face that I know... something happened.  I asked him what happened all day, he said he slept in and felt bad so he ignored me.  This makes no sense to me, not at all.  I told him, its 6PM... sorry, but what happened that would even make you sleep in that late?  he said he was playing cards all nite with a friend...  i asked him to take his flowers and leave, this story makes no sense.  he didn't answer to me, never called, never showed up on time... i asked him why he wasn't home, he said he got up at 2PM to buy me flowers... but why would buying flowers take 4 hours?  doesn't make sense to me.      I have asked him several questions about what happened because something doesn't feel right... something happened and i really don't feel he is being honest.  when I ask him quesitons, he gets mad and says not to investigate him please.  its hurtful to me, he doesn't show up when he is supposed to and pretty much hides from me... and still doesnt have the decency to tell me the truth.        i have such a bad bad feeling inside about this, he asked me to move on from it... but i really don't feel i can.  we are already separated, and this bad feelings inside is telling me this guy is never going to try at this.  what do you think?  should i follow my gut here?
20090223075748AA37ki9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Who has had experience with emergency custody?	I asked a question earlier about "my exboyfriend" taking me to court for 50% child custody after not paying child support at all for 5 years except for 4 months and then it wasnt enough.  This question was really for my friend.  Someone made a comment that "I" sounded like I just didnt want to pay child support myself.  I seriously doubt that is my friends case.  Her boyfriend wanted her to get an abortion with the first one then also with their second child.  When she first established child support 5 years after she had her first one (only 5 months ago) she was sick and tired of paying for everything on her own.  Recently had to take a second job while her babys father is living off another woman.  The story goes on and on....  long story short she is a real woman trying to get her ex to do the right thing.  She doesnt keep her kids from him in fact she just got tired of pleading with him to come and visit the kids.  Don't judge people who ask questions.  They are just looking for an answer.

He says that he met this girl, who he swore on our sons life that he didnt do anything but talk and flirt, and how it feels good that another girl likes him BLABLABLABAL.

20090223100502AAFgc4V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell this guy how upset I am, or should I cut him off completely?	There's this guy who I have met at a choir rehearsal that I attended. He seems to be a level headed, musically talented, and a Christian man when I first met him, which is really my type. Unfortunately, I saw the total opposite when I finally decided to have a one on one time with him. I got the impression that he tried to sleep with me. He mentioned renting a hotel room, but this was our first time meeting up with each other. He had the nerve ask me if I never had a one night stand, if I'm a good kisser, and other intimate questions. I felt it was hypocritical for him to ask me these questions because he gave me the impression that he was a Christian, especially based on his actions in church. Also, I grew up in church and was told that the men in church are worse! Also, I even looked at his myspace and it said that he was married!   I don't want to be to harsh but I still want to tell him how I felt. How would you guys handle this situation, and should I tell him about it or leave it alone?

20090223100740AAD5VCL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I forgive my girlfriend for kissing another guy?	Ok, apparently she got really drunk the other night when she was out with her friends. A guy offered to take them home because my girlfriend was so drunk she couldn't walk, and on the ride home they apparently kissed (i think it was only a peck, but still). She is a freshman in college, and she has never really drunk anything before. I am mad at her because I told her she was going to get drunk and cheat on me. She said she wouldn't, but I knew she was going to do it. I think my girlfriend is also mad at me because I got into a fight with her parents, and they hate me now. They want talk to her because she is dating me, and I think she blames me. I don't know what to do. She was extremely drunk, but I don't feel like that is a good excuse. I use to drink a lot so I know what happens. What should I do? She did tell me right after it happened.

20090223091330AAI2j9q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me????	i like a strip club waitress(fully clothed). she finally agreed to see me outside of that place. i have a friend that is a stripper who i have known since high school. the stripper knows how much i like the waitress. the stripper went out with the waitress and some other coworkers the other night. the waitress told me the stripper badmouthed her the whole time. she once said to me why dont u give up on her. come to my party and i promise you'll get laid. tonight i went to the club and the stripper said "are u here to see ur girlfriend" sarcastically. she offered me a dance and i turned her down. she said "it's because she's here isn't it." while i was at the club i talked to the waitress for a while. when she walked away my stripper friend came over to my table said "whatever" and walked away. is my stripper friend jealous. does she like me? i dont get why she would be mean to the girl i like. i thought we were friends

20090223094521AAxM7oG	Family & Relationships;Family	Was it my fault?   I think he could have been helped....but they gave him up....and its my fault?	This was 13 years ago but I was looking through old pictures.   (My current dog is ill and I'm dealing with it and not well and this is bringing up old memories of past dogs)      He had siezures and he did some not so nice things but I'm starting to think its my fault.      Here is what he did and I think I'm the reason why:       was always getting yelled at for not cleaning my room right and for leaving a mess.....and I was a kid so there was a lot of yelling. He didn't like my Dad because my dad was always yelling      One day I back talked at my mom (this was the day) and she spanked me and that is when he turned on her and went at her. He didn't bite her but he showed his teeth and growled at her until she stepped away from me      He was protecting me. When he bit my friend it was when she pushed me down. We had an arguement. And he bit her leg.      her mom didn't press charges....he didn't even break the skin and she knew how much that dog meant to me. And she still let her daughter come over. (As long as Pongo was crated)      Once again he was defending me. I'm certain he never would have hurt me and I feel its my fault he did those things.      Got into a fight with an american bulldog and a golden retriever.      The dogs he went after came into our yard while I was on the swingset....one dog charged for me and I managed to get up to the top (it had a fort on it) and Pongo chased them both off. With the help of my dad.      He flipped his cage down the stairs trying to get after my cousins      As far as my cousins they were rowdy boys who always were pulling on his tail and ears and throwing things at him and me.      All those things involved me. He was protecting me. So its my fault they got rid of him.         I'm trying to let go but I know its my fault. If he wasn't constantly defending me.      For some reason he thought he had to protect me...and he didn't.      (Maybe it had to due with the abuse he got before he came to live with us but these problems didn't start until he was around 2 years old)      Was it my fault?
20090223093457AAfoZCe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think is going through his head and can we work it out without a divorce?	My husband recently told me that he wants a divorce, but he still wants to remain friends. He actually wants to start our relationship all over again and see if we marry again. His explanation is that the foundation of our marriage is so damaged that we have to tear it down and start all over again so that we have a strong marriage if we get remarried. We have to have an 18 month separation and we may take a longer one if need be. He says he cares about me a lot and is doing this because he doesn't want to hurt me. He also says that if we end up married he wants to know it was for the right reasons. Many people who know him say that they believe during the separation he will decided that he wants to work things out and come home without a divorce. What do you think is going on? I know for a fact that he is not involved with anyone else because we are always together. Please no rude comments...I am just trying to figure things out and find a way to restore my marriage with the least amount of pain.  We have no assets or anything of value...We have been through a great deal of stress lately and at times in his past he has blacked out when under a great deal of stress.  He is afraid that if he stays...he will black out and hurt me.  He still wears his ring and spends time with me.  Do you think he really wants a divorce?  Do you think that once he leaves and gets to missing me he will come home?

20090223101031AAkWiOa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get over him?	My boyfriend of 2 years just broke up with me. He says that he hasnt been feeling the same about us for the last 2 weeks. We live about 45 minutes from each other, so for 2 years we have only been seeing each other once a week, twice if we are REALLY lucky. He broke up with me on saturday Feb 21st and he came over for us to say final goodbyes on sunday. We kissed and held each other and talk about staying in touch and being friends, but I'm afriad that we wont be able to be friends bc we have never known anything but our dating relationship. We both still love each other, and I used to talk to him everyday, several times a day. I put all of his pictures and presents he had given me over the last 2 years away, so that I wont look at it and miss him even more. My question is what is the best way to get over the man I love?      Ps. I was thinking about breaking up with him, just bc I knew he was not gonna be the person I would marry, but I wasnt ready to say goodbye to him yet, so I didnt end up doing it. I am not in HS so I am mature enough to know that there are other people in this world that can be meant for me.

20090223001019AAjNWO7	Family & Relationships;Family	I realized my parents were totally f**ked up even if they did their best and it's made it so hard for me?	my dad was a closet transvestite.  he once asked us to hide in the closet so his girlfriend of many years wouldn't know his children were living with him. we had 4 telephones so we wouldn't answer either of his 2 phones when she called.     my mother was extremely obese 5 foot two and over 300 pounds.  she would fall in love with her therapist or the pastor at the church and imagine they were in love with her.  she later got evicted from her apartment as there was a major cockroach investation and she wouldn't let them exterminate.  and one time i called her in college and she said i didn't sound like me and hung up. when she hadn't answered for days, my sister got the police to go into her apartment and she said, 'that's not my daughter'. she got better later with anti depressants and maybe anti-psychotics when she was in a nursing home.  i have always tried to see the best in people, but at present i'm miserable recognizing how hard it's been for me to be in a happy relationship having had crazy parents.  people tend to be drawn to me, initially and i have some good long  and medium term friends.  i'm smart and i look fine, but i always choose the wrong partners and i've wasted so much time and i'm just recognizing this and starting to grieve deeply.

My friend & her boyfriend had sex in my & my husband's bed while I was out of town visiting my husband (he's in the military).  When I found out I got P.O.'d to say the least and called her and told her the next time they wanted to screw around to get a hotel room or use their own d*mn bed & that is was just VERY disrespectful.  However, she took what I had to say and just apologized without trying to justify it or anything so I let it go but told her to not do it again.

20090223004926AARrZGx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In need of advice about two men..Are they playing games?	Guy #1-Asks about me through other people, for example,through my immediate co-worker George, and,through another manager-he asks"So how are you guys doing over there",he says that everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else for that matter.He's also called up to my job three times,blocking out his number, asking for my whereabouts and told my co-worker that he wanted to meet me, but he never showed.so i called him to chat, we talked for over two hours, and he Told me I can definetly call him anytime. And Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there which was weird   Guy#2   Mostly talks to me over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that, you'll get me in trouble". He Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me in person, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.The thing is that I've asked this guy if Guy #1 was single or married, so he knows that I sort of have a thing for Guy #1, because they are good friends.So when I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers, or he will not answer my text message.   So The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and he asked him, if he wanted to talk to me, so when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.so it was weird because hes married with kids, and he knows I like Guy #1...so I don't know if he has a thing for me, or Guy #1 does

At first I just thought: Meh? Just a guy.   2) I met him a few more times. Every few months so not often.   3) Started to like him.   4)More...   5) ...and more...   6)...and more.   7)I am now crazy about him   8) I have him as a friend on myspace.   9) I dont think he likes me back   10) I met him at a family thing but he is in NO WAY related to me.   11) He did a bulletin on myspace saying: YOU+ME+MY ROOM+24HOURS=________.   12) What should I put?   13) All my friends know that I am just dying to be with him.   14) To be honest- I dont think he likes me- all I can do is hope.   15) What do I do??   16) BTW is single.      Also- we are both 14- i am turning 15 in a month and he is 2 months after me.   PLEASE MORE ANSWERS> you have no idea how much this has been tormenting me- I have had dreams about him regularly for 6 months!!!      The problem is....   if I tell him I like him and it turns out he doesnt like me, what will it be like on the other family get-togethers???   He would totally blank me, making it sooo boring, plus parents might find out which is not so great. Plus the fact that I may or may not decide to commit suicide- not just from that, but because my life sucks completely and utterly.

20090223101020AAkyeop	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this guy a JERK? should i regret this?	Long story short. I was casually seeing someone for 6 months. He had feelings for his ex. I had a hunch about this but gave him a chance. After she moved to the city, he contacted me less. The next time we hung out, he called me her name while in bed. Closed his eyes, humiliated. I handled it reasonably, asked him to be honest. He confessed his feelings, said I deserve so much better, I'm awesome, he'd never do it again.      He then NEVER talked to me for over a month.....until the other night. I got a text. Said he thought he saw me somewhere, was scared to  say hi, that i must really hate him and think he's horrible. he felt bad so he tried to kept his distance. i dont know WHY i texted back but said a) im not a scary person b) i dont think hes horrible c) i dont hold grudges and d) if it was me and i saw him i wouldve said hi anyway.      I'd never date him again, he's NOT worth it. Im just a forgiving person and like to be on good terms with people. BUT after I responded, he never texted back. again, i feel dumb for being nice. My friend says I should ignore him-- that he just wanted to see if he still had a chance. Do you think replying was a bad idea? any advice??

Last november he told me to get out of his life and not to talk to him. In december we were both in the same house and he confessed that he really loves me and every time he sees me he just wants to kiss me but he doesnt because he knows im not okay with it.   So we dated again for a month and then things fell apart. He said i wasnt showing him enough affection then said i was smothering him. And then that i wasnt communicating enough and then he would ignore all my calls.   he eventually got a cell phone and texted me a week ago and said sorry for how things ended but he was just into someone else.       What should I make of all this?

We worked as a team.       Seems like all we do is argue. We have children. They hear it. I cant stand being in the room. He is ready to defend himself. As am I. We cant be intimate with fighting.    Nothing is working. We can not communicate without screaming .    I have a perminate knot in my throat all day long.    I love him, he says he loves me. But we cant stop.    What can we do to save ourselves.

20090223093925AAiw8mn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do some guys date single mothers?	Why do some guys date single mothers? You already know their stance on abortion ... they won't have one. Don't risk paying alimony or child support. Her kids will always be #1 in her life, and do you really want to take second-place to a woman? I didn't think so. Why support another man's mistake? How do you know she's not looking for a support figure? Or someone to support her financially? Think of all that, and realize that the odds are stacked against you. She's already had one mistake. The last guy didn't stick around. Why should you?      This isn't to say that some of them aren't very nice, have been screwed over by ex-husbands, or would be very great mates. But if you're just looking to get laid, they are a definite off-limits. More than likely, you're hooking up with a girl who wants another try at something she messed up the first time. With the hostility of today's legal system towards men, you just don't want to take the chance.      Some men have been ordered by the courts to pay child support to their former wives, even though they were not the biological father of her children. This financially ruins men for many years making them unable to start a new life with another woman or enjoy the money they earn.

Im 15 and have a boyfriend who i have been dating for quite a while and i really really like. My best friend is good friends with him aswell and lives on his compound so sees him after school quite often. Also before we started dating my friend was telling me that this guy ( my bf) liked me and maybe my best friend.   My best friend just broke up with her bf and as a joke i asked her if it was because she liked someone else. She said it was irrelevent but yes she did. So i got suspicious and now she is telling me that she isnt gonna flirt with this guy not for a while at least. She wont tell me who it is either.   Im so scared that she likes my bf, Mark and that he might start to if not already like her....!!!

I am 21 and have been talking to a man online via telephone and im for about 2 months. Him and I met on an online dating site and everything has been going good. The thing is that he is  33 but has demonstrated that he is a kind person and seems to want something serious. He has told me all about his divorce from his as well as other intimate matters in his life.      . He is coming to the state that I live in today for a lunch date. I am like very nervous and afraid that I am gonna make an idiot out of myself bc I have never dated an older guy before. Thus far he has proven himself to be a gentlemen and he is even driving from Mississipi to Louisiana to see me. What advice would you give me on this situation. He should be here in a few minutes from MI. He is planning on coming to my college campus and we are just getting lunch together.      I am just quite nervous bc i have never met a guy this old before via net. I typically date guys around my own age but i just got fed up on the bs.      Advice please. :)      thanks

20090223092814AAhd6UD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just get over it, or is it too much to just let go?	I am in a serious relationship and have been for almost 8 years now.  We recently got engaged, but I am starting to have my doubts.  There is about a 5 year age difference between us, and we are complete opposites but that seems to be why we work so well... We just balance each other out.        The main issue that I am having at the moment is I am really attracted to someone I work with.  I would never cheat on my bf, but because I am having these feelings about someone else I am starting to wonder if being engaged is a good idea.        The guy that I am working with is also in a relationship, but there is definitely something there.  We have so much in common, and I do sometimes get the feeling that he feels the same, even to the point where I think he is getting jealous when I am around other guys I work with.  His behavior changes when my bf calls me at work, and sometimes I actually feel guilty when I talk to my bf even though I haven't really done anything wrong!  We rarely talk about our partners, and I am wondering if what we are doing is starting to get beyond the point of being just 'innocent'.      I am feeling so guilty.  I love my bf, and we have so much history but this guy I work with just makes me feel so happy.  I am really stuck about what to do...

He told me he doesn't really have fun when i'm around and as of now any quality time spent is more of an obligation.  He didn't go into detail about it.  i do have one dilema.  I've been reading his letters to and from my sister (he doesn't hide them though i don't think he wants me reading them).  He told her what we are going to do and how he hates the fact that i've castrated him so horribly.  He said he wont be surprised if i left again considering he's officially given up his rights as the man in the relationship.  How do i show that he's not less of a man for my mistakes, im less of a woman because of it.  i've noticed how he ok's everything i ask for with out question and won't put up any kind of fight.  We both believe that the man as provider is head of the family, and im worried that he is just going to give up his place.  I can't run this family.   How do i prove to him that i NEED him to be the leader in our family?

20090223043212AApKy7l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I disappear on him?	I have a long distance boyfriend who was supposed to move to my city  to be closer to me. He came for 2 job interviews and thought they went well but unfortunately he didnt get the job, Because of the financial crisis, it was difficult for him to find any other job (my city is prety badly hit).   He then went back to his city and was offered a promotion in his current job there, I told him to take it because it might be the only job he'll find.    Since his decision to take the new job, he has started talking to me a lot less. He has begun coming online less to chat, less texting, and less phoning. He talks to me maybe 2-3 times a week and when he does he's very affectionate. He disappeared on me for 6 days. I didn't contact him in this time, as I wanted to test him. He finally contacted me over facebook after those six days but acted like nothing happened.   We were having a text conversation a 2 days ago and he suddenly stopped replying. What should I do? Should I talk to him about this? I feel like his actions show he is pretty much done with our relationship.   It seems like this is his way of ending it, but I could be wrong.   Could anyone please give me some advice on how to handle this?

20090223000630AAxuN3l	Family & Relationships;Family	What would you do if your mother-in-law was constanlty rude?	She has always been rude...(I mean the first words out of her mouth when she met me was "you are on birth control right?!!?) and when my husband decided he wanted to change his carreer and become a cop, she called and left me a voice mail saying what a horrible wife i was for letting him do it, (i don't know how long the message was i stopped it after the 3rd minute).   I was just wondering what other people would do if they were in my shoes. Any suggestions would be appreciated!       (I know most people are going to say just talk to her, I have but she doesn't listen and just goes onto say that I am just having a "bipolar moodswing" and will just ignore what i have to say)
20090223100641AAB3jd9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friends guy just told me that he likes me alot more than her!?	what do i do?      he is very cute but im taken and would never consider it at all      but shes my friend so should i tell her or should i just leave it alone?
20090223004255AAo2iOn	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you think of this family situation?	Ok this is a true situation - clearly I will not mention names and locations etc.      This is a family I only know of so I know I can not pass judgement - I just wanted everyone's thoughts on it.      The mother is in her late 30s (I would say about 36-38)   She has 3 kids:  21 year old daughter, 19 year old son, 14 year old son   The family home is,I would say, like my home; a small flat with 3/4 bedrooms      The mother is a cleaner at the local high school, I know she has had a tough life where she is now on her own after her children's father left and her 2 older sisters died in a car crash. She has had to cope on her own and I think she finds it very hard. My own mother says that she was a very nice person when she knew her, and that she felt really sorry for where her life had landed her. She is a reformed alcoholic (for 5 years).. She was a SAHM up until last year.       The 21 year old lives at the family home with her 2 kids who are around 3 and under 1. The 3 year olds father is currently in jail for robbery, and the baby's father is basically a drug using muppet who is around 16-18. The 21 year old is a SAHM.       The 19 year old son lives there also with his 7 month pregnant girlfriend and her child (girlfriend is about 22-25, and the kid is 5) - they did have their own council house but with regard to rumour, they got kicked out due to disrupting the peace. The girlfriends kid has been suspended from school twice already - he has only been there a year! The 19 year old is on the dole at the moment, though he did work in construction for some time. The girlfriend is a SAHM who works for AVON on the side from home.      The 14 year old son has just been kicked out of school for the 3rd time, and the school is refusing to have him back on the grounds due to his behaviour. He spends his time between his mothers house and his fathers. . he is known to dapple in drugs especially when he is at his fathers where he mucks around with his older sisters baby's father (the drug using muppet) . He is also on some sort of police watch for his anti social behaviour.. he has a curfew etc although I would not say he was sticking to it as I saw him out about at around 11pm.                Again, like I said above.... This is a family I only know of so I know I can not pass judgement - I just wanted everyone's thoughts on it.      It is wrong to judge, but what is your very first impression about this?    If you were in this situation - what would you do to help the family/change the impressions?   How would you feel if you were the mother/daughter/son/son/kids?   And mainly, do you think the social services have a right to get involved for the sake of the kids?

20090223100112AAu61BC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's it like to have a conscience?	I have spent my entire life considering my own feelings, I am amoral, selfish and wicked. That is how I like it. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing others suffer.   Recently however, I felt a strange and wholly unfamiliar feeling in my brain. It started when my head valet passed away this month, and I thought he would make a terrific hatstand. Without a moments hesitation I called in the taxidermist and had him stuffed. Anyway moving on, it wasn't until my son Cecil (9 years old) held my hand and called, father, as he pointed at the hatstand, isn't that Graham our eldest member of staff. I failed to reply. But, do you know, as I looked into my son's  eyes, that is when this strange unpleasant feeling came to me. Is this what having a conscience feels like?   How is it gotten rid of?
20090223095530AAg8kVE	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do...please help?	So I recently helped my sister escape from her extremely mentally abusive husband. I paid for the flight and all other expenses for her and her two children. She's been living with me for a couple weeks now and has just informed me that her psycho husband has promised her a car in exchange for her return. Now she isn't even asking me what I think about the whole situation, just that she's made up her mind and is going back to him.   I love my sister and I only want what's best for her so what can I really say when we (the entire family) know this man is sick and soooo bad for her but she - who claims she has no love for this man - refuses to get away from him but want to continue to cry to us about all the crap he does to her day in and day out, knowing we can't do anything about it. Also would it be wrong to demand all the money I spent to fly her out back?

What if you have some signficant issues, but your spouse either refuses to discuss it, or they just won't change...  yet you don't want a divorce.  You go to counseling, but it doesn't help.  They say all the right things at the counselor, but they don't really change.  It becomes clear that it's their way or the highway.      Once you let them have their way, you establish that they are in control.  So what do you do?

20090223081134AABN0zw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does he really wants me back or his stuff?	My husband and I went to court for temporary orders.  We lived in his house so all the furniture is still in his house.  Now that I am moving back into mine house and I need some furniture and stuff. The first court date my atty missed so my husband was granted whatever he wanted by default.  So a new court date was set. I was given half of many of the furniture included the 46" Plasma TV which my husband loves death.  That afternoon I got a text that he is tired of whole thing and the next day he wanted me come back and end the divorce.  We argued and I caught him in a bunch of lies and I told him that he is a liar and I can never trust him again.  He left me a message on my phone begging me to call him back and I didn't.  The next day I called him and he didn't answer me.  It's been three days now.  Has he given up?  Do you think he really wants me back?  Since I caught him in several lies, did he give up? Is he thinking on how to cover up for the lies? One of my friends feel that he hasn't given up on me yet.  He is just trying to figure how you know stuff and how to cover for those lies.  Is that true?

20090223100142AAy5bUw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend drug troubles, Any one got advice?	My boyfriend of 14 months, who i love dearly, is really worrying me.he recently admitted that he was selling weed. I kinda knew this but wanted to trust him. This all started about a week ago when he really wanted a four wheeler but didn't have enough money. I volunteered to help but had to quit my job because of soccer season coming up. He knows that I will not date a guy that smokes weed or does any other unnecessary drug. He told me he was dirving around one day (this is before he admitted to selling weed) and just wanted some space. I didnt say anything just said okay babe. When he told me he sold it I put the peices together and realized that the day he was "driving around" was when he was doing all of this. The strange thing is that about a week and a half ago he gave his friend (that actively smokes weed) a ride and dropped him off at some dealers house, and then back to his friends house. He came back smelling like straight up weed, along with his car, but swears up and down neither his friend nor him smoked any in the car or anything. That the reason he smelled like it was because his friend brought the weed back into the car. He also said he stepped into his friends house to get a quick bite to eat. I am not really sure how is car smelled this bad, along with his clothes if they didnt. He refuses to take a drug test, becuase i made him take one earlier in our relationship, and he passed it so i said i would never test him agian (BIG MISTAKE!). I really dont know what to do and i dont think that breaking up with him is an option. Anyways any help is great. Thanks!!!
20090223085735AA2GN9n	Family & Relationships;Family	My boyfriend is threatening me and my cousin...?	it all began when my cousin txted him to see if he was cheating on me or not, eventually he fell for everything and said "come on over if you want this" and etc, so i ended up txting him back sayin that i was the one txting and that it was over. after that he started txting and saying that he wanted me back. and i told him he didnt deserve any more chances, cuz i gave him like 4 already within the whole year we were together. But he wouldnt have it so he said he wouldnt stop txting until he got me back. i told him i was done and to stop txting and leave us alone. (this went on till about 3 in the morning) and i had to get up at 6 for school. sooo.... he then left two voicemails on the phone saying how he was gonna come and break in the house and slit our necks, and saying how he has a gun. and all this other ****. so we stayed up for awhile. then he txted back sayin that he was at the exit, and sure enouph about 4 minutes later he's driving down our road laying on the horn. then he turns around and does it again goin the opposite way, and then he does it for a third  time. Then he i guess he finally went back to his appt. so we were like if you wanna do something come in the driveway and we'll kick ur ***. (he is a coward btw, so its like he is scared of getting into fights) but he did also leave a voicemail sayin that he is not afraid to hit girls, and if he seen me and my cousin in public he was gonna slap and punch me. (btw, the day before valentine's day he threw me up against the wall and started choking me and i broke up with him ON valentines day and called my dad and told him to come get me) i am at school right now and i talked to the assistant principal about talking to a police officer here, but havnt yet got called down yet. i was just curious on the types of charges he will get faced with if he is 18. (and the whole part about abusing me)....      thank you sooo much...

20090223095840AA1R8ni	Family & Relationships;Family	Regarding social etiquette and my child's father...?	Sorry, this might be lengthy...      Generally speaking, my ex, my current husband, and I all have a cordial relationship with one another for the sake of my daughter (now 8 years old).  During the last six years of my current marriage, my husband and I have allowed my ex to come to our house so he can visit with his daughter.  We have also welcomed him to family functions (holidays & her birthday parties) to allow him to take part in these special occasions with her.  Recently however, my ex has gotten a little too comfortable when he comes to visit.  He brings food over to warm up for himself in our microwave, he'll help himself to drinks from our fridge or snacks from our pantry, he'll kick his feet up on the couch as he sits to watch a movie with our daughter, and he has started to conveniently schedule his visits around 4 or 5 PM just in time to pull up a chair and sit with us during our dinners!  He's even been bold enough to ask for a plate!  And the newest of all?  He has started bringing his female friend along for his visits!  Don't get me wrong, I am by no means jealous but I just find it rude that he invites other people to my home without first telling me.  It's not only awkward because I don't know her, but it's an imposition because I usually have to be the one to keep her entertained during the visit because she doesn't really have an interest in my daughter.  Without seeming rude or hurtful to him and his friend, how do we tell him that our home is our home and he needs to be respectful of that?  Another thing to consider is my daughter.  If we come off too harsh, my daughter will think we're the monsters in this situation.          I know my husband and I are partly to blame for his comfort level by allowing him into our home in the first place but we felt that by maintaining a cordial relationship with her father, my daughter would have a healthier upbringing than if we were constantly feuding over custody and visitiation.  Not to mention, he hasn't exactly made positive parental choices over the years and I find it convenient (and reassuring) to be able to keep an eye and ear out during his time with her.  Thanks for your suggestions!  :)

We don't want a ceremony; we're looking to get married in the Atlanta/Fulton County courthouse.      I do understand that the fees are $61 to apply for the marriage license... but what will be next? Does that alone make us legally married? Will we need to find a pastor or a witness, or can any judge or public notary in the courthouse marry us? Also, how long would it take before we become legally married?      We're both of legal age, Georgia residents, and meet all of the requirements of getting married.
20090223100600AAyoI2P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need some mature advice.?	I'm asking this wondering if someone could give me some advice on if I'm maybe over reacting, or if I really should be upset about it.      I live with my boyfriend and in December, my boyfriend went away for a week to visit his best friend. Now his best friend is a drunk idiot who only wants to sleep with girls, so when my boyfriend left...I asked him not to do anything stupid. His best friend also has 3 roommates who are female.      He told me he would respect me and not do anything stupid.      Awesome. He left, I spent a week at home. We talked through text, he called me one night (drunk) just to say good night. I could tell he was drunk and asked him how drunk he was, he said he wasn't drunk.      After he got home from his trip I asked him how everything was and what he did. He told me everything was good and said they just hung out and had a good time.      Anyways, last night, his best friend added me on Facebook so I accepted, and I went through his profile pictures and to my amazement, there was a picture on there of my boyfriend with his head in between some girls cleavage.      So I asked him what was up with that, and he got really mad at me, and didn't feel bad at all for doing it even though I was hurt by this. He also said he did it to another girl that night too. (2 out of the 3 roommates) I told him how could I trust him now to go out with his friends if this is what he ends up doing? I asked him if he did anything else that night and he said that was all he did.      What I'm wondering is, am I over reacting? Should I not worry about my boyfriend getting drunk with his friends and then doing stupid things. He said he would respect me and I could tell when I showed him the picture that he was mad I found out. Should I drop it? Should I be worried?      Thanks.

20090223100853AAq1vc7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being Selfish about my friends and not considering my boyfriends feelings?	Me and my boyfriend have known each other almost all our lifes, we grow up together. But this past year we started to like each other and desided to go out. Now i have had a really bad relationship in the past (I moved WAY to fast) and so i dont want to do that again so i think things thro now and i tyr not to move to fast. I've told him this and he understands. Anyways, i have this friend and he's been my friend thro everything i even dated him once but that didnt work out and we desided to be friends, well now my boyfriend is being insanely jealous and doesnt like him at all! He once told me that i couldnt talk to him, but i said that we we'rent married and he has no right to tell me who i can and cant talk to. i talk him that James was one of my best friends and that i dont tell him who he cant hang out with, (because i dont like same of his friends) but i considered his feelings and didnt talk to james as much, I was wandering, am i being stupid? should i just stop talking to James?

20090223101002AA1zRAr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I live with my fiancee because I'm pregnant or wait to get married first?	I'm 31 weeks pregnant and my fiancee lives an hour and a half away from my parents' house which is where I live now. He has two part time jobs, but neither of these provide health insurance, so we are waiting to get married after I graduate from college (in May). He has just started the second part time job and will be making about 1300 a month. My parents have been more than happy to help me financially and physically take care of the baby when she gets here. The problem is my fiancee recently rented a trailer by where he lives and wants me to move in with him. I had made it clear to him that I did not want to move that far away because I don't know anyone in the area, and I don't drive very often. I also feel like I may need the support from home when the baby arrives. My parents are totally against me moving in with him right now because we aren't married, I'd be far away from everyone, and because with rent, utilities, insurance, and all the other bills we won't have much (if any) money for the baby. I do not want to make him have to drive to see his daughter, but I feel like he rented this trailer (without talking about it to me first) so that I would feel obligated to do things his way. He spent all the money we have been saving for the baby on rent and signed a six month lease. I would love to be with him, but I don't want to leave my family and friends behind or go bankrupt trying to do things before we are ready. I also don't want to lose the support of my parents by "shaking up" with him. I feel a little like i'm being torn between my fiancee and my parents. I want to do what is right for my daughter. I know she needs to see her father, but I also want to make sure she is well taken care of. Does anyone know how I can make everyone happier? Sorry this is so long. Thanks for any answers!

20090223101422AAgeOIk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Good way to flirt with a girl...?	So this girl that I'm friends with more or less told me that "I don't flirt with her enough". We were just talking about some guy that neither of us knew, and she mentioned that "at least he would probably flirt with me" and gave me a smirk.  It was a joking way of saying it, but I could tell she was hinting at something.      I do things like tease her and push her, and we always talk as if we're in a relationship (We call each other names like baby, sugar, love when we're nearby random people, and we act like we have children in front of people we don't know lol) but apparently that's not enough. Does anybody have any good "moves" to flirt with a girl?      Thanks for your answers! :)

20090426202044AANO2vM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she playing hard to get or not interested?	Hey everyone. Ive got a bit of a dilemma.      Theres this chick that i've know for a month and a half now, shes really sweet and nice. I've kinda been attracted to her from the get-go, but im not sure how she feels about me.       After I met her, Ive told her i liked her, and she played it down nonchalantly the first time. Said that she didn't have enough time to spend in a relationship, that her priorities were her education, friends etc. And in any case, she said she likes things to go slowly and doesn’t rush into anything. She likes things to simmer for a while and if anything happens it happens. So i acted fine and gave her space etc, talked to her like normal and treated her nicely.      Then i asked her out to lunch, she came and we seemed to click quite nicely. There was playful touching and lots of talk about each other’s personal details like family, hobbies, future ambitions and so on.    We went to the movies together a few nights ago. I wasn’t sure whether it was a date or not cos she has told me she hates putting labels on things. I didn’t make a move or anything, just walked her home. She gave me a playful jab as I was leaving.       I asked her out to lunch later this week and she said maybe. But when I asked her out before to other things, she always says maybe and it turns out to be a yes.      We text each other quite a lot at night. I always initiate the text convo as she has told me she doesn’t start txt convos  ever. When we text, we text for hours on end, so im pretty sure its not out of politeness but then again im not entirely sure. I text her being all cheesy and flirting, she always plays in down with a laugh or something similar. Her texting to me seems to show signs shes interested but then wouldn’t she have come out and told me shes interested? I mean she knows im interested so theres no chance of her being rejected or anything. All this makes me believe shes playing hard to get or that shes too nice to come out straight and say shes not interested.      Is she interested in a relationship with me, playing me, or even just wants to be friends? Should I be more firm in my approach? How do I take things further?

I asked him if he's coming today to the mall he told me he doesn't think he can make it, i told him you have to come[ in a joking way] he smiled then he told me i'll see.      he also raised and lowered his eyebrow toward me although i didn't know what he meant      i was in the car and he was on the sidewalk, i lowered the window and smiled and he smiled back and when the car pulled off, he looked back at it. i always smile at him and he smiles back.

20090223081430AAIlsdY	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What can I do about my abusive father? I dont know where else to turn.?	He is extremely abusive in every sense of the word. He has neglected me, and verbally and emotionally abused me for 10 years now. He has done the same to my mother, but he is also very physically abusive with her. I have tried the cops before, and he either left or they never responded. We live in California and we just want a way out. I have been told to get a retraining order, but at this point I don't think a piece of paper will keep him away when he goes into his psychotic rage. I'm scared of what he will do, and even once he is gone we have nowhere to go. I need help, I need to get myself and my family away from this.       P.S I have pictures of his physical abuse to her.    And due to him I have been diagnosed with bad depression & anxiety(plus insomnia & weight loss) im 5'7 and I weight 95lbs

Boy friend of 10 years moved out said that just because he was moving to get away from some problems with my daughter ( drugs) he is 49 I am 50... He said he loved me and just because he was living somewhere else didn't mean our relationship was over.The night before he moved he said he was second guessing himself on what he was doing...I went to his apt the first night and a woman was there hiding in the bed room.. I shut the bedroom door didn't say a word to her...said to him and you have been telling me all week that you love me and if this is the biggest mistake of your life could you come back home...Said a few more things then left ... when I got home he was here at my house 30 min later trying to tell me it was someone from work he needed someone to talk to.. I wouldn't believe him...  he is telling me he Loves me and wants to work it out between us and that there is no one and will be no one while we are trying to work it out...

20090223090330AAFB8ZC	Family & Relationships;Family	My controlling mother is driving me nuts?	I know I'm almost 24 yrs old and shouldn't not let her bother me. But she does. I do not currently live at home and I will be moving back for two months before I leave for graduate school. I have been dating this wonderful guy she's met only once and refuses to believe I'm dating. She even goes to the extreme of not allowing me to bring him up in conversation. She downright scares me sometimes because she comes off so strongly and opinionated       Anyway I was talking with her today (I try to only talk to her once a week because after talking to her my whole day usually gets shot to pieces). I was telling her she needs to allow my 19 yr old brother to make his own mistakes in college and that she should trust him in the way she raised him (meaning us). My brother is a good boy, and I try to act as the middle man between her and my mom (kinda wish I had an older sibling that could have done the same).       Well she began telling me that my brother and I were still under her jurisdiction and will be until we get married. That being 19 and 23 didn't mean anything because we're still her children. I told her I am old enough to think and decide for myself. But she said I am not old enough to know everything. She dumbfounds me sometimes I don't even know how to take it.       My mom is the type of person, who to me personally comes on to strongly. She's a Christian. A concervative one. I am also, but not to her extreme. She almost makes me not want to go to Church or believe in God because I used to feel he got me into trouble with my mother when I was younger (like when God told her where to find my diary).       This conversation upset me. I love them a lot. I want to honor and obey them, but I don't agree with her. And when I voice everything she just says its in the Bible (the thing about being under her authority till I am married).       Is there anyone out there that know what verses she is talking about? Also, how they apply to life now days anyway. Such as verses countering this control? Any kind of advice is appreciated. I've tried talking to her and making her listen .... no such luck. I'll always be wrong.
20090223091813AAQgVHf	Family & Relationships;Family	Cutting off my father?	My father manipulated me into telling me that he wasn't cheating but he was and this caused a rift in my relationship with my mother for years.  Had I known what he was doing, I would've told my mother right away.  I've been angry for 8 years and finally I opened up to him and everything seemed fine and I was going for a visit.      it seemed like he thought things were going to go back to normal (I'm going to call him "Papa" again and he started giving me advice on my life and he talked sh*t about my boyfriend about how he doesn't think he's responsible just because we want certain living conditions).  So I told him that I wasn't having any of it and he can't start acting like a godo father just like that.  Also, he's started telling me about his marital problems right away and I asked him not to and he won't respect it and told me to refund my ticket and if I can't "too bad it's your loss."      Like wtf?      I want to be civil with him because he's unfortunately my biological father but he's all "I'm your father respect me!"  He doesn't get that respect is earned and he DEMANDS it.  For 8 years he wasn't there and just 2 months ago I opened up..can't expect me to be all chummy.      The thing is, I'm doing this for me.  To finally fix my "daddy issues."  But he's not letting me.  My bf says this isn't going to help and it might be better to just cut him off?      Opinions anyone?

20090223093302AAa3j8o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When to call, am I moving too fast?	My brother is in the Army and about a month and a half ago I called him and he happened to put one of his soldier friends on the phone. Me and the guy really hit it off and we exchanged numbers. For the next couple weeks we texted and then graduated to phone calls. We really began liking each other. On Valentine's Day he asked me to be his woman and I said yes. We really like each other but he is on the other side of the country. He asked me to bake him a cake and I did and mailed it to him, Was that too much? He is sending me an army shirt that I have been wanting since my brother joined the army. Anyway, now that we're officially together when is it okay for me to call? Also, when he leaves his training he goes back to his home state which is in the mid west and I am on the East Coast. Am I wasting my time? Doing too much? And when is it ok for me to call? (He is in class 8-4 west coast time, plus he has PT (workout) at like 5 am) I dont want to be a pest and I know sometimes he gets tired. I really want this to work out. I have never seen him but he makes me sooo happy already. When I talk to him, my whole day get  better :)  He is coming to see me next month when they get their next four day and he even offered to pay half of my airfare out there.
20090223093843AAgcmFv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this girl acting like this?	Ok theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back at home and I think they seem really close. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I got the feeling that she liked me but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. So we agreed on being friends but she still avoids me. She stoped sitting next to me in class and 3 days later i got a text saying she needed a while, i guess before she would sit next to me again, so my question is will she end up sitting next to me and talking with me again and why is she acting like this if were goin be friends? Oh and i even caught her stairing at me a couple of times after this whole situation happened.

20090223095000AAVxe3y	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend is not the same and is leaving me out!!!?	My best friend found these 2 girls, and she always hangs out with them and leaves me out, cuz u see i don't like them so i didn't bother hanging out with them hoping my best friend will come with me. But she didn't so i went along and started hanging with them. But i hate them! So now all of a sudden if i ask my best friend if she can hang out with me she brings them along. And then leaves me out again. Cuz she has all of a sudden changed! And i can't relate to her. I wanna be friends. But even if i do try find other friends i don't like their personalities! Please help me!  Oh and ive told my friend but when ever i bring this up, she starts a HUGE fight!!! And then i have no-one!!
20090223095330AAB7hiO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i tell him how much i like him (even though he has a girlfriend)?	ok, i have a friend (lets call him fred) and i've known him for a few years. he asked me out a few years ago, but i said no and then we didn't really have much to do with each other for ages. then about 6 months ago, we started talking to him again. i sit next to him in form so we talk all the time and get along fantastically. we flirt with each other often and he's always messing around with my hair. i'm sure we would have been going out now but there's one problem: he has a girlfriend. they hardly ever talk to each other and go to different schools, but they've been going out for years, since they were, like, 6. They write to eachother at special occasions but he hardly ever mentions her. then, a couple of weeks ago, fred confessed he liked me and was considering dumping his girlfriend for me. i knew he was being genuine, but the next day he told me that he shouldn't have said it and carried on as if nothing had happened. WHAT SHOULD I DO??? i know it sounds cliché and whatever but i seriously have never felt like this about any one before. it seems as if he likes me too...but it doesn't look as if he's gonna dump his girlfriend. should i tell him how i feel?

20090223100055AAXTNrE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When do you call its love ?	I think about a girl 4,5 times everyday.Nothing romantic but just some random thoughts about her about what I said in past what I would say to her tommorow etc.      She works in my office and I look at her name 3 4 times a day in Instant Messenger.She sits in a different building of my firm.      How many times do you need to remember somebody on a day to call it a love.      Am I in love or its just a form of attraction thats natural?

20090223100907AAlTQpX	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom is playing games?	I am dealing with a number of emotions. My mother and I have a good relationship and we talk all of the time on the phone and I often go and visit her, she is only an hour away. She recently began offering to help. Alot of help. She said me and my husband should purchase a home, I will help you yadayaya.    I hate asking, but since she sounded like she really truly wanted to help I asked if she would help me with a down payment. All I asked her for was 8,000 dlls because I already had some money put away. She now is playing games and avoiding the topic. SHE does have the money and way more than that put away. This I know for sure, she does have money to help me.    I am so mad at her and myself for putting my self in this mess. I feel humiliated and betrayed. My own mother did not offer sincerely.    My point is why offer your help and then back out when your child wants some help.      By the way, I have never asked my parents for any help, and nor did I ever plan to, I was just taking her up on her offer.       Has anyone ever experienced this with their parents and why do parents do stuff like this?       I feel like I can't trust her anymore.
20090223100917AAJyPo4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I hit my girlfriend today?	I hit my girlfriend today... I feel like such **@%.       We were having an argument and she went too far. She made a comment along the lines of "your loser father couldn't keep a relationship together and you can't either!". When I was around 11, my parents got divorced and fought for custody. My dad wanted me and my brother because he genuinely loved us. My mom wanted us just to spite my dad. She won, and my dad kinda lost it over the decades.       This was too far for me. I had never, EVER hit a girl before, but it happened so fast I didn't even know I did it.       Basically, I cocked my fist back, and flew it straight into her nose. I thought it would be like the movies where she would get a little trickle of blood. It wasn't. Her nose EXPLODED. I think I must of broken a bunch of cartilege or something because blood shot out of both her nostrils, got all over me, got all over the floor. She staggered backwards, hit her head hard enough on the wall to leave a dent, and slumped down.       We were both stunned for about 10 seconds before she started crying hysterically and ran into my room and locked the door. So I went to wash my hands, and while I was in the bathroom I heard her run out of the house and take off in her car. That was about 5 hours ago so I guess she didn't go the cops or anything. So later I went home and broke down in tears.. My mom came in the room and when she heard about the story she got scared and said your moving with your auntie and uncle in bel air. I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and had dice in the mirror if anything i can say that this cab was rare but i thought "nah yo homes to bel air!" I pulled up to a house for about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cab yo homes smell ya later, looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to sit on my thrown as the prince of bel air.

I'm doing things to try and put the spark back with us, stuff we used to do when we started dating like having a lot of sex and pleasing her the best I can. Buying her some gifts, things I know she loves but it doesn't seem to be lasting long. She thinks I don't give her enough attention and I know I have done some stuff but I apologized for them. I feel like she expects me to be the perfect boyfriend. I don't want to lose her, what am I going to do?!

20090223004640AAS5aGQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am currently living a horrible life...?	I live in fear everyday. I have no courage or faith in myself. I have no one to turn to for help and I just can't seem to make any wise decisions. I wish for death everyday and my life is just unbearable. I am a whole world away from any family and still they don't know I feel this horrible however they probably know I am not in the best of health(mentally). I am here pretty much asking if anyone has any words of advice for someone at the end of their rope. There probably is nothing you can say to make me feel better. I feel like suicide is my best option. If you agree let me know and don't give me that whole "suicide is never necessary" talk. Too often I've heard that explanation and it has just lost all meaning.

20090223084122AAxS73n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does a person's sexual past (number of partners) have an influence on whether or not they will cheat?	My fiance and I have been together for 2 1/2 years, with a break of about 4 months somewhere in between, and we recently got engaged. I know nothing about his sexual past other than he's much more experienced than I am (he was my first) and that's about all I want to know. But last night we were talking and it came up that he's had a LOT of sex, and even had sex with 3 girls in one day during our break, which was 18 months ago (he was 24 at the time). I was repulsed and disgusted by this. I think he thought it was no big deal until I seemed so put off by it. He kept saying, "What, I'm a guy!" but I told him had the tables been turned and I went and slept with 3 guys in one day while we were broken up, he would think I was a whore. He got defensive and said he has always been safe, has never led anyone on, and has never cheated on a girlfriend. Anyway, I know the past is in the past and all that and I never have been one to judge, but it's just a side of him I never knew about. In this way, we are polar opposites. It makes me worried that he's more prone to cheat. Am I just being stupid to see this as a red flag, or would you be put off as well?

Thursday he told me he hated me and never wanted to speak to me again.. i was like uhm okay thats finee .   now he texted me saying "1980 - rehab" which is a song .. it wasnt our songg ..    Rehab- 1980      “Hey there, pretty little girl, with your  long brown sexy curls. Your a hottie, body tight; good God almighty-“ “Iight son, hold up, you need to slow your roll. You been talking for a while now, she ain't no hoe. She got class, style, pizzazz, and jazz, each smile, as matter of fact; she has me twisted, just like she did back then, when the game of gab could be played among friends. That's all it was about and now to represent, we talked last night around 10 and i told her, ‘Yo      CHORUS   listen up, cuz i love you lady. We go back, like 1980. Lord knows you're the one to change me. You love me cuz im so crazy. You'll see it'll be you and me always- always.'      I told her, ‘Look, i know a lot of folks around town probably been telling you that ‘damn, he just a crook.' I definitely done some things that i shouldn't be proud of, but we can do it by the book. We've know each other a long time. i know you're the strong woman with a strong mind, and that's what got me hooked. I got some crazy homies? What you talking bout, you got some crazy homies! Quit fronting and lolly gaggin'. We can have a baby daughter, maybe call her Maggie. We've known each other since the 9th grade. We make each other laugh,  best friends; let's do this the right way.'      CHORUS x2   ‘Listen up, cuz i love you lady. We go back, like 1980. Lord knows you're the one to change me. You love me cuz im so crazy. You'll see, it'll be you and me, always- always.'      I know im still crazy but i've changed a lot. And I've cleaned up a little, and you're still hot. But if i ain't the one, i hope you find  true love. And if not, i'm here when push comes to shove. Just know if you walk down that aisle with another dude to take those vows, how I'll react there's no tellin', might bust in the back of the church and start yelling.      CHORUS   'listen up, cuz i love you lady. We go back, like 1980. Lord knows you're the one to change me. You love me cuz im so crazy. You'll see, it'll be you and me, always- always.'                     what is he saying ?!!?!

20090223052746AAH0EOK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS would you date a guy with a BAD PAST?!?!?!?!>>>>>>>>>>>?	Well, I'm a 14 year old guy. A year ago I gave my life to God, and I really cleaned up. But before I did that, I was a pretty screwed up kid.   I used to cut, I looked at porn CONSTANTLY, I was suicidle, I didnt treat anyone with respect, I was rebelious, I looked at girls as objects instead of people, and I just pretty much hated everything.      I hate myself for my past, but in the one year that I've been saved, I did a total 180, and I know I'm not anywhere near perfect, but I know I've become a better person.      But I'm getting off track. Would you date a guy who had all of this in his past? I'm ashamed of my past, but I know I've been forgiven by God, and a bunch of other people I hurt, and I'm just trying to put it behind me. Now, I don't think of women innapropriatly, I try to be respectfull of my elders, I dont abuse my body, and I try to be as loving as I can.      Girls, if you met a really great guy with this past, would you date him?   Thanks guys, God bless.   :)
20090223084329AAEmStX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think divorce should be made more difficult to get?	I have been divorced before...a long time ago.  Now, I'm married to a wonderful and we're pushing 30 yrs.  The thing is, today, married people. NOT all, just some, don't try to work out their problems because if they don't like it, get a divorce.  I think before 2 people are allowed to divorce, they should have to see a counselor and at least try to work it out.  If all else fails then OK.  The times I would allow a divorce is in the case of infidelity, wife and child abuse.  I'm just curious as to what others think about this.  Please, I know if some of you have been divorced, it was for a good reason and I'm not asking this to put down or judge anyone.  All I want is input.  Do you think more marriages might survive if they had counseling before court?

20090223083537AAOkVra	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ask this guy out?	I've been friends with this guy Seth for a couple of years now (since 6th form) and have never seen him as anything more than a friend.  My friends would often tease me about him liking me, but I never thought it to be true.  Now I do and I think I feel the same way.      However he is shy and I can't imagine him making the first move; he is a proper gentleman.  So it therefore falls to me to ask him out, but I'm shy too and have never done this.  Girls, any tips?  Also do guys find it hot when a girl asks them out or just desperate?      I'm also going to America for a month in two weeks time and was wondering should I wait to ask him out or should I do it before I go?  It seems cruel to go out with him and then bugger off for a month, but at the same time I want to ask him out before I go.  What would be better?

I'm considering asking this boy out (something which I have never done) but I'm scared about what his answer will be.      We have been friends for 2 years now and he has been there for me when I needed him the most last summer.      Part of me thinks he will say yes (he is very protective over me; I seem to be the only girl, apart from his mother and sisters, he is comfortable with; and according to my friends he has always fancied me, but I can't help but doubt them), but the other half thinks he will say no.      He is very shy and VERY critical of himself, mostly because of his abusive dad.  He hasn't had a girlfriend.  He nearly did, but she a total b**** and treated him like rubbish, and so I'm worried that this has scarred him.  He is also a lot taller than me - 6ft8 and muscular whereas I'm 5ft3 and petite - and I don't know if this will have a influence on his decision.      He is sweet, placid, and despite his size, he never gets into fights with anyone, unless they hurt someone he cares about; he is a proper gentle giant.      I really like him, but am dreading asking him out because I am dreading his answer.      Am I nervous over nothing?  Based on what I've said, what do you think his answer will be?      Thanks.

20090223052641AAqTQtK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Post-relationship drama?	i recently broke up with my bf. he's turning 24 and i am turning 22. we dated for a little over a year, but we have the same friends since i basically introduced him to all of my friends. we were at the same party on friday where i met a guy, kissed him a bit and that was all.      somehow gossip is running around that i went home with this guy even though i didn't. my ex-bf is running around telling people that i was only trying to make him jealous, that he hooked up with a chick after the party and that he wasn't trying to make me jealous, that he was "doing what he felt like doing" etc. meanwhile, i'm just sitting in my house doing my hw, but obviously since we have the same friends, word came back to me that he was saying all these things about me. he's telling people that he cheated on me and all this other stuff. i'm really upset and agitated by the situation but just keep quiet about it because i hate drama. i've been distancing myself from him for awhile now but somehow things are still being said about me. i don't know how to make it stop. is he doing all this to spite me or is he doing it because he still cares and it trying to make himself feel better?

He used to go to my school 3 years ago...I'm now 20 years old, and back in October he got in touch with me online...We chatted a lot on MSN and I really warmed up to him...Then we started meeting up for quick chats at nighttime...Eventually we started going places together and even met each other's families...      We kissed and hugged a lot and he made me feel safe and happy for the first time in ages!!!      But after only four weeks his life began to get busier and he started having less and less time for me...I suppose because of this I lost myself and became a bit clingy and demanding...I regret that now :(      Well, one day he texted me to tell me he needed space while he sorted his life out...He said we would still be friends and that he wasn't leaving me forever!      But then I heard that he had gotten back with one of his exes!!! In a moment of anger I deleted him from Facebook and we haven't spoken in six weeks.      It is his birthday today...I sent him a message wishing him a happy one...He hasn't replied and I'm upset because he is leaving the country next week for 8 months!!! I'm scared I won't even get to say goodbye or give him a hug :(      He's going out with a bunch of friends this weekend...I'm so upset that I won't be going with him as he hasn't invited me :(      What do I do? I don't want to seem desperate but I want to try something as I'd rather regret what I did than regret what I didn't...Help! I'm so lost :(

I know it was a while go but I feel awkward in a bad way when I run in to him. He can't stand me and I can't stand him. To top it all off, he's a player (I found this out on my own) and tells her the same lines and does the same gestures he did with me. I talked to my sister about this and she doesn't have a care in the world that #1; he's a player and #2; I'm bothered by this relationship. I know I can't control who she loves, but it bothers me to the point, I wont come around if he comes to family dinners and such. I feel that uncomfortable. What do I do?  She's 19 and he's a yr ahead of me; 26. (not saying it's a huge deal with the age thing) but my gosh, what a player he is and tells her every thing she wants to hear. He's arrogant too.

Hi Folks,      My 80yr old mother lives with us, I love her, and is no bother apart from the stairs.      A stair lift thing cannot be fitted, apparantly, as it goes in a "U" shape around corners.   So much for Stanna & Acorn then.   The have not found a way of going around corners.      What abou a lift, then ?   I could take a bedroom out, lose a corner of the dining room, put the motor room in the loft.      I do not wish to have Mother in a converted downstairs bedroom, nor really struggle to get up to the bathroom.   There is a downstairs loo, though, but.      I am a volunteer for the local water mill, where we made a cavity, and they  installed a lift for the disabled to nip up to the top.   I am told this is possible in an ordinary house      Well the "stair-lift" folks can't  !      I am being a bit OTT, but what about an external bubble lift on the back wall ?      Any sensible ideas ?      Bob

Ok, well, I speak fluent French, because I took it all through high school and continued learning it on my own through college and on my own... My mom's whole side of the family is French, and I wanted to communicate with the French-speakers in our family, and it's also just something I love. Well, I'm 25, and my fiance, Patrick, is 26, and he just thinks that my French is like... the hottest thing ever... I don't really get why though?? I mean, I know French is a romance language, but he LOVES it... Everytime I get off the phone after talking to my relatives in French, I... get lucky... haha. He's said things like, "Everytime you speak French, I just wanna... bone you..." haha. I don't get why it's such a turn on for him? Any clue why? Guys? Or girls?

He is now getting on my nerves, I notice all the worse things about his personality. He is very arrogant about his work and today he went on and on about how the tv were stealing his ideas. He doesn't have anything nice to say to me and mostly just ignores me and kisses up to the other girls in the class. When I am having a one on one with the teacher he interrupts and changes the subject so my tutor ends up talking to him instead. And he openly talks about us having sex in front on his mates and me which he knows I don't like. How can I deal with this? Am I getting out of order or can we make it better? :)_ thanks guys !!!

20090223103754AAWO8TF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can make a fresh start and escape my unhappy past?	In the past I was I was a real mess of a person and did a lot of things I regret. I dropped out of my post-graduate degree, messed up my career, got into a lot of debt, dabbled in drugs and gained 74lbs. Worst of all I cheated on my partner a few times. I was in a really bad place and was treated for depression I think I thought that these almost random people I imagined I was in love with could save me from myself and cure me. Of course each encounter only brought me pain and I have not cheated on my partner for 4 years now. I am not sure if they ever suspected and I have not told them. I believe my partner loves me and even though we have been through some hard times together and nearly broke up a few times things are now really great between us now that I have grown up somewhat.    I have just finished paying my debt back off and would love to make a fresh start in life but all the bad things I done, all my failings and especially the fact that I cheated on my partner keep coming back to haunt me, I just can't escape from all my unhappy memories.      What can I do to move past all that and start afresh?         P.S. I could never tell my partner about my cheating, it would only cause pain all round.
20090223084334AAAcIUt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you make of what he said? I am so confused.?	i have a very complicated relationship w/a guy for over a year now. i can't commit fully and he has issues of his own. He called me last night and we talked for over 3 hours. At one point in the conversation he said "I love you, have I told you lately that I love you" after that he mentioned how lately he knows when he texts me or responds to my text that he is cold and that he could take the extra few seconds to add something sweet.       That my messages touch his heart and motivate his day and it makes him feel bad that he doesn't return with the same kindness but that he is holding back so he doesn't confuse me or himself further. Than he asked "should I say those things to you I mean for some reason it makes me feel uncomfortable I do feel those nice sweet things but now for some reason feel uncomfortable to say them...do you think i should say them?"       I told him that he should do whatever makes him feel comfortable. I am so confused as to what he meant and why he would say this. I tried to ask but he didn't really want to get into it further and said "well dont you understand what I am trying to say?"....what do you make of what he said to me??

20090223104551AACfYkR	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I get my parents to say no?	Odd question, yes, so here are more details:      I am the oldest sibling and have one younger brother.  My parents are divorced and have been for almost 20 years.  My brother will be 21 in June and I am 25.   I am living on my own, about to get married, and have been taking care of myself, for the most part, since I left for college at 18.      My brother has been living with/off of my parents with a 6 month break to live in Miami and do odd jobs.  He's been to college for a little while, but didn't do as well as he should have and was bored and thus left.  He's gotten into all kinds of "bad things" and has no concept of money, saving, or independence.      He's living with my father now, with no job, no desire to get one, etc... (and really, it's hard to blame him in some ways...free is nice!).  However, I'm worried about him never learning how to fend for himself.      How can I get my parents to stop giving him an "out" when he doesn't like life (or it gets "too hard")?      I know I should just let it go, but he's my baby brother and I feel obligated to give it one last ditch effort before getting married and moving on into my new family.      Thanks everyone!
20090223063106AAcXYPu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he ignoring me because I told him I was a bit upset at him?(It's a little long, but please help!)?	The guy I've been dating did a few small things that upset me this weekend when he met my mother and something else. I didn't say anything until he asked me if I was angry with him yesterday, so I confessed that "I wasn't his biggest fan today." He begged to know why and I told him I didn't want to talk about it over texting and that I would tell him when he came over Monday (today.) This morning, he called and again wanted to know. I told him I was on my way to work and I would again tell him when he came over. He was texting me very upset and asking if it was important and I kept assuring him it wasn't a big deal, just something I wanted to say. He wouldn't drop it, so I finally told him. It's been an hour, and he has yet to text me back.      Granted, he just got into work, so he might be busy. But do you think he might be ignoring me on purpose because I upset him? I didn't think what I said was all that bad. If you need to know the story, he was supposed to come over Saturday to hang out with my mother and sister, who he hadn't met yet (my sister). We made plans the night before, and then 7 pm Saturday night, only after I asked, did he say he wasn't coming. Obviously, after telling my mother and sister all day that he was coming, I felt incredibly stupid. I told him that I felt kinda stupid in front of my family when he didn't let me know until last minute he wasn't coming.      I was trying to be nice about it and assure him that it wasn't something I'd end things with him for, but he did insist on knowing why I was upset, so I was only being honest. Is this something that would have really hurt him enough to ignore me?

20090223044735AAZhxeY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Man of the house?????????????	I recently read another forum about a guy who was laid off from his job and is now only working part time while his live in girlfriend worked full time and one woman responded with this remark.      "yo, unless he's payin the bills and supportin his family he's not the man of the house."      How do you guys feel about this?  We do live in the world today where some women make more than men.  Some women are the breadwinners in a house but does that make them the men of the house?  Or was this woman basically saying she has no or littel respect for a man who either can't find a full time job or she wants / expects a man to support her?      Fellas, what's your take on this?  Would you want to be with a woman who shared these views?  Granted, the economy is in the toilet right now and a ton of people are out of work but if the only thing this guy could find was a part time job should women now dump on him because of it?

20090223093457AAu4lT9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys and promise rings.......?	I can't understand why any guy would want to give his girlfriend a promise ring. Most guys I've ever met are all out for sex, (except the few unattractive ones who are very willing to wait because they know they're not going to get any anyway.) I've never been the type of girl to sleep around, but I'm wondering why a guy would be so willing to produce this ring? We all know that most guys have stronger urges than women to make love, so why would they jeopardise their chances by giving their girlfriend this ring if theres a possiblility that she'd "give in" without being pressurised? I don't really get it.

20090223080904AA6YIf5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is an ex aware that he is following you around?	My ex boyfriend of many years has been driving by my apartments and jobs (there have been a few of both) over the last couple years and driving to match my schedule and leaning over to look at me.      Not enough for me to be scared but enough for me to notice. And enough not to be coincidental although it would be easier to think so. He knows that I know he does this. I ignore and then tried to talk to him about it - which he denies - this is the first time we have "really" seen each other since we broke up. He has a new family.      Does he realize he is doing this? What could he possibly want me to think about this?

20090223081239AApBN84	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	MEN - please, tell me...?	This question might sound a little stupid, BUT, I just want to see it from a man's point of view.        Do you get feelings for a woman after having sex with her?  Like us women, who tend to get feelings for a guy if we sleep with them. Or is just like a "wham bam, thank you ma'm" kind of thing?        Can you just sleep with a woman and catch no type of feelings for her?   Please, tell me.  This should be interesting :)
20090223045721AAaXIvg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is asking my girlfriend to try harder at school so she can get into uni something that i should do?	We both want to go to university very badly but she isn't trying as hard as i know she should.      I don't think she's really realized that this is the big final year and there's a lot counting on it.    I know she can repeat but it would be a small tragedy if she had to.      Will this push her away from me? I'm only doing it because I'm worried for her but i don't want her to think I'm bossy.
20090223072057AAQCfM3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I sent a very flirty message to my boss by mistake!?	I was chatting with this guy I met all week; and I text messaged him a message saying "U r definitely a big temptation". But instead of replying to the the guy's number, I replied to my boss' number. I realized what I did immediately after pressing "Send" and I text messaged my boss again saying "sorry, wrong recipient" and a second message saying "sorry. u obviously received this message by mistake". My boss and I are really cool; so I was OK with him receiving the message. It was like a big joke. But his wife saw it! And now I am so embarrassed! He says she laughed also, but before I sent the sorry reply, she was not laughing... How do I face her when I see her? My boss can't stop laughing at the thing but I am so embarrassed that he finds out that I am a flirt! Worst, the message was not to my boyfriend and he figured that out too!!! How would you deal with that situation?

20090223054352AAZYk9X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to make boyfriend really jealous & wake up?	Well, I was upset at the end of the week, and I was having some anxiety issues over something that had happened in my class, however it was the same type of issue that had gone on for some time because I freak out about little things. I know it's ridiculous, but I still feel like my boyfriend shoud be here for me, yet all he says is ..."take anxiety medication." And it pisses me off so bad, and he's sick right now but he hasn't been here for me at all for the past 3 days, he's been seeping, and acting as though he doesn't even care. But the thing is, if I ever told him I wanted to break up he woud make me feel so bad for him that I would never be able to. Plus, I woudn't have the ability to anyway because I love him. And he's grown ammune to me saying "we need to break up" lol. So, I just wanted to know a way to make him wake up and realize that he needs to be here for me or i'm going to go. Any suggestions?

She kept looking over at me and on the way out, she glared at me and smiled, before flicking her hair back.      So I decided to walk her out and have a quick 3 minute conversation with her.  That's our first convo together.  I see her again this evening.  I am thinking about asking her to dinner on Friday night(only day I'm available).  Is it too early?  Should I talk to her a little more today and then ask her out in a few more days?

20090223072634AAlzrbI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Women........... tough question concerning my friend, his late wife, and her sister!?	Basically, here is the situation:   My buddy, whom I've known for more than 10 yrs, lost his wife in an accident about 8 months ago. She was my friend as well, and she left a young daughter also ( she was 32). Her and her sister were best friends, looked the same, talked the same , 2yrs apart. She is an awesome girl. Last week, they told everyone that cared about them that they were involved, in love, and were getting engaged. From my point of view, even though it's been only a week, they seem to care deeply about one another, and I say go for it.   Obviously, there is that little issue that is becoming a big issue from either side of the family. "That is your dead wife's sister." "you are confused because she reminds you of your late wife", "you are disrespecting your late wife", and on and on..........   I understand the questions, and I think that they are mostly emotion based.      What is your take on the situation? Do you have any hangups if this were to happen in your family? Is it too damn early?      Thanks for the feedback!

20090223091700AAAOqmS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(10 points for best answer) Wow is my girlfriend pregnant?	Alright shes 16 we have been dating for a month now, we been having sex for lets say three weeks, will whatever weekend the Superbowl was. And since then we have done it tons of times.      Anyway shes on birth control so we don't use condoms, and I pull out when I'm ready to go anyway. I am confident I have never went in her, but often times we go right back at it after were done, without cleaning up or anyway I guess haha.      She has always been paranoid about getting pregnant but we get to the point where she just wants it so bad she doesn't even think about it, shes just really wants to make sure that I don't go in her.      So anyway yesterday was quite weird, everything was going fine and I was on top of her and we were just kissing and holding each other. Then she felt discomfort and I moved off her, and shes like omg I feel like I have a baby inside me or something. And I'm like what... she then looked at me and we kind of changed the subject.      She then asked me hey if I was to get pregnant your over 18 you could take me to get an abortion right. And I'm like I think so, I don't really know though why. And she didn't answer the why part, and shes like well then my mom would never know and she smiled and kissed me.      So today at school she texted me during class. Complaining about pains in her stomach like cramps, and I asked if it happens a lot she says no. So I was telling her I hope she feels better, try to take it easy. And then she flat out said ok if I don't get my period soon I'm taking a pregnancy test. And I'm like ok...      Our last conversation she was asking if I would wear condoms, and I told her I would so. This is where we are, I honestly think shes concerned about being pregnant. It just so happens that her mom is pregnant right now so she spends a lot of time looking after her and learning about it. So she would know the early stages...      Are these sings can someone please help me out, sorry for the length but I'm in a bad place here. First I don't want to get her pregnant it would mess up our lives. And second if she is I really don't want her to get abortion. Although I might have to, because its her decision.

A single guy at work emailed me after I recently ended a relationship and said "I really like you, you're unlike anyone I've ever met" in a 300 word email on the subject.  That was a month ago. He's still friendly and makes an effort to talk to me, but he hasn't asked me out.  What the heck is going on?        I'm very positive and receptive to him but don't drool over him or anything (it is work).  What do you think he's thinking? please note: I refuse to ask a guy out (if they like me, they can ask me).

20090223105252AA8GUrK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do i do about Mrs. Ogdijeblal?	My 6th hour class is taught by a lady named Mrs. Ogdijiblal. She is odd because sometimes shes nice to me and other times shes such a shaved  couch to me. I could literally just talk to someone and shell be all like "calm down and breathe" Plus if you miss one day of school while doing a project she makes you do the whole thing over by yourself,even if you did all the work on the other projects and your partner is being a lazy fish sucker. What do i do to get her to leave me alone? Also, theres this girl with skin as white as snow and jet black hair. She is so ugly and mean i die a little every time i see her and she constantly death glares at me all the time. I seriously dont even know what i did to her. Its not my fault her boyfriend and her are ugly twins! She thinks i like her boyfriend but the truth is, hes an ugly 17 yr old balding shower bag, and i wish they would leave me alone!
20090223045234AAxYDyt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do women go for in a guy?	Do girls like mature looking men over young looking baby faced guys? Is it attitude....like how much confidence you have over looks and handsome features? I just asked this question because my twin brother gets alot more attention from girls than me. We would be standing in a que in Tesco...and I just notice he gets checked out alot. I often get ignored...or some po faced look from girls. Although we are twins he does look slightely older and more 'rugged'...i.e longer manly face compared to my more oval younger looking baby face. When we are in female company he seems to attract alot more attention...I wonder if this is possibly due to him having slept with a number of girls.......I'm still a virgin (that was hard to admit)....and they sense this!! I just don't know......but it gets a bit annoying and gets me down a bit because there has always been a bit of twin rivalry!!
20090223075713AAq0Arq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	So there's this girl in my class i've had a crush on for a while, and I think she likes me, but I'm not sure so I thought I could get some advice here.   I sit in front of her in French class, and every class me and her start talking, and we talk so much tot he point that the teacher sometimes changes the seats of one of us. We also tend to hold hands a lot, link arms and she even pretends that I'm her boyfriend, and it's so convincing that some of our teachers and friends thought we really were going out. We're also really close when it comes to the "touch barrier", I mean, I sometimes hold her from her waist against me, I kiss her in the cheek all then time, I hug her a lot also, and she likes to put her head on my shoulder in class. She also likes to give me these little bites, and when I turned 17, which was like 3 days ago she said she would give me a kiss as a present, and that I could pick the place. And I also happen to know that she thinks I'm the 2nd best looking guy in my class, 'cause she said it to a friend of mine. And I don't think she's being a flirt, because I have never seen her do anything even remotely close to the things we do with other guys.   The reason why I'm confused is that she once told in class to some of us that she only dates guys that are like, 18 or 19 years old (she didn't say it out of the blue, she said it because we were talking about stuff like that), and because I also think she is kinda out of my league ( it's not like I'm ugly, I mean I have blonde hair and blue eyes, but she is just absolutely beautiful). So, what do you think, does she like me?      BTW, I'm 17 and she is gonna be 18 in a month.
20090223055432AAg9U3h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Too sad a story, to be able to love everyone yet not to be "In Love" with just one?	I have this problem, I can love anybody, but I can never be "In love" with anybody. too much past hurts, too many ghost's, too many insecurities. its the burden of being a victim of childhood abuse.      But that said I have a compassionate heart and a love for people, I can guide but never be committed, don't get me wrong I would love to have that someone special, to hold and care for but maybe its not for me?      any thoughts on this one.

20090223064717AAXyUN5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my bf taking advantage of me?	My partner isn't working, he's on a benefit and seems as tho he's comfortable with that sort of lifestyle.  We're in a long distance relationship at the moment, he keeps on at me to get him a ticket to come over to where i am...  and i'm trying to bide as much time as i can so's to see just how serious he is about our relationship and how much he'd do to get himself here.  He tells me he's saving and all that but, i know what it's like to be on a benefit and saving don't come easy esp after paying rent and the other weekly committments the money just doesn't stretch too far.  I love him to death and want more than anything for him to be here with me but, like i say i want to see how far he'd go to get here....   Please, all answers considered.  Cheers...

20090223085932AAuM2lL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do if you discovered the person you started dating was really bad in bed?	A question to both men and women, straight and gays.      If you started dating a person, enjoyed their company, and liked them- but discovered they were a total dud in bed- what would you do?      If your boyfriend/partner was a male, had a very small penis, and/or was a premature ejaculator, and/or was just lousy as sex, wouldn't give oral,what would you do?      And if your girlfriend/partner was female, just lay there like a pile of laundry, was as dry as hay, didn't reciprocate in oral, got sore and tired after only a few minutes, and was an awful lover, how would you react?      Sometimes you can 'train' a poor lover into being a good one, but not always- Is sexual incompatibility a valid reason for deciding to end a relationship- OR would you live with it, and feel sex just isn't that important to worry about?
20090223104545AAuM3k9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I don't know what to do anymore!?	Hi all,      I am a 14-year-old girl named Jean in college.  Yes, I know that's young, but please don't comment on it.      This will be kind of long, but please bear with me and read.      So, I'm taking an online organic chemistry class.  It is really difficult for me, especially since this online class has no lecture, etc., only tests and the textbook.  I recently took the midterm exam, and got 32/100.  The highest score was 100/100 and class average was 60/100.  I obviously did worse than everyone else.      Anyway, to prepare for this test, I studied hard.  I mean really hard: I solved all the textbook questions, read it thoroughly, did all the quizzes (100% accuracy), past midterm questions (also 100% accuracy), and the textbook student site.  But I took the test and bombed it.      Now my older brother has always been better than me in everything except violin and fencing; he's smarter than me too.  My mother always compares me to him and says things like "your brother always got 100% on all his tests and he was younger than you" and "your brother Alex was already in medical school at your age" and stuff like that.  She swears a lot and any time I get a B or lower on anything, even a practice exam, I will hear about how stupid, idiotic, worthless, etc. I am for literally a week straight every day.  I stay home all day, too, so that doesn't help.  She never does it when my family are around, so they and other people all think my mother is so nice and tell me how lucky I am.  I almost throw up when I hear that.      I was homeschooled by my mother until high school, and during that whole period of time at home, she would yell at me every day about anything I did.  I wasn't holding that paper when I wrote, my hair was too long, why couldn't I understand that bit of trig at first try, etc., etc.  She would throw all sorts of stuff at me at home (once she threw a pencil at me and the sharp lead point got in my palm so we had to go to the doctor's office to get it out, where she said that I had been playing around and got it in my hand by accident), hit and kick me, verbally abuse, hit me with belts, etc.  And I always have to hear from family and friends about how nice my mother is.  She acts super-nice in public.  Even my dad and brother are fooled.      My mother has always favored my brother over me.  He never has to do anything, and he has never been scolded once (I know because he stays at school all day and when he comes home I'm always there).  He gets anything he wants and my mother always brags about him to other people.  Once when I was a toddler he had a tantrum about his computer and threw a large book to the ground.  Our rooms are next to each other and I knocked on his door and asked if he was ok.  He slammed the door open (yes, it's possible) and there was this weird light in his eyes and he broke my wrist.  Of course I went to the doctor and had to get a cast.  From then on, even now, my wrist is weaker than my other.  For anything bad he does, I get blamed for it.  For example, if he does badly on a test, I get shouted at for keeping my radio to loud and thus interrupting his studying.  (Note that I don't have a radio.  Only my brother has one. When I protest and say I don't have a radio, my mother yells at me for talking back and I get grounded for a week while my brother gets some new present like an ipod or something.)      It's worse than it sounds and I can't really explain everything.  People have said I'm very pretty, cute, and so smart with the whitest milky skin and shiny brown hair but my self-esteem has gone down and I feel really bad.  I was suicidal but now I'm just depressed.  What should I do?  I'm tired of holding it all in and not being able to cry.  My dog and violin are my only comfort.      Thank you for reading this long question, and I would really appreciate if you replied.      Thank you again.

When I asked him he said that different scenses are repeated to him during the day and that when he focuses too much and thinks deeply, he kinna see allmost real stuff. He said that it's been happening to him since he was 12 years old. is that normal? is he going crazy or might have schezophrenia??      He talks to himself in a very soft voice, i can bearly distinguish what he's saying. and he even reacts by moving his hand sometimes. it's like hallucination or if someone is posessed. Should he say a psychiatrist??

20090223064953AAQBL0T	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why would my mom be so hard to accept my friend and my relationship?	So, I have this new friend.....   We have never actually physically met (meaning in person)...we met through texting (he is my cousin's friend, and he "randomly" got my number from my cousin's cell phone and we have been texting ever since) And when my mom found out that I have been texting a guy who is 3 years older than me  (I'm 14 and he is 17) she flipped out, and started talking about being "safe" (as in sex) and how that's all guys think about and stuff like that (he has a girlfriend already and I am NOT interested in him) and then she took my phone and started going through our messages from that day (and that day was full of weird jokes and quirky things that could be taken as flirting if you didn't know what we were really talking about) and she was all like "the way you two talk to each other is almost like you're together or something" and I was like "Ewww nooo!!! We are JUST FRIENDS! nothing more! and it will NEVER happen!!" but she still doesn't believe me, and whenever I laugh a lot/blush at what he said, or jump to my phone w/e it vibrates, she clears her throat or looks at me funny, and says “are you talking to that boy again?”  And then I have to pretend it was one of my girl friends.    Last night,  I was reading a midsummer’s night dream, and then he texted me saying that he was reading Romeo & Juliet (totally oblivious to what I was reading [[meaning he didn’t know I was reading it]]), and then I quoted the “these violent nights have violent ends” quote and we started quoting different parts from Romeo and Juliet, and when I was looking for my copy of it in my living room from reading it the other day, my mom asked what I was looking for and I told her I was looking for Romeo and Juliet so I could find an exact quote to send to one of my friends, she was like “what friend?” and got all snoopy and freaked out when she saw that he and I were quoting Shakespeare.       I just don’t understand why she can’t accept the fact that I have a friend who is a guy.  Like it’s not that uncommon for girls and guys to be friends, but she makes it seem like it’s the biggest deal in the word. Like it’s not like we’re constantly flirting…we never do…but she just makes the biggest deal of the smallest things….like him helping me with my science homework/help me study for tests.      Any one know what her problem with us is?
20090223074346AAFwLjk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this signs of disinterest from a girl ?	I went to a bar club last night cos it was my friend's birthday. Keep in mind this club is over 21's & i'm 18yrs old. Anyways i'm usually shy with girls but decided to give it a go. I saw these 2 girls sitting down who knew my mate so i introduced myself to them. Sometime later when i went to speak to them about all sorts, age occupation and at times i felt they weren't interested. When i said i was 18 they thought aww i'm a baby & cute As time went on, i felt it was me trying to continue the conversation, so they both went to dance. (At least i tried). Later on as we passed to go toilets, 1 of them playfully poked me on the chest & said "hey there you are, you alright ?" I said i'm fine & had to go - they both looked surprised...   What do you think ?

20090223063306AAbt3lS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's two years younger, and he's shy?	He's younger than me by two years [and he acts really mature for his age] but when he found out i was almost 16 his eyes got big, he half laughed then he looked down really quickly..   When he's talking to me his eyes stare in mine like..no one i've ever talked to before..   He's kinda shy, until you get him talking...   I met him about two or three months ago..   And he cut himself on accident, recently, and he kept coming up to me showing me the progress of his finger, if it was still bleeding..   and then i decided to pick on him by saying "You think there's gunna be a scar?" and he started laughing and said "I think i'll get a scar." and while we were talking his dad turned around, looked at his son and i, shook his head and started laughing.   Also, i had my teeth cut out before one of our 'big games' and he was making sure i was well enough to play the bb game. It was really sweet,..   and when i'm talking to him or next to him, one of his friends will come up and embarass him. [like smacking him in the butt. saying "wooooo [then his name] ....etc etc] then he'll look at me and his face gets really red...   Recently one of my friends was sitting next to me, she left and went to the bathroom..and he was sitting behind us, then he looks at me and says "I might steal her seat" like 5 minutes after she left, and he sat there..and One time i smiled at him and said hi [just being friendly, i do that to everyone] and he smiled really big and looked down..    Also, i DO NOT like him in that way, although, he is kinda cute..but thats besides the point.....i'm just wondering if he likes me.   soo, what do ya'll think?

I mean, I like him. He's gentlemanly, won't let me pay if I take him out. We seem to have a lot in common. Anyway, here's a list of things that kind of...bother me.      I'm becoming reluctant to hang out with him, because he's constantly trying to kiss me. A few times is ok, but if we're at the movies, if we're on a date, or if we're just hanging out talking, it's like he *needs* to be kissing me every 5 minutes. We've been dating about 2 weeks now.      We were just talking, and we were like 2 or 3 feet apart, and he asks why I'm so far away. Literally 90% of the time, he wants his arms around me. Which is nice...in moderation.      When he does start kissing me, if I gently push him to break the kiss, he sometimes doesn't respond.      He said he planned to see me today. But this is how he asked: "I'll be outside your house at 10:30. Ok?" I really didn't like that, and just canceled on him because I have much studying to do. Anyway, what do you think?
20090223110246AA0y34g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do?I am giving him space. Everyone agreed to even his own mom who loves me so much. How much?	time though??      My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.

20090223093056AAamvNo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long should you wait before sleeping with someone?	Ok, so the double standard in our society is that if a guy sleeps with a girl the first night, he is "the man".  In the same situation, the girl is "a ho".     If a guy sleeps with hundreds of women, he's "the man".  A girl that sleeps with a bunch of guys, is "a ho".  That's the way it is.      So if a guy and a girl meet and like each other, how long should they wait before having sex?  So that the girl is still respectable, and the guy hasn't "given up" on trying to get some and moved along.        What is a good grace period?

I've notice nowadays more african american men are straying away from dating the african american women. i hear all types of stories that we are too independent, strong willed, or just too much for them. What is it that makes the african american women so unattractive to you all?       For me, I love african american men and believe they should give us women a little time and not be so quick to judge us just based off the type of females that you men seem to attract.
20090223073734AAH1eNY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for long distance relationships, personal experience only.?	So first off gonna graduate soon hopefully get a job and a palce and we are gonna move in together so yay. Okay now my question, My girlfriend and i have been talking about salsa dancing she is hispanic and so am i and we talked about how we would go dancing. We have talked obviously that i dont mind her going to clubs with her girlfriends but i didnt ask her if she would with her guy friends. Personally i find dancing to be an intimate thing wether its a ballroom dance or 'grinding'. I'm very uncomfortable with it but i dunno how to start conversation without coming off like i dont trust her cause really i do but like i mentioned to me dancing is an intimate thing that i want me and her to do not for her to go around dancing with her guy friends. So how would you start the conversation? Am i right that dancing is an intimate thing and that im not being possessive? Any personal exsperience, viewpoints, or answers are more than welcomed. Best answer goes to whoever can offer good advice on all standpoints
20090223090256AA0gN3j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will she forget about me (please help i havent gotten many responses)?	Ive been dating this girl for a couple months now. I really like her and she says she really likes me, that she likes how things are going with me, and that she's lucky I didnt give up on her when I could have (ive liked her for awhile). Coming off a romantic valentines day evening at the beach we have been less communicative this week. It made me kind of come off as needy, but she said she didnt get sick of me but she has just been really busy. I decided to back off and give her space and haven't spoken to her in 2 days now. I'm afraid she'll forget about me or something, but dont want to be clingy.      Do you think she's just been busy like she says? Am I at risk of her forgetting about me and how I make her feel? Its like I want to give her space, but I'm paranoid that I'm doing damage to what we have going (which seemed really good). What should I do?

20090223080341AAM44k9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he mean it, or did he feel forced?	Ive only been with my boyfriend for almost 5 months.   That's a short amount of time, but we both knew from the start that our feelings for each other were strong.  He helped me to get over such a big, painful part of my past, and the minute i saw him smile, i almost instantly forgot about my pain.      He found a note i wrote him that i wasn't planning on giving him, it told him i loved him, and how much i cared. i was scared to tell him these things, and hadn't planned on it. However what hurt me was the silence i received after he folded the note and put it in his pocket.        We were arguing about two weeks after this, and this situation got brought to the table. I told him that he could tell me if he wasn't ready, but the silence really hurt me. So he told me face to face that he wasn't ready.      Later that night everything was good. we were hugging and kissing, and he was being INCREDIBLY sweet [he really always is] but it was different, he was being sweeter than he has ever been

20090223094131AAJBCq0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friend who is 13 had sex with "some guy she met a hotel"?	My friend has always been kind of a ****. And I mean she told me that it was "no big deal" (it was her first time too), and then decided that she no longer liked the guy she did so she dumped him and made out with some other guy. I don't know what to say to her to convince her that what she did was not only MORE than "no big deal" but wrong. And its weird because literally 2 weeks ago we were watching disney movies on youtube. I don't know what happened to my friend, and I'm used to just being annoyed for flirting with guys who are wayyy older than her but her "just doing some guy on a golf course" was going too far. What are other peoples' thoughts on this?
20090223091608AAN1mf3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best sign for a Gemini woman? Gemini woman and Virgo man is this good?	Hi am a Gemini woman and I recently came out of a bad break up with an Sagittarius after 2 years, I loved him dearly but after the 1st year it just seemed like all the passion was gone and we started to slowly break away from each other, and argue for any little thing, my girlfriend is very into signs and she believes that Sagittarius wasn’t the right match for me…Well it’s been 4 months now that we have broken up, and I now am dating a Virgo, we’ve been dating for 1 month, and already we seem to disagree on everything, but the passion between us both is strong, but other than that I find him to be a bore… does anyone know what’s a good match for a Gemini female? I like my Virgo guy cause he’s sweet, but it seems he’s to boring and has so many rules!!

I texted him yesterday just saying "hey-how is your day going" and he has not responded.  How long should I wait before I text again?

20090223104628AAan8A4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which guy do i choose?	Well, theses two guys asked me out and both are really good friends, but i like this other boy, who i have no chance with.      one of them is really sweet and cute, but it would be a long distance relationship.      another is a complete flirt normally, but can be a really sensitive guy once you get to know him. The problem with him is he lives in california, and although he has one parent he can stay with here, if i say no, he says he's going back.      the guy i like is my age and lives locally. He can be a complete git and isn't my normal type. I went out with him about a year and a half ago, but we broke up. I still like him, but don't think i have another chance.    I'm not sure whether to try with one of the other two whilst is still like HIM.

20090223092651AAkFvZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Good way to flirt with a girl...?	So this girl that I'm friends with more or less told me that "I don't flirt with her enough".  We were just talking about some guy that neither of us knew, and she mentioned that "at least he would probably flirt with me" and gave me a smirk.      I do things like tease her and push her, and we always talk as if we're in a relationship (and that we have children lol) but apparently that's not enough. Does anybody have any good "moves" to flirt with a girl?      Thanks for your answers! :)

20090223102937AA3gZax	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I don't think my gf loves me as much anymore?	We just got a place together and been together for 14 months. She doesn't look at me the same as much anymore, she doesn't seem so happy to see me as much like when we started dating. I love her so much though!!! I'm doing things to try and put the spark back with us, stuff we used to do when we started dating like having a lot of sex and pleasing her the best I can. Buying her some gifts, things I know she loves but it doesn't seem to be lasting long. She thinks I don't give her enough attention and I know I have done some stuff but I apologized for them. I feel like she expects me to be the perfect boyfriend. I don't want to lose her, what am I going to do?!
20090223102933AAoR7qn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend isn't interested in sex...  What's the problem?!?	Let me start by saying, she's my first and I'm her fourth.     We've been dating for over a year now, and it seems like our sex life is just boring.  I love romance.  I love passion.  I want slow sex that last.  I love just holding her, talking about anything and everything.  Kissing her.      But during sex, that rarely happens.   I've tried everything to spice up our sex life.  Nothing works.  I'll try to stretch foreplay out longer, nothing.  Once I go inside her, she dries up almost instantly.  Not that she gets very wet to begin with.         She just never initiates sex.  She shows no interest.  I bought her a vibrator because this problem made my self-esteem drop so much that I felt ugly.  I thought I was the problem, and that I was punishing her.  So I bought her the vibrator, and still nothing.  She just isn't sexual at all.   How do I fix this?      I'm sick of her trying to rush me during sex.  I hate that she feels obligated to have sex, she doesn't just do it to do it.  How do I get passionate, meaningful sex from her?

20090223052357AAgf60h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell him this without making him want to leave?	I've been going through a LOT right now. I'm up at college, four-five hours away from home. I've worked really hard and got a 4.0 my first semester, but adjusting to college life has been harder for me than I would have thought. I am always extremely homesick and I miss the people I care about most (My family, friends, and boyfriend).          It doesn't help that my first semester my father was battling cancer, which he beat, and that now this semester both my mother and grandfather are battling health issues of their own. My mother just had surgery on her neck, which went well...until she found out she had a clot in her lung and they had to rush her back to the hospital for more surgery. She's okay now. My boyfriend, whom I've only been dating for a little over a month, is amazing and drove all the way up here to get me and bring me back home to see her this weekend. My grandfather was just diagnosed with Mersa and Pneumonia. Needless to say it's been hard for me to handle. I feel like at times I take things out on him and I don't mean to at all. I've been getting anxiety, which is probably really crazy, and am wishing I could be closer to home.      How do I explain to my boyfriend that I am going through anxiety without pushing him away? I know he's a great and understanding guy, but I also don't want to add stress to his life. I just would love to be able to open up more, but I don't want him to think I'm crazy.   Am I even normal for feeling this way?

20090223055051AARf5XU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a question for both men and women?	I have know my bf for about a year. Sex has become some what boring for me so I suggested we try different things like toys or positions. He has said a few times that black pantie hose really turn him on so yesterday I went out and bought some and dressed up in a skirt and blouse knowing that he was going to pick me up for dinner. He came over but wanted to go into the bedroom right away. He kept saying that I wanted to try something new and I soon found out what he was talking about. He was wearing black pantie hose under his pants. I was shocked but I tried to keep an open mind. We had a great time but now I'm wondering what man could do this? How could a man put these on himself and like it? I'm also wondering if all this time he was saying that black pantie hose really turn him on if he was referring to him wearing them and not me? I didn't like the idea of him in them at all and don't know what to do. I want to ask him if he has done this in the past or crossed dressed before. We are both in our 40's and I'm very freaked out by what he did. Please tell me what your thoughts are. Thank you.
20090223055233AA0SO7W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Help Me With This Guy?	Okay well i have known this guy for about 5 years now and i have liked him for two of those years. He always told me that he liked me back and he always flirted with me anytime i would flirt with him.       Well awhile ago he asked me out and of course i said yes. But then he broke up with me about three days later and told me he just wasn't ready for a girlfriend and i understood that and we were still friends and everything.      But then the day after he broke up with me he got a girlfriend that doesn't even live in the same town and they don't even see each other which i don't really understand but whatever makes them happy.      See my problem is i can't get over this guy i like him so so much and part of me wants to get over him and part of me wants to fight for him. Do i keep talking to this guy like i don't care o do i just stop talking to him all together? I need help please!!!      Sorry this is kinda long i just really need help right now.

20090223060845AAJysL1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 16 and I have a crush on a english teacher!?	Why is it 16 year olds fall for teachers? Well, this teacher is in my school, he is just out of university so he is about 23 or 24. I don't have him for english but I know he is an excellent teacher because of students who has had him before. The class he does have from my year level is totally horrible and does not listen to him and everybody in my year level thinks he is a bad teacher...but thats because they have never given him a proper chance to teach. I feel so sorry for him and feel obliged to defend him. I speak to him about other stuff other than school work because I am not in his class and he is just so handsome! I melt when i see him and yes i know its only a crush but how do i get over him? I know he is also pretty angry with his class and would like to make him feel better but how?
20090223062738AApb2UL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really just don't know what to do :(?	Hi!      I have been engaged to my partner since November. We go to the same uni and study the same degree (he's in the year below) and practicaly live together (I'm always over his place). The problem is the way he treats me sometimes really hurts, and it's resulted in me wanting to be with someone else (who actually listens to me, but is married). If I've been out all day, then it'll always be loads of questions to try and catch me out, to see if i'm lying to him. The other night I thought i'd broken my finger and said that I might have to go to the hospital, so i couldn't go salsa dancing with him and his friend. He said that: 'He would come with me but he's waiting for his friend.' I understood, but was alittle taken aback by what he said. i said that that was fine, and he said: 'Thanks for being so considerate'. I ended up going to my nan's after because my grandad had recently died of cancer, to cheer her up. i didn't look at my phone, until I got back to my fiance's, who started having a go at me, and said that I ignored him on purpose. I assumed that seeing as he was in salsa dancing then he wouldn't need to be phoning me to find out where I was. I snapped at him because he was clearly accusing me of something and said: 'Look, I'm not one of your exes, okay!' He took offence and demanded that I apologised. I did just to clear the air.   The next few nights came along and i went to go and see my friend. I started walking back because it was too late and phoned my fiance to come and get me. He told me to get a taxi, but i had no money to which he jut replied: 'So, why are you phoning me?'. I told him to just forget it, and hung up.   He sees me in uni, but just ignores me. I texted him and said: 'Well don't say hi to me then!' as a joke, and he replies 'Ok!' I don't know whether this is acceptable in a relationship, and thinking about someone else that I can't be with is driving me crazy, because i know that i should be sorting things out with my fiance. I was just thinking of collecting my stuff and going back to my place and not telling him, i've just had enough, but I don't want to break up with him. I guess i'm just confused. He plays poker excessively and is glued to his xbox. I just don't know what to do. What do you guys think? xxxx

Last night my baby daddy called my cell phone and I answered it, but yet he's saying a man answer it. My phone is kind of old and the service in our area is like a 2.5 so its real low (I have to sleep with my cellphone by the room window). He said he called the phone back about 5 times after the so call men answer the phone but my phn never rang. He showed up to my house last night like 2 minutes after the so called man answer my phone but he didn't saw any man there, I was in my bed with my baby asleep. I wish I could take a lie detector test because thats the only I feel like he'll believe me, I tried every thing so what do I do now?
20090223064828AAcWXBc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is she doing to me?	Hey guys, I'm REALLY confused right now, so please just bear with me and read my whole thing! I know its long!! :(      I met this girl that I really liked and we are both in first year uni. So After getting to know her a bit, I asked her out to lunch and we did stuff like we went to this dance and she danced with me the whole night. It seemed like we were really clicking, so I told her how I want to be more than just friends and that I like her alot, and I asked her about how she feels. She replied that she needed more time. So about 2 days later, we finished working on an assignment, and it was really late at night and she offered to "stay up with me" for the rest of the night since it was like 6 am and there was no point in sleeping. So when we were walking back from handing in our assignment, she kind of grabbed my arm and rested her head on my shoulder, but I didn't really respond to it, I just let her do whatever. And when we got back, she let me sleep on her lap and she was like brushin my hair and touching my ear.      So I thought this was a clear "YES" to my question earlier. However, the next day we talked again, but this time she wasn't as "intimate". We sat down but like we were kinda far apart and we never really "connected". So I'm asking myself whats going on. and about 2 months she's been just acting like my friend and not doing anything that friends wouldn't do. But one time, she had to go somewhere to buy something and asked me to come with, so i went and we held hands walking, but nothing more. I guess it could have something to do on my part that I didn't really make any move or indicate to her that i liked her?      And so even more time passed and I asked her out again to chill but it was very unsuccessful. So I decided to ask her AGAIn what is going on and how she feels about me. She replied this time by saying that she wasn't really looking for anyone and that she just wants to meet new people.      So I took the "rejection" kind of hard, but I accepted it and respected her decision. I tried to give her time and space and not talk to her, but ever since she told me "she wasn't interested", she's been talking to me WAY more often and getting me to come over to her place, but nothing ever happens.       My friends tell me that she just wants attention, so just get her jealous by getting another girl and she'll want me back? But others tell me that she still likes me and wants me, but I need to "Prove" to her that I really like her instead of saying it???      I'm really confused right now and I DON"T know what to do.. Whether to keep pursuing her or to just move on. I still have deep feelings for her. And ever since I've been at uni I've been living with this stupid thought at the back of my mind. "does she like me?" Even after asking her twice, the answer is unclear.      What do you think? and what should i do?
20090223064834AAKYfQZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you think about this person?	This guy and I are workmates. We were cool but we are not talking now because of something he did. OK things started with a bank promotion. The bank we worked started promotion of a gift by application a few of us applied to it and a month later 3 of them came back. But not mine so this guy told me that he got it but he didn't fill any forms. So in the evening, I think I did something dumb, I asked him who got those deliveries and from whom. He said the one was to his name. I got my answer. Later in  the morning he called me near the delivery guy and told him he wants to know they are for me or not..I got mad and told him this is childish why do you involve other people?He said you disturbed me last night..I said so why did you answer me then?Blah blah...      I am not still talking to him. I just wanted to know maybe mistakenly he took it because he didn't apply for it.Now we are not talking and I

20090223065207AAmgfHn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce as per Hindu Marriage act?	Hi, I am currently residing in UK since 5 years. Around october last year I got married agreeing my parents. I had several other relationships previously and now do not have any affair. However my wife is always suspicious about me and my behaviour and this leds me to dislike her. I have blatantly told my wife that I do not have any interest in her and we have no physical relatioinship since three to four months. one of the reason I hate my wife is that her attitude and thinking is completely against mine, and we conflict in minor things. Recently my wife has decided to go back to india and wants to file divorce. I would agree with it if I know: (a) my ownership to a property in UK will be spilt on divorce? (b) will I have to pay any maintanance despite we dont have any kids? I think my wife will agree for mutual divorce but her father might demand a ransom or her part in my asset. I have never asked for any sort of money since wy wife has moved to UK and i pay all my bills. Please help me to find what are her rights to claim benifits from me.
20090223065652AACb3TR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend gets dirty jokes on his phone from other women...?	My guy gets stupid dirty jokes on his phone from his female friend(s). I've never met any of these women and supposidly one of them is his friends' ex wife.    Should I wonder why in the heck their communcation is all about dirty jokes - maybe these women send jokes to all their friends...But it seems a little inappropraite to me for him to be getting them for some reason... I haven't addressed this issue with my bf because i don't want to seem controlling and it's not a jealousy thing (i got plenty of dirty jokes but I would never send them to my friends out of respect and I think it's tacky).   Is it a big deal? when he tells them to me, I say "boy, I'm an angel compared to your other girlfriends." and i try to shrug it off..
20090223065942AAOyRur	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Betrayal or not, what would you girls do?!?	A few months ago I caught my boyfriend of then 3 months with a picture of some girls boobs saved in his phone. His excuse was a forward that a guy friend sent him...ok, but I never did believe him, I just forgot about it. I also found at the same time a picture that had been taken from his phone of a sheet of paper with his name and his best girl friend's name with hearts on it. His excuse was since her boyfriend of 4 years had just passed away, he was trying to cheer her up because they'd been friends for 10 years....ok whatever, a little extreme, but I let it go since he never hangs out with her.      Then yesterday I found 6 naked/lingerie pictures of another girl in his email that he had emailed to himself from his phone. When questioned he laughed and didn't want to tell me who it was. I got it out of him anyways...it was his best guy friend's girlfriend. I also noticed both incidents were blonde girls, so I asked about the other one in his phone and he confessed it was the same girl. All these pictures were supposedly from that same guy friend. I knew all along he was lying about that picture in his phone.....and he did lie.      So this is too many indiscretions. We have been together for 8 months now and I have loved him so much. He has treated my  like a queen. He is/was basically what every girl would want...at least all the girls in his town want him. We live 4 hours apart and he drives every other weekend to come see me, and I drive those other weekends to see him. I know he hasn't physically cheated on me, and I doubt very seriously he would cross that line. I know it's just a guy to look at those pictures and like them, but to cognitively save one to his phone, and email the other 6 to his email, and then go home and check that email and look at those pictures again.....when he is in a committed relationship that he went so far to get me and had already told me those 3 little dangerous words, I love you, that is just showing no respect for me at all and it is very unacceptable. He should have just called his friend up and been like those are nice pictures and all but man you shouldn't be sending me pics of your girlfriend, that's not right....and he should have deleted them.      I am so upset about this and he has disappointed me highly! I don't know what to think and I don't know what to do. I went into this relationship with no trust for men (coming from my  last relationship) and I was open and honest with  my current boyfriend and he said that was ok, that he knows it will take time to gain trust again for anyone, and of course he said I could trust him. Well now this puts whatever trust I gained out the window. I can't trust him now with his phone, his email, his myspace, anything internet/phone related.       Girls what would you do and suggest? Do you think I'm freaking out about nothing?

20090223075009AAu4klj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Lost the dream girl (Killing or not)?	I lost the girl I thought would be a perfect match for me and I love her ! There is a guy who is a "street-er"[so am I] but now .... he did the one thing I will never forget in my entire lifetime.      the girl I love and I ... before ... we liked each other ..(while it lasted for her) and then she "ditched me" because of all the conversations that were "kept a secret " from anyone and now the whole school sees me as a "dead man"(Zombie, faithless).She is freaked out by me. Not only I have OCD, Social Anxiety Disorder and severe depression, but I have thoughts abut killing him, her and my self ! Most think I'm insane. Now everyone is teasing me coz he and her ....on wensday ...       We are all 14 !      nothing hurts more .... not even the 2 bullets on the borderline of Cosovo, not the knife that ended up close to my heart, not the "bang - bangs" on the street.      Nothing. All I think abut is death. Tell me 1 thing. I've got a "steel sorta hammer thingie" (ON the front an axe end, and the other with a wider square shaped end to demolish walls) ...where to hit him in the head if I want him "out of my school" for at least 3 months ?

Okay; I my girlfriend just moved back to Georgia lastnight.<3      We got into an entirely huge argument; she said the only way I can have a chance with her is if I see her again. I'm basically completely in love with her, and wouldn't trade her for the world.      If I told you I was going to walk 523 Miles (about 7 days, 2 hours) Would you be literally astounded? Or what? Just out of love for one individual, what would you say? I don't have any way to transport myself so walking is my only way, and I'm fine with that, as long as I can be with her.

I confronted him and he told me that yes he is in fact meeting her and his friends before poker. I did tell him in the past that i wasnt cool with him hanging out with her but I was upset he hid that from me, he told me he wasnt allowed time for me to tell him since "i did the research on my own" later on the evening when we were talking he told me he stayed for longer at the bar with them and that he was just going to go home. I was upset and told him that he is a liar for hiding the truth from me and he told me that he would never hurt me and that they remained friends from that relationship. I did end up forgiving him but deep in my heart i feel the trust is gone for good. should I let this one go or just end it?

20090223084037AAfdsms	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We often talk on phone or chat. But she never makes the first step. What does it mean?	So we haven't met yet. Only online and on phone. But I always have to call or write her at first.    I always get a quick answer and every time we talk on phone it last more than an hour. I don't think that she's shy. But she has a hard work and tells me the best time to call her. She also say she wants to meet me asap.      Does it mean something? Because I like her much.
20090223084119AAMqFhd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he obsessed with me..?	Okay so my boyfriend and I have been dating a year. We have always been super close, even when he moved in November. We see each other almost every single weekend. But I when i'm not with him, he calls me about 7-10 times a day. And if I dont answer he just keeps calling back intill I do. When hes not calling hes texting and if I dont text back within 20 seconds he starts sending more. He doesn't like it when I hang out with my friends cause he wants to talk to me.       I love talking to him of course. But if we talked for 5 hours straight on the phone yesterday why should it be a big deal if I wanna hang out with some friends today?   He said he liked it better when I didn't have friends in the beginning of our relationship.   And he doesn't like me hanging out with any guys even though I have no interest in them at all.    I love him.   Im just a loner and every once in a while would like an hour to read a little bit.   But I also want one day of the week to hang out with my friends.   He doesnt want me to have friends :[ he "wants me all to himself" he says.   Everyone says hes overly obsessed with me!   Do you think he is?      How do I say something without making it sound like I dont wanna talk to him when I do!
20090223084259AAoYhO4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this relationship going too slowly or is it okay?	Come on, im only 17 i've never actually had a girl friend. And this girl who came to our class last year is just amazing. We slowly started becoming friends. And since the beginning of this year, I feel our bond strengthening.       We sit next to each other in every possible class. 70% of the time she came to sit with me. I've never met anyone like her, we're so similar yet different. I've never felt so happy and comfortable with anyone else in my life. During recess we often go to the music room and play piano and sing. And we talk LOTS! Mostly about her lol.      Question time... Am i just a good friend or does she like me also as a boyfriend??? In a lot of classes, she always askes me questions and gets up really close to me, she also pulls her chair close up to mine and often her legs are pointing towards me(which i've heard is a good thing). She said she needs to start earning money. and i said we could maybe do some photography work for my dad. She seems really really eager to do it...      This is all SO CONFUSING! I could just be a good friend or maybe she wants to be my girlfriend, which would be out of this world!!! :) Wats give-aways can i look out for? And wat should i do from here? btw we not like normal kids, we have minds like disney loving, fun having 12 year olds, so i dont think romantic restaurants or clubs are for us... Thank you so much for your help!!!!!!

20090223084836AAxO71k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Boyfriend drinks...and I dont...how to be okay with this?	This is gonna sounds like a really dumb question but I cant stand drinking. It doesnt make me feel good, it doesnt make me happy, i dont like not feeling in control of my body and I feel happy enough about myself as is that I just dont drink. It has nothing to do with religion or a family member experience i just dont like it. And most of my friends dont either....i guess us non party college kids tend to stick together. But the problem is recently my boyfriend has started drinking....not around me or anything but he goes to these parties with his friends and then drinks.....and he doesnt tell me about it. i found out from one of his friends who thought I knew. I dont know what to do. I confronted him about it and he said he felt terrible and just didnt wanna disappoint me...but it stings....not even the fact that he lied about it....just I dont know how to deal with a boyfriend who drinks when im so aganist it         i know I have no right to ask him to stop drinking. It is his choice and his decision and hes not even doing it around me....so how do I make myself feel okay it???

Myself & my partner have been going out for over a year, during the December period, we started having problems, the problems lasted for a little over a month. For the past week, we've been doing extra good & i've been very happy & hopeful.

I know enough to know that he'll come back in a matter of days if I let him go. I'm suspect that he's cheating. I love him very much & don't want to loose him. He's 37 & I'm just baffled as to why he'd still be playing games at his age. I'm convinced we can make it work, but he's not. I don't want to leave & then go back. I'm convinced that staying with him & helping him through this hard time will make sense.      I'm hurt & in love & don't know what to do. I need your help & advice pls.

When we got to together it was out of chance. We hit it off from the start. I was in a relationship and at the time he was also in one. We started as friends and slowly became more. I broke things off with my ex as soon as things progressed, he also decided at that time to separate from his wife. They do have a child together and are on good terms with each other. He tells me everyday how much he loves me and can't see his life with out me. He even talked about marriage with me as soon as him and his wife are fully divorced.       But a few days ago I found his ring on the floor it had fallen out of his pocket. I didn't know that he kept that on him. What do you think it means???? He does have his own place and does not lie with her.

Amy then shouted at him calling him a little perv and told him that she hoped his balls popped. The teacher see this and pulled her into the office by which time the lad was puking on the floor.       My parents went to the school today (Monday). The principle decided that a one week suspension for Amy is appropriate, however the boy is also going to have a one week suspension put on his record although he is unlikely to be able to return to school during the weeks suspension due to the extent of his injuries.       The boy had surgery friday and the doctors repaired his left testicle that had been ruptured, although due to the damage sustained the testicle will not be able to produce any sperm. The boys right testicle had to be removed due to it having multiple ruptures.       The boys mother and my parents have agreed that this should be the end of the matter. Amy is not happy at being suspended as she feels that it was self defense and their were people who saw the incident that backed her story up.      I do agree with Amy in the respect that the boys injuries are as a direct result of his actions and that she should nt be held responsable for injuries he suffered.      1. Do you think she did the right thing?   2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage?   3. What would you have done?   4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do?   5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?   6. How would you feel if it was your daughter in this situation?   7. How would you feel if it was your son in this situation?

20090223102752AA6lWqb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Dating someone going through a divorce. (please keep reading! I know this happens all the time)?	Okay here goes..      About 6 weeks ago one day after work, an older guy (he's 35, I'm 23) that I work with (and have always been friendly with, always have had a slight crush on - but never told anyone about) called me and asked if his soon to be ex wife had emailed me. I was puzzled as to why she would, and he said she thought we were "together" and was going to spill the beans to our boss. (please note, my boss doesn't care if co-workers date, as long as it doesn't interfere with work, so her effort was pointless, and she never did email) I told him that she hadn't, but if she did, I would let him know. End of conversation.   About 45 minutes after I get home from work I get a text from him saying how he didn't mean to sound derogatory at all to me, that he would jump at the chance to go out with me, that I'm a sweet, loyal, attractive person, and had he been younger, he would have asked me out months ago. I didn't know how to respond, I was shocked. I told him no worries, anytime you need a friend, all that good stuff.   Well he texted back (and then we texted pretty much all night) saying how he appreciates that so much, and how much he respects me and that he's had a crush on me for years, but never would say anything since he was married (they have been seperated since July 08, divorce is not final yet, BTW) He told me about the times we ran into each other at concerts and how he wished he could have hung out with me then, how he never thought he would have a chance with me at all, and that he never even thought he would say all that, but had to take the chance or he would regret it. He told me that I'd be a dream come true for him and we'd never know if we didn't try.   By the end of the night, I was still in disbelief. I mean, I have seriously had a crush on this (older, married with 2 kids, co-worker) guy for almost 5 years. I told him I would think about it and talk to him in the morning.   The next day we had lunch, for 2 hours, and ever since then several lunches, dinners, and hang out at home movie nights have followed. I really like him a lot. I even hung out with him and his youngest (3 yr old son, he has an 8 yr old daughter as well) one afternoon.    Does anyone have any advice other than "run for the hills" or "follow your heart"? I've heard all that before.    He's mentioned me spending time with the kids, which in my opinion, should wait. His ex already has a BF that has stayed the night with the kids at home, and I certainly don't want them to see me in the same light as that guy (and only weeks after seperating.. his ex is a douche to her kids) and I am worried about the daughter. 8 is a critical age for a young woman to experience her parents divorce. How will she be towards me? She already knows me, she's been to the office several times. But I know from her dad that she's been acting up lately, and she's been a bit spoiled her entire life. The 3 yr old is a cute little dude, and I don't worry about him so much because he is so young and won't remember. But any advice on the children issue will help. I've never dated anyone with kids before, and I'm not around children very often. (ick. here comes that inevitable thing - I want them to like me)   So his divorce isn't final, and I know he spends a lot of time arguing with his ex over bullshit (disciplining the kids, who gets what, and I don't even know what else bc I don't ask), I mean, how bad is this that we got involved at this stage?   I know that he likes me, and I trust him to not disrespect me or treat me unfairly, that's just the type of guy he is. But it bothers me (I mean, come on, how can it not?) that they are always bickering back and forth. He won't come right out and talk to me about it, and why would he? He wants to dial that down when we are together, probably to prevent me from running for the hills.    I don't know what to do. I like this guy. I wish he was officially divorced though. I don't mind that he has kids, his kids are great. I just don't want to face this if I know it won't turn out well. Dating someone going through a divorce is a completely different animal.   I'm gunshy. I've been hurt before and haven't been involved in a relationship in over 3 years. I've dated but no guy has ever really made me feel butterflies. Real ones. I don't want to get hurt by him, even if he doesn't mean to do it. I also don't think I can walk away from him. It's been 6 weeks, which is longer than any other guy in the past 3 years, so I feel like I can trust myself enough to know that I genuinely want to make something out of this. I realize that I cant be in a "serious realtionship" with someone who isn't officially divorced, and I think I am okay with taking it slow..   I think after typing all this, I've figured out what bothers me the most is him and her arguing. Shouldn't they just let the lawyers handle it?! I know for a fact that there is no way they are getting back together, neither one of them want that. But she is SO damn good

20090223103405AAVkQ8V	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can my husband and I make our marriage work?	My husband and I had one hell of a 2008, we both had affairs (mine after his, really as revenge and for self esteem) and after we've basically torn each other to shreds, we both just really want to be with eachother. The affairs happened for short amount of time between october/november of 2008 and now its been about four months and were trying our best to put it in our past. We have a 6 month old son that we treasure immensly and we spend every minute with eachother when we are not at work. The love, lust and attraction is still there for my husband and I and in a way, after our affairs, we both felt like we were falling in love with eachother all over again. Has anyone ever been in a similar situatuon?
20090223103451AAve4j8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you ever take your first love back after they left you twice for another person?	Hi all,      Your friend here needs a little help and advice. Here is the situation ok, I have been dating my ex-girlfriend for the past 6 years. She is about to turn 21 years old in 2 months. Our relationship has always been solid. We get along so well and always make each other laugh constantly. Been though so many ups and downs regarding her family not wanting her to date and such but we fought through it. She moved in for the last 2 years for college. Our relationship has always been great when we were together. The only thing is that she wanted to party more and be more social and going to clubs and all. To me, I told her, all that really doesn't matter because I have the love of my life next to me and that is all I needed to make me happy. I'm not a drinker or smoker. She wanted me to start drinking when we go hang out with friends or when they come over sometime, but I choose not to.      Last year at around this time when we were still living together, I found out that she cheated on me with a guy and she later found out that he has a kid already. I sort of force things to get her to come back and she did. It lasted two months with this guy and I got her to moved back in with me.      Everything was great, we started going out. Just last year alone, we went to Disneyland, SeaWorld, San Diego beach, Water rafting, Snowboarding, santa cruz beach boardwalk, etc.. She's always happy when we're together.      Then all of a sudden, on Tuesday night at around 11:30pm three weeks ago, I finished taking a shower and came to bed, she said while laying her head the other way, "have you notice that something has been bugging me for the past 3 months." I said, "no, what is it." long story short, she said she's attracted to this guy that came to the salon to get a hair cut. While she was cutting his hair, he told her that he's a Stanford MBA graduate, vice president of Well's Fargo, said that he got $150,000 bonus from his job last year, he said he have traveled to Thailand, Bora Bora, etc. He said if your my girlfriend I would take you to all these places. He told her that she doesn't have to work if she is his wife and he also drives the latest BMW edition. So she is fascinated about all these stuff. Then I help her moved all her stuff back to her mom place, She's dating this guy right now as we speak. He's 29 years old 6'2.      So I'm very depressed and starting hanging out with my friends more often, everybody was very shock that we broke up. I showed them a picture of who she's dating and they said, "I know this guy, my wife knows this guy, they went to high school together, she know where he was rasied, he dated so many girls." One of my friend said at first they feel sorry for me, but after seeing this guy, they said they feel sorry for my ex-girlfriend, they said you shouldn't compare yourself to this guy, your a much better person, he's a con-artist, he dated about 10 girls already, he take girls from their boyfriend and dump them and the girl run back to their ex always.      So my question is, should I take my ex back if she ever ask me back. Right now I still love her and will always. She ask me, "you don't hate me after I have done this to you." I told her that my love for her is unconditional and that I don't see myself ever again loving another girl as much as I love her. I do love her very much. She also told me, that her boyfriend right now is very boring and that he doesn't make her laugh like I do. She said she attracted to him for his looks and wealth. She told me that he's going to buy her a $90,000 car, asked her to engage, and said she's going to get her passport because this guy is taking her to tahiti.      Have you guys been through the same situation and end up successful. I really do want to work things out with her and I don't want my heartbroken again because it really hurt. What can I do to make it last? Anything will help, and thank you very much for taking the time to read my story.

So here's the problem he lies about stupid **** and then it gets worse when we're dealing with real problems. Another thing is that he and i got into an argument the other day and he was like fine if you want to end it then do it because i don't have time for this **** anymore.

20090223105545AAFStJF	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Does anyone know a place where I can hold an inexpensive wedding reception in the Atlanta area?	My wedding day is fast approaching and I still have one last thing I really need to take care of, and that's finding a place to hold my reception at, I have been looking online and the prices are really ridiculous not to mention I have to pay for their catering service and I really don't need it, because my friends and family are willing to cook and serve themselves. I thought I found a good place with the Clayton County International Park ($800 deposit, $300 is refundable) but the representative stated that its mandatory I use 1 out of 2 of their caterers. Their caterers charge $20-$25 per person which is the same amount as the other halls and caterers I have contacted. I will be having between 60-80. So as you can see the price will be really steep and I was thinking to ask everyone to pay for their plates but decided against it, because they may not want the food the caterers make. So can someone help me out plz are there websites or space I may be able to use that anyone knows of that has reasonable rates. I live in College Park GA so I am looking in the Fulton and Clayton County areas. Also I would like to have some (not alot) of alcohol too. Thank you for taking the time to read this and assisting me in this situation.
20090223105938AAiMJzN	Family & Relationships;Family	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality. And look at male-female relations. With all the complaints of "political correctness" walk into any college fraternity or bar and cavemen ethics still rule.      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.       So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

20090223110019AAxmydo	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother went through my notebook...i think...?	Okay, so I was gone all weekend basically. I slept over at a friends house on friday and saturday and came home sunday afternoon. When I came home, I went straight to my bedroom to call my friend and my mom came in and started saying "Honey, we need to talk..." and so I was like alright. Now, I've known my mom thinks i'm on drugs she always asks me and I tell her no, which is the truth. I've never smoke, drank, or done drugs in my life. And everytime I tell her she doesn't believe me. And all of a sudden she started talking about STDS. She told me she doesn't want me to get HIV. She's never talked to me about that before because she knows that i'm aware of sex. I was a little shocked. She said "You can get HIV by sex and also by sticking things in your mouth that don't belong there" . I burst out laughing. Now, I have done things like that and wrote about them in my notebook and that's the only way she would have known. And then she started talking about how she doesn't like me having sleepovers with my friends so often. I snuck out about a month ago and wrote about that. So maybe that's what she was referring to. And Saturday night she called me crying. I don't know why. She asked if I was happy over the phone and I was like yeah...and I told her goodnight and hung up. She's been acting all weird since then and I don't know what to do about it. Maybe she read my notebook to find out if I was on drugs (my friend came over the other day and she was eating a lot so my mom assumed she was high). I'm really stressed about this. How do I fix things with my mother without asking if she read anything?      sorry this was way lonnng.

I'm way over my ex-boyfriends, and I want to believe that he's over his ex-girlfriend.      She's a vapid slut that cheated on him twice. Somehow, he believe that they're still "friends" (they broke up a little over a year ago). She texts him more than I think she should (sometimes daily). She also constantly wants to hang out with him. I know he'll humor her and they'll go out for lunch every once and a while (he says that she pays her half and I have no reason not to believe him).       He knows that it bothers me, but he also doesn't want to hurt her feelings because they're "friends". Is she ever going to go away? Is there a nice way to make her go away? Do I ever get to put my foot down? I really don't want to give an ultimatum, so any ideas?

20090223110603AA8uo1i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend Stressed with work OR Cheating on me ?	Im very very confused.   My boyfriend was super romantic when we first started dating.   i know things always cool off after the honeymoon period.   BUT he has gone from writing poems, taking me to lavish dinners, to spending 3-4 days a week with me to just seeing me 1-2 times a week and also bringing me home EARLY from the last 4 dates.   (usually we would stay out until 2-3 am, now he will bring me home by 10-11:30pm)   On valentine's day instead of the great dinners he planned when we were dating he took me to a very cheap indian place. and gave me a mug and chocolates (meanwhile i gave him rare wine)   he keeps saying he is exhausted and stressed because he has to raise money for his biz by mid march.   he keeps going on dinners with friends or a 'a friend' .... he says theyre 'steak and cigar' dinners to raise money from venture cap guys..    im really uncertain if he is cheating cleverly OR really stressed....      he is 40 years old and has been doing this kind of work for 14 years, i would think he would be used to the stress by now and also the amount of money he is flipping out over doesnt seem like that much (75,000)   and he cant get a business loan for it he says..         thoughts ?   what are signs of cheating ?

20090223111224AAF3Rua	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	American girls/women help!?	Firstly me and my girlfriend have a very big long distance relationship, i live in London and she lives in California but because i work for an airline i fly to California every other day, so we see each other quite often. But i have a hard time figuring her out (is it an American girl thing?). We have been going out for a while and we trust each other but whenever i do what i think is a nice thing for her see doesn't seem all that excited! I always buy her things and she doesn't seem all that excited or happy, i always take her to the best resturants and she is just miserable about it and the first time she came to London she was really excited and we went to all of the tourist places and she was really happy but now whenever she comes to London she is always miserable and doesn't want to do anything. SO i know what your going to say but i really like her and most of the times shes fine but why does she not like anything that i do for her?      Is she using me?   Does she not like me anymore?   Is it worth be even bothering?   Is it because we live so far away from eachother?   Whats her problem?
20090223111524AASveA2	Family & Relationships;Family	Relationship problem - move in or move out?	My boyfriend and I have been together for almost three and a half years and we are planning to get married. Everything is perfect between us except for one thing: My boyfriend lives in rural area and loves it. His family and friends are all there as well as his workplace. As for me I was born as an urban girl and loves the town. I love the atmosphere, the busy place and people.      The problem is in one year we're getting married and the problem of "moving in - moving out" took place. My boyfriend is very stubborn and refuses to move in town. We've been discussing about it for sometimes now but apparently he is not the one willing to yield. Hence as i love him and don't want to lose him, i'm the one who is taking the decision of moving to his village. Unfortunately, everyday i keep thinking of the facilities i'll be missing after my marriage, such as the bus station, the shopping mall and arcades. Even my work place (which is in town) will be far as everyday i'll have to travel for more than one and half hour to reach there. I have told my boyfriend about these things but he told me that he sure i'll be okay with that with time. I cannot bring myself to argue because we always end up fighting.      I am afraid that i might not be able to adapt to that situation of moving to the rural. Please help me take a decision. I really don't know what to do.

20090223111213AAL4x6a	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	LADIES AND GENTS: YOUR OPiNION PLEASE THANKS?	hiya      this is a quote from a message (there were other parts) that this 22 year old attractive woman sent me - who i really like:      "But hey, if it doesn’t work out with this girl I’m sure there are plenty waiting to take her place! I’d say your a perfect catch, I mean on your personality alone your Way Way ahead of most guys I’ve met!"      Does she want to pursue a relationship with me? Or does she consider me a very close friend? As we facebook message each other like on average 2500 words each, cant decide whether or not she views me as a friend or potential boyfriend.      thanks
20090223110655AA834iv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you had a chance to get married would you get married by church or by court?	ok im going to get married (I'm engaged right now) and well me and my fiance we're talking and well we had already decided to get married by court but yesterday when we we're talking he told me out of nowhere lets get married by church..........I think it's a big step and how about if it doesn't work out and well i don't know but im glad he would actually consider getting married by church because he was the type that always said he wouldn't get married and never even crossed his mind to get married but i guess his mind changed we're still young and hopefully it goes all good but it's going to be kind of rough. So do you think getting married by church a good idea? O and i forgot to mention we've been together for almost 6 months and engaged for 2 months and we've known each other for 2 yrs. we were together 2 yrs. ago too but it didn't work out b/c of a backstabbing "friend" (if you can call someone like that a "friend") she flirted with him and we broke up he went with her and now we're together again and engaged planning about getting married in Dec. but now i don't know when or how (by church or court)

He gave me a copy of the papers after he filed and there were blanks still in the paperwork.  (The blanks that remained should have contained the balances of our checking accounts.)  I’m not sure what else was wrong with the ppwk, but we also own two homes and a boat together.  Our hearing is tomorrow. My question is could the judge deny/delay/dismiss the divorce because of the blanks or the more complicated nature of our possessions?

20090223111205AA4GxyX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In a guy's opinion what should i do?	Okay, i apologize before i even start writing, because this is going to be long.      There was this guy, who dated one of my friends in middle school, It was like an online dating thing you know, they had never met. Well they broke up about 5 months into their relationship, and hadn't talked since. It's been about 4 years, and we gained contact with him, and started talking, well me and him talked all the time, non stop, so he plans a trip down to come see us, (me and my friend) but the whole way down he talked to me, and he came straight to my house, where he stayed the whole week. But we hung out with her 2 nights, one of them was at my house, and she was throwing herself at him even though she knew i really liked him, and he wasn't really flirting back, but then the next time we hung out, i was having a bad night, and it pissed me off that she was doing that in front of my face so i went to my room, she got all mad and stormed off, and he went after HER and they spent the night out somewhere, nothing happened, and i know that for a fact, but still. Okay so the next morning he comes back to my house, and he spends his last night with me, and we slept together and all that good stuff, (let me just say, he doesn't sleep around, and neither do i) So whenever he left the next morning, i walked him to his car, and he hugged me, but I've never been hugged like this before, he squeezed me, like he was terrified of loosing me. and he said that "he'd keep in touch because it's hard to run away from me".      Okay so there's the most part of the story, one part i did leave out is while he was here we had the talk. He said he didn't want to be in a relationship because he was going to war at the end of april and he didn't want to do that to either of us, that he has seen what it does to relationships and he doesn't want that. So my question is, Do you think that he's just saying that because he really is scared of loosing me? and should i continue to talk to him while he's over seas and see what happens? I know he really cares about me, it showed in the hug, i just, i don't know what i should do.

20090223111631AAP8XGC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I keep a girlfriend?	This gorgeous gorgeous girl just fell on my lap, and she is infatuated with me, In the course of a week we became bf/gf and spent 6 out of the 7 days together. The reason she is special from the other girls ive dated is because shes smart too.... But with any girl ive had, even smart ones, I always run out of stuff to say. Normally it wouldn't bother me, but this new girl is such a keeper.... what do I do, will she dump me if there is too much awkward silence? I dont mind silence, but it always make me uncomfortable because I think they are uncomfortable.
20090223111805AAietXl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When is it safe to have sex without the guy just playing you? Ages 25 - 36 ONLY please!?	I know this is the age-old question, but I am going to ask it again EXCEPT I only want answers from men 25 – 36 years old.  When is it finally ok to put out? 2nd date? 3rd date?  Longer??  What are the signals they may give that means you are safe to proceed without getting hurt? I am not religious and have no other reason to hold out than to make sure the man knows I am not “easy” and that I am a good woman!?  I only want those opinions from that certain age group because I believe men in that age period will have a different opinion than someone younger or older…
