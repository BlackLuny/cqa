I've been reading my old bosses emails a couple times a week (I quit there months ago) and simply just reading, and they discovered someone has been in the email due to IP's being different.  I am absolutely freaked out that I'm in big trouble.  What can be done??  I definitely learnt my lesson and I will never go in again.  Can they trace this back to me, and are there any legal implications??

20090220073203AAqaEkP	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	MacBook Pro screen looks like a black light photo!?	My cat slept on my mac keyboard and now everything looks like on of those black light photos you sometimes see in political ads... skin black, eyes teeth white.  Even the yahoo background here is black while the letter I'm typing are white.   I've changed all the appearance setting and display settings... color, resolution.... but nothing has fixed it.      Any suggestions?
20090220073710AAHS5qT	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	I have a lot of questions about html.  Can someone please try to answer all or almost all of them?	I am just learning html, and I have a load of questions, some of which, may not even be answered.  I was wondering, you know how on a normal site you click on a text box and the text clears out automatically?  Well I wanted to know how to do that on one of my text boxes.  Ok so I want people to comment on my site, so inside the   and the   tags, I put        But once you click on the text box, you have to back out the Type your comment here.  How do I make it so as soon as someone clicks on the comment box, the type your comment here clears out, or at least highlights so when the user types the comment, the type your comment here will be overwritten?     My next question is that my form isn't working.  I've tried getting people to submit and send from outlook express, yahoo, att mail, and nothing works.So this is the form I used.  I'd rather you just correct what's wrong with it, and put the complete code in its original form with the corrections, than tell me what's wrong with it in little segments.                 Month of birth.          January         February         March          Ok, you get the point.  Let's get to the good stuff now.       What is your favorite sport to play out of the choices provided??    basketball    baseball    tennis       Please comment on my form.        upload a photo of yourself.                  My next question is how do you make one of those "type the characters in the picture you see or hear" boxes?  Those are rather cool, but if it takes more than html code, which it probably does, just let's say I wanted the characters to be lhRiC3oz9   How would I make a box with those characters?  Would you need to get a screenshot of the picture and upload the .gif file to the server?  Or what?   Next question: How would I make a print this page link?  Let's say I type up an article, but there's all this stuff in front of it that I don't want the printer to print.  How would I go about doing that?   Next question: How would I make an article I typed up open in a new window or tab?  In other words, how would I make a link that says open in a new window or tab?     Ok I think I've asked enough for today.  The most important questions are the text box selection, and the form email not working.     Good luck answering all these questions.  Best answer goes to whoever gets my form to work properly, in other words, it will send an email to me once someone presses the send button.

It's stuck in this perpetual loop, and it doesn't seem to be going away.      Unfortunately, the superdrive failed just a month out of warranty so I am unable to use the the drive for recovery discs. Would it be possibly to remove the hard drive, mount it in an external enclosure and run recovery on another computer with XP?

I've liked him and he's known since I was in 1st grade, he's 2 years older, I don't see him that often so we're not that close as friends. We were really close once, but that stopped after we didn't talk for about 3 years. He just broke up with his longtime girlfriend, and all his friends (who I don't know) are commenting on his "now single" thing on facebook. I never met his girlfriend, don't know her. I just want to comment on it as well to console him like a good friend, but I don't want him to get the wrong idea that I'm hitting on him or using it as an oppritunity to try to get him to go out with me or something. Like I said, I just want to tell him as a friend that I feel sorry for him. He knows that I don't have a boyfriend and thinks that I still like him (I do, but truthfully I like another guy more) So, should I comment or not?

20090220085142AAL4Bwt	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Can two separate organizations' websites (with separate domain names) share one host?	As it stands now, there are two separate (yet legally related) non-profit organizations with two separate websites (each with their own domain name and host). One website is  http://www.fbpcs.org  and the other is  http://www.fabbs.org.       However, both organizations are looking to redesign their websites and pool their resources.      What they want is to have one single website with pages of content for FABBS and pages of content for FBPCS. The one website would have a unified design, one content management system, etc.      The trouble is that each organization wants pages with their content to have their organization's URL in the address bar. For example, if you are on the FABBS donation page on the site, the URL should be something like  http://www.fabbs.org/donate.html  but if on that page you clicked a link that took you to the FBPCS membership page, the URL would need to change to  http://www.fbpcs.org/membership.html.       Is this even possible? We do NOT want one domain to simply redirect to the other, instead they need to switch back and forth based on content. We also can NOT use a third unified domain name (like www.fbpcsfabbs.org or something) or any type of subdomain.      Any advice you could provide would be great. Also, if you know of something like this in action elsewhere on the web, please post some links.      Thanks.

20090220093451AAqnfPr	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What's wrong with my computer?	Every time I turn on my computer (Vista) I get a "Runit" dialog box with "Runtime Error: 75  path/file access error".  My internet (Firefox) has also had several annoying pop-ups, and I also get a virus warning (which I think is fake) that starts an automatic scan from some online anti-virus thing asking me to download their product.  Other than these issues my computer seems to be working fine, but these are concerning to me.        I've scanned with Norton, Windows Defender and Spybot, all of which ensure me the computer is functioning normally (Spybot does tend to find several cookies, though).  The only other thing I can think of is a registry cleaner, but I hear that those occasionally cause more serious problems if you're not careful.        Do you have any suggestions?  Even, though, these minor issues haven't interfered with anything, I'm afraid that I may see a greater effect later.

Anyways, sometimes I'll try to watch videos on certain sites or listen to audio and a box with a puzzle piece comes up and says that a certain plug in is missing. It then says click to install missing plug ins, but when I do it searches and can't find any. So I click on manual install and it brings me to the Windows Media player site and offers a few players for me to install. I have tried a couple and they don't do anything (plus I already HAVE the latest version on this computer). What am I doing wrong? Where can I find the plug -in I need!!? HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is true for all of my .avi files. I've told it to open in windows media player when I double click on it, but it's set in stone to scan it with Spybot. I can open it, however, by opening media player and then opening the file. I want to know how to get rid of that option on Spybot because it's really starting to annoy me.

I made a mistake when putting in the website:      The website is:       http://prevx.com    not  http://previx.com       Prevx is a great antispyware/antivirus program that can prevent spyware and get rid of any infections you have on your computer.  It can be used as a stand-alone application or used in conjunction with other antivirus programs.  Please provide feedback if you use this program.  I'd like to learn more about it k?

20061029202738AAxbPCI	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	My 2X Geforce 7800GTX in SLI Mode doesnt seem to be working?	I have a dual core P4 with 4gig ram and 2x Gforce 7800GTX cards in SLI mode and the system does not function properly.  I was having problems with it shutting off by itself intermittently and installed a 700W power supply and corrected that.   The video performance sucks and it appears to be worse when run in SLI mode.  I have a 36" samsung LCD monitor run at 60 hertz.      My question I guess is how or where to I find a benchmarking utility and or repair program that can identify setup or hardware problems with this system.  My other computer has a Geforce 6600gt and in my opinion works better.  I have Company of Heros installed on the performance machine and my FPS in high res or low res maxes out at about 19.  IN world of warcraft I used to get 60fps consistantly and now only get around 25.  Any help would be appreciated

20090220095329AA6CFZk	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	First off thanks to Flake and Jung for their quick answers. i ended up taking my Dell to the Best Buy geek?	squad. The nice guy there said its a common problem with the Dell Studio motherboard and people have brought theirs back to the shop. He said i could choose another computer and so i looked at a HP G60-235DX which i would only have to put down another $20 for. The processor isnt as fast but all the reviews are good.   I told the dude i would take my laptop home to save my files and think about which computer to get and low and behold when i got home and switched the computer on then it was working perfectly and the former sound card problem had righted itself.   So here is my question..What should i do now? Should i take the risk and stick with this Dell and if it goes faulty again then take it back or should i not wait and just take it back now while the goings good and trade it for the HP?    Any thoughts?

Is the VirusScan helpful? And how do I get rid of this Trojan?

For several days my computer has been used as a spamming email machine, how do I know that?   I know because I was using Norton antivirus with it's email scanning capability active!   Suddenly my laptop's desktop started to get flooded with many many small windows from Norton's email scanning module that were showing where the email was beeing sent, it's title (that's how I know that they were sending out spam advertising) and also that it is being scanned/rejected/unable to be sent!   My computer gets overload so I had to deactivate email spamming! But my computer kept being very very busy. I unistalled Norton and tried AVG and NOD32. I think the last one did something but I am not sure if the problem is solved!I always check windows task manager and the local area connection status window to show any "redundant acticities".    How can I be protected from this once and for all?   I try to avoid heavy  programs such as Norton and Mcfee!!   Thank you people.

Up until an hour ago, my computer was working great. However, my computer failed to wake up after hibernating so I had to manually shut down. After I rebooted, my computer will not automatically connect to my wireless network. I tried others, but no success. Every time I hit "connect," I am brought to the profile wizard. So I've tried reconfiguring/resaving my wireless profile, but always end with an error message: "an internal database error occurred when saving/updating this profile." This message comes up even if I try to reconfigure other wirless network profiles that are not my own. Before, I would hit "connect" to any network (not password protected) or mine, and my computer would automatically connect. I also have two other computers on my wirless network so it can't really be the network... Someone please help!!

I was not aware of this; had I been, I would have saved a couple of months more to get an Apple.

20061223150755AAbSTS5	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	"Limited or no Connectivity in Home Network"?	Here's the deal:   I am trying to connect one computer to the internet through another with internet sharing.  Both are running XP and i HAVE done this before, it seems that something is screwing up with the ip address.  The set up is as follows: Computer one is connected to the internet through a cable modem (cable modem connects to the comp by USB) in "local area connection 3"  That connection works fine.  The second computer is connected to the first by a crossover cable between their ethernet cards in "Local area connection 1".  For some reason, on both computers i get a "Limited or no connectivity" warning between these two computers.  When i try to repair the connection on either computer it stops at "renewing IP address."  I have tried winsock fix on both computers and it didn't help.  Can someone please help me?  I think if i can get that local area connection one to work, then i could share the internet connection with computer 2 no problem.  Please leave detailed answers, thx.

I have a Dell L400 laptop.  I successfully partioned an E drive that had Windows XP and a C drive that had Windows 2000 Pro.  I then tried to merge the drives with Norton's Partition Magick (please note I am an idiot and did not make an emergency diskette as suggested by Norton) since I no longer needed or wanted Windows 2000 Pro.  When I re-booted there were 2 Operating systems to choose from (both said Windows default), but when you selected either of them you got error messages.  One message was a hal.dll error and the other was a boot partion error.      I tried to boot from the CD-Rom drive with  a Windows XP disc in the CD-Rom drive.  It said to press any key to continue, but nothing happens.  At this time I do not care if I lost everything that was previously on my hard drive, I just want to be able to use the lap top with Windows XP.  Please note I have the full Windows XP CD-Rom (not the upgrade version).      Thanks in advance !
