They both smoke, but I totally trust they did not smoke in the same roon as her.    When I got her back today everything stunk. I bathed her, washed all the clothes in her bag (some of which werent worn, but smelled). I sent up some toys, a shape sorter, and etch a sketch etc - they are all plastic, and after wiping them with antibacterial wipes, then milton, the still smell.    Any tips?
20090128131416AA52ziL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	What makes kids qualified to be taken away from their parents?	My siblings and I eventually got to live back with our mother (actually one was already 18 by the time she got custody again so it didn't matter for him), but my mother always used to blame neighbors and her other son for calling up on her and reporting. I don't see how one phone call to the department of social services could get us all taken away. Don't they have to investigate?      Well, yea, she finally got us back after years with a lawyer and stuff. The 'case' didn't close for another seven years though when we lived with her, so we had to go to therapy and all that crap. They had to ask our school how we do there, and come for visits to the home every week. Why do they do that?

I have exclusively breast fed and am getting to the stage now where I would like to be able to give a bottle so I can have a little bit of freedom ready for when I return to work. She has had a bottle in the past (admittedly it has only been on a few occasions) with no problem but now she point blank will not have any of it!  I have tried putting her in a different position, other people feeding her etc but she just spits the teat out. Does anyone have any suggestions?

We were having a little get together at our house a couple of months ago, and one of my husband's friend's wife was there, who was 8 months pregnant. She was drinking a beer. I thought it was pretty wrong. then she asked if I would make her a martini. I hid the vodka and told her we were out of liquor, and then was so bold as to ask "are you allowed to drink while pregnant?" She said her doctor told her it was okay to have a drink every now and then, and it was even okay to have a glass of wine every day.       WTF? Really? I don't know if I would want to risk something like that.

Last night I took a pregnancy test that was blurry, and when I looked at it this morning it was positive! My fiance ran out and got two more tests. I took one, and it was negative :( However, I still think I'm pregnant!      Within the past several weeks I have had different pregnancy symptoms. The ones I've had this week (the week I should have gotten my period-- I am 4 days late) are runny nose, sore throat, lower back pain, and insomnia-- I have trouble getting to sleep, and then when I wake up I just want to sleep more and can't seem to get out of bed in the mornings! I pee a ton as well. Yesterday I had cramping, and today I feel like I have a swirling, warm feeling in my lower abdomen.       I am planning on taking another test soon, within the end of the week. If it's still negative and I don't have my period, I'm going to the doctor!      Any advice or experiences are welcomed! :) Thank you and pray for me and my fiance!

The only problem is if I start it this month, the week I will be ovulating is the same week my hubby is supposed to be out of town for work. He said it's no big deal to tell work he can't go..  So it's either that, or we wait until next cycle to start the clomid.    I posted this question earlier but the couple people that answered just said "it's up to you".. The thing is, I don't know what to do! That's why I'm asking what OTHER people would do in this situation!  Thanks :)

My cycle is usually 30 days long but the last ocuple of months it has changed up a little.  One month it was 42 days and the other about 35 days.  So this month I was not exactly sure where it should fall but it started on day 35 according to my charting, but when I started it was alway just spotting.  I thought it would get heavier b/c it always does and I usually cramp really bad.  This time Ijust wore a liner and probaly did not even have to.  I spotted light pink/orange/brown for a week.  Now I have continued to spot for 4 more days but now it is just brown.  I took one test during spotting but it was negative.  I am confused b/c I do have other symptoms but I had the one negative test.  My period has never been like this before since I have started and I am 31.  It always starts light and gets heavy.  I have been trying to lose weight lately but I am going at about the healthy 2 lbs. a week and never had this issue before when dieting.  Any advice, suggestions, etc. Thanks for any help in advanced.

20090128142715AAzPLIk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	This is getting to be to much for me!?	Since my dad left and my mom had to go from a stay at home mom to working from 8:30 to 5:00. I was in the fourth grade when this happened and my little brother was in second. Since then, I have been making sure my brother is up and ready in the morning which is difficult because he has OCD with feet (long story). I have to stay home and watch him without getting paid. Now that is has been awhile since my dad has left my mom is starting to date again. She has at least 3 dates a week. I can't go out with my friends or anyone else unless my brother comes along. It really isn't fair. When I have friends over and I'm constantly telling him what to do, my friends ask why and say that it isn't my job. They are right. I have to clean up after him and I can't take it anymore! He always says he cleans and does this and that but it's really me! My mom believes him too. Today, because I was telling him to shovel the sidewalk like he was supposed to,he kept throwing snow at me. So when I went inside he started punching me and pulling my hair. I swear he is mental! I have told my mom this repeatedly and she doesn't listen because he is her baby. What else am I supposed to do? He always needs somewhere here with him because he is so immature. I'm not his mom! I shouldn't be doing all this! I skipped 5th grade and went to 6th grade because I was so smart and got all A+'s. But this year I almost failed my first semester!

My boyfriend told me that his uncle told him a girl can't get pregnant three days after her period is over. I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend but he didn't ejaculate inside me. Still, he said even if he did I couldn't get pregnant because this is the third day since my period has been over. I started my period Jan. 20 and it ended Jan. 25 so this would be the third day my periods been over, i just wanted to make sure if it's true a girl can't get pregnant THREE DAYS after her period is over.

20090128142604AASg822	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Trying for a baby....does this sound like pregnancy, an early miscarriage or something else?	I have PCOS and irregular periods. Had a menstrual cycle about maybe a month and a half to two months ago. Had unprotected sex about 3-4 weeks ago, and again (messing around without full penetration, but still unprotected with about 1 1/2" of internal contact...sorry if TMI lol) about two weeks ago. Now cramps, and brown spotting. Cramps have been for about 4 days now. Spotting is light and now turning into dark brown soft type clots in clear mucus. Still not heavy. Sort of have pressure in rectum and light-medium cramps on right side, but it's been about 5 days now and no period. I've been very overly moody, from fine one minute to furious the next. Nipples are sore...but only the very very tip of them. ( I have small breasts and they never are sore prior to periods). I have been having more frequent bowel movements and they are somewhat soft. Been sneezing noticeable a lot but I don't have allergies. At home test was negative this afternoon. Does this sound like a miscarriage? I don't have regular periods, so I cannot tell you when I was ovulating, or when I am due for one. If it were a miscarriage, would the home test be negative since it's been five days of mild-medium cramping with only slight clottage? One last thing that I don't know if is related....but about two weeks ago I had white mucus inside that I thought might have been a yeast infection....but now that is gone and now this. Do you think this is healthy pregnancy or a miscarriage? I'm 23 years old and have never had anything like this before. I do not want to see my gyno for a blood test yet as he is disapproving of my premarital sex and knows my mother outside of work...I do not want her finding out. Thank you for your help I'm a little freaked out...but I do want a baby...me and my fiance have always wanted children!!!

20090128141521AAwqrKU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it safe to have Mono sodium glutamate when pregnant.?	My Aunt and my friend claim that they were told by their Dr.s not to eat anything that has MSG in it although when I mention this to any of my other friends they think I'm crazy. Although I don't recall my Dr. specifically mentioning not to eat anything with it I have convinced myself as well as my boyfriend that it's bad for me and the baby.    Over the passed four months I have obsessed over making sure that I don't consume anything with MSG in it but it's so hard to avoid because it's in EVERYTHING! Frozen dinners, Ramen noodles, Cheese puffs, Chinese food, Brazilian food... seriously, everything.    My friend's keep telling me that this is the time to eat anything I want and I know that certain things are ok in moderation, but every time I give in and get ready to eat something with MSG in it I can't do it. I start feeling so guilty and imagining myself in the future with a baby with some disability, regretting eating food with MSG in it.    What are some of your experiences with MSG? Do you remember your Dr. specifically telling you to stay away from it?

I am a little worried, need some other moms or preggers to help put my mind at ease...      I will be 9 weeks tomorrow.   2 weeks ago, I have a small amount of spotting the day after my b/f and I had sex, it was only when I wiped (tmi)(sorry) and only lasted a day. I went to the ER, they were rude, but basically said if I was not bleeding heavily or cramping, not to worry.   I have to pee every 5 minutes, and I am not exxagerating, and still have sore/full breats.    Tried to hear the heartbeat yesterday at midwife appt. but could not, a little early. I have a sonogram scheduled for tomorrw. But now am worried that maybe its eptopic, (I have not had and pain though) or spotting since that day....am hungry ALLLL the time....seems fine I guess, my clothes are fitting snugger, but I have not gained any weight yet....      So....reading internet blogs and all, it looks like I am okay...but...still can't help but worry a little.      Any advice/words of encouragement???

20090128085817AAIFgRG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How accurate is an ultrasound in predicting a due date?	I am a little confused and worried! I am unaware of when my last menstrual period was...But what I am aware of is when I had intercourse. I am sure that I had intercourse some time between July 1-5. Also, August 10 and again on August 22. I had an ultrasound done December 18 to find out my due date and they told me that I was 19 weeks and 5 days from conception (not my LMP). That would mean I would have conceived on August 2, which is pretty well off all of the dates I had intercourse. I am worried because I was with someone different in July than I was in August. Please don't think I am promiscuous. I am just in a great deal of stress and I would like to figure out an answer without having a prenatal paternity test.
20090128090409AAGN84o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Curious: when did you feel you were ready for a baby?	All the women around me are pregnant or already have kids. I'm 29, my husband is 34. We own our home, we both have stable jobs, and I am in the beginning of graduate school with about 2 years left. We've been married for a year and half and the pressure to start a family is on. I am hoping to be out of credit card debt in a year and a half. I keep telling people we can't have a baby until we're financially settled, but I look around and everyone I know who is pregnant or parenting is WAY worse off than we are financially (single, renting, poor, no health insurance, spouse is laid off, no plan for child care, etc). They answer me by saying, "you'll never be prepared financially." My concern is waiting until I'm 32 and hubby's 38 and we're still not ready. I know for sure that my husband will NEVER be ready unless it just happens--he'll never plan it with me, that's just him. Is time for me to just stop taking the pill?

I'm 22 weeks with fraternal twins and I'm finding it hard to distinguish which twin is which when they kick.      I'm having a boy and a girl and the girl moves from the right side to using her brother as a pillow, lying on top of him!       My question is, how do I know if it is him or her kicking as she moves around all over the place and kicks him in the head a lot?      I feel what I think is her kicking towards my ribs but at the same time as I feel that kick i feel a kick or nudge by (or mostly in!) my bladder. Could this be from her kicking him in the head and him bouncing off my bladder lol? Or are they just kicking at the same time?      I don't know how I'm supposed to know they are both ok by doing kick counts when I don't know which is which and it feels like he's not moving at all down there!!
20090225140454AAFDsax	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	At what age did your child begin daycare?	Before I gave birth I place my daughter on a list at the local churches daycare.  I was #16 on the list.  Because I'm unsure of when I will actually be called, I'm going Tuesday to talk with another lady about her child care services.  She has an opening now, but I really didn't want to put her in daycare until about 6 months old.   My mother-in-law keeps my little girl now (she's 11 weeks old) but I know that once she becomes mobile, that my MIL won't be able to keep her any longer.  I really hate to put her in daycare now, but I'm not sure that anyone will be available once I NEED the services.      How old was your child when they began attending childcare centers?  How did they fair?           My heart just breaks knowing she's not with someone I know personally.  The only up-side is that the daycare I'm meeting with Tuesday is only 3 miles from work and It's a small daycare.  No more than 12 children.        Just needing some reassurance for Tuesday....Also, what are some things I will need to ask.      And what all do you pack for daycare and how much of all of those things?

They look like when you get the chills, but are more "random" dots than that.  Some are flesh-colored and some are pink.  Her skin isn't swollen, just bumpy.  I haven't changed any foods, laundry soap, new clothes or anything... what could it be?  Have tried to call the doc, but no call back yet.  I'm just trying to decide if I should take her in...

How can she think gagging is funny?  I hate gagging.  LOL.   Should I just let her do it or try to stop this?

20090128101442AAKIwtL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	9 weeks prego tomorrow....a little worried...?	Question on possibility of problem at 9 weeks....?   Okay, so I am prego....:) yay!   I am a little worried, need some other moms or preggers to help put my mind at ease...      I will be 9 weeks tomorrow.   2 weeks ago, I have a small amount of spotting the day after my b/f and I had sex, it was only when I wiped (tmi)(sorry) and only lasted a day, (first was red, then orange-ish, then pink) . I went to the ER, they were rude, but basically said if I was not bleeding heavily or cramping, not to worry.   I have to pee every 5 minutes, and I am not exagerating, and still have sore/full breasts, only nauseated on occasion.    Tried to hear the heartbeat yesterday at midwife appt. but could not, a little early. I have a sonogram scheduled for tomorrow and I am super excited about it, but nervous too. I am worried that maybe its eptopic, (I have not had any pain though, just the usual pregnancy cramps, and pulling etc.) or spotting since that day....am hungry ALLLL the time....seems fine I guess, my clothes are fitting snugger, but I have not gained any weight yet....      So....reading internet blogs and all, it looks like I am okay...but...still can't help but worry a little....okay maybe alot.      Any advice/words of encouragement???

The other day she and a friend (also meant to be my friend) told me i smelt and named lots of horrible smelly things that i smelt like ( i didnt even smell)      Last year on the way home theres a place Leah and friends would hang round and ***** about me and give me evils when I walked past and now this year im scared to walk past incase they're there. Today no one was there but in the house near it (where another of Leahs friend house is) leahs friend just stared at me.      its making me cry and feel sad and i dont want to go to school and I hate walking home on my own.

20090225085625AALSBqG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I need as many answers as possible, going crazy wondering?	Ok, so this is kind of long and I do apologize but I am in serious need of advice, experience, or ANYTHING helpful.....   I am now 17 days late for my period. About a week before my period was due(maybe a few days less) I started having cramps (normal) and having waves of nausea throughout the day. My head started hurting at random points of the day but only for a short amount of time (most of the time) I got (am still) moody as hell, my face broke out, and I was just plain exhausted. Naturally I thought that my period was coming but....here I sit almost 20 something days later and still no period!! I am still having the cramps and occasionally the nausea and headaches, but now (and this started about a week/week and a half ago) my breasts feel TENDER (especially on the sides) I have blue veins and tiny tiny pinkish/purplish veins on my breasts. And I feel like I am catching a cold but it is only in my nose (which is stuffy) and my throat (which is mostly just scratchy and only a little swollen). Then yesterday and today the muscle in my lower abdomen (bellow my belly button) feels so sore (like I did crunches all day the day before, but I acctually spent most of the day on my couch because I was so tired). I have taken like 5 pregnancy tests and all came back negative. I know that my best bet is to go to the DR. but I am having difficulties finding one that I can afford without insurance (I am waiting for my insurance to come into affect) I am basically trying to figure out what is going on. I keep thinking "it's just my period coming" but then I still haven't gotten one, so I wanted to get some oppinions from other people. Do you think that my period will come sometime soon or do you think I might be pregnant and it is just not showing up? I haven't been under stress and nothing has changed in my life, so I do not know what is causing my period to be so late. I have had it be at most 4 days late but never more. Should I just wait until next month and see if my period comes or go ahead and go to the DR? I just need some advice I am going absolutely CRAZY!!! I just want one or the other (a period or a positive!!)

20090225083241AAAtyFB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Will my (almost) 4 yo dd have social problems if?	My (almost) 4 yo dd has not yet gone to preschool, has only had a once-a-week ballet class, but I intend to enroll her in preschool this fall for a 4K program.  The problem is most of the non-religious programs are full-day M-F.  I cannot see how it would be right to enroll her in a Christian program since we are not Christians.  But I can tell she needs to be socially trained and guided by a teacher, because with her ballet classmates, she is very bossy.  She will sometimes ignore the teacher because she is so busy making the other girls pay attention.  And with her baby brother and a younger playmate, she insists on running the show.  She is very intelligent, but also very tempermental and demanding.  Will she have problems making friends at preschool, and is it too much to go right into an all-day program?      BTW - I am a SAHM, so she has never been to daycare either, and her only babysitters have been her grandparents.

I thought it was O.K because my period was due in just 4 days (although I am usually about two days late) and therefore I would not be ovulating. I know I was not ovulating because of the texture of my discharge.

So honestly (and don't just exaggurate to be nasty because it is not effective) what is the chance I am pregnant?

When her parents found out, they told her that it was a shame she was born into their family and that they embarrassed her beyond belief. How could you say that to your daughter? She hasn't talked to them since. I've tried to get her to talk to her parents and get her parents to talk to her but they say that it just isn't going to happen.

I have the original packaging from the bottles, but it doesn't say anything about BPA.

20090225085257AAKm0L5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Coughing and Vomiting After Waking Up?	It never fails.  After I wake up from sleeping at night or even a nap, after  some time I will start coughing until I throw up.  At first I thought I was getting cat hair (my boyfriend's house is full of cat hair due to 3 fuzzy cats) stuck in my throat at night and trying to dislodge it.  However at my pet free house, I still have the issue.  I've noticed this recent time that my throat feels dry and mildly tight right before I throw up.  I have never had asthma so I'm not to sure what a tight, closing throat feels like.  I've changed my position from laying down to reclining to sleep, eaten crackers and had ginger ale before I start coughing, and even quickly hopped in the shower to see if perhaps the humidity would make my throat more moist.  Nothing works.  I am only about 6 weeks pregnant, and I'm really hoping I don't have to throw up 1-3 times a day for the rest of my pregnancy.  Any ideas?  Thank you!

He would not cooperate with getting out of the car, going inside, going upstairs, mad because he couldn't watch TV, blew another fit, so we put him in his room not to come out for 15 minutes, but thats not all.      the 15 minutes he had to be doing absolutely nothing. No playing, making any noise whatsoever, no talking, no stepping a foot out of his room, no walking in his room. He has to choose one spot and stay there for 15 minutes So far his time has started and stopped 5-6 times. He's still in his room. Is this too harsh?

I have this friend, and I kinda think that she's just pretending to be my friend.   Reasons:   -She says I can't sit with certain people at lunch/on the bus.   -She tries to control me.   -She only talks to me when she has something to tell me. (What she got for Christmas, who she's going out with)   -On her pics of her friends on myspace, she has pics of her other friends that are recent. The one she has of me is from 1 year ago. (We do go to the same school, and live down the street from each other)   -She's always talking about how great Kristen is.   -She always go to the movies and the mall with her other friends. I'm only asked if someone she's going with asks me.   -She blew me off at Halloween AND Christmas. Halloween I had a party, I asked her to come before Kristen asked her to go to the mall with her. Christmas, she doesn't celebrate it. So I asked if she wanted to go to the movies. She said no, Kristen and her was going. (She didn't ask if I wanted to go with them)   -When I'm hanging out with Jordon, she always comes over and flirts with him. For the past month, she has been teasing me and saying we are boyfriend-and girlfriend. (We're not)   I feel like I'm always the person that's just there.   Do you know what I mean?   She's been my 'friend' for the last 2 years.   I really didn't think about getting to know other people, so I only know a couple of other people from my school.   When I do make a new friend, she starts talking to them. If it's a guy, she gets them to like her.   I've tried hanging out with other people, but she always comes over ans starts talking to them. Making them ignore me.   What should I do?   I really need the advice because I go back to school tomorrow.   (Snow day for the past 2 days)

What if your kid wanted to be naked in the house, I mean like only in his/her room though?  Would you really care if they want to be naked within their room?

It's not like they are in the room with me, I'm all alone in there, nobody is going to see me.  When I do leave my room, I just put on a robe or a towel to go out in the house.  My parent's don't like it though, they want me to wear clothes.  Well I don't want to wear clothes, being naked is so much more comfortable to me.  It's not like I'm walking around the house naked or anything, I'm only naked in my room with the door locked.  So why do you think my parents care so much about this?

20090128150024AARRCWW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Should I try to find a different ride to the gym? ?	Hi, I currently train at a MMA gym. I go Monday-Saturday. I get a ride from my moms friend and son. The deal is I pay their registration/sign up fees and membership monthly IF they give me rides everyday. They have stood me up 3 times, no just stood me up as if they were doing something else- they were going to the gym but NOT taking me! Then they just all around stopped taking me while we were paying for their membership still because we had to give a month notice to cancel it. Now our gym merged with another gym and somehow we became friends again and started the deal again (rides for membership). I can not stand these people the son is mean to me. And now they are asking for gas money! Shouldn't the nearly $300 my mom payed to sign them up cover that? And what about $108 we payed on the first of january for their membership? When we agreed there was never mention of gas money? Is this messed up? Should I try to find another ride? Should I ask an instructor at the gym if they have anyone who can give me rides and I'll pay them gas money?? Is that awkard to ask? The people at the gym are really nice by the way. What would you do?? Thanks guys

20090128115222AAfpjUq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breast-feeding and cereal?	My daughter is now 6 months old and has been given the go-ahead to eat rice cereal mixed with breast milk by the pediatrician. She seems to enjoy eating cereal provided that I feed her the cereal first and then breast-feed. It's almost as though she's full after breast-feeding and does not want to eat cereal after that. I was wondering how much cereal should I be feeding her at one sitting? I'm mixing her three tablespoons of cereal to two tablespoons of breast-milk. I know that she is still hungry after eating this amount since she's chomping on the spoon as I'm only introducing solids into her diet at this time. Is she supposed to be full after eating cereal alone? Am I supposed to finish her meal by breast-feeding (which is what I do now)? I know that she can usually drink about 6-7 ounces of breast milk.

20090128124654AAnPsKm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What level of hcg do doctor's urine tests detect?	I have taken 3 pregnancy tests(all positive), and I'm 3 days late. I know I'm pregnant. My husband is in the military, and to get a referral to an OBGYN you have to go into the clinic and get a positive with them first. I went in on Monday, and the test was negative. The nurse told me that the hormone levels just weren't high enough, and I should come back later in the week. Today, I took a digital test that I know detects at a higher level, it was positive too. I guess I want to know if the test at the doctor's will be positive now...or( if anyone knows) what level it detects the pregnancy hormone. Thanks!

20090128114228AAJVR5b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Vacutainer Tubes - Question?	When using Vacutainer Tubes, I understand there is a vacuum within the tube. So I have two questions:      1. If someone opened the tube BEFORE the draw, thus exposing the vacuum and whatever serum present, does this damage the Vacutainer's vacuum effect to draw blood?      2. I know a holder can be re-used, but in clinics and such, is it standard practice to reuse Vacutainer TUBES? I'd figure since the vacuum had been priorly exposed to air/environment, that this is not possible.

20090128150537AAQud4W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How can I get my daughter to testify in court?	My family is in a serious dilemma. My 14-year-old daughter was the only witness to a rape and murder in our community. They have caught the sick freak who did it and they have to have my daughter testify in court.      She absolutely refuses to, because she's too afraid. We've tried everything. She won't even do voice-changers or anonymous video testifies. Our lawyer is out of options on what to do.      We are out of options on what to do. She was subpoenaed to appear in court last Friday, but ignored it and went to a friend's house.      The police told her that if she keeps refusing to testify in any way, then she will be held in juvenile hall unless she agrees to testify. I told them that they can't threaten her like that, but they said that it's the only way that they can put the man in jail.      We have begged, pleaded, cajoled, and other things to get her to testify, but she won't. The anonymous video testify and voice-changers won't work. She refuses to talk about it in any way.      How can I get her to testify?      Would it be best for her to spend some time in juvie until she agrees?      What should I do?

20090128114752AASPrHw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 15 month old daughter has had a runny nose for 6 days. Should I take her to the doctors?	Her nose has been running clear, she has no other symptoms, no cough, no fever. But she hasn't been eating very much in the past 3 days except breastfeeding or sleeping very well at night. At first I thought she just had a cold b/c her cousins came over a few days before her runny nose started and one of them was just getting over a cold. But now I'm starting to wonder if she has a cold. I can't stand this, her nose has been like constantly running for 6 days. She is teething and getting her molars but she has already got 2 and her nose didn't run with them. She has only been sick one other time with a cold and it only lasted a couple days. What could it be and how can I help her?
20090128112554AAyQR7H	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I really need some advice on if I am doing the wrong thing... or right thing... ?	When I found out I was pregnant, I was 7 weeks, at approx, 15 weeks i found out that I have had gall stones, And to day as I am almost 22 weeks, It is now infected. My Obgyn, says she is totally agenst any surgery. She then directed me to a surgeon, He said Yes I NEED the surgery, or Baby AND I will not make it (as in death if your not following.). I am so scared. I feel horrible I have to put my baby at risk, to save my own life, I would rather hold out and at least try, then hurting my baby. My fiance, said I have to get it done cause he doesn't want to lose both of us. Which I am in Mother mode, and am willing to rick my life if my baby will make it. The pain from all of this actually does make me some days, resent my child, since, I can not move, I can not clean my own house. My fiance actually has taken over so much, even always being there to help me up, to walk or anything. ... Honestly after this pain, I dont think I will need to be having the epidural, this pain is much worse then labor, I have had one child and do know..lol...  the pain is bad, but worth my babys health. Then again I dont want to die (there for my baby dies as well) for being stupid and not getting it done.       Basically, am I wrong for feeling like I should hold out, I should do what it takes, to make sure my baby isn't  going to be put in any harm.    Or is my fiance right that I should get this done,  i am so worried about my baby. We never thought we could get preg. And we are so excited now that we are.       Does anyone know the statistics on surgery during pregnancy? I have tried to Google to find some, none i can see....      Input is greatly appreciated!!!!!

I've been having mild cramping for about the last 2 weeks and this morning I woke up with a mild stabbing pain in the side of my abdomen (about 2 inches below my ribs on the left side). It only hurts when I stand-up or sit (basically whenever I have to bend at the waist). Was this a symptom of ectopic pregnancy for you? Also, how do they diagnose an ectopic pregnancy?

20090128115521AANqZhM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I even be concerned with meeting his kids' mother?	I've been with my man for 4 years now.  He has 2 daughters that have been around me for 3 1/2 yrs.  They enjoy spending time with their father and myself, although it's not that often (maybe 3 times a month).  I have never had any problems with his kid's mother, and we have never met or even spoken over the phone.  Whenever the girls' are with us, they are always with either both of us or myself because their father and I have lived together for 3 1/2 yrs (getting married next year).  My man and his kid's mother do not speak often, whenever they do, it is because either him or another one of his family members has made contact with the girls' mother to see if the girls' might be able to come over for the weekend or what have you.  He pays $750.00 per month in child support.          Personally, I would like to meet her so that we can ensure that we have a good working relationship to pave the road ahead for the kids.  My man would like me to really jump into the "mother" role with them, and i have expressed to him that i would love to have the freedom to be able to pick up the phone and call her to see if i can take the girls here or there.  I know plenty of women who have wonderful relationships with their ex's baby's mother and it makes things so much more comfortable.          I am just puzzled as to why she has not asked to meet me. He says it's probably because she knows that he won't have them around anyone that's not good for them.  she has dropped them off at my place a couple of times for the weekend.  she never gets out of the car.  I would introduce myself to her, however, i am afraid of it looking or seeming confrontational or that I am throwing myself in her face.  i also find it a bit rude to drop your kids' at another womans place for 3 years and not show an interest in getting to know that woman a little bit.  So, would anyone else see this as being rude, and should i even care if she ever meets me or not.

For example if:    You have unprotected sex again after taking Levonelle One Step"      However it does not go into any more detail than this. Does anyone know if it is meant that if a man ejaculates into a woman after she has taken the pill it will not work..       Or if it is simply the motions of sex that will cause it not to work - ejaculation unnecessary.      And why is this?      Thankyou.

20090128150853AAhJpD8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	8 Week old baby that won't stay alseep?	I just recently had my son on December 1st of 2008. He was a very good baby. Always slept, never cried unless I was changing his diaper or his clothes, maybe sometimes with a bath. Recently about 2 weeks ago, he hasn't been sleeping more than 15 minutes for a nap. He will sleep if I'm holding him, but he will immediately wake up when I put him down. I've tried a bath, bottle, changing him, putting a blanket on or off of him just in case he's hot or cold. I have even went out and bought him the womb bear, but it seems not to work either. He sleeps great through the night. He'll wake up at about 2:30, then 5:00, and then back up at 9:00. But every time that I put him down in a swing or in his chair that vibrates, he fusses and cries. Is there anyone that can give me a solution to this problem? I haven't even been able to clean my house without him fussing. He uses a pacifier, also. But there are times when he'll just spit out. Please, someone help me? lol. =] Thank you.

It's like vitex which everyone trusts doesn't work...but things that hardly anyone trusts do work.    Geritol complete help alot of people become pregnant...some people I know and I know their isn't really proof, but that is because they really havn't studied it much.

20090128151639AAwAG2V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do my best friends always dump me at the last minute?	With one of them I can understand why she does it. She works from 7:30 to 4 and wakes up at 4:45, so she's always tired and she lies in on the weekend cos she's tired.      Whilst the other one goes to a grammar school now and she's always dumping me at the last minute to go to parties (where all she does is sit there and talk to people she doesn't dance, drink or anything) The thing is when she dumps me last minute it's usually the night we go to this youth club thing in her village which I have to make plans in advance to go because it starts at 7:30 and my mum doesn't get home until like 6:30 and if I go I have to leave home at 7. So usually my mum can't stay behind at work and do her planning for the next week so I loose out on spending time with her at the weekend because she has to plan for the next week. I've brought it up with my friend but she ignores it.      She's also got a boyfriend so she spends all her time with him and always bitches to me about him and he does the same thing to me. When they are around me they make me feel like a third wheel and they know it, they also kiss, etc in front of me when they know I hate it. They've got me feeling and thinking they only do it because I don't have a boyfriend so they are rubbing it in.

20090128151423AAXDdZE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Alternate meanings for the name Marie?	We just found out that baby  2 is a girl and we're wanting to name her either Kaylee Marie or Kaylee Jo-Marie. Marie is a family name on both sides and not just a "filler" as some would say, but I hate the most common meaning, "bitter".    Do you know of any other origins and meanings for Marie??  Or know of a website where you can find multiple origins and meanings for the same name?    Thanks in advance!!
