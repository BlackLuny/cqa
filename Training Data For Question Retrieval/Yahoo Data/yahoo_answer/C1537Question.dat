20090226160451AAf32Tt	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Is it weird to feel like this......?	There's this guy in my English class, and he always tries to talk to me after class, but I DON'T WANT HIM TO. He always approaches me, and talks to me, and I hate being rude to people, so I reply to him. I tried waiting in class a bit longer to see if he'd go away, but he came closer to my desk, and he actually walked out the door and waited for me to come outside. Then, he just pounced with his approach. Ugh..it sickens me, because I try my best to avoid him and every other guy.      And, the other thing is, he's really bad in English, and has a really thick Indian accent, and I get freaked out every time he approaches me. And, today, he asked me for my Facebook name, and I stood there thinking for like 5 minutes, and told him I'd give it to him when I see him again, but I was like "WHY DIDN'T I JUST SAY I DON'T HAVE A FACEBOOK?!" Ughh. It's like bugging the heck out of me, because I've been trying my best for the past month to not talk to guys at all.      And, he has become my latest dilemma. Should I just tell him that I don't really talk to guys...? I feel sorry for him, when I look at him, because he practically struggles to get through the class, and I feel horrible when I offend people.      What do I do? =/

20090226161739AAnlAdW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, do you think that history has just as much evidence as science, if not more, that god isn't real?	If you just take a simple history course of the world before 1800, then I think if you look at all the facts and everything with religion in history, that it's enough to conclude that religion was created by the human mind and as a great way of power. Whenever I sit in on a history course I just can't believe all of the religious people around me who just completely ignore it! I'm always so tempted to just blurting out the things that just destroy religion, but I don't want to come off as an ashole.    Don't you agree with me that history is just as much evidence of god being completely false? It just astounds me of how ignorant people can be of the facts about religion that history can provide!

20090226161012AAdWXOr	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramdanites?...........this is a serious question.?	First of all, salaam to all and to some hi,       This is my first question, that I am asking on this forum.    Do you think this section needs something of a moderator? I mean seriously, where is this all going? People are posting anything and everything at comes in their mind, without a second thought.      I know its ok to post something different, say a joke, some socialising activity from time to time, but the rate it’s increasing, there will be nothing left of an Islamic dialogue platform here.       I am not saying that all full Islamic questions and answers, ‘all works and no game makes a person dull’, hence I am not totally against those socialising.      Now seriously,    -why would some one post a song lyrics to be completed?   -why would some one ask the ladies opinion of males being canines here? There is the single and dating section, where the asker would get proper response.      My question: is there a need a moderator here?       Have a nice day all. Remember this is moslem section, others might fly by just to see how the moslems behave.   Peace.      -----extra info------------   some great contributors are thinking of leaving this section due to these increasing of irrelevant postings, without whom this forum would be just another room, trust me on this.

I have a friend who is very very quiet and I bought her around my other friends and they made rude comments towards her, but yet they called her rude because she only spoke but did not feel comfortable around them. I know women can be very rude and cruel, especially to someone that they don't know (especially another female). I think it's nothing wrong with no one being quiet b/c I am the same way but once I get to know a person they find out that I am fun and loyal. Any answers, even if it's negative.

But then how do I say that? I don't wanna come off like I have problems with that person...

20090226163203AAzbJ0h	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	PLEASE HELP! In love with my friend....?	I became friends with a girl when i was 15 and she was 16 and we started to hang out a lot. I told her I was bi one night and she was shocked but was ok with it. Then one night we had been drinking a lot and she kissed me. At first I was like wtf!! But then one thing led to another and we..you know! This then went on for quite a while but it was always when we had had a drink. Then when we were sober we wouldn't ever talk about it. Sometimes, it seemed we would only be getting alcohol so as we could be together, because to be drunk somehow made it ok.      But, after a while she started to see a boy. She still didnt stop things with me but she didnt stop things with him either. Sometimes I thought she was trying to make me jealous. But after a while me and her stopped being intimate, I dont really know why. And she started seeing him more and more. I was heartbroken. But we stayed friends. I was convinced I was in love with her and I couldn't believe what she was doing to me. So I cut her out of my life, I stopped going out with her, I made new friends and tried to forget her but I couldn't. I thought about her every day and it was so frustrating. I really wanted to tell her how I felt but I was to scared of what she'd say.      After 5 months, she got in contact again and wanted to see me. And me being an idiot agreed. We went out a few times and it seemed like she was trying to rekindle what we had had but I wasn't completely sure. She was still seeing this boy aswell although she would constantly say she was only with him for his money and she didnt like him.       Eventually she broke it off with him and me and her became best friends again. We spent every minute of every day together and although nothing happened it felt as though the connection was still there. She would always touch me in innapropriate places and then say she was messing. I was more confused than ever. She would tell me that whenever she left my house she would feel sick at the thought of leaving me. Whatever that means.      BUT...once again we drifted apart because i got a job and that meant we had less time to spend together. I asked her out a few times but she always had plans so eventually I stopped asking.      Now, she is seeing another boy who she used to say she liked a lot. But she keeps texting me asking me to go out with her and I'm trying to ignore them.      When we are together it is like we are the same person and can always tell what the other is going to say and stuff like that. I cant imagine being like that with anyone else!      She is the first person I have ever felt like this about and I'm now 17 and she's 18 and it's gone on to long.      Please someone help !!

I am considering getting a treatment called "dermabrasion" which does scar removal along with chemical peels and blue light therapy. What it does it remove a layer of skin and makes skin smooth and removes the scars.    Would this be considered haram because it's for cosmetic purposes? I really don't want to live with scars all my life and it  damages my self esteem. Thank you

If the Eucharist is either literally the body of Christ or represents the body of Christ in some spiritual way and that it bestows the grace of God upon its recipients wouldn't you think it should be made available to anyone who wants it?? that these churches should be anxious to make all people recipients of a gift of a loving God?

20090226173848AAGnVgR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are many atheists hypocrites?	They will tell you not to judge others; But they will judge you, from the moment you say you're a Christian.      They say they need proof to believe in God; Yet there is no proof for the Big Bang, but they choose to put their FAITH in the magic of a self created Big Bang.      They say the Bible is man made, so it is unreliable; Yet every theory they quote is man made, and they not only want you to believe its reliable, but they try their best to present their theories as facts.       They get offended if you share your beliefs; Yet they love to preach why they don't believe in God, and why believers shouldn't believe.      They love to insult Christianity; But if you point out the flaw of another religion, you're a close-minded Bigot.      (Please note the above applies to most atheists, not all. I have friends who are atheists, but not like the ones on R&S)      ------------------------      "The more I study science, the more I believe in God."      "I believe in a Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists"      "God always takes the simplest way"      "When the solution is simple, God is answering"      "Science without religion is lame"      "In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views."      -Albert Einstein      What do you think? I'm just like, curious?

20090226172720AAfCqH2	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	What would an entirely Islamic world do?	I just began thinking about what the world would be like if it was run by the Islamic laws (the way it is supposed to be run, not some unique, misinterpreted way some people run it)      Example:      1. No world hunger- If every single person donated 2.5% of their salary to the poor people in the world... world hunger would be eradicated      2. Virtually no crime- With the strict laws of the Shariah, crime would inevitably drop down to non-existence      3. Economy would thrive- No interest and use of collateral instead would prevent banks from having collapses that they had recently. In fact, Islamic banks are growing 10-15% every year, and are very popular in today's time      These are also inter-related, since ending world hunger may decrease theft, etc.
20090226174840AAQeXFw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Rumor has it I am bi.I'm most certainly not.Should I be bothered? Even "friends" believe the rumor.What to do?	ok, here's the thing:  It is no secret that many years ago, ( 9,to be exact) I lived in Utah,and almost all of my friends, male and female, were either gay,bi or yes, transgendered.   Well, my downstairs neighbor, has alot of "adopteds" and most of them are either bi-sexual,or gay.   Her own daughters, two are bi,the other two are straight.   Well, it gets worse.   My own closest friend,a woman in her 50's implied that she was very straight,and unlike "some " people, she din't swing the "other " way. I let it slide,as she changed the subject rather quickly.   Two weeks later,i asked her what she meant by it and she tried to say :" nothing.i was just babbling." i caught her in the lie and told her so.   She admitted that there was a rumor going around,that I was bi-sexual,suince my own very best friend was bi,and I am the product of a gay man and a bisexual woman.   It gets worse.   I asked her where she heard the rumor from,and she said " the maintenence man."    There is only ONE maintenence man here in the complex I live in.   And he is a known gossip.  In fact, he is worse that the women here!    To add to this, my neighbor's "adopted" was jokeing with me,and was in a good mood,for a change.she is terminally ill, with a brain tumor,and when she is happy,we all are happy.   "Nikki" was making funnies and came up to me and pretended to hump me and said" I'll leave Jessie ( her girlfriend) if you leave Eric,and we'll go to Vegas,hunny!"    I had to laugh,as that as it was comical.   Shortly after that,is when the rumors started.   I have a feeling that my downstairs neighbor started it.   That doesn't bother me,as if i do anything about it,then i will add fuel to the fire.      Sooo, what do I do about this?

We're not really close friends, but we do see each other a few times a year,  and she told me (in tears) that she had lost her mother a few weeks ago.

My fiance is a great guy but when we first started dating there was a lot of things that he learned to change when it comes to hygeine. For example, he used to go like three days without brushing his teeth. After I started dating him I told him nicely that he should do it more often for his oral health, and he does.      Lately when we have sex it smells like poop sometimes. I know its not me as I wipe very carefully after pooping and also use tucks wipes to make sure there is no poop left. But I know from doing his laundry that he doesnt wipe well because often in his boxers there is a poop stain.      Last night I asked him if before we had sex we could both shower to make sure we are nice and clean, but he said no. I then asked him if he could just wipe that area with my tucks before and he said no, he was offended. He said I HAVE NO DESIRE TO. So I said Oh I forgot it was all about YOUR desires.      Anyways, last night he ended up having a shower anyway but what about in the future. He works long hours and he is not going to want to shower before sex all the time. Nor will he use tucks. And I dont think it would go over very well if I had a talk with him about his wiping techniques.      What should I do about this. I like making love to him but I hate the poop smell! IT doesnt happen every time but it does sometimes and it is NOT romantic!

20090226173207AADO5TU	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Can you wear socks after performing wudu?	After wudu, can you put your socks back on (in the case that you don't do wudu with socks on), and pray with them, or must you wait after praying before putting them back on?      Because the feet is one of the seven spots (along with forehead and nose) that have to touch the ground, that's what brought my confusion of whether or not it's allowed.  I've seen many people at the masjid I attend pray with socks on, though I'm not sure if that's because they performed wudu with socks on or without and put them back on.      Out of preference, even though I heard it's possible to do wudu while wearing socks, I don't like to because it's less convenient for me.  Though I'd also like to know what groups (sunni, shia, or the like) believe it's okay and which don't.      Oh, and what if you're praying out in public, while you're wearing shoes?  Is shoes (or gloves even) allowed while praying?

He is actually not my uncle but i am consider him my uncle   Here is my story    I have 9 sisters 4 older 4 younger and my twin sister and one more sister on the way. I have to share a room with my twin sister and my 6-year-old sister. I don't care we have a big room. My twin and I are not 13 yet.   We all go to a private Christian school. We all eat lunch together. I allow them to give me makeovers we get board. They done this for 5-6 years. We live out in the country. 45MI NSS from our school. They are nice about putting makeup on me. They make me look good. I wear there clothes. It is not embarrassing to share a room with my sisters. I am going to live at home during college. So are my sisters. We change in front of each other. We are related. They have lots of choices do put on me my    Twin sister has lots of clothes that fit me. They are tying to get   Our parents to buy me my own makeup and girl clothes. I say no because i don't want to be a girl for life.( i think)    My name is a girl name and i am a boy the hospital messed up. So I go by a nick name at school. I like dancing and some other girly stuff. I do have some female features. My voice is soft like a girls. My hair is down to my shoulders. I look like my twin sister. I look like a girl. But i am a boy. I got a full body scan yesterday. I been have some pain. It feels like a girl having her period.    They did some other test today and They found out that I have a    working female reproduction system.    They believe that there me and my sister were going to be triplets but one did not grow and apart of the thing got on me to make me partly a boy. It is hard to explain    When i do get the surgery I have to be a wake. They wont be able to put me to sleep the stuff they use. will make me ill. So they said when i do deiced they will allow my twin to be in    the room with me during it. So she can keep my mind of off the pain.      I already have a girl name. The hospital messed up my name.   My name is amy. But I go by one of my middle names. I have two middle names. I go by one of them which is Jeremiah I have a long name. My last name for example XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX      So if want to have biolgical kids in the long future. I will have to   be a girl. I have a working female reproduction system. I have female hormones.    After my doctors appointment. My mom and my twin sister and I went and ate at wendy's and talked.    Then after we ate. I went and got my ear's priced. Then my mom and twin sister helped me get girl clothes and makeup. Shoes, makeup. A purse.   Some days i fell like i should be a girl. I already have the girl name so i want have to change it.       I am scared of surgery. But i want to have biolgical kids. If I want    to have kids i need surgery and i know it wont take long. I know i    will have to stay in the hospital no more then a week.    I really don't know if i want to be a girl.    I am going to deiced over the next month.    I have both male and female reproduction systems. The female is the only working one.   Any advice to be less scared?      My name for example    Fff mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmm LLLLLLLLLLLLL-LLLLLLLLLLLL         My sister is going to help me over the next month

And like the shower curtain moves for sure without any draft or people near it, I see dark figures sometimes around the house and around the property, and all of this happens to ME.   If it is a ghost, what can I do? Will the prayer of St Gertrude the Great for souls in Purgatory work? What do you think will?         BTW here's the prayer:   Eternal Father, I offer you the most precious Blood of your Divine Son Jesus, in union with the Masses said throughout the world today, for all the Holy Souls in Purgatory, for sinners everywhere, for sinners in the universal Church, those in my own home and within my family. Amen

Since people died instantly from touching it, could it have been electrically charged or be radioactive? Did the hebrews use it to cause the walls of Jericho to crumble?    Also, don't you think the cherubs on it resemble the winged creatures in the tombs of Egyptian pharos? It is possible the Egyptians knew how to create electricity from vinegar and copper and tin pots.

20090226183115AAdMHSu	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why does America need to wake up to what is happening today?	Political Secret Societies      A different type of secret society is the political one whose primary goal is worldly power and whose members seek anonymity for these ambitions. At the simplest level of the political conspiracy are such criminal organizations as the Mafia, whose activities, if revealed, would result in prosecution.    Far more dangerous, are the internationalist societies of the last hundred years (such as the Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs) that are patiently and inexorably striving to build a world government. The membership of such groups is composed of politicians, business people, media leaders, and foundation executives who are able not only to shape public opinion, but to define the very terms of public debate. "The great political issue of our times is not Liberalism versus conservatism, or capitalism versus socialism, but Statism-the belief that government is inherently superior to the citizenry, that progress consists of extending the realm of compulsion, that vesting arbitrary power in government officials will make the people happy--eventually."   Your thoughts on this are welcome.

English is my first language; I have attended school since I was 3 in a half but both my parents are non English speakers.

I tell them my parents are and that is my culture...so then they ask why I do I have an accent.   I mean, my friends who have the same ethnicity as me, and they don't have a Dominican accent which doesn't make sense to me.

20090225121208AAu5499	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually speaking, if people are so sure of their beliefs?	If people are so sure of their beliefs; such as the idea that there is no God whatsoever or that there is only one right faith and religion, then allow me to ask this?       Why get so defensive if someone disagrees rather than just let it be? Why have organizations and websites devoted to spreading what you think and blatantly slander anyone who doesn't believe or think the way you do?       If one is so sure of their beliefs and opinions that they are the only correct ones, or the most intelligent, then there would be no need for debate. People would already "just know". Plus there wouldn't be a need to be so hostile to anyone who thinks or believes differently nor would it need to be "debunked" or "proven false" based on what you believe in your sacred texts.       Instead, why not just accept different beliefs and opinions out there and live and let live? Life's too short to argue and make enemies, not to mention if one is so sure of themselves, then they wouldn't need to defend themselves nor get so high and uptight over someone else's opinion and ways. If you believe or know what you believe to be true, then leave it at that. Find like minded people and leave the rest alone. That's the way human society is anyways.

I asked a tricky little question earlier (I do not claim to know the answer) about diversity of belief and its impact on our society. Got three responses. I'm not complaining - they were ok responses. But I am baffled to see silly, repetitive questions that get asked at least twice a night, and they are flowing with answers from people that I know have answered the same thing a hundred times before.    Now, I have asked questions before that playfully pointed this out. Unfortunately, this caters to the kind of rabble that inhabit this little sphere. After amassing 3,000 + points and seeing many hundreds of questions posed, 98% of them pointless, I have come to the conclusion that serious discussion is practiced so little here that it is actually counterproductive to surf the forum. Regardless of the way things may be in real life, you people present yourselves as mindless, judgemental, arrogant bigots who are constantly trying to validate yourself, searching for ways to "out-shout" somebody that isn't there. If you were actually qualified to be in this forum, it would look a lot different.   Again, I am not saying that you ARE the things mentioned above, I'm saying that's how you look. And it's not everybody, of course, but I can look at any question with 20+ responses, and the serious ones could maybe fill the fingers on one hand. That's not learning. That's navigating through the slime of the earth. It's gotten so bad I've resorted to rudeness to get my account eventually deleted.   Whew! Well, now you know my perspective in asking this.

Think about that.    My hubby fought for his country and the rights of those 2000 little helpless babies, that's what we do, we protect the weak. The mothers that have abortions should be tried and executed. instead we praise those for murder, and attack those who give them the chance of life like the octomom.

I met them both at the beginning of this school year and we have become some what close friends( not as close as my girl friends, who I hang out with more). When I first met them the first one I met, Alonzo came up to me, handed me a piece of paper that had his phone number on it, and said ".........call me babe." I figured he thought I was my sister( me and my sister Enya are twins and we look almost exactly alike) or he was just being a jerk that was making fun of me for being gay( I have told a few friends but most of the time people just know I am), but then I ripped up the paper and he look kinda mad or something. Anyways, over these months that I have been their friend I notice them doing and saying stuff around me that most guys never say or do. Such as, Brian keeps messing with my hair when he sits next to me, they both stare at me, when they see me they come up to me and grape their arms around my neck, they call me the groups doll or they call be bade( really all of my guy friends that are in their group call me that) I asked them to stop it before but they wont they say it suits me, anyways are they hitting on me? If they are then what should I do? I mean I do kinda like them. Help me please.

The only people who I talk to are at workplace, my parents who live in another country and boy friend who stays far off and is always busy. In the past i haven't had a very good experience with friends, unfortunately all of them ended using me for their purpose, none of them were honest with me. This led me to live a loners life. I like going out enjoying, partying but there is no one around whom I can trust or feel comfortable with. This loneliness is making me crazy. I feel like I'm wasting my life. There is work, studies but life has more to offer. I just don't know how to enjoy.      I had friends here whom I cared a lot for, helped in possible ways but when I needed their support for a problem no one was around, I was left alone. Despite that I continued to be with them ignoring their attitude towards me. I recently found out that one of my friends was using me too for her convenience, as a means for entertainment and suddenly she stopped talking to me. I called her, sent her emails asking what went wrong in return I got a cold reply. Her behavior towards is making me feel very bad. This is not how I treat others nor would I like to be treated. I help people, try to make them feel comfortable, go out of way to help others. Wonder why it always happens to me.

I come over while she is at work he is unemployed. He watches straight porn for awhile and then whips it out . I suck it and then he is done.  He never does anything to me we don't kiss etc. He calls me and tells me how good I am and how he misses me.  I drive him around on his errands between jobs and even give him money.

20090226184507AArqreS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How do I stop being nervous around straight guy who already knows I like him & is being cool about it?	He is straight but very gay-friendly, but I still get nervous around him. Why can't I chill out? I think the fact that I get nervous makes him nervous because he's more afraid I'll be convinced he likes me in the wrong way - or thinks other people will think he is gay. I don't have such mistaken beliefs, but he is a cool guy...and I'd rather be his bud than not. I told him about how I feel - but I did not come onto him or disrespect him - and I would not want to do those things. He was totally cool about it. However, we don't click as friends the way we might have if I either had never been out OR if I had never gotten nervous. Why can't I chill out? I swear if he were gay and out, I would have been comfy expressing my admiration for him immediately, he would not have been uncomfy with me, and we would be tight and have no tension between us, just friendship.       Oh yeah, this guy's a good kid - and crush-worthy for guy or girl; I just want the crush over with. (What gets me is random other straight guys who are clearly not comfy with me because I'm openly gay. They are ridiculous for imagining I like them or something. Still, I feel ridiculous for liking this guy.) I think I like him because he's a good kid who I'd want to be just-friends-with whether he were gay or straight. Why is that not easier for me?      Oh yeah... a great link:    http://www.queerty.com/tr-knight-to-stra...

20090226190442AAqmE83	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	MARTIN LUTHER KING QUIZZ?	1. Read Dr. King's speech. Find five words about which you are unsure and look up their meanings. Write their definitions.       2. "Five score years ago," the opening phrase of King's speech, is an allusion to what or whom? Why was this an  appropriate and strong way for King to begin his speech?      3. Find and write down an example of alliteration in King's speech.       4. Find and write down an example of a metaphor in King's speech.      5. Find and write down an example of a simile in King's speech.      6. In the second paragraph, King says that "the life of the ***** is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination."    a. What type of figure of speech is this?    b. These words bring up strong images of slavery. Why would this be an effective method of moving his audience?    c. What inference was King making about the progress of African Americans to enter the mainstream of American life in the one hundred years which followed the end of slavery?    d.    7. Another figure of speech is called an anaphora, or the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of a sentence, verse, or paragraph. Besides the famous "I have a dream" phrase, find two other examples of anaphoras.      8. What are some of the specific acts of injustice against African Americans which King cites in his speech?      9. Near the end of his speech, King names many different states. Why do you think he did this?      10. What is your definition of racism?         Heres the speech if you need it            I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.   Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of ***** slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.   But one hundred years later, the ***** still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the ***** is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the ***** lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the ***** is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.   In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the ***** people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.   It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the *****'s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the ***** needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the ***** is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.   But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.   W

On Thursday, January 29, 2009 The News newspaper reported Edhi is not allowed to visit Gaza. [4]. The newspaper further reported that Abdul Sattar Edhi, who is in Cairo along with Faisal Edhi and his two daughters for the last two weeks to help the affected Palestinians of Gaza, regretted that every coming day was making the sphere of human rights more restrictive across the world. A spokesman for the Edhi Foundation said on Wednesday that Edhi after staying in Cairo and not getting permission to visit Gaza, has reached the conclusion that human rights have been killed and buried deep. He said that he has helped in the provision of relief to people affected by wars, civil wars, earthquakes and drought in 28 countries and was never stopped to do his job. The spokesman said that Edhi has been trying to get permission from Cairo authorities to visit Gaza but in vain. He thanked the Pakistani ambassador to Egypt and the staff of the embassy for their cooperation and said now he was returning home as a depressed person.   ALSO IT WAS NOT HIS FIRST SETBACK   On January 8th, 2008, US immigration officials interrogated Abdul Sattar Edhi at the John F. Kennedy Airport in New York for over eight hours, and seized his passport and other documents.[3]      Edhi told that US immigration officials had questioned him for eight hours at the airport. “During the interrogation, they wanted to know why I traveled to the US so frequently” he said. “I told them about the nature of my work, but they did not understand. They also wanted to know why I was not living in the US in spite of having a green card.” "The only explanation I can think of is my beard and my dress," he said when asked why he had been stopped so often.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Satta...

(I am not talking about people who simply say that they have a disability (physical, cognitive, and/or psychiatric) and are unable to work due to their condition--even if there were jobs available...I am talking about people who come right out and say their disabiity is mild-and go on explaining all the things they can do-never giving any idication that there is some aspect of their disability that makes them unable to work ---except disability discrimination --which is not a qualifier for SS...(they in fact specifically state the only reason they are entitled to SSI is because employers discriminate)         BTW--I am a PWD-...I have been repeatedly victimized by disability discrimination--in the work place and the community---based on how a certain person describes herself--I am somewhat more disabled than her--yet I have been able to find multiple jobs despite many employers engaging in discrimination...i must have been turned down for dozens of jobs in the process....

On top of that, when I asked if she was seeing anyone or if she was in a relationship when we first started chatting she said no. A couple of months later she confessed to me that she was with someone and that she had been lying to him and me. I told her it didn't matter as long as it was over between them and she said it was - two weeks later she move to my state and we've been together every since. When I asked her what the boyfriend did she said nothing but that she was just miserable, unhappy and wanted out. I asked her why she lied to me she said she didn't want to lose me because I was the only bright thing in her life. I felt so bad for her. I've already started to care about her. She said it was the first time she ever cheated on anyone. So, hypothetically speaking, if you were me would you bounce or give it a chance? The fact that she cheated and lied concerns me but I know everyone makes mistakes.      Note: We've been together a year and we've been engaged a year.

The woman that I was dealing with was trying to help me.  I had asked for her help, but she said "hon" and "dear" alot to start.  That put me on edge a little, thinking it sounded sort of "off" from what I am use to hearing from people younger than me.   So, I let it slide a little and proceeded to keep interacting until I had to call her on her sarcasm with me.   On and on it went.  There were tiny underhanded zingers all over the place that I am not used to with someone I don't even know.  Seemed like she had a real problem and I didn't want to put up with it, but at the same time, I didn't want to face off with her...since I didn't really know her.  It was all very uncomfortable, so I started to have fun with it, giving her a bit of a hard time as well.   I feel bad about it, but after trying to apologize about something I said, she told me I was a "good girl."   I laughed out loud and I didn't hear her say "goodbye," but she was definitely GONE after that.   How bad is this?  I am still questioning myself for sticking up for myself.  Do I owe her an apology or should I figure that I am doing myself a favor by dropping it at this point?

Would If I told you my new boyfriend of 2 weeks MAY HAVE lost his cool with me today - physically.    We were having an argument and he threw me on the bed and held his arm over my front neck and screamed "look at me!!!!!!!!". He looked like such a monster or mad man (in his eyes) when he was telling me to look at him. He simply didn't look like the man I Met. Again Hypothetical situation. Minutes later he had twisted my arm - it was so extremely painful - I screamed and "said I"m sorry - I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!"   You would think that would make him stop. But he just twisted it more and asked me to say stuff I couldn't understand. So I kept saying "i'm sorry, I'm sorry". MOre like screaming it cause I was in severe pain. I thought my shoulder would break. He twisted 3 times before he let up.      I cried afterwards - I put my face in my pillow and cried. He said next to me said "he loved me so much" and he said " you have no idea how much I like you. You really have no idea how much I like you". He was nicely touching my hair and back. I asked him not to touch me and please leave me alone.       I composed myself after 5 minutes and left his condo without saying a word.      Can I please get your thoughts????   I have never never ever been in this predictment. I have not told a living soul. I'm too ashamed & scared.       CAn you please write me back.       Jen

Now, I'm sober, but apparently my gay fingers are sloshed. *hic* Anyone else ever had this problem of thinking perfectly lucid yet having your fingers slur and misspell your words like some nincompoop who learned to spell in some sort of ridiculous phonics missionary camp?       I don't care if somebody can't spell well. But I do care if my own homosexual fingers can't spell whell. I think my gay fingers have drunken, disoriented cuticles. Is that possible? I would never have thunk it possible. o-O      Thaynk you      Omega

20090226173003AATP3jk	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is it lewd or not for parents to be touchy with their children?	I'm bothered by the family whose house is adjacent to mine. The father is in his late 30's and the daughter is 12 years old. I've witnessed parents who are too sweet with their children to the point of being touchy. But this one bothers me so much.(Is it just me who find it lewd?)      1. The daughter is physically well-developed at her age but is still childish and playful. One day, the daughter was wearing a low-cut blouse and the father reminded her "Your boobs are showing."   2. On another occasion, the father was caressing the thighs of his daughter "to check if it's smooth."   3. I heard the father telling his daughter that it's okay to go braless at home. The mother was there when he said it.   4. The father always asks his daughter to sit on his lap.

Step 1: Imagine you are in a box.    Step 2: Imagine there are no windows and or doors on the box.    Step 3: Imagine the walls of the box are solid steel and are each over 20 meters thick.    Step 4: Imagine all the walls are welded, hot-glued and super-glued shut.    Step 5: Do not imagine yourself having any super-powers.    Question: How do you get out of the box?                                                    Answer to Question: Stop Imagining!!!!!!!                  2. A blonde is terribly overweight, so her doctor puts her on a diet. "I want you to eat regularly for 2 days, then skip a day, and repeat this procedure for 2 weeks. The next time I see you, you'll have lost at least 5 pounds."      When the blonde returned, she shocked the doctor by losing nearly 20 pounds. "Why, that's amazing!" the doctor said, "Did you follow my instructions?"       The blonde nodded, "I'll tell you though, I thought I was going to drop dead that 3rd day."      "From hunger, you mean?", asked the doctor."       "No, from all that skipping."               3. The little old couple walked slowly into McDonalds that cold winter evening.      They looked out of place amid the young families and young couples eating there that night. Some of the customers looked admiringly at them.      You could tell what the admirers were thinking. "Look, there is a couple who has been through a lot together, probably for 60 years or more!"      The little old man walked right up to the cash register, placed his order with no hesitation and then paid for their meal. The couple took a table near the back wall and started taking food off of the tray. There was one hamburger, one order of french fries and one drink.      The little old man unwrapped the plain hamburger and carefully cut it in half. He placed one half in front of his wife. Then he carefully counted out the french fries, divided them in two piles and neatly placed one pile in front of his wife. He took a sip of the drink, his wife took a sip and then set the cup down between them.      As the man began to eat his few bites of hamburger the crowd began to get restless. Again you could tell what they were thinking. "That poor old couple. All they can afford is one meal for the two of them."      As the man began to eat his french fries, one young man stood and came over to the old couples table. He politely offered to buy another meal for the old couple to eat. The old man replied that they were just fine. Theywere used to sharing everything.      Then the crowd noticed that the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. She just sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink. Again the young man came over and begged them to let him buy them something to eat. This time the lady explained that no, they were used to sharing everything together.      As the little old man finished eating and was wiping his face neatly with a napkin, the young man could stand it no longer. Again, he came over to their table and offered to buy some food. After being politely refused again he finally asked a question of the little old lady.      "Ma'am, why aren't you eating. You said that you share everything. " What is it that you are waiting for?"      She answered, "The Teeth"

This doesn't make sense to me.      -what difference does it make if the person you like dates a person of a different race as opposed to you? does them dating the same race really make a difference? I mean you still couldn't score with them.   -and if you have no interest at all in the person dating outside of your race then why would it matter to you?       I mean shouldn't people just...mind their own business? I think people who look down on others for dating outside of their race are sore and bitter because they couldnt score with that person.

20090226183327AAGUO5Y	Society & Culture;Languages	Japanese names: "familiarness" between friends?	okay, i am writing a novel (dont ask) that takes place in a fictional island in the Pacific ocean, between the US and Japan. the island is to have a culture mix of both american and japanese.      okay, so in the story, there are two teens (a girl and a boy) that become closer as the story goes on. okay, so they both know each other for three years, spending everyday with each other (explained in the story). the story opens with them calling each other by first names.      The question is this: the girl, in the middle of the story, creates a pet-name using the first syllable of the boy's first name, and adding -kun to the end. would this be considered a step up or down in "familiarness"? or does it depend of the prospective (since it is from the boy's).      i am sorry if this is a seemingly stupid question to those who know the answer. i am not that familiar with the japanese customs nor language. i thank you in advance for your answers.

20090226191547AAebUvg	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is anyone else mad with the black to the future 90s section?	Okay, for those of you who don't know, VH1 is doing a show called black to the future, doing each decade from 1970s to 2000s, talking about significant black things from each decade. They did a decade each day, and i liked the 70s and 80s episodes, but when they got to the 90s section (which was today) i was pissed off. There are so many great things involving blacks from the 90s, and they showed the stupidest sh*t. They talked about billy blanks, hootie and the blowfish, arsenio hall show, rodney king, million man march, and other sh*t. The only hip hop they mentioned was kid n play, snoop dogg and dr. dre. The only black movie they talked about was Boyz n the hood. I can't believe how much good sh*t they left out! They didn't even talk about 2pac and biggie, and briefly showed TLC. I'm tired of these VH1 shows being biased. Here is some good things they missed:      Juice   Poetic justice   Above the rim   Friday   Set it off   Player's club   Dead presidents   New jack city   SWV   TLC   Biggie    2pac   Comic view   Eddie murphy   The nutty professor   There are no children here   Menace 2 society   The inkwell   Larenz tate   Jada pinkett   BAPS   Woo   Jason's lyric   Bill belamy's how to be a player         The list could go on and on. Just so much stuff they didn't talk about.

20090226191351AAFsN4D	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Blacks: What do you think of being given reparations?	Today, I was on the school bus and me and some other students where talking about the subject of reparations. I personally think the idea of being given reparations is ridiculous considering the generation it would be given to. I think that even if Blacks were given reparations for what happened in the past, it would be too late and it wouldn't even matter, because those who really deserve it are dead and gone.       In all reality, do you think that many of us would really know what to do with it? Do you think IF that were to ever happen, that all of us as a whole would invest in it wisely?      I am asking this question because I was interested in what the African-American point of view with this would be.

20090226190200AA0hNrX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think it would've been better if humans were living like in the beginning of human life?	Like for example the way we live now with violence, people killing people,rapes,poverty, work till we die, basically work to put food on the table then the same thing the next day. In this society they tell us the only way to really live freely is to gain education, which is not bad but then again that is what we have been told. We as humans don't need it to survive but we do if we live in a world with a government, like money in exchange for something else, mostly for pleasure which most of the time then leads to spending money on worthless things, then the richer man becomes more rich. It's a big pattern. You get the picture. I can go at this all day but long story short, That's how this world became the crazy world we live in today. Personally I think the way we live makes us small minded and not even appreciating nature,life etc. Basically we are destroying ourselves slowly. We're materialistic we idolize material but if you think about it, it's meaningless. Like if the economy would collapse what would us humans do, did you ever think about that? we would not know how to survive naturally. Even tho we are surrounded by food, we wouldn't know how to find it, kill it. How human society as developed to kill then sell in markets so then people can eat. The only people that wouldn't be effected by this would be the people who live in the jungle, in natural rain forest places like that. And to them hunting is like going to work. Think about it, the way we lived thousands of years ago, we were better off, minus all the negatives I listed like there wouldn't be no poverty or I'm broke, or homeless, we as civilized people depend on the government, no matter how independent we are we still are depending on the higher guy, above us just a notch. Some people might say yea but we as people have advanced in technology and medicine more smarter etc. And that's true but has it done more harm then good? or more good then harm? I just wanted to know what do you people think? your opinions? if you disagree with me or agree. Please mature people.

"These guys want to be the creme" continued the officer. Because when something in the world happens they are the first ones there.  Here is a different example of a good answer (fiction.)  I was watching a movie last week that pictured a business man/decision maker/politician in a futuristic office.  His job was to listen to short lectures by cutting edge intellects one after another. His lifestyle was a revolving cast of new ideas and events. That said, what role do you believe is the cream that rises to the top present day?
