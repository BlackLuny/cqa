hTGu2ujeaa	Um...I'm not a christian...I believe in global warming but I mean the earths natural fluctuations compared to the man-made disaster the media is bigging it up to be. <br>  <br>  I don't know which country you're talking about, i live in britain...30 years ago there was so much more snow, people have been saying the February snow here is global warming...utter bollocks, it's a changing climate, 300 years ago we were in a mini ice-age we're still leaving that. I<br>  <br>  I know people are saying we've exceeded the natural fluctuation amount but we need numbers outside the regular mean in order to make an average. <br>  <br>  BUT, you've got yourself on to a good career here...pretend to do research for a year and then tell everyone it's global warming and BINGO you're set for life.|`|PvZ8bmuIaa	im a catholic-christian and i KNOW global warming isnt man made or a proble today:<br>  <br>  global warming isn't a problem in our world today because it's not true. the average amount of carbon dioxide in the air now is .04%. There is so much evidence against global warming that they are even trying to change the name to climate changing because they know they are wrong. In russia they are even starting to say there is global cooling going on now, so its all just something that al gore made up because he wanted attention. MAN-BEAR-PIG!|`|AA11949268	Snow in  Winter what a concept  . One storm proves nothing .<br>  It snowed in April when I was a Jr  in High School  6 inches<br>  in the 70s . No snow day either. It was gone by friday <br>  when it hit the 70s as per normal.<br>  <br>  You are panicking  over a snowstorm , relax spring will be here <br>  and the weather will be warmer.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	Lets start with why it was probably deleted .... You referred to Christians as EVIL. And this one will probably be deleted as you have referred to Y!A admin as stupid.<br>  <br>  Now to answer the question, though it doesn't really deserve that title.<br>  <br>  Belief, or disbelief, in AGW has nothing to do with someones religion (though it's a shame the same can't be said about it being linked to peoples political alignment).<br>  <br>  Anyone claiming it is to do with religion is purely showing their own religious bigotism.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It's snowing in South West England at the minute, is that down to Christians as well? Are they sending it to punish the workers at the Meteorological Office for the bad winter(especially Atheists like myself)?.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: Will these same "Evil" (to use the question askers word from the 1st copy of this, that was rightly deleted) Christians also send me my own personal snow storm for throwing snowballs at rabbits?|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	First of all, the northeast getting pounded by snow isn't proof of global warming.  The northeast obviously got pounded by late winter storms when glaciers were a mile high over New York City.  It is difficult to see your point.  You are either being sarcastic that christians are too stupid to understand global warming or that those that believe in global warming blame Christians for not believing or you are trying to pigeonhole skeptics as people that are only skeptical because of religious reasons.  Any of those are ridiculous assumptions.
hhr3A1bSaa	**** it, its whenever the hell you want it to be. i would say 4 20 in the afternoon, because you dont want to wake up at 4 20 in the morning to smoke, you want to be able to get a good nights sleep, so you get a good high after sleeping all night, and waiting all day, and actually doing stuff that you have to do, so when 4 20 in the afternoon comes, its nice.|`|2h57vimBaa	first off its a day.. April 20th, but people who just do it at the time of 4:20 in the morning or evening. Whenever the white man feel like gettin high he get high|`|9LXXs93haa	after 12 noon,it's 13:00,and after 12 midnight it's the start of another set of 24 hrs so it's 1:00 am.|`|PNz9WVhWaa	It's either.

5f4KSdI0aa	Oil is the number one !...<br>  <br>  Oil pollution is everywhere and everytime with us.<br>  It's much better to make hydrogen from coal (in isolated places) in order to have clean hydrogen where we are...
RD05jXYwaa	they do eat mosquitoes but i am not sure 'houses'  will work for bats but martins will go for houses and they eat mosquitoes to. tmm|`|bKwQyCEHaa	i had one but the bats did not go in there they went up in the roof of my gazebo|`|N6Xzt9q7aa	I have had one up for years no bats :(

nAK8bm91aa	Ethyl is higher as in flashpoint, gasoline has a lower flashpoint but just as explosive.|`|npBCankMaa	ethanol will vapourize more readily than gasoline.  If they reach an ignition source, ka-boom.|`|b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	It acts in much the same way, although it has considerably less BTU. Alcohol's Vapor Pressure is higher than gasoline's.
