B7qPxYqHaa	A: Tell a teacher or trusted adult.<br>  B: Ignore them.<br>  C: Move schools<br>  D: Look in a book for smart-alek things to say and use them to back you up. Such as if a weird guy you hate tells you he likes you, say (with a sweet/sarcastic voice) 'Awww! I like you too! Deep-Fried with a side of cocktail sauce' then walk away. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Had to include this: On my way to first hour, four girls were leaning against the hall-walls. They looked at me and said: 'Hi Paula!" My name is not Paula! I asked some girls in 1st pd, and they said the girls said Hi to them too! (P.S. Most 7-8th graders are creepy goth kids who die their hair black. your not alone.)|`|Ko4y7eVUaa	Give him a good kick to the family jewels, then run away screaming "RAPE!"|`|5e0RZUfKaa	Do not slap him. By doing so, you verify that he really exists, therefore he will continue.  Then he knows that you notice him. Best advice? Ignore him, and block the baaad, creepy things he says from dwelling in your mind. He will not stick round long if he does not get any type of 'rise' out of you.  It takes focus to do the nothing treatment. Treat him as though he does not exist: don't look at him, or respond to him. Just keep your mind on something more productive. Develop a conversation strategy between you and your friends, that will kick in whenever he is around...Something as mundane as things all you can say about the sky and the weather.|`|WzusAmjYaa	You have to tell an adult....he probably has some issues.....and the last thing you want is him following you until he knows where you live.....and after a few years, he may become dangerous.....|`|44vgFcKcaa	No, do not touch him.

Mine for example has a cord that allows me to hook it up to my comp and transfer files from my phone to my comp or vise versa.|`|fSzEGjUlaa	i would use a memory card--go and by one--normally on a computer, you can stick it in like any old memory stick for your camera.<br>  <br>  the actual card is tiny--it comes w/ a larger adapter, in which newer models of computers have a slot for. stick it in, then transfer them on, like a flash drive by copy+paste. <br>  <br>  i would go to your phone retail center--like verizon, t-moble, ect. where they cell phones from the phone company. <br>  <br>  but i also think that you'll need a USB cable/ software so that your phone reconizes the photo files--i have a chip, it doesn't do anything--my phone doesn't reconize the files, and i can't access them. it's stored on there, just taking up space.|`|1909cVAaaa	there are 3 ways  i will explain to you:<br>  1. through blue tooth. if your computer equipped with bluetooth it is very easy to tranfers you picture to your celfon.make sure that the bluetooth of your celfon is on so that it can be detect by your pc if you search for a bluetooth device.<br>  <br>  2. If you still have the installation cd of your celfon and your usb cable(usually it is included when you buy celfon).connect your celfon to you computer using that cable and install the software in the cd.then you will have connection between your pc and celfon,then tranfer of file is possible.<br>  <br>  3.another one is using your celfon's memory card.your computer must have card reader(it is available in stores:D). just insert memory card of your celfon to your card reader, and you can add files like normal memory stick to that memory card.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	my best thought would be to go to your email. get your email set up to send a pic.1 pic. then type your phones number in and an @_______________ <----- insert your phone companies name then a dot com. my best idea. try it. see what you get.

zDQIPFH2aa	You are probably asking them in a chatty form.  For example, if you start "Do you know where...?", that is chatting on YA.  Post the violation e-mails you get in questions here and experienced users can explain.<br>  <br>  There are actually several reason questions are removed:<br>  <br>  1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens. If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem. There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.<br>  <br>  2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.

There is tutorials and workshops but, seller central will show you the problems that could come along with ebay sales.  Do not list anything too low, list for what you think it is worth.  There are countless examples of expensive items selling for dirt cheap.  When you log on check out advanced search and put a check on completed listings, which will show how much a particular item sold for.  Since you are new I would not offer free shipping.  Ebay touts that everyone should use free shipping but I think you should not use that until you see how everything works.  Lastly, only list a couple items at first to see how ebay works, then list other items after you get your feet wet.|`|30BoVgcgaa	Hi i have sold a few things on ebay myself and found it quite easy to do the 1st time i used it so u really shouldnt have any probs, i tell ya if i can work it out 1st go any 1 can LOL, you shouldnt have any probs at all its pretty straight forward.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	theres no real trick to it. it is all about about assessing your items conditions.if you have owned the item for lets say 5 years, take ten bucks off for your use of this item. if there are any imperfections take 5 -10 bucks off for those. its all about playing it correctly for what they are worth.|`|QhmKvf5Iaa	you can also try <a href="http://www.economybid.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.economybid.com</a> these guys are starting and they are giving free inserts until june this means that you dont have to pay to put your stuff online.|`|896be109453cf76b326ad27023084d3caa	It's really easy ...

I used an Ebay seller, once, but I had to hand over 25% of my 'winnings', which hurt and frankly I'd never do it again.  Okay he did all the work, including postage and packing, but still it made a huge hole in what I received at the end.<br>  <br>  I'm sure it's easy because by my experience with some sellers on there, you only need half a brain cell to become a seller   lol.
KG0B5dNFaa	No it is not just you. Some people just answer really quick to get points for their answers even though they didn't really contribute anything. It sucks but there's not really much you can do about it.

1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	I have Windows Vista as my platform on my computer. Actually, I do no longer use Internet Explorer. I often use Google Chrome and less often Mozilla Firefox.<br>  <br>  I'm not interested in setting Yahoo! Mail as my default email program, simply because whenever I want to send an email, I sign in my Yahoo! Mail and use it. I do not send emails so often. <br>  <br>  Yet, about a week ago, I read a question here on Yahoo! Answers where a user was wondering; she claimed that she had downloaded both Yahoo! Toolbar and Yahoo! Messenger in order to be able to make Yahoo! Mail her default email application. <br>  <br>  However, she did not find Yahoo! Mail showing up among the options in the Internet Options for the default email program even after restarting her computer. <br>  <br>  Trying to answer the question, I investigated this issue and did a simple research on the web. <br>  <br>  Finally, I realized that most likely the problem is that her platform must have been Windows Vista as I discovered that YAHOO! AS DEFAULT EMAIL DOES NOT WORK UNDER WINDOWS VISTA.<br>  <br>  (Sources)▼<br>  <a href="http://email.about.com/od/yahoomailtips/qt/et_default_mail.htm" rel="nofollow">http://email.about.com/od/yahoomailtips/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/original/settings/settings-10.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/or...</a><br>  <br>  <Edit> Just after I had submitted this answer, I tried again to search for a solution for that "problem".

HTZ8C3XXaa	The answer below if for use of PAINT:<br>  <br>  Remember this before you start:<br>  Don't use your mouse scroll because it can't be undone. Remember that you can only undo the last 3 actions.  In order for this method to work, the paste settings should be set to transparent. Failure to do this will result in the background from the original picture being pasted over the new background. The paste settings toolbar appears below the main toolbar at the left hand side of your image when either selection tool is used. <br>  Green screening in this method is not as easy as it is with software (such as Adobe Photoshop) but it does a reasonably good job depending on how thorough you are. <br>  Quite often you're likely to make a mistake, or redo a line. keep your fingers on the Ctrl+Z keys, as this key combination allows you to undo the last action. <br>  The larger your image is, the longer it will take to go around it. If you want to make it smaller, press Ctrl+A and drag the bottom-right adjustment notch upwards - try to keep the proportion, as your image will be contorted if you don't. <br>  If you have a rounded edge you can use the curved line tool - click on the curvy line option from the toolbar and draw the straight line from the beginning of the curve to the end. then drag the line outwards with your mouse to suit the curve. <br>  <br>  Start here:<br>  Open the image that you want to green screen in MS Paint (it supports among others BMP, JPEG and GIF formats). <br>  If the image is larger than your screen, move to the bottom-left corner. Then zoom in to 800% (click the magnifying glass on the tool bar and then click 8). <br>  On the color palette, select the lime green color - lime green is used because it seldom appears anywhere on the image to be cut out. <br>  Select the line tool and start outlining the object to be cut out. <br>  If the object is against a light background, use the pencil tool to touch out any missed pixels. You should have a thick green line around your object. <br>  Right-click on the lime green color (palette) and use the select tool to select and delete rectangular areas of the background, making sure you don't go into the object. Don't worry too much about accuracy, there's a way to get rid of redundant triangles around the shape in the next step. <br>  Click the eraser tool and select the smallest square on the menu that appears. Erase all of the spots around the shape that you missed whilst deleting the rectangles. <br>  You now have a green screened object. If you want to make a solid color tool, zoom out to 100% (1 on the zoom menu) and click on the fill (paint bucket) tool. Then select your chosen background color from the palette, and click anywhere on the green area - it will change the background. <br>  To move the object to another background, click on the white color from the palette and use the Fill tool (explained in step 8) to turn the whole green screened background white. <br>  Press Ctrl+A - on the toolbar menu that appears click the second (bottom) icon. <br>  Ensure that the new background for your object is open in another window of paint. Now, copy the work (Ctl+C). <br>  In the second paint window, paste your work (Ctrl+V). Drag it into position and click anywhere on the toolbar - done! Save your work|`|rAa8bfhwaa	paint|`|dXDroPtfaa	Just go to paint, and use the eraser to erase your background!simplee.(:|`|WpaQKpckaa	the highlight feature on picasa|`|KkjOXRRWaa	Paint.|`|eR7BjZvIaa	paint, be patient|`|ejelObdJaa	i cnt really explan it BUT u can go to limewire & download photoshop :].. dats how i got mine hehe =]|`|dfimWhmNaa	seperate the two things (the object and the background) using a cutting tool and sve them sepratley, make the one with the backgroiund black and white and then open them both on paint move the object back into the picture and save . voila!|`|4cEmhOK0aa	You can use paint.

It will take you to the link.<br>  <br>  OR...<br>   <br>  Just type in avatars.yahoo.com in the search bar at the top of your webpage.

The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM.

You can always find your Y! toolbar bookmarks at site bookmarks.yahoo.com.  If you are talking about the Y! home page yahoo.com, then it no longer lists Y! bookmarks; however, you can customize your own Y! page at My Yahoo!

2HETgiwgaa	'tlg' appears to stand for Trilegiant Corporation - and you may have inadvertently been signed up for a "membership" when you purchased something else - entertainment (tickets) or travel, for example; or even by cashing a check they may have sent you in the mail (there would be something in the fine print about your cashing the check being acceptance of membership in "Buyers Advantage" - the membership being what the charges are for).  Great Fun is one of their direct marketing businesses.<br>  <br>  It looks like you're not the only one with this complaint - call the company and, if they won't reverse it, talk to your bank/credit card company.  If the company says you signed up for a membership, tell them you never knowingly did so and you want to cancel it (you can't enter into an enforceable contract without your knowledge).  Be vigilant from now on as well, in case the charge appears again (some of their billing is monthly). The posts at the second link below include phone numbers you can call - or check out contact details on Trilegiant's own website.  <br>  <br>  If you are interested - there was a lawsuit filed against them in 2006, the case appears to be ongoing, and the law firm involved still want to hear from anyone who has a complaint like yours about Trilegiant. <br>  <br>  BTW - I notice you posted a password in one of your other questions - NEVER do that.

Even if you dont have warranty...they are aware of the problem, sometimes you have to send it to them for repair...but sometimes they can have a tech walk you through it to fix it. It depends...just call them! 1-800-MY-XBOX or visit their website.<br>  IF they know of the 'ring of death' problems and have been fixing it for others, even without a warranty they are aware this isnt YOUR FAULT and is a defect from the manufacturer! They should want to keep their customers and ask to speak with a manager if you dont get resolution from the representative you speak with. Good Luck|`|rhTCejrtaa	ITS DEAD!! no seriously its broken you need to turn it in. hopefully you have a warranty.|`|7Zdabhdkaa	hmmmm if its the red rings of death you pretty much wont have a xbox for a couple of weeks you will have to send it ti microsoft (if you still have a warranty) if not i think they will some how repair it for you
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Your Avatar.<br>  <br>  Your avatar can be a cartoon figure or a photo. The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM. Shortcut: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit</a><br>  <br>  NOTE: Many people are having problems with the Yahoo 360 avatar showing up. My only recommendation is to wait or try deleting and recreating it.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

AA11307940	Yahoo Briefcase closing will not affect anything except the briefcase. Make sure if you have anything in there that you move it out or it will be deleted.|`|0bckNgILaa	Not sure what all stars mean but what I can tell you is that Yahoo briefcase is used when you upload files/documents from your computer. If you've never used Yahoo briefcase before, then I wouldn't worry about it. Hope I helped a little bit.
V90Ao2jfaa	you should post a link to a picture. You have to learn what pose suits you best. You should practice in a mirror or even better: a camera phone. <br>  <br>  All this means is that your face is unsymmetrical is some way. <br>  <br>  Example: In my case I have a big nose and a round face. So I've learned that I look better taking a 3/4 shot from below. This helps emphasize my jaw line making my face look thinner and it also makes my nose look a little smaller when shot from below.<br>  <br>  Answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Atkgf5bcf0hSK5EK6ebJzw7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307141722AAWbMVx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4Xyk2Ky4aa	Firstly sit yourself in front of a mirror try to relax don't be nervous try different hair-styles then try different types of clothing just to see what you feel comfortable in. ok  I hope that this helps.|`|aOioLue3aa	if you have msn, add me. TempahB65@hotmail.co.uk, and i will edit a picture for youuu. :)|`|2b7LblMHaa	im not photogenic either.. just dont try too hard|`|A6tkE0fAaa	photo shop it??|`|OXohgDoJaa	The camera doesn't lie.

AA10293429	Sounds like you may have been hacked, or have a Virus.<br>  When sending mail, use the Bcc field to protect your friend's addresses.  Just add one in the To field.  Before sending or Forwarding mail, delete the previous senders to protect them also.  <br>  Set up your Spam Protection.<br>  1. Click on the "Options", Mail Options link in the upper right of your yahoo mail page.<br>  2. Click on "Spam Protection", fill out the form and click the "Save Changes" button.<br>  Once you have this set up, each time you see spam or mail that you want to block, check the box next to it, go to the top of the email list and click the "Spam" button.<br>  <br>  Note: Every message you report trains your Spam Guard filters to work better for you. The messages you select in this way will be deleted and reported as spam.<br>  The senders of the messages will be added to your "Blocked Addresses" list.<br>  <br>  PREVENT ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT:<br>  1. Change your password.<br>  2. Clean your cache, delete history of visited websites and "Sign Out" of your account completely before leaving the computer. Click the "Sign Out" button.<br>  If you leave it open, anyone can open and read your email. They can also go to the history function, or just hit the back button and get into your account. <br>  Don't forget your ID and new password though. You will need it the next time you sign into your Yahoo account.|`|44vgFcKcaa	What makes you think they stole your address book? If they are sending mail to your contacts, you may have picked up a virus.<br>  Immediately have your computer checked for a bug or 'bugs.'<br>  Once it is clean of pests, install a firewall and an anti-virus program if you do not have one yet.<br>  I strongly recommend a program for malware and adware also.<br>  Changing your password may not be enough to secure your E-mail account again, and you may have to open a new one with a different ID name and password.
ed9d043b6f264160aa0190d0e584de12aa	If you turn on your Yahoo Messenger,then at the top<br>  click on  Contact details and where is says "nickname"<br>  change it to what you would like to be seen as then click<br>  "save and close"<br>  good luck

2F5XkiHLaa	One of the things you are supposed to do prior to a service pack, SP3 in this case, is to clean your machine with your anti-spyware programs. This could be the reason for these problems, it's hard to tell from here.<br>  <br>  Since you got back files & programs that had 'disappeared' I would now run scans with your anti-virus & anti-spyware programs (update first, of course) and update Windows & all your other programs. Then turn off System Restore to remove any infected restore points & turn it back on to create a new, clean restore point. After a restart, you should be good to go<br>  .|`|OiH3n5hIaa	I recovered some lost files once when I used my Kaspersky Anti-virus system restore date.  So I agree with taz c.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Try manually resetting the System Restore Date. If that doesn't work,  ask an expert, cos I wouldn't want to be responsible for knackering your machine.
puY8Zxuwaa	Be EXTREMELY careful printing any coupons. A lot of coupon sites are "phishing" sites that just want to get a virus on to your computer. They ask you to download a printer driver and then POOF your computer turns into a watermelon... you know what I mean :)<br>  <br>  If you're looking for coupons, I'd go with <a href="http://brandnamecoupon.com" rel="nofollow">http://brandnamecoupon.com</a> IMO it's the only safe site to get coupons from. You pay a few pennies or dollars for each one but it's more than worth it and they never ask for any personal info or to download anything. I like it.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	coupons.com<br>  <br>  No kidding|`|AA11019972	mylocaltacobell<br>  sign up for coupon<br>  free burrito supreme with a purchase of a burrito supreme and 32 oz.drink<br>  free mexican pizza with a purchase of a mexican pizza  and 32 oz drink<br>  good until 12/31/09<br>  save it so you can print it over and over again.i use this alot<br>  <br>  <br>  country

kJTzXWoPaa	I don't understand what you mean by "private" page on My Yahoo. No one sees that page but you anyway.<br>  <br>  In other cases though, if the plan is to be sociable and meet new and interesting people, I would suggest you go unprivate, as you say. :-)|`|Zyuebg8eaa	non private...rightly
