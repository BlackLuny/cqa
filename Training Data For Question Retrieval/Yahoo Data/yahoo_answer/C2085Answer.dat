jKfV6DoOaa	Yes,you can be signed into your Yahoo!Messenger on one computer and still sign into your Yahoo!Messenger with the same ID on another computer. It signs you then out of the computer that you were already logged into and shows you on that computer this message, " You have been signed out because you signed in on a different computer or device." <br>  <br>  The only way this is possible is, if someone knows your Yahoo! ID and password. Are you sure that you have never ever signed into any other computer with your ID and password except the one at your home? Sometimes people sign into a computer in an Internet shop or elsewhere and they don't sign out properly or they forget to uncheck the "Remember my ID & password" box or "Sign in automatically" box. <br>  I have seen that happening a lot with friends when they used a computer in an Internet cafe. <br>  It can be that you signed into another computer just once and you forgot to uncheck that boxes and so when that other computer starts up you get automatically signed in there. But it is also possible that someone has sent you a fishing web page and got you to the point where you thought it was a legitimate web page from Yahoo and therefore you put your Yahoo! ID and password on it and once you clicked the sign in key it sent your information to a fishing page and not to Yahoo. Did you write down your Yahoo! ID and password somewhere and someone else could have had access to it and seen it? These are just a few possibilities... <br>  What I would recommend you to do is to sign into your Yahoo!Messenger account and change your password immediately.<br>  Make sure that you use a good and safe password. Use words and names that are not easy to know and not in dictionaries and that only might mean something to you. Use lover and upper case letters and also numbers and sings etc... A strong password is always a good start. This would be an example of a strong password !1M@xFresh1!  <br>  Be creative... once you have changed your password I would recommend you to report this incident to the Yahoo!Messenger team. <br>  They will further assist you in that matter. You can click on Yahoo! Help on the top of your Yahoo!Messenger even if you are not able to sing into your account. Just click on "Help" then on "Messenger Help" then a web page opens up and there you click on the yellow link " Chat with us live now"...You can tell them your situation and they will be able to help you out with all this. <br>  You can prevent yourself from this fishing web pages that can fish for your Yahoo! ID and password. Here is how...Yahoo has since quite a while this feature called "Yahoo!Sign in Seal" that I would recommend you to use from now on. Copy and past this link here or just click on it <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/privacy/;_ylt=Avr8q18Y9QsVryFrLp_76g.NkiN4">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/pr...</a> <br>  and then click on "Creating Your Sign-In Seal". This protects you from this fishing sides in the future when you sign into your Yahoo!Mail. <br>  You will find all the necessary information about that seal right on that link. <br>  Make also sure that you have the latest Yahoo!Messenger version. When you click on "Help" on your Yahoo!Messenger and then on "About Yahoo!Messenger.,.." it will open up a window that shows you which version you have. The latest version is right now Yahoo!Messenger 9.0.0.2128... If you sign into your Yahoo!Messenger and click on "Help" and then in the menu click on "check for updates" and then it will open up a download web page for the latest version of Yahoo!Messenger or it will tell you this, if you have the latest version " Congratulations! You are currently running the latest Yahoo!Messenger version 9.0.02128"..if not you just update it. Hope I could help you out. Good luck and have a great day. :o)))

Answers profile and wait.<br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just go through the process and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes your 360 image appear. If you would prefer not to wait, then continue using a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com)" rel="nofollow">http://avatars.yahoo.com)</a> and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  Otherwise after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.

cIZS6Wr2aa	It sounds like ********* here in the usa.  It started out ok.  You had to play literally days of endless lotto drawings to win a 25.00 gift card.  Then they made it even harder.  And they lied and said that the part of the site that helped you win the gift cards wasn't working but I knew that they were actually just taking it away.  And sure enough 6 months later!  Yep, it still wasn't working which meant your chances of winning were very slim any more.  It's probably a scam like that.|`|evaZJkekaa	Well, there are offers and surveys on the site that you complete. Use RoboForm to quicken the process.

I know how frustrating it can be when things don't work and you have no solution on hand right away.

tdQTZPI7aa	Better thumbs down then being reported for a question and or answer that violates the community guidelines.  Opinions are violations.  Questions must seek knowledge or advice|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Take a simple question. What is your favorite color? (note this question is a violation, but for illustrative purposes here). If you answer pink and someone answers blue, instead of other people answering blue or pink, they just TU/TD the answers. If they don't like your pink and are neutral on blue, they may TD you and do nothing for the other answer. It is nothing personal, it is just away of agreeing or not.<br>  <br>  However, thumbs down can be gotten for many reasons, only one of which is the correct usage. Some of the ways:<br>  <br>  1. the answer is incorrect or you disagree with an opinion (the only real reasons)<br>  2. you sound over 18 (believe it or not)<br>  3. you support the rules on YA<br>  4. you understand the rules of YA<br>  5. you take the site seriously<br>  6. you answered the question (some answerers will TD all other answers)<br>  7. it was fun (random playing)<br>  8. you are in the military, a policeman, or some authority figure<br>  9. etc - <br>  <br>  very few TDs are legit so don't sweat it unless you get one say on a science or math question, then review your answer for a mistake.|`|34090baae43bdcb8c4c4335f475f6aa1aa	Frankly, I've never seen the need for the option for thumbs up or down.<br>  Just ignore it, some will  use that feature just to be silly.|`|td6WXhv4aa	Their Trolls they thumb down your answer weather it's good or not they don't care.|`|7xq7hUB7aa	because we suck! watch me get the most thumbs down..........|`|igI5yX0vaa	Because they don't like your opinion and can give thumbs down anonymously.<br>  <br>  I think it's cowardly.

W0ZsuxRTaa	i think that a lot of times, the advise questions are a lot to read and most people just want things to be speedy. <br>  i think another big reason is because giving advise to someone you know only through the internet can be uncomfortable.  A lot of people feel like relationship advice and stuff like that should be talked about with family and peers, not online strangers.|`|TQVMAZUbaa	Serious answers to serious questions require thought, education, experience, and consideration.<br>  <br>  It's much easier to provide a flippant answer to a stupid question.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	It is harder to think than to not think. Posting "YEA!" to a silly question is often overlooked as a violation; posting that to a serious question will almost always get it reported.<br>  <br>  Why should somebody think, research and work for their measly '2 points' if they don't have to?

1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	Just because the question or answer you reported wasn't removed right away does not mean you're not trusted. Trust scores are always in flux, so you're not either “trusted” or “not trusted”--they are not mutually exclusive. Whether or not a question or answer is removed right away when you report it depends on many metrics, including your trust score, the trust score of others who may have reported it, and the trust score of the poster. It also depends on whether the report is being sent to the customer care team or the community moderation system.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	It is also a known fact that reliability depends of 'reporting correctly'. If you, in fact, don't report very often, the probability is that you have not been building up your trust level, and therefore may not have a high enough reliability to be effective when you DO report. While this should not be taken as a stimulus to report needlessly, it may make you think about reporting effectively a bit more often.

A LOT of stars alerts the staff to review it, for "Featured Question" or "Best of Answers.

The only thing I can think of is to go in your "Profile" and than click on " Edit my info " and than under "Email Communications from Yahoo Answers check the box where it says to email you when you have a new answer, or a violation or that you were picked as best answer|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	You probably accidentally clicked some incoming Yahoo Answers email as SPAM rather than deleted it. That is the usual reason for this. Try checking your SPAM folder or TRASH to find an old one, open it, and mark it as NOT SPAM.  If you have an OLD one saved, move it to the SPAM folder, open it there and mark as NOT SPAM. <br>  <br>  Also, check through your BLOCKED ADDRESSES under Options to see if you can find it there. It comes in as "answers-alert@cc.yahoo-inc.co... If you find it on the list, delete it from there. Also, add the address above to your address book for safe-keeping.

1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	I think to be able to put a question to vote, there must be at least 2 answers. However, I think if you let it expire after 4 days from posting it (or 8 days if you have extended its expiration time) it will still go for voting. At this time you will be able to vote for No Best Answer, yet, the  majority of the votes will have the "final decision".<br>  <br>  If you are interested, you are also able to delete your question while it is still Open. <br>  [Use the Edit button underneath your question]|`|XF9596Xraa	Yes-on any amount of answers-if you don't like the answers-then click no best answer&keep on hunting<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <33|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Because if the one answer does not directly provide any help it should not be selected as the best answer.

RvddYKqjaa	Many are incorrect because people are not alike and don't all need the same answer. The burden of responsibility is not on the person who gives an answer, but on the person who asked it, to research and find out if the answer is right for them, or even correct at all. So many myths are handed out as fact on this list. So many people jump in with a Yes or No, and don't even know what the question is. A person can't know if all questions are answered correctly or not, but a person can use the information he receives to make an informed decision.|`|1tLmTjBxaa	its basically should be used for social networking,like does he like me,or what is your favourite food...so therez nothing like right or wrong scientific answers|`|RhkKGsipaa	Obviously there are no guarantees some answers  could receive a best answer and still be incorrect.  it just goes to show you can't believe everything you see on the internet nor of course in any media,be it radio, t.v. or the press.|`|eClNdscoaa	if it is on the internet, it is probably not correct.  that's not correct of course, but it's also not a bad outlook -- it's safer to assume that people do not have your best interests at hand.  also, please don't take this as an insult, but it could be considered foolish to trust life changing decisions to strangers on the internet.  "better safe than sorry" and "when in doubt, don't" are two creeds i live by.    a clergy, therapist, financial planner, school counsellor, close friend or their parent would be better for advice on life-changing situations.|`|EvZTXRXBaa	I think they are correct...
suPD7c3gaa	The best way is to click on their avatar to see if they allow email.  If they do, you, of course, also have to have chosen to allow email, or you wouldn't be able to email within Yahoo! answers.  All email addresses remain anonymous at all times when emailing through Yahoo! Answers.<br>  <br>  Some might suggest you respond by using the edit feature with your question. If you do that, you risk getting reported for chatting.  Yahoo! Answers isn't like many other forums/message boards where there can be a continuous thread to a comment or question.

Go to multimedia, mark "show pictures", click "ok". <br>  #2: Check your anti-virus and/or firewall security settings, they may be too strict. Go to where it says "disable web bugs", unmark it/ turn it off. (Web bugs are tiny images on a web page used for tracking purposes. But if you checked "disable web bugs", also no other images embedded in e-mail txt will show).<br>  #3: Your IE security settings may be set too high, thus not letting you access the web site which hosts the pic. To solve this in IE click "tools", click "internet options", go to security, mark "default level".<br>  #4: If you are not online and the image is hosted on a website, you'll also see the little red Xs. Go online and try again! <br>  #5: Are you using Windows XP and have the service pack 2 installed? Is Outlook Express your mail prog? After installing the SP2 a security option automatically gets turned on which "blocks images and other external content in HTML e-mail". To fix this go to tools, click "options", click "security" and unmark the "block images...", then click "okay".<br>  #6: The image mailed to you may be stored on a website which is busy or has other problems. Sometimes people rename their pics or just delete them. Simply try again later and if it doesn't work, tell your contact about your problems and ask them to try again sending you the pic.

This is a yahoo problem there is nothing you can do to fix it.<br>  <br>  The fact is until yahoo gets around to fix this problem your only alternatives are to wait for the fix or use your yahoo avatar.<br>  <br>  Note: this glitch has accured before (5/6 months ago) and it took almost two weeks before the 360 avatars showed.|`|7u77AiBjaa	There are no more ideas. People continually have problems using their Yahoo! 360 picture in Yahoo! Answers. Usually, it's just a matter of patiently waiting for the image to show up. It can take longer than a week. The last delay took about two weeks for many people. Another delay has started - which you are experiencing - only a few days after images from the previous delay began re-appearing.<br>  <br>  You can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Well I suggest getting a new one since what happen.
7u77AiBjaa	FIRST, consider all the possibilities listed below (assuming your 360 was previously activated):<br>  - Sometimes 360 is very slow loading. Really be patient in terms of waiting for the site to load. Click the "Back" button on your browser and keep trying, as I did get an error message a few times before when trying to access my 360 space. Also, they have been known to take pages offline and put them back online with little warning. Thus, you show as "Deleted" to other users temporarily. See the 360 team blog link below for information on that as well as more information about 360 transitioning to an universal profile system.<br>  - Check your firewalls & other security settings to make sure they aren't blocking the page or associated IP addresses for 360.<br>  - If you've had any change in your ISP service (like AT&T Yahoo) that was connected to a 360 account, then the change can cause you to lose access. That means you were using the e-mail address that the ISP gave you instead of a Yahoo ID that you created. Check with those sources to find out the deal. Bottom line: It's best that you use a Yahoo ID that you created rather than one provided through an ISP.<br>  - If you've violated Yahoo Terms of Service (<a href="http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html">http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/uto...</a> ) or 360 Community Guidelines (<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-08.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> ), then that can cause 360 space deletion. There are also Yahoo! Personal Photo Guidelines at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  You should be able to do the following, when you've activated your 360:<br>  - LOG OUT of all Yahoo services<br>  - Go to <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a><br>  - Click the teeny tiny "Sign-in" link on the upper left of the page. After signing in, the page refreshes and you should click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of the page to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Make sure that you are using the Yahoo ID that was used to create your 360 space. The usual methods of accessing 360 are no longer working - i.e. via the Yahoo Toolbar and Y!Messenger (with the exception of the Y!360 plug in).<br>  **************************************...<br>  Now, if you've determined that the above possibilities don''t apply to you or don't work, then you only have five choices:<br>  <br>  1) Try setting up or logging into your 360 space on another computer on a different network - library, your friend's computer...whatever.<br>  <br>  2) Contact CUSTOMER CARE by using this form (<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/general.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> ) to ask them why the 360 part of your Yahoo account is inaccessible, then wait for their response. Although, this is customer service, so you may need to contact them a few times to get a response. When dealing with customer service, sometimes it's necessary to be persistent. You can also call 1-866-562-7219, 1-408-349-1572, 1-408-349-3300 Hours: 8a-5p M-F (Pacific)<br>  <br>  3) Start a new 360 space by creating a new Yahoo account. Log out of all Yahoo services. Go to any Yahoo sign-in page and clicking "Sign Up" on the lower right side (<a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a> , is preferred). Then, once you've created a new account, go to <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> and start creating your new 360 space from there. Click on the "Get Started" button to go through the process. Then, click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page or the 360 main page to enter the space.<br>  <br>  4) Wait to see if Y!360 transitioning to the universal profile system will help your situation. Read more about that here: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360</a> .<br>  <br>  5) Give up on Yahoo! 360 and use another social networking service.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Answers. Usually, it's just a matter of patiently waiting for the image to show up. The last delay took about two weeks for many people depending on when they tried to adjust or add their 360 image. Another delay has started - which you are experiencing - only a few days after images began re-appearing.<br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just choose the 360 image option in your Yahoo! Answers profile and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes the adjustment. If you would prefer not to wait, then use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image (at least for now).<br>  <br>  Otherwise after a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> .

suPD7c3gaa	What?  Whose ignoring violations?  Y!A doesn't ignore reports.  Sometimes they don't feel they are violations.  Or have those violations even been reported?  Have you seen posts that offend you and sure they are violations?  If so, did you report them?  If you didn't report them, them you are the cause of them still being there.  We as members moderate the site.  Sometimes that privilege is abused and questions or answers are unjustly reported.  But if you see something you are sure is a violation, then it is your responsibility to report it.  If I'm not answering your questions, then you have to provide at least some information explaining what you are asking.  It's definitely not clear.  We don't report Yahoo!  Its' their site!  And they're letting us use it... for free!!|`|9burAkplaa	I know this is a bummer, dude, but maybe they ignore it because what you're reporting aren't violations. Just a thought.

Dial up is just far to slow to use any Messengers and you will not be able do use any of the features that Yahoo!Messenger or any other messenger has. You really need at least a DSL connection.

aLZKicieaa	If on your payment terms, you wrote payment  must be sent immediately when the auction ends and the buyer did not send payment right away. You have the right to cancel the sale. However, if you did not specify this, then you cannot cancel the sale.<br>  <br>  However, you can always talk to the low bidder and tell them the item is no longer available for sale and usually they will agree. Just say / write it in a positive way, so they don't give you a negative feedback right away. I know Iam not supposed to say this, but a white lie wouldn't hurt. <br>  <br>  The other answerer is correct, since the sale was a contract. You must treat it as a legal contract. But like I said, if the bidder agrees to withdraw his/her bid...then you can relist the product.

Your answer was considered 'not an answer' and therefore qualified as 'pointgaming' (posting only to get 2 points). That is a valid violation.<br>  <br>  If you can't specficially answer a person's question, don't. If you think the person is violating the rules, report them, but don't post an answer telling them to stop doing it.

AA10677333	I totally agree. Yahoo! Answers should definitely take this into consideration. One of the community guidelines should be "Search before you ask". And by doing so, the inquirers will eventually narrow down and refine the questions from the missing pieces of the past answers. As a result, the "answerers" can answer more precisely to the specific questions.<br>  <br>  As some people have pointed out, some answers will change over time with the same questions, and in fact all answers do. The key thing to remember is letting the "answerers" know what is outdated and missing in the past answers (ignore only if it is too obvious)|`|pTERJdzQaa	I agree with you that the same question are constantly and repetitively being asked, and they do make it hard for unique questions to get noticed.<br>  <br>  I have to this though: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS STUPID QUESTIONS!!!!<br>  <br>  You can't flag something that does not exist.|`|9Oa1kv7Zaa	People don't want to take the time to do that.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	I don't know wish we could sometimes|`|YnCUyvK7aa	Some users are just lazy [sorry, but it's true].<br>  <br>  Some might not know how.<br>  <br>  Some might want to see if they get different answers.

7u77AiBjaa	Again, this is a common issue. Many people have chosen to have the "My 360 Profile" link displayed in their Yahoo! Answers profile. What used to lead to Yahoo! 360, now leads visitors to the Yahoo! Profile because Yahoo! Answers decided to make the link go there automatically (particularly for new Yahoo accounts) in lue of the Yahoo! 360 service eventually closing. Currently, parts of Yahoo! 360 are migrating to the Yahoo! Profile.<br>  <br>  So, if you want people to go to your TRUE 360 profile, put a link to it in the "About Me" section of your Yahoo! Answers profile. It's just another aspect of a transitional process.<br>  <br>  UPDATE: Although, it also appears that your Yahoo! 360 service was recently activated. In this case, it can take some days for Yahoo! Answers to recognize that you have activated that service. So, you can also check back next week to see if your automatic link switches to leading to your 360 space. If not, just add your 360 link to the "About Me" section.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	There is some speculation about that, as it happens to many on the site. Are you using a 'regular' Yahoo email (@yahoo.com) or one of the 'new' ones like @ymail.com? That may be the reason.

Why would you want to read someone else's text messages in the first place? That is so wrong. <br>  If you don't trust someone then just quit your relations ship with that person. No matter what kind of relation ship you have with that particular person, if there is no trust there is no good relation ship in the first place. Do you think the person whose messages you are trying to read would love the fact that you are distrusting him/her and that you are trying to snoop around in their privacy? Every person has a right for some privacy and you have to respect that. You don't want others to snoop around your stuff in sneaky ways. Do you? You really need to change your attitude and move on or you need to have a serious talk with that person. You will just create a lot of problems for yourself and this is really an unhealthy behavior.

jKfV6DoOaa	Sing into your Yahoo!Messenger and click on the top left corner into the square box where your avatar or picture goes after you chose it. <br>  Once you click on that it will open a little window and there you click on "Display Image" and this will open up another window and there you click on "Share my Avatar" so your friends can see your avatar once you crate it. Click on "Customize..." It will open up the Yahoo!Avatars web page and there you can choose Appearance, Apparel, Extras, Backgrounds, Branded and you can also safe several Avatars in "My Favorites".<br>  So you can make an Avatar for every season or for all kind of different occasions etc....You can be creative. You can also set different moods and then your Avatar has a different facial expression. Just experiment with it and have fun. Hope I could help you out. Have a great day.
2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	There is no option for that on Yahoo Answers avatars. You would have to create one someplace else and use the 360 site to post it as an avatar here.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Actually, there is a very simple 'back door' way to answer questions when you are blocked and many trolls know the secret (unfortunately). The YA staff really does not answer here anymore. As for deleting people, that is done due to reports of violations. If she is maintaining illegal multiple accounts, she MAY be able to do that -- or she may have friends that she is ganging up with to do that.<br>  <br>  When she posts answers to your questions from blocked accounts, report the answer, type 'Blocked User answering' to alert the REAL YA staff -- and hopefully, they will eventually get rid of her.<br>  <br>  If she does it repeatedly, you can clicking the 2nd button (illegal) and report her for harassment. That tends to be taken a bit more seriously. State that this has been happening for a while.

suPD7c3gaa	You didn't find anything in a Google search because there is no such thing as "Yahoo points".  There are Yahoo! Answers points.  If you got an alert saying you received 10 points, you should click on your avatar to get to your profile. Then click on the "Activity Details" tab. That will tell you the last 6 actions to your account.  So that should tell you how you received 10 points.  It was likely because one of your answers was chosen as a Best Answer, which is worth 10 points.<br>  <br>  You DO NOT receive points for asking questions as another answer indicated.  You also can not "spend" them in any way.  Points are merely and incentive to encourage us to answer more, helping people solve problems.  Click on the link below.

YnCUyvK7aa	This might be better placed in the Reptiles category under Pets.<br>  <br>  But I've owned a few turtles and a tortoise, so I might be able to direct you to some information.<br>  <br>  No, they don't need to live in tanks.  The largest tortoises are too big to fit.  If it's warm enough , they can be kept outdoors in a fenced or sunken pen during the summer, but they'll dig several feet down, so the fence or wall has to go down that far.  You also have to protect them from raccoons, cats and other animals that can get into their pen.<br>  <br>  They can live anywhere from 25 to over a 100 years with proper care.<br>  <br>  You can find them for sale at many pet stores.  Not in the winter though, if it's cold, pet suppliers won't ship reptiles.  You can also buy them at reptile shows, and the price will probably be cheaper.  You might find a better variety too.<br>  <br>  Some places where you can research the kinds and their care.<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.chelonia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chelonia.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/features.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsnake.com/features.html</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You can find a calendar of reptile shows at this website.  <a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/events.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsnake.com/events.html</a> just look for something near you.  They also list breeders in their classifies, and have animals for sale.  But I'd wait to get something you could actually see before buying it.

YnCUyvK7aa	Most reports are just about facts.  It stands out when you can relate what you're writing about to a personal experience.<br>  <br>  Has anyone in your family ever needed to go to a dietician?  If so, why?  ["If it weren't for help from her dietician, my grandmother might not be alive today.  She suffers from diabetes/hypertension/high cholesterol and without changing how and what she ate, her doctors thought she might need to have a limb amputated/have a stroke/have another heart attack.]  Don't lie, but this can show why the rest of your report is important.<br>  <br>  Or do you have a family member that's a dietician?  Ever thought of being 1? <br>  <br>  If none of the above, how about just your impression of how important they can be knowing what you do about them after your research?

Now the only way they are deleted is when other users report them for violating the rules. Customer Care will take care of that part.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	No, they won't, sorry. I've explained to many people, over time. ALL resolved and 'in voting' Q&A belong to the YA database permanently. Closing your Yahoo email account will not delete the Q&A that were posted from that account; it simply makes that YA account inaccessible to YOU to use.

Prominently displayed are a fax number, a snail mail address and a contact link for Live Support. When you are talking about your child - is he/she younger than 13? I didn't look up the TOS (terms of service) for the site, but I suspect that you have to be at least 13 to sign up, so if your child is any younger, that may help in getting the account deleted.
