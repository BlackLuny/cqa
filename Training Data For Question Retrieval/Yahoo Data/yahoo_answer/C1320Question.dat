20090202104912AA6TMNk	Social Science;Psychology	Would you agree that I am a waste of life? Should I end it?	It will be a year in March that I've been in this bad situation.  The job I worked for 5 years had gone out of business.  Since then, I've been working a **** job at popular retail clothing store barely making over minimum wage.  It's just enough to pay my car note and insurance.  I spend a lot of time looking for other employment but so far, no luck.  I spend nights in my car or at cheap motels.  I don't have family and few friends, I'm too embarrassed to tell them the truth.        Besides that, when I was eight, my mother was murdered infront of me.  Growing up, I was shuffled around a lot.  My unstable childhood and witnessing my mothers murder created a lot of issues for me.  I feel like I'm a waste of life and I often wish that I could give my life to someone who needs and wants it, like a mother who is dying of cancer.  I'd do it in a heart beat if I could.  It isn't fair that the people who want to live, die and people who want to die, live.        I try to be strong, I try to have faith and believe that something good is going to happen but you can only lie to yourself for so long.  My life has been filled with hurt, pain and misery for sooo long.  I think about giving up all the time.  I stood on a ledge at the top of a parking garage and I thought about jumping, but I couldn't do it and I don't know why.  I want this struggle to be over so badly.        Should I go back, should I jump?

I understand that by opening this question gay bashing and counter bashing is obviously gonna happen and I apologize for any who will be offended.

20090202110634AAJQtLU	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Women, cheating, lying and its the man's fault?	I don't really have a question to ask, I just have a rant.   And when I talk about women being victims I am in no way saying all of us are that way, although we can all get away with it if we want to.   So there's this woman in my life, always will be. She is the mother of my youngest step-son.   When her and my husband were dating she ended up pregnant, there was no love or happiness involved it was more like lets date and wow I got pregnant.   So my husband moved her in, paid off credit cards, paid thousands in cell phone bills, go orders to move where she was going...   All the while she's messing around on him and has the balls to bring another man to the ultra sound...   In the end she moved in with a man while my husband was on deployment and told him he couldn't come to the birth.   Now my husband's son is going on his 3rd 'daddy' and he recently ran up to my husband and said you are Justin and he is my dad (her bf). She complains about him never being there when he was sick, never teaching him anything, and he left her because she didn't have a girl. She even tried to say I did some crazy stuff.   So what I want to know is why a woman would try so hard to alienate a father when they were never married and he's always done his best and treated her nice....   Stop being a victim and blaming your unhappyness on my husband and stop trying to find the boy a dad when he already has one.
20090202110716AARcHRt	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you project your sexuality onto others?	"It's funny that a lot of gay and bisexual men think most men have some attraction to other men, and most straight men think most women have an attraction to other women."      Another user recently made that interesting conjecture, which suggests that many of us simply find it difficult to comprehend anyone being NOT being sexually attracted to the people we're sexually attracted to (e.g. "I find women attractive; how could anyone not find women attractive?!  Straight women and gay men must be faking their attraction to men, or at least have some secret attraction to women.").      Do you project your sexuality onto people?  Do you find it difficult to believe that anyone could have fundamentally different sexual interests from your own?

Though I am sure many people think straight men are the same all I can do is speak about my own experience.   I am pretty open minded so in the past I have tried to have fantasies about men. It just didn't work and I would always have to change it to a women before I could really get going so to speak.   Why do some people think men are as capable of bisexuality as some women?    The Kinsley scale even though I don't really think you can put things like this on a scale has confirmed that men tend to be straight.   why do some people have a problem with this?

20090202112344AATvsdn	Social Science;Psychology	Am I weird for feeling this way? Is it unusual?	I actually find most people somewhat attractive. I rarely think that someone is ugly. Especially not women. Is that strange? lol And if they are somewhat unattractive (to me), why should that bother me? I never comment on, or care about what other people are wearing. I give compliments, but never criticism. Not because I don't want to hurt someone's feelings, but I just simply find it bothersome and a waste of time. lol But it seems that most people are the exact opposite. They constantly comment on other people's looks, and they won't shut up. They always have an opinion. Isn't that exhausting? What do people get out of it?

20090203164303AAMVB8b	Social Science;Psychology	I want it to hurt more?	Ok I asked a question a few days ago about having pain in my lower leg. It originally happened becuase I got nailed just above the ankle by a our #1 Varsity pitcher. Although it is not swollen and it is hardly bruised it still hurts a lot, especially when touched, or when i extend it while sitting or laying down. I know there is probably nothing wrong with it but i am sick of it hurting. I feel like I want it to hurt more, and I want there to be something wrong with it so that it can heal like under a cast or something. Not to mention I have always wanted to be on crutches. I just feel like I am going through this pain that is going to continue unless something is done. I have even prayed that something will happen that will cause it to break so that it can heal. Dont say I should rest it because softball season has started and I am starting Varsity so it is impossible to rest it, we have two a days. I don't know what to do. I want to hurt it more so i can rest it, but i dont know how to. Just maybe somethign that will put me out for like 4 weeks or something. Don't call me a psycho or anything, becasue I am not. I just want it to heal by making it worse so that I can actually go to the doctor and have something be wrong with it. I wouldnt even mind surgery.

So he saw it and now he's threatening to tell everyone about my text messages unless I give him head. and he's very serious. But the only thing is I have a boyfriend and don't want to do that. But I also don't want anyone to know about what was in my phone. It's been bothering me all day.

20090203165641AAOroU0	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are feminists more likely to be abusive towards their sons?	There seems to be two main possibilities of how feminists raise their sons. They are either verbally & physically abusive towards their sons due to their hatred of males, or, the second possibility is that they brainwash their sons to feel guilty for being a male and teach them that women must always be put on a pedestal & worshipped. Or, they could be raised both ways.      If the male child has a sister, his abuse would be more pronounced & evident, as he'd see his sister receiving preferential treatment in contrast to his own treatment.      What do you think?

20090203171038AAeYUBo	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	So I had this dream.?	I'm 19 years old and I would like to know what my dream meant. So I had this dream; I find myself on a small airplane and I'm at the controls. I'm still myself. (I have no experience flying) I was in fact flying. I don't know where I was flying to or from, but I think I was escaping something not sure. On the plane there were 5 adults including myself and 14 orphan children. I remember looking out and seeing that the tail wing was cracked. The plane was going down. I know that they say that in dreams if you are flying you've recently overcome something. This dream was not about flying, it was about crashing. After a few minutes of free falling I realize I have to crash land this thing or every one will die. I manage to put it down in one piece, I don't remember the specifics of how I did it. I look around the plane and see all the orphan kids lying on the floor under blankets, no one was hurt and when I got out of the plane I landed on what appeared to be the street I live on now(out side of my dream), I could recognize certain things like houses and the street and what not. I then go over to look at the cracked tail wing and I remember being really pissed; so much so that I punched it and it broke off. That was the last thing I remember. Dream part Two. This dream has nothing to do with the plane crash but it is somewhat similar and it was in the same night as the first dream. I'm driving my mothers car I was about to pull into the drive way of my old house (the house I lived in before the one in the plane story) but I saw my mom pulling in and I didn't want her to see me. She was driving the same car, some how we had two. I don't know why I didn't want her to see me I just remember driving down the hill past the house to avoid her. I start picking up speed going down this street. I notice two police cars in front of me at a stop sign. I go to hit the breaks only they wont budge, I have to swerve last minute to miss the two cop cars and go barreling into the extremely busy intersection. I remember thinking that I was going to be in a lot of trouble; one for crashing the car and; two for running a stop sign in front of two cops. (the thought of dieing never occurred to me, not sure if that is relevant) Every thing was happening in slow motion, I was the only one acting in real time. I decide my best option is to drive off the road and into this large field (this field dose not exist out side of my dream) to try and stop the car. I do so and was able stop the car. No one was hurt and neither was the car. I awoke with a violent jerk of my body and that was the end.      So the question is. What does it mean? And is it strange that I had TWO dreams about "Safely" crashing in the same night?

Yahoo - I've said this before, You are purposely annoying us with your content.

I'm trying to explain Gestalt Psychology/Theory in a way that I'm not plagiarizing from anyone and that I understand what I'm talking about.        Gestalt theory is basically a theory of perception.  It suggests that people view objects and events as a whole rather than in pieces.        Is there anything I'm missing from that?  Am I a little off? Or does that pretty much sums it up?

20090202154219AAd7nZP	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do SOME men discount the pains many women go through during birth?	I've noticed that SOME men on here like to paint childbirth as this wonderfully and blessedly easy experience for women. Any pain experienced is merely a fabrication and an attempt to get attention.      How can these few men discount the real pain some women go through when they experienced things like ripped perneniums(the skin between your genitals and anus)bleeding stretch marks, babies stuck in the birth canal, baby pressing against your spine, lungs and/or bladder, tearing vaginal stitches, c sections gone wrong and actually feeling the whole thing, not being able to afford an epidural, infections from giving birth, having a c section or having sex too soon after.      Not every pregnancy and subsequent birth is the same but why do some feel the need to discount the true pain and horror some women go through?

At church there are these 3 boys who have it pretty bad. The 4 year old gets all the attention from the dad, while the others don't. I at the moment, am also having it pretty bad with work and such, so I cant be a 100% active person in their lives. So on Sundays I spend time with them at church when I get the chance. Not just that It might just be a small talk or I might sit there with the 4 year old, while he colors his coloring book.The oldest has it even worst. He is currently in the hospital, recovereing from a nervous breakdown, and still has suicidal thoughts. I have made a promise to my self, that even if it takes years I am gonna stop him from doing anything like that, and I am gonna try to be a part in the lives. I don't care about my life, but only theirs. I know the things I do seem pedophilia, but really that's not what I am trying to do. I would never harm a child like that, I would rather die. So do the things I do make me a pedophile? and is it right for me to step up for these boys, even if its a small part?

20090202155547AAZFw81	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What could this dream mean? Very creepy.?	Last night, I dreamed that I was driving at night with my girlfriend and we heard a crash. As we drove a little farther up the road we noticed a train passing overhead on a bridge (not the kind where cars travel, but only trains), and a car on the road. The car had been hit by the train.      I slowed down to see the wreckage, and I saw that the man inside the car was still alive, and moving slightly. I stopped my car and ran to the other man's car to help. When I looked inside, there was a stereo equipped with a screen. I don't know if it matters, but the screen was about maybe 15 inches?      On the screen, there was a scene inside a hospital, with a newborn baby. At first, I was thinking that the man's wife had given birth, and for some reason he couldn't be there, so they had a sort of live feed from the hospital to the car so he could at least see his child.       I looked at him, and he was still moving slightly, and then I looked back at the screen. At this point, the camera was zoomed in on the baby, but its skin was gray, as with dead people. It had many cuts on its face, and its mouth taped shut. It looked almost...evil? Then the camera started to zoom out from the baby, and it was sitting on the man's shoulders in the car. I looked at the man, and the baby wasn't there, but when I looked back in the screen, there it was. I was also visible in the screen.       Then IM's started popping up on the car's screen saying "HELP ME", and they were making the sounds that IM's make. At that point I woke up, only to ACTUALLY HEAR the IM sounds coming from my laptop. My laptop is my alarm in the morning, except that isn't the sound that is supposed to be played. I have an actual song as my alarm. Later, I found out that I deleted the song from its folder, and since the alarm couldn't find the file, it was making a strange sound instead. But I do find it really strange the way it happened.      When I picked my girlfriend up this morning, I told her I had a crazy dream, and she said she had one too. I asked her to tell me hers first, and she told me:       "It was at night and I was looking out my window, and there was a lady in the street, running around screaming "HELP ME," pleading at the doors of houses, only to get no response from anyone. I texted you and asked if you had gotten home okay, and after you texted me back, I looked up and I was outside your apartment with you. We were in front of your door. You had your hand on the handle, but you were shaking and it seemed like you were scared to open it. I turned around and saw the lady running and screaming "HELP ME" still. When I turned to you, you disappeared, and your car was gone. I couldn't get into your place, and I didn't have my car, so I didn't know how to get home. All of a sudden, a police car came and I flagged him down. I got in the back seat and he said he would give me a ride back to my apartment. The lady was sitting in the front seat, with her hair covering her face, so I couldn't make out any of her features. When I asked the officer if he could see her, he said he couldn't.      Then she woke up.      I asked a friend of mine today, and she said that it could have something to do with us having a child?      Just to give some background information, we're very happy together, and we are planning on getting engaged very soon. Neither of us wants kids. Although she never wants kids, I'm not sure if I will one day or not.      Thank you to anyone who can interpret this! :) (P.S. maybe our dreams aren't related, but it just seemed strange because there was a woman screaming "HELP ME" in her dream, similar to the IM's popping up on the screen in my dream saying "HELP ME", and in my dream, I thought that it could be the baby's mother saying "HELP ME" through the IM's? I don't even know what to make of it, really. It's so weird.)

Let the real rate of interest (r) be 5%. Now let the individual enjoy an income stream which gives him $100,$150 and $200 dollars in periods 1,2,3.    a) what will be the individual's optimal consumption choice in the 3 periods?   b) what happens if B increases to 1?

I am having a really hard time making peace with my limitations in life (specifically educationally and career wise).     Educationally - no matter how hard I work and how hard I try, I will never hold an pristigious degree or even a master's or professional degree. My brain is not wired that way.     Career-wise - I want to enter professions that are very hard to break into and I have tried in the past and I keep failing.     I am finding it very difficult to make peace with my limitations and move forward.    Is there anyone else out there like this?

I'm 15 years old and i'm quiet in class and usually i have my ipod in and i'm finishing my work. I get good grades and i focus on my work 100 percent of the time in class. I have alot of friends and know quite a bit of people because they add me on msn or start conversations with me. I know i'm not ugly and when i go home i sing, play guitar and usually do my own thing. I was just curious, do girls find the class clown more attractive than somebody like me who doesn't talk much in class. I'm not really shy i just don't feel the want to talk alot. When i'm at work and stuff i talk quite a bit, not alot, but i do.
20090202162139AAq7ZFu	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What would u think when you saw her?	Your friend is incredibly quiet, soft-spoken and shy. She's sweet but she seems to keep to herself a lot and she seems very very shy. She accepted you as a friend on myspace and when you looked at her page, you discovered that she's pretty open and honest, revealing personal things in a survey, displaying family pictures of her and her younger cousins, she seems to love kids, and she even has videos of her playing an instrument and being a little silly. She's pretty talented and displays a warm and friendly side. But when you see her, she's just incredibly shy and quiet.      What would u think when you saw her in person?  Why do you think she's so shy if she has all of these positive attributes?

My mom is such a beast at trying to make me be the best at everything (legit, everything)      Like, today I was accepted to my 2nd choice college (I didn't hear from my 1st choice yet), and my mom didn't even care, and only complained about how it was in the city and wasn't top-notch top 50 colleges and stuff like that...and that kinda bothered me since I was freakin' happy! and she was the one who dropped out of a community college.     Haha, that's ok though cuz I have my peeps to be happy for me      She also seemed pretty sad when I told her I didn't think I wanted to be a surgeon anymore, but rather an ocologist.  I actually think all she cared about was the money and whether or not I could support her when she's about to croak.        So, do you ever feel like parents place too much emphasis on their kids' success, and do you feel like they do it in correlation with their own self-interests...like why do u they do it?      Thanks

I felt like she was accusing me of purposely wanting to download a virus on a computer with my IPod, questioning my character.
