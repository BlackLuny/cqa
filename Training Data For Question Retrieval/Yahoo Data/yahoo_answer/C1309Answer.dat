hO7g5Y9taa	Simple. Our solar system formed from a dense gas cloud riddled with remnants of a much older system that was blown apart by a super nova.  Our sun and Jupiter and Saturn formed at the same time. Jupiter and Saturn failed to accumulate enough mass for fusion to take place, so they remain gas giants. Earth along with the other rocky planets formed when the heavy masses smashed together while in orbit around the sun. 4.5 billion years later you typed your question.|`|AA11564934	the same thing we are all taught in school, there is no credible alternate theory.    Big bang|`|ViZH5twNaa	Gravity pulled a lot of gasses and heavier material closer together until enough clumped together to initiate fusion within the center of what is now our Sun. All the matter that didn't fall into the Sun formed a disk around the Sun. In that disk bits clumped together to form protoplanets. The biggest ones grew quickly until the point they could hold down very light hydrogen gas. They became our solar system's gas giants. The early protoplanets grew and collided (like Theia colliding with Earth to create the Moon) until only 4 remained. Earth was one of those four.    To my knowledge that is the standard model.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	The creation of Earth made many people upset and it is generally considered a bad move.|`|jNzkN6Rnaa	Luck ...Lots of Luck|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	Urwumpe is my hero.

1f441adae4fb82e866cd701dceba26c7aa	1) let's call the rates R1 and R2. The distance is going to be the same going out as coming back, D. There will be 2 times, T1 out and T2 back. The total of T1+T2 must equal 3hrs.  D=R1*T1, D also = R2*T2, and T1+T2 = 3  Set he two rate eqations equal because they both equal the same D  R1*T1 = R2*T2  Use the T1+T2=3 to substitute one of the Ts out. T1 = 3-T2  R1*(3-T2) = R2*T2  600*(3-T2) = 400*T2  You can solve that for T2. Once you have T2 and the rate, D=400*T2    2) solve in the exact same way as 1). R1 is 1.5km/hr, R2 is 4.5km/h, T1+T2=6. Use the same eqs to solve for D    3) D is 280km. R1 is 40 Time for them is 280/40=7hr.  The second family has 20 minutes less, so T2=6 2/3 hr. Since D=RT, R = D/T = 280 / (6 2/3)

O2QItYAaaa	Revised   The total time of the flight can be calculated as follows    v = v0 - gt   v = v0(sin(x)) - gt   0 = (35 m/s)(sin(30 deg)) - (9.8)t   (9.8t) = 35/2  t = 35/(2*9.8) = 1.79 seconds    You could've also done it your way which was to take it by its component parts    V0x = (35 m/s)(cos(30 degrees)) = 30.31 m/s  V0y = (35 m/s)(sin(30 degrees)) = 17.5 m/s     At the highest point of the trajectory the velocity is 0.    Vy = V0y - gt  0 = V0y - gt  t = (V0y - 0)/g = (17.5 m/s - 0)/9.8 = 1.79 seconds     Since it takes twice the amount of time for the rock to reach its full flight its 1.79 x 2 = 3.58 seconds. The reason for this is because the rock takes as much time to go up as it went down. The range is therefore     x(t) = V0x*t = (30.31 m/s)(3.58 s) = 108.5 meters     Trajectories are supposed to be symmetrical. What you did was assumed that the rock would be thrown 70 + Vy(max) from rest under the action of gravity. That works fine for an object that is not in a trajectory     I'm suprised that we used different methods but got the same answer for the last part.     When the rock strikes the ground at s = + 70 meters its velocity is determined by    vf^2 = vi^2 + 2as   vf^2 = (35 m/s)^2 + 2(9.8)(70 - 0)   vf = 50.96 m/s     When the rock strikes the ground it has a velocity of 50.96 m/s
CYtMRC4eaa	The main function of the nucleus is to direct cell activities, which it does by causing the production of specific enzymes to carry out chemical reactions.    By removing the nucleus, the "blueprints" of cell function are missing.    The reason the cell did not die immediately is that there was still enough mRNA to allow production of the necessary enzymes.  If a new nucleus can be reintroduced into the cell quickly enough, it can "take over" the job of instructing the cell how to make those enzymes again.  If too much time goes by, the mRNA is all used up, no more enzymes are made, and the chemical reactions required for life stop.

S8H5yYcoaa	First, let's find out how much money is in the bank:  seven quarters and three dimes more is $7.35, so if we call the amount currently in the bank x,  7(.25) + 3(.10) + x = 7.35, so  x + 2.05 = 7.35:  x = 7.35 - 2.05 = $5.30    With twenty-six coins summing to this amount, if you have q quarters then you have 26-q dimes.  You want to find q such that this sums to $5.30:  q(.25) + (26-q)(.10) = 5.30  .25q + 2.60 - .10 q = 5.30  .15 q = 5.30 - 2.60 = 2.70, so  q = 2.70/.15 = 18    Then you have 18 quarters and 26-18 = 8 dimes in the bank!    Edit to add: Oh, sorry, I missed that you're specifically looking for a system of linear equations.  In that case, don't solve at each step - use the information all at once to get equations in multiple variables about the system.    Since you have 26 coins, if you have q quarters and d dimes, one equation you get is q + d = 26.  Your current balance, x, is made up of these quarters and dimes: q(.25) + d(.10) = x  You also know that your current balance along with 7 quarters and 3 dimes makes $7.35, so x + 7(.25) + 3 (.10) = 7.35    Then your system has three equations, with unknowns q, d, and x:  q + d = 26  q(.25) + d(.10) = x  x + 7(.25) + 3 (.10) = 7.35    You'd solve for this similarly to what I did above - it's basically just isolating variables and substituting.|`|vyIWfqX9aa	First find how much money was in the bank before he put in the extra coins. It comes out to be $5.30. Then set up one equation as (.25)x+(.1)y =5.30 and a second one as x+y=26. Subtract and you get there are 8 dimes and 18 quarters
FkuFpYmMaa	The vast majority of (whole) bodies that are donated go to gross anatomy labs, usually for medical school.  The head is usually removed to begin with, then medical students dissect the body.  This helps them "figure out" the human body.  This indirectly "helps people," in a way, because these are future doctors that may treat us.    Organ donation, however, has a more direct impact.  You can help up to nine people live and up to two people see.  Very, very few medications rule out organ and tissue donation.  Your kidneys and lungs may be ruled out due to kidney stones (which can lead to kidney failure) and smoking.  However, this still leaves several organs, bones, skin, corneas, etc.  Organ and tissue donation (including donating the skin!) has absolutely no effect on your funeral; you can still have it with a closed casket and in a timely manner.  It's easiest to look at this way:  18 people in the U.S. die every day while waiting for organs on a waiting list.  Not many people die because someone didn't donate a body to science (Not that I'm knocking this option! See my "source" section for why I'm a little biased.).|`|CrYc4TTSaa	Organ don is so much better.  Whole body generally goes to science and not regular people.  Organ goes to a variety of real needs

6uoseXfqaa	You are correct in suggesting that higher temperature tends to speed up chemical reactions, so if you have two identical samples of marble exposed to the same acidic precipitation conditions, in similar environments (i.e. both are equally sheltered from wind, etc.), then yes, the sample in the higher-temperature environment will certainly erode faster.    You could illustrate this is the laboratory by placing a sample of marble (each being the same, i.e. two pieces of the same original rock), and placing them in a weak acid solutions of equal pH. If you keep one of the solutions at a higher temperature, that one should dissolve the marble faster than the other.    The problem is, not all marble is the same. Marbles having more Mg in their crystal structures (dolomite) are more resistant than marbles of the Ca end member (calcite). Also, exposure to wind seems to be a big factor in the rates of erosion, based on observation of historic artifacts and buildings exposed to similar conditions. In one of the links you will find an example of a building that is more weathered on one side, presumably due to greater exposure to the abrasive action of wind-borne particles.    Here is a link to a public GSA document, which goes into considerable detail about the weathering of marbles, and another from a chemistry lab at Washington University which explains the chemical processes involved.    http://w3.gsa.gov/web/p/hptp.nsf/02e2bfa...    http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~edudev/L...    And here are some 2007 isopleth maps showing the types, amounts, and locations of acidic rainfall for that year in the United States. Of course, marbles will erode faster in areas which receive the most acidic rain in the greatest amounts.    http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/isopleths/maps2...    More information could probably be found from organizations charged with the preservation of historic stuff, like marble statues, buildings, and the like. But this should get you started.

7ZMHBdNlaa	1.   The cell membrane contains many integral membrane proteins, which pepper the entire surface. These structures, which can be visualized by electron microscopy or fluorescence microscopy, can be found on the inside of the membrane or the outside.    2.  The 'head' of a phospholipid is hydrophilic (attracted to water) wheras the hydrophobic 'tails' repel water.     The hydorophobic head contatins the negatively charged phosphate group, and may contain other polar groups. The hydrophobic tail usually consists of long fatty acid hydrocarbon chains.    in a bilayer such as a cell membrane.[1] Lipid bilayers occur when hydrophobic tails line up against one another, forming a membrane with hydrophilic heads on both sides facing the water.    bellow is an image of a plasma membrane  http://www.sdxresearch.com/images/cellli...

SOEauEYcaa	If there is 5% tax and 20% tip, you can add these and get a total of 25% extra that you are paying.    To find out 25% of the $20.88, you multiply:  20.88 x 0.25 = $5.22    So to find the total price, you add this tax and tip amount to your original amount:  20.88 + 5.22 = $26.10    If you and two friends are eating, there are a total of 3 of you.  So you need to take the total amount $26.10 and divide it by 3 to get the amount that each person has to pay.|`|AA12223669	$20.88 (10% would be $2.09 ... so 5% would be half that and 20% would be double that)    5%: $1.04    20% tip: $4.17    Total: $28.09 / 3 = $9.36 with one person paying $9.37|`|MffNO4Rmaa	First, you must find out how much tax is. Find the percentage (5%) as a decimal and add 1. Multiply it by the food bill.  1.05 X 20.88 = 21.92  That is the price of the food with tax    Next, you must factor in the tip. Find the percentage (20%) as a decimal and add 1. Multiply it by the price of the food with tax that you found in the previous step.  1.2 X 21.92 = 26.30    Now, divide this by 3 because there are three people paying for the food.  26.30 / 3 = 8.76    Everyone should pay $8.76
JQqvohOXaa	1.  The problem seems to be incomplete.  If you assume that the pressure of the O2 gas is 1.00 atmosphere you can use the ideal gas law to solve the problem.  The equation is:  PV = nRT where P is pressure in atmospheres, V is volume in liters, n is number of moles, R is the gas constant = 0.08206 L.atm/K.mol, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvins.    T = 25 oC + 273 = 298 K.      Number of moles = n = PV/RT.  You need to work this out.     Next, you find mass.  Mass is found by multiplying moles times the molar mass of O2.    Good Luck.    2.  This is easier.  The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L.  This means that you can find the number of moles of the Cl2, chlorine, by first finding the number of moles. If 1.00 mole of Cl2 = 22.4 L at STP, then you can find the moles of Cl2.    Then find mass just like you did in problem 1 using the molar mass of chlorine, Cl2.

0jzPpMZtaa	Transfermations like these squeeze or expand the graph or shift it up or down or right and left.  The easiest way to see how is to visualize where -1,0, and 1 are mapped with and without the transformations.  It is best to treat the transformations one step at a time.    For example h(-(x-1)) is h(b(a(x))) where a is x-1, b is -x.    h(b(*)) maps b(*) to b(-*)  b(a(*)) maps * to * -1   so   h(b(a(*)) maps to the h image of -(*-1).    so h(0) goes to h(1)  h(-1) goes to h(2) and  h(1) goes to h(0)    So h slides right and then reflects about x = 1.    For example, y = x^3 would inflect at x = 1  and the cubic would go to +inf on the left and -inf on the right.

Isotopes are the same type of atom with a different number of neutrons, so only the weight is different.  There can be isotopes for any atom, metal or non-metal.

jG4ZFTC8aa	If you double the sides, the area will quadruple.    Compare a 3x3 square with a 6x6 square. the sides doubled, but the area went from 9 to 36.  So, in your problem, the surface area will quadruple.    360*4 =     This happens becuase area measures square units.  and 2 squared = 4  If the sides tripled, then the area would increase by 9 times (3squared)    Extra...

9fdb8309a82d0fd5cf22e900d46f7662aa	Compounds do not have a charge.  amino acids do not have charges.    an amino acid has a COOH  on one end and a NH2 on the other.     an hydrogen molecule is unusual in that after it gives away its only electron, it is a bare proton. H+ is a bare proton, and that is what causes acids to have their characteristics.  and why they are called proton donors.  ions have charges. when combining in a compound, they match up the + and -, to make no total charge. Yes, a positive charge is due to having an extra proton, but it is not a proton donor, it is an ion made by the loss of electrons.  negatively charged ions are made from gaining electrons.
1Ox7si0eaa	I am not fond of flash cards. If you need to relate 10 facts, okay. When you get to 100, I predict most students will be lost. In order for you learn organic chemistry, the reactions must make logical sense. Try memorizing the Gettysburg address in Chinese, unless you read and write it, it will be impossible. It will be impossible because you will be trying to memorize Chinese characters to the meaning without a logical connection. In English, the meaning and words connect back to the characters so you can write them. (If you don't agree, just take a random series of numbers or letters and see how many of them you can memorize, not use, just memorize.)     In my classes, I focussed on teaching students how reactions worked and why they worked. If students knew the steps involved, they would know how reactions took place. This is like making the letters of the words have meaning. (If they do, you can memorize a much larger set.) Then, with alkenes, for example, you will realize they all react in a very similar way. You don't have to memorize a new reaction for every instance. You just have to know when reagents are Lewis acids and bases. It is similar for carbonyl chemistry, reductions, oxidations, etc.     By focussing on reactions, my class average increased by 20 percentile points on the ACS organic chemistry exam. I did one other thing, I wrote mechanisms at several levels so students could learn the logic of the reactions, extend this to intermediate level problems, and finally to complete mechanisms.     Disclaimer, I am the author of "A Guide to Organic Chemistry Mechanisms"  (Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble or http://www.curvedarrowpress.com ).|`|zwLbRKKyaa	I took orgo 1 and 2 last year, the best thing to do is    a) Make a chart of the reactions, products, reactants, any conformational changes, etc.  Don't copy one from another source, do it yourself using your book/notes.  It'll take forever but it really pays off.    b) WORK PROBLEMS..... repetition is the only way it'll sink in, there's an infinite amount of ways to trick you on a test, so do as many problems as you can|`|MTziKWnbaa	The best way to learn reactions is to make flash cards. Get some 3x5 notecards. Put the reagents on one side and the product(s) on the other side. Or put the reaction on one side and the conditions on the other side. Now, after you do that, the cards are no good unless you USE them! Repetition is the key to learning reactions. However, it doesn't do much good to sit and look at the cards for 2 hours. Break your time with the cards up into smaller bites. Look at them SEVERAL times every day. For instance, look at 4 or 5 while you eat breakfast. Then look at 4 or 5 before each of your classes. Do this over and over until you know you have a reaction down - then just look at the cards that you're having trouble remembering. Review them ALL at least every 3 or 4 days. I memorized hundreds of reactions this way in grad school.It's not hard, it just takes perseverance. You can also make up little exams for yourself of reactions and then wait 3 or 4 days later and take them - gives you feedback on whether you know the reactions or not. Good luck!

4A6kUcB3aa	Usually we think of infrared light as given off by the sun as being in a wavelength just a bit longer than visible light, specifically longer than red light.

But I will give a little explanation    Oxygen comes from the pulmonary system during inhalation. Oxygen diffuses into the blood capillaries surrounding the alveoli in the lungs    The oxygen present in the glucose is just part of the molecule itself which undergoes a transformation into pyruvate during glycolysis. The pyruvate undergoes further reactions through the link reaction and the Krebs Cycles (all of this takes place in the mitochondria)    My understanding on what oxygen is actually used for is a little fuzzy but I know that oxygen is known as the final acceptor of hydrogen. If you are not on the level to know about NADH + H+ etc then do not worry about this. But if you are, then once the H+ ions have moved back into the matrix via the stalked particle (to produce ATP), then the electrons come back off of the elctron transport chain and turn the H+ ion back into a H atom. Oxygen then reacts with the hydrogen to produce water.    1/2O2 + H2 ----> H2O|`|fTD4Y2RXaa	I think what you are referring to is something called the "Krebs" cycle.

ATP is the basic form of energy that is used in cells.    The oxygen comes from the organism's respiratory system.  The glucose comes from what ever nutritional source that organism uses.  like your Big Mac or your Brussel Sprouts.    Cellular respiration is the process that brings the oxygen and glucose into the cell, thus it is call an aerobic process.  It cannot happen without the presence of oxygen.

It can be cultivated in a temperature range of 10C and 40C with high humidity but growth is retarded at temperatures of 20C and less and more than 35C. Yields are higher when temperatures are above 24C for a considerable period. In cooler climate, the crop requires longer time to mature. Plants exposed to low temperature and humidity during active growth stage show reduced growth and yields. Hot winds blowing in high speed during the summer month's shred and desiccate the leaves.

hx3BRsoXaa	Step 1: Make each angle a set amount.  Smallest angle = x  Midsize angle (smallest angle plus 30) = 30 + x   Largest Angle (2(mid sized angle)+10) = 2(30+x)+10    Step 2:  The whole triangle can only equal a total of 180 degrees.  Add together all the angles and set them equal to 180.  x+30+x+2(30+x)+10 = 180    Step 3:  Distribute the 2 and combine like terms.  x+30+x+60+2x+10 = 180  4x+100 = 180    Step 4: Solve for x.  4x+100 = 180  4x = 80  x = 20    Step 5:  Fill the value of x in for each angle equation and solve.  Smallest angle = x = 20 degrees  Midsized angle = 30 + x -> 30+20= 50 degrees  Largest angle = 2(30+x)+10 -> 2(30+20)+10 = 110 degrees|`|TPpTAKAdaa	Let largest angle= L   Let midsize angle= M  Let smallest angle=S    M=S+30 (because midsize is 30 greater than smallest)  L=2m+10 (becasue largest is twice the midsize plus ten)  L+M+S=180 (all angles of triangle add up to 180 degrees)    So you have S+30+2M+10+S=180    Combine like terms: 2S+40+2M=180  Now plug in M's value from the first equation using substitution:    S+40+2(S+30)=180 Now just solve for S, by distributing the  two:    S+40+2S+60=180 Now combine like terms again:    100+3S=180, now just subtract 100 to both sides, then divide by three:    3S=80  S=26.67    So now you know the smallest angle measures 26.67 degrees.    The next step is to plug in S's value to this  equation:  M=S+30>>>>>>M=26.67+30  So,  add 26.67 and 30, to get M's value. 26.67+30=56.67  M=56.67    Now you just need to find the measure of the largest angle which can simply be done by plugging M and S into the following equation and solving:  L+M+S=180>>>>>L+56.67+26.67=180, so combine like terms:    L+83.34=180.  Now for the final step, subtracting 83.34 from 180..... which is 96.66  L=96.66  M=56.67  S=26.67    You can check this by plugging them all in to the three original equations.|`|1SILUqDtaa	180=x+(x+30)+[2(x+30)+10]  180=x+x+30+2x+60+10  180=4x+100  80=4x  x=20 degrees ---- measure of smallest angle    x+30=20+30=50 degrees ---- measure of midsize angle    2(x+30)+10=2(20+30)+10=40+60+10=110 degrees ---- measure of largest angle    20+50+110=180 degrees|`|sS352szAaa	Let x = measure of mid-sized angle    x + (x - 30) + (2x + 10) = 180  4x - 20 = 180  4x = 200  x = 50    x - 30 = 50 - 30 = 20  2x + 10 = 2(50) + 10 = 100 + 10 = 110|`|vyIWfqX9aa	Mid angle = 50  Small = 20  Large = 110

6uoseXfqaa	You just have to use the specific heat capacities to find your answers.     The first step is to do some conversions to make sure your units are in agreement. What I mean by this is, you are given the specific heat capacities in Joules per GRAM per degree C, and your sample's mass is given in KILOGRAMS. So, step one is to convert 2.505 kilograms to grams by multiplying by 1000 (2.505 kg = 2505 g).    Now, how many mols is that? We will need that information later, but as long as we're doing unit conversions, we might as well get it out of the way now. The molar mass of SO2 is 64 grams (rounded to a whole number to keep the significant digits in check), so in our sample, we have 39 mols of SO2.    Let us also multiply the deltaH of fusion and vaporization by 1000, since they are given in kilojoules. By converting them to Joules, we are not switching units as we do our calclulations, and our totals are easier to keep track of. So the deltaH of fus and vap are 8619 J/mol, and 25730 J/mol, respectively.    Ok, now we can really get started.    Our sample is at the melting point, but we are assuming that it has not already melted. To change phase from a solid to a liquid, we have to use the deltaH(fusion). Basically, the deltaH(fus) is the amount of energy input required to make this phase change happen. Since the deltaH(fus) is 8619 Joules per mol, and we have 39 mols of SO2 in our sample, we need (39 mol x 8619 J/mol) 336,141 Joules of heat energy to complete the phase change.    So, now our solid SO2 is a liquid, at the melting point temperature of -73 C.    Next, we need to vaporize the liquid SO2, which means we have to raise its temperature to its boiling point, and then do one more phase change to complete the experiment. So, first we need to raise the temperature of the SO2 from -73 to -10 C, a difference of 63 degrees.    For this we use the specific heat capacity (s), which says that we need to input 0.995 Joules of heat energy to raise the temperature of one gram of our SO2 by one degree C. Since we have 2505 grams, we need (0.995 J/g*C x 2505 g) 2492 Joules of heat energy to raise our sample's temperature by one degree. We need to raise it by 63 degrees, however, so all together, we need (2492 J/C x 63 C) 149,520 Joules of heat energy to bring our sample to its boiling point.    Since we have already input 336,141 Joules to do the solid-liquid phase change, our total energy input at this point is (336,141 J + 149,420 J) = 485,661 Joules.    ***************************    I don't have the time to complete the rest of the problem, but it is done in the exact same way. Now, you just need to use the deltaH(vap) to convert your sample from the liquid phase to the gas phase, and then use the specific heat capacity (s) of the SO2 gas to raise its temperature from its boiling point at -10 C to its final temperature of 60 C.    When you are done, you simply add all of the energy inputs, and that is your total heat energy required to do the complete phase transformation as stated in the question. You may want to convert back to kilojoules (divide by 1000) when you are done, just to simplify the answer.    Hope that helps.

AA10112320	Good question. Animals have special cells that hold particular pigments, called chromatophores. And within the cell, the pigments are contained in special vesicles, but these are nowhere near as complex as the thylakoids of plant cells.     The name chromatophore derives from the Greek words for "color" (chromo) and "carry" (phoros); it's a general term. Chromatophores receive specific names depending on the pigments they carry; for example, melanophores carry melanins (brown and black pigments), xanthophores carry yellow pigments, etc.   In mammals (including us) there are only melanin-carrying cells, called melanocytes. Too bad for us that we don't have lots of colors, like frogs and lizards!   :-)|`|GQpTI2GWaa	Melanins are found in certain tissues, for example the base of the Iris.

on5yFSsLaa	The fundamental thing you need to know is the formula for the distance between two points on a plane:    sqrt[ (y2-y1)^2 + (x2-x1)^2 ].    Now you will generally have to use this formula for anything you find.     For example, you want to find the locus of points a distance of 4 from the point (1,1).      So you know that:  sqrt[ (y2-y1)^2 + (x2-x1)^2 ] = 4    or,     sqrt[ (y-1)^2 + (x-1)^2 ] = 4    or,    (y-1)^2 + (x-1)^2 = 16    As you can see, this is the equation of a circle around the point (1,1).    Similarly, they may ask you for the set of points equidistant from the points (2,2) and (3,-4).  In that case, use your distance formula, and set the equations equal to each other:    sqrt[ (y-2)^2 + (x-2)^2 ] = sqrt[ (y+4)^2 + (x-3)^2 ]    You can now solve away and find your answer...

5H7Wgaknaa	The magnitude difference between the two stars is 3.2. Using the formula to convert magnitude difference (M) to luminosity ratio (L), we have L = 2.512^M, which is 2.512^3.2 = 19.06. Star A is therefore 19.06 times as bright as star B, or if we take the luminosity of star B as 1 unit, the luminosity of star A is 19.06 units. The combined luminosity is therefore 20.06 units, i.e. 20.06 times the luminosity of star B. Using the same formula in reverse, we have M = 2.5log(L). So M = 2.5log(20.06) = 3.3. The combined magnitude of the two stars is therefore 3.3 magnitudes brighter than B, which is 5.1.
dQmFoRRiaa	11sqrt(26)|`|XxMhbMa3aa	Well the formula for finding the hypotenuse is a^2+b^2=c^2 a and b both being legs of the triangle and c being the hypotenuse. So here you were given a hypotenuse and a leg so you have to work back words to get the other leg. First, replace all variables: 11^2+b^2=15^2 then do what you can. 11 squared is 121 and 15 squared is 225 so, 121+b^2=225. Now you subtract to get the leg squared which is 225 -121= 104. so b^2=104. To take away the square you find the square root on both sides. b=10.19 but lets just say 10.  So now you have both legs which is what you need to find the area and the formula for the area of a triangle is a=lh/2 or length times height divided by two so 11 times 10 is 110, divided by two is 55. And there is your answer  Hope this helped and if you have any more questions feel free to contact me. :)|`|jG4ZFTC8aa	Use pythagorean theorem to find the missing leg...  a^2 + 11^2 = 15^2  a^2 + 121 = 225  a^2 = 104  a = sqrt 104    Area of triangle = .5(base * height)  =.5(11*sqrt104)  =.5(11*2sqrt26)  =.5(22sqrt26)  =11sqrt26 square units  OR about 56.09 square units (radical vs. decimal depending on your teacher!)|`|HhY4Oul2aa	haha i suck at geometery|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Ony two possible answers    (1) you are lazy  (2) you are laxy    and I will bet you will fail (miserably) in life,  start by practicing "Welcome to Wal Mart"|`|sS352szAaa	Area = 1/2 * base * height    a^2 + b^2 = c^2  11^2 + b^2 = 15^2  121 + b^2 = 225  b^2 = 104  b = sqrt(104)  b = 2 * sqrt(26)    Area = 1/2 * 2 * sqrt(26) * 11  Area = 11 * sqrt(26)  Area = ~56.089|`|voaMM1GQaa	120cm2|`|0RstDjygaa	do 15 x11 i think|`|9gEYdLKZaa	13.259 is the other leg, double the sides to make a square multiply then divide by 2|`|utbfT0APaa	Well, are you talking Feet or Inches or what?|`|O2QItYAaaa	15^2 = 11^2 + x^2   225 - 121 = x^2   sqrt(104) = x     (1/2)bh = (1/2)xy = (1/2)(sqrt(104))(11) = 56.089    To Veck: You made a calculator error. 11sqrt(26) is 56.089|`|S1qFQkTJaa	15*15=225  11*11=121  225-121=104  104 square rooted is 10.19    round it up to 10   10*11=110 cm squared    divide in half     answer is 55cm squared|`|elmXAPCDaa	About 56 square units.    a2+b2=c2  121+b2=225  b2=104  b is around 10  1/2 of b times 11 (height of triangle) is about 56    HOPE IT HELPS!|`|e7BBIMocaa	If Pythagoreums theorem states that a2 + b2 = c2, then 121 + b2 = 225 and b is about 10.19.

cJPrkRagaa	The first one is c.  Answer A does not work because ribosomes do not exist in ribosomes.  B does not work because DNA does not exit the nucleus.  And D does not work because rRNA is part of the structural makeup of the ribosome.  C works because the tRNA is the molecule which exits and enters a ribosome by binding to the codon on the mRNA with its anticodon.  It deposits its amino acid and leaves, making room for more tRNA.    The second one is B.  In order of the answer it COULD NOT BE.  A- ribosomes do not buddy up to translate mRNA.  C- Codons on the same mRNA transcript to not bind to each other, but to anticodons on tRNA.  D- the ribosome does not attach to mRNA, it simply serves the purpose of a "workbench" where the mRNA is fed through and tRNA molecules bind.  B is correct because after tRNA binds to its codon, its amino acid forms a peptide bond with its neighboring tRNA, then the tRNA exits the ribosome.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	C and B seem to be the best answers.

KJHw0oI3aa	To find the limiting reactant, start with the first reactant, and use dimensional analysis to find the minimum amount of the second reactant needed to react completely with the first.  Then compare the required quantity with the given quantity.  If the required quantity of the second reactant is less than the given quantity, then the second reactant is present in excess, and the first reactant is the limiting reactant.  If the required quantity of the second reactant is greater than the given quantity, then the second reactant is the limiting one.    Starting with Ca(OH)2:    [(15 g Ca(OH)2)/1][(1 mol Ca(OH)2)/74.094 g Ca(OH)2)][(2 mol HCl)/(1 mol Ca(OH)2)][(36.461 g HCl)/(1 mol HCl)] = 15 g HCl needed  Since 75 g of HCl is given, HCl is present in excess and Ca(OH)2 is the limiting reactant.    Next use dimensional analysis to find the mass of CaCl2 produced.  [(15 g Ca(OH)2)/1][(1 mol Ca(OH)2)/74.094 g Ca(OH)2)][(1 mol CaCl2)/(1 mol Ca(OH)2)][(110.986 g CuCl2)/(1 mol CuCl2)] = 22 g CuCl2 is formed.|`|4SJ0dAUEaa	I just did these like a month ago. you have to do it with the HCL and the Ca(OH)2 then the one one that comes out with less grams is the limiting reactant

After 4 diodes and 2 big caps, you will have 16 volts DC. Then use some 3 terminal regulators with heat sinks. Like LM7812 and LM7912.    If you don't want a lot of current, you can use 5 volt regulators from the same raw 16 volts, again, on a heat sink, or you use a different transformer, perhaps with about 8-0-8 volts secondary.     Download the data sheets for the 3 terminal regulators, and study them.    .

9Wi2eNInaa	I hate to say it, but in the engineering colleges, since they know they are in demand, they tend to follow the rule book very closely and are sometimes kind of snobbish about it    I started out and got a Associates degree in chemical technology and was working toward a bachelors. I tried taking everything at our community college since it was about half the price of the engineering college I wanted to finish up at    When I had three years worth of courses accumulated (the maximum I could take because the University required the last 32 semester hours on their campus, I transferred to the University.    With a high GPA they usually will accept you  (I had a 3.25 in the sciences and maths) but they killed me in what they would transfer. I assumed Organic Chemistry , Dufferential Equations, and Physics were all common to colleges. Not so.    They said I had to take their physics (10 semester hours) cause they said it was more calculus based than the series I took. They said the same thing about my Organic chemistry. One by one they tried to act like the courses I had taken weren't the equal of what they taught      I had to repeat a FULL year of organic, physics , biochemistry, a semester of differential equations and even a couple of history courses because the ones I took didn't satisfy their humanities.    You have no choice in the matter, if you don't repeat them they won't let you register for the courses you need to graduate. So I ended up taking 34 hours all over again of the same stuff I had in community college.    It was a total waste, by and large it was exactly the same material I had in community college with just a few different problems here and there.    I asked the guidance counselor how could I have avoided wasting all this time and money taking a year of courses for nothing    She said I should of taken my community colleges undergrad catalog and brought it to the admissions office and let an advisor make a course comparison between the two colleges. According to her, I would of known then what courses would be accepted at their University and I would of not wasted all that effort    But she did say she was very sorry.   Yeah....me too.    Anyway... I'm telling YOU !!! Don't listen to anyone here.     Take your school catalog and take it to the University you want to go to and ask them to tell you what courses you need to take at your school

cCFAUXaCaa	Ok...i'm italian I live in Italy anad i'm goind to help you :)..well  put in the place of the percentual grams.  Imagine having 100 grams of that compound: you know that 58.15 grams are barium , 13.74 grams.are sulfur and so on.  Now check the molecular mass of each element..  Now you have to divide the element that is in bigger quantities (in the place of numerator) with the element less present.  This way will let you know the moles.  In example you find that in the compound you have 0,423 mol of Ba  0,428 mol of S, and 1,757 mol of O.  Listen carefully this is the sistem you ALWAYS have to use in this kind of exercise.  Now divide the biggest number of moles with the smallest...  So,  you must do that in a way you will have integer numbers.. well   that number is the formula number you have to put in the formula.  So divide the oxigen mol with sulfur mol. you will find that the result i approximatively 4. this means 4 atoms of oxigen to 1 atom of sulfur and because of the similarity between the valor of sulfur moles and barium moles you can tell the relation ship is the same.  so the empirical formula is BaSO(4).  That's the big deal bro.(sorry for the americanism)|`|TpqWWZJNaa	The first thing you need to do is assume that each percent is the amount of grams in a 100g sample of this compound.  Then, you need to change each over to the amount of moles of that element.    58.15 g Ba x(1 mole/137.33) = .42343 moles Ba (you get the 137.33 from a periodic table)    13.74 g S x(1 mole/ 32.066) =   of moles of S    28.11 g O x(1mole/ 15.999) =   of moles of O    Now set up a mole ratio of Ba: S: O  To do this you will need to divide the value you got for each of the above moles by the smallest of them.  BTW, the Ba was the smallest when I crunched the numbers, so I divided each value by the amount of moles I got for Barium.    The ratio you get will be the amount of times each element shows up in the empirical formula.    The answer is most likely the formula for barium sulfate.

It is important in sustaining life because certain cells have a viable lifetime period in which they function well, but will deteriorate after this limit.

The Darwin's Finches diagram below illustrates the way the finch has adapted to take advantage of feeding in different ecological niche's.        Their beaks have evolved over time to be best suited to their function. For example, the finches who eat grubs have a thin extended beak to poke into holes in the ground and extract the grubs. Finches who eat buds and fruit would be less successful at doing this, while their claw like beaks can grind down their food and thus give them a selective advantage in circumstances where buds are the only real food source for finches.    Industrial Melanism  Polymorphism pertains to the existence of two distinctly different groups of a species that still belong to the same species. Alleles for these organisms over time are governed by the theory of natural selection, and over this time the genetic differences between groups in different environments soon become apparent, as in the case of industrial melanism.    Industrial melanism occurs in a species called the peppered moth, where the occurrence has become of more frequent occurrence since the beginning of the industrial age. The following argument elaborates the basis of principles involved in natural selection as far as industrial melanism is concerned.    Pollution, which is more common in today's world since the industrial age causes a change in environment, particularly in the 1800's when soot would collect on the sides of buildings from chimneys and industries and make them a darker colour.   The resultant effect was that the peppered moth, which had a light appearance was more visible against the darker backgrounds of sooty buildings.   This meant that predators of the peppered moth could find them more easily as they are more visible against a dark background.   Due to mutations, a new strain of peppered moth came to existence, where their phenotype was darker than that of the white peppered moth.   This meant that these new, darker peppered moths were once again harder to track down by their prey in environments where industry has taken its toll.   In this instance, natural selection would favour the darker moths in polluted environments and the whiter moths in the lesser polluted environments due to their ability to merge in with their environmental colours and lessen the chances of them being prone to a predator.   Sickle Cell Trait  Consider this argument of natural selection in the case of sickle cell trait, a genetic defect common in Africa.    Sickle cell trait is a situation that occurs in the presence of a recessive allele coding for haemoglobin, a substance in the blood responsible for the transport of gases like oxygen. The presence of the allele is either partially expressed recessively (sickle cell), or fully expressed by a complete recessive expression which results in full blown anaemia. If this particular allele is dominant, no sickle cell trait is expressed in the phenotype.   The above occurrences in the case of a recessive allele result in structural defects of red blood cells, severely reducing the organisms capacity to uptake oxygen.   It was pointed out that in Africa, there is a high frequency of this mutation, where cases of malaria were high.   A substantiated link was made noting those who suffer sickle cell trait or anaemia were immune to the effects of malaria.   This is yet again natural selection at work. Although sickle cell trait or anaemia are not advantageous characteristics on their own, they prove to be advantageous in areas where malaria proves to be a greater threat to preserving the genome (i.e. surviving).   The incomplete dominance of this genetic expression proves favourable either way.   This is how science has understood natural selection since the first studies involving Darwin. In the 21st century, humans selectively breed species to create hybrid species possessing the best genes of both parents via a process known as selective breeding.|`|XKhNw221aa	zebra stripes  opposable thumbs  bird's "hollow" bones  insect's exoskeleton  brightly colored frogs in rain forest that aren't poisonous   tall trees with deep roots|`|Jxq4TIavaa	Basically a cock roach would be? idunno they've survived for millions of years and thats what i think that would be "survival of the fittest"|`|547bced785891f1d9c99f6540d5752c6aa	The Detroit 3 auto companies failing when matched up to Japanese automakers?|`|AA11264399	Women in Africa with a natural immunity to HIV.

DhLIo8nbaa	Okay 400 mg of oxycontin is crazy, she should be dead.  OIf course shes abusing it if shes snorting it, she should be taking it as prescribed orally.  the reason she is falling asleep and is feeling all those feelings is because she is high.  Oxycontin is basically the same thing as heroin, and being addiced to oxys is just as bad as being addicted to heroin.  She needs to be very careful, because when she is getting nauseated she is starting to get dope sickm which is her body withdrawling from the opiates which is in the oxys.  She can go through massive withdrawel if she stops taking them, and its going to get to the point where she will need more and more so she doesnt get sick, and withdrawel from an opiate is horrible its very painful.  I ama  recovering heroin addict and I started on Oxys because my boyfeind got them from a pain clinic, and then moved up to heroin because it was cheaper, but they call oxycontin hillbilly heroin.  She needs to get herself some help.  I have been clean for awhile now, and now I am an addictions counselor in a rehab so I watch people go through withdrawels everyday.  you need to let someone know whaat she is doing to herself because if she keeps this up she can kill herself, it sounds like her addiction is already out of control if shes snorting that much at one time, and eventually snorting it gets old and most people start doing it intreveniously.  So please try and help her, even though she probably wont want it and if she doesnt then you need to cut ties with her for awhile because she is dangerous right ow, and the more loved ones she loses to this disease then it might make her wake up and realize what shes doing to herself.  She needs to be watched and given the amount she should be taking for the pain she has, because I do understand shes in real pain but she is taking advantage of that.|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	Your friend will eventually OD and her respiratory system will shut down and she will go into rspiratory failure. Passing out is getting close to that.  The other factor here is the acetomenifen in the OxyContin. 500mg x 40 = 20000 mg-- plenty to kill her liver and kidneys in short order. Not good.  Do all you can to persuade her to go to rehab. She is taking 40 times the recommended dose for severe pain.

8m9HXnPfaa	Ionic compounds consist of a Metal and a Non-Metal. Bromine (Br) is a non-metal. Therefore, you would need to combine it with a metal. Calcium is a metal but phosphorus and chlorine are non-metals and caarobn is a metalloid.    Answer: Calcium, which would create CaBr2    As I said, an ionic compound consist of both a metal and non-metal. Ba (barium) is a metal and I (Iodide) is a non metal. C (carbon) is a metalloid while S (sulfur), P (phosphorus), Cl (chlorine), N (nitrogen) and O (oxygen) are all non-metals.    Answer: BaI2, which is barium iodide.    I hope I helped.

You will have to come up with some explanation for why none of your seeds grew, and start the experiment again.      Presumably, you had a "control" which means some seeds that did not get the sulfuric acid solution, but just water.  If these "untreated" seeds didn't grow, then your experiment suggests that either the germination time is greater than a week (in which case you can wait longer), or the seeds are bad (in which case you must start from scratch with a different batch of seeds.)|`|xHcQSLiVaa	You have measured seed growth.

QoVE2erFaa	To show something is a Linear Transformation you have to show it has two properties:  1. T ( kp) = k *T(p)   and 2. T(p) + T(q) = T(p+q)    A typical vector in this space has the form:  p = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3  Thus p' = b + 2cx + 3dx^2, and p'' = 2c + 6dx  So:  T(p) = 2p''-p'+2p = [4c-b+2a] + [12d-2c+2b]x + [-3d+2c]x^2 + 2dx^3  (after combining terms and simplifying)    Now  kp = ka+kbx+kcx^2+kdx^3  so:  (kp)' = kb+2kcx+3kdx^2     and  (kp)'' = 2kc+6kdx  Now calculate T( kp ) =   [k4c-kb+k2a] + [k12d-k2c+k2b]x + [-k3d+k2c]x^2 + k2dx^3  (after combining and simplifying)    Now compare T( p )  with T( kp ) and you see that k*T(p) does   equal T(kp). So the first requirement is met.    2. Now we take a second element in the space:   q = m + nx + rx^2 + sx^3.  Again calculate T(q) as above {you need to get q' and q'' of course} and then add T(q) + T(p)  Then add  p+q = (a+m) + (b+n)x + (c+r)x^2 + (d+s)x^3 and calculate  (p+q)'  and  (p+q)''  Then find  T(p+q) = 2(p+q)'' - (p+q)' +2(p+q)  Then compare and see if  T(p)+T(q) equals T(p+q)    You will find it does {I leave writing out the details to you}.    Therefore, this is a linear transformation.    You would guess this answer since differentiation itself is a linear transformation  { because  d( k*f(x) )/dx = k* d(f(x))/dx and   d(f+g)/dx = df/dx + dg/dx } and the transformation in this problem is simply a linear combination of those.    Let me know if you need more details.

He2WsvBcaa	dihydrogen monoxide.  When you're naming compounds containing both nonmetal elements, the name of the compound will end in -ide. Because these two elements often can form more than one compound, a prefix is used to tell how many atoms of each element are present. CO is named carbon monoxide, while CO2 is named carbon dioxide. If only one atom of the first element is present, the prefix mono- will not be used. For example, NO is named nitrogen monoxide, while N2O4 is dinitrogen tetroxide.  These are the prefixes:    Number of atoms----prefix    1--------------------------mono-  2--------------------------di-  3--------------------------tri-  4--------------------------tetra-  5--------------------------penta-  6--------------------------hexa-  7--------------------------hepta-  8--------------------------octo-|`|3YyrY1Yraa	2 parts hydrogen to 1 part oxygen|`|L8oyada9aa	dihydrogen monoxide|`|Ady9PpWeaa	dihydrogen oxide|`|oRdw13XEaa	h20 or sodiom fluride

No one on earth, magic, or alien, can tell you when the world will end no one can see the future and predict it. Logicaly and Scientifically it is impossible to predict or see the future when it will end. Unless you can obisously see it ( aka Astroid ) with your own eyes it wont happen. Religious in my religion( Im Christian ) God can decide and change the date when the world will end. If I were god wich im not I would be piss that people found out that I planned the world will end in 2012, and to show of i would change the date sooner or later. Think about many people thought that the world will end in 2000 and 2006 and 2007 and 2008 with many stupid ideas. Did it happen? No.... are we still alive? Yes! so trust me it wont happen unless scietist can prove it not rely on hocus pocus mayas and other whackjobs. Ty for your time and reading sorry for it being to long.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

MGDV8Q8vaa	Assuming that the temperature of the water is constant, yes, this is a Boyle's Law problem. It doesn't matter that the balloon is underwater as long as T is constant.    P1V1 = P2V2    P1 = initial pressure = 1.0 atm  V1 = initial volume = 7.5 L  P2 = new pressure = ?  V2 = new volume = 2.5 L    P2 = P1V1 / V2 = (1.0)(7.5) / (2.5) = 3.0 atm    When T and n (moles of gas) are constant, P and V are inverses; if P doubles, then V is cut in half. If V triples, P is cut to 1/3 of what it was. In this problem, V is reduced to 1/3 of what it was, so P has to triple. You're reducing the volume of a balloon to 1/3 of what it was initially and still keeping the amount of gas in the balloon constant. Now the gas molecules have 1/3 less space to bounce around in so they collide with the container walls 3 times as often as before. Collision with the container walls is what causes pressure.|`|PaiBMV6Gaa	3.0 atm|`|He2WsvBcaa	3.0 atm  The volume of a gas and the pressure are inversely proportional, meaning that if the pressure increases, then the volume must decrease.  The volume of the gas in the balloon is 7.5 L at 1.0 atm  Once the balloon has been taken underwater to a depth where the new volume is 2.5L, then you know that if the volume decreased, its pressure must have increased.  The volume of 7.5L was cut to one third of what it originally was, giving you 2.5L which was the final volume, so you will need to multiply the pressure by 3 and your final pressure will be 3.0 atm  Note: atm is how pressure is measured. Others can be measured in torr, millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), and kilopascals.

AA10927246	According to Wikipedia, a U.S. penny weighs 2.5 grams.  That's assuming you are talking about the newer pennies which are essentially copper-plated zinc (97.6% zinc and only 2.4% copper).  If you are talking about the older copper-zinc version (95% copper, 5% zinc) prior to 1982, that would be 3.11 grams per penny.  I'll assume they are all the newer version.    First figure the number of pennies:  $1,000,000 x 100 pennies/dollar = 100 million pennies    Multiply by 2.5 grams per penny:  2.5 x 100 million  = 250 million grams  = 250,000 kilograms    Using the conversion factor for kilograms to lbs (2.20462262 kg/lb), that's about 551,156 lbs    Dividing by 2000 lbs / ton:  Or about 275.6 tons    Answer:   275.6 tons    Note:  The department of transportation sets a limit of about 40 tons of carrying capacity for an 18-wheeler, so you are going to need at least 7 trucks, probably more if you don't want to overload them.

Each ball has a momentum of  .45*3.3 = 1.485 kgm/s.  The total momentum of the system (assuming the balls are travelling to the right on the x-axis and up on the y-axis) is the vector sum so  M = sqrt(1.485^2 + 1.485^2) = 2.1 kgm/s at an angle of /4 rad.    They will only collide if, at all times before they reach the origin, they are the same distance from the origin.    Doug

TpqWWZJNaa	These can all be solved by using the conversion factor method.  I'll try to walk you through them without doing them for you.    In problem 13, you are going from grams to moles to molecules (I'm assuming that's the same thing as formula units).  But before you do that, you need to find the molar mass of sugar (12 x 12.011) + (22 x 1.0079) + (11x15.999) = the amount of grams per mole of sugar.  Each of those numbers came from the periodic table of elements.  The 12, 22, and 11 came from what you wrote of the formula for sugar.    g x (mole / g) = moles of sugar   Here you would be dividing by that number you just calculated, the molar mass of sugar. So 62/ number you calculated should give you moles of sugar    mol of sugar x (6.02 x 10^23 molecules/ 1 mol) =   of molecules of sugar you have    You can solve any one of your problems using that information.  You just have to realize that if the number is on top of the conversion factor (like 6.02 x 10^23 is in the second step), you will multiply... and if it is in the bottom (like the molar mass is in the first step) you will divide.    Always put what you want to get rid of on the bottom and what you want to move to in the top... In a conversion factor, you are converting from one thing into another.  "From" goes on the bottom, "to" goes on the top.    g x (mole/ molar mass in g)    mole x (molar mass in g/ mole)    mole x (6.02 x 10^23 molecule/ mole)    molecule x (mole/ 6.02 x 10^23)    There is no conversion from grams to molecules.... you MUST go through moles in a two step conversion to get your answer.|`|gPVon8Wiaa	I just finished this chapter a couple weeks ago.    You need to use conversion factors that will cancel each other out.    For number 13, you need to find the molar mass of the compound. First put down the given.  Now once you have found the molar mass  use the correct labelling and  put whatever number of grams under one mole.  The grams cancelled out.  So now to cancel out the moles put Avogadro's number above one mole.  The work should look like this:    62.0 g/1  X  1 mole/ 342.24g  X 6.02 x10^23/1mole    (/ = divided by)    Now multiply and divide it out.  Make sure you have 3 sig figs too.      You can use these conversion factors to work out the rest of the problems too. Let me know if you need help on any of the other ones.

Get a device to rotate the gun in a circle while it always faces the same direction. Attach a string to the bullet that is also attached inside the gun. The bullet will then break tension and will actually be able to curve. However, doing all these things are unrealistic and the bullet would not even kill anyone due to the enrgy it would take to break tension.|`|f7Rk1sbmaa	lol when I first saw this question I thought of the movie Wanted.    But the answer is NO, NO , NO    Unless there is centripetal force acting on it, the bullet will not curve. Guns work by throwing bullets in straight lines, so it is not possible to give the bullet centripetal force.

R1NHUuyzaa	Stars are far more dense in their cores than on their surface.|`|KHjYq2bHaa	Stars like the sun is an equilibrium. There is an outward pressure from thermonuclear reactions within the sun, which balances the gravitational force. This is called hydrostatic equilibrium.|`|f18e617fe0754473c97b4f67d099bfcdaa	Gravity always tries to collapse the Sun, but that also creates pressure and thus intense heat in it's core. So much heat and pressure in fact, nuclear fusion to the tune of 654 million tons of hydrogen each second into 650 million tons of helium occurs there. The 4 million ton difference disappears as intense heat and gamma rays, which further heat up the Sun's interior and counterbalance the inward pull of gravity upon the Sun's matter. The gravity of the Sun keeps it's core hot and dense enough for nuclear fusion to occur, and nuclear fusion provides enough pressure to keep the Sun in a stable state where it's neither expanding, nor contracting. The Sun, and all other stars fusing hydrogen for energy is very much like a soap bubble held in perfect equilibrium as long as the hydrogen fuel supply lasts. Only when all sources of energy are exhausted will the Sun collapse in on itself until mutual repulsion between electrons stops the collapse from going any farther, leaving the Sun about twice the diameter of Earth but with a density approaching 10 tons to the cubic inch or more. Once in that state, it will be a white dwarf, which are only supported by electrons being packed together and not nuclear fusion in the interior. For massive stars, when all sources of energy are exhausted, the core will implode into a neutron star or black hole, while the rest of the star explodes as a supernova, which is entirely driven by a massive stars immense gravitational field.|`|jSPj3S6faa	Actually, the sun, like all stars, primarily is powered by the pull of gravity.  This is what powers the fusion process at the core.  However, the fusion process produces an outward force which at this time for our sun just nearly balances the pull of gravity to the output of energy.  The sun is collapsing in on itself but it is doing it very slowly and it will not become a problem for another five billion years when all the hydrogen has been fused into helium, then there will be a little show (as in "a big show").

8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	I think you're right. Time is the product of existence of space, energy and matter. Without them, there is no time and hence no cause. For exactly this reason, I believe that there was no cause of the Big Bang.    Time stretches back only to the point of the Big Bang, but no further. Actually, instead of representing time as a line, think of it as a series of concentric circles. Each circe is the cause of the circle outside it and the effect of the circle inside it. Moving outwards from circle to circle is moving forward in time; moving inwards from circle to circle is moving back in time. Now, think of what you see as you move inwards. The circles become smaller and smaller, until they come to a point in the centre. This point is infinitely small. You can't go inwards anymore. This is the ultimate cause of the Universe - the Big Bang.|`|ICpgOCQaaa	Yes, because without the passage of time 2 events are coinciding, and so how can one cause the other?|`|A3RU9L1Raa	think causality requires a direction of time..ie towards states with the potential for achieving greater numbers of possible arrangements|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	I guess if you think about it, not much of anything is going to take place without time.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	Causality does require that if A 'causes' B then A must happen 'before' B as seen by any observer in any reference frame.

In theory, if you take the motor out of a home appliance like a washing machine or microwave oven's turntable, and then forceably spin the rotating part around - it should generate electricity out of the "incoming" wires.

PlBHhU3Kaa	"Truly, spiders do seem rather buggish; they're creepy, have loads of legs and the thick outer structure (an exoskeleton) that other bugs possess. In short, if it looks like it, feels like it, tastes like it (?!), well, it must be...    That rule doesn't apply here. When you look more closely at a spider, one thing becomes immediately clear: it only has two segments, the most important of which is called the prosoma. The prosoma in spiders is the smaller segment and bears both the spider's head and all of the spider's walking legs, while the larger part, the abdomen, bears another part spiders are famous for, silk-secreting spinnerets (we'll discuss silk production in a later post).    The major distinction between spiders and insects is in the mouth. While insects have evolved leaf and flesh shredding mandibles from small appendages on the head evolved from a common ancestor of both spiders and insects, spiders have more primitive feeding parts called chelicerae tipped with well-known and well-feared fangs with which spiders subdue and tear prey into digestible pieces. Chelicerae can be used like knives or scissors depending on the species of spider.    For this reason more than any other, spiders are placed as a class under the subphylum Chelicerata (Greek: claw) and insects are placed into the subphylum Mandibulata*, (Greek: jaw)."|`|4A6kUcB3aa	They are arthropods.

62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	Ok I made you a powerpoint presentation and emailed it to you.     The timeline is quite long so I couldnt add any pictures to this PPT. .  If you want pictures, that will add at least one extra slide, and maybe more. so please email me back, tel me what you want, and I will be happy to help.     I sent you two emails because I forgot to attach the PPT to the first email - silly me.     Hope it was what you wanted.    To those of you who are laughing at this student - he says he doesnt have access to powerpoint.   DID YOU know how to use powerpoint or have access to it from home, when you were in high school?   well did you?   NO?   I didnt think so.    And NO it did not take me several hours.   Anyone who takes hours to make a PPT is very slow and very dumb.   I took only 30 minutes.   I was happy to help.

ztd2mEvaaa	it all has to do with the strength of the bonds holding the atoms together    the C-H bond has a pretty low dissociation energy (meaning that it dosent require a lot of energy to break that bond) and in methan its 4 C-H bonds    H2O has 2 elements that have large differences in electronegativity. also, the O-H bond in one water molecule is polar. ploar bonds are strong. so it takes a lot of energy to break them      simply put, the large difference in boiling point can be attributed to the fact that the bonds of a water molecule are stronger than the bonds of a methane molecule
Gem96NQyaa	The effect occurs when something very cold, such as ice cream, touches the top palate in the mouth. The blood vessels constrict due to the cold. This makes the nerves send a signal to the brain to open blood vessels. But this rapid opening of the blood vessels makes fluid back up in the tissues that won't drain for thirty seconds to a minute. This causes a slight swelling in the forehead that causes pain.|`|9bWLzwHjaa	I am pretty sure that brain freezes are caused by putting something cold like ice cream on the roof of your mouth|`|k5Ece8BTaa	Let's say you are eating ice cream. If you eat your ice too fast, that can cause a brain freeze. Inorder to stop a brain freeze, did you know that you can put your tongue at the roof of your mouth and keep there for about a minute? It will help stop the brain freeze quicker.

Definately not White Hyacinth Bean.    The other answer suggested Brandegea as a possibility. I don't think this is likely, as the fruit of Brandegea should have a long "beak", and it doesn't grow near Simi Valley.    Marah macrocarpus does grow in your area, and the characters I can see in your photos are consistent with that species.    Very nice photos, BTW.  Much better than most of the people asking plant ID questions.  Separate photos of the fruit and flower are very helpful.  One suggestion though; put a ruler in the picture so we can see how big things are.
MGDV8Q8vaa	A subscript in a formula tells you how many of each atom there are in a compound.    Fe3O4: there are 3 Fe and 4 O in this compound. If there is no number, it's 1). If you change these numbers, you have a DIFFERENT compound (example: Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 are NOT the same!!!). So when you balance an equation, YOU CANNOT CHANGE THESE SUBSCRIPTS. The number in front of a formula is the coefficient, and means to multiply everything in the formula by that number. THE COEFFICIENT is the only thing you can change when balancing an equation. So 4H2O means that there are 8H and 4 O.    H2O means that there are 2 H for every 1 O. Compare that to hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, where there are 2H and 2 O.

ivH8tRtsaa	Very little if any. Most of the chemicals, agents, and processes involved can be easily handled by reading the directions on the bottle or box in which they came. Now if you are talking about at the manufacturer's level, there are several types of chemistry involved. You can call it physical, organic or whatever, but chemistry is chemistry no matter what name you give it. Its like physics. It is what it is. Chemistry is dealing with elements at the molecular or even atomic level. Its about how elements combine, react, or mix and the results accomplished by these processes. Once you develop a good understanding of the laws and theories of chemistry, they hold true no matter what branch of chemistry you apply them to. I don't know if this answers your question, but hey, I tried. Have a wonderful day.|`|7htMu63haa	Well for the first guy at least we know your not gay.<br>  But cosmetology is more then just hair even i know that<br>  and I am not gay.Your question should say what type of science does cometology involve?<br>  So to answer your question about i would have to say<br>  medical, biology, and organic.<br>  If you need more help on how to classify these please feel free to email me.|`|NlaVawVhaa	LOL? It also involves chemistry. What do you get your hair colored, permed, straighted, with? Chemicals. There is no organic chemistry involved(no carbon).

KJHw0oI3aa	Did you notice that this usually happens in winter time when the weather outside is cold and the air both inside and out is very dry?    The reason that you get "shocked" is because while you are walking (probably mostly on carpets), you rub your feet against the floor.  When that happens, some of the atoms on your shoes and those on the floor rub against each other with the result that some of the electrons on some atoms get transferred to other atoms with the result that both you and the floor get electrically charged, one positively, and the other negatively.  When you touch a metal object, that lets electrons flow through it easily, the tendency is to equalize the charge by having extra electrons flow either from you to the metal, or from the metal to you depending on what charge you are carrying.  The result is a tiny spark and the feeling of being "shocked".

KHjYq2bHaa	Well it is pretty hard to graph here! Just a few simply tips; if there is a >= or     If it is just plain > or     The first thing you do is plot the graphs as normal as if there was an equals sign there.    1. x = 2 is just vertical line if drawn to an (x,y) coordinate system. You just shade in all the values of x, which are greater than 2.    2. y=x is a straight line passing through (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), etc... You shade in the side of the line where y is strictly less than x. In this case it would be below the line    3. Again just plot the line. A bit more complicated though.    For the word problem, you just have to define variables. Let L be the longest side and D be the distance around.    I don't understand the problem completely but it will be of the form:  L + D

You should now have:    y = -3x + 4    To graph this, start with the point (0,4) on your graph because that is you y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis) then follow the slope of -3 (rise/run so it would be down 3, right 1) to find the other points on the line.    2y = x - 6    Again, you must isolate the y. To do it, divide both sides by 2. Since right now your slope is 1, it will be 1/2. Now you should have:    y = 1/2x - 3    To graph this, do the same thing that you did in your last graph. Start with point (0,-6) and use your slope of 1/2 (up 1, right 2)    Hope I was helpful!|`|0qNuPw5taa	you change the first equation to y = -3x + 4  the second one is 2y = x -6 then you multiply 2 on both side to get rid of the 2 so then its y = 1/2x - 3.     then you graph 4 on the y- axis and you go down 3 and over to the right 1    the next equation you graph -3 on the y axis and go up 1 and to the right 2|`|ZPGFY99Laa	well depends what method, but u can do substituion, get 2y=x-6 into Slope-Intercept, then substitute the answer of that y=(1/2x)-3 and sub the (1/2x)-3 part into y for the other equation-----You can do the rest right? =P|`|KtLxBXDdaa	2y=x-6  the other equation can be converted into:  6x+2y=4  2y= -6x+4    subtract the second equation form the first to get----    0= 7x + 2  so x= -2/7    then substitute to get y|`|Hplw489Eaa	First change it into slope- intercept form. y=-3x+4 and y= 1/2x - 3  then put the y intercept on the graph i.e. 4 and -3  then use the slope to graph the rest. the first slope is -3x the other one is 1/2x  slope is rise over run so -3x is -3/1 which means it goes down 3 (because its negative) and goes over 1.|`|Ei5m7K9naa	First, you should get them into y=mx+b form. So: 3x+y=4 (subtract 3x from each side) --> y= -3x+4.  And for the other, 2y=x-6 (divide each side by two) --> y= (1/2)x - 3.  The y intercept for each is the constant (last number without a variable), and the slope is the coefficeint of x. So for the first equation, the Y intercept is (0,4), and the slope is minus 3.  Make a point at (0,4) and go left one, up three, then draw another point (at (-1,7)). Connect these points for your first line. For the second equation, the Y Intercept is (0,-3) and the slope is 1/2.  Draw a point at (0,-3) and go up one, right two and draw another point. Connect these two points for the second line.|`|ZINg8c6Kaa	Choose any number for x, say x=1.  Plug in 1 for x in the first equation:  3(1)+y=4, or 3+y=4.  Then solve for y: y=4-3=1.  The point (1,1) is on the graph of the first equation.  Repeat this process for another number for x, say x=2.  After you substitute and solve for y, you get y=-2, so (2,-2) is another point on the graph of the first equation.  Plot these two points, and draw a line through them.  Repeat this process for the second equation.  Let x=2 in the second equation, substitute and solve for y, getting y=-2.  Plot the point (2,-2).  If you let x=6, you get y=0, so plot the point (6,0).  Then draw the line through these two points.  The solution to the system of equations is where the two lines cross.  You have to draw the lines carefully to get an accurate point of intersection.
4J8X1aKkaa	It's basically a trick question.  The theory of most geographers is that everything either happens on the earth's surface or affects it in one way or another.  You might be able to find something in distant astronomy, but there's still a relationship between the earth and what happens space.    Anything religious or God related can be shot down regardless of belief as most religions explain the origin of earth.    Even math is related to geography. Without it we don't have a sophisticated built environment or accurate mapping systems. We don't have a means to do quantative analysis, demographics, population counts, densities.

bRfLyvPIaa	The electron transport chain of respiration and the light reactions of photosynthesis both happen in the inner membrane systems of the mitochondria and chloroplast, respectively. The membranes are required to establish a gradient of protons (from one side to the other). This gradient then provides the power to phosphorylate ADP (see the link below for a better description). The point being that without an intact membrane, the proton gradient couldn't be maintained.    As to how the electrons are generated in photosynthesis, I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but when light strikes the chlorophyll molecule the photons transfer their energy to an electron which basically knocks it out of the molecule. There are two photosystems and the electrons from photosystem I goes to reduce NAD+, those from PSII go to replace those lost by PSI and the ones that were lost by PSII are replaced by electrons from water, which then releases protons and oxygen. So I guess you could say they were generated from water, if you want to put it that way. See the second source below for a slide show of the whole process.

tsaPnLzDaa	Enzyme denature when temperatures are perfect  That means they either mutate, and work differently  or just completely dont work anymore.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	III. Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Activity    Enzymes are designed to function within a specific temperature range. You might make some guesses as to the outcome for the following temperatures below. Keep in mind that the structures that produce the enzyme are fruit and potato; on the Celsius temperature scale 0 degrees is freezing, 22 degrees is room temperature, and 100 degrees is boiling. The hotter it is, the more rapidly molecules are vibrating and moving about. Collisions of water molecules with the enzyme could undo its folded structure that is held in position by hydrogen bonds; when this happens the molecule is said to have been denatured. What would happen to the active site in this case? At low temperatures molecules move very slowly, and the chance of their colliding and reacting with one another is very low. Note that the potato extract has been kept on ice. Why?    Write down your hypothesis about the effect of temperature on enzyme activity:         Set up 6 pairs of test tubes with 10 drops of potato extract in one set and 10 drops of 1% catechol in the other. Incubate them for 5 minutes, one pair in each of the 5 temperature environments indicated below. Then mix the potato extract and catechol together; record the initial color, and put that tube back in the controlled temperature environments. Record the color again after 5 minutes.

If the slower plane traveled x miles per hour, then the faster plane travels x + 140 miles per hour.      After one hour, the slow plane is thus x miles away from the airport, while the faster plane is x + 140 mile away from the airport.    Then we have a right triangle with hypotenuse 260 and legs x and x + 140.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem:    x^2 + (x + 140)^2 = 260^2    Simplifying    x^2 + (x^2 + 280x + 19600 ) = 67600, or  2x^2 + 280x = 48000, or dividing by 2,  x^2 + 140x = 24000, or  x^2 + 140x - 24000 = 0    You can solve the last equation any way you choose.  I factored it:    (x - 100)(x + 240) = 0  so x = 100 or x = -240    We disregard the x = -240 solution since a plane can't travel a negative number of miles per hour.    Thus the slow plane flies at 100mph (x = 100) and the fast plane flies at 240mph (x + 140 = 240).|`|fvwLFWqwaa	divide them by eachother|`|3d1XRIzkaa	260-140=120  260-120=140  140 divided by 120 is 1 1/7 miles per hour|`|gxwF60jMaa	Let r = rate of one plane  r + 140 = rate of other plane  1(r) = r = distance traveled by one plane  2(r + 140) = r + 140distance traveled by other plane  By pythagorean theorem  (r)2 + (r + 140)2 = (260)2  r2 + r2 + 280r + 19600 = 67600  2r + 280r  48000 = 0  r + 140r  24000 = 0  (r + 240)(r  100) = 0  (r + 240) = 0  r = 240 discard, negative rate  (r  100) = 0  r = 100 mph ...............rate of one plane  100 + 140 = 240 mph.. rate of other plane|`|Q0jUU7A5aa	HINT: Draw a diagram if you're stuck.    Note: Not to scale.    faster plane  /|\  .|..\  .|....\  .|......\  .|-----> slower plane    As you can see, it's making a right angle, so you can use the Pythagorean theorem.    But first, we need to find out how far each plane has gone.    HINT: Write what you know in a table.    .............................. Distance ............. Rate ............. Time  faster plane .......... d ......................... x + 140 ......... 1  slower plane ......... d ......................... x ................... 1    Remember that d = r * t.  Apply this to your table.    .............................. Distance .............. Rate ............. Time  faster plane .......... d = (x + 140) * 1 .. x + 140 ......... 1  slower plane ......... d = x * 1................ x ................... 1    .............................. Distance .............. Rate ............. Time  faster plane .......... d = x + 140 ........... x + 140 ......... 1  slower plane ......... d = x...................... x ................... 1    Remember what you know about the Pythagorean Theorem.  a2 + b2 = c2    This means:  (side a)2 + (side b)2 = (hypotenuse)2    Given: they are 260 miles apart  Means: hypotenuse = 260    Applied to what you have, the formula becomes:  (faster plane's distance)2 + (slower plane's distance)2 = (distance apart)2    Plug in what you know.  (x + 140)2 + (x)2 = (260)2    Expand.  (x)2 + 2(x)(140) + (140)2 + x2 = 67600  x2 + 280x + 19600 + x2 = 67600  2x2 + 280x + 19600 = 67600    Subtract 67600 from both sides.  2x2 + 280x + 19600 - 67600 = 67600 - 67600  2x2 + 280x - 48000 = 0    Factor.  (2x + 480)(x - 100) = 0    Set each factor to 0 and solve for x.  2x + 480 = 0  2x = -480  2x / 2 = -480 / 2  x = -240    Since rates can't be negative, we throw this out.    x - 100 = 0  x = 100    Update your table.    ..............................

MGDV8Q8vaa	The old system was used for metals that had two main oxidation states. The lower oxidation state took the -ous suffix while the higher one took the -ic prefix.    Antimony has two main oxidation states, +3 and +5. Sb2O3 has Sb+3 (the lower state) so it's called antimonous oxide. Sb2O5 (with Sb+5) is called antimonic oxide.    In the old system, the chemist had to memorize what those two oxidation states are for each metal. All we know is that an -ous ion has a lower oxidation number than its   -ic counterpart.    The new (stock) system gives the charge of the ion in parentheses: Sb(III) and Sb(V).    Another example: Sn2+ and Sn4+  The former is called "stannous" and the latter is "stannic." Nowadays it's Fe(II) and Fe(III).

qq5nceCXaa	What you're talking about is Lamarckian evolution.    When you weight train you aren't creating a mutation in the DNA in you're germ line cells, the DNA you will pass on to your offspring.  You're not evolving, you already possess the ability to grow muscle, your body is just reacting to use.  It's a little like expecting your offspring to only have one leg if you lose yours, or to be born without an appendix if you have yours removed.    Now if you have a variation of alleles within the genome that means that you respond well to weight training and easily grow muscles, and possessing these muscles makes you better at reproducing, be that attracting a fertile mate, more mates, or better able to provide, then those genes for improved muscle growth would be preserved and passed on.  If that was true across all society, all muscle bound hunks were better at having offspring that the geeks and nerds then over time the trait would become dominant.    In our society this doesn't seem to be the case as women select for long term child rearing ability in general.  Though for one night stands they seem to have a preference for the muscle's, possibly a hang over form the cheat strategy, but this is unlikely to be preserved as poor fathers don't make for a good evolutionary stable solution ESS.|`|Wz9tSKTaaa	Simply because all you pass onto your child are your genes (in your sperm), and nothing about the process of exercising your muscles affects your genetic code or the way your sperm are produced at all.     The only way improvements are created is through (initially) random mutations in a living thing's DNA. If this codes for something helpful (it usually doesn't but occasionally does) that will provide a survival or reproductive advantage. That will simply mean that they are likely to be more of your descendents because of that useful gene change through natural selection.    What you describe sounds more like Lamarkism - which Darwin initially believed in.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarck    I think it's been shown that you can/do change your DNA during your lifetime in the sense of damaging it with toxins etc. Unfortunately nothing as directed or useful as rippling pecs is likely to be passed on from one generation to the next.|`|RTY5VahLaa	The idea you are talking about was originally proposed by Jean Baptiste Lamarck, a more or less contemporary of Darwin.  Lamarck believed that all cells of the mother contribute something to the offspring.  In this way, he postulated that long-necked baby giraffes would be the result if the mother had to stretch her neck to get higher tree leaves.  This idea has been pretty much completely discredited.  The only cells that contribute to the offspring are the sperm and the ova.  So lift all you want, it's good for you.  But it won't make any difference to your offspring.|`|AA11606721	"To survive an animal evolves to require "desirable traits" depending on where it lives.

It survives well or not depending on the combination of where it lives and the traits it acquired from it's parents. You can only pass along the traits you were born with.|`|F6IOLf3Aaa	The evolution of phenotype traits and how they get past on to the next generation is a pretty abstract concept to try and wrap ones mind around.    One comes into this world with the genome and traits that their parents, grandparents, and to a lesser degree distant relatives contributed. You survive because you are adapt to the immediate environment.  Now, you cannot pass on to your children characteristics and traits you develop today because these are somatic effects -- not in the germ-line (the gametes).  What you may pass on to your children is your genetic "tendencies" and "potential" for building large muscles if they employed weight training.  However, the traits themselves are never passed on to the next generation directly.  So, what that seems to suggest is, what you express and develop in yourself is a "hint" at what you children "may" be able to achieve as well.    Keep in mind that evolution starts with gene mixing and sometimes mutations in the gametes, sex cells.  What happens in the already existing somatic cells of the body doesn't affect evolution one way or another.  It's all about "potential" in the genes of the gametes.    I think what makes the science of evolution so hard for most people to understand and believe is: so many of our individual characteristics are handed down through family members. Yet, some are direct functions of gene mutations.  It is not easy for the individual to differentiate between an inherented trait and one that has been modified somewhat by random mutation.  Then, many triats change so slowly over a number of generations, then abruptly in others.  It's just all a game of change, pretty much.|`|gGdXav6Laa	It is because evolution isn't real.|`|72VoC7LVaa	sorry this wont ever happen. its like is your arm was amputated. the wound would eventually heal, but your kids wont be born without an arm. also if you bleach your hair, your offspring wont be blond unless its in your genes. this is an aquired trait, it is not determined by genes.|`|LvnEbqxAaa	um.. If you work out to gain muscle, you cannot pass that trait onto your children. It's not a gene necessarily, but has to do more with environmental factors. Only traits on the genome can be passed on. For example, if you tan, the darker skin color is not passed on to your offspring because that was a change in your phenotype due to environmental factors. Or, if you dye your hair, that trait is not passed on either.

The physical and biochemical evidence is simply overwhelming. What strikes me is -- evolution is a basic characteristic of nature. Even the universe itself evolves and continues to evolve. And why not.  The patterns of evolution is everywere, even in the basic components of matter and structure, the subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules.  Evolution goes on inside the atom in its most basic rudimentary form. Subatomic particles are routinely appearing out of the vacuum, annihilating with their antimatter particles, releasing energy and "new" particle types.  For example: there are neutrons and protons in the nucles of an atom.  The protons are stable but the neutron, if isolated from protons in the nucleus, the neutron will become unstable and in about 10 minutes it will change into a proton -- "change into"  is the basic idea and pattern of evolution.  In alpha an beta radiation, given enough time radio active elements will decay into a ligther element -- "change into" pattern.    So, why is it surprising that larger more complex arrangements of atoms and molecules also "change into" something different given the right set of conditions.  If one considers biological evolution from an atomic perspective (quantum mechanics), biological evolution starts to make a whole lot more sense.

eUgwHzeqaa	It has always been my understanding that they don't do this in a way that kills the donor animal.  You can donate a kidney and still have sufficient function for a normal life (that is why there are also living human kidney donors).  I am not actually aware of any cases of animal liver transplants (which is not to say that there aren't any), but it is also possible to transplant part of a liver, not the entire organ.  Again, this has been done in humans as well (without killing the donor).  There are, of course, risks to any kind of surgery, and occasionally people do die after donating.  I'm sure some animals do, or will, as well, but it isn't intentional.    It is my understanding that the owners of the original animal are required to adopt and care for the donor animal as part of the deal.  I don't think that they do cadaveric transplants (probably because there are not a whole lot of animals who are on life support machines, which is pretty much necessary if you're trying to harvest organs after brain death or cardiac death).      So, while you raise an interesting question, I don't think that anyone in the veterinary community is doing this, any more than anyone in the human medical community would countenance killing a person to obtain an organ that would save another person.    Medical ethics questions are always interesting, regardless of what patient population we're talking about.|`|nM2vNMJkaa	Right, before I start, I'm going to state that this is MY opinion and reflects the thoughts of no one but myself.

I feel that if an animal has died, and the owner of the deceased animal gives consent for the organs to be used then yes, if someone is willing to try and give their pet a better quality of life this way, then they should be allowed.    We have pet insurance, we have vets, and we have inventions to give our pets a better quality of life.

He2WsvBcaa	198.2 amu  The chemical formula for Iron (III) Chloride dihydrate is  FeCl3 ? 2H2O  Why?  Because Iron has a charge of +3 (as can be inferred from the roman numerals (III)) and chlorine has a charge of -1, so the charges must be balanced in that compound.  +3 plus -1 plus -1 plus -1 which will give you 0, now it is balanced, and as you see that you need three chlorine atoms for every one iron atom for the charges to be balanced, so FeCl3 is your chemical formula for Iron(III) Chloride.  Dihydrate means that the Iron(III) Chloride crystal has water molecules attached, and as you can infer from the "di", you know that there are 2 water molecules, therefore it is 2H2O  So Iron(III) Chloride Dihydrate is   FeCl3 ? 2H2O  Now figure the formula mass by adding the atomic masses using your reference table, if you have one.    Remember that your answer will be in amu, not grams, because it is asking for the formula mass, not the gram formula mass.|`|1d7a1b7ab25d6e3edafff6c897a00d32aa	FeCl3.2H2O    add up those atomic masses and you're done

The great mass of ice is usually affected by gravity continuously moving the mass causing typical glacial changes to the topography of the land resulting in characteristic geologic formations. These changes are a combination of erosion, displacement, and deposits of the primary materials which form the geologic region.  Glacial recession in this century caused by global warming is exposing much more of the sub-glacial action of  the land illustrating the formidable power of the glacier.  Most of North American was once under a great ice sheet of the last Ice Age, a gigantic series of glaciers, and the features of the land are primarily defined by the history of Glacial action.

JdmwlvSRaa	plz be little specific|`|6ijHLZu8aa	I'm sorry if my formulas are sort of hard to read. First, plot the vertices (points of intersection on a triangle) formed by the lines and find out their coordinates. To find the perimeter, use the distance formula for the distance between each of the vertices (the lengths), unless it's a straight line (you would know this if the x or y coordinates are the same on both points). In case you don't know, the distance formula is the square root of (x2-x1)squared +(y2-y1)squared. If it's a straight line, the distance is just the difference between whichever coordinate is different than the other. After you have the lengths of all 3 sides, add all of them up to get the perimeter. For the area, use the midpoint formula, (x2-x1)/2,(y2-y1)/2 and find the distance between the top point and the midpoint of the base. This is the height of the triangle. Finally, use the area formula for a triangle, which is 1/2 of the length of the base times the height to get the area.

dlXqaxoeaa	This problem will be solved in 3 parts. We will solve for (a) the distance covered while the train is accelerating, (b) the distance covered while traveling at constanct speed, and (c) the distance covered while decelerating.    (a) First we will state what we know (givens):    u = 0 (initial velocity)  a = 1.8 m/s2 (rate of acceleration of the train)  t = 13 s (time interval over which acceleration takes place)    We will solve for the distance traveled while accelerating (d1) using the following formula.    d1 = ut + (1/2)at2  d1 = 0 + (1/2)at2  d1 = (1/2)at2  d1 = (1/2)(1.8)(132)  d1 = 152.1 m    (b) Before we can solve for d2 (the distance traveled at constant speed), we must solve for the final velocity from part a. This will be the velocity used in part b. To solve for this velocity, we will use the following formula.    v = u + at  v = 0 + at  v = at  v = (1.8)(13)  v = 23.4 m/s    Now we state our givens for part b.    v = 23.4 m/s  t = 59 s    Now we can find d2 using the following formula for constant velocity.    v = d2/t  d2 = vt  d2 = 23.4 * 59  d2 = 1380.6 m    (c) Now we know that the velocity from part b is the same as the final velocity from part a. That same velocity will be the initial velocity for part c (because this is velocity from which the train begins decelerating). Therefore, our givens are as follows.    u = 23.4 m/s  v = 0 (because the train is coming to a complete stop)  a = -4 m/s2 (negative because the speed is decreasing)    We can solve for the distance traveled while decelerating (d3) using the formula below.    v2 = u2 + 2ad3  0 = u2 + 2ad3  -2ad3 = u2  d3 = -u2/2a  d3 = -23.42/(2 * -4)  d3 = 68.445 m    Therefore, our total distance traveled D, is    D = d1 + d2 + d3 = 152.1 + 1380.6 + 68.445 = 1601.145 m = 1.601445 km|`|08e5e8bc7511de69179cd36f40aba62baa	Ok,     First segment: 1.8 x 13 = 23.4 m/s which means 11.7 m/s average  11.7 X 13 = 152.1 m  Next segment: 23.4 m/s x 59 = 1380.6 m   Last segment: Vf^2 = Vo^2 + 2ax  0 = 23.4(23.4) + 2(-4)(x)  x = 68.445m  Xtotal = 152.1 + 1380.6 + 68.445m = 1601.45 m

My non-expert advice:  read the directions on the package and follow them.    * Yes, you will likely die.  Your heart rate will slow down (called bradycardia), you will receive less oxygen in your body (hypoxia), your breathing will become difficult, and if nobody finds you, which I would say is probably likely, you will die.  Your heart will stop and then so will your breathing, and everyone will shake his head and say "I never thought it could happen to her."  Don't do it.

gxajLj7Eaa	Watermelon has a high water content (approximately 92%), and water has a very high heat capacity (about 4.186 joule/gram), which means that it retains its temperature better than most substances.  <br>  <br>  Think about a microwaved pizza pocket or chicken pot pie, something with sauce on the inside- you're more likely to get your tongue burned by the sauce than the outside or the other items inside it, because the water holds heat the longest.  <br>  <br>  In the same way, the watermelon, once cooled (though the cooling will take more energy than other substances) will retain that temperature for longer.

It is followed by groups who just happened to have special privilages, to keep such privilages.    Racism regionalism etc are bad traits acquired by affluent group of persons. This is the begining of the end of affluence.    In the USA, son of a black Muslim man and a white Christain woman, even though Christian, was elected as the president because the Americans wanted ecconomic reforms more than enything else. This shows Americans are intelligent and will survive this ecconomic crisis and continue to rule the world.    I believe that if United States were having a highly booming ecconomy now, Mr Obama would not have been elected as the president.    Genetic engineering cannot be used in a lage scale. But genetic principles can definetely be used. Arabs and Jews are children of same ancient king in different wives. Arabs marry cousines, but Jews do not. This is the only reason Jews have quick reaction time compared to Arabs in war and war like emergency.    In Kerala the first group of persons were converted to Christianity in first centuary AD by St Thomas and a later the Europians started conversion from 16th centuary AD. There Hindus and Muslims marry cousines while Christians do not up to five generations of blood relations. Even from firsy centuary AD, indivudial Christian families and the church keep a data bank on decendance. Before the marriage proposal is approved by the church, it is announced and all are permitted to object based on prohibited degree of blood relations.  A study in Kerala can prove that in general, decendants of those who were converted in first centuary AD are definetely much more superior in surviving in difficult times.    In other parts of India, tribal people converted to Christianity, are definetely superior to other tribals because Christians do not marry cousines. This causes hatred towards Christains. But I, a Hindu, am of the firm opinion that one need not be converted to Christianity, but it is sufficient to follow their principles of marriage. A tribal must marry another tribal, but not from the same tribe. Some tribals have less than one thousand populations in their particular tribe and will not marry from outside their tribe. Then their decendants will be like animals because they will definetely suffer from CONGENIAL SCHESOPHRENIA!

If the servo is to rotate the wheels, you could attachit directly to the wheels. If you want to use it to steer, you can hook it to the bottom of the cart. Your best bet is a custom holder, because you can do it anyway you like, but i'm assuming you don't have any welding supplies or experience. You could try tape or adhesives as well.    BTW, it's cool how you guys are doing stuff like this in your class.

SvmZlLdaaa	The most important thing for becoming a zookeeper is to gain experience with animals. Most zoos are more interested in this than in qualifications - I used to be a zookeeper and got the job without any qualifications other than G.C.S.E.s. Having higher qualifications is no guarantee of getting the job (my boss told me he's had people come in with degrees who didn't know which end an elephant craps out of!), and not having them is no guarantee you won't get the job. Volunteering at a zoo or animal sanctuary is a good way of getting experience - many zoos take on volunteers, and it's a good way of getting your foot in the door, so to speak, at the particular zoo you're interested in working at. You won't get paid, though, of course. Other things that are considered good experience with animals are working on farms and in dog kennels.    You also need to be able to work hard, not mind getting dirty (and I mean REALLY dirty!), and deal with people, in the shape of the public - this often requires a good deal of patience, as you will be asked the same question literally hundreds of times every day, and must always be polite however rude people are to you and however busy, tired and frustrated you are. Depending on which animals you're looking after, some degree of public speaking may also be involved - you might have to do a talk whilst feeding your animals, for example.    A zookeeper's pay is generally quite poor - I earned minimum wage. Many people want to work with animals, so they don't need to tempt workers with high pay. The hours are long and you may not be paid for any overtime worked - in the zoo I worked at, you were paid only between 8am and 5pm, even if you arrived at 6.30am and didn't leave til 7pm. You are also required to work weekends and public holidays without additional pay. It is definitely not a job you do for the money.    I must add that TV. shows about zoos paint a very unrealistic picture of what the job of being a zookeeper entails, making it appear that things like hand-rearing baby animals and knocking animals out for medical procedures happen every day. In reality, these things happen only rarely. The work is physically very hard, and you must work outdoors in all seasons and weathers. There is often little interaction with the animals you care for - the majority of the job is cleaning (picking up faeces, sweeping up straw, window cleaning, etc.). You also often do not have a choice as to which animals you work with - most zoos will simply take you on as a keeper and place you where you are needed, though you can request to work with certain animals if and when a position with them becomes available.|`|sZGzUmLDaa	the answer is on this website, it includes job prospects, salary, and job description, and education needed|`|FENf0rbzaa	well yeah you also have to make sure they stay healthy (what good would it be to keep a sick animal?)  i'm not exactly sure how much they make though sorry|`|65cBvdqraa	there are many things that zookeepers do.  there's WAYYY more things to do than just feeding them and cleaning up after them.    they make anywhere from $18,000-$20,000 a year  its really not that much.    go to this website. its got everything you'd need to know.    http://www.aazk.org/zoo_career.php|`|8wpav3nwaa	My school has one of the top zoo animal technology programs in the country. It's a two-year program. You can request free information from their website or talk to a counselor on the phone.

Zoo keepers don't normally make that much money, though it depends on if the zoo you work at is a tax zoo or not (meaning they receive tax dollars). You normally need a degree in biology or zoology.   I suggest that you volunteer at your local zoo to see if you would really enjoy it. That's what I did and I absolutely love it.
8Y7LQ6TGaa	these are medium low power, 3.9V 64 mA each.    A LED takes only 10-20mA to light it brightly, you should have 6 x 64ma or over 380 mA. That should be enough to blow out the LED. Re the motor, I have no idea what current it takes.     Are they in bright sunlight at the time? all of them? perpendicular to the sun's rays?  In the summer?     winter time, best will probably be half power, depending on where you live.    If you want to really test them, calculate the load, R = 3.9/6*64 = 10 ohms  power = 1.5 watts. Get a 10 ohm 2 watt resistor and connect it up. Use a voltmeter and see if you get the 3.9 volts.    or get a 61 ohm 1/2 watt resistor and check them one at a time.    .|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Are you sure you connected similar ends connected (all positive leads connected together and all negative leads connected together)?  Six of those panels should be able to supply about 6*64mA = 384mA or .384 amps at 3.9 volts (in full sunlight).  A lot less indoors. That should at least turn a small 1.5 volt motor with no load.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|dfQ8uDV2aa	hooking up in parallel increases current, so an LED will light. the motor however needs several volts, so try running in series.|`|pInY6rYqaa	When power is first applied to a motor the input current is at a maximum because the armature is not spinning and generating a counter-voltage.    This panel can only supply 64 mA under this condition.

Give it a twirl with your fingers and it will probably show some life.|`|qaMPEdL2aa	Try running your motor from a battery to see how much current it draws.

9Wi2eNInaa	Go to wikipedia and look up standard electrode potentials for hydrogen half-reaction and oxygen half-reaction    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_st...    That is the electricity in volts you get from this redox reaction. Now that is for one atom (+H)or one molecule (O2)    Now you have to find out how much current you need, which usually comes down to surface area on your electrodes to maximize the amount of  Hydrogens and Oxygens coming into contact.    As I said, you need those reactions to be happening in mass scale in order to get any current.     I would buy a small lab size fuel cell offering probably a amp at best and scale it up from there.    To get 700 watts is a pretty substantial cell and comes down to a large plate area ( two very large plates or put them in series and parallel to get the voltage you need and the current.     It's actually fairly similar to a lead-acid car battery. A car battery has 6 cells because the electrode potential of the lead reaction is 2 volts, so they put them in series to get the 12 volts.     But also within those six cells they put around 50 plates in parallel to build the current because a single plate might only be 1-amp-hour worth of power (generally they are looking for around 550 amp hours in total    Anyway your problem is making the membrane which allows the gas exchange and drawing off the current from that reaction. You need a good fuel cell book, because there is a lot to it with membrane selection and operating conditions    Here is wikipedia on fuel cells, but it doesn't give specifics about consumption of gases    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cells    Also here is a good sight on basics of fuel cell and from the section on hydrogen fuel cell you can determine hydrogen consumption by multiplying the electrical energy given out in kJ/mol  by the amount to equal your 700 watts of power    http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hba...    This sight gives some video and PDF and from their data could calculate hydeogen consumption from current generation    http://www.bigs.de/en/shop/htm/bz01.htm
Ei5m7K9naa	Edit: !!!You need to balance equation!!!    Firstly, your equation isn't balanced.  the proper equation is 6Li + N2 --> 2Li3N.  After that, convert the 15g of Li3N to moles.  Mol. mass is apprx. 34.7g.  15/34.7 = .43 moles Li3N. According to the ratio provided in the equation, you need 6 mol.s Li for every 2 mol.s of Li3N. [.43 moles x 2] / 6 mols Li = .14 moles Li needed.  the molar mass of Li is apprx. 6.9g, so [.14 moles  x  6.9 g per mol = 0.97g needed].  So in the end, you will need 0.97g of Li to produce 15g of Li3N.  That answer is with the correct significant digits.|`|KJHw0oI3aa	Start with the given amount of 15 g of Li3N, and use the dimensional analysis to find the number of grams of lithium.  In case you need a refresher on dimensional analysis, we use a number of conversion factors whose numerators and denominators are equal to each other in order to convert units by cancelling them one by one ending with the one we need.  Here we can use three steps to convert:    15 g Li3N to moles of Li3N  moles of Li3N to moles of Li  moles of Li to grams of Li    [(15 g Li3N)/1][(1 mol Li3N)/(34.830 g Li3N)][(3 mol Li)/(1 mol Li3N)][(6.941 g Li)/(1 mol Li)] = 9.0 g Li
9Wi2eNInaa	The answer is C     because the facts say the water is less than 2% so the answer has to be above 98% so the answer closest to that is 99%    The total mass of the hydrosphere is about 1.4  1021 kilograms, which is about 0.023% of the Earth's total mass. Less than 2% is freshwater; the rest is saltwater, mostly in the ocean.    Look at this link under physical properties    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceans|`|dCUOdbEbaa	I would say d. But not 100 percent sure.|`|YSx70imwaa	the answer is b|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	The oceans are huge. About 70 percent of the planet is covered in ocean, and the average depth of the ocean is several thousand feet (about 1,000 meters). Ninety-eight percent of the water on the planet is in the oceans, and therefore is unusable for drinking because of the salt. About 2 percent of the planet's water is fresh, but 1.6 percent of the planet's water is locked up in the polar ice caps and glaciers. Another 0.36 percent is found underground in aquifers and wells. Only about 0.036 percent of the planet's total water supply is found in lakes and rivers. That's still thousands of trillions of gallons, but it's a very small amount compared to all the water available.

LvnEbqxAaa	Humans are not autotrophs and therefore we do not make our own food. We have to ingest things in order to get energy so that our body can do work. We use what we get from food to do cellular respiration, which fuels the body. Without energy, the body couldn't perform basic functions, and the body would start to look for other sources of energy. It would use our fat tissue first and then start eating away at our muscle tissue (including our heart) until we died. So, therefore, we need our digestive system to extract necessary molecules from the food we eat. The excretion of waste products is also important, as it would be bad if wastes built up in our bodies instead of being excreted.|`|98BZdVGJaa	fi we cant eat or get rid of waste, we dieee.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Well, we all have to eat and have food and vitamins to live.

But if you want it in decimal form it would be approximately .667.  That is an approximation because 2/3 is an irrational number, meaning that the decimal goes on forever, so .667 is about 2/3, but not exactly.  It's best to leave it as 2/3.  You figure this out by doing 2 divided by 3 on your calculator.    3/3 is equal to 1.  Anything over itself is always 1.  8454/8454 is 1.    You can figure it out by memorizing it or just using a calculator.    Basically what 2/3 means is how many times does 3 go into 2.  2 goes into 3 about .667 times.  If it were 1/2, how many times does 2 go into 1?  .5 times.    Hope I helped a little with fractions.  ;)|`|VJ3NTPL7aa	The fraction "bar" means divided by. Any number divided by itself equals one.   3/3 = 1 because 3 divided by 3 = 1.  In a fraction, if the numerator (top) is less than the denominator (bottom), the number is less than one. If the numerator is greater than the denominator, the number is greater than one.   For example, 4/3 = 1 and 1/3.  To find equivalent fractions, multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number (remember, any number divided by itself equals 1), so it's legitimate to multiply a fraction by 2/2, 3/3, 4/4 etc. because you are really just multiplying that number by 1.  2/3 x 2/2 = 4/6  2/3 x 3/3 = 6/9  2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12    so ... 2/3 = 4/6 = 6/9 = 8/12.    Does that help? Good luck.

4c8ab139bf95dbc97c7afe8fa56e034daa	There were three phases - Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.    Mercury was about getting a person into space, Gemini was about two people and managing duration, Apollo was about getting to the moon - recall that Armstrong's mission was the 11th in the series.   Each time, they learned a little more - Apollo 8, for example, had the astronauts go around the moon.  Each and every mission helped the space program understand a little more about the space environment, allowing for a new challenge in the next mission.    It took seven years, billions of dollars, many, many technical innovations, and several lives - note the deaths of the Apollo I astronauts.    The big thing is that it takes a minimum of a year and a half to get to Mars, and another year and half to get back.  How are we going to provide life support for that time period?    Moreover, we need lots of fuel - enough to get out of Mars' gravitational well, and get back to Earth. This has to be carried 150 million miles.   The fuel, and the oxygen to burn it, must lift out of Earths well.  Cost is $6,000 per kilogram, just for orbit - not fully out of Earth's gravity.    And if anything goes wrong, the people die. I just don't see it.  If we're going to Mars, we will need to build the ship in orbit, because we will need decades of experience of living in vacuum, to ensure that we have the experience to properly design a capsule that will be successful for years in space.

BI02ykvZaa	The rule is, when you divide by a fraction, the equivalent is multiplying by its inverse.    For instance:  (a/b) / (c/d) = (a/b) x (d/c)    In your situation, this would work out to:  (3w-21/77) x (121w/w-7)    I won't solve the entire equation, but it's a matter of multiplying the numerators (top parts) together, then multiplying the denominators (bottom parts) together, then doing the division, if there are any common multiples.

w2nfvZ0caa	Related rates! Arg. D:    Baseball diamond. Square. 90 feet on each side. Player starts at first and runs to second at a speed of 16 ft/sec. I'd start by making a diagram of the problem (a tilted square). Then, since the problem has nothing to do with home base, I'd draw a line between third base and first base, and I'd ignore one of the triangles. So now we have a triangle with first, second, and third base as the corners. The problem tells us that the runner is 20 feet from first base (assume the runner is approaching second base), meaning the runner is 70 feet from second base. So now we know two sides of the triangle: 70 and 90. Let's find the third side using the Pythagorean theorem:    a2 + b2 = c2  702 + 902 = c2  4900 + 8100 = c2  13,000 = c2  114.018  c    So now we have all three lengths of the triangle. We are trying to calculate a decreasing distance rate from third as the player goes from first base to second. So, we are trying to find the distance "c" with respect to time. We know that the players distance with respect to time is increasing from first base to second base (as stated in the problem; we know this number is "16"). So let's take the derivative of the Pythagorean theorem (our operative equation) with respect to time. It's like implicit differentiation with ALL of the variables:    a2 + b2 = c2  2a(da/dt) + 2b(db/dt) = 2c(dc/dt)    We can substitute in the stuff that we know (I'll be using a lot of parentheses):    2(70)(16) + 2(90)(db/dt) = 2(114.018)(- dc/dt)    Note that "dc/dt" is negative, because the problem states that the player's distance is DECREASING.    So we have a problem. There are two variables. We're trying to find "dc/dt". Thinking this through, the problem expects you to realize that the distance from second base to third base is constant no matter what, so "db/dt" is zero. So now we can solve to get our answer:    2(70)(16) + 2(90)(0) = 2(114.018)(- dc/dt)  2240 = 228.036(- dc/dt)  9.823  - dc/dt  -9.823  dc/dt    So the answer is the player's distance is decreasing by 9.823 ft/sec.    I really hope you understood all of this; it's insanely hard to explain over the internet, so good luck. :)

YDF2yFEraa	Clearly a tongue and cheek Q. Very clever for those who got it. Let me explain for the benefit of some of the other answerers, here:    If a license was not a prerequisite to ensure minimal standards and to make money with a Medical Degree, then, other reasons for practising medicine would necessarily supersede "minimum" as well as any prospect of a pay check. Only humane, selfless, dedicated motivation may remain and serve as a replacement, which, of course is not a guarantee with licensing, but is extremely important, particularly, in complex or complicated cases. A patient wouldn't need a second opinion if money and self (especially, ego) weren't in the picture. Get it, Brrr?    Brrr, I know it is much easier to assume, but are you aware that mdGreg C IS a real doctor, a good one, too, maybe quite like yourself, except not so full of himself, clouded by ego, nor as presumptuous about the motives and character of other people. Just in your short answer, youve assumed who mdGreg C is, why he asked the Q, that most other doctors would agree with YOU; it is implied that patients aren't as educated as you are--needing "detailed explanation" etc, etc. LOL. I guess there are a few MD's kicking around that still believe patients respect them and see them as some sort of God. I don't want to burst anyone's bubble, so that's all I'll say. I do wonder as a PhD candidate in Psychology what lies beneath your smug, arrogant veil, Brrr?    Anyway, in my mind, a license ensures minimum standards are met and IS a ticket to make money. It certainly isn't indicative of effort, caring, knowledge beyond evocation of minimum standard, nor, common knowledge, life experiences, ability to employ logic, whether judgements are based on preconceptions rather than on observation, knowledge, and critical thought. In general, these standards aren't indicative of what kind of person the MD is and how these minimum standards are consistently applied in clinical settings. These are very important qualities for any human being to possess, but even more important for those charged with assessing and making decisions about a patient's *everything*--their health and the only thing that really matters.    EDIT: Definitely looks that way to me. Certainly makes a lot of space for the ego.     When dealing with a life, as well as other lives and allllll that touches, well, yeah, bare minimum really doesn't cut it, does it? But, a bureaucracy said it's enough, so, gee, it must be an indicator of ability, even though, evidently, so much more goes into it that isn't even considered.    I have known more than one MD (as well many other named, "experts") to hide behind a title. Higher, more comprehensive standards can only function to assist.    EDIT 2: Thanx, greydoc6. I am from Canada. *Totally* different can of worms, here.     In the states, what kind of assurance is there that MD's won't put their brains on a shelf after the criteria you mention, are met? What kind of assurance is there that MD's will possess pertinent "person variables" I exemplified above, all of which, impact "quality of care"?    In any event, learning should not cease upon graduation and certification, even at CME standards, but it often does. Greydoc, it seems the approval of CME revisions without discussion or objection, at least, indicates that people do want better standards. That's comforting.    One, hopefully, can readily envision situations and consequences associated with not taking personal initiative for more, without a provision of examples, off the top of *my* head.    In terms of what mdGreg C has added: what is the purpose of requiring MD's to be members of AMA for licensure? Sort of smacks of the "Cub Scouts" or "Brownies", a little. LOL.    EDIT 3: mdGreg C: A typical consequence of ego? Ego surely clouds reason, and of course, one can not reason with the unreasonable.    EDIT 4: Your latest edit reminds me of a friend who completed her Master's in Psych. Many years ago, she was pursuing a career as a "psychological associate" (aka, a psychometrist). She was made to join the CPA, which basically consisted of paying a handsome fee for the reception of the odd newsletter.

Often people would come back after a trip to a university center and say, "You were right."    One of my favorite jokes is the one about the patient asking his doctor for an opinion.  The doctor says, "I think you have gallstones."  The patients says he would like another opinion.  So the same doctor says, "OK, I think you have appendicitis."|`|BDKqYOSraa	A hearty ditto to my colleague greydoc.    Like many physicians, I strictly follow evidence based medicine and the standards of care/practice guidelines established for my discipline.    If a patient is unsure of my recomendations after detailed explanation and education,  I ENCOURAGE them to get a second opinion.   Why?    Because 9 out of 10 physicians will likely say the exact same thing or similar, validating my own advice.    I cannot comment on your "Stamp Act" question. I do not entirely understand what you mean.  It is clear that you have strong feelings against physicians, but that is your right.   Puzzling that the opinions of physicians are so important to you if you do not respect physicians...|`|5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	I'm sure you realize that not everything in medicine is black and white, and different doctors have different opinions on how certain diseases are managed.    And then again, you can't please every patient. You give your honest opinion. If they don't like it, they can seek another. Every doctor experiences this. It's a bit demeaning at first, but as you mature you realize that not every patient thinks you walk on water.    Edit: To Kynysca, the "minimum" standards you refer to are still darn high: exceptional grades in college, four years of intensive and increasingly expensive study, and then three to seven years of postgraduate work, supposedly limited to no more than 80 hours per week. Ha!  Then there's board certification which the best hospitals require prior to granting privileges. Then there's delineation of privileges, documenting that you are qualified to perform the procedures you request. These are minimum standards!    I don't know what the situation is in other states, but our state medical board is no patsy for bad physicians. Before I retired I was on my hospital by-laws committee revising upward CME requirements, ethical and professional standards. The doctors had three months advance notice prior to voting on the amendments. The revisions were approved unanimously , without discussion or objection.

From my own personal experience (not at all related to anything Moony or NASA) the comms aspect seemed a big obstacle.    One recent claim on another forum had them firing comms/audio/video up to a geostationary satellite that fired it back. Then it was pointed out that people could tell that with the accuracy of dishes and the moon not staying in one place etc that it was not coming from the moon and it became super duper space warping satellites that fooled the receivers for delay and direction and all sorts of other nonsense involving UFO's and aliens.    There is a video on youchube (part 11, you know  whom from) that deals with this idea slightly and is quite funny.

ggDknHJMaa	It should work  Alkaline and carbon cells supply 1.5V  NiCAD batteries supply 1,2V   NiMH batteries supply 1.2V  A Nine volt battery consists of 6 small Alkaline or carbon cells in series (6X1.5 = 9V) (trust me or take one apart and see)  When NiCADs were new a 9V NiCAD battery was still 6 cells (6x1.2=7.2V)  If you have a 8.4V NiMH battery (8.4/1.2 = 7) you have a battery with seven cells.   33 Years ago TI had never heard of such a beast.   Your nominal voltage will only be off by 0.6V from the 9V. I am not certain what the discharge voltage curve of the batteries looks like.  Perhaps you would like to take that on?  I think you will be fine.|`|yxnUBSJqaa	Yes.

Charge it up in anticipation of long usage and/or carry a back up battery (regular or NiCad).|`|2UAcrKQbaa	actually batteries haven't changed much  rechargeable act exactly the same  trust me

The first sign of a tornado is a strange quiet after or during a storm, sometimes the sky turns a pale green and mammatus clouds start to form.  Yes, as the name suggests they look like breasts.  Large hail is also an indicator of a tornado.  Next you might hear the sound of an oncoming train.  This is what many say a tornado sounds like.    Be particularly aware of rotating clouds.  If an appendage starts reaching toward the ground, take cover immediately.  Don't wait to see if it's a full-blown tornado.    Keep a portable radio with you so you can know when the storm passes, or if there's another one.    Edit:  If you live in the Lower Midwest like Oklahoma, be aware of "wall clouds."  These are also indicators of tornadoes.  You can't miss them, they're quite spectacular and scary-looking.      http://www.nerdtests.com/picsarea/7053a4...|`|AA10771653	Well the sky will probably look prettty nasty.  so yeah  and go to a closet and put a mattress over your head and duck|`|AA11965234	watch the weather channel and pay attention to the sirens..they should give you plenty of time to be safe.    also, go to anyone whom you know has a basement or go to the room in your house that has no windows. bathrooms work well.|`|gZ5m3o96aa	you can find out by radio or the tv. but if there is severe weather be on the look out. the forcasters should be able to tell you the likely hood of a tornado and your town should have a siren or somthing to let everyone one know that a tornado is coming. just make sure you take cover!|`|29ZL58Xjaa	The sky will look pretty nasty, and also with the following clues, will give you some indication that there is severe weather such as tornadoes on its way.    -- Heavy downpours of both rain and hail  -- Dark clouds that make it look like night even during the daylight.  -- Strong winds  -- A quick decrease in temperature  -- Fork Lightning  -- A temporary screw up of any geographical equipment  -- Also rolling effects in the clouds    If you notice any of the above signs, then look for the nearest overpass, or the nearest ditch, or lie on the ground protecting your head and back.

OXw0rv4Saa	I would bet that your day-time sleep troubles are caused by your night-time insomnia.    Before you step to Ambien (which is a powerful sleep medicine- it's very expensive and very addictive) please try to take one or two benadryl about an hour before you plan to go to bed every night.  Also- cut out any caffeine after noon, and check out the other healthy, drug free sleep tips on this website.  http://www.sleepnet.com/tips.html    Benadryl causes drowsiness in most people, and is an effective sleep medication for many.    Ambien, or other prescription sleep medications should be a very last resort.  Good luck!  I know how tough insomnia is, please try this first.|`|DhLIo8nbaa	Well I would say that the reason your having problems staying awake during the day is because your not sleeping during the night so if you got that taken care of then you should be okay.  Adderall is for ADHD and I highly doubt they would give you that because you have trouble staying awake during the day, alot of people have that problem, so I would say the probability of getting that would be slim to none.  But if you are having trouble sleeping at night Ambien can be an option but there are alot of options I think Lunesta is alot better because it seems to work better on my patients.  But its not that hard to get you just have to talk to your doctor about what your going through.  I hope this helps and you start sleeping.

AA6Aq94vaa	For any science, you would need to either spend some time in a lab or teaching, often both. Same goes for archeology. However for your research you could spend lots of time in the feild gathering evidence.      However, there are many fields in which scuba would be very helpful. You could go into oceanography, marine biology, or study coastal processes.   Most would require either geology, biology or in some cases chemistry (if you want to study seawater)   you could also study history or archeology, you would need a degree in history  Also you might want to consider being a scuba instructor or lead underwater tours     For a career in Oceanography you may want to go to Woods Hole Observatory in Falmouth Massachusetts. Contact them for more information  also speak to your college advisor for help in careers with scuba  One more is the Cousteau Society, though you need to speak French for a job with them

9iutgEYAaa	Its awesome that you want to help endangered animals!     The World Wildlife Fund is an organization dedicated to saving the animals of the world. They (and partner organizations) have all sorts of cool programs to get you involved in conservation. One thing they offer is a chance to symbolically adopt an endangered animal. Different cost levels provide different levels of help to that animal, but all come with a certificate of adoption, a cool fact sheet about that species, and often with a cute stuffed toy of that animal!    You can buy one yourself, or ask to receive one as a gift. I get an animal saved as my Christmas present every year.     http://www.worldwildlife.org    Also the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the overseeing body of the Endangered Species Act, along with partner organizations, offers opportunities to help protect and conserve endangered species.   http://www.fws.gov/endangered/kids/kids_...  Look up the species you are interested in on the FWS site and there will be links to partner organizations that are focused on saving that animal (or plant).    One crucial thing you can do is to be more aware of your impact on the environment and try to lessen it. Its not just litter and carbon dioxide that is a problem to the world's wildlife, but also human industrialization. A majority of products we use are made in ways that really hurt the environment, as are many of the activities we pursue. You can make a difference by taking a stand against current practices. Recycle and buy recycled material. Dispose of hazardous waste in the proper manner. Reduce the amount of fossil fuel energy you use. Support sustainable and renewable resource management.    The MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO is to help educate others about the problems facing endangered animals so that they can help too. You can even write to your congressman and tell him how important it is to you that endangered animals be helped. Trust me, you can make a difference.     https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welc...|`|8wpav3nwaa	I suggest going vegetarian, and this is why: livestock farming is an enormous threat to wolf populations in North America. Farmers want more land for their cows, sheep and pigs, and they fear losing their livestock (and therefore their profits) to the occasional wolf attack (which occurs much less frequently than they think it does). By not purchasing food and products made from animals, you will be joining the team of millions of vegetarians and making a difference against the meat industry. :)|`|3oP08mLQaa	yeah don't throw straws on the ground they go into sewage and into the ocean and get stuck in whales blowholes:(

F6IOLf3Aaa	It's an interesting thought.  One might even ask what shape was the singularity (if it can even be thought of in terms of "shape")?  My gut feel about this is that the universe is the same shape as the singularity.  What it appears to me is that inflation just stretched the singularity out in every direction with the minuscule undulations at the singularity becoming the seeds for matter, stars, galaxies, and nebula in the presence of gravity.    When one considers the cosmic background radiation (snap shot of the singularity at 300 million years post big bang) and take into account the phase transitions the universe past through, there are definite patterns to nature that is telling us and showing us far more than pretty stars in the night sky.

OGVnFtHsaa	Photosynthesis is a carbohytes' formation proccess which requires solar light. However, some studies have discover that it could also be possible through artificial Light (Green works better). I mean, it is only logical, because the plants with clorophils recieve the light. "Cloro" comes from the greek "?", which means "Green, yellowish green", so that's why green works better :).    So deeper into chemestry and physics, we can say that "cloro"phils reflect the green light of the visible light. (That's assuming we do understand that Visible Light is composed of different colors (we all remember from middle school, Look at the rainbow?)  Yes, the green is like the third color (if i remember well). And therefore the plants absorbs the rest of colors and rejects the green, making it possible for us to appretiate the green.    A plant that does not recieves light is pretty much dead. It gets the energy from the sun, and with the absorbtion of water and CO2 plants produce its fruits; this proccess is also extremely good for it also liberates O2 (Oxigen) which is essential for life as we knowin earth.|`|ZahjlUioaa	yes. light is necessary for photosynthesis. plants chlorophyll (which makes it green) needs light to convert water, sugars(carbohydrates), and CO2 into energy. Or what us plant physiologist call it ATP and NADH+. Light is an activator that triggers the process for energy so the plant can grow. Now just think like when we go outside in the sun we feel warm right? So we become more active due to the activation of the enzymes within our body from the heat. This is similar with plants. When light hits the leaves, it warms them up. This warmth, just like us, makes the leaves chlorophyll more active which produces energy.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	um duh|`|vxTcvSYdaa	yes|`|AA11965234	yes; hence, PHOTOsynthesis
CCeRdaoLaa	The stereotypical loudmouth American part of my brain (a very small part) wants to say "Psshht!  We'll go first, 'cause we're America!"  The rational part of my brain knows that isn't right, though.  The easiest solution might just be to draw lots.  The optimistic (and perhaps naive) part of me would like to believe that history would focus on the unprecedented international cooperation, rather than the nationality of the first person to step onto Mars.    Alternatively, though perhaps trickier to work out, I'd set up a wide platform just outside the lander (nothing fancy, just a wide piece of metal).  A representative from each nation could simultaneously step down onto the planet, and each recite a speech to be recorded through their individual suit microphones.    I think you're right, though.  If and when the time comes, there will be much political wrangling to determine who gets the honor.  And, as a side note, Ben Bova's books are awesome.|`|vPqk1SGHaa	I think the most appropriate language to be spoken during the human mission to Mars is Gibberish, that's because human mission to Mars, at present, is about the dumbest thing that can be done.   Robotic missions are cheaper. Robots can do better job than humans. Robots do not have to be brought back.  However, the most important thing is the criterion of success. Robotic mission is a success when it sends back some data. Human mission is a success only if the astronauts return safely to Earth. For example Pathfinder completed most of its primary mission and then contact was lost. That mission is called a great success. Astronauts of Columbia completed their mission and perished during return flight. That mission is called a disaster.   Sending humans in space is counterproductive for space research.

uv6eCTibaa	A ouija board, also known as spirit board or talking board is any flat board with letters, numbers, and other symbols, used to supposedly communicate with spirits. It uses a planchette (small heart-shaped piece of wood) or movable indicator to indicate the message by spelling it out on the board during a sance. The fingers of the participants are placed on the planchette that then moves about the board to spell out messages. Ouija is a trademark for a talking board currently sold by Parker Brothers. While the word is not considered a genericized trademark, it has become a trademark that is often used generically to refer to any talking board.|`|AA10008098	The name means 'yes/yes' in two languages and the planchette operated by finger pressure can answer questions yes or no or spell out answers or give numeric answers.  Although some believe that it can be used to communicate with spirits it is diffulcult to prove.  Others use a swinging pendulum suspended between thumb and index finger to answer questions yes or no caused by the pendulum swinging back and forth or side to side.

There really aren't any jobs in astronomy if you don't have a PhD in the field, and that's 8-12 years of college.

96145621c75947c84171b675f275b9cbaa	1. One requirement for the Hardy-Weinberg principal to apply to a population is that it must be extremely large. In a large populaton, changes in genotype will not completely alter the allele frequencies. However in smaller populations, a change in the genotype can dramatically change the alle frequencies. For example, in a population of 1000 flowers, there are 500 blue ones and 500 red ones. In the next generation, if there are 480 blue ones and 520 red ones then the allele frequency has not really changed. However in a population of 10 flowers, if 5 were blue and 5 were red, then a change in genotypes in the next generation would fluctuate the allele frequency dramatically.    2. It is neccessary to get an appropriate sample size of the population in order to get an accurate portrayal of the population. A sample size that is too small might leave out some genotypes or might contain too much of a genotype that is not really common too the population. An appropriate sample size of the population will include an accurate representation of the allele frequencies in the population.    3. The Hardy-Weinberg equation, p2 + 2pq + q2, approximates what percentage of the population are homozygous dominant, heterozygous and homozygous recessive.

He points to the ancient Maya cyclical calendars, the longest of which last renewed itself approximately 5,125 years ago and is set to end again, supposedly with catastrophic consequences, in 2012. He speaks of the ancient Egyptians, who, he claims, saw 2012 as a year of great change too. And he points to science: NASA predicts a sharp increase in the number of sunspots and sun flares for 2012, he said, sure to cause electrical failures and satellite disruptions.     All this adds up, Geryl said, to unprecedented catastrophe. First, a polar reversal will cause the north to become the south and the sun to rise in the west.

AA10031563	Yes  Yes  Yes    That is annoyingly complicated. If you just want to get the answer to your homework question, you can always go to google and type in "3789 kg/m^3 to g/mL"    But to do it in class, take each unit separately.  There are 1000g in a kg. So multiply by 1000.  Then there 1000L in a cubic meter, but it's in the denominator so divide by 1000. (We're back to the number we started with)  Then there are 1000mL in a L, and it's still the denominator, so divide by 1000.  And you get 3.789, just like Google.

AA6Aq94vaa	Usually, the more felsic the rock, the violent the volcano. Volcanoes with more mafic rocks tend to have gentler eruption.  Felsic magmas are usually more viscous and it takes more energy for gases to escape from them than it would for magmas that are more mafic. Mafic magmas are less viscous and flow very easily.   Volcanoes such as Krakatoa, Vesuvius, Thira (Santorini) and Mt.Lassen are more felsic and tend to have highly explosive eruptions   Volcanoes such as Etna, Kilauea and Hekla are more mafic, There eruptions tend be gentle with flowing lava.    Felsic are rocks that are rich in silica and feldspars    Mafic are rocks high in Iron and magnesium.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The 'spirit' knows everything about you because it IS you.

You're just freaking yourself out.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	So if you don't like it, why do you continue to use the board? And how do you know it's really your cousin Andy? Just b/c it says so? What IS your "special way" to make a ghost answer a question that you know it's the truth? Cause that's the thing about playing with ouija boards. It's an open portal and you attract everything with it, the good and the bad. Simply by opening that board and asking any and all spirits to come and talk to you, you're inviting them into your house and into your life. Good AND bad. And in my experience, it's the bad that always shows up first. How would you really know if that was a demon that was playing you? Cause I've seen that before, more than one friend got sucked in by a demon pretending to be someone nice. That's what they do. When you open the board, do you ever ask to speak to andy? how do you know it's THAT andy you're getting? or andy at all?     I mean no disrespect, but do you see what I mean? To get rid of him... stop using the ouija board and tell him to go in peace. STOP going back to it.

Your reaction and feeling are very human, and I think your concern in normal. However, you can rest assured that this type of thing has been thoroughly studies by legitimate science and here is what they found. The ouija board runs on whats known as the ideomotor effect. You actually can control the planchette unknowingly with subtle muscle movements.   One of the big studies done of the ouija board was by a group who created a fictitious name of a person who they said died in a location. The ouija board users were able to come up with all kinds of information and history of this fictitious person who they thought they were talking to. This experiment proved that they were not talking to the dead.   How do they know this? Get 2 friends to help you. Have one friend read the board while you and the other friend put on a blindfold.Your friend will then turn the board around after your blindfolded. Ask Andy all the questions you want, and you will get absolute non-sense.   Andy isn't blindfolded, so this means that either you or your friend are controlling the planchette.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	"Andy" knows things only you know because you are Andy.  Bear with me here.  The Ouija board operates via a phenomenon known as the ideomotor effect.  What that means is you are actually moving the planchette, but subconsciously.  It happened to me too when I was a kid.  I played with the Ouija board with a bunch of friends.  It would only work when I was using it and it provided answers only I would know.  A simple way to test this is to have your friend and her mother do it while asking questions only you would know.  I bet Andy can't answer them.

So in the fact that i know none of your history, and that you say he is now following you, i don't believe he is in the board, you have let him out into your world, and created a hole in both your and your friends home. it no longer matters what you do with the board because it is to late, and if for some reason you decide you are going to still use the board, you should probably make sure you are protecting yourself properly    just what ever you do, Do NOT try to burn the board.     trust me on this if this is the only thing you listen to out of my answer.. i have had my mistakes with ouija boards, and if you burn it i promise you, it will not get any better.|`|BqdqSRvLaa	Although some of these are very good explanations to a wicca board.. I don't buy into the "Andy is you" theory simply because of an experience in which 3 people were "playing" with one, but one of the 3 wouldn't lay his hands upon any parts of the board but had the other two ask questions only he knew the answers too and whatever connected to the board was able to answer every single question he had these 2 others ask. And no.. these 2 others didn't know a thing about what he was having them ask about.   My suggestion.. break and burn that board.. you need to do this to break any link in with  the spirit  you connected with. These things shouldn't be played with. Science cannot answer every thing connected to the paranormal, esp with a wicca board. take my suggestion and add in that you just don't play with the spirit world. it can turn ugly.

There is not much that can be done to figure out how to write 7.6 as a fraction, except to literally use what the decimal portion of your number, the .6, means.  Since there are 1 digits in 6, the very last digit is the "10th" decimal place.    So we can just say that .6 is the same as 6/10.      The fraction is not reduced to lowest terms. We can reduce this fraction to lowest  terms by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2.      Why divide by 2? 2 is the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)  or Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of the numbers 6 and 10.

Its really difficult to keep primates as pets, and keeping them happy and entertained without them developing lots of psychological problems is very very tough. Volunteer at a zoo to get some experience first if you are completley set on getting one.    My advice is to look for other similar, but less difficult pet such as a sugar glider. Do loads of research, wait 3 months to see if you still want one.|`|65cBvdqraa	monkeys do not make good pets  they aren't meant to be pets  most monkeys are taken out of the wild and they don't deal well in houses with people that arent capable and dont have experience.  do not get a pet monkey.  do not get a chimp.  chimps are not monkeys they are apes by the way.  chimps look cute when they're babies  but they get big.  they get agressive.  they couldnt survive in a household environment.     it is not a good idea to have any sort of primate as a pet.  do not get one.

96145621c75947c84171b675f275b9cbaa	1. One requirement for the Hardy-Weinberg principal to apply to a population is that it must be extremely large. In a large populaton, changes in genotype will not completely alter the allele frequencies. However in smaller populations, a change in the genotype can dramatically change the alle frequencies. For example, in a population of 1000 flowers, there are 500 blue ones and 500 red ones. In the next generation, if there are 480 blue ones and 520 red ones then the allele frequency has not really changed. However in a population of 10 flowers, if 5 were blue and 5 were red, then a change in genotypes in the next generation would fluctuate the allele frequency dramatically.    2. It is neccessary to get an appropriate sample size of the population in order to get an accurate portrayal of the population. A sample size that is too small might leave out some genotypes or might contain too much of a genotype that is not really common too the population. An appropriate sample size of the population will include an accurate representation of the allele frequencies in the population.    3. The Hardy-Weinberg equation, p2 + 2pq + q2, approximates what percentage of the population are homozygous dominant, heterozygous and homozygous recessive.|`|nEw1ZccTaa	A smaller population will have less sequence divergence in alleles.
MJp1KJu9aa	zinc is a metal with a positive charge of 2  to balance its charge it must combine with a nonmetal so that the molecule has a total charge of 0 (neutral).  zinc may combine in a one to one ratio with:  (these elements have a charge of negative two) oxygen, sulfur, selenium, or tellurium   one to two ratio:  (these elements have a charge of negative 1) fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, or astatine  two to one ratio:  (these elements have a charge of negative 4) carbon, or silicon.    these are the simpler molecules zinc forms, more complex molecules would include boron(-5), nitrogen, phosphorus, or arsenic(-3)    so basically zinc can combine with any nonmetal element (except the noble gases)|`|cwQ4lbd5aa	Binary compounds of zinc with nonmetals are well known. Of the four halides ZnF2 has the most ionic character, whereas the others, ZnCl2, ZnBr2, and ZnI2, have relatively low melting points and are considered to have considerable covalent character.[citation needed] The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions, but which dissolves in both strong basic and acidic solutions. The powder is widely used as an additive into numerous materials and products. The other chalcogenides, ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnTe, have varied applications in electronics and optics. Asides from the pnictogenides Zn3N2 (notable for its high melting point[17]), Zn3P2, Zn3As2 and Zn3Sb2, other such binary compounds include the peroxide ZnO2, the hydride ZnH2, and the carbide Zn2C.    In weak basic solutions containing Zn2+ ions, the hydroxide Zn(OH)2 forms as a white precipitate. In stronger alkaline solutions, this hydroxide is dissolved to form zincates ([Zn(OH)4]2-).[citation needed] The nitrate Zn(NO3)2 (used as oxidizing agent, the chlorate Zn(ClO3)2, the sulfate ZnSO4 (known as "white vitriol"), the phosphate Zn3(PO4)2 (used as primer pigment), the molibdate ZnMoO4 (used as white pigment), the cyanide Zn(CN)2 (used as a catalyst in a few organic recations[18]), the chromate ZnCrO4 (one of the few colored zinc compounds), the arsenite Zn(AsO2)2 (colorless powder) and the arsenate octahydrate Zn(AsO4)2?8H2O (white powder, also referred to as koettigite) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. The latter two compounds are both used in insecticides and wood preservatives. One of the simplest examples of an organic compound of zinc is the acetate Zn(O2CCH3)2, which has several medicinal applications.|`|yWdNphcGaa	Thanks for the tips cheif    Check wikipedia.

Kil7sZUSaa	1. Density of fresh water is 1,000 kg/m^3, thus 10 million kg is equivalent to 10,000 m^3. Answer is e. 10^4m^3.    2. Q = AV, thus for constant flow the velocity of the fluid is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.  Since the area is proportional to the square of the diameter, the velocity is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter.  The ratio is (3/6)^2 and the answer is b. 1/4.

He2WsvBcaa	You can tell it is a solid because the melting point of carbon is 3820 K, or 3547 C and since the standard temperature is 0 C, you know that carbon is a solid at room temperature. Most periodic tables give you the melting and boiling points of the elements, and to make it easier for you, some periodic tables just give you color codes so that you automatically know the state of matter of the element at room temperature, or STP.  By the way, carbon is absolutely NOT a metalloid, it is a nonmetal|`|797Bf914aa	Many periodic charts use the color of the symbol to indicate the state of the element, with black often being the color for a solid.  Alternately, some charts actually print the melting point.  Some people just memorize the 2 liquids and remember the gases are to the right and the top.    Charcoal, diamonds and graphite are carbon and are solids.|`|MGDV8Q8vaa	You can't unless you have a periodic table that has a color code for solids, liquids, and gases.|`|f1734c79346c98e938e588703c7ac31faa	Its a metalliod.

v2Kv13nXaa	They are good pets...they are a bit boring, especially when they are just hanging out in their shells. make sure you keep water in the tank, but also, make sure they have a way OUT of the water or else they will drown. Also, they need a variation of different size shells in their tank because unlike many other crabs, they do not excrete calcium carbonate to make their own shells, so if they grow, they need to change shells. If they don't have shells to change into, they will grow to large and die.    Other than that, they are really easy to take care of, and also very cheap. you can handle them too...they don't usually pinch people.

2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	I guess they don't teach any basic science in school anymore.    What you saw was called the first crescent of the moon.  Happens every month, in a cycle called the phases of the moon.  Every month, the moon orbits the Earth and we see only the part of the sunlit half that is facing us - we only see the moon by the sunlight it reflects to us.    2 nights ago was "new moon", when the moon was between the Earth and the sun and so the entire sunlit side was facing away from us.  Now the moon has moved enough in its orbit that we start to see part of the sunlit side.  Keep watching, and each night you will see more of the sunlit side until in about 2 weeks it will be full moon.  Then each night you will see less of the sunlit side until the next new moon (2 weeks later).|`|pt6wIlS1aa	There was a solar eclipse recently: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/...

Gracious, I weighed that much back in grammar school. If you multiply that by 9.8 m/s/s (thanks to Mr. Isaac Newton, he-he) you'll have the total force each leg is putting on that poor floor. So let's say that's something like 184 N apiece.    Now what? Well, that force is over a small area, a radius of 0.01 m.

Ironic huh, scientists even did studies on it, confirming this metal was not a Earth resource.  Look it up, you might have to do some digging though.  I know its their because ive seen the site.  Also how do you explain about 500,000 people seeing the exact same thing at the exact same time but in different arease of a state.  Yet the government claims their was nothing in the sky at that time, that they know of.  Watch the History Channel or go to their website, they have a lot of documenteries on UFO's and they show documenteries of files that the government has released on UFO sitings.  You will see that some of the words that are stated on the forms are marked out.  Mainly because thats the things they dont want the citizens to see.|`|hO7g5Y9taa	Clever aliens could be standing right behind you and you wouldn't know it.

Humans didn't just appear suddenly; the fossil record shows them evolving slowly over a period of millions of years.    Like many people, you seem to be confusing UFOs (things seen in the sky) with aliens (living creatures from another world). Not the same thing at all!    UFOs (unidentified flying objects) are only unidentified because the observer lacks the astronomical or meteorological knowledge to identify them. That's why you never hear about UFOs observed by astronomers or meteorologists; they're only reported by people who are unfamiliar with what can be seen in the sky. I've been an amateur astronomer for over fifty years, and have never seen anything in the sky that I haven't been able to identify.    Although life almost certainly exists elsewhere in the universe, the immense distances between stars makes interstellar travel practically impossible. No scientist has ever been able to examine a real alien, so all descriptions are nothing but fantasy.|`|PH9Vl1xwaa	You have a lot of good questions. Here are some good places to look for answers.

Rectangles are easy to deal with:    Area = xy  Perimeter = 2x + 2y    It tells us that the area is 16 m2, so use that in the area equation:    16 = xy    Solve for one variable:    16/x = y    Substitute this into the other equation:    P = 2x + 2(16/x)    Simplify:    P = 2x + (32 / x)    The domain?

rdENr9BWaa	The excretory and pulmonary systems both remove wastes from the body and maintain safe levels of molecules.  The pulmonary systems (respiratory and cardiac system) carries carbon dioxide rich blood to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide diffuses out and is exhaled from the body, and oxygen enters the bloodstream and is brought to the required cells.    The excretory system "filters" blood (the kidneys are pretty complex), but basically the liquid portion of blood passes through the kidneys and good ions and water are reabsorbed, while urea, a nitrogenous waste from the breakdown of proteins, exits the body through the urine.  Both of these systems get rid of byproducts that could be harmful to the body, and main a constant environment (homeostasis)

f4d90c6153afed6517f6a6304b30df86aa	This is a hard question to have a right answer to.  Spiders will avoid humans but as we increasing take over space we get in the way.  People thinks spiders only bite but their natural defence is to make them self look bigger by spreading the front legs exposing their fangs, if that don't work then they size up and decide whether to run or not.  If a spider thinks it could be a meal then they will bite.  With humans most of the time when bitten we shake and this cause the spider to fall off and most of the time run away.  When it comes to our cloths or shoes they bite in reaction to fear.  In the UK we don't have to worry about poison because most of ours are not deadly, but in america where a lot of spiders have venom the affects humans they will shake shoes and cloths out, those that don't will get bitten at some point.|`|uFVDWp7xaa	as far as im concerened there is no published % and it depends on the spider but it is really low.    they dont bite without good reason though  eg. you rolled over on them or family member

5H7Wgaknaa	It very much depends on the observer's latitude. On the equator, it would take about 2 minutes because the Sun is moving perpendicular to the horizon.. At other latitudes, it moves at a shallower angle. For example, at latitude 50 degrees, it takes about 4 minutes. From the north or south pole, it takes more than a day because it is a function of the Earth's orbital motion, not its rotation. Atmospheric refraction makes the Sun appear higher in the sky and will tend to slightly increase these times.|`|W2suykEtaa	depends.    the Sun always takes the same amount of time to pass the same distance across the sky, BUT it takes a different time to pass across the distance of differing ELEVATIONS due to the angle it makes with the horizon.

oVz6sPsIaa	It's a parabola with vertex (-1,-2), line of symmetry x = -1, minimum value -2, no maximum value.|`|D4Ko5ll2aa	Very conveniently, your parabola is in vertex form. i.e, if f(x) = (x - a)^2 + b, then the vertex is (a,b). So, the vertex is (-1, -2).    The line of symmetry is the vertical line going through the vertex. Vertical lines are in the form x = a, and we want it to go through (-1, -2), so x = -1 is the line of symmetry.    This function has no maximum, since you can make x as large as you want, and the function will grow bigger. The function does have a minimum though, because the term in the squared brackets will always be greater than or equal to 0, so -2 will be the minimum. It's no coincidence that the minimum is the same as the y coordinate of the vertex.    Hope that helped.|`|CcFH0TLzaa	vertex ( -1, -2)  line of symmetry x= -1  max and min you are gonna need a graphing calc.  1 got to y= type in the eq.  2 then hit 2nd calc and hit max and do what it tells you  repeat 2 but hit min instead of max|`|cJPrkRagaa	Cant exactly graph right here but it would be a normal quadratic only shifted one left, and two down.  Its vertex at (-1,-2).  I find this by seeing that the function given is in VERTEX form.  This allows you to find the vertex by small arithmetic means.  First you look at inside the operator, or the x term.  ***Whatever makes inside the operator (inside the parenthesis) zero, is the X coordinate of the vertex.  So in this case, it is -1 because x+1=0 -->x= -1.  Then whatever is left on the outside is the Y coordinate.  y=-2.  SO the vertex is (-1, -2)      The X intercepts are found by using the square root method, or FOIL ing the binomial and adding the constant.  Here it is easier to do the square root method because it is designed to do it that way.  You move 2 to the other side, and take the square root.  THen you move the +1 over to become -1.  So u have x= -1 PLUS OR MINUS sqrt(2).  THere are the intecepts.      Line of symmetry cuts through the vertex, so it is x= -1.     In this case it is a minimum value because the parabola opens up.  Its Min is at (-1,-2)
8fca5c297d662977a4d7b03db1ae059baa	do you mean freshwater or saltwater otters??    I was under the impression freshwater otters dug out "nests" in river banks or at least used natural crevices in river banks as a sort of den. They definitely use something similar to that...    And saltwater otters couldn't really use anything underwater to make a den, since they'd still have to breathe, and they don't hang out around on land much... that's why they tether themselves to seaweed when they sleep. I guess in that way they "make" a shelter from drifting out to sea at least...

It all started when Dr. Robert Harrington of the U.S. Naval Observatory has some theories about the probable existence of Planet X. Some years later, he left for an expedition to New Zealand from which he believed to be the best place to observe it. After some months of research and observation, he died from a mysterious cancer shortly before announcing his findings. The whole story died with him, and if you look for official information on Dr. Harrington, you will read that he had already discarded the possibility of this planet a few years before their dispatch.    After some years, in 1997, has surged a comet that became famous as the Great Comet of 1997, the Hale-Bopp. Many people believed that this comet was on a collision course with our planet, and even for some time the space observatories were worried, because it really became very close to Earth. Indeed, if he had been here 3 months before, the possibility of a direct collision would be very large. Many comments were made on the comet, and even mysterious about the lack of official information and photos from space agencies regarding it, many other independent and amateur astronomers began to make comments on their own. One independent astronomers photographed what appeared to be a "company" of the comet. According to this picture, it would be a much larger company. This photo was discussed in the Art Bell's radio program, a major critic of NASA and well known in the United States. Few days later, 38 people from a sect called "Heaven's Gate" was found dead by suicide in a house. According to official information, they committed suicide so they could reach such company of the comet, which they believed to be a spaceship that would get them. But the real story was not that well.    Once the news of these deaths cames, Art Bell was blamed by the media to have disclosed to this picture and hence the death of those people, and soon after the NASA confirmed that the photo was false, and that had been manipulated by the person that delivered it to Art Bell. That was a big hit on their behalf, and unfortunately he has not been able to defend itself, since he died of the same mysterious cancer that killed the scientist Robert Harrington. But the photo was genuine, and this whole scheme had been manipulated by NASA and the U.S. department of defense. The "disciples" of the sect were not really religious or anything like that, they were systems developers, and were creating a system of encryption and firewall that even the computers of the office of U.S. defense could break. Were killed one by one in the house where they were found, one after another while going inside. Pictures of the comet and his company were left at the crime scene, and a fake site was created immediately about them. And from there, the whole scheme was created in 2012, because those pictures and information regarding the comet were true, and many other more important things could still be found.    After some years, the name zetatalk appeared on the Internet, according to its creator, Nancy-some-thing, she received telepatic messages from extra-terrestrial beings, which in 2003 warned that a large planet known to us as Nibiru was coming to our Solar System, and would bring with it the apocalypse. Many books and DVDs were sold on the subject for this site. Some time later, Mark Hazzlewood released books on the same subject using data taken from the site zetatalk but eliminating the telepathic contact with aliens to make the story easier.     Many other books and DVDs were sold by him. Of course nothing happened, and now these same people returned to their sites and their books, but this time with a new date: 2012, the year in which the Mayan calendar "ends" and when the holy city of Shamballa would make visible again. It is logical that it is the same campaign which took place earlier. And in that gap of time between 2003 and 2012, much material came from the Internet, and I believe that over 90% came from zetatalk's site and from informations from Mark Hazzlewood's books. The curious thing is that the creator of zetatalk is married to an important person of NASA, and that Mark Hazzlewood moved in with his girlfriend to Canada to get rid of charges related to his books.    Before we go back to the issues of the comet Hale-Bopp and the Planet X, it is important that you know of some studies that were originally developed by Belikovsi and since the 1970s are being performed by Dr. James McCanney. In this model, other than the current model used by scientists to understand the mechanics of celestial bodies, there is what he calls "Electrical Space", where intense interactions of electromagnetic order occurs between them. In this model, although all the theory applied physics is exactly like the current, the electromagnetic interactions between the different celestial bodies count as much of the calculations to be made, not only the|`|cFze3RQbaa	I'm not sure what's gonna happen but what   i heard and said is the ff:       - the mayans calendar stops at the year 2012...            as you know mayans are smart in astrology and mathematics   some people believes:       - that at 2012 is the end of the world       - that the mayan calendar is just a cycle that after 2012 it'll start at         1 i think (not sure)    if it really is the end of the world i sure hope not because i'm still 13.  if it's not real then think of it is there any other calendar that goes back to 1..............

na67p30Kaa	Well, it depends on the situation.  Assuming the object is on a flat surface with no other force acting on it, yes: normal force is the same as the force of gravity.    Otherwise, you have a think a little harder.  The normal force (almost) always balances out "the other force".  Most of the time "the other force" is a component of gravity (in the case of an object on a ramp, etc.).    For example, if you have an object on a ramp, you have to rotate the axis of the forces and break up the force of gravity into its x and y components.  One component will try to pull the object down the ramp, the other will be balanced out by the normal force.    As another example, take a roller coaster on a loop.  At the top of the loop, the Fn is not balanced out by anything else.  So, you have to use Fnet = ma.  Fg + Fn = ma.  Solve from there.    When in doubt, draw a force diagram and solve using Fnet = ma (or Fnet = 0 if the object is not moving).    Hope this helps.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	9.80 or 9.81 is the gravitational acceleration. In other words, neglecting air resistant, a falling object falls 9.80 m/s faster than one second ago.    Gravitational force is equal to the mass of the object times the gravitational pull. Normal force is the force reacting against the gravitational force. If the object has no other vertical forces applied to it and is at rest vertically, then yes, the normal force is equal to the gravitational force which is equal to 9.80 times the mass of the object.|`|b3xvrPcVaa	mgcos(x)    where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and x is the angle between the surface the object is resting on and the surface of the planet.

The colors are in that order as well, starting from V and ending in R.    The lightning is scattered through cloud (water droplets act as lens). You are looking through that lens from earth.

l4anfnt7aa	Ok, you want to go straight across, but every second you will be pushed .57m downstream. So, rowing at a rate of 1.3m/s you need to move .57m upstream every second. If you break the 1.3m/s into two vectors you have a right triangle. The hypotenuse is 1.3m, the side parallel to the river is .57m. The side perpendicular to the river, if we call it "a" is:  a2 + .572m2 = 1.32m2 = 1.32m2 - .572m2 = 1.3651m2  a = sqrt(1.3651)m    From here we have enough info to tell how long it will take to cross the river, but not which direction to head. So let's figure that out. Consider the angle between side "a" and the hypotenuse and let's call it angle x.    x = cos(a/1.3m)  = cos(  sqrt(1.3651)m/1.3m) = approximately 0.62radians    So the angle going clockwise from upstream would be :  (pi / 2) - cos(sqrt(1.3651)m/1.3m) =  approximately .95rad or 54.33 degrees. Going counter-clockwise from upstream it would be 305.67 degrees (360 - 54.33)    Now, back to the time it takes to cross the river. Traveling in this direction, you will travel sqrt(1.3651)m/s towards the other side of the river (recall side "a"). Again, the river is 63m wide.   Time = Distance / Rate  t = 63m / [sqrt(1.3651)m/s] = 53.92s|`|720e77b7e8651ed9139e41aa6fe09f9caa	First think of relative velocity equation  Velocity of boat wrt Earth = Veleocity of Boart wrt river +Veleocity of river wrt boat  B,E=B,R + R,E  | v = \ 1.3 + --> 0.57 (v is perpendicular to the upstream and dont know the direction of B,R)  We can represent velocities in following diagram        0.57 >   ________   \             |     \           |       \         |           \       |   .13   \     |             \   |               \ |    from the diagram the direction you should head can be found  it is arccos (0.57/1.3)    (b) From the diagram by applying phythogoaras theorem,  v= sqrt(0.57^2 + 1.3^2)  time taken is 63/v|`|CV0XxjMuaa	http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1D...
TL1Jkqunaa	Its called the angular conservation of energy.  No matter what the skater's position the skater produces a certain amount of energy per second.  When his / her hands are extended the distance of the rotation is larger.  When he pulls his hands in the weight is unchanged.  TO keep the energy at the same amount the difference has to be made up by increasing the number of spins per time unit.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	In the short term, her rotational momentum is a constant. When she pulls in her arms the radius of momentum is reduced so the velocity has to increase to preserve momentum.|`|lFfRs4Draa	the rotational momentum of the skater remains the same.  That is, v1i1 = v2i2    However, when she pulls in her arms, the moment of inertia (i) gets smaller   ( because moment of inertia is equal to the integral of r^2*dm ) so velocity must increase to conserve momentum|`|na67p30Kaa	The inertia of a particle depends on its distance from the rotation point.  In the case of an ice skater, assume the weight of the arms are the "particles" and the spinning body is the rotation point.    When the arms are pulled closer into the body, the radius is reduced.  Therefore, the inertia is reduced and the body turns "easier" and therefore faster.    Another way to look at it is to use conservation of angular momentum where Inertia * angular velocity has to equal Inertia * angular velocity.|`|CV0XxjMuaa	the bigger the mass of something is, the bigger it's inertia is. so if the iceskater pulls her arms in closer, she is becoming smaller, and decreasing her intertia. the smaller an object's inertia, the faster it goes.

Charles Darwin was the first person to prove the theory.   Evidence for theory of evolution are:  1.Fossil Records  2.Comparative Anatomy (homologous structures)  3.Comparative Embryology   4.Molecular Biology (protein, DNA sequence)|`|AA11513203	Since evolution means "slow change in the species over time", the question is just, how does natural selection cause the species to change over time.    It's quite simple.    Individuals do not all reproduce equally.   Some individuals are born with traits that give them some advantage in survival or reproduction over other individuals in the species, and therefore will leave more offspring that have those same (advantageous) traits.  Thus, the advantageous traits increasse in the population over time.   The population changes ... it is evolving.       That's it.    -----    P.S.  I have to disagree with 'Mr. Physics' sentence; "Charles Darwin was the first person to prove the theory. "    You don't "prove" theories in science.       In science we don't deal with "proof", we deal with *EVIDENCE*.   The reason this is important is that thinking that theories are or are not "proven" leads to the same lack of understanding about science that Creationists have whenever they utter the words "just a theory."|`|C0i3t4graa	Basic question::::: If evolution is true why are there still apes? Is science confused?|`|sXZWQRGdaa	First, understand both.    Evolution is change in a population of a species over time by way of the modification (called mutations) of traits passed down from parent to offspring.  http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary...    Natural selection is the process that encourages traits that are beneficial in an environment, and discourages traits that are detrimental.  http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary...    Natural selection doesn't exactly "bring about evolution", it guides it!    Populations of organisms change, or evolve, either way, but natural selection is one method of guiding that change.  Others are Genetic drift, Geographic isolation, and gene migration.  http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary...    A famous example of natural selection are the peppered moths of England.  Peppered moths relied on camoflage to avoid predators.  They matched the local trees very nicely.  There was a mutation that caused the moths to be a darker color.  These darker moths didn't camoflague as well, so they couldn't reproduce as well, and the lighter ones flourished.  Then, in England, the industrial revolution came and factories were thrown up quickly, covering the trees in soot.  This turned the tables on who camoflaged better, and soon the dark moths outpopulated the light ones.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_mo...|`|1Te4sfqIaa	This is actually a very simple and intuitive process.  Natural selection is the mechanism by which species change over long time periods.  I'll illustrate by example.      Lets say we have a generic species A that feeds on the fruits that hang from a tree.  Now lets say that due to foresting most of the shorter trees have been cut down.  Now you can see that the shorter members of species A will no longer be able to reach the food as easily as the taller members of the species.  In that way eventually the ones with genes that make them shorter, will have a harder time surviving and reproducing while the taller ones will do better.  Over time the taller genes will become dominant and we will see an average increase in height for species A over time.      There are of course many other examples that one could use.  Any conditions where the environment favors certain genetic traits more than others will lead to those traits eventually becoming more common in the species.  Hence evolution.

Your body is made up of mostly of water. Approximately 85% of your brain, 80% of your blood and 70% of your muscle is water. Every cell in your body needs water to live. You can see how important water is to you.     Water helps remove the dangerous toxins that your body takes in from the air you breathe, the food you eat and the chemicals used in the various products you use on your skin and hair. Other things water does for your body is to cushion your joints. Water carries oxygen and nutrients into all your cells. Water also helps regulate your body temperature.     You need water to keep your metabolism working properly. In order for this to happen, there is a certain level of water in each of our bodies that we need to maintain. If we dont keep that amount, our bodies will start to dehydrate. An easy way to think of it is to think of your cars need for oil. If your oil level gets too low, your engine will start to run rough. If you totally deplete your oil supply in your car, your engine will stop running. Same with your body. Therefore it is easy to see why it is very important to drink six to eight glasses of water a day.     Some of the things that may happen to your body if you do not have enough water are that your blood pressure can fall to dangerously low levels. Blood clots may form. Your normal kidney function is impaired. You may get terrible constipation.        Some of the signals your body gives you of a low water level are constipation, terribly dry skin, and increased incidence of urinary tract infections and reoccurring headaches.     There are ways other than ingesting water that are beneficial to your body. A popular way to reduce fever is to take a bath in cool water. This helps bring down your entire body temperature, thus reducing fever. The use of water in this manner is called hydrotherapy. You will probably find you have used one or the other of these methods at some point.     Many people today swear by hydrotherapy as evidence by the many hydrotherapy spas around the world. Hydrotherapy is the therapeutic use of hot or cold water to alleviate or relieve problems. These therapies include steam inhalation, cold compresses, hot baths, showers, steam baths, and whirlpools. Hydrotherapy is often used for sports injuries.     The use of hot water helps to stimulate the immune system. It also increases your bodys circulation. Think of how many times you needed a bath to recuperate from a rough day. You soak for minutes or even hours. When you get out, your body feels less stressed and more relaxed. What do people do after theyve had a hard workout? They take a steam bath or relax in a whirlpool.     Cold water is used to reduce inflammation. For example when you sprain your ankle, you use an ice pack to reduce the swelling. A cold water sitz bath (or regular bath if you can stand it) is used to treat constipation, irregular vaginal discharge, hemorrhoids.     Some treatments using alternating hot and cold water are to relieve upper respiratory problems, congestions, foot infections, and headaches.     There are other types of hydrotherapy to treat more serious problems but these should only be used by trained professionals as if not done properly could possibly cause more harm than it will do good.     If you are interested in further information about hydrotherapy, look in your local yellow pages or on the web under spas, health resorts or physical therapists. Always consult your health care provider before starting any new treatment including hydrotherapy.|`|DMkvSPNhaa	water is essential to life because all life forms are dependent on it.

The Earth is located in the habitable zone of the solar system; if it were slightly closer to or further from the Sun (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometres), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.[14]  Earth's mass allows gravity to hold an atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a greenhouse effect which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in polar ice caps (as on Mars).  It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation (insolation), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. This proposal is known as the Gaia hypothesis.  The state of water also depends on a planet's gravity. If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity.  There are various theories about origin of water on Earth.|`|6Dec7NFPaa	Your body is about 75% water and without it we would die.

ndjVs0ELaa	In recent decades some scientists began to challenge Plutos classification as a planet. Its much smaller size, icy, cometlike composition, and association with the Kuiper Belt set it apart from the other recognized planets in the solar system. The term ice dwarf was suggested to distinguish Pluto from the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Arguments in support of continuing to call Pluto a planet despite its small size included its spherical shape, its differentiated internal structure with a rocky core surrounded by layers of ice, the presence of an atmosphere, and a set of moons. The strongest argument, however, may have been historical: People have called Pluto a planet for more than 75 years.     In 2005 astronomers announced the discovery of an icy planetlike body slightly larger than Pluto and with a more distant orbit around the Sun. The new object (now officially called Eris) was given the temporary scientific designation 2003 UB313 and the popular nickname Xena. 2003 UB313 was the largest known of a series of planetlike KBOs found in recent years and was an indication that the outer reaches of the solar system may contain hundreds of such Pluto-like planetary bodies. If Pluto ranked as the ninth planet, then the larger 2003 UB313 logically could qualify as the tenth planet. Whether it would be officially recognized as the tenth planet depended on how Pluto was classified.    The status of Pluto drew world attention in 2006 when the official body that governs the naming of astronomical objects, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), voted for an official definition of the term planet. According to the standards adopted, a classical planet must orbit the Sun, must have a rounded shape from effects of its own gravity, and must be the dominant object in its region of space, having cleared the neighborhood of its orbit of other bodies as it formed. The IAU erected a new category called dwarf planets for bodies that orbited the Sun and had a rounded shape from their own gravity, but were not massive enough to have cleared other objects from around their orbits.     The new IAU definitions removed Pluto from the solar systems classical planets, now reduced to eight, and made it a dwarf planet along with Eris (2003 UB313) and Ceres (formerly the largest asteroid). Pluto and Eris orbit through the Kuiper Belt, while Ceres orbits in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, a zone scattered with thousands of small rocky bodies. The IAU also made Pluto the prototype of a new class of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that includes Eris, Sedna, Quaoar, and a number of other major KBOs. In a further move, the IAU gave Pluto the official minor planet catalog number 134340.     The IAU rulings came after much debate, including a scrapped proposal to recognize Pluto, Charon, Ceres, and Eris as true planets. The results of the final IAU vote were controversial and met strong opposition from a range of astronomers and planetary scientists, some of whom refused to recognize or use the new definitions. Possible future actions may modify the IAU rulings on Plutos status.

mnratgMWaa	First find the interior angle at H.  The total degrees for a quadrilateral is 360.  We are given there are two 90 degree angles and one 125 degree angle.  Therefore 360 - (90 + 90 + 125) = 55 degrees.  Interior angle at H is 55 degrees.  Exterior angle would be the difference between 180 (supplementary angles) and 55 degrees.   Therefore, 180 - 55 =  125 degrees.|`|wUmJaLDcaa	The measure of the exterior angle of H is 125 degrees because angle M (90) + angle A(90)+ angle T(125) =305.  To get angle H you would subtract 305 from 360 and get 55 degrees.  To find the exterior angle you would then subtract 55 from 180, which is the total measure of the interior and exterior angles.  This would give you 125 degrees.    Hope this helps.|`|1JjZZ7mlaa	You haven't given enough info to correctly answer the question.

8wpav3nwaa	This is a complicated question in disguise! It turns out, the usage of the common names 'frog' and 'toad' have no real taxonomic basis. (Both frogs and toads belong to class Amphibia, order Anura. All members of Anura are frogs, and family Bufonidae('true' toads) is a member of Anura.) Therefore, all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads.    That information is practically useless to someone who is just curious about the creatures in their garden, though. So, the general rule of thumb is: toads have the bumpier, drier skin, less webbing between the toes and tend to prefer land habitats. Frogs are the smooth, wet/slimy/sticky guys with the webbed feet that tend to be hanging out really close to the water.
