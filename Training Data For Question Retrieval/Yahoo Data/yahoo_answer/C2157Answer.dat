eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."    The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.    It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.   All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption and guesswork.    A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).    The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.    The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.    If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.    It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|AA10025824	Pick a category you're good at and answer a lot of questions only in that category.|`|a2708e7f671d2c5308a7fca7225d05d4aa	A top contributor is someone who is a member of the community in yahoo answers.  They are the people who have proved they are knowledgeable in a selected category.    Yahoo Answers has a nice selection of categories  to choose from however polls and surveys and jokes and riddles   don't get the badge.  You need to get at least 10 percent in best answers although this may have gone up.  Answer about 45 - 50 questions a day in a particular category   each week.  The length of time it can take to get the badge can be 4 - 6 weeks.  Yahoo Answers reviews everyone each week they determine the following  any new people ready to earn the badge   or   any one who has it removed due to lack of participation or  the lowering of best answer percentage   Once you earn the badge its important to remain active in the community because the badge is not permanent and can be removed.  A person can get it back by going to the category where they lost it   answer question in that category   Each Monday morning the top contributor badge is placed or removed from under the avatar.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	A top contributor is someone who has answered enough questions in a certain category or certain categories to get the badge. You ideally need ten percent best answers in the category you choose to achieve the TC badge in. The only two categories that don't give out TC badges are Polls & Surveys and Jokes & Riddles. You can receive the badge in up to three categories.|`|IxoBFCpTaa	>>How to become Top Contributor ?    ?? To become a Top Contributor, keep these things in mind ??    ?? Choose a category ??    ? Pick a specific sub category of all the categories you see to the left of the page. For example, if you are good in science and mathematics, you do not receive a Top Contributor's badge for that category but for its sub categories such as Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc.     ? You can have a badge in up to three categories which will show under your badge on your profile as well as your id card, which is what you see when you scroll over an avatar.    ?? Answer a lot of questions ??    ? Answer many questions in the category that you choose. I would say 25 Answers per week should be a near minimum.    ? Make sure you mostly answer questions you think you will receive Best Answer to. You need a certain percentage of Best Answers and the more you answer without thinking about this, the harder it will become to get a Top Contributor's badge.    ?? Best Answer Accumulation ??    ? Your answers should be to questions you believe you will receive a Best Answer to. Try to answer those questions that have very little or unknowledgeable answers because that gives you a better chance of receiving Best Answer.    ? The Percentage of Best Answers needed is 10% in the category.    ??Activity & Contribution??    ? When you gain the Top Contributor's badge, you have to constantly be on the site.  However, you do not have to not have a life as many people say. Simply 1 hour a day would probably be enough. Remember, this contribution is about 25 answers per week.        ??Here are some Hints??  ? The Y!A staff keeps the formula hidden so users will not abuse their rights. But the formula seems to be like this:    10% Best Answer Percentage   200 points per week    ? Users qualified for the badge will receive it on Monday Morning 12:00 AM California time.  ? Two categories do not provide a Top Contributor's badge because they are only for entertainment; these are:    Polls & Surveys   Jokes & Riddles  ? It is okay to vote for yourself with your only account when your answers to questions are in voting. However, it is not okay to use multiple accounts to do so as this is considered cheating.     ? ? ? ?   ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ?      Peace ?  ^_^

MRrzsnLcaa	Uh, best guess you mean the welcome screen that lists all your unread messages and lists whatever folder they are in...    Easiest way I know to "get around" this screen, is to click on your inbox screen, and Bookmark it, (Favorite for all you Internet Exploder users out there) and use that to get to your inbox when you are logged into Yahoo!?

xU7AaQOdaa	Whilst you do lose 5 points initially, by asking a good question you can actually gain points.    Most questions that I answer I tend to find interesting, and so I click on the "interesting" button, and by doing so the questioner gets 1 point for a "star". The most stars I have seen on a question is 16, so already the questioner is 11 points up.    When the questioner votes for "Best Answer" they get another 3 points, so in the above example they were 14 points to the good. Also, there is the satisfaction of giving other people something to answer!    You can't take the points to the supermarket!|`|d7OswsvMaa	lol..its jst lyk dat..|`|vcx06TdQaa	that's just how it is.

AA11930204	I don't think this a dumb question at all.  In fact, if you think about it, you can apply the question to how we experience life.  When we take the time to search for the answers for life's questions, we get a lot more out of it.  We learn, and the people we give the information to learn, as well.  When we ask a lot of questions, we're not really taking the time to learn anything for ourselves.  We're letting other people do the work for us.

Most places don't typically hire people under 18. Because when you're 18, you can work when they say with little restrictions, but when you're younger, you have to have a work permit and can only work certain times and that gets frustrating sometimes with employers|`|eKdRjaySaa	you can be any age it depends on the employer.<br>  the age which she will get her NATIONAL INSURANCE card so she can work in places such as JDSPORTS/ SAINSBURYS/ any retail store/ or places that have a PAYE system (Tax), etc... then it'll have to be 16 (and will only be active on 31st July of her last year at secondary school (year 11)... although she'll receive the card sooner.<br>  <br>  some newsagents and private own stores would employ her...<br>  but pay peanuts,. literally, there's no minimum wage...<br>  minimum wage kicks in from the age of 18 <br>  :) <br>  hope this helps|`|FhWOpW4waa	With the exception of a farm, If you are under age, you will need a work permit from your school in order to get a job.

If your friend is looking for a full-time job then the most likely age would be sixteen, because by British law, you have to be in school until the age of sixteen, but then you are allowed to leave school. But, you must consider the consequences of leaving school because the job recommendations of GCSEs can only take you so far, if you don't take A-levels or have a diploma of some kind then it is unlikely that you would progress far in life. But, if your friend wants to have a steady income of money then she/he could ask for a part-time job in the sweetie shop during the summer or other holidays. though what is most important is considering the long term effects rather than the short term. <br>  Hope this has been useful.|`|nfzCnvAvaa	For most jobs its 16 <br>  but if she wants she can wait one year and work in the cinema.<br>  the only inconvenient is that you have to work minimum two times during the week.|`|Ljb9kEx7aa	well it depends its usually 14 and up but some times it can be thirteen ive seen it before but it all depends really.hope i helped:):)|`|mK0joOuIaa	i think 14....but i don't konw because i'm italian<br>  <br>  here at theage of 16

I know if you don't pick your words very carefully someone will hit the abuse button and your gone for a while.  A real good friend of mine who was on level 7 got suspended and got now to level six by the time he was given back his activity on Q&A.  He was supended for 3 or 4 weeks. He did have his e-mail because we would send e-mail everyday to each other.  They told him he had used  inappropriate language on several answers and that he was in violation of the set forth guidelines.  You know all it takes is someone that doesn't like a question or reads the answers of a question and they will hit the abuse button in stead of just leaving the site and not comming back.

I am not as skinny as my aviator... the correct thing for yahoo would be to allow us to adjust the body size....      But your question is why....  I believe it is because our society is obsessed with looks... it is so embedded in our culture that someone didn't think that women would want their aviators to be able to be a little more "thick"... they assume that we all are craving to be very skinny because society has taught us that is the only way to be beautiful...

Try just holding hands first -while you watch a movie or while you are walking together.  When you palms stop sweating, then think about your first kiss.

AA10063943	Currently, Yahoo! Messenger does not have an Affiliate Program.    Yahoo! has a form which allows you to submit suggestions, bugs and other experience issues for Yahoo! Messenger. You can find the link below:  http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/messen...    I've got good news and I've got bad news. You can START an IM conversation with your friend from your website but you'll HAVE the IM conversation through Yahoo! Messenger AND you and your friend have to be running Yahoo! Messenger on your respective computers.    Here's how.     1) Collect a list of your friends with Yahoo! IDs and who have Yahoo! Messenger running on their computers. (e.x montecristosandwich, laura543, tedd_openheimmer92)    2) You'll need to know how to write some HTML code for this part. Using this tool: http://messenger.yahoo.com/addpresence.p...  Input your list of Yahoo! IDs one at a time. The tool will generate some code for you to use which displays your friend's Yahoo! ID and an icon which tells you if they are currently online or offline. HINT: If you look at the code you'll notice you only need to replace your friend's Yahoo! ID where it says .target= and online?=u.     3) Paste this code into an unordered list and you are ready to go.       [PASTE CODE HERE from TOOL]      I would also check the Yahoo!

Try to sign in a view your contacts and make sure it still doesn't work. Now click "Submit Logs" in the Help menu. Be sure to put in a brief description of the problem, and then Send    It saves out diagnostic information about how the program is running, it's communications with the Messenger servers, your computer settings etc. You can then submit the logs to Yahoo! along with a description of a problem you are having. The logs will help Yahoo! debug the problem and fix it.
AA10063943	You can create your own custom Status messages:     1. Click on the status chooser at the top of the Messenger and select New Status Message.   2. Type your custom status (such as "back in 5 minutes") and then click the OK button.   3. Your custom status will appear after your ID.     Note: Old custom Status messages will be deleted as you create new ones.     Unlike MSN, you cannot currently put emoticons in your status messages or change the text color.
AA10063943	To show a display image:     1.  Go to the Yahoo! Messenger menu and select "Preferences."   2.  Click "Display Image,"  make sure the "Enable display images" is checked  then click "Change Default"  3.  Select the checkbox next to "Share my Picture", and click "Select"  Now click "Browse" to find a picture on your computer to use. When you find the picture you want, click "Open."   If you have multiple images in My Pictures, make sure to click on the image you uploaded in the grid of pictures.

Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!

You can get one at http://360.yahoo.com . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to put four pictures there by following the instructions.

You might want to try this also. It solves a lot of Yahoo! problems:    1. Sign OUT of Yahoo! and get off the internet.  2. Clear your browser's cache files. (see link below)  3. Restart your PC (Reboot).  4. Get back on the internet and Sign IN to Yahoo! Homepage.    It's a good idea to do this often. In fact, you should Sign OUT of Yahoo! everytime you are done.    Hope this helps.|`|MmBuqilCaa	Yahoo has been having problems and is working on them. You might try a disc clean up on your PC, this some times opens things back up again.

xGRh8k2Baa	Hopefully a pretty simple fix.  Before you click on the Text Box button on the side go up to the top with file and edit and all that and go to the "Image" tab.  From there go all the way to the bottom and the option "draw opaque" is probably checked.  Just uncheck it and that white background should be gone from behind your text.    The only thing to be careful of is make sure that the text is exactly where you want it because to move it you would have to use that dotted square option and select it before moving it, and that would take the picture behind it with it, leaving a messed up picture and a white hole.|`|1NwYBrThaa	well, click on the text box, then under the tools, there should be a white square and a regular dotted square.     Click on the dotted square and type in what you want (:    Hope this helped!
5e0755e06d5f4f1b24b497cc9427c910aa	Use calculated shipping on the selling form.  Assuming you're in a country that offers calculated shipping like US or CA.

Get your PayPal account up and running before listing.|`|M3KKhk3Laa	do you have a paypal account to begin with? that's how you are going to get your money. first you need to visit www.paypal.com and create a account.  when you get payed, after your item is sold you could ether order a check from paypal to pay you are if you had a bank account that you linked with your paypal, you can send the money directly in your bank account.
HBM1qu0Saa	When you downloaded the pictures to your computer, did you take note of where the pictures "went to"?  You will need to know where they are so that you can browse to that folder.    Start an email. Go to "insert" on the menu, choose, "File attachment"  then browse to the folder that has your pictures.     A warning though, if the picture you are sending is over 5 megs, it will probably not send at all, or it can take a long time to send depending on your internet connection speed.|`|TiKlwqDEaa	go on ur emai  it should say attach file  click on that  find ur pictures   then send them!

WqGOaR4Qaa	it's probably not working because your computer probably has a virus.  the way to clean up virus is you can always take it to a computer place or fix it yourself by downloading a software that will clean up your computer!
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	In order to use a separate email program, such as Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, or Thunderbird, with Yahoo Mail you need POP3. It is free in the UK but in the US you must pay for Yahoo Mail Plus.  It is also required when you try to transfer the mail using smtp or pop3 to another online email.  When you do you can set the servers as follows:  Incoming (pop3) - plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com (UK pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk)  Outgoing (smtp) - plus.smtp.mail.yahoo.com (UK smpt.mail.yahoo.co.uk)    ? ??l???q ?
