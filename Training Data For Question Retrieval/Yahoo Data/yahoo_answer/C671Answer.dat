95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Take a lover!|`|bmoCpcdraa	a whole hour and a half, wow, what is it 30 min, to get there and 30 min, to get back so, 30 min, to spend, so, maybe you should chill out, if you put him on a leash and bark orders at him ,he will wake up and realize that you are not the only female on this earth, you probably the type that gets a job at burger king and think that you are the only one that can do that job,,,so chill out or he will find someone new,,,the children should always come first, i'm sure you new he had a child before you married him,|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	It sounds as though it has turned into a monumental piss-up. Some men, after the nth pint, forget everything and anybody under the fug of alcohol-induced frivolity.<br>  <br>  If the child is 30 then your hubby is about my age -52 - and I would venture to conclude that you are of similar age. I also have to assume that this child is from a previous relationship.<br>  <br>  The best that I can say is that I entered into a relationship 12 years ago, after 40 years of bachelorhood, and I told my partner, as soon as we got serious about each other, that I am a lover of good beer and that, if she could not accept the fact that I would be out twice a week at the pub, then it would be better if we did not pursue the relationship further. (my partners is teetotal and hates pubs). We reached an agreement that is acceptable to us both, and that still works.<br>  <br>  What I find bad about your Hubby is that he has not bothered to call you and say that he would be late, and, even worse, he has left you eating an overcooked dinner made for two.My partner does not cook - she can cook, but she leaves it to me as she is not enthusiastic about cookery whereas I am - I'm a Chef - (though not working in the trade at the moment). If I'd prepared a meal and she was not home to eat it without good reason. I'd go ballistic!<br>  <br>  Your hubby is sufficiently mature in terms of years to understand what I am saying. Whether he loves his child more that he loves you I could not answer until I have his views. If he has family from a previous relationship then he is entitled to see them and make appropriate whoopee, and, on the occasions that he does so, make it clear that you will not cook for him<br>  <br>  I do not cook after 19.30 hours; period. If my partner goes out then there are microwavable meals in the freezer for her. You need to set similar rules.<br>  <br>  In short, your hubby has been inconsiderate of you. I cannot answer if he is putting the child before you as I don't have enough info, but I do feel that you need to set some boundaries.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	His child will ALWAYS come first, as a mother yourself I don't see why you cannot understand this. You don't stop being a parent when a kid turns a certain age. He is probably out celebrating with her, good on him!<br>  <br>  I don't understand. It's just one day, can't you entertain yourself for just one day? Don't you have hobbies or a life of your own to occupy you? This is not the end of the world. He is spending quality time with his kid, you should be proud of him for wanting to be in his child's life. Quite frankly, he should be the one who is angry about the way you are acting. You are being selfish and also controlling.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	I think this problem would be solved if you attempted to be closer to his family.  You should also be attending this birthday party.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	You two need to work this out..confronting issues is wise..|`|fiXHKUc3aa	why dont you just casually ask him about it, <br>  i mean it is his son.<br>  dont start an argument though... its not worth it.<br>  just ask him why he missed dinner when you asked him to be there.<br>  does he see his kid much?<br>  if not maybe thats why he wanted to spend time with him.<br>  doesnt seem like a big deal to me.|`|UywxrfGdaa	i wudnt like the cannabis bit his daughter sounds like a rite 1 but yr daughter will *** across it anyway its within our culture now its everywhere!  o god its so easy to get jealous wen u r left out. u shud tell him that. even though it is his son he should still b thinking of yr feelings to! he is yr husband and u r his wife.i wud go mad me! ha!|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Well, this is how life is with him.

e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	Sometimes it is hard for us to accept the fact that people don't feel the same way about us when we have a sexual relationship with them.  Just remember this <br>  A woman will use sex to get a relationship<br>  A man will use a relationship to get sex.<br>  <br>  His heart is not in it.|`|djUMvICoaa	Sounds like a player, he's got you where he wants you, around his finger and twisted like a pretzel.  He is sending you mixed messages, I believe you do, makes you feel good, but as a friend, like he isn't going to make any commitment to you.  Take it from there, but I wouldn't waste any more of my time.|`|3iNobwVraa	Um, well, I think that was a gentle way of telling you he doesn't feel the same.  I'll be more blunt since you seem to be asking for a direct translation: "I know you believe you love me.  I care about you, but do not feel the same."  <br>  <br>  I think you would do yourself a favor if you stopped thinking of him romantically.  Be friends, if you can, or walk away, if you can't...that's all I can think of.  Sorry.|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	He doesn't want to lead you on.<br>  <br>  You can't force someone to love you in the way you want him to love you. Accept it, and good luck finding someone else.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	because he is saying that he sees you as a friend. pretty to the point answer to give a person.|`|yHJpLxtyaa	You have officially been 'friend zoned' sorry :(|`|4e5c321b3099a1f6ff699e8cd693bc94aa	He doesn't love you. move on and don't waste your time .|`|kTUL01tfaa	so you quit hanging on him|`|0e5aeac0b9db1edd4e79c50eed3109f2aa	Because that is what he means..stop saying I love you expecting something different. When he begins to really feel the same LOVE you do, he will clearly state it with nothing added. And if he doesn't go seek the love you feel you deserve.|`|qDGOi5Xqaa	He doesn't love you.  He is looking for nothing more than a friendship.  Don't embarrass yourself any further by putting your heart on your sleeve for someone clearly not returning the feelings.|`|sFqsTXvwaa	Hmmm, could it possibly be that maybe he likes you as friend?|`|UGOse5Dvaa	Ummm....<br>  'Cause that is what he means.|`|Cpwedckvaa	He's telling you that he isnt IN LOVE with you...move on|`|B359bLqsaa	if this is your husband who says this to you then you have a serious problem.  it means he is cheating on you or otherwise just does not love you anymore.|`|AA10248966	he likes people, but does not love you|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	You cannot make yourself feel something you do not feel, but you can do right in spite of your feelings.Love him enough to let him go. People have told me that they love me & even though I couldn't not say it I did. That is pretty mean. You deserve better.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	What Brandie said. Sorry.|`|veZLfnGFaa	He's saying he loves you, but he isn't "in love" with you.  You're a friend and he wants it that way.|`|G6Uy43coaa	He loves you as a friend only...don't seek romance there...it won't be found....sorry.

UCgNMbkDaa	i think you are being a bit of a baby about it.<br>  when you think about old customs. yes the man bought the ring, but the woman paid for the entire wedding. and sounding like you didnt pay much for a wedding, then it doesnt hurt that you paid for your ring.<br>  and in the end you are married, so you probably share a lot of expenses. so does it matter if you technically paid for the ring?? <br>  maybe down the road when you two are better off financially he will be able to buy you the ring he wanted to get you.<br>  besides a lot of couples end up getting new rings when its feasible.<br>  so take a breath and be happy that you are married, celebrate your new edition to the family.<br>  don't worry so much about something material.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Your marriage and vows are what's important not a ring.  That is just a symbol.  When I got married what was mine became hers and vice versa.  That included our money.    You have a ring on your finger and I'm sure he would have bought it for you if he could have afforded it so don't stress about it.  It will just make him feel horrible about it and he probably won't want to wear his out of guilt.|`|VJiWuikpaa	If your married should you not have this thing of who has more money and who has more in their account why dont you both say its both your monies what you earn. cause he should be able to get money from you if he needs it and if that was the case you wouldnt feel that way about your ring, i can understand how you feel like that but you know how things are with money and you should be happy you have on you married him wit out a ring so does it matter now.. yes its nice to show off to the world that you both made that commitment but is it better to show the world that you both love each other and you gorgeous new baby girl than anything else..<br>  <br>  But i do feel as a married couple you need to be equal although your saying shouldnt the man pay for the ring your also making it quiet clear you earn more and can pay for more, you want to be looked after by him but unfortunately at this time it obviously isnt the option for yous, i do think that you both should have your own money, why dont you both agree to have a certain amount of your wages for you to save for gifts for eachother or to do with what ever you both like and put the rest into a family fund..<br>  <br>  i hope you and your family are happy

t8f7FCvuaa	Well, he could be trying to encourage you to lose weight since you seem to be concerned about it.  He may not be doing a good job at it, but that's quite possibly what he's doing.  Just because what he's saying doesn't sound the best doesn't mean he's intending it to be taken wrong.  Some people just don't know how to word things right all the, especially men when speaking to women.  And you should also encourage him to put on some pounds.  I'm thin, 5'10 and 165.  I also work out.  He should be putting on more weight.  Still, you're not fat and that shouldn't dictate your dating.  If he is being a control freak can dictate that however . . . i wouldn't date a control freak unless you're really out of control and need someone to ground you a bit.  Just saying.<br>  <br>  And eating past 12 AM or 12 PM?  You really shouldn't eat so close before going to bed though, so unless you intent to to go sleep at like 5 am, you shouldn't eat past 12am.  Like 2-3 hours prior to going to bed.  That's just being healthy, not controlling though.  I break that rule enough though, =/<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say he's being a jerk, but he could be.  What he's saying could be delivered with both ways.  Still, if you're confused as to what he's saying, he's your best source for finding out exactly what he means.  Does he dictate other things to you too?  Like what you should/should not wear?  What you should and should not say?  Controlling people exist in a lot more places than we tend to think.<br>  <br>  Also is he always telling you that or is he just mentioning it every now and then?  If it's a common thing he says, he should back off of it.  There's far more to say to a girlfriend than that.  Things like "I like your hair" "those pants look good on you" "lets go see a movie!" "I love you" . . .|`|IUxM3brbaa	no. that's hot|`|F74RfKpoaa	Honey you have a beautiful body i wish i had curves like that you are perfect and if he doesnt like that then why are you still talking to him he should be there for what you are and not what you weigh and you only live once hell if you wanna eat past 12 then eat gurl its your life not his you need to go out and show them curves and find a mind who likes them and can handle them not someone telling you to get rid a part of you im skinny and i hate it i wish i had a body like yours|`|OJJ5EN3Saa	wow your not fat at all|`|xDH6yjiMaa	no your perfect weight hes the one who is under weight so dont let that bother you. your perfect the way you are!! as long as your a good person!! good luck with your bf!|`|TlXLKVEOaa	well you must think your fat if your asking us. and you must be saying stuff to him for him to keep telling you how and when to eat. Guys really don't talk about that stuff unless you ask or talk about it. Well I guess he could like really skinny girls and your gaining to much weight for him in which case I say you lose weight or he will leave you!|`|OIkHzNjOaa	You're BMI is 21.6 which is considered an appropriate weight for your height. If you feel a bit overweight, you could always tone your muscles and start working out. You don't have to do this to lose weight per say, because you're not fat, but to make yourself feel better, you know?|`|AA12253921	i wouldn't worry about it too much, you have big legs and the majority of your weight is coming from<br>  <br>  <br>  your boyfriend has probably noticed that your weight bothers you and he's just trying to help out<br>  <br>  quick ways to lose a little bit of weight, eat breakfast! most girls i know will just skip it and complain about not losing weight, eating breakfast will actually help you lose weight because you'll have the energy to burn fat and carbs; get some exercise in every day, even if its just some squats while watching tv, exercising a little everyday helps your body continuously burn weight, and finally; get a healthy amount of sleep! most of your weight is actually burned while you sleep, its your body's "re-energizing" function that burns the weight while you sleep to give you energy when you wake up! =]<br>  <br>  hope i could help even though i gave extra info!|`|EeLdzTo9aa	if ur comfortable with urself, thats all that matters. ur bf is being a jerk for telling u to not eat and stuff. he should love u no matter wat.  also, 142 is not fat at all. i weigh more than that and you can definitely tell. im working on losing weight for health reasons, and thats the only reason why anyone should lose weight. never try to lose weight for anyone but urself. personally, i dont even think you look 135, so u shouldnt b self concious about it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvJWDMg8E_.vEAqeYfLu4Ivsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090505165702AA5Y0R7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0KXiwjDbaa	Naw!|`|JjS4ARPYaa	There is no way with that body he should be telling you what to eat and when, he is a jerk.

You're not a child, and what's more, you're not HIS child; he has no right to tell you when, what, or how much to eat.  If you let him rule you now, soon he'll be telling you what you can wear, where you're allowed to go, whom you can talk to, etc.  Have some confidence in yourself and respect yourself, and you'll end up with a much better caliber of guy.|`|UIwWghpaaa	Oh no! My boyfriend is the same height as me and about twenty pounds less. Come on! We have butts and boobs that add pounds. I don't suppose he'd want to date you if you were flat chested. <br>  <br>  What really matters is how he is treating you. If he is being kind and trying to help you reach your own goals of eating healthier, than you can be honest and tell him that it hurts your feelings. If he is just saying that because he wants his girlfriend to look like a victoria secret model, than he is jerk and you should dump him.

I can see if u where like 160 pounds but u are very slim.  I dont think he is trying to help. I think he just likes being verbally abusive. sorry|`|CLtNYwFTaa	First off, I think you're very pretty.<br>  Second, You are NEVER too fat to date.<br>  <br>  142 is a very healthy weight for you're age and it's unfair to you that your boyfriend is saying these things. I think, if you are sensitive about your weight, that next time you should tell him that you're a healthy weight. And I know that it isn't my business, but perhaps if we won't respect you for who you are, then it might be time either for a serious talk, or for a well-deserved breakup.<br>  <br>  You are being hypersensitive, but with reason. Your boyfriend is shoving your faults in your face and that is not fair.<br>  <br>  Just remember that you're a beautiful person and your weight shouldn't matter if he truly loves you.<br>  <br>  YOU'RE NOT FAT!|`|uRmObZ9Waa	size doesnt matter, he may just want you to slim down a little bit.<br>  he cares about you but its really just thinking about his own wants.<br>  dont get mad about it, maybe just make an effort, go for walks or something. and dont eat after 12. food processes and turns to fat. that just may be the problem.|`|G8maXDHOaa	perhaps you should be monitoring his eating habbits for a while, see how he likes it, the underlying issue here seems to be that he is insecure just in himself but finds a way to vent his frustration with his own weight issue though you, Perhaps together you should try a new fitness routine, or even question if you should be together at all seeing as you have your self a real life "shallow hal" , you appear to be a very attractive lady, besides, if you feel good, then you look good, just tell your him that he has his own issues to tend with and if he wants to help you, he should start by helping himself,,,,,,,,good luck pretty lady :-)|`|OhgPkug4aa	weights just a number,<br>  and your body is not that bad.|`|PngTMuucaa	First off you aren't fat.  You are a creation of God and he only creates beautiful things.

One only cuts down or quits when they decide to.  I'm sure that there will be some younger guys who are going to have some hot dreams tonight thanks to you.

m4mobIQfaa	Hey. I am a shy girl, and around on the other side of that. I don't know exactly about this girl, but if she's anything like me, then yeah, she does like you. What did you talk about on the bus? Please answer because I'll check back on this question and help you more. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, shy girls tend to want the guy to approach them. I know I do. If she seems nervous around you, that means yes, she does. (nervous = stuttering, quietness, apprehensiveness, reluctantness)|`|kUEujZAQaa	It depends. If she smiles when she talks to you then she does. Try to talk to her as often as you can and eventually she will warm up to you and it will be easy to tell. She seems a little insecure so try to comfort her when shes talking to you. Flirt with her, but don't over do it or try to look like a cool guy. Its kinda stupid. be modest.|`|x4V65m30aa	honestly, she might be shy because she doesnt know how to say "i dont like you". im sure she doesnt dislike you, but its hard for some people to come out straighforward and say "i dont like you like that". she is probably being shy because she knows you still like her, and she finds it awkward.<br>  <br>  although, i dont know either of you. there is still hope, so good luck ;D|`|SQQDY9kWaa	hey srry id have to say she doesnt like u.  just think though mayb she not the girl u want or mayb u might get a better girl that likes u.  idk<br>  but plz check out my band the song name is opportunity and its kinda the same topic of what ur going through<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP6m-2PAQVw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP6m-2PAQ...</a>|`|KJ9fZDNsaa	She doesn't know what to do about the ackwardness of your accusation.<br>  <br>  Inter-racial Relationships question ...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090427194921AAxubIT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  .<br>  .|`|o2g7HIxiaa	Let it go.

Stop talking to her and move on.|`|EReJvjFOaa	i don't know why you're asking. she said she didn't. you just freaked her out. that's why she's so damn shy.|`|b70cNqyqaa	The best thing for you to do, is continue being friendly towards her, like, wave and smile, from afar. But do not engage in conversation again until she comes to YOU to have one. that is out of respect for her space and her telling you she does not want you for a boyfriend. That is a very respectful way to handle this. We all like certain people a lot, but they don't always like us back, a lot. The only thing you and I can do is have and give them respect. When she comes to talk to you, be a friend.
DL7ARbujaa	Probably not, parties like that people usually don't bring presents. Have you watched "my super sweet 16" you never see people carrying presents in... who knows!
7YTiooX5aa	Well he probably does but as you are his best friend he is probably hoping that you will respect her and treat her well, I am sure if you hurt her then your friendship may not survive it.

fMEypXDYaa	What part of 'In sickness and health, good times or bad times' did you not get? You either need to support him, or leave him and move on with your life. Neither of you are putting any effort into the marriage,  both of you need to work things out of call it quits, you can get a marriage annulled within one year of getting married, maybe you two ought to consider that.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Faith makes a good point.  He didn't live by his vows, and you're about to do the same.<br>  <br>  Ya, I think you should walk.  And I also think you should never marry again because you don't pick good partners.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	Didn't you take your marriage vows seriously - "For better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and health, till death do us apart."<br>  <br>  Now seriously you shouldn't be complaining so much and now retracking his past mistake especially if you gave him a chance. I am thinking that you giving him a chance and further marrying him would make you look at wanting to be together through thick and thin, trying to get through the obstacles that are presented in your life and not throwing past actions back into the future.<br>  <br>  You bringing up his past mistake is not excusable as you decided to go further ahead with him in having a life long commitment. I know you are affected by all of this. But you have to understand that men express their emotions differently to women. Women talk out their problems or confide in their friends. Men however drown their sorrows in the minds...well most men do and they rely on strategies in their mind to help them get through it. I know drinking on his part may hurt you. Be instead of moaning trying to be at least supportive and let him know you are there because he is having it hard.<br>  <br>  However if you can't deal with..then adding more pain on his part i guess it seems you have chosen divorce as the answer to your solution. But you bringing up his past after accepting him by giving things ago in your relationship, then moaning after areas that are of reminder of this is truly not excusable.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Personally, i would not have rekindled the relationship or married him. Simply because with children outside of the relationship there is going to be drama, "such as you explain" not the child's fault, however I would not and will not deal with it. Life is hard enough, and now he is behind in child support and must get caught up and this is going to cause quite the strain in your relationship. You have two choices, leave and don't look back or simply deal with it. Good luck.

u2ai704vaa	first of all.... i'm gay, and don't have an STD! Surprise! Just because someone is gay doesn't mean that they have an STD. however, if he is posting ads online that he is wanting to rim a stranger that he doesn't even know, then yeah, he might have one. but, you would get that from kissing him or anything. second of all, i doubt you have HIV. If he just stuck it in once and pulled it out, i doubt there was anything transferred. you're more likely to get H.I.V. from frenching him. Get tested and dump him. If he's looking for a real realtionship, send him my way! lol|`|RlzkeY0gaa	Straight guys have sexually transmitted diseases and infections too.

First of all, if he penetrated you with his penis, that is sex. End of story. You're not Bill Clinton here. Penetration=sex.<br>  <br>  2. You're clearly misinformed about homosexuality and STDs. First of all, you should ALWAYS use protection unless you and your partner have been tested and are monogamous. Plenty of straight people have STDs such as HIV, herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea, and more. Just because you're gay doesn't mean you've got an STD. And just because you're straight doesn't mean you automatically don't have an STD. Educate yourself!<br>  <br>  3. Let him go. If he's gay, and that's all there is to it. He might be afraid to live a fully open gay lifestyle, but he's gay. Tell him what you found, tell him you just want him to be happy, and that you know that's not you. Then forget about him. You can't turn him straight. You also might want to ask him if he is bisexual rather than simply gay. Even if he is bisexual, he wasn't honest with you, he hid it, and he was trying to cheat on you with men, so I would still leave him.|`|AA10248966	tell him you need time to think now that you have discovered he swings both ways.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Well i dont think he gave u anything, plus he might be protecting himself when doing it to someone his same sex, anyway, GOD and church does not have to do anything with whom he is now, this is something and that is something else, go and do the test and stop thinking bout it more than that, and sure not all men r the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	get him to take you to a hospital.. and pay for a std test .. that will fix him.. but as for being a friend i dont think so as friends dont do that to each other .. ..|`|AA12385489	Cool down.

A few weeks later, she saw me in the streets with my Mercedes SLK ( which had bought at a cheap price at an auction in Germany)...And how amazing, I noticed that she began to come more often to the gym club, working at the machines very close to me ( before that, she was rather avoiding me )...She was trying to talk to me, with some ridiculous pick up lines,I noticed the change on her attitude...And I was pissed off, of course...<br>  <br>  They are gold-diggers...They just see the wallet, not the guy...<br>  <br>  For instance, I had a friend that had a Porsche Carrera...He was ugly like hell, but he was very popular with girls..Girls know that the mere monthly insurance expanse for such a car is above 1000 Euros/month, not to mention the huge gas costs...So they think " if he can pay that, then he can pay my bills and offer me a lot of things"...<br>  YUUUK!<br>  <br>  Thanks God, all women are not like that...|`|avhgLEu8aa	The car has nothing to do with what the owner is like.<br>  Numptys can own good cars, good guys can own beaten up rust buckets.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Not really.<br>  I mean, my husband had a sports car (the very one I dreamed of for me) when we met..<br>  I see a nice car, I drool.

I'm the girl for you!!  J/K (kind of).  Yes, I do judge a man by the kind of car he drives, because I think his reasons for choosing the car he does say a great deal about him.<br>  <br>  For example, I know that my boy-friend likes to drive a stick.  This is his dominant personality, and it appeals to me.  But his car is not a sports car--it's a 4 door Toyota, and not a Camry, he didn't have to have top of the line.  He bought it to pass to his teenaged son in 2 years.  So, he demonstrated good fathering, foresight and practicality.  Good money skills.<br>  <br>  I drive a Subaru Forester, btw.  It's getting old.  I'll drive it out and if it lasts that long, my son wants to drive it. (oh, honey, I DO have to have top of the line--I thought we were talking about men.  lol  Actually, Outback is top of the line, so I'm still okay here lol)<br>  <br>  Oh, I plan to be sitting in the back seat kicking his seat like he did until he got old enough to ride up front.  lol<br>  <br>  Edit:  There's another thing we do about car analogies and men, but um let's just say the more expensive the car the smaller the ........ .|`|WewCtMpzaa	Nice cars are one thing, but once you pull into exotic and high end sports cars, you make yourself a target for far more than women with another agenda beside real love. Besides the fact that these kinds of cars are jacked the most, other people who see you will want to either see if they can take advantage of you, or at least mess you up by calling the IRS on you, or making your life difficult. <br>  <br>  Many people detest people with wealth. They despise that they do not have the same, and they will either go on the hunt, or try to destroy you just so you lose that fancy car.<br>  <br>  Most of the richest people drive older, more realistic cars. Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart drove a small toyota truck most of his time at Wal-Mart (besides owning a small fleet of planes). <br>  <br>  People who really have money, like the stuff that makes dreams come true go above and beyond to make sure they don't look like they do, and if they play around with fancy stuff, they tell everyone they are in debt above their eyeballs.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	Some women do...but it depends what they look for in a guy.

Driving a fancy car doesn't necessarily mean you've got a successful career and make alot money.

Judging or choosing a man by the car he drives is like choosing  a man by the suit he wears.   Its the inside what counts, but how well he keeps his car and his suits is what tells about the true person.    I remember my experience with this guy who drove a Mercedes and he picked me up on our first (and only) date.  He was a very successful business owner and I was thrilled that he asked me out.   Turned out the car was messy and dirty inside with musky smell, he was a total jerk, in love with himself and his car, a total turned off.   On the other hand, months later, I started dating this computer technician who drove a 5 year old Chevy, but what a difference.   The car was spotless, smelled like the cologne he was wearing, he was a total gentleman and I was his focus of attention, not his money, nor his car.|`|2HznXhPcaa	yes i do believe that a lot of women do judge a man of what he has and the car he drives. because i dont drive and women call me a loser     sweet mildred sent me here to help you out.

Q01sPUInaa	Tell your friends that you respect their opinions,but you are not leaving on because of their advice. You have your own life to live! Do not let your friends live it for you!!!<br>  Walter C.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Tell them that you have no intention of leaving him, no matter what they say.  And the more they say it, the more you ignore them, so they may as well stop.  Point out to them that their "advice" is driving a wedge between your friendship more than your relationship.|`|QeInCI4Raa	just tell them its your decision<br>  and you can decide on who is right for you<br>  tell them you appreciate their caring for you<br>  but you have to do it on your own|`|uRbeSOMwaa	If he treats you right, and doesn't force you to do anything stupid. then i dont see a big deal.<br>  just stay away from the drinking/smoking stuff|`|V9IEOKt8aa	what kinda friends do you have. just ignore them.|`|Vp4np23Qaa	Your friends aren't trying to be annoying. They are trying to get across the point that they are concerned. They probably think he is a bad influence, but then, they don't know him as well as you probably do. As long as you are acting like yourself and you don't do drugs or smoke and he doesn't either then it should be okay. If you want them to get to know him better, invite your friends to hang out with you guys so they can see what he is like. Just keep your options open. Maybe you are right, but try to look at something that they wouldn't like about him and understand why. Maybe you are right, but they could be too.<br>  **But also, don't try to please your friends because your life is your life and they can't tell you what to do.|`|JM9DF3nEaa	do what you think is best and if your friends dont respect that then i dont know|`|EKDnnFupaa	Tell your friends the following:<br>  LOLOLOL LOSTNCONTACT LIKES TO LICK DA BOYS|`|GprW2fmZaa	Tell them their advice isn't worth a picture of a whale and a dolphin gettin' it onnn|`|qXV0TjWEaa	Okay well if he DOESNT smoke and drink its all good.<br>  BUT if he DOES. dump his ***!|`|vJwRrFwIaa	ME TOO!  be like .... guys i really like this boy and he likes me. thanks for the advice but my life my desision if it doesnt work ill pay for it not you|`|28667a2fab4e406f52bfe94a34c859cbaa	Tell you friends...

However, when you are a bit older you will find that boys/men are rarely attracted to a particular hair colour but to the individual beneath the hair. Just be yourself and let nature take it's course.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Are you truly ginger or just a shade of red - strawberry blonde, auburn, etc. True ginger ginger is quite rare. There is a tendency for people to say ginger when they mean red.<br>  <br>  Embrace your red hair - I have red hair (going grey now sigh!) it's great. <br>   Red is a colour of passion, vibrancy and personality - enjoy it, and don't worry about boyfriends  - if you are confident in who you are, then that is more attractive than anything else to a boy (the decent ones at least!!)<br>  <br>  Viva red hair I say!<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|AA11066099	I hope it isn't the same in other schools!x|`|JNY4BEASaa	i dont know any gingers lol sorry|`|M6PsYn56aa	Yep until we all dyed our hair dark brown!|`|ZMAOR0A9aa	all this talk about gingers not being able to get a boyfriend is **** tbh, i have 2 ginger haired friends (who are naturally ginger) and are both really pretty or average as you say and they have had boyfriendS before- one is actually with someone atm. so i dont get why people say gingers are ugly or can't a boyfriend, the right guy will come along someday just wait it out.|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	I don't think it's because you're ginger that you can't get dates...it could just be a coincidence. Or you just haven't found the right person to go out with yet. Also...you shouldn't go out on a date JUST because everyone else has, you're only 13...so I doubt everyone has! Enjoy being young while you can - cus relationships can complicate things sometimes, trust me!<br>  <br>  Also...being ginger/having red hair is nothing to feel bad about. I'm pretty sure redheads are rarer than say blondes or brunettes - so if anything, I'd be proud of your hair colour! :D Plus, if a guy is worth it...he'd like you for who you are, not just what your hair colour is. I even know a guy who has a bit of a fetish for red hair...so there are guys out there who love it! :)|`|TgPGzOsPaa	trust me coming from a redhead myself by the time ur 15 boys will start to notice u. i use to think the way you did at one point but ive always had boys like me. what u gotta do is stop thinking about ur hair colour and such and just be you ul will be notied soon enough.<br>  <br>  much luv and power to the redheads lol|`|JrcmZzdLaa	HAIR DOES NOT DEFINE WHO YOU ARE! maybe your not trying hard enough, maybe your not ready! give it some time! the moment will come=)|`|lxBRDcZKaa	Only For Natural Gingers<br>  <br>  *Flicks My Hair* :]|`|PdfMNeqqaa	I have a friend who is ginger and every guy wants to get with her so i wouldn't worry about it :)|`|AA11376151	just dye your hair and see what happens

yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, the first thing is, their is nothing wrong with you ok!  You are just as special, just as important as anybody else, you need to remember that!<br>  Talk to your Mum, when you are both relaxed, not in a rush to go anywhere, say" We both get stressed out, but surely we can try and be pleasant with each other, I know I get stressed out with my course and you must get stressed out working and looking after a home, can we not find some common ground"?  As for your boyfriend he could be a bit more tactful surely?  Why not ask him when you are both chilled out " Hey, I guess you will look at naked girls, but when you know I'm coming round can't you take em down, I'm not too keen on seeing them"  If he refuses then you need to consider what's important to you.  A little bit of respect from your boyfriend or getting wound up everytime you see him.<br>  Have a night out with girlfriends, change your hairstyle, my guess is your boyfriend will start to take notice, if not other guys will!<br>  Hope this helps. Don't forget nothing wrong with you, you are normal!<br>  <br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|fS5UkvkGaa	I went through exactly the same thing once, but obviously the girl I was going out with wasn't looking at naked pictures of girls. She was cheating on me.<br>  <br>  For a while I found that physical pain (Ie, cutting yourself) was better than emotional pain. But I dumped my girlfriend, talked with my mum prayed and confided in some close friends and slowly I got back on track. If you are really bad I advise seeing your school counsellor as soon as possible and try to keep positive. Also try listening to a different style of music. I don't know if you listen to my kind of alternative/emo music but if you do I would advise listening to something uplifting and about carrying on. If not... then listen to something uplifting and about carrying on anyway!|`|MRxm67DPaa	hun relax...ok even though it seems like everyones agianst u theres always gonna be that one person that will always love u and thats god and jesus theyll never let u down and u know wat i think ur a really strong grul for putten up with all this and i think u have every right to get mad at ur man hes a jerk but dont let his issues get u down just think positive and belive that gods there to make ur life easier becuase unlike other ppl he cares and dosent judge u and im here for u if u ever feel like this again and gods there to i recommend u pray and tell him to please make ur life a little easier and ima pray for u to even if i dont know u ima ask god to make sure all the stress goes away and that u can be happy agian cuz he actually listens and care about u.|`|lWGaYxAbaa	GET HELP TALK 2 YOUR COUNCILOR!!i had that same problem it will go away Talk 2 ur mom see whats wrong....and ...umm....well sry but if ur boyfriend has pics of naked girls on his wall i would break up with him  U ARE GOOD ENOUGH U DESERVE BETTER THAN HIM!!!!!!!|`|k2eff7i8aa	Focus on God, pray for your boyfriend, pray for your mom, and never give up.

Ask Mom whats up. and if your boy friend likes having these pictures then tell him your not coming back into his room because your not happy with it. If he has a problem with that he will take them down. Or you will stay away. I know when your in love you have to give and take but you do not have to be used. There is not enough room in your life for all this stress so talk to mom and ask her why she hates you. She may not even realizes she is hurting you. He can change walls or girls.|`|oRrp6Tryaa	no... getting naked or some sort of things like this doesnt make anyone so cool and it will take away the true love from them too... remember ... if you truly want to fall in a deep love , you should push the hot and horny stuff away ... and about your boyfriend ... break up with him , he's not a good person because he doesnt want you for love and its obious so i suggest you to do it ...noooooo you are a very good person and dont ever feel like you are a bad girl just because you dont show yourself naked or something like that... dont take it too hard and try to be normal and if its the way it is always think about your self and forget about everyone because thinking about it will make you sad and mad so dont worry be happy...* always know your own value * good luck ........

I<br>  am here if you want to talk.|`|CQA4HAdmaa	I would not give up hope.  I have always been an optimist.  As you get older, people mature an understand, without relationships, their is no real meaning to life. Suicide is something you should bring up to authorities because it can be treated.  Even if it means losing that friendship by telling others, you are saving a life because you care. <br>  <br>  You seem like a very bright and intelligent person.  The best friendships take time to nurture.  The fact you are even asking this question now in your life puts you well ahead of most and your journey through life will be very rewarding for you.<br>  <br>  Understand there are people who move, will need to relocate because of their jobs in the future and travel.  Through it all,your acceptance of people as they are with no preconditions is the first step in offering friendships that will last.  Enjoying people for just being themselves and appreciating their uniqueness is a wonderful quality that can engender trust and friendship.<br>  <br>  If you are in school, a quick way to get lots of friends is joining sports or extracurricular activities.<br>  <br>  You are well on your way to having lots of friends-do not worry.|`|kAlDPBz7aa	I feel that way too actually.

I'm sure there are loads of nice things about him that make you very happy, but basically he's making you sad in quite a few areas so yes, I think you should leave him.  He won't like that either and will probably show you his true colours when he tries to get you back under his thumb but that will just make it easier for you to leave.  He's had his chance hasn't he and has blown it.|`|qgpXxcuGaa	If you haven't talked to him about this already, do so.

jXCjw64Iaa	If it is really a mutual relationship then she will come around. you guys will go through phases where someone is a little more interested than the other....thats how every relationship is...someone always has to like the other more in the beginning. Be patient. Don't start doing more than you already are...don't smother her. Keep being good to her, making her feel special. She has friends too that she may have an equally important relationship with in a different way. Eventually she will be on the same page as you IF there is something that can get serious between you guys.
TzfupeX1aa	Well you cant do much because you didn't know the members of her family. But tell her no matter what that your going to be there by her side, and whenever she needs you to call you. Tell her she can come to you whenever shes ready to talk. Take her out for walks ride bike do some arts and crafts maybe a funny movie. <br>  Unfortunately she will be reminded of the people she lost when shes home but remind her that their are people around her who will make her feel better and enjoy life and not dwell on the unfortunate event that are passing in her life.<br>  Hope that helps some.|`|QVjagGXPaa	Hug her, take her to your house and watch comedy movies, do something fun. <br>  Listen when she wants to talk about it, don't prod when she doesn't. Tell her that you'll be here to listen, but you won't ask questions because it is her business.
mVJVUxSzaa	At this point in your life with a 2 year old daughter and going to school, it sounds like you could really do without a husband who does not seem to support you as a wife and mother. You can do, be, and feel bad all by yourself. Your daughters strengths will come from you so it is probably not a good idea to let grow up  around a bunch of people who totally disrespects you.<br>  I think you should leave your current situation, yes your marriage and concentrate on your daughter and the both of your futures.|`|Pstmrurfaa	Thats so sad you deserve better than that, I would say maybe try move move, and the family always may talk but act like you don't care. My family is the same way, and i have NOTTING to do with them. It hurts me but i learn to deal with it.|`|LlfLa4Twaa	You shouldn't have married an Iranian.

I feel your pain. i hate reading about someone so much in pain and so confused. I wish I could help you. I want to reach out and give you a hug. It's terrible that you can't even trust your family to have your back. They should love you not matter what.<br>  <br>  Here is a peice of advice that is harder to accomplish than it sounds; Surround yourself with positive people. Surround yourself with people that make you feel good about you! There is a lesson you should learn here. don't know what it is...but if you think about it...I bet you're smart enough to figure it out. ;-) <br>  <br>  it hurts but illiminate the people in your life that hurt you. It's hard but it's someting you must do to be happy.<br>  <br>  I am sorry sweetie. Hope it works out.|`|oWAUb6vpaa	You husband has no respect for you and if I were you, I'd divorce asap. Maybe I should tell you to at least try marriage counseling first... <br>  <br>  Anyway, that's a horrible story and I feel sorry for you. Your spouse shouldn't be talking to anyone that nothing nice to say about you. Thta's very wrong on his part as your partner and the person who's supposed to love you. <br>  I know how it feels to have family member(s) talk bad about you especially when what they're saying isn't true - it makes it all feel a lot worse. <br>  I don;t know anything about your culture - but I do know this is America and we're living in the 21st century. WOman have rights here and no matter where you're from or who you are, doesn;t make you any less deserving of having respect from those closest to you, especially from your husband. <br>  Talk about manipulation: your huisband is allowing those people to manipulate him - how weak is he for that one! He's bringing in all this misery into your home when those things should really be the last things on his mind. No matter if you had a "bad" past or not, some people do change and everyone should be entitle to respect until you show that you're undeserving of it.. today, not 5 years ago, etc.. and your husband is not a good husband and he's proven to be undeserving of your respect and love. He's a horrible person to have made you feel this way and then to bring your motherhood into - big no-no! <br>  I would be afraid I were you and I would begin looking into your rights as a wife and mother so that you can protect yourself in the event that this jerk spouse of yours attempts to destroy your life and take your daughter with him. <br>  <br>  I feel really sorry for you and wish I could be a better help to you.<br>  If you need someone to talk to, you can contact me email at e3579m@yahoo.com - between me and you.. <br>  <br>  Good luck, luv - lots of luck to you and your little girl...**|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Jessica,<br>  If you're so freakin' perfect and wonderful, how do you have enemies? <br>  <br>  Either way, you have two choices.  Stay married and continue to be treated badly, or end your marriage and take control of your life.|`|AA11785285	I guess we revolved in a different circle... we don't have any enemies.  If we meet someone we don't like, we don't socialize with them.... simple.<br>  <br>  And the Middle East:  Another planet to Americans and Europeans.  Women can't even wear make-up in Iran, and in some places, can't even go out of their house unless accompanied by a male, even if that male is their 6 your old little boy.<br>  <br>  Absolutely ridiculous.|`|uuHDQr1paa	Let me first say...I do not have enemies. My approval rating has skyrocketed in recent days.  I have the support and love of the majority of Americans regardless of income levels or political affiliations.  A new era has begun and I fully intend to lead us out of the darkness and into the light of a new generation where all Americans prosper.  As to your current situation with your husband, I think a trial separation would be advisable.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	If your husband doesn't support you, I'm sorry but it's time to separate. A spouse is suppose to be the closest person to you, and he is suppose to defend you when all these people talk negative stuff about you, not to be a pact against you. Maybe it's time to pack up, and go. You have a lot of support from friends, and I'm sure they'll help you whenever you need them.|`|Fn6vayT4aa	no ffense i am not raciest but most iranians act like that toward women and i am sorry to hear that i really am and i hope things get better for you hun|`|661f39420372e21b090f02f05da73dfaaa	If you husband does not support you it's time for a divorce.|`|AA11370698	Sounds like this is racist?  you middle eastern people don't reason 21st century, your in 1000 of years ago mentality.<br>  My advice escape or they may kill you and your baby or both.-----Find a safe house. abuse like your takeing is deadly.|`|AA11758925	Different lifestyle from that direction of the world. scary. your in a ruff situation.

It's time you talked with everyone and let them know where you stand as well as where they stand. I'm sorry you have to go thru this but I'm sure if you keep the focus on being good to yourself and being good to your child and what that entails you'll find your way thru this all. And don't let a grudge with family be what limits you, that anger you have is going to have to be dealt with sooner or later or it will eat into another part of your life if it hasnt already. Stop calling them enemies. You might have disagreements plenty of them but they are your family and your child will be influenced either by the love you show toward them or the reproach. Make amends in some way. Not saying you have to listen to them ridicule you and all of that but you need to make peace in some fashion rather than letting them shut you out or you shutting them out. Don't let an emotion like pride or anger stand in your way of being the best person you can be. Peace.|`|Z4PxfObXaa	I don't know you personally, but here is my opinion.<br>  I think you should have a serious talk with your husband.<br>  If you are the opposite of what your family thinks of you, then he has NO right to tell you all of those negative things.<br>  If he is your husband, he must love and support you.<br>  He must back you up and stand up for you, not put you down.<br>  See a marriage counselor and get all of your feelings out.<br>  As far as the rest of your family goes--it's not a huge loss that you no longer speak to them; we don't talk to our extended family either.|`|ZxYxB9jCaa	Hello.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry to hear this...but remember, in life we cannot always be treated fairly…life isn’t supposed to be easy...sometimes we feel as though the whole world is against us, but all we can do is be ourselves, and know who we TRULY are...if they cannot see who we really are, no matter how hard we try to show them and if they cannot treat us like the good caring human beings we are, then we can't force them…all we can do is stay strong, confident, and positive, the truth will always reveal itself, whether it takes a long time or a short amount of time, one day everyone's true personalities will be revealed...you should just focus on your goals, your child, etc....BE STRONG and CONTENT with the person you are…as long as you know who you are, that is all that counts...and remember, try to do the best you can...making mistakes is part of being human, if you feel as though you may have done something to hurt their feelings, then just apologize…whether they accept your apology or not does not matter…as long as you are making personal improvements, that’s all that counts…you can’t control how they feel about you, but you can control the person you ARE.  DON'T trash talk anyone, etc., no matter what they say about you, it just makes situations worse...just be a GOOD person, and they will all come back to you.  You sound like a really nice person, and I honestly hope that everything works out for you.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes.

You haven't mentioned how long you've been together but if you know it's true love and stable then go for it. <br>  <br>  You're still young enough to pursue other goals and time to reflect on relationships along the way. Just don't settle for anything less than what you deserve from anyone. Take time for yourself and enjoy your alone time while you still have your own place. A lot of things change when you move in with someone and how you share everything. Think about those things and don't be afraid to ask him what he's offering by moving in together. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck in what you choose.

Turn the tables-- go to parties and stuff without them, don't hang out with them for a while, try to fill your schedule with activities and act really really happy when you're around them.

CZAjVF7Zaa	Well, if you make a move on  your guy friend, you could risk losing not only his friendship, but also your other best friend.  It might be hard, but in my opinion I don't think it's worth it.  Give it time - try to spend time with each of them separately, and change the subject if one starts talking about the other.  Make a point of looking at other guys, it might be tough but try to keep yourself busy and stop thinking about him.  I know from personal experience that this situation sucks beyond belief, but keep your chin up and eventually your feelings should start to fade.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and good luck with whatever you decide to do.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	That's what's called a Love Triangle. The thing is, is that you should tell him how you feel. No matter how embarrassed you are about doing this, it is the best idea. Tell your other best friend (the female) how you feel as well. Then, it won't feel as weird to be around them. It is like me. I like on guy, but I love another. But, now I am having dreams about the new guy and don't know what to do.

I'd separate from them until you can get free of the love bug.  Being around the best guy friend will just hurt you.  Separating will get you insight and maturity.

LEt them carry on with their lives and just make sure you're there to comfort them both if they break up (that is, if they go out in the first place). But make sure you don't get into a relationship with the guy because he'll just be on rebound - wait a couple of months and just be friendly then maybe it'll develop from there. Planning ahead...I know..but hey! :)|`|AA11662588	wow, your in a pickle. my advice to you is to move on! He's in love with your best friend. How would she feel if she knew you were plotting on her  beau? The last thing you'll want is to lose your closest friends. It'll be easy to find another guy, and believe me you will, but true friends are extremely hard to find.<br>  Good luck. you'll be fine.|`|MLjagYw3aa	Ok, <br>  <br>  so you need to work out do you want your best friends to be happy together - and if so would u be able to put up with them together or will it hurt.

Seeing two people in love and seeing them together like that sometimes makes us lust for that and because you are best friends with him he obviously has things that you like about him but tread very carefully on this line...you could end up losing both of them. If it's something you feel really strongly about then you have to decide if you have to pursue it or leave it alone. Tricky thing this...we often lust after what we can't have|`|lG7Mi4lraa	It's a rough situation because you don't want to interfere with your relationship as friends with either of them.

eGiLYNlzaa	I have the same problem...But i've been told that a guy will look at you a lot and when you're talking to him he'll either be really nice and listen to everything you say or be rude and pretend to ignore you. If you two are ever alone it's kinda awkward but you have small talk until someone else joins you...Sorry if i didn't help, as i said i have my own problem! My crush told me i was the only cool girl in our school and that he would totally date me, except i wasn't his type. I don't know if he said i wasn't his type because our other friends were around, or what? Boys are so confusing...|`|s3v3COq2aa	You will know... trust me.. you will know.
fBso80Ubaa	This isn't meant as a truth question, just a security question.  So put the name of whoever you hung out with last.  If you have a dog, put its name down (a dog is, after all, a man's best friend).
fBso80Ubaa	Since you two already made out, it's already very clear that she likes you.  Remember: guys will typically make out with any girl who shows interest in them, but girls will make out *only* with guys they're attracted to (or in nightclubs with their friends, but that's not the point).  So there is no real need to get worked up over a special way to ask her out.  Just invite her for coffee or ice cream with you after school.  Sit in the quiet part of the dining area.  Then ask her while you two are sitting together.|`|HIO0yvK0aa	(girl's name) would you like to go to prom with me?<br>  <br>  it's simple.|`|xxvLfLrYaa	Send her flowers and a card to her house<br>  or on a cute cake|`|y2O1D8q7aa	Okay this was one of the cutest things a guy did to me, when he asked me to homecoming. <br>  <br>  <br>  At the end of the school day, he got a whole bunch of his friends and put on white shirts that spelled out<br>  <br>  Will you go to home coming with <br>  <br>  And then he jumps out from behind and says "ME"!<br>  <br>  I thought it was SUPER cute and he had a red rose in his hand and of cource i said yes(:|`|f7MDCw5raa	dude, <br>  you got to be romantic tell he what she wants to hear. give her some sort of gift and makeout.<br>  <br>  thats all i got for ya,|`|manCQ4Lkaa	Stay cool.<br>  <br>  Be straight forward. dont ask her in front of a crowd.<br>  <br>  wear deodrant<br>  <br>  wear normal clothes<br>  <br>  keep ur hair good.<br>  <br>  Smile<br>  <br>  be straight forward<br>  <br>  dont get nervous. its NO BIG DEAL if she turns u down!<br>  <br>  ask her OUT!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK :)hope i helped|`|VP2T5LeHaa	5 cupcakes.<br>  <br>  P R O M ?<br>  <br>  on each.|`|8974ab84bf2fb9e7ec31bc60afebc1bbaa	Be kind to her.

If you try to cut him off from money he will only get in worst trouble trying to get some.|`|AA11265589	You can contact Gamblers Anonymous .  Accept the fact that your loved one has an addiction.  He will continue to lie to get money to feed his habit.  One bet is too many and one thousand is not enough.  Try an intervention with the family or friends.  He will not stop until he is ready.  And all of you must be enablers since you made no mention od anyone telling him that they will not loan him money.

Q7ALl9zeaa	I have always thought that when you are cheating with someone, eventually they will be cheating on you. She didnt respect the man she was with, she cheated on him with you. It sounds like a disfunctional relationship, but it doesn't have to carry on and take up the rest of your life. having a baby is something both people should agree on, was she trying to trap you? Maybe if she had do it on her own, she would appreciate what she had, like her real husband, the one she cheated on. Do not let her or the situation to make you feel like a victim...make a plan and change things. It can be an uplifting experience, to free yourself from a bad relationship. Learn from it.|`|wzqahEqiaa	Why did you have an affair?  You shouldn't have interfered in her marriage and you wouldn't have these problems.  Affairs are disrespectful and it's hard to bring respect back into a relationship when people are dishonest from the beginning.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Wow. Seems the two of you weren't meant to be. Sorry to say but you guys have alot of issues along with the fact it started as cheating or a secret relationship whatever you would like to call it. If you really want to make it work you should look into some couples counseling but I doubt it will help. Also hormones are a nightmare so you may want to think about its only going to get worst though menopause.|`|djUMvICoaa	Yeah, in trying to make it work.  She's a gold digger and out to fill her pockets, she's torn your self esteem down and now you can't even wipe your own nose anymore.

Why did you do those things, not why did she make you. Unless she physically made you do those things then there may be some type of "self" issue. Self-esteem etc... <br>  I think you should LET HER GO! Before you know shat happened, you will have wasted 2, 3, even 5 years of your life just to be back in the dating scene again. THERE IS A CLOSE TO PERFECT AS YOU'RE GOING TO GET PERSON OUT HERE FOR EVERYONE. We need to first evaluate our own self-worth and realize that everything that looks good to us isn't always what is best for us.
BKr3y30maa	It sounds like he cares about you and loves you....but only as a friend.  You can't make him change his mind, you just have to accept it and move on.  Continue to be friends with him and try dating someone else.  In time it will get easier.|`|Qxexz4mEaa	Maybe you need to tell him all of what you just wrote. And if he's your close friend now, maybe he'll reconsider. Or ask him for advice about "a guy you really like" or something...hope I've helped a little. =)|`|kBCCwkA3aa	I just have one question...What is stopping you and him from being in a relationship all this time if y ou are crazy about each other?
ibeVcQyWaa	If you're a mature adult with a job to pay for the baby that will inevitably come your way, then do it.  If you are NONE of those, keep your legs closed until you are.  At least, I'm assuming you're talking about sex.  If you're talking about taking the dog for a walk, then by all means, walk away.|`|BOuPi3wDaa	If your talking about sex, I don't think "kinda" wanting to is enough.  Only you know if you're really ready for it, but I personally believe when someone is ready to have sex, they really know it.  I think if you have any doubt at all it's probably not the right time.  When the time is right it will just come natural and you won't really have to think about it.  That's just what I think.  If you know for sure it's what you want, go for it.  If you're not sure, wait.  You'll never regret waiting, but you might regret having sex.|`|EaZHm58eaa	not to politely, say no,the ball's now in his court.[ah,pardon the pun]

There is a name for the disorder, but I'm not sure what it is.  It's also a way to get attention.  Get him some professional help or at least consult a prefessional about your concerns and see what they say.

Why don't you speak to his doctor and find out the facts and see if these surgeries are necessary.  It sounds like a sad marriage if you have to use the phrase "enemy lines".  If this marriage is this bad off, why are you still in it.  Maybe you enjoy this type of life style.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	What a genius!  He's slowly being rebuilt, from the inside out, at a secret location.
ivejg4whaa	It sounds like your boyfriend is immature and incapable of having an adult relationship.<br>  He shouldn't be making you worry about him regardless of the argument you got into.<br>  And dating someone on drugs is a bad idea all around. It will only drag you down and make your life more complicated.<br>  Who needs more stress?<br>  I'd tell him to call you when he's ready to be a man and not a weak little boy.|`|AA11136246	Why would you waste your time with a guy that does not deserve you affection?  If you think that he is really worth it, go and be a martyr.

No offense but you deserve better than that....|`|4IwTGwpyaa	Marry him and out-rank his dad. Seems like the parents are in control here.

But that's just me.|`|0AYPgUQIaa	Third option: what if you would find someone else who appreciates you more and not a drug addict? Just a thought.
AP2e90cCaa	First, take a deep breath.<br>  <br>  Remember when you were a kid? You said all sorts of things to get under someone's skin. Maybe this little girl likes your son and is trying to get his attention? If your husband works at the school, maybe the little girl saw him talking to a woman or something as innocent as that and misinterpreted it. <br>  <br>  Secondly, follow your intuition. Obviously you're worried that something isn't right. If a child told me that my husband was cheating on me I wouldn't take it seriously for a second. Why? Because I trust my husband. That's why I married him. It's clear that you don't share the same security, however, so follow your gut.<br>  <br>  And last, but certainly most importantly, ask your husband! Be light and honest - don't accuse based on what a 9 year old said.<br>  <br>  Be strong woman! Best of luck :)|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	I don't know what "dh" is, but I assume this is your husband.<br>  <br>  Ask him.  Why would a 9 year old say something like that?|`|qVL5R8nuaa	You need to confront your husband with the information. See how he reacts. There is obvviously something else in the marriage that is making you think that it is plausible. Follow your intuition but don't go jumping to conclusions.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I'd mention it to my husband.  Like, oh Johnny said the strangest thing...and lay it on him.  See what his reaction is and go from there...the whole things smells funny that's for sure...Good luck!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	He's probably having an affair with the girls mother. Hunt around and find evidence.|`|5WDsdDQ6aa	It seems pretty complex for a 9 yr. old to make something like that up, so it's probably some truth to the situation.|`|vyNlyfczaa	you need to find out the truth... ask you husband - but ASK don't accuse... be careful and watch your husband (what he does, if he gets home on time etc)<br>  Remember kids say something what they hear or are just mean.<br>  People talk, lie and kids repeat! When you are going to accuse your husband only by this what you son said you may loose more!<br>  I used to lived in NC... my friend moved in with me... we were roomates... we worked together... after like month I started hearing gossips that we are lesbians!!! <br>  People talk because they are bored, mad with their life's, jealous etc and kids are kids they repeat what they hear:D<br>  Good luck and hope this is all lie!

Maybe he changed,all his plans around so he could hangout with you the day you were supposed to come up, and then when you didn't, he got really upset. Perhaps you really did pick the wrong day to be late, he probably had plans. You gotta see why hes upset, but your right, he is a jerk for the way hes treating you now.

ina2jZ5Saa	Guys like virgins, period. he likes the fact that you haven't slept around with everyone, and that your still pure. He probably is being extra nice to you, because he wants to be the one to take it from you. Basically though....it doesnt' matter right? Cuz hes treating you nicer, so you should use that to your advantage. =)<br>  So basically either he just respects you more now, and thinks your really special cuz your still pure or...he just is being nice so he can try to be the one to take your v-card. You can probably determine which of these he is by his personality. is he extremely nice and a gentleman or is he kind of a horndog? You decide. Hope i helped. =)|`|vPjbSBhJaa	It is quite possible that he is taking on the challenge of your virginity and wants to correct that situation. You didn't say whether he is experienced or not, or whether he is a religious nut case or not. This can make a big difference in his purposes.|`|pXpOXRnDaa	Probably because virgins are a prize to find. He might think that you are looking for a guy since you have waited, so he is making himself available. That, and guys who are insecure don't have to worry about you judging them.|`|AA11603529	Either he thought you were a **** and that's why he was trying to hook up with you and when he found out you were a virgin it changed his mind..<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  ...He wants to take your v-card.|`|v96pYAg1aa	He wants to plow u thats all screw u thats what he wants
1Z0Lmrk1aa	It's sexual abuse and its highly likely that the teen girl was sexually abused herself or she never would have done this.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	sexual molestation or sexual abuse.<br>  <br>  it's still a crime even though the teenage girl is a minor and has probably been sexually abused by someone else herself.  She is now victimizing someone who either has no power to say no to her or who is not in a position to escape her.|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	Sexual Abuse / Molestation<br>  <br>  This is morally wrong, and also illegal.|`|2KC467tFaa	molestation, sexual abuse|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	Molestation|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Abuse|`|PNRvaBQcaa	1.

mrF6N9fiaa	Depends on how you feel about him. If your love is strong enough you can make it work. If you don't see it working in the long run then end it and move on. You should really think about what you want before making any rash decisions. Good luck!|`|PS83gPGoaa	go with ur gut feeling
WYEWzuvQaa	it's possible to be interested in two women at the same time if you allow your it. why? because the heart/mind is a complex structure and it function towards your emotions and feelings.<br>  at the same time, those feeling are under your control. are you infatuating with one and maybe actually love the other? you need to search your heart and see what you really want from both women.<br>  how will both women feel when they find out that your heart belong to another woman? are you sure you want to continue with both women?<br>  i mean at 36yrs, you can't afford such heart ache of been torn between two women, make up your mind and choose one and let the other one  find someone who will love her and place her at the top of his scale of preference. <br>  the earlier you get hold of your emotions the better, such uncertainty does not help if you are married because you will constantly feel nothing for your wife because of the delusion you feel for the other woman.<br>  one at a time to me is better and it will help you from taking a wrong decision.<br>  cheer up man it does happen. good luck.|`|l5IjG90oaa	yes. it's hard hard.. i'm a girl i've like 3 boys at once. alot. :S|`|ehLsAH08aa	its very possible, but you must decide on your own conscious whether its a good idea to be after 2? you should really choose one
9NfLuHo9aa	i know what u mean, but let her feel it and if she argues that's all u think about tell her how much she means to you and that is simply a reflex reaction to someone so beautiful and special to you. If she doesnt feel it, she may think u dont like her|`|HH7mqS4Qaa	haha; i think this is funny.<br>  somebody needs to get laid(:
H58JbpPNaa	Dude, Why are you so afraid of her feeling you, it might turn her on and things can go on from there.|`|3bB98sh4aa	Why wouldnt you want her to know you get hard?<br>  You want her to think your gay or something?<br>  Stop trying to have self control<br>  Its ok to get hard and kiss her Its not like shes gonna be offened by that<br>  Relax|`|3qjtZphNaa	oh well just put ur hand there<br>  if you fell like your going to get hard <br>  and how old are you<br>  email me<br>  !!!|`|ze4y2ltuaa	Ahh like the lass said, its more fun when both of you are turned on:D
X7DDlR1caa	Lol ... you really need to try and talk to her.. it was rude of you though i think i would fall out with my male 'Friend' if they farted next to my ear ew|`|vSHkZWUoaa	yes|`|361cbbdfa98c85b3d1f6eb2c810e33e2aa	its a very disrespectful thing to do.<br>  joking with her is one thing.  but when you fart on the phone, it's like farting in her face.  she expects the same level of respect she gives you, and what you did really showed her how much respect you have for her, your friend.<br>  <br>  go apologize and tell her you understand why what you did was wrong.|`|AA11963278	I have no idea why she would want to see a film twice within a month.<br>  <br>  But still... you must apologize for farting. That was completely unnecessary :L<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Or6RoRWDaa	lmao that's awesome, she shouldn't be disgusted at all, 20 years?! pssh|`|evJ2GEodaa	That is disgusting.|`|lymCWLcaaa	Maybe she likes u more than a friend..and she just wanted to spend more time with u..thats why she chose the crappy film-it was just an excuse!! she propably wants u to treat her more like a girl and was hurt that u didnt take her a bit more seriously. Go around to her with flowers..just a cheap bunch will do..its the thought that counts and just say sorry.....i really think she likes u more than a friend now!! u should start thinkin whether u like her that way now|`|ecdaf4ee0603201b08c5598b1ee9c0b2aa	Thats hilarious!|`|pEztJVlbaa	i would have laughed so hard lol<br>  what a sook it's not like the smell came through the phone but it was a bit rude lol..<br>  xx|`|zHtc3RuMaa	You are nasty and disrespectful!<br>  Yukkk!  <br>  Your friend will come around soon just DONT" EVER DO IT AGAIN to anyone...
faHWQYMIaa	my friend has started doing this. She only ever goes out with her older and younger brothers and I find it kinda awkward as I have absolutely nothing in common with either of them. It feels like we are being forced to be friends with them and lets face it who wants to hang out with people they have nothing in common with. There is only so much pleasant conversation one can have before losing the plot!<br>  <br>  I guess if everyone gets on ok its fine but be aware that you may choose to hang out with a sibling but your friends may not want to.|`|502dec9fad38e7335f99f13397a5c75daa	it sorta cause promblem....<br>  like what if you cuss and the kid learns???<br>  <br>  but.........<br>  <br>  you have think of your friends perspective...<br>  like <br>  why does she have to bring her sib....
ptQ5SkPVaa	Here's a thought, he wants to know!|`|dFHsAXDMaa	Because it is absolutely impossible for to adults to carry on a sexual relationship with out one or both eventually developing feelings towards the person. just human nature yu love and care about the person you are sharing yourself with. Love grows and complicates things. believing you can be friends with benefits and that is it is a myth. Question is do you love him cause he loves you?|`|klcqgST9aa	I think he wants you more than a FWB, he wants you as a girlfriend he can show his friends and parents. But, he wasn't sure if you felt the same way. If you did, he'd probably ask you to be his serious girlfriend, if you said no, he'd probably not do anything, and be a little sad. He wants more, and the casual sex isn't enough.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	maybe he's in Love with U|`|BPqK0c5taa	It sounds to me that he wants to be more then just friends with benefits and develop a real relationship with you. He has fallen for you and wants to know if you feel the same way. If you don't you just have to tell him this.|`|GQh9NyLuaa	I agree with previous answers... basically friends with benefits never works out because someone always gets attached.|`|jXnpJM0Oaa	Sounds like he's getting off on the idea that you're in love with him.  Now that love has entered the equation, it's no longer FWB.|`|mTRnOIodaa	IDK maybe he things your sexual relationship is more than what you do?|`|NxZl1Qccaa	he loves you|`|utGddhnVaa	maybe he loves you and wants to know your feelings|`|IPS3hWweaa	He's fallen for you and wants to know if you feel the same. Just be honest with him and tell him how you feel, but be ready for him to be wanting more out of you than just FWB.
3SSVBJAqaa	In self defense, and for the protection of someone smaller, yes. If it is a bedroom thing and the woman is into that sort of thing, yes. If it is for sports training, yes.<br>  <br>   Any other reason, no.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	No, just like a woman should never hit a man.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	No|`|fGE7hL12aa	self defense?|`|54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	Those who said no must be joking. I don't agree with hitting anyone but there are exceptions to the rule. You have some women that are physically abusive and others that are so crazy they will try to kill you. If the situation is an abusive relationship, the best thing to do is dump her. Otherwise you become the bad guy. The average woman is obviously not going to do these things.<br>  <br>  However, if it's a life or death situation, I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and die just because you're not supposed to hit girls.|`|elhcuN19aa	I say this<br>  1 in self defense-if she comes at me with a weapon<br>  2 if she gives you aids or some kind of non curable std from cheating and she knew she had it I would push her maybe I dunno but I would be hot no lie<br>  3 if she was attempting to kill some family member or friend and she was in the wrong... <br>  <br>  the thing is a man should use restraint against women at all cost but some women use this to their advantage.... I have little sympathy for the women who beat on their husbands and boyfriends and then they get hit one day.. You can say some had it coming to them<br>  you reap what you sow....<br>  It is always better to leave<br>  <br>  Remember ladies it is not right for you to hit a man too.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Only if he is in fear for his life.  I mean, if a woman has a weapon and means to do me serious harm?  Sure, I'll deck her.  But shy of that?  No, I don't think so.|`|AA11969451	If a woman puts herself in a mans place and takes a poke at a man she should be knocked flat on her a$$.|`|mzYsk112aa	Only if his life is in danger at that moment.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	No one is ever justified in hitting anyone.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	so how would you feel if i hit your woman?<br>  so why would you then?|`|nBQeSu2faa	Only in self-defence...be it man or woman.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Physical violence is never justified and personal assault is against the law. So, NO. A man who resorts to violence isn't a man but like a 2 year old throwing a tantrum because he has no control over his emotions.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Yes, sometimes.<br>  <br>  If she is abusing a child, if she is doing something that she must be stopped immediatly, if she hits him...more....<br>  <br>  However, a man should not hit a woman like he would hit another man. That he should never do.|`|dIw7MqTdaa	I don't think so, but the next step is justified, or at least it still is in some countries where there is law and order -- the very countries which treat women like slaves, unfortunately.|`|ch1f8LQCaa	never, maybe unless, the women was about to hurt his children, or if it was self defense, but then again it rare that a guy couldnt just waalk away from the girl cause guys tend to be bigger, but also, girls shouldnt hit guys either!|`|yZ7vjv86aa	Not unless it is defending yourself, just like there is no justification for a woman to hit a man.|`|zaYGRmOAaa	If I'm literally fighting for my life against a woman, I'm surely cracking her in the jaw......other than that, there's no justification.|`|2YX18RE2aa	Very very few situations occur which would justify that.<br>  <br>  Waking up to being hit with a baseball bat would be one such justification. There are not many others.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	only if she's your wife and you really want her to shut her big fat yap.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	NEVER!!!!|`|FKMKQbqPaa	no, never.|`|ZmyS0tkgaa	no never a real guy would not hit a girl|`|NeTNnvSZaa	The only time anyone should put their hands on another is in defense of themselves or another or in affection.<br>  <br>  No one should be hitting anyone (unless it's consensual).|`|POHWTDPRaa	If she is trying to kill him or anyone else then yes, he is perfectly entitled to do what he must to stop her. Otherwise, no. Nor should a woman hit a man unless she absolutely has to.
JhfN4tLLaa	Unless there is some kind of rule against dating co-workers then I say go for it. If you havent struck up conversation with her yet, I figure that's your first best move. Make casual conversation, if she appears interestedd back, ask her to hang out sometime and see where it goes.Best of luck!!|`|kDUkz5Ppaa	If you really like her you should ask her out. Just ask her if you would like to have dinner sometime.|`|POZvhqj4aa	if you like her go for it.|`|vrIQNPZhaa	i say ask her out but if she say no the first time i might give it a while
UWsidwCUaa	hi there it sounds like he is telling the truth and that he does love you and wants to be with u, and that he is too shy to admitt to his friends that he is loved up that y he probably hangs out with them when they ask him too, not saying that he is ashamed of you, but if he is young and you are his first love then its his first time, have his friends got gf cos if they aint then they wont understand, do not worry bout it he def loves you or he wouldnt tell you.|`|KKA0RYWjaa	CHRISTOPHER WALKEN|`|TXmAx8jwaa	Maybe his insecure. try and ring him and ask him why he keeps blowing you off.|`|BPqK0c5taa	Nope that doesn't look good. I put my girlfriend over everything else and I love her so yea I'm the opposite of your boyfriend. You have to tell him he needs to put you first.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend and I had a joke when we use to be so busy with our lives. I would tell her I want to be with her all the time there's just stuff I have to do which sometimes makes it impossible. And she told me well your the stuff I have to do. Probably one of the cutest things I have ever heard. It really worked for us.
xarKlp0Oaa	I would be really bummed out because families are suppose to stick together.|`|zamVDN8Aaa	Usually, in this case, it means the person who has posed rejection on another, means that they haven't the mental capability to deal with others' differences if they are extreme enough.<br>  I was ALMOST given away to my grandma because I admitted that I was bisexual to my mamma.<br>  She had realized after reading about it that it wasn't so bad.<br>  Educate whoever this person is that wants to banish another.|`|502dec9fad38e7335f99f13397a5c75daa	that they really dont like them...<br>  and maybe they have a reason...<br>  like they were molested by someone in their own family|`|RLoilwCNaa	I'd sell them out in a quick second for some cash.|`|satoCRC6aa	normal<br>   I have 8 siblings and that's what they do<br>  <br>  I don't agree with this behavior  but, its how they are and you cannot<br>  <br>   change stoop-id people<br>  <br>  you can change your Friends and who you spend your time with|`|SC91Uwrhaa	It happens, but it's not right. You can't change your family, but you can drop them...
IPS3hWweaa	Yeah, I like more independent women than having to constantly help a girl all day long.<br>  <br>  Maybe she's really pretty and they see that as a chance to date her or to get her in bed by helping her out (cause they think by helping she'll like them).|`|zUZRPmYAaa	I think guys like to take care of a girl, it makes them feel strong.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	Well the answer to your question is men and women are different. Men like something they control and women like something they cant control. Damsel in distress is easily controllable. Independent and cussing you out for over spending money is not. Now all guys are different and you cant judge them all. But id make a bet the damsel in distress women get more options than the miss independent with sometimes leads indirectly to miss stuck up. Which is why those women find themselves scratching their head wondering what went wrong. Especially in college. School works hard enough, you dont want your relationship to be a challenge too. With college guys you have to pull the trigger, quickly and let them know you like them and cut and butt everybody out. And let them know that you did. Otherwise anybody could step in on your turf.|`|BO28Mn8haa	shes just temporary. guys will always go for an "easy fix" but they will fall in love with the independent woman. i am a very independent woman and my hubby fell for me because of it. good luck to you|`|mdtkor2Paa	yes|`|jcL7gDMKaa	guys like to help girls out, makes them feel more like a man. I am a girl and remember when I got locked in a cemetary once, my work was in this building next to it and I must have taken the wrong exit leaving late at night when the customer exit was closed up. I ended up in this cemetary with really high fences with spikes on the top of them. I managed to get to this side of the cemetary which was near a main road and had to ask these 3 guys who were walking past to help me over the fence. They were really happy to help and I couldnt be more grateful! It was scary in there! haha|`|xNpVCEn2aa	Women should be independent but it's ok to give the guys an excuse to help you out sometimes, it makes them feel manly and like they can protect you, a feeling they apparently need to feel every now and then lol.  It won't hurt to seem a little in need of help every now and then just to make them feel they can help and protect you, doesn't mean you're any less independent, it's just something to do with their ego or something lol.|`|BTTFVbYYaa	men like to feel strong. she is manipulating them. their are men also also act weak, and some women like it but not everyone likes this type of thing, its a bit old fashioned. she sounds a boring person, you could hardly go on an adventure with her.  alot of men dont really go for this type they soon get bored its alright for a little while i suppose.|`|ab595311acfbfd9b16a828da10437178aa	Yea guys like independant women, i know i do, i like to do my thing and she can go do her thing and then meet up later during the day.  The other way around would be that she follows me everywhere and i would have to help her with everything that would get old.|`|H0khb5Dtaa	It fufils thier "Knight in shining armour" sterotype<br>  <br>  You normally find that guys prefer independant women as they get older|`|kU5Xv2i2aa	College guys are boys for one. Men like all different kinds of women. I'm so tired of trying to explain guys, they are crazy and complicated, yet so very simple.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Guys take it as easy. Women like that will fall for anything. Independent women are harder to convince.|`|5825710852c0ad1ada4995aad5f81a50aa	Not all guys... Just some. And the more independent guys typically like more independent girls. But there's fewer of both of those and that's why it seems like all the guys like this girl.|`|v96pYAg1aa	ok thats a big turn off :( sorry bleh|`|57JfZHNdaa	Men like to feel like men...most of them at least. Their ego means alot to them and having a woman to boost it means alot to them. The guys I know like independant women but they like when the women can let their guard down a bit to let them 'save' them once in a while. Imagine a manly man who has a woman that doesnt need him for manly things. Men by nature are supposed to be hunters, providers, soldiers and protectors...no matter what culture. When my hubby met me I was on my own and very independant but I made sure that he knew he was the man. Maybe you should try letting your guard down a bit.<br>  <br>  FYI, while guys do like independant women as much as the like a 'damsel in distress', I dont know much guys that will be patient with an insecure woman. Dont be so hung up on your roommate and how guys react to her.|`|ulY2cmutaa	Well think about it...Men like to be powerful,strong,brave etc.. Simply put they get to the hero with this type of girl. And vice versa for a woman this type of guy is her night in shining armor..Here to save the day!!! It actually a common thing amongest most cultures. Even animals men are always going to look for ways to display dominance and strength. Without even thinking about it a man is more likely to put himself in harms way to get the ***** cat...I'm sorry I mean save the ***** cat.|`|B9dONyROaa	Yeah we like independent women, however, Women needing us turns us on and makes us feel manly. We kind of feel like James Bond and all men love that feeling of being needed.

abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	Sounds like my man .I wish I can help you more . I think its a real shame some guys are not confident enough to be upfront and honest or atleast secure with themselves .I guess most guys are just afraid of saying something wrong|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Have you asked him directly what method of communication would he prefer to get marital issues resolved before they become big.|`|xC9SIZbGaa	Try to start with something he can relate to, like I dunno, work problems or something. Make him talk about himself first.. if he catches on and gets into the mood of talking u should be fine :) <br>  I've always been a quiet guy and my girlfriend (when we first met) once said she wants me to talk, now we're going out - I cant stop when she's around :)|`|FzFSzilmaa	let him know you are there when he is ready... and that you want to hear what he has to say...<br>  <br>  BUT don't pressure him or he'll just not try...|`|SovaFpN8aa	I also am the quiet type, my wife is outgoing. She works hard to be in control of our relationship and me. She complains I don't open up to her, but she has two modes, 1) she tries to push her ideas down my throat, it's her way or the wrong way. 2) she can't force me, so she cries, in an attempt to manipulate me. These things don't work.<br>  Now I don't know you or all the details of your relationship, I can only speak from my experiences.<br>  Quit being pushy, being quiet does not mean he's dumb. Respect him as a person and respect that he is a man. He wants to take care of you and your family. Quit trying to control him and being so competitive with him about who is in charge of the relationship. Show him you love him. be physically attentive and spontaneous. Your relationship is not a game, it's not a competition, it should be a partnership. He is not always going to agree with you, and he is sometimes going to do things his own way. Trust his judgment. <br>  REMEMBER THIS (old saying - very true) "You catch more bees with honey, than with vinegar"
SovaFpN8aa	Quit playing emotional games. Be receptive and willing when he wants it, and tell him he owes you when you really want it. You quit trying to punish or control him by with holding it when he wants it.|`|AA12316366	maybe you just don't turn him on.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	I feel your pain my man is perhaps in the same boat .If all else fails just lie naked next to him ,,,if he does not show any interest then something is wrong with him and not you ..I would then wonder|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	Why don't you take matters into your hands...if you catch my drift. Throw on something a little sexy and then sit next to him on the couch and start to seduce him a little bit. Rub his leg, then move up and start to touch his well you can get the picture. Once you get him excited I doubt he'll turn you down!<br>  <br>  Also when you do that, do something a little extra for him that he would really enjoy to show him that when you are the one that wants it, it means really good things for him!!|`|fMEypXDYaa	Go with the flow I guess, at least he is still having sex with you. Talk to him about your needs sexually, he should at least listen to you and respect your wishes.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Discreet side action. It seems that he is only interested in his own pleasure. How selfish.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Compromise. He has to agree to give it up sometimes when you want it and he doesn't. Same thing with you. When he's in the mood and you are not, you gotta get yourself in the mood and just enjoy it. It's a silly thing to argue about, you know. If you recall, sex is fun, enjoyable, relieves stress, boosts the immune system, and best of all it is free. There's no real reason to not have sex if you are physically able. Both of you could learn to get yourselves in the mood whenever the other person wants it. That's a much better challenge than trying to get the other person to do it your way.|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	you might need to role reversal.  think of the things that turn you on and try them on him.  Just like most woman foreplay to be an all day thing, not just once you get in the bed.  try packing his lunch one day and leaving a sexy note for him.  try calling him up during the day just to see how his day is going.  you know where I am going with this.  woman enjoy those things and I am sure he will too.  his might be stressed on have a lot on his mind which distract him from sex.  so try different things and I am one of them will work.|`|tdulyzXXaa	Quit nagging.|`|F6dApOJtaa	Start off by doing something that he likes.

e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	I have the same problem with my relationship. I think she is cheating with a ex and I'm bored with her. I know she Loves me to , but my trust in her is gone.<br>  I'm trying to keep the relationship going, but its hard to do it.<br>  Good Luck|`|gCe49yV8aa	I think you should have an HONEST talk with him about this. Tell him (calmly and nicely; no yelling or screaming!) that you love him but you are worried that he's cheating on you. ASK HIM TO PLEASE BE HONEST FOR THE BOTH OF YOU. <br>  <br>  Remember to make sure it's true before you end this relationship.<br>  <br>  If it is, then it will probably be a hurtful and heartbreaking time but YOU WILL GET THROUGH IT. Unfortunately if it's true, you definately should break up with him. It's better for both of you, if he is cheating on you he's probably not happy with this relationship ethier but doesn't know how to say it. <br>  <br>  If it isn't true, you probably should apologize and try to move on. It will probably be awkward for a while, but hopefully you will both be able to move on and connect again. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!!!|`|gd5XGTakaa	try to spice it up a little bit... but if he is cheating on you get rid of him... seduce him though|`|BO28Mn8haa	ugh DUMP HIM. you will find better. trust me. been there done that|`|mdtkor2Paa	break up with him|`|HSTCnFZ6aa	if he is cheating on you he does not love you. end of story. If you're bored (and obviously he is too) just break it off. Whats the point in prolonging something that won't work out in the end?  There is better out there for you. Don't be scared to leave something youre not happy with.|`|Gsqt4ODYaa	Show him this question, and all the answers that follow.

We always aim for at least one night a week, maybe two if we can. Since your relationship is early, see if you can possibly meet another night during the week. It doesn't hurt to ask.|`|T1ffrjHAaa	Thats not good. Sounds like it is for his benefit, not yours. Sorry, but I think he has something to hide.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	well i was seeing my fella 3-4 times a week for the first couple of months|`|0e7e2273a98e965ef6963c7287e9faffaa	Well it depends on the individual, when I first started seeing my husband I saw him every night for a week then didn't see him for a few days and then every night until we moved intogether 3 months later. I would expect at least one night in the week as well as one or 2 at the weekend. Why not ask him to meet up midweek next week and see what his reaction is|`|TrEYixLXaa	Hmmm, one night a week?  That doesn't seem like a lot.  I mean, atleast for me, when I like someone I would like to see them more often than that.<br>  <br>  Maybe he just works a lot through the week?  Or has a busy schedule?  <br>  <br>  And it's only been a month, I don't think you should mention anything about making it exclusive as of yet...  Give it just a little more time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10266072	One night a week on the weekend?  It sounds like you're a booty call.  If you have feelings for the guy then tell him that you do.  If you want to be exclusive with the guy then talk to him about it.  If he gives you the run around, can him!!!<br>  <br>  Unless you like being a booty call.|`|fqboOITjaa	I've been seeing my guy since New Years, we live very closeby and I see him most evenings per week, about 3 or 4 evenings and then at the weekends.|`|FzFSzilmaa	depends on work, social calendar, location, and many other things... maybe once a week - weekend...|`|OAYaeW22aa	4 out of 7 days|`|drEfr9waaa	I wonder if he's married?|`|rj004nrlaa	Hmmm well I'm in a new relationship myself and I think after a month we were seeing each other every day but then we seem to have moved at a super fast speed and both fallen quite hard for each other. Normally after a month I would be expecting once or twice a week. I wouldn't expect anything exclusive after a month but I would be thinking having that talk was on the cards. If he's still like it after two months I would say it's time to find out where you stand.
0gFraAzLaa	well everyone makes mistakes. just forget that mistake n move on if u really love her u wuld say im super sorry. but move on there are other fishes in the sea lol seriously u are still young
mPZmze1Naa	i met my first, and to this day only love when i was 12, and i really didn't like him but he just didn't quit so eventually we became friends then a year later i was more head over heels that i could have possibly imagine. i mean going from hating boys with their 'boy germs' to falling in love with one, while still relatively young totally changed me...but of course as fate would have it in high school we got spilt up into different classes and it became harder to talk to him. i love him still and a day doesnt go by where i dont think of myself n a differest situation with him (getting married, naming our children, just having another chance to kiss him) i got it bad, and i am in love with him, not matter what anybody else thinks about teenage crushes ( i am now 17 btw)

You are entering a new phase in your life and you should not tie yourself down. You should be concentrating instead of getting through college and perhaps into a Master's program - not worrying about who to date.<br>  <br>  Besides, a 25 year old man who is interested in a 17 (almost 18) year-old girl is not much of a man. You may be flattered by the attention of an older male, but he needs to date women in his own age group who are his equals in intellect and life experience.|`|wu4K4jWdaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AipNdGgaXvJxwxfQvjsphhjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227084605AA9mWxi">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  please answer my question.<br>  <br>  <br>  and you should tell him that you like him a lot and just see what he says and then wait until you are 18 because you don't want anything illegal to happen there... ya know.|`|x9UuVWLnaa	i think you should tell him excatly how you feel.. you can never go wrong that way.|`|etRqqI11aa	just tell him how much u like him and how valuable he is to u<br>  <br>       while u tell him if he also says that he likes u <br>               greet him with a warm hug|`|Jhr68T0baa	You need to be true to yourself, and tell him how you feel. if hes one of your friends it will be fine whatever the outcome!<br>  good luck,|`|gCzQIalUaa	just tell him how u feel  but make it seem like ur not uber obsessed with him   just be ur self|`|7EQgVsudaa	ok that sounds really sweet,<br>  <br>  before really going into the groove with him, try flirting with him a little bit, to check his reaction, then go..<br>  <br>  i can tell u the words that u should say,,,but i wont..because....it will be my words,,,u have to say him the words that best describe your feelings,,,say what is truly inside u and i am sure he'll take it as said.

AA10684513	Sounds like you need to sit him down and tell him how you feel.  Maybe the two of you need to fall in love with each other all over again.  12 years is a long time to just walk away from and sex with another man isn't a good enough reason to leave.|`|HGK3Fb5aaa	you sound very selfish and cowardly.  Not what you wanted to hear but that what it sounds like when your talking about taking kids away from their dad so that you can have sex with another man...  what if you have sex with someone else and find that you don't like it and that you really love your husband.  How bad are you going to feel and you single handedly tore apart your family for this man that you never even met!  Grow up|`|PuQyYMM8aa	Just remember that the Grass is Never Greener on the other side. The decision you make will not only affect you, but your husband and 5 children. Make sure you think long and hard before you do anything.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Helpful answers? <br>  Leave your husband, let him have the kids because you really don't want to worry about them while you're out partying all night sleeping around with total strangers.  Hopefully he will realize that nothing about the divorce was his fault and won't be too traumatized to move on.  Then maybe he can find a woman who will appreciate him for the good man and good father that he is and who is perfectly happy sleeping with only him.  <br>  That's what you wanted to hear right, that what you're thinking of doing is the right answer?  Get over yourself; you're stupid and selfish, and he really does deserve better.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	The grass is NEVER greener on the other side. Also let me tell you this. My sister works in the Er of the hospital. She has told me that on a daily basis, there are tons of people between the ages of 15-30 who test positive for HIV and many other STD's. So if having sex with someone else is that important to you, then go for it. Just keep in mind that it may end up costing you your life, or leaving you with a STD that you can't get rid of. Then no one will ever sleep with you again.<br>  <br>  Also how would you feel, if this were your husband posting this same question here? Would that effect you at all? Hurt your feelings? crush you?
whHVJc0gaa	uh oh may be he hasother girls text or he might think you dont trust him|`|AA11036219	If he is done with all of that then he shouldn't have a problem leaving it out. Something is surely wrong, find out what.|`|rPwHPKv5aa	cos he doesn't want u looking at his porno|`|3YzXWHwbaa	He definitely has texts on there that he does not want you to see.  Or he doesn't want you answering his phone when it rings.<br>  My question would be what is he hiding?  Another girl from you or you from another life?|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	Tell him that! He shouldn't be hiding anything from you.... especially if you suspects him cheating and if he isn't really cheating, then he should prove it.|`|AA11356977	Duh hes cheating. WHY are you still with a guy that doesnt respect you?????????????????????????????????????...|`|WPd4MYt6aa	HE'S CHEATING!!!!!|`|9MxlhuXzaa	To me, it sounds like he is OBVIOUSLY hiding something. If he wasn't, he wouldn't care. You shouldn't want to go through his cell phone and if you do, you don't trust him. ( I don't blame you) I believe someone doesn't need to be in the relationship if you can't trust them. He is going through your phone because he doesn't trust you either. Tell him how you feel. I know that is harder to do than it is to say, but you shouldn't be with someone you can not talk to comfortably. <br>  <br>  Good luck honey!|`|9QeV07zJaa	To him, you are just one girl.  your relationship hasn't reached the level of "the one". And kudos to him for it, because you are probably way too controlling anyway. You will never be able to demand his exclusive attention and succeed at it.  Give him some space.|`|YPNEom7Qaa	He is hiding something...|`|faeXRQmcaa	Tell him straight out! If he had nothing to hide, he wouldn't have a problem!|`|xd7tSmQeaa	He has other bimbo's numbers in there.  Tell him to come clean or hit the road.|`|17y42pNraa	My guess is that he is cheating on you. Thats the only reason I would do all that with my phone...|`|kE8O4Xzvaa	HE is defiantly hiding something> I had something like that happened to me .my fiancee would take his phone in the shower with him and have it on silent .one day at work i called his phone and it just went right to v-mail and i was able to crack his v-mail code to listen to this message. I couldn't believe what I heard my fear of him cheating was confirmed. My advice is to tell him how you feel and let him know it really bothers you that he hides his phone  and if he doesn't like what you have say screw him and move on you should be with someone who doesn't make you worry all the time.|`|AA10608675	Sweetie , He is cheating on you. That's way he won't let you see his phone, he doesn't want you to find out. That's also why he gets mad when you get noticed by other guys. He's wants control and he knows what he's been up to and he doesn't want you doing it too.<br>  <br>  The bigger problem he is that you say "Breaking up with him is not an option, I feel that he is able to change into a nicer person." <br>  <br>  You can't change anyone who doesn't want to change. If he is bold enough to disrespect you by flirting with other girls in front of you image what he's doing when you are not around. Stop trying to work on him and work on yourself.<br>   Remember : <br>  You can do better than this guy. Dump him before he really hurts you.
417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	First Andrew, you need to sit down and figure out why they became your X in the first place. Then...if you are sure it will work, try calling them, try getting back in their life..Sure hope things work out the way you want them to.|`|WLsS5vxsaa	Here is a great website that you can check if you want to: <a href="http://www.exbackguides.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbackguides.com/</a>|`|5qUUP1Rsaa	Personally, I feel that you must first decide whether your relationship is worth saving? Almost all relationship can be saved but it is a matter of hard work put in correctly to actually make things work. Once you decided that your relationship is worth saving, you will need to put in a commitment to get back your ex accordingly. <br>  <br>  As I do not know how long you have broken up with your ex so I would just advice you to watch the video on the website that I have shared with you. The video is called "How to Get You Ex Back Opening Move?". Hope this will help you to get back your ex and live a happily life as before.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	well that depends what happend if she can forgive you, were you being honest about things, open and just talking, to see what the problems were, if there is any feelings left between you both if its worth trying again???? thats what you have to look at first. you have to prove to her that you can change and not make those mistakes again. just tell her how much you love and care about her. good luck
V96p5opeaa	An ex is an ex for a reason.  There were obviously issues that broke the relationship to begin with.  You have to ask yourself some questions.  Why do you want this person back? (honestly)?  Also, supposing that you did get your ex back.  What has changed?  Have you changed?  Has the other person changed?  What is different that would make the relationship work the 2nd time around?  If nothing has changed, then what would be the point of trying again?  The same problems would still be there.  Are you willing to waste your time on something you know isn't going to work?  Is it not better to take what you learned from the relationship and move forward?  Are you just lonely and want to run back because of the familiarity of that relationship?  <br>  <br>  Ask yourself those questions before putting any real effort into thinking of ways to get him/her back.   If, after you've really thought about it, and you honestly think you want that person back in your life.. then try to stay in contact with the person.  It takes both parties to make the effort.  You can try, try, try, but if the other person is not willing, it's not going to happen. <br>  <br>  Also, It depends upon why and how the relationship ended in the 1st place.   Who initiated the breakup?  How did it end? and above all...are you willing to put your feelings on the chopping block again?|`|c2YcBbXyaa	why do you want to?  there must be something wrong with him, or he wouldn't be your ex..........find someone new and start over|`|2d346e459f2dd1812301699723870984aa	My husband saves used air filters and cracked distributor caps from his car in case he ever needs them again.  ex-what?  If it was bad enough to replace, why would you ever need it again?  I invested a lot of years into one, but after I escaped I never wanted him again.  20 years later he wanted me again.  Only I knew what he wanted me for.  Ain't having that.  Move on and throw the garbage in the garbage.|`|Sh7pyRpzaa	This is too vague of a question with no info to work with. I guess you could try the book "The Love Dare"..... and watch the movie "Fireproof"- but there is only so much you can do- it takes both of you to make a relationship|`|NohEhCrDaa	Rather just move on. <br>  You can never fix a cracked mirror.
9NfLuHo9aa	nothing is wrong with a tidy bush but definition of tidy differs for women, some may have a forest and consider it tidy and want the guy to go down there. once it isnt too much but more like a really thing airplane strip or a wide very low cut lawn is good but wide and high isn't too hot. Some guys like it and some don't but i think if u were my girl, u do what u want. Asking you to do something you aren't comfortable with is being selfish. Also there are women as old as 40 and up that keep it shaved completely, some women think it looks childish but some think its cleaner with no hair which is true as there is less chance of infections with no hair but its  a matter of doing what you're comfortable with or shaving how much is necessary for compromise. Don't just give in, give in a little but be true to what you want still|`|utGddhnVaa	oxymoron? I don't understand|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Acceptable in 1970<br>  <br>  what?

You are just confessing your feelings, not proposing for marriage. <br>  <br>  You aim is to get the message across to her, so do that. <br>  <br>  Don't wait till its too late.

If every time you have a disagreement you have to worry that he/she will go out and find another warm body, you do not have a good relationship.<br>  <br>  If a woman gives all to her man - love, kindness, support, physical intimacy, shared meals, loyalty, spiritual intimacy - he will respond in kind. IF he does not, he's not the right man. Another person cannot "steal" your partner if he/she is totally satisfied with what he/she already has.|`|AA11105522	well i would examine myself realize the part i played in it and try to change it for the future or put things in place so i dont do whatever it is i may have or may have not done. but at the end of the day keep in mind that a man is going to always be a man and do whatever he wants anyway. reality of it is he could have told you months ago that he felt like he was slipping away, that's a two way street.|`|qnQi1tonaa	No one can take anyone from anybody that's a great big myth. He evidently ran into someone he's more attracted to or lusting after, and wants to make you feel inadequate about your self esteem. In all relationships you'll never see eye to eye on everything, if you do, that only means someone in that relationship is living a lie and is not happy, completely.|`|8zd6OqJ5aa	This is kind of difficult to answer but for the most part it would ultimately be his decision.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure as to why you helped give him away... that is kind of confusing, but also it seems like you weren't trying to stay with him.<br>  <br>  But like you said, my opinion is that it's 80% his fault because he went with the other girl, If he truly loved/liked you he wouldn't have gone to anyone else you know?<br>  <br>  Hope this helped =]|`|Qz4n1l0zaa	No man can be stolen, in my opinion. If he's now "attached" to someone else, that's his fault, not yours. That was his personal choice to let himself pay more attention to the other woman. <br>  <br>  I think he's just looking for a way to justify what he did.|`|NxZl1Qccaa	he can't be stolen he went along with it, every person makes their own choices, even though you made him angry but he still CHOSE to go along with the other woman.|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	I DNT THINK HE GOT STOLEN BECAUSE THE OTHER GIRL WASNT PLANNING ON ANYTHING. HE DID IT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO AND NOW HIS JUST LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE, AND I GUESS UR THE EASY TARGET|`|iTf0l9Wlaa	i think you have to go along with something like that dont let him play the guilt trip on you|`|kZxnV1sHaa	I believe that if you are going thru things, this is when the relationship is most at risk, if your mate isn't talking to you, then they will find someone else to talk to. I believe that someone that sympathizes with you can actually steal you away, I have been thru it, only on the other end. I believe that both parties involved are to the blame. never let the lines of communication break, you have to put yourself in the others shoes. We women think that we are always right, it is really hard to admit, when we are not.|`|7bf9eef2e23eccf12b89c8b9adeff001aa	when a man says that it's our fault because the fell for someone else, then it is our fault. that other person they fell for did something that we couldnt do. guys need alot of attention and if they dont get it from their wifes or girlfriends. they will go find it some where else believe me. i know.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	It sounds like he's a typical jerk trying to blame you because he's a cheating scumbag. Let her have him. He's no prize and if he cheated on you he will cheat on her. He's just like the creep who beats his wife and then blames her for making him mad. Be glad you're rid of this jackass. You deserve better.|`|a0b40c7a80dd3de9085039f8daf76ec6aa	I believe that if a man is leaving you for somebody else, you have had a part in it. He isn't satisfied with you in some way, not interested in you as much as in that other woman. If man is a real man he will not go along with being stolen from someone he loves. There you can your conclusions from this, he must have been the wrong man for you and you are the wrong woman for him.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	You are absolutely right he can not be stolen he chose to walk away and he is at fault... he was the weak one for walking away instead of dealing with issues at hand....<br>  <br>  <br>  someone once told the me: The key to a great Marriage is agreeing to just simply disagree sometimes... <br>  <br>  Move on the right guy is out there for you somewhere searching for you.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	I honestly believe that in a relationship there are two people that must work to keep things together.  You can have dips, and that's when the other person picks up the slack.  If you pulled away, he should have cared enough to question and help make you feel more comfortable.  At the same time, why did you pull away?  Was there something that could have been better remedied by talking things out?<br>  <br>  SO...you cant steal a guy...unless hes ok with being stolen...if he really wanted to be with you, he would have easily said no to that girl and talked tings out with you.<br>  <br>  i would get over it and find somone who would work through a tough spot jsut to be with you.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11603529	He did it because he wanted to. He liked the other girl and just followed his instincts to be with her instead of you. A man can't really be "stolen" unless you think that she had malicious intent to break the two of you up. You, though may or may not, have had any part in it. Did you fight to keep him?|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	It takes two to Tango, he went along with it.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. <br>  Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually. <br>  Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company. <br>  Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else. <br>  Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you. <br>  Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well. <br>  Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. <br>  Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?|`|briRpzL1aa	Talk to him... But you are almost 30, then you probably already realize this...<br>  <br>  Also, what you are experiencing is called a crush...|`|FG9hjIIjaa	You will know if he is into you if he calls you, makes plans with you, and acts as if he cares. Do not accept a man who just texts you, wants to "meet up" at midnight, and does not take you out in front of friends or family|`|6d4T93tHaa	does he try to do things to make you happy? does he give up  things to be with you?  I'm not sure if there is an answer to if he feels the same but if he is there for you then he's into you.|`|FVYPFRKjaa	ask him . does he flirt with you ? maybe you should get to know him .

Just because you like arty things and rock music doesnt mean you have to live your live a particular way. If you are that bothered that your room is messy and you dont do your school work then just tidy your room and stop being so lazy at school. If you take control of these parts of your life that you are unhappy with then the rest will start to sort itself out. You are not your mum and dad, plenty of people have parents that divorced and go on to have perfectly happy relationships, but like everyone else in the world you have to go through some bad ones first.<br>  Just relax and if there are parts of you life that you are unhappy with then work to fix them.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	your interests seem normal !<br>  and because you dont have self confidence, guys see you as an easy target. just think that you know youre pretty, so why are you worrying? if you dont like your weight, diet a bit but as long as youre still happy. and you have boyfriends, there are many people who have NEVER dated at your age.x|`|AYXFrNfFaa	you sound like you need to sort yourself out... be happy... make some kind of a life for yourself, your still young, the right guy will come along at the right time. don't rush things. your still young|`|gROdxDhRaa	banands|`|NZVP15Soaa	you are totally mixed up<br>  you already know whats wrong with you<br>  you say they mistreat you - why do you let them <br>  if you don't learn in life and except this kind of treatment is not acceptable -it will keep on happening to you thats the whole idea of learning - you nip it in the bud from the start or just walk away from the relationship<br>  you put up with the above and then you say you are lazy and your room is always dirty-for goodness sake have some respect for yourself tidy and clean up your room that will make you feel better -you have got to brighten yourself up don't let yourself go with how you dress and present yourself to others- feel confident stop going over whats happened in the past -its past- we can't alter whats happened yesterday so don't keep going over and over whats happened to you -be positive your rooms tidy you are tidy hold your head up and be confident. i don't see nothing wrong in rock music/art and fashion -great -aim for something you want to do in the next two years-when you have achieved this aim for something else in the next two years<br>  always aim for things you want-you wont have time to be depressed -I have every confidence in you -good luck<br>  <br>  take care
gd5XGTakaa	yea... it doesn't seem like he is going to take the lead... maybe he doesn't know how to confront you about it... you should take the lead if it is something you think you might like|`|gCe49yV8aa	It sounds like he likes you!!! Sure, go ask him out! It's not the 1800's, girls can totally ask guys out!!! <br>  <br>  Tell me how it goes!|`|ze4y2ltuaa	that guys sounds like a creep in alot of cases, so i'd tell him your not interested.|`|LbzQtQb9aa	ask.......or else he's just gonna keep it like that and never......you know.....|`|hIdVdd28aa	In bars you ill only find such guys.<br>  <br>  Go to temples, library's ,gyms, yoga centre , to a park with good book to read where u get lot of OXYGEN too.<br>  Ins ted when you go to barsubmergesubmege in smoke also and spoil your health too.<br>  <br>  Get in to social service at your free time, visit orphanages, hospitals , etc dnd do services for in case if u don't prefer to to going to temples.

That is what I would do!|`|mdtkor2Paa	you take the lead and ask|`|B6ewoj37aa	He obviously likes you. And he is obviously weird.

You two like each other so go ahead and explore. Don't rush though, if he is the shy type, he'll like it that way. Best of luck.|`|BTTFVbYYaa	well if he hasent asked you out by now and he,s kissed you already he is obviously not shy and so i would question if he has someoen else so tread carefully.
ptQ5SkPVaa	I'm afraid the damage done may be to severe for either one of you. Maybe you should think about moving on.|`|Gsqt4ODYaa	Don't trust him.<br>  <br>  When he cheated on you with her, he wasn't thinking about you at all.  He completely disregarded you in every way.  That means he doesn't really care.  He can say whatever he wants in his defense, but honestly he can't really care about you.  The only girl I dated that I cheated on, I felt terrible, but the fact of the matter was I didn't care for the first girl.  I would never cheat on my girlfriend now in a million years because I'm in love with her.<br>  <br>  I think it's time to end this relationship and really start THAT healing process, which includes a grocery list of movies, and ben and jerrys.<br>  <br>  I know it's not something you want to hear, but he isn't right for you.  Leave him now and save yourself much more heartbreak later.|`|AA11603529	First of all, if he did it once he could very well do it again. And the fact that this girl was your friend is worse off. This means that even though they pretend to be true to you, they are going behind your back. You should probably break up with this guy because the past tends to repeat itself.|`|AA10266072	That's why you never date people you work with!  You need to just stop talking to both but you can't because you work with them.  Good Luck.|`|JUvOKsevaa	If he cheated on you once, he'll probably do it again.  Since you took him back, he'll figure that if he does it again, you may get really angry with him, but you will probably take him back again in due time.  Seriously, leaving him is a pretty good thing to look at.  He couldn't love you as much as you think he does, if he was willing to cheat on you (and risk your relationship), especially with a good friend of your's.<br>  <br>  I dated a guy for four years and I took him back after he cheated on me.  He cheated on me again before we broke up and he is now married to her, and he cheats on her, but she refuses to see it.  I learned my lesson and I'm glad I am no longer with him because I finally found the man of my dreams.|`|uHUyAzGnaa	I haven't been in this exact situation, but recently, I found out that one of our bestfriends, slept with another bestfriends gf. Its very similiar to your situation, except the went through with it all. The friend is very hurt. Not so much with the cheating gf, but my friend is upset that their entire frienship is destroyed, and they can no longer trust that person in any aspect of their life. I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. Right after I found out about the situation, I made a video discussing this whole topic about sleeping with friends significant others, here it is: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJ2Z1Zsm0s&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKJ2Z1Zsm...</a>
VHE22iNbaa	These things are complicated and there are no easy answers.<br>  <br>  Few things in life are more upsetting and painful than a broken relationship. I can tell you from experience that when you're upset by relationship problems, it's very hard to figure out what to do next. <br>  <br>  One thing is for sure - you need to cut him loose for awhile. Don't phone, IM, text, or chase him in any way. Go out with your friends and make it look like you're doing fine without him.<br>  <br>  The fact that he said there is hope is a very good sign. Just make sure you play your cards right and don't let him keep you on a string because he will eventually lose respect for you and you will lose respect for yourself.<br>  <br>  When my boyfriend and I broke up, I did some really stupid things at first because I wasn't thinking straight.<br>  <br>  I ended up listening to my best friend who was constantly telling me to back off for a while. She's always messing around on the internet and found one of those online books about fixing relationships but analyzing them first. It has some very interesting stuff in it.<br>  <br>  It worked for me because I was such a wreck I was in no condition to decide what to do on my own, and the book tells you everything you need to do.  If you want to check it out, here's the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezurl.eu/getthemagic" rel="nofollow">http://ezurl.eu/getthemagic</a><br>  <br>  It's been six weeks and my ex boyfriend and I aren't completely back together, but it seems to be working out pretty well. Personally, I feel better because I have some understanding and a plan. I don't feel like everything is out of control and I accept that it will take time.<br>  <br>  The best of luck and I hope it works out.|`|AA11103493	Sorry, but I don't know what to say to you.  I don't know what help you need.  It sounds like he wants to have his cake and eat it too.  I think you should stand up for yourself, you deserve to be treated better.  If he goes on March 1st, don't let him back in your life.  Yes, of course he should see his kids, and you can have a friendly relationship but move on.  Find yourself another man who treats you the way you should be treated and not like a servant.|`|PeOCqztoaa	Sounds like he might be having a mid life crisis. Sounds like he still wants to feel young by going out and drinking.|`|HzEtvI7gaa	thats a long time but if you think you really know and like him then go for it.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I am 46 years old, married for 22 years, and we have two children living at home.  We have sex probably 8-12 times per month.  The quality is very good to me, probably a 7 or so on a 1-10 scale.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Sorry but you should never go by what other people do or don't do.  Each person has their own amount of sex they need.  The trick is to talk about it with your partner and try to be on the same page in compatability.  Its hard to work out opposites where one wants it a lot and the other doesn't.  That's why you have so many problems in the bedroom cause people don't talk about how much they want before they get married.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Both in our 40s, married over a decade, and have kids. Striving to do it at least 200 times this year per Dr. Oz.  You can do the math for yourself.|`|gfHutvEFaa	I am 37, married 13 years and my husband is 42. We (on average) have sex 4-5 times per week. Sometimes a little more, other times (1st couple days of the "visitor") a little less.

There's always room for improvement! =]<br>  <br>  We both work full time jobs also.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well my husband is 42 and I am 26 we have sex almost 3 times a day when ever we get to see each other I work a full time job and he is disabled he is fair when it comes to it though I would have to give him a 6 better than boarderline<br>  we also have 4 kids between us still at home <br>  hope this helps|`|9KIICFdIaa	At that point in my life we were having sex about twice a week if not more. Sex is always good, whether you have been married for 10 or 20 years. If not maybe you need something from the outside to spice it up. Scale of 1 to 10, probably an 8.|`|RBRq8406aa	This is what a question i posted yesterday was related to in that how much or often people have sex. It is a individual thing not something that can be set as everyone must have sex a set number of times in a given time period. But in this regard 43 and married over 21 years and maybe 4 times a month. Which really doesn't make any difference to your situation since, as I stated, its a by couple thing as to how often not something that you need to measure against other people.|`|FKMKQbqPaa	43, married 12 years, we have sex about once a week.  i believe it is good, but it is different than the fiery newby sex.  i find my focus is shifted from the thrill of sex to a deeper feeling, more like sharing.  i enjoy it for the connection and time together more than the thrill of sex like earlier in our relationship.  i would give it a 5 or 6.  we have two kids.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	2 or 3 times a month.  We both have very active lives and I am only home 1.5 or 2 days a week.  I would have to give our sex life a big fat 10+|`|oMGasIcjaa	Probably have sex about once every week or two.   Married 10 years. Two small kids, plus both parent work full time.  36 and 34 years old.  usually too tired to have much quality there.  About a 5 on your rating scale. Hope this helps! :)

If you are 30 going for a 16 year old you are a cougar. But if you are a 40 year old going for a 25 year old you are cougar. If you are 30 going for a 25 year old your not. It all depends on the age of the person you are going for.|`|KTgtdOn0aa	rawr
IQEf57ANaa	well i dont advice you to say anything, waht you have to do is to send him signal. For example, look at him in a cute way, if he looks at you, you have to smile. try playing around with him,like grabbing his *** or touching his arms, act like if it was just game.<br>  <br>  if you see that things are moving nicely or not moving at all. then you can move to the second step that is to talk to his friends and ask them questions about the guy you like, you can learn a lot for friends, and even them can talk to him about you. <br>  <br>  and finally you can actually talk to him face to face and tell him how you feel, this si very hard to do i know, but if it works then you will have a relationship.<br>  <br>   two other tihngs, dont tell him anything in your birthday, he cna feel too much pressure becuase it is your birthday and he wont want you to feel bad. <br>   <br>   secondly, if you are gonig to university, are you still going to be in the same city as him ? you probably want to think aobtu that.
dat8eoYyaa	she is messed up, dont want her getting knocked up ! she will lose friends over what she is doing eventually cuz u wont want pep. thinking that about u, tell her straight up what she is doing is nasty...like when she looks back when not n highschool n e more, she will b messed up from all that crap
ca885a36c62133275b878913badf41ccaa	you can't be controlled by any guy. tell him your going clubbing. just do it. he needs to show you he trusts you so it's no biggie if you dance with other guys or him with other girls, as long as you both end up together at the end of the night.<br>  trust is the key word here|`|vSHkZWUoaa	yes

4MXWu6ctaa	in my opinion, its best to tell the truth, but then again you have got to realise that the truth hurts, i know it might sound harsh and all that, but lying to her, and leaving her that there could be still a chance between you and her, would only hurt her in the long run.<br>  <br>  so in my opinion, just tell her, that you don't feel that you and her could be an item anymore. you still care for her and she'll always be someone important to yourself, but not like before, but more of as a friend, and you wish that you two could still be that.<br>  <br>  Do Not Lie, Itll Only Make The Situation Worsen.|`|zFvy4V43aa	Mmmm...this is kina actually very difficult...<br>  you can telll her that if u 2 be bak in a relationship <br>  there might be lots of problems like last time<br>  it's kinda weird how u don't wanna b wiv her but u still care for her<br>  try makin her think that she deserves a better person<br>  than u or something like that??|`|Cyg3exYdaa	just say im sorry but i moved on give her a kiss and walk away|`|Sn4zj9T3aa	Just tell her you are not interested, and that you don't want to see her anymore. If you keep seeing her while she waits for your answer, you'll be stringing her along and using her. She will be mad, yes, but just let it go.

OHfZFR31aa	I think that most couples should be encouraged (not legally required) to go through some sort of pre-marriage counseling. Study after study have proven that people who do pre-marriage counseling, whether religiously-based or not, have lower divorce rates than those who don't. But I do not agree that people should be legally required to attend. And I think that people should be free to get out of a bad marriage quickly, especially if there is abuse (emotional or physical) or infidelity involved.<br>  <br>  Considering the states with the highest percentage of regular church goers are also those with the highest divorce rates, and born-again Christians have higher divorce rates than any other religion, I don't think things like covenant marriages will make any difference<br>  <a href="http://www.adherents.com/largecom/baptist_divorce.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adherents.com/largecom/baptis...</a><br>  <br>  "The highest divorce rates are in the Bible Belt: "Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma round out the Top Five in frequency of divorce...the divorce rates in these conservative states are roughly 50 percent above the national average" of 4.2/1000 people."<br>  <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/atheistfamiliesmarriage/a/AtheistsDivorce.htm" rel="nofollow">http://atheism.about.com/od/atheistfamil...</a>|`|muTZeGOgaa	1. Those were not our wedding vows. We had a civil wedding at a court house. There was no mention of God (nor would I allow there to be seeing as how we are both atheist.<br>  <br>  2. I would never agree to such a marriage. I like the idea that marriage is what YOU make of it, and no one has the right to tell you and your spouse how to live your lives, and if (or when) you've had enough of a bad situation. <br>  <br>  Frankly, I don't see the big deal about divorce rates. Seriously, 50% of all marriage end in divorce. Boo-hoo. Who is this hurting? Does the fact that 3 states away from you, Mary and John Smith's marriage failed really effect you in any way?<br>  <br>  In the end, I can't imagine being trapped in a marriage out of "obligation," nor would I want to stay married to someone who really didn't want to be married to me anymore.<br>  <br>  I LIKE my marriage as a legal contract. I'd have nothing to do with that "covenant" crap.|`|AA10727113	People take marriage so lightly thinking that they can simply divorce the person and write it off as a mistake.  This idea might not be perfect but its a start.|`|djUMvICoaa	Once trapped what are you going to do?  Sounds like a good deal for the man, must have been passed by men.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes - then maybe people would not be marrying the wrong person.  Hubby and I learned from bad first marriages and we consider ours to be a covenant marriage even if it was not officially that way.<br>  <br>  Divorce should only be for adultery, abuse or abandonment.|`|bO2rzfISaa	We worked our way up to no fault divorce because fault was so unwieldy. <br>  <br>  This sounds to me like religion creeping into government. <br>  <br>  As a religious person, you may conduct your marriage any way you like. Unfortnately, Fundamentalist Christians still divorce at a rate of about 40%, not much lower than the national average. Your beliefs don't really help you stay married now, I don't see how changing the law will help.

Next, go find some of your friends, and hang out, do the whole male bonding thing, and don't talk about her.  Then, just try to settle into a routine, and everything will be ok in the end.

zW8tc64qaa	Don't give in. Let her know that she has a good thing going for her. If she wats to go that easily, maybe she isn't the one for you man. It hurts to hear it, but its true. If she is willing to like someone so quickly, maybe she needs to reconsider some things, and so do you. Do you really want to be involved with a girl who is so quick to move on to someone else while she is with you? Think about it....|`|XhS1dDj1aa	mi girl friend likes so many other guys and i dont give a **** because im the one thats with her i really do love her and she tells me that she really feels loved by me so where still in love.and when she does tell me that she likes some other guy i ask her if shes gona break up with me she says she likes the other guys but she loves me|`|hnFFodXgaa	Opposites attract you know.....Anyways, If you have been dating for that long and she feels like she can just say she likes another guy on a whim, thats pretty ffed up, she needs to choose whether she wants you or him. Tell her to choose.|`|dsuXOaRraa	Sounds like the old 'opposites attract' thing.<br>  Being atheist isn't something to count against him.<br>  <br>  But drugs, yea I would have to say that's bad.<br>  <br>  Just talk to her and tell her you're scared of losing her, and that you really like her / love her (ONLY SAY LOVE IF YOU DO). Talk seriously so she knows your feelings. Goodluck :)|`|X5Fq3mOraa	Oh boy, thats a hard one,<br>  First off you absolutely NEED to talk to your girlfriend about this more than anything, ask her about him, about your relationship, anything you can do to save it, etc.  Tell her you love her and dont want to be with anyone else.  <br>  What you shouldn't do is kick the guy's ***, it may be tempting, and will feel amazing, but if your girl actually likes him it may p*** her off and end what you have worked so hard for.<br>  If she dumps you, then kick his ***.|`|igrdohopaa	Don't let her go. Tell her your the one.|`|h32OwXACaa	tell her to stop talking to him. If she likes him then tell her to get lost. Its not a good thing if you gf has her attention somewhere else. You're going to have to make a choice if she can't choose you of him
xoXkHOVsaa	I think it's best to cut it off now, rather than leading him to believe you like him.  Send him an e-mail telling him how you feel.  If he keeps sending you e-mails, then block him.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Just be honest- it's always the best solution.|`|njWh5Kobaa	I think you should just explain to him that you only see him as a friend , and do it the nicest way you can. And then if he still doesn't stop, then you cut contact with him.|`|L4jMOVvPaa	doing whats right for you doesnt make you a bad person. if the benifits fairly out weigh the down sides then do it. there is many others he will come incontact with over the years and hes probly just lached on to you.|`|1mHRVG5Jaa	No I think thats mean... you should just confront your feelings to him, he should understand :) x|`|HUY49TmEaa	No no no ur not a bad person.......|`|9jiHvzg7aa	i think you should just tell him that you don't like him like that<br>  instead of ignoring him.<br>  of course he will be a little hurt but its the truth.<br>  if you tell him he will stop.|`|kau1P97Kaa	your not a mean person your just being honest, just tell the guy you just want to be friends, be nice about it and don't try and hurt his feelings|`|qRJztNNZaa	i think thats wrong but if u really wanted to  it would be ok but it depends if hes sensitive. i would say that u dshould just state that u wanna be just his friend in a  nice way so it wont hurt him|`|ghWyyXYXaa	na ur a good person...|`|h5ghD3Zxaa	Recently I have been in the same situation and it really turned my world upside down. The guy continued to call and call, wanting to talk and whatnot. The only way that I was able to get him to stop contacting me was to actually tell him how I felt.<br>  <br>  I think that you should do what I did to solve my problem. It would hit home with more of an effect if you type the message out and send it to him, because it is harder to say things to people face-to-face. <br>  <br>  You should not feel bad because it is your life and you choose who you want to be with. If there is a guy who is too clueless to take a hint, then it is best if he finds out with the whole answer key. Bad metaphor, sorry. <br>  <br>  But good luck; I hope my plan works for you as it did me.
mMBPOjbFaa	attracted to just means you think they lookin good in the hood <br>  in love means you think they are beautiful inside and out :)|`|sLmX4H3Caa	Attraction is skin deep. Love goes all the way to the bone.|`|uJNrsYpqaa	attracted 2 means they just think ur pretyy/hot<br>  in love means u wanna spend the rest of ur life with that person|`|adL8Qm7yaa	attract=ur smokin hot<br>  love=i cant live without u or ill die for u|`|yt2zVOZfaa	People can be attractive and you can be attracted to them, but not necessarily in love. For example, celebrities. They are some of the most attractive people, but not everyone is in love with them.|`|2tn8EALqaa	Uh, you can be attracted to a celebrity but that doesn't mean you are IN LOVE with them...!!|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Attraction can mean anything from eye candy to anything that is pleasing to the eye. It does not always pertain to a long last emotion, feeling or will survive a test of time. Remember the medias standard of beauty changes quickly and often. LOve usually refers to an emotional state of attachment to a state of being. For instance I love kittens and puppies however I do not get emotional dependent on seeing things for  only pleasure. <br>   I like to see pretty girls walk by ( I am Human) however that is and attraction and i am not depended on it.<br>  I love to see my wife  all the time (I am a loving husband dedicated to her) and I am dependent on her. For an emotional state of my well being.

So just ask her, is all i'm saying.|`|lIEfSPfDaa	dude jus tell her stright up your atracted to her. quit being a vagine.
IPpOd2wmaa	could be a lot of things.
0ktcvglRaa	It sounds like he's totally into you!|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, he likes you and it looks like he is shy.  Try flirting with him and it will increase his self confidence to ask you out.|`|w7vgsK89aa	I think so. Just ask HIM for his honest opinion. It was hard for me to ask a girl...... but.... it paid off. We are now BF GF. Just ask!!!!! Tell me how it goes!!! :D|`|596N0bRXaa	yes he does becoz if he doesn't he would try to aviod you.|`|HnCUC1YIaa	its hard to say. if a guy likes you he plays with his hands alot when he is with you and he will brag in front of you.<br>  <br>  but, he also might just be doing this to keep you liking him. everyone likes the feeling of someone liking them|`|UpWNbeQvaa	He totally could be!

And most shy people respond very well to people that make the first move. <br>  <br>  Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. <br>  And what's the worst that she could say? No? What human being says no to another saying hello? LOL <br>  <br>  But anyway, then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet. And you can see where things go from there! =]|`|k2L2GP3Xaa	You've already broken the ice.  You've gotten her to giggle, she's smiled at you so it's safe to say she is  open.  On the back of your cheque stub, jot her a note with your name, phone number/email addy or something.

FSruw622aa	What's in your league is really something different for every guy and girl.  What's in your league is really anyone that you think you'd have a chance with.  What's out of your league is someone you feel that if you tried to pursue a relationship, they'd just laugh at you.  But out of your league could be economic class, age, outgoing(and you are shy), etc.|`|dyV5gDx3aa	You are a tool if you have the balls to feel the need to "maintain" this "social circle". Instead of worrying so much about whats cool and ****, why dont you go and meet people you can relate too and feel more comfortable with. The cool people arent always the best.

AA10250756	Yes, he rejected you before he knew you-you had your bff ask him too soon. Now he is testing the waters because he knows she told you he wasn't interested. He's not sure himself and he knows if he asks you out and it doesn't work out, he loses a friend. Give him lots of time to make up his mind and be receptive to going out with other guys. Nothing like seeing a girl with another guy to make a guy realize he wants to be the guy dating her.|`|V5AliBPMaa	Guys are just like that, it doesn't mean he likes you.

nmQZIYutaa	He didn't reject you because he did not know you. He was being honest saying no because he did not know you. Now that he knows you he is becoming very friendly. Maybe he does like you maybe he is just being friendly and your looking too much into it. Ask him to hang out solo outside of school. Good luck.
gO9tl2uhaa	When I'm in a relationship, I try to not let it affect my relationship too much. Well, the bad side of my temperament only; the good side is never a bad thing.<br>  <br>  But yeah. I'll tell my girl "I should tell you right now, I've been having a bad day today and am really moody" or "sorry if I'm on the mood, I'm really exhausted today". You know, just a simple heads up. <br>  <br>  However, it doesn't happen much. So I guess my answer would be: not that much! (I know, I know. Should've said that from the start. Just felt like making you read too much text for nothing =P )|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Everyone's different, we're all raised differently, we have different views on subjects, different reactions, a lot of our nature comes from what our parents instilled in us.  I think with any relationship, it really shows a new part of yourself - new lessons in compromise, how truly stubborn you are, how far you'd be willing to go for a loved one (and not somebody you love, but someone you're in love with.)|`|2RAvyY0naa	The same way anything else would: It is all relative.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally, I am compatible with virtually everyone I know, but very distanced.|`|U8sTUqY4aa	DAMN YOU ROGER, DAMN YOU ROGER|`|iztUsnpqaa	Temperament...?Hmmmm , since this question was addressed to each and every individual on here , I will answer it from my point of view.I do not have a temperament ..In fact..No matter what my fiancee does it can never upset me ..how could it?!

igrdohopaa	Def abortion!|`|WMR8hVlfaa	What's wrong with either? <br>  <br>  Sex work is legal in many countries. Just because the U.S. has antiquated puritan views on it doesn't make something bad. <br>  <br>  And an abortion is an awful thing to go through, but for many women it is necessary. Would you rather a child be brought onto this earth who will live a life of neglect and abuse? Because most babies given up for adoption don't end up in permanent homes, especially if they're not white.|`|fkchpcHJaa	making a prostitute abort ur baby|`|SfUOWfp5aa	both|`|wXyoo8mNaa	flip a coin|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Abortion is by far worse.|`|AA11307468	Having sex with a prostitute is worse because you are willingly jumping into risky behavior.  You don't know the prostitute's sexual health history.  You only have her word to go on.  And condoms don't provide protection from all STIs.<br>  <br>  I would rather see a woman get an abortion than give birth to another unwanted, uncared for child.  There are too many in this world as it is.  And honestly, I am one who would have an abortion should I get pregnant.

AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	definately.,,,,!! check out hos body language around u,,,,which wl make u more sure about his feelings towards u!|`|wFGwP939aa	sounds like he want to see if you smell like fish or not. i dont know if he like you or not but i am sure when he gets done you can get back to playing with your dolls|`|AA11317789	Yes, it does. It totally does. He's showing all the signs of wanting to be closer to you.|`|QPdYQeUkaa	No...he just wants to get you naked and bang you.|`|D73AArwoaa	yea
h9fKoHGyaa	Don't tell her. She probably wouldn't believe you, and think that you made it all up. She would probably think you're jealous of them, too. I would stay out of it, and when she tells you he broke up with her, just hug her and ask her to hang out. But whatever you do, don't lead her boyfriend into thinking you like him, then date him. That would be the worst thing you could do.|`|SBpl494Uaa	Just stay out of it, and in the future when people want to tell you stuff like this just say you dont want to hear it. What good does it do you to involve yourself in other peoples business?|`|QAc9LoVzaa	Girls before guys. Tell her. Get her to end it with him.|`|0SREhTB2aa	Tell your guyfriend that you don't want to listen to anything to do with your best friend anymore. That will stop you from stressing out about it.<br>  Also advise him to talk to his girlfriend about the whole situation, rather than you.<br>  Does your bestfriend know that you chat to her boyfriend?<br>  If she didn't know then of course she'd be fuming but if she did, you can tell her to be catious about him.<br>  Good luck x|`|JJARLh3zaa	i think you should be honest with her, even though it hurts. if she finds out that you knew about it before she did then she might suspect something between you and your friend, and it might ruin your friendship.<br>  <br>  good luck with whatever you decide|`|tzwPcqk6aa	dont make pacs u cant ever insure any one that u will always be able to tell them the truth.|`|sUb69Cdzaa	i literally JUST had this happen. you should tell your friend. BUT tell her that she CANNOT tell him she knows, because she wasn't supposed to. she really should know about it. as long as she doesn't go to him after you tell her, it should be okay. hope i could help out
8XKmMBU7aa	Yes your space in his relationship is just having sex.<br>  If he had made you cry all the time, It's so bad. I'm really sorry for that please. I think he can't understand you and only have desire to make sex and after having sex, he will make you more cry and will definite leave you. Please I can't make you happy but only can try, Don't care and forget all. You had a bad dream and it's finished. Now your relationships are with your future not with his sexy thought or with his holidays. Please you may say him after bowing your head on his foot that you can't live without him and please forgive me. when ever you will say i will make hot sex without getting marry or before getting marry any time.  please sorry, Truth is bitter than a lie. Don't mind if i had told you some thing wrong, you had need to forgive him. you don't have need to say him any thing nor need to send him any message. He may die any where. don't think and be Relax. try to make god your best friend or you are also best friend of yourself.<br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|AA11071040	Tell him you need a break.  He should not be making you feel guilty that you don't want to go farther.  Is this the kind of guy you really want to be with?|`|hnFFodXgaa	He's being pretty inconsiderate. You need your space, tell him that. If he doesnt like it well screw him. Stuff like that is really serious.|`|X4i2jej5aa	I think you should tell him how you really feel, that you had an abusive past and every time you guys get intimate, you feel like its all coming back to you. Tell him that you are not ready to do it yet, and that if he doesn't try to understand, break up with him. He's really not worth it, someone like you can do sooooo much better than him, I know that for sure. Communication is very important, and he should have considered your feelings first. You did the right thing, telling him to stop. Just talk it out with him and if you think he's not worth, chances are, you're right.
de7c6ed9dcbcae2c74de88cb77ff340baa	This happened to me also.<br>  next time you ask her to hang out if she says she cant<br>  tell her how you feel just be like i feel that you have no time for me anymore ever since you have been dating "alex" and are friendship is getting farther apart and i dont want that to happen. if she still dosnt understand then she isint worth your time.|`|PWFFto2Paa	My best friend Vanessa is the same way. What you should do is just start hanging out with your other friends more often. If she was a real friend she wouldn't do that. Maybe go find a boyfriend of your own?
9a506c84f370dbf2fecea59b04578a36aa	it seems to me that your basing all of these inferences off the way he looks. you guys have been having this chemistry for a year and you both clearly still like eachother- if he was some flake then he would have given up on you by now! it's always worth giving a shot- i mean just look at what's in front of you: an attractive guy that you like that likes you back- think of all the woman who would kill for a chance like that! give it a shot and see where it goes! you really have no idea until you do...|`|pNqjsJn7aa	just give it a shot..u neva know..u guys might just click..alll d v best!|`|QwlFEYicaa	Hi Dan,<br>  I think you should give it a shot, as you mentioned that even you are interested. Maybe if you go out couple of times with him and when you both get to talk and exchange you opinions and ideas who would know how far this relation could go.<br>  Hey, I'm also and Indian woman, divorced in my late 20s', dating a white-man at work who is also divorced, in his late 40s'. He actually mentioned to me that he likes me and we started going out. Its been just a month, so far so good.I'm hoping for the same like you do -  for a stable relationship. I think after all thats what Indian woman look forward to! I am sailing in the same boat like you!<br>  I really wish you good luck and would like to know of your progress.|`|9DYcAlGhaa	Hi Dan,<br>  <br>  He could be a really nice guy, who knows? but if this has been going on for a year then I'd say give him a try - he seems keen consistently. Good luck with that.
AA11493831	It can be enough. If they deeply love each other. <br>  <br>  But the 2 most important things are trust and communication, specially in cases like that.<br>  <br>  Love and strong attraction can be important too, but at times it's not enough to make a relationship last. <br>  <br>  It's a matter of combining the above-mentioned things to make it work and last a lifetime.|`|tMON93tnaa	Trust and communication are some of the most important :D|`|IUw0f5u5aa	If your partner can make you laugh, is kind and your heart thumps every time you see him, then your marriage may last as long as mine has, thirty nine years.   The rest is up to "LUCK", and I really believe that.|`|8e3dYsoVaa	I guess you have already received enough answers. Respect, trust, communication, lots of love & attention is very important. I am a south indian girl in relationship with an english man. And yes, cultural differences can be good or difficult. He found my culture interesting & I find him sweet & caring. We are first of all good friends to one another. I know he will not leave me for anything in this world. I trust him & hope to make a great family to last forever.|`|JJARLh3zaa	if you love someone, then things will work out. but people don't seem to know what true love is these days. and for it to work out, both of you have to feel the same way|`|QwlFEYicaa	I would say it depends on the person's way of thinking. I believe there are some white men out there who really value the cultural differences.|`|3e5jzj1Raa	No, thats how it starts. You must be great friends,because that is how it will finish up|`|cUO2zYsnaa	Truly, you can love the person as much as the world and compliment them so much that you would run out of compliments. But listen, if they dont have the interest in you, the relationship wont work. A relationship is mutual, two people. If one doesnt like it, then how will the relationship go on? It would have to end. So just hold her tight, (not literally) and make sure that you shine your personality and do everything to please her/his needs.|`|73GkepzFaa	Trust, communication, loyalty/honesty. Love and good looks can only do so much in a relationship. If it grows into all categories it's possible to last a lifetime, but it just depends on the two people and what they want/like/etc. Good luck~|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	no, it is not, what makes a relationship last is hard work from both partners, and a lot of communication, trust, and friendship etc but those are the 3 main ones,|`|yLPZ7gkkaa	gobble gobble turkey thighs|`|AA10193030	trusting eachother careing and loving being there eachother talking about how u feel and  what going in your life and at work then yes it should wokr out wit you both
comuT2fkaa	if he brings a friend then why not you bring<br>  a friend too?<br>  that way, maybe your friend and his friend <br>  can hang while you and your crush are together.|`|QlvcSgn0aa	shes got a good point. And there is always next time.
lMKy9Ho8aa	a true gentleman!! <br>  someone who is respectful, caring, good listener, and hygenically intact!!|`|JXrvbW7caa	I will usually notice if he's tall or not and if he has a nice body.|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	his body..nd his looks gotta be sexii|`|UuCblv3Caa	Evrything from the head.|`|27af90e0f6dfc8baff90052bd5ee1e76aa	well, the most impportant things to me are his personality, his brain, and respect. unfortunately, before i can find all that out, i gotta get past his look. so i guess the first thing is look, body, lips... but once i get to know the person, the look probably won't matter no more.|`|cHiv6eTWaa	I usually am attracted to the eyes first and it seems I like the tall dark and handsome type. If a guy has yucky teeth I won't go anywhere near him because that's nasty. I like a guy that appears self confident but not to cocky and full of himself.|`|1wWSzEAOaa	eyes|`|J77NbCXBaa	I look at his overall appearance. His clothes, hair, eyes and so on.  I don't feel uncomfortable if a guy was to approach me unless he was all over me or feeding me some stupid line or even by the way he walks over (like if he came up to me with a "player" walk). <br>  <br>  But besides appearances, for me to actually like the guy I have to love his personality first! If I love the personality, then the he starts to look even better in my eyes.|`|sXVkRGJIaa	There are a lot of things I look for in a guy but the FIRST thing that catches my attention is style. <br>  If you see someone dressed hot and sexy and a lil bit different and you see someone with plain jeans and a hoody your going to be attracted more so to the first one.<br>  Next thing I see is confidence. Someone who walks with his head up and back straight is going to catch my attention more than someone who walks with head sown slumped !<br>  & the second part<br>  I would feel uncomfortable if a guy a lot older than me came over and started flirting with me (obviously lol) I like a guy who approaches me who is confident yet not cocky and is respectful if you know what I mean? ...So ya !<br>  Also nice eyes and a good smile is a big plus !|`|q3NE8KI1aa	ummmmmmmmmmm.. well.. since girls are so vain.. of course it's the physical features.. what I hate when a guy comes up to me is.. well if they get to close.. like up in my face close.. it's like DUDE! chill.. give me some space.. .. or when they over talk after I've said no or Im not interested.. and then they start to beg.. (which is a major turn off!) then I'd get all freaked out.. anyway blah.. im just talking  about nothing.. <br>  <br>  hope you get your answer though :P|`|Qz4n1l0zaa	I guess body language. I need to detect if he's genuine or if he's putting up a front and acting fake. I try to detect arrogance and cockiness. I tolerate neither! This is only when I'm looking at them to see if I'd like to be more than friends with them.|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	well i look at how the guy dresses then after i like the way he dresses i look at his personality and the way he is towards me.i like it when a guy hugs me and shows me alot of attention|`|EEapXFJ2aa	his clothes.. his hair.. his face... his personality.. the way he talks.. what he talks about.... his shoes... his frends..  n so on.. this is the sequence<br>  when i know him then i keep in mind how famous he is... his car.. how he drives... etc.|`|dat8eoYyaa	beautiful eyes, if someone where to approach me that i didn't know and they have sweet manner and not someone who came of cocky or arrogant but genuine , very cool would make me very happy :)|`|LbzQtQb9aa	it doesnt matter as long as he is respectful, a non party pooper, treats me right, and faithful.....also funny|`|BTTFVbYYaa	nice personality and I do like long legs on a man. i find them sexy and a nice back.|`|nVcPB89gaa	safe feeling|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I always go for the teeth and the eyes. I don't know why.|`|pW8Kv4GGaa	His eyes and also if he is funny :)|`|W3bELVbmaa	I like them to have dark hair, a grey-hound figure (so tall and slim basically) and I'm not bothered about eyes.<br>  He has to be fun, kind and NOT have a big ego, a big ego is the worse thing in the world.<br>  and if a guy comes up to me for the first time, it makes me uncomfortable if they try to kiss me straight away. it makes me happy when they make me laugh and have good conversation :).<br>  <br>  x|`|qsbhdi1raa	Okay when i first look at a guy, i go straight to noticing his swagger (how he carries himself) and if that is all good, i start to notice his body. <br>  When a guy that i don't know approached me, he can't be too close. It make me uncomfortable, but if he's about a good foot away and looks really interested i'm like hey!! ha ha i hope that helps!!|`|vzEUP1fdaa	body language.. Just seeing that he's confident is really hott. Approaching: creeped out is when you lean too close and say something disrespectful, or cheesy. Happy to meet you is when you give us a little space and say something that makes us laugh or compliment us on something that you can be sincere about. Because we can tell if you are being sincere or not. Also make eye contact..it shows us you're serious and it'll help you keep our interest.|`|dCURE6VQaa	body, mind and then soul. if u pass the first test ( Im really not that picky) then i see if your thinking about anything important in the world and then i try to see if your a person with a warm or cold heart and what u like/dislike. All together it takes me about a month if im interested in you. otherwise your just another guy....|`|BJXPRQVsaa	- style<br>  <br>  i tend to go for guys with the edgy look.<br>  they dont have to be the most good looking but with the right outfit and that certain edge; they attract me.<br>  <br>  oh! i dont like guys being sleazy and trying to get my number.<br>  <br>  - i had one guy come upto me while i was out clubbing, and he said i just want to tell you your absolutely stunning and kissed me hand and walked off; i then bumped into him that same night and now we are best friends :)<br>  <br>  xx|`|jKMWDZcaaa	I'm trying to stop doing this so much but, looks are one of the first things I look for. Then his smile. He has to have a pretty smile.<br>  <br>  The only thing that can make me uncomfortable about a guy's approach to me would be if he's being overly persistence or touchy feely right off the bat. Other wise, I would welcome subtle new guys.|`|AA11611751	eyes and face.  I like clear smooth skin so if a guy has a lot of acne I get pretty turned off immediately.  Also i like someone with high energy who does a lot of sports an is athletic so obviously if hes huge he's not active enough for me and that would turn me away as well.|`|ChmuSKpVaa	smile, and hair. Body Language, if he is confident in his self. When a guy approaches me, i like for him to be flirty. But i dont like when they come up and already think that i am going to be into them.|`|HmLA6pCHaa	In terms of looks?  The eyes.  They are definitely windows to the soul.  <br>  <br>  And when an unknown guy approaches me, body language and the way he walks is a scare or not factor.  ;D|`|naEk1QkSaa	his eyes and hair!<br>  <br>  non physical = funny, nice, and charming!|`|lHfiz2xOaa	Physical(first thing i see). then personality.|`|X3Su9Mrjaa	is the the way he looks and the way he dresses|`|Jhr68T0baa	smile, sense of humour and shoulders and arms.|`|8944f73c833621471e9e11c26282ce5aaa	he has to be sweet..and hot :] but still..i'm open to any guy who's funny and sensitive..they have to trust me|`|jXnpJM0Oaa	His broad shoulders and chest, his butt, and his, uh...package. heehee.  It's true though.  Oh, and nice legs too.  Oh, and big hands.  Body language:  a guy who walks confidently.  Face:  I like nice lips, and eyes.  Uncomfortable:  leers.  When he approaches he should have a smile on his face.  No long stares on boobs or butt.  Be friendly and talk.  If you're interested, show you are by asking questions, and throw in a little compliment.  If it's there, chemistry will pick up from there.  If it's not there, it won't, and move on.|`|1alUsemJaa	eyes and smile are the physical features i admire most about a guy, and as far as meeting some one new, i like it when a guy is confident, not cocky, and has a sense of humor, i my self enjoy all types of humor but you may want to hold back on the dirty/racist/religious jokes until you know the person better you could offend her. Oh and compliments, but not like "Hey, nice rack" but like  "Has any one told you, you have the most enchanting eyes" (but don't make a false compliment) LYING IS A NO NO be yourself and don't try too hard to impress a lady, honesty is the best policy!<br>  <br>  Hope i help!|`|H58JbpPNaa	The first thing i look for is their eyes and their body language to see if they're a nice guy or not.Well, if a guy i don't know approaches me the only thing that makes me uncomfortable is that they ask me all sorts of questions that i don't want to answer.|`|kEqM8oj3aa	Hey I'm a guy who has several girl friends.

And if they like the looks then they check personality. I've been told... good luck!|`|gKL9gOpqaa	I don't notice physical stuff that much first besides their hair and eyes. I talkto them then I feel happier and less uncomfortable if he's really nice and can make me laugh/smile.

ff545BLyaa	Too early is like before two months for me anyways... too late is apparently after 19 months, so my X says I just hate expressing my feeling in words its not me and if you don't like it go to hell....  If someone told me i love you before two months I would be creeped out!|`|oAPSJnSEaa	Too early is when you have been hanging out for less than 2 months -_- unless you've been attached at the hip every hour of every single day. Too late is when they have someone already or have moved to another country or if they are dead.|`|QAc9LoVzaa	Its never too late.<br>  And its actually never too early. Just depends on if the person you are saying it to feels it as well because if you say i love you and they haven't been with you long enough to be able to say it back, it will make them feel awkward and you feel embarrassed. <br>  You just have to try and read them to see how they would handle it.<br>  Good Luck.|`|iJlqUY4jaa	id say it as soon as you are ready and truly love that person. i remember one of my best friends has a boyfriend who was diagnosed with leukemia when we were 14. they had been dating since grade 7, and had been pretty serious with each other. so, he had leukemia for about 2 years, and he stopped responding to treatment. so when this happened, he only had about 3 months to live.  so when my friend went to see him in the hospital, she told him for the first time that she loved him very much.  he said the same thing back. And guess what? he started getting stronger and started responding again. now he is super healthy, straight A student and is captain of the basketball team at r skool.|`|SEyRe6Eaaa	It's too late when they are married or gone out of your life for good. It's too early when you feel that once you tell them they'll think you are a stalker.|`|XeLZtw20aa	you want to do it when you actually get into each other and are hanging out more often|`|PK2zFKmcaa	Any time is appropriate. When you feel its right, not a matter of time. There should be no rule saying one month into a relationship you're allowed to say it, but when you feel it's the right time to do so. I love you is a matter of personal comfort not going with what other people say is right for you.|`|b9t7U7Ugaa	To my point of view i think its never too early to say I LOVE YOU from you love the person and the person love you back its just the right time.|`|8NvIh3Rtaa	will if a guy says i love u u should say i love u to but if he doesnt then u shount say i love u|`|1eYUof7zaa	id say if you were older than 15 you would kno if you were in love...and its never to late !! love last a life time|`|oB1WQJHgaa	my bf told me i love you at 1 week. it has been a year now and we are great. i didnt say it back till like 2 months... :)|`|sCbNP39daa	it depends how old u are... but under 20... at least a month to 2
nxEoR9CEaa	Before or after you tried to see if she was wearing panties?|`|4LrMwuVuaa	i've been in this situation, and i've never told a woman that her fly was down.  a zipper down is usually not obvious, and i wouldn't want her to think i was looking down there.  i'd be more inclined to tell a woman her skirt was stuck inside her pants, as that's much more obvious.  as far as something between her teeth - probably.|`|ina2jZ5Saa	she'll probably get offended, and especially DO NOT tell a girl if her zipper is down, cuz then she'll feel like you were looking "down there" and you'll make her feel uneasy. Leave this stuff for the girls to tell the girls...because having a guy tell us one of these things, can be kind of inappropiate and offending.|`|jXnpJM0Oaa	lol...her pants stuck between her putt??  you mean, p****?  Hillarious.  No, you shouldn't tell her.  I would tell another woman if I saw her zipper was down, but not another guy unless it was a friend.  Food between the teeth is OK.  I would want to know.|`|C0qL6tgCaa	Haha, I told a woman that her skirt was tucked in to her knickers when she was shopping - I felt bad for her because everyone was laughing.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Heck no I wouldn't tell a complete stranger that. I would just let that person find out on their own.
V8yrrQlsaa	You'll eventually get over this. Next time tell him your not interested and that he's broken your heart twice already and your looking for somebody who doesn't tease you.<br>  <br>  Go out and do something, get away from guys and maybe focus on yourself, go shopping, or go to the beach for a weekend with your friends, read a book. He's winning this battle, it's time to move on. If you still think about him after a month than you'll never get over him.|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	pay for a male gigolo|`|5687JygEaa	I know its hard, I still at times tend to cry for my ex, and even if I am busy all the time, I still think of him. The only advice that I could give you is to find yourself. what I mean by this is that you should start exploring your wants, your needs, your interests. Hang out with people (even though you dont want to), you have to force yourself to start doing something. Working out helps me alot, and focusing on other things. I'm not saying you should go out there and start dating, or flirt with other guys or to just get over it. It takes time and you shouldn't put yourself out there when you're not ready. I really don't know what else to say since I'm sort of in the same thing, but I do wish you the best of luck with that.<br>  <br>  plz answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhJM6cPUQOFN6FI0BiyBBa_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307085443AAg8qJv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AXXDyKecaa	stay occupied, eat icecream or chocolate, and realize that there's a lot more guys to come!
kTvn2Nltaa	well i don't know how you can feel better about them, i just wanted to say that if he is a really good guy, then something small like that won't bother him. try and stop worrying about it so much and maybe even tell him that you are self conscious about them. like i said, if he is the good guy you say he is, he won't let something this little bother your relationship.|`|q8S2h4ltaa	ok so i can totally see where your comin from.<br>  i have excema and have terrible scars all over my arms and legs i always wear long sleeves and jeans cuz i feel bad about it. and i have a boyfriend who understands how i feel and is supportive of me and doesnt care what my skin looks like.<br>  however iif you guys have been together a year im sure yor relationship is strong enough where he will understand your insecurites and accept you anyways...if he doesnt and is insensitive to you drop him cuz you'll find someone who loves you for whats inside not out|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Just quit worrying about the stretch marks. I was divorced with 3 kids and the stretch marks have never been a problem.|`|ycVNo3lRaa	Dont worry about it.  Ive got stretch marks on mine and not one guy has ever commented on them (they're too busy drooling!) So dont worry about it at all and have fun xxx|`|wjE12DgKaa	Well all i can say is that i sort of know were your coming from, i have them on my stomach and i have a scar on my belly Button from surgery. When me and my boyfriend are together and he tries to lift my shirt up i instantly react. Just try and tell him that they bother you and he should understand, and like you said im sure he wont even notice them, it such a normal thing to have, and if you want get some vitamin E gel pills and burst them in your hands every night and rub it onto the marks. Eventually they should fade and if you want he could even do it for you when you get comfortable with it.|`|5KAznBR0aa	Get a Product called Bio-oil. Its very effective at treating stretch marks on soft skin - such as the chest. <br>  You can buy it from any health shop or pharmacy, and also on the internet. Please dont allow your self-esteem to be affected by this, Its natural and Bio-oil can help to return the skin back to its natural look. <br>  <br>  One thing to note is that Bio-oil isnt a miracle oil, it works after  few weeks of repeatedly applying it, so try it and be patient. Hope i helped :)|`|AA11071040	The only way you are going to know for sure how he feels about them is to show him.  If he has been with you for over a year, he likes you for you and it won't matter to him that you have some stretch marks.  If you are really that self conscious about it, only take your shirt off when the room is dark.  Don't feel bad about not wanting to wear low cut shirts, why would you want strangers to see your body anyway?|`|0dO3z3XKaa	Honey, we all have flaws including him.  Just don't wear low cut shirts! There are plenty of adorable shirts you can wear.<br>  <br>  The sexiest woman in the world is one who has confidence in herself and accepts herself.  He's been with you a year, he obviously is digging you. Put the self doubt away and focus on just having fun, enjoying life!|`|03rggPF2aa	he wont care. stretch marks mean your boobs got bigger. and the will fade away eventually. most likely he wont even notice and if he does tell them its because they grew. he wont be complaining about that.|`|wX46Gv4naa	If you know he won't care then neither should you|`|GprW2fmZaa	Nike, "Just do it!"|`|7YTiooX5aa	In order for you to be comfortable with him seeing them is for you to get comfortable with yourself. I had the same problem except with me I had a hernia and well let's just say it lowered my self esteem tremendously!!! Anyway eventually I got over it and realized that although men love to look at our bodies all men are different and have certain things that really don't matter to them as long as the person that they are with is the one they want. I have since had my hernia repaired and it has left a nasty looking scar but at the same time I am already okay with it and now I just don't pay attention to it. Try to just start spending an hour a day looking at yourself in the mirror and while you are tell yourself you are beautiful and then after awhile you will no longer feel self cautious. Hope this has helped|`|uWJJyNR3aa	Don't worry. Almost Everyone has stretchmarks all over their body. You know this. We know this. And I'm pretty sure your boyfriend knows this. Just know, no one's perfect and it's those imperections that probably draw your boyfriend to you.<br>  <br>  and if you really can't take it, try concealer... or bio oil.
HMzUeqTmaa	honestly i know how you feel, i was badly over weight, but i started to go the gym and play for my schools tennis team its helped a lot. Ive lost 47lbs in a little more than 6 months. I had no self confidence, but i just started to ignore what everyone was saying and it actually built some up.

Look at that thing you are looking for! And Grab it! You only live once, and for weight! That is just up to you, are you gonna stop eating snacks? Are you gonna eat right, are you gonna move, walk. Run? Pump it up a notch. :)|`|b13c3Znmaa	hey you never said whether you are male or female but that doesn't matter.  As you said you are 14 and you wanted to lose weight then because your probably still at school why don't you confide in your friends or maybe teachers or your parents, other than that my suggestion would be to forget the diet and go to your local gym and ask an instructor for a training program.  but whatever you do let someone know how you feel maybe even your doctor don't go threw this alone.  you may find yourself being pleasantly surprised.|`|B7idbFNVaa	Am trying to LOSE WEIGHT myself TOO.  I just RAN 5 MILES ALREADY.  It felt GREAT..<br>  <br>  Well, in order for you to have more CONFIDENCE, you have to SET GOAL that you can DO.. DON'T SET GOALS that is IMPOSSIBLE for you to DO that will only bring you DOWN.<br>  <br>  I don't know how tall you are so the 135 lbs is not very helpful.<br>  <br>  In order to be the "people person" you have to have a lot of FRIENDS or KNOW alot of people..  Start by trying to MAKE NEW FRIENDS once a MONTH or WEEK.  by the END of the YEARS the number of FRIENDS will STACK UP.  To me the QUALITY of FRIENDS are MORE IMPORTANT.  I like to hang around or know people who has SPECIAL TALENT.. they tend to be much more INTERESTING or the LIFE of SHOW.<br>  <br>  From the LOOKS of the PICTURE.. you still LOOKS YOUNG and LOOKS GREATS.. You just NEEDS to find others that can PUSH you HARDER or HELP you OVER COME you FLAWS or GOALS.

If he says no, what do you have to lose???|`|m6H5x02Kaa	the only way to get to know someone better is basically to ask them out. if that is his reasoning- i just dont understand it. and if he likes you so much he should be the one to ask you out. it sounds like you two would easily find a connection but he has to step up and quit making excuses for himself-easier said than done-i know|`|rqASGeevaa	I think he does like you otherwise he wouldn't always stare at your or talk about you. I'd say let a friendship build or at least some sort of connection between the two of you, as I once went out with a guy who stared at me and talked about me a lot and visa versa because we both liked eachother. We ended it in 2 days though. It got awkward and just didn't work out.|`|ZBWVBdAGaa	do not ask him out !he said he wanted to get to know you first instead ask him to go to the movies or go out for lunch as a FRIEND,so he gets to know you better^-^GOOD LUCK|`|kAX9xBmkaa	if he really likes you then wait till he asked you out. and  start talking to him more then you use to.|`|zZtAYBowaa	go ahead know each other!!!! and yeah somethings is always better than nothing right???& you might not regret afterwards!!!!u know what imean!!!!!|`|42tNVOUDaa	Get him to ask you out, it seems like he has it too easy.

I was blessed to have ever known such a wonderful person and in that scenario, I got to say goodbye.  But I had a husband that was killed suddenly, April 28, 1985.  I didn't get to have that sense of saying goodbye and my grief was much harder to get through.  That is why, everyday, I tell and show the people in my life, how much I love them.  There is always regret when you realize that you may not have said or done enough for the person you love.  Especially when he dies suddenly.  Live your life to the fullest and always share the love you have in your heart with everyone you love.  If we all did that than maybe the world would be a better place.|`|JIwbiE8kaa	Although its not a funny question, I find it extremely ironic that I read it as I sit in Iraq.

No bickering on the phone or in e-mail.  I made sure before I left to let her know what she means to me and I try every time we talk to reassure her that she is my best friend.  I would have no regrets...but thats because I've had a chance to say the things I've wanted to say.|`|FKMKQbqPaa	no regrets.  i make it a point to say what needs said every day.  i can't think of anything i should say that she doesnt know and that we havent talked about.|`|evJ2GEodaa	Sadly I would regret somethings.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	Regardless of what was or was not said in the past, my husband would know that I loved him fully and he always had my heart.|`|PREcj1STaa	I believe we all do but just in case yes i have regrets from every relationship I have been in . whether it was a minor regret or a major one|`|xNWqqlcYaa	ah i would totaly regret stop payment on her life insurance policy .|`|2YX18RE2aa	No regrets.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	No regrets.<br>  <br>  I'd be devastated to have him taken from me so abruptly.|`|zL1sggpCaa	I would regret trying to rush out of the house and not just going up stairs to give him a kiss.... instead, I yelled "have a good day, I love you!" while I ran out the door with the kids....<br>  <br>  I can't say I would regret saying anything in particular, because we're pretty open. He knows if something isn't right, or if something is bothering me - I used to keep everything bottled up and he is the one that got me to stop that.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	I'd regret every second of every minute of every hour of every day that was stolen from us.

Second, don't say I love you until you really mean it. It's stupid because those three words can mean so much, but they are used too frequently in places where they are undeserved. Anyway, I would say that you should just ask him questions about himself to get to know him better, and he will begin to ask you more about yourself. That way, if you do go out, you won't be complete strangers.

gO9tl2uhaa	I know the shallow feeling - felt it before. And you know what? It doesn't make you a jerk. It's not like you just had a one-night. If there isn't any attraction, you should NEVER force yourself in a relationship. It's not your fault if you aren't attracted to her.<br>  <br>  I think you should break up with her. And I know it's gonna suck but be honest. NOT "yeah, you're a bit too chubby". More something along "I think you're great, but I'm not attracted to you anymore and it's not something I control.

If you just do coffee, it almost turns into an interview and you can end up with A LOT of awkward pauses.  If you go to the movies, you don't get a chance to talk at all cause you're sitting in silence for 2 hours.<br>  <br>  I much prefer 'active' dates where you get to do something, but there is still the opportunity to chat.  Consider something like bowling or mini-golfing (around here, you can even do this indoors). Or, maybe something like a local concert or sporting event?|`|Qbczt3ivaa	You can try taking her to the park, the beach(for a walk if the weather is cold), ice skating, take her to the movies, and maybe you can go out somewhere to eat, but it doesnt have to be an expensive restaurant, just make sure you have fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *go easy on the $$$ and its really sweet if you pay for her, but thats if you want to extra nice :)|`|xfUNgn2Yaa	as a first date maybe something casual and fun, like an amusement park,.....iceskating,.......rollerskatin... it depends what she likes..XD|`|d3bBTjD2aa	movie, it is the least confrontational, you hardly have to talk, just make sure it is a good movie, and then she'll associate the fun time (cinematic experience) with you and you'll be on good terms and off to a good start|`|yJ1QYClQaa	something active like bowling or an amusement park. <br>  going to a movie is a bad idea because you can't talk. and dinner would be awkward unless you guys are really good friends.|`|Qwd0dLVzaa	My first date:<br>  We went to The Brass Armadillo, Sonic, Movies.<br>  'Twas really fun.|`|Va96He2Saa	Mcdonalds, and hey if your feeling really snazzy why not KFC|`|RJ4leJ1maa	It depends how old you are. if you are 14-16 I would recommend:<br>  A movie, or hanging out, go bowling, mini golf.<br>  If you are 17-20:<br>  A nice dinner, a drive in movie, bowling works too|`|vrfuO9Asaa	cinema and stuff like that.x
dFHsAXDMaa	My guess would be she is not in the least bit happily married although she my be working hard trying to make people believe she is...... seeing those things in a box from you brought back memories of all the lost when she walked out of your life. She is sitting there now wishing she had waited and trusted in your love for her.... because now she is married to one man and still in love with another..YOU|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I thought this was a repeat question too.  Stop trying to find someone to agree with you and move on.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If she didn't feel a need to reclaim her things, it's because they were of no value to her.  <br>  <br>  I suspect that you sending them to her parents a year later was perceived by her as an attack - a way to make her feel bad about herself and how she treated you.  <br>  <br>  You should have just thrown her stuff out.  If she'd wanted or needed it, she would have gotten it from you already.|`|mzYsk112aa	I think she might regret that she married the other guy.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	you already posted this question.<br>  <br>  here's a better question: why do YOU care that she's angry?<br>  <br>  move on.|`|Pr3QIlweaa	She's angry because, by receiving those items, she's reminded of her life with you, which then reminds her of how she hurt you, and she feels guilty about leaving you the way she did.  She may feel hurt that you didn't make any moves to marry her, as well...which is why she said she left.<br>  <br>  Seeing those items again re-opened that old wound for her.  She's deflecting.  She doesn't like being reminded of how she hurt you (or how she feels you hurt her), so she gets angry.  Anger is always a sign the person feels he/she is about to be hurt emotionally.  It's a protection mechanism.  Behave threateningly, so the source of the potential emotional harm will retreat.<br>  <br>  While I think it's rather childish for her to behave this way, I do understand it.  A more mature, "centered" person will not behave this way...but, then again, he/she wouldn't have left you the way your ex did, either.  Emotionally healthy people don't "dump" their partners, much less over the phone, or without a great deal of mature and sober discussion.<br>  <br>  (You earn your way out of relationships by being open and honest about your feelings and what you think is lacking.  You work at trying to resolve those things WITH your partner.  And, if you've done all that and still can't make it work, you part ways with no animosity...knowing it just wasn't meant to be.  Myself, I'm on -or would be on- friendly terms with every single man I've ever dated.  I would be happy to run into any one of them.  In fact, when I began daing my -now- husband, my recent ex-boyfriend used to accompany us on many occasions.  He was great.  My husband is fantastic.  I only dated men I respected.  That doesn't change because we didn't make a good couple.)|`|ucVgUcDvaa	I know someone has said .....Forget her. <br>  I say, She is, the worst, THE WORST kind of human there is. She is trash. FoR gEt her. Find someone else to dote on. You will get out of this rut if you try and want to. She does not love you.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	She clearly doesn't care about you anymore, so why do you care so much about why she's the way she is and why she does or did what she did. Move on. There are like 5 women to every man on earth and I'm certain you can find someone who will love and respect you and not play games and be childish.|`|ZKcg7YV8aa	She may just be upset because she realizes that she actually has feelings for you. I am not sure of course, but that is what it sounds like. You did not do anything wrong by mailing her things, so don't worry about that. <br>  I think she does have feelings for you, because otherwise she would not call you.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Maybe she was so jealous, she was conviced you were cheating on her when you were overseas.  Maybe so much, she believed it was true??  I dunno, just a theroy  <br>  <br>  Maybe you did something that you are not aware of?  You should ask, or you will be wondering for the rest of your life.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	why even give a rats *** about her feelings and what she thinks?  you are wasting your time fretting over the past.  move on with your life.  you'll be better for it.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	Damn that sucks, sorry to hear that, she just sounds like a *****.|`|AA11105522	well if i read in between lines maybe her family told her hubby, he took it the wrong way, approached her and it caused issues in there relationship. maybe it was something in the things that you sent that brought back memories OR something that made them think you wanted her back and that was your way of reaching out to her. i would suggest that if/when you talk to them again you apologize for whatever made them upset, tell them it wont happen again and move on because obviously she has so now it's your turn. good luck!|`|lzooHi0Baa	The only thing I can think of is that getting her stuff back got her in trouble with her husband.   Some men can be insanely jealous and insecure.   The same way a woman can be intimidated and controlled by this jealousy.   I would put this behind.   Once you get off the guilt trip, you will see the light.   She got you on the guilt trip the moment she used the excuse for her leaving you and that was because you had no intentions of marrying her.   I have heard a lot of excuses to get out of a relationship, but this one takes the medal.  Open your eyes.  You sound like a real nice, decent guy.  Move on and find that girl that will appreciate you and will love you enough to propose marriage to you.|`|571QpSNhaa	i don't see why shes so mad. she was the one who left you.<br>  but it could be that she just wanted you to show her that you cared<br>  still about her but it seems like you didn't show it so shes mad.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	hey dummy, this is like the second or third time with this same question.  get over it pal.  she moved on jesus christ.|`|89lAhznQaa	if you can't find out why she became like that it's better to move on|`|1ea451e36b1c7169d47c66a544f52138aa	This is tough. You are in a bad position. <br>  She is mad, because she feels that she had to dump you when she did and she got married because she felt she needed to, not because she wanted to really be married to this guy. She probably blames you for everything that she "had to do" and without realizing it, she is mad at herself. She probably still loves you and wants to go back but she put herself in this position and sees no "out" .<br>  She doesn't want to be responsible for her actions, she just wants everybody to tell her that she was right to do what she did and support her to be angry.<br>  She probably has problems with her husband already and she is mad that she is "sleeping in her own bed" so to speak. There is nothing you can do, you just need to move on. Trust me, there are many other girls just like her that you can have a passionate and great relationship with. You don't need to hope for a nother chance with her, because at this point she is not the same girl that you think you love anymore. She has issues now and garbage that would lead to arguments and problems between the two of you, if you ever had another chance together. Eventually, you guys would waiste your time trying to start over again, when it's out of your control already because of what took place in the last 1-2 years.<br>  I wish you luck and new love. I wish you a fresh start with a new girl, give someone new a chance. You might have to kiss a few totes before you find your princess, but it will be so much better for you in the long run!|`|2r7dudZCaa	man there are two possibilities that my femme psyche can fig.<br>  <br>  she's pretty pissed off because she still loves you but wants to get over you because she's already married - READ: why'd you have to go let her AND her parents (her hubby may have also found that out) know you still have all her stuff with you all this time? if she'd consider marrying him a big mistake, well dude don't add up to the drama. get a life and let her live. it's a choice she made and she should stick to it like supermighty bond.<br>  <br>  she's bloody pissed because you're being such an *** showing the whole world that this married woman's stuff is being tossed around like an underwear with a "i slept with this woman and she's not gonna have anyone better than me" note on it (that is after she dumped you). argh man she shouldn't be pissed, she should despise you haha. she prolly felt taken for granted in the past which a big part of it is of course your fault that you should admit. and now that she finally moved on, you subconsciously show her what a loser she is. don't be effing selfish. you don't really love her. you're just sourgraping because you cannot accept the fact that she dumped you.<br>  <br>  stop loving the thought that you love a woman only because she dumped you. yeah go on loving yourself but don't overdo it or else you're gonna drive more women off the wall. aheh peace!|`|557f121bfd3b4b87eb6c5214cbb1e223aa	It's obviously going to take a while for you to get over how you were let go, but it doesn't matter why she's angry.  She probably would've been none the wiser had you tossed her stuff.  She didn't come for them after all that time, so she wasn't missing any of it.  The only thing I can offer is she was probably ticked off because you made the first move to let HER go.<br>  <br>  Some women like to have their MAIN man - and have another one pining for them.  Makes them feel powerful or something, I guess.
2qnW0TAAaa	Let me see hmm girls well......They ask for too much even though they don't mean to.Girls are sometimes really annoying and bitchy.I do like like that they have a vagina and boobs.|`|96dd1ddeb6999bc938d40452d39493b5aa	I find many people annoying, but it has less to do with their gender, than it does their personality types.  The stereotype is that men are aggressive while women are nurturing.  Not necessarily true, as I have known a lot of kind and gentle men, and women who are aggressive female dogs.<br>  <br>  What I find annoying about people in general is their closed mindedness and "my-way-or-the-highway" type of personality.  While a lot of men possess this attitude, a lot of women do too, and these are the type of people I won't hesitate to stay away from, because such people are extremely difficult to get along with.|`|VyPIMvDfaa	probably their lack of understanding for the opposite sex. going either way. i dun liek the lack of understanding boys have for girls, nor do i liek the lack of understanding girls have foe boys.<br>  <br>  i also don't liek the way they act so non-caring and such<br>  they say they only act liek they don't care; but they really do.<br>  i think if they do care aand such. they should show it. not saying a lot or ne thing, but at least a hint of it.  l0l|`|wWVbFBtqaa	When they are always trying to impress girls and impress their friends.

Though, bowling places can be a bit noisy because they usually have music playing, other big groups of people talking, and the sounds of the pins falling can be loud...so that can be hard to talk over for some.<br>  <br>  I would say going to dinner or something like that is where you would be able to talk a lot. If you want to talk a ton, I wouldn't say bowling is thing for you, but I do think it is a great date idea overall because it's fun and casual.  <br>  <br>  One of my best first dates was rollerblading, which is also fun and casual, but it is in a quiet park in nature...I got to talk to my date a lot on that one!|`|YgnA2cIpaa	Yeaa x <br>  If she doent talk much then comfort her and talk to herr <br>  If you didnt talk then it would be likee ........ boring<br>  So dont make it a bad date talk to her and bee coooll x|`|JJARLh3zaa	yeah, sure. you don't have to spend every second bowling. dinner first is a good idea. or even coffee or dessert or something<br>  <br>  keep smiling ^_^|`|AA11307468	It depends on if the bowling alley plays loud music as some do, and whether it will be just the two of you or if others will be joining you.  <br>  Both of you just have to make that effort to keep the conversation going, knowing that you will be getting up frequently to take your next shot.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Definitely!

sYZECXNGaa	She simply likes attention, and knows that you liked her, so wants you to always like her, even though you have no chance. I know it seems mean, and won't make sense to you, but that is just how many insecure girls feel; they just need people to validate them. I'm sorry, I hope you find someone better, and cease to give her the attention she craves. Good Luck!|`|NUBeg2paaa	Playing hard to get.|`|4bfUC8hDaa	maybe she does like you but was unsure if you actually asked her out... I speak from experience here, this guy once asked me if I liked school dances and then walked away. The next day (there was a school dance the day he asked me the question) he was moping around and all his friends said that I broke his heart. Was it clear that you were asking her out?|`|o9VKZKpQaa	maybe she regrets not saying yes before.<br>  :/<br>  wait a while and see if she keeps trying to get your attention,<br>  and maybe try aksing her again,<br>  and if she says no, levave it at that.

gO9tl2uhaa	Yeah..the playful ''let's both say it at the same time'' is suppose to be used with nice things to say, not breaking up crap. That's a serious talk.<br>  <br>  I say you just go apologize to him and give him some closure. He still deserves some respect since you're breaking up with him. <br>  <br>  So, just go see him. Apologize for that moment and explain why it isn't working out - don't say something like "it's me, my fault and I can't explain". That's cheap. Say what you really feel about him, even if it makes you (or him) feel awful. He has the right to know and he obviously needs closure.|`|M63kq3AYaa	You've done enough, just stay away from him and let him keep what's left of his dignity.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	nothing....!!! just leave him alone...dont go back to him just bcoz u feel sorry 4 him....but only if u love him!!|`|UUrqECXIaa	There's no reason for you to apologize.

DozD8lTGaa	He is just looking out for you... Secretly i think he is a bit jealous; he probably thinks boys will look at you and you will be interested in them.<br>  <br>  But, if he trusts you he shouldn't worry.<br>  Talk to him about it and let him know that you are only there for a job; not for attention from boys or any other reason...<br>  <br>  <br>  I think talking to him and telling him a bit more about it all and how you feel is the best option :) But, don't let him try and rule your life!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope i helped.

d5d3d49e305b06c6f5252e0d0508cd4baa	Well, give yourself some homework and think of a number of subjects that you can strike a conversation on and keep it going.  Talk about the news, latest happenings you your area, your hobbies or you can do something together that does not require much talking like watching a movie together.|`|aLKXnw5Haa	if hes quiet and reserve he may have and analytical personality. he pays attention to detail.  you will get alot more conversation out of him if you find out his hobbies.  ask how certain things work.  and you may have open up a can of worms he'll never shut up.  keep your eyes wide open, wrinkle your forehead and nod alot. and repeat the last 4 words he said in a question!<br>  or he could just be a potential serial killer|`|pxlu5Wgqaa	Say funny things, say funny anecdotes that happent to you.|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	talk about a-rod

Ef4NVxH7aa	Talk to Nate about this , communication is the best thing in relationships ,he might be a little carried away with this Briana chick, If you talk to him he might realise that you guys are drifting apart , also talk to Briana tell her to remind Nate that you are his girl not her ,politely ask to stop spending to much time with Nate, because that is causing problems between nate and you|`|cUO2zYsnaa	I had the same problem with my girlfriend. She flirted with one guy, then she started liking him, so she broke up with me, now they're dating. What you need to do is ask Nate if he still likes you. Tell him that it hurts you to see that he's always talking with Briana. If he likes you, he'll stop. Thanks :)<br>  (If you dont get any good answers, please make this one a best answer, I need it, I'm a poor man when it comes to best answers, haha)|`|IUw0f5u5aa	Give them enough rope, you will soon suss out what is going on.|`|oz5B5q7zaa	Umm.<br>  Tell Him How You Feel.<br>  Ask Him What's Going On.<br>  Don't Let Assuptions Ruin Your Relationships.<br>  Hope It Helps;.|`|Ykz5WZTGaa	Nate? no way, Nate?

BO can be cured by taking a bath and using a deodorant.  Bad breath can also be a problem, mostly because we can not smell our own bad breath.  Most bad breath is cause by bacteria on the tongue which must be removed in order to get rid of bad breath.  Sometimes you can see this bacteria as a white stuff on the top of your tongue.  I use an OraBrush tongue cleaner because it is both a brush and a scraper.  Works really well.<br>  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	lack of cleanliness<br>  dirty fingernails!!

rY84Ap6Maa	yahoo answers but they dont reply to questions usually exept for i do which is weird.....
S8A9s0hjaa	hi!!! i know that u are probably wondering about this question 24/7 and u probably already know the answer to ur own question butt..... i have to include that yes , he likes u, is the answer!! also maybe he is shy or maybe he already considers u his (sort of) girlfriend. like maybe he goes home and teels his sister or anyone that he is close to that he has a girlfriend and maybe they ask him "really?" and he says" well kind of i mean we already told eachother that we like eachother!" so yes i absolutely am 100% sure he likes u!!! i just also have to include that u should really make the first move!! i mean if u dont then maybe he never will until he gets the guts to....maybe u should give him a nudge and say " hey theres this new movie this weekend......do u wanna go......with me"? and i think that u should like really call him up on his phone ( since uve already got his phone number ) then u should say something like " hey do we have homework for english class?" then he can say "no or yes we do" then u can just go into a full conversation about anything u would like to talk about!!! feel comfortable with him!!! flirt with him!!! have fun with it!!!!have fun with learning more about him!!!|`|rbyxbzh7aa	He dosnt liike you in that way or he just dosn't like rejection (many boys who arent shy fear that) just nudge him in the right direction|`|fi2Ofymaaa	your ugly|`|Dx23osxWaa	i think hes waiting for the perfect moment!! just give it some time|`|GpxOn4R3aa	why don't you just ask him out ???|`|gRXy66dOaa	he either doesnt like you or he is shy|`|VyHMmGeaaa	my opinion is that maybe he's not ready yet....|`|0ktcvglRaa	He sounds like the type of guy who needs to be told in a very straight forward way that you want to be with him. Maybe he thinks that you're going to say no or be taken aback by it, or maybe he just wants to wait for the perfect moment!|`|z3g6G4cTaa	ew y do u like the smell of boogn?!|`|kxnfn2Kkaa	i will happen, he likes you, don't doubt that. be sure that he knows you like him, dont text him about it, phone him so he knows its you, or if you want to, have faith, face to face.|`|1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	.....ask him out instead!!!!!<br>  maybe he's not sure if you like him back. i had a super similar situation. just do what i should have done and ask him. i didn't, and i regret it.|`|HNAVlwV7aa	he probably considers u as his gf already.|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	Maybe he's wondering the same thing.<br>  <br>  In fact, so am I.<br>  <br>  why haven't YOU asked him out yet?
wHDxWWhraa	hi,<br>  ofcourse you must tell him when you are sure,he must atleast take the responsibility for having the good times with you...<br>  and girl, you have nothing to still loose...you all ready lost your entire WORLD,contact me to tell how to create your world independently from others(even your parents),anywayz now since everything is gone....and don't worry everything will be great afterwards...tell him when sure that you're pregnant...this would return him to you and will be the shock that will return him to his conciuosness and know who are you and how you are suffering for and from him !|`|POHWTDPRaa	Don't tell him anything until you are sure you are pregnant. If you aren't, you won't have to say anything. If you are, your focus needs to be on your baby and not on moping over your ex. You can move on. Yes, it is difficult now and it will be for a little while. But you can't keep feeling sorry for yourself. You start to move on and then you feel better, not the other way around.|`|ACiAWj4Uaa	You not being able to get over him is normal. But if you don't think that you prego and you just say that cause you want to get back to him you would be a horrible heartless kid! Get a test to c if you r and if u r tell him if you are not then if you love him try at least to get him back!|`|4rCZ8ahoaa	i think you should be more concerned about what you're going to do about the possible pregnancy before wanting him back|`|GdRTaqOdaa	watever you do.. dont tell him your prego till your 100 percent sure..|`|PS83gPGoaa	take a test to see if ur pregnant then think about wot ur going to do
uIhFpcYwaa	Hey I really Think you should apoligize regardless MAybe he had other reasons for not replying. Right? Give him another chance things might wokr out <br>  Good Luck<br>  Nash|`|W0J5IhSPaa	don't feel bad and dont say sorry! its his fault. i dont think you should go back out with him- my personal opinion- but if you want to be nice to him thats your choice. and i would say the exact same thing if that was me!! so dont feel bad|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I think that you should tell him that you are soory because that is the right thing to do. I would get along with him and maybe things will be different now.|`|o6ZNZzT3aa	Has he told you he's sorry, if he hasn't, I wouldnt get back with him.|`|zXXD0gk9aa	Sometimes it take guys a little while to figure out what they want.  I am a believer in that everyone should have a second chance.  But, if he hurt you very badly, I would forget about him.  He did not answer your phone calls or texts for a reason.  But, maybe you should just talk it out... it can clarify some things and help you make a decision.|`|cUO2zYsnaa	It's all about what youre fine with. He did cheat on you, so that shows that he doesnt respect you enough. But if he is genuinely sorry, and he proves himself worthy to be your man, go for it. It's all what you believe, relationships are two people, if one person has a problem, it can't live.|`|TieDK667aa	girl! make that jerk jealous! he has now realized that he has made a huge mistake. if he really cared about you than he woulda never cheated on you. if you do give him another chance you will always have a trust issue. you will always be thinking is he gonna cheat on me again! i wouldnt wanna go through that! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JfEXUqnKaa	Well, he shouln't have cheated on you, but just try and be friends and work your way up. If after you become friends you feel you can trust him then its settled. But if he does it again. Dump him for good.|`|7pYyXSBUaa	Forget him sister! He is an A** for doing that to you in the first place!<br>  Move-on and If I were you I'd get him back by talking,flirting or even dating another guy right in front of him! See how he likes them apples! lol|`|oz5B5q7zaa	Say your sorry. IF you really are.<br>  Do You still like him?<br>  He likes you still, and if you like him.. Then looks like you got your self a new boy friend.|`|XvWHlfkkaa	Don't feel bad because he cheated on you. to me, cheating is one of the worst things you can do to someone. <br>  <br>  But then again maybe he did realize what he did was completely wrong and wants to be with you again, but it just depends on how much you trust him. you can try and get along with him (not specifically go out with him again) and just see how it goes. <br>  <br>  i wouldnt get back together with him so fast|`|igrdohopaa	If I were you. I wouldn't talk to him nor look at him.<br>  HES A CHEATER!|`|h9fKoHGyaa	Give him a second chance. If you know he's being sincere, then go out with him again.

fG50fL91aa	well....just because you talk to a girl doesnt mean that they will think you want to go out with them(even if you do) just mention something like "we should hang out sometime" and see what they say. or ask for a cell number. Just dont be shy and do keep talking to them
2tn8EALqaa	Not sure what "normal" is. It isn't "typical" that's for sure.<br>  You're thinking to much. Don't go out thinking "I need to find a (girl)friend". Just relax and converse for fun.<br>  It ends in the class because you end it in the class. You could always suggest a movie. It will probably be awkward the first time. But after a while, it will become normal and maybe they will even invite you to join them for dinner or parties.<br>  <br>  What does having a bf have to do with anything? Do  you want to be her friend or her boyfriend?? <br>  <br>  You can't love conversation if you can't do it.
LtlBILW1aa	well, no offence but alot of people like huging people that are pretty so if you are pretty then it will work for you<br>  it doesnt mater to me <br>  but its just the way most odf the people do.<br>  if you could put a pic of yourself it would be easier to tell you if you could be popular like that<br>  but dont worry there are lots of different ways of being popular<br>  good luck!|`|evJ2GEodaa	You just asked like the same question a minute ago!|`|PS83gPGoaa	be yourself dont just copy your mate|`|pEztJVlbaa	i don't like hugs i find them very awkward lol<br>  but do wat u want...<br>  xx<br>  :D|`|kMIiOcTraa	Sometimes it will, but popularity isn't always the smart choice. Why do you want to hugs loads of people, just let it come natural. Trust me, that way it isn't so much work. Find you some good, stable friends to hang with.|`|Jhr68T0baa	Hugging people does not make you popular.<br>  why be so shallow?|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	just be yourself, find something that works for you, not your friend<br>  and some people hate hugs, like it invades their space...especially if you don't know them that well|`|AA11603529	Everyone loves hugs!!!
ok4sqhRvaa	i think thats hot, since im a guitarist myself. if my girl can play the guitar its a bonus, then we can jam together|`|A1xOf1O9aa	iv been playing guitar for about 12 years now so id think it was cool and hot.|`|fomkCUCiaa	I think most guys wouldn't care if you had callus on your hands, they'd be more interested in your skills with the axe.<br>  <br>  As for hand holding, if he's cool with it, it's all good. if he's not, wear gloves.
jIM9CbQJaa	by meeting someone else.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Wow, only complete losers break up through text messages!<br>  <br>  Just focus more on school, hang out with friends, read books, watch movies, listen to new music... Anything that will take your mind off of him!<br>  <br>  You deserve to be happy and I'm sure a new guy who is WAY perfect for you will come along eventually.|`|svsABLHpaa	Try and meet other people, but some relationships we just never get over....i can never forget this relationship i had one time no matter what i do....<br>  <br>  but fyi for this guy and any other guy out there....<br>  only loosers ask you out through text...<br>  and even bigger loosers will break up with you through text....|`|xSb9f8Aoaa	I can see why you're angry. Thats just shallow. Wake up everyday and tell yourself how much better off you are without him and what a jerk he is. Then meet somebody new and flaunt your new relationship in front of your ex. it'll kill him|`|h0DrCwtmaa	First of all that guy is a jerk because of the way he broke up with you!!  second just go hang out with friends and do something you love. God does things for a reason so he wasnt the one
QlvcSgn0aa	i didnt have a girlfriend till I was 18. not by choice i was just shy. Now im 23 have a ton of confidence and can talk to any girl at any time. When you get older youll find out what you did when you were a teenager doesnt mean a thing|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	I had boyfriends at that age, but it was always a group thing. You really can't "date" until you can drive. That's when you can go out on your own. It's overrated. Hanging out with your friends is way more fun than dealing with the drama of a jr. high relationship! All throughout even high school, I was more interested in hanging out with a group of friends. I had a few boyfriends, but I didn't like the drama that came with it. It was more fun to be single. My friends who had to have a boyfriend at all times thought I was odd, but I had a lot more fun  b/c I wasn't wasting my time fighting with my boyfriends like they were. I got my first real long-term relationship when I was a senior in high school, only b/c all of my friends were in serious relationships. And you know what, he was a pain in my butt and I would have been just as satisfied waiting till college for a serious relationship. But I learned a lot from his controlling self. I learned that I am way too independent for a man to control me or think he can tell me what I can or cannot do. See all the fun your not missing out on? Trust me, just enjoy your youth, you won't regret it. Boys and girls are nothing but trouble and not worth the drama.|`|LoUpiv4Gaa	I wanted to start dating at 12 but i didn't get my first boyfriend til i was 15 and then i split up wit him, got another bf, split up wit him, got another bf and split up with him, now im single, trust me you never know whats gonna happen or who youl meet, so don't worry, you want to start dating for ages and then 3 com along all at once loll hope that's helped xxx|`|MMkGjUc8aa	i started at 13 and i think its a good age to start dating before 13 i think its too early cause your a kid after 13 you start growing up|`|ff545BLyaa	12 and i wish I had waited...|`|kpUdLDQGaa	Well, I started dating when I was 15. I'm almost 16 now.<br>  BUT, I'm not allowed to cause my dad thinks 16 is too young...
SGjhNidDaa	yes, it definitely works. for a couple weeks, i would say.<br>  try acting like you dont really care, but KIND of. so sort of misleading, keep him guessing. make sure you look GREAT every time. he'll wonder why you arent begging for him back, and he'll want you back!|`|oY1YzPMzaa	Yea I have done this before. If they are the one that asked for space and I didnt want it and then they were asking me back, then I would go. If it was me who wanted the space then it would depend on if I thought I had enough time to think about things.
5687JygEaa	Well for me it took about 4 months, but he kept IMing me once in a while....still it felt like we didn't talk at all. He came back, but a bit too soon....it just ended up ruining everything, and now I'm back to getting the IM every once in a while. I was so preoccupied with finding ways to get back with him that I never noticed that I had to fix a few things about myself.

juWJ47hXaa	Of course she is lying to you. All girls lie.<br>  <br>  Q) How do you know when a girl is lying?<br>  A) When she is talking.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	I'm a "three strikes" kind of guy -- keep trying with her, but if after a third postponement, I would just move things to just a friendly level and move on.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	just call her n tell her wat u feel.....dont assume things!|`|IuJcKGroaa	No you shouldn't call her. She's suppose to let you know if she can hang out with you. If she doesn't call you to hang out this time then it's not meant to be. Because honestly not matter what boy or girl if the person is into you they will make the effort to call or to at least hang out with you. But if it really bothers you I would just text her once and if she doesn't text back then you know that she's just not that into you.|`|0ktcvglRaa	If you call her, you won't be looking desperate at all... You just want an answer!<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like she is either a really busy person (which is likely), or maybe she just doesn't know how to turn you down, so she's making up excuses in the mean time.|`|P21RQ8xpaa	maybe she is just nervous to go so she is making up things. if it happens again next time, talk to her and see what is going on!!|`|TGbcd9VQaa	Just call her and say you were wondering if she was okay i guess|`|K9BT12kpaa	wow.. dude chil, girls are suposed to be the freaked out ones, its fine. god we know who wears the pants in that relationship|`|8Zlrbeh0aa	dude i had the same problem<br>  i mean if you really like the girl then dont take this advice but just read it anyway<br>  <br>  i had a girlfriend who i really really liked<br>  unfortunately she lived an hour away<br>  so we'd see eachother every weekend<br>  but i was the one who always had to call her to make plans<br>  it was like she didnt even care<br>  and when ever i finally could convince my parents to get me there (couldnt drive yet)<br>  she would act like it was some big inconvenience to see me<br>  i would push all my plans out of the way but she would have some little thing like hanging out with a friend she sees every day in school and would tell me "next weekend"<br>  <br>  in my situation i ended up dumping her and im happy now cuz theres no more stress to go to see her<br>  <br>  my real advice dont get stressed out about it she probably hasnt checked her phone or it ran out of battery<br>  if anything just send a "Hey whats up" just to check on her<br>  dont interrogate her

If he really honestly loves you and takes you back..for god's sake ..dont screw up again!
JDRXoMYcaa	Say, you like someone. You're bursting to find out if he/she likes you back. If only it were that easy and he/she would just pop out of nowhere and tell you that they like you. Most people don't have the guts to tell you, with the fear of being rejected. No one likes that feeling; no one wants it. You *could* ask your friends to ask him/her. Maybe you can find out by yourself. If a person likes you, they might:<br>  <br>  1. Sneak a peek at you occasionally when they think you're not looking.<br>  2. Sometimes goes out of their way to be nice to you.<br>  3. Can't look at you directly in the eyes when you're talking to them.<br>  4. Blushes whenever you try to strike up a conversation with them.<br>  <br>  That's all I got, so basically...that's it. :D Good luck.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	looks at you all the time.

If you are in 5th - 6th grade they usually pick on you a lot. If you are in 7th and up they are usually very touchy feely, and if you are grown well most grown men will come right out and tell you.|`|QAc9LoVzaa	He tells you|`|r3Ps2Xpdaa	How Can you not!!!!|`|TieDK667aa	Some clues might be that he wants to hang out all the time. When ya'll are together he seems sad when you have to go. He wants to be with you all the time. He stares at you ( but not the creepy stare). When you talk to him he looks you in the eyes and you know he is listening to you. He is always there for you. When you are sad he is always there to cheer you up. He tries to make you laugh.|`|urfVAfHAaa	Ask him, just because a guy talks to u or looks at you don't all ways mean he likes you.If you really wanna know ask him or if you are 2 scard to ask him have someone do it for you everone is diffent in there own little ways|`|IUw0f5u5aa	He looks you in the eye all the time, asks how you are - what have you be doing, and encourages you to talk about yourself.|`|AAexkTAKaa	-they always look at u<br>  -they act really shy when they talk to u<br>  -they sometimes tease u<br>  -their mates start flirting with u to take the mic out of HIM<br>  -they smile at u|`|YJcd8OAeaa	if he treats you differently than others or he looks for your attention more than others|`|9a506c84f370dbf2fecea59b04578a36aa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Likes-You" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Lik...</a><br>  <br>  :D|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	he flirts, looks, touches, you all the time|`|Qe95LNxYaa	ask him it is not a rocket science|`|0SREhTB2aa	Depending on what kinds of things he does around you.<br>  Does he hint at you?<br>  Does he try talking to you?<br>  Does he seem interested?<br>  If your still confused then do the right thing and ask.<br>  If you really don't know then you could try talking to him and ask him if he likes you, that is if you have the nerve to.<br>  Basically, you can tell if someone likes you. <br>  Smiling at you and looking at you then looking away when you look are some kind of hints you could take as them liking you.|`|tzwPcqk6aa	There are many ways to notice they like you.

DcrI9zmkaa	On the one hand I want to say talk to her and see where you stand before you "erase her number and forget about it".  On the other, I think if she were *really* that important to you, you wouldn't be so quick to want to forget her.<br>  <br>  Bottom line? I'd say it's time to move on.
yHEk5IJoaa	I think you should keep waiting for her. Don't call her or bug her and leave her alone to think for awhile. If nothing happens then maybe you should move on.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Stop waiting. Talk to her. Tell her you don't feel it's right for you just to be left hanging. She's had two weeks and thats more than enough time to make a decision.|`|3vmDRCTCaa	Tell her that you want to respect her wishes and will give her a break. Let her know that when she's ready to talk, you'll be right there. Don't pester her with texts, phone calls, and e-mails. Just tell her that you care about her and are willing to wait until she wants to talk about it. If she doesn't contact you in a certain amount of time and you feel like she doesn't care, at that point you can start to move on with your life.|`|gNfkzw9Saa	You cant love someone in 2 weeks.<br>  What you need to start doing is to distinguish your feelings.<br>  You are infatuated with her. You like her, you enjoy your time with her and you are happy that you are dating her. BUT you dont love her.<br>  She needs her space and I dont blame her. After two weeks its scary to hear a guy say that.<br>  By not hearing from her is her answer to you.|`|AA10477412	Forget get about her, she might come back but believe me if you are a good guy there are plenty of soul mates out there.<br>  <br>  In about a week she may get lonely seeing whats out there....
vEpSsRDxaa	ok, how long were y'all together before you told her you love her? are you still in love with her even after this time apart?
AA10816009	Yes I would say start looking for a new boyfriend.<br>  Please don't think that your are going to change him. He should not be pulling you anywhere! Tell him not to touch you.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	That you have to ask means that you are concerned...and you have a feeling that this is a sign, which it is. Why is he pulling on you and blocking a door...that is what you have to ask yourself.|`|oVGOW3xPaa	i wouldnt put up with it|`|u9PxChF2aa	Yes he will be abusive. Especially when you do something he doesn't like, like hang around people he doesn't like. Than is controlling too. The only reason why he didn't hit you was because of people who would hear or see. When you too are alone make sure to be aware. Good chances he wont hit you in public but in private he probably will. It's a good chance you have a abusive boyfriend.|`|EdidZdtlaa	you i think he is abusive and it only gets worse in abusive relationships. i read it in this book and you should get out of relationships with people like that. hes not gonna want to let you go if you brake up with him but you have to let him go if you decide to. it only gets worse|`|nqkXE1cUaa	<a href="http://www.runawayteens.org/abusive-boyfriend.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.runawayteens.org/abusive-boyf...</a>|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Yea, it does.  If the only reason he didn't lay into you in the bathroom was because there were too many people who knew you both means if you'd both been alone, he would have hit you.  If he slammed you against the wall because he was pissed and thought about hitting you but then his better judgment made him stop, he might be able to control his anger and not hurt you.<br>  <br>  But abuse isn't only physical stuff like hitting.  If this guy thinks he can control you by hoping to terrorize you or some other mean psychological-emotional way of trying to control you, then that could be just as bad or worse.  If you weren't even smoking but just talking to people who were, why is he getting bent out of shape with you anyway?  People often smoke at parties and you cannot control that.  You were just talking to smoker and everyone has to do that in real life whether you want to or not.  All he needed to do was quietly remind you that he doesn't like girls who smoke.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on him--you don't have to break up with him now but if he has an anger control problem or starts to shove you in bathrooms (or other places) in anger, it might be a good sign to get out while you can.|`|EFOBeGu4aa	You better keep your eyes and ears open.  Sounds like you got your first peak at an ugly monster you don't want to feed.  Okay, so you soooo in love with him, so give him a second chance and that's it.  Dump him before he really hurts you.  You know you can been abused in all different kinds of ways, it doesn't have to be strickly physical.  Verbal abuse and emotional abuse are just as damaging.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	I don't even need to read your question because just by asking this you should get rid of him as your already worried. Do not stay with someone like that!|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	It's a red flag.<br>  <br>  For sure a big enough one to distance yourself from him to guage whether you want to stay in it.|`|YJGEEJhWaa	mm sounds like he's got a short temper.<br>  just be weary and keep it in the back of your mind. if anything like this happens again, just dump him.|`|0ktcvglRaa	It sounds like he's going down that path, yes... You should confront him about it and hopefully it won't continue!|`|4zqGPICsaa	Girl, if she gonna Chris Brown you,<br>  dump his sorry ***.|`|S4soZUFCaa	That's a good indicator that he will be.|`|tmfhieP7aa	Oh wow he sounds very controlling and in an unhealthy way. He doesn't trust you, he doesn't believe you when you say you weren't smoking, he didn't even let you explain. I'm quite scared for you actually. He very well could be abusive, if he does something like that again, confront him and perhaps try to get out of the relationship if you feel in danger. Or maybe just confront him about how horrible that made you feel and get out of that relationship now.|`|hiuMrxGkaa	I would be scared if I were you.<br>  Has he had any more of an abusive past?<br>  <br>  When he's calm you should talk to him and tell him that you DO NOT like to be shoved or pushed. Tell him that he scared you and that if it happens again you might leave him. Also tell him that you didn't appreciate being thrown around like that and that he needs to not overreact. <br>  <br>  To answer your question; I think that if you let him get away with this he might become abusive.<br>  <br>  Best of luck! :)|`|cyt7oh97aa	He could begin to be abusive.  Since you've been together for a year the honeymoon feeling could be over.  If your friends weren't there he probably would have hit you.  And fighting over smoking is petty.  He has a very bad temper and if he is going to get violent over something so small and stupid then imagine how violent he'd be over something serious.  I'd get out of it if I were you.|`|stzU3bciaa	Oh yeah - you need to run long and fast!  Things will get worse.  I have been in relationships like that and the control gets worse and worse.  You keep telling yourself things will get better, he will learn that he can trust me and the list goes on and on.  You find someone who will treat you the way a person should be treated.  Because you know we are all princesses and we should be treated as such!|`|XukScWE3aa	If you think so it is. Get out and do not go back. It does not sound good. But remember that you may be part of the reason. Fighting between a couple is bad. But if you can talk out your our problems then it is better.|`|y7JfsiFkaa	I think so..... but you shouldn't wait for him to hit you so THEN you can know that he is abusive. You shouldnt go out with him i think it an abusive relationship|`|AIRxWgumaa	It could progress into something more serious.|`|AA10938466	YES , be careful around him.|`|1tL6wRy0aa	leave him u can do better..|`|2c6af8e5efa13b80409fa9ba063313b8aa	Suggest that you avoid parties where your friends smoke and your boyfriend drinks!<br>  Does he have a pet dog?  Is it well looked after and trained without abuse?<br>  Your boyfriend seens to object to smoking but is he against drugs.  If you never smoke cigarettes then it is more difficult to get into the drug culture.<br>  Talk to him to find out what it is about smoking that worries him. TALK to him about his excess drinking and that when he is drunk you get frightened.  A MAN will NOT hit a woman, a coward might and probably will.  If he hits you before you get married then DO NOT marry him.  No excuses if you have a violent marriage.  <br>  The law is there to help you if you make a mistake.  Good luck.|`|cUO2zYsnaa	Well, maybe not. He could be. But I think he's just more forceful than anything. A lot of guys know better than to hit their girlfriends, because they know you'll be in trouble with their girlfriend, and their girlfriends friends. I think he might want to control your health, because he really cares about you. I do not think he's abbusive. And you know what, one day you might be thankful for his forcefulness, it might really get you out of some situations. I think he's also protective of you, he doesnt like the fact that you're smoking, and he knows that it's a safety hazard. So this guy isnt really bad, I think he's a good guy, but his forceful ness might get out of control one day, watch it.|`|vl3jH9oHaa	There is a story of bird who thought that he could stay up in the north a little longer and enjoy before the cold winter really hits. But when it really mattered and he started to fly down south, he got snowed on. Fell to the ground covered in snow, cold and freezing. It just so happened that a cow passed by and dropped some dung on the bird and the nice warmth made the bird start chirping and whistling.<br>  then a cayote heard the whisting and came by and in two scoops eat the dung and bird and all. it was a total clean up.<br>  <br>  moral of the story...not everyone who sh-- on you is your enemy and not everyone who cleans up the sh-t is you friend.<br>  <br>  was you friend being mean when he tried to stop you from doing something that you would want to stop doing some day.
rdkCzDSyaa	I would suggest pour your heart out and tell him exactly how you feel.You know him better than any of us so just subtly let him know you want to get back together and don't come on too strong.Hope it all works out for you!!|`|TMjpWxU5aa	Tis texting.. etc hav no power..<br>  Just talk 2 him, straight..<br>  U just say wat u want 4rm him..<br>  Likke..<br>  U care 4 him.U want 2 spend ur whole life wid him.. wanna take care of him, support him..<br>  Wanna b mother 2 his kids, grown in ur womb..<br>  U know, speak womenly, responsibily...<br>  But watever u speak, speak the truth..<br>  Good luck|`|K3a2fcq8aa	say " even though you are one person and i kno theres more out there...ur just the one person i cant live my life without!" or somethingg like that haah|`|FgSTHArKaa	holy!!! 4 years is a long time!<br>  even if u guys do get back togehter he will alwyas put his mom/dad ahead of you and take their advice or anything will be better than you<br>  i dont think u want that|`|LDe9yzCKaa	Im sorry to hear this... i really am. and u probably wont like what i have to say, but you have to hear it... if not from me then someone else.<br>  <br>  If he left you after a 4 yr relationship for his parents... do you really think he loves you enough? When you love someone you fight for them, u don't just give up. He obviously cares more for his parents than he does for you... and now, even if he does come back to you, his parents will always have a large impact on your relationship.<br>  <br>  In the past 5 months, did he even try to get in touch with you? If this guy really truly loved you, he would have never left you in the 1st place, cause he would rather die than hurt you in any way.<br>  <br>  Forget about him and move on. There are plenty of guys out there who are not mommy's little boys... they are real men. Find some who deserves to be loved by you. Love someone who loves YOU.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I know its hard, but its the best thing you can do for yourself right now. Best of Luck!|`|5EfJu34taa	its of no use dear.believe me i am in the same situation.guys usually back off(unless they truly love you) in such cases.according to your description it seems that he's more into his family than you.just imagine after 4 years he's saying like that!!!i don't understand why on earth such guys love someone in the first place if they don't wanna follow it afterwards???<br>  anyways i would sincerely advice you not to text him.bcoz it won't affect him in any way.
IPS3hWweaa	It's okay to be nice, but don't let people take advantage of you just because they know you're nice. And if someone keeps doing the same thing to you over and over, and it's mean, don't forgive them.

If it's something big (eg. betrayed trust) then forgiveness is still the best thing to do even if it takes a long time.|`|8zd6OqJ5aa	I have the same problem =/ <br>  <br>  The truth is, it is a bad thing and it's a good thing<br>  <br>  Bad: People might walkover you....<br>          You will probably get hurt more in the end<br>          You will probably get confused (asking yourself why you're too nice)<br>  <br>  Good: Shows you have a big heart<br>            Means you are a true friend<br>            Means that you actually still have hope in others even when they don't deserve it =]<br>            It will show you who your true friends are|`|FkYkt4Fbaa	YOu can never be to nice!

AA11263103	This is a guide to basic kissing, i.e. you learn the basics and get the basics right, then experiment and try different styles and more advanced techniques. <br>  <br>  The basics <br>  <br>  1. Brush your teeth, get a good bath, nicely groomed and clean and fresh, before meeting the other person. There's nothing worse than kissing the rear end of a garbage truck <br>  <br>  2. Get into a comfortable position - you can't kiss if your back feels like it's gonna break. Suggestion - Sit side by side on a comfy sofa. <br>  <br>  3. Hold your lover , firmly but gently - don't cause pain. Suggestion would be to hold the shoulders, the neck or gently on the side of the face, one side or both sides. <br>  <br>  4. Move your faces closer. Don't bump noses. Suggestion would be the guy angle his face slightly so you don't bump noses. <br>  <br>  5. Kiss gently, normal closed lips kissing, and close your eyes. Closing your eyes increases the sensations you feel, and also sets the mood. <br>  <br>  6. Continue kissing gently. Get comfortable with simple closed lips, lip-to-lip kissing before going anywhere else. <br>  <br>  7. If fine till here, tentatively, slowly and lightly draw your tongue across the other person's lips. <br>  <br>  8. Chances are from here, if the other person lightly parts her tongue, slowly explore the other person's tongue in a light licking motion. <br>  <br>  9. The tongue has a very sensitive surface, which is why tongue to tongue is the essence of french kissing. <br>  <br>  10. After you've tried lightly licking the other person's tongue, you can try sucking on it, wrestling with it ( see if you can hold it to the floor of her mouth ) and other things like that. <br>  <br>  11. Explore the other areas of the mouth. Especially the roof of the mouth. Lightly lick, or tickle the area with your tongue. <br>  <br>  12. Don't bite. whatever you do, don't bite. <br>  <br>  13. Don't swing your tongue round and round like a windmill. Explore lightly, don't drill your way through. <br>  <br>  14. Breathe through your nose. Breathe through your nose. I say again, breathe through your nose. <br>  <br>  15. Follow so far? You can lightly use your hands too, lightly rubbing the other person. Suggestions, along the waist, along the back, the arms, especially the inside of the arm, the neck, maybe running your fingers through her hair. Again, don't cause pain. <br>  <br>  16. Continue kissing.|`|fkchpcHJaa	i like when she puts it on my d!ck, under my boxers of course|`|2wCzsQpMaa	All right  ,, soo  it depends if your standing put your hand around his neck or likee rest them on his chest . if your sitting  tthen sit on his lap and up your arm around him.....   okay dont move your lips to fast if you do then your screwed,,,,, you might get nervous and do that but DONT.  okay   your tounge dont move that fast either and dont use to much of your tounge bc thats gross.    use your lips mstly but dont keep your mouth to closedd and dont start out with your tounge.  and follow what the guy does<br>  <br>   my techniques are to think of like movies ..... and if you think of how they do it then it might help you|`|QlvcSgn0aa	number one rule is dont get sloppy.|`|S2ui6tunaa	YOU DONT WANNA KNOW
r3sinxaVaa	even if he looks at you just ignore him that will bug the mess out of him!|`|sc0tta8zaa	get a new man, that will fill that void...helped me
80brMtcOaa	the thing is though, if he doesnt already like you then the jealousy thing won't work. In order to use that trick the guy has to already like you. Maybe the guy just isnt worth it or maybe you should speak to him about this situation?<br>  GoodLuck<br>  xxx|`|1xnxMAueaa	In my opinion, if you have to make somebody jealous in order for them to want you, it's not meant to be. I know what it's like to like someone who doesn't like you back; I know it hurts, and I know it's very hard to move on. But if you do get together with 'John', your relationship won't be very fulfilling, because it'll be one based on something as dark and dirty as jealousy. I know this sounds hard, not to mention cliche, but what you really have to do is wait: wait for somebody with whom affection is mutual, somebody who likes you for who you are, not for that green monster.
rQoEV3XBaa	Its just coincidence|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Its called life and you need to just hang in there. You will get your in good time. Everything happens for a reason. good luck!|`|inxKRubVaa	If everything you say about he is true, then she's one of those popular people who just seem to know how to get every guy they happen to want, but don't actually take anything seriously. Don't worry, you just haven't been lucky and don't let her get to you. You'll find the right guy eventually, don't settle because then you won't want what you have and you might want something else.

SnWZusBIaa	Don't stay with him if he stil has feelings for his ex. Move on.
syKIxX45aa	Bad idea, it will be uncomfortable in two ways.  The back of a van is not the place, and I am told loosing your virginity for a girl can also be uncomfortable.  So wait till you know him better, then use a bed.|`|DozD8lTGaa	Well.<br>  <br>  Do it when you feel the time is right and when you feel ready. If you feel the time is right whilst you are the back of the van, then that's your choice.<br>  <br>  It's really up to you :) But, i would rather my first time in a bed; BUT, that's my personal opinion... everyone is different. BUT, by the fact you are questioning it, shows you maybe aren't ready and also that you don't feel comfortable doing in the back of a van.<br>  <br>  Tell him that you would rather do it in a better place than a van!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope i helped. X|`|rEFHlhmdaa	in the back of a van? really how classy. At least for your first time you should try and make it something worth remembering. i'm not saying you need a dozen roses and candles every where but make sure it is with some one you want and it is something place you won't cringe about in 10 years. and a van doesn't seem to fit the criteria.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	The fact that you can't even spell 'losing' properly leads me to think that you are too young to contemplate sexual activity. Even if you are not, I don't think the back of a van is the most romantic place in which you could do it.|`|azIJoIdIaa	if you have to question it, then youre not ready.<br>  and no, not in the back of a van or car or truck. have some class.|`|wUQ51VBdaa	dont wait untill your married! god... these people r NUTS! lol<br>  <br>  umm i wouldnt suggest doing it in the back of a van... cant u book into a B&B or motel?? <br>  xx|`|O5KOwhovaa	Go forth and be conquered.|`|HOVvKqxsaa	wait until marriage|`|qPdrXzZzaa	seriously no ... when you lose your virginity you will understand why you defonately do not want to do it in the back of a van or any other place than the comfort f a bed for your first time|`|b13c3Znmaa	in the back of a van are you mad why would you want to be cold and uncomfortable when you could be warm and ecstatic in your time of pleasure but remember where ever you do it always carry a condom and use it.|`|SOXtsPGYaa	A van is no substitute for a decent bed, tell him bed or nothing, can do it in the van later if your into that sort of thing|`|eVEUOGF4aa	Do it if it makes YOU feel comfortable.|`|JJARLh3zaa	why don;t you wait until you're married? it's a much better idea|`|WcioB4JFaa	ummm i would not recomend to back of a van... ever consider a bed?|`|AAexkTAKaa	luurrsh|`|AA11307468	Leave the van for when you are more experienced and just looking for the thrill of someplace unexpected.  In the back of a van is more for a quickie or some other purely lustful experience.  You want your first time to mean something.  If you choose to go ahead with it in the back of the van, I expect you will look back on it as cheap and meaningless.|`|AA12302228	are you northern and love pies|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	The fact you're on here asking us about it makes it clear you're not ok with this.<br>  <br>  This is a very negative view, but all you will do is attempt to create new life through sex. If you're willing to run the risk, you have to be prepared for all possible outcomes, and one of those is pregnancy. If you really can not have a baby right now, then don't do it.<br>  <br>  And in the back of a van....?!|`|AA12050428	No don't wait until you are married. Don't LOSE it not LOOSE it.<br>   <br>  <br>  You LOSE something but your lace comes LOOSE.<br>  There now you've learnt one thing and I hope taken notice of the other.|`|6a809f8f4c97f768092102e120596872aa	noooooooooo at least wait til u have a room and a bed to do it in, its something u will remember for the rest of ur life and u dont want to regret it|`|seMpUL8Kaa	If that's where he wants you to do it, then he has no respect for you. Don't have sex with him.
3otMqevyaa	He is not engaged. <br>  There isn't even a legitimate Rachel Martin that exists...if you pay close attention, that website is a fluke and he stated himself that he is single. <br>  So don't freak out.|`|vlzCukMLaa	omg i i saw that too! i saw it on a site and i totally freaked out! so i'm here on yahoo answers trying to figure out if its true. i really hope hes not =/
Ga2dMpB7aa	Honey, just forget about him. I know breaking up is hard, but if you agreed to break up, there must have been a reason. Just keep that in your head, and you'll be okay. Good luck, sweetie.|`|tmfhieP7aa	Oh my gosh, don't listen to him when he says he still wants to talk to you. He probably does, but he doesn't at the same time. He still wants you, but he wants the freedom of being single. You will get hurt if you keep talking to him, it took me months to learn this. I was depressed whenever I talked to my ex and I kept contact with him and called him every other day, but I finally had the courage to just stop. I haven't talked to him in 2months and finally fell completely over him and am ready to move on. Please listen to me on this I don't want to see you get more hurt, I've been through it and it is a horrible time.
jVjXL6HUaa	Devotion<br>  Trust<br>  Loyalty is key<br>  You never stop thinking about him<br>  You actually talk to him not just infatuate about him|`|jxxWZoHeaa	I know of one sign and one sign only, ok maybe 2:<br>  1.  You wait to see them all day and while ur waiting, u have to try to not think about them, and then once you see them , its like you dont even have to talk to be happy :)<br>  2.  you're always tonguetied and your mind goes blank bc all u see is them and u just cant think of anything to say but: "I love you." :))|`|NvQETTJKaa	You are comfortable and secure in your relationship. You trust that your partner won't hurt you and there is no need of suspicion or jealousy. <br>  <br>  You have remained together through good times and bad. <br>  <br>  Thoughtful things are done just because it makes both of you feel good. <br>  <br>  Neither of you make sacrifices, only compromises. <br>  <br>  Your significant other has told you of their deep feelings, and they are returned. <br>  <br>  Your affections for your partner make you feel special and good about yourself. <br>  <br>  When there is a fight, you usually make up after only a few hours and agree that nothing is more important than both of you expressing your true feelings, even if they cause conflict. <br>  <br>  You and your partner feel no need to test each others feelings or loyalties. <br>  <br>  You can be yourself when with your partner more so than anyone else. <br>  <br>  You've forgotten your ex. <br>  <br>  You can't stop thinking about your partner. <br>  <br>  You care about your significant other more than anything. <br>  <br>  You find your partners quirks charming. <br>  <br>  You have great chemistry. <br>  <br>  You don't notice others as much. <br>  <br>  You love spending time together. <br>  <br>  Other priorities take a backseat. <br>  <br>  You start thinking about your future together.
LMH9rcqUaa	The guys that are on the immature side do that.<br>  I have never experienced that before, but I am pretty sure that would be it.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Some guys might - but only guys that were abusive, immature, stupid jerks!  Stay away from anyone who does that - it is a bad, bad sign!|`|dUglyCKDaa	That's confusing.... I dont think so.. maybe it depends on the guy.
xoXkHOVsaa	If he treated you poorly, then he will treat this girl poorly too.  That kind of behavior catches up with you.  He will end up alone in the end unless he makes some major changes in his life.
9fec6a8704a864b61d3862874ce94967aa	Don't knock having your brother and your mother as close friends. Many of the youngsters who have over the years come and taken refuge in my house would have killed to have a mum and brother who cared enough to be their friend!<br>  <br>  You are changing as well as your friend and while I do understand how lonely you must be feeling just now, I think you have probably outgrown your friend.<br>  <br>  Try and join a group or club with similar interests to yours. Those people will be like minded and you will have more fun. But hold on to that closeness with your family.The stand the test of time!|`|kau1P97Kaa	for your best friend to do that to you that's no friend, she wasn't even your friend in the first place, don't worry about it my friend, your find another friend and maybe lots of mates to be with you who will show you more respect
TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, if i was you i would leave him to it.you and your kids have put up alot from him over the years.so now he has gone, go out and find someone who will treat you and your kids right,and love you/you deserve that.you need to sort your life out,as you are getting older,then you won't feel like doing any think.you deserve more in life than a drunk who is no good for you and your kids.wake up and tell him to sling his hook.|`|mmMgfhf2aa	No, you're settling for less than you want. Get on with your life and write this one off. Move on. You're onto a loser with that one.
a5jAKxQjaa	A good way is to get into the rhythm of the person you are kissing, what are they doing? Remember to swallow! no one likes saliva all over there face lol I went into www.google.com for you, and typed 'how to kiss' and it came up with several sites however I checked out www.howtokiss.info and it looked very good. It tells you about the basics,positioning and other movements etc I hope this has helped. :)

pxlu5Wgqaa	I'm sorry but you should first tell her about your feelings.<br>  If she wants to stop doing this stay with her.<br>  But if she does not admit the things that she does wrong you should end your relationship.|`|pJZBdpehaa	Go play World of Warcraft.|`|T84DbR5Yaa	Have you talked to her about how this makes you feel . She may not realize some of the things that she is doing. After that if there is no improvement then I would consider ending the relationship. So you don't have to be miserable and end up with a broken heart

I'd be pitiful if i told my serious boyfriend that I used to go to parties and make out with dozens of random guys. It would run down my image in the future. sure it's "fun" i guess, until you really find someone you want to devote yourself to.

oOD3dYaNaa	"Do Right" by 3LW =]
FyUu34gTaa	Well, my husband is 14 years younger than me.  I think it bothered me more than others, except for my grown children.  We have only been married since October.  Most people think we are about the same age.  Everyone always thought my daughters were my sisters...I really don't care what other people think.  It has always been acceptable for the man to be much older but not the woman.  The only thing I see is that men are less mature even the older ones... Women are usually more responsible and mature than men their ages, so younger men generally are less mature in some ways.  then some are very mature for their age, I think it depends on the person and if they want to mature.|`|ne7QpCTyaa	Yep.  My first husband was 6 1/2 years younger than me.  He asked me out a few times and I kept turning him down because of his age.  Then he bet me a date on the outcome of a baseball game and my team lost, so we went on a date.  It turns out he was very mature due to circumstances in his life.  After a while we got married, but he passed away after we had only been married 8 months.<br>  <br>  My advice is that if someone truly makes you happy, don't allow age (as long as it's legal) to stand in your way.  Age really is just a number.  Life experiences and character are much more important to me.  (My current husband is 13 years older than me, but we are happy too.)<br>  <br>  And yes, there will be people that comment on the age difference, but who cares!!  Although it did help my case that my first husband didn't look 6 1/2 years younger than me. LOL|`|chENztVEaa	My guy is quite a bit younger than me and we have been living together for six years now and are both happy with our relationship.  He is one of the best things that ever happened to me.  People seem to accept the age difference with no problems but if someone did I would not let it bother me.  It is our lives and we deserve to be happy and have what we want.|`|2bhMmlzHaa	No i haven't I'm 26 i don't date younger men because they haven't made it yet i love financially and mentally secure men<br>  <br>  The men i date are from age 30 to 50 i love their money and experience in bed,|`|xNWqqlcYaa	i would never marry a woman older than me.  cuz when i'm in the prime of my life at 85, she'd be all old and wrinkly at 90.  yuck, who wants that.|`|ssF4GrjGaa	My husband is 14 years older than me. But you would never know we get along great, have tons in common, but we do laugh about it sometimes.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	my husband is 2 years younger than me chronologically but about 30 years older than me mentally.  So noone really knew the difference or had any objections.  I am 33 he's 31...no big deal.<br>  <br>  My dad is 55 and his wife is 26...needless to say I struggled with it but when I saw how happy she made him that's all I needed to know.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I have dated and was even married for a time to a younger man.  I'm not going to generalize and say all younger men are too immature, but all the ones i was with were!  I've made a vow to never date a younger man again.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	I had a boyfriend who was 8 years younger than me and it did not bother us at all. Most people thought that I was the younger one. My husband is 2 years younger than me and most people think that he is the older one. Noone has ever said anything to us and I would not care if they did.|`|EJWphb88aa	I have dated .. its pain  to be with a person younger than you.. coz the understanding always remain nil...<br>  <br>  People's reaction - I really don care...|`|tmeo3diUaa	If you consider having sex as dating then yes.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	My wife married a younger man.  Nobody really cared.
zzaScg0haa	It depends on what state you live in
DAH48qSOaa	yes|`|AA12168155	yes. but. can you like her for the same reasons you are jealous.|`|LtlBILW1aa	yea|`|ZsQRQmzdaa	it all depends on the situation. you should be more descriptive. if she is a snotty person and rubs it in your face well than yes but if she doesn't brag about it and does nothing it is still a little normal to be jealous. dont worry if you are jealous. you should just be happy for your sister because in the end of the day she is all you got.|`|WGVHKF7Aaa	Well depends for what you are jelous about, I have been jelous of my sister for a long time now because she is dating a girl i want to date. Though, Its not fair that you are angry with her, just try to talk whatever is bugging you with her.|`|2lDzUf3waa	why would u want to be jealous of that
f7qVtYfaaa	now is the time to be dating for you so go for it|`|2G8lOPN8aa	If she's rich--she doesn't need your money. :D  But you should focus on your positives... if you are a good-looking stand up guy with good grades and a good personality...why shouldn't you be able to get her attention? Money isn't everything...  and it can't buy you love, right?<br>  <br>  Besides--who knows what YOU will amount to.  You sound like a young guy with your life ahead of you--so it's up to you to make your own fortune... Surely you have potential, right?  If she can't see that, she's not worth your attention.<br>  <br>  Just bite the bullet and ask her out--the worst she can say is no.  A date doesn't have to be an expensive proposition... surely you can afford to take her to a movie... or at least get a pizza and invite her to come over for a movie night at your place.<br>  <br>  Money isn't everything... I wouldn't let it hold you back if I were you.  Life is too short to sit and wait and worry about all the things you don't have.... get up off your a$$ and make it happen for yourself. :)|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	if she doesnt like you the way you are, she isnt worth your time.  thats the truth|`|WSIZKAQcaa	go for it!!

Hopefully, being yourself means that you treat her respectfully and are nice to her.  Don't try to be someone you are not.  You want someone who accepts you as you are. <br>  <br>  If she likes you, great.  If she just doesn't like you because of the way you look or act, that's too bad but at least you tried.  And if she rejects you for no other reason than that you are poor, shame on her--you don't need to be with anyone that superficial anyway.|`|3ekncEpaaa	honestly i would tell her exactly how i feel,, i have gone out with a few of those,,, they usually like up straight guys and people that dont lie... and i am alos poorer then poor so yah just be honest and truthful dont lie and tell her,,, its not like there is anything to lose... you should know your feelings so no matter what your proly not gonna stop liking her|`|s13Lwnq4aa	They like bad boys.<br>  But, being bad and poor is just a stereotype.<br>  LMAO!

How old are you?  If you're old enough, pick up a part time job.  If you're younger, the money really shouldn't have an effect on your relationship.  As you get older, a lot of women look for men with a higher financial status, mainly because their parents tell them that they need to find a man who can take care of them.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I do not look at financial status.  I base my decisions on how the person makes me feel, and the things he would be willing to do for me.  No amount of money can truly make a woman happy, unless that is all she is looking for!|`|C0xoYXDvaa	im sure alot of people would tell you money does not matter, and love conquers all and the crap like that. but the reality is ,like the animal kingdom itz al bout survival of the fittest. and evolution cant change that cuz itz based on that. The female will mate with the strongest competitor. and .. wait... what waz the question again? oh yeah i remember now . juz go for it confidently and a penis the size of mine helps.|`|fmsKNGMEaa	If she likes you, money won't matter.<br>  Figure out if she is interested or not.<br>  If she is, go for it, if not....don't bother.<br>  <br>  Been there, done that, not worth the time if they aren't interested.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|TPuv4vevaa	If she judges you based solely on your bank account, then she's probably not someone you should date anyway.  If she has a genuine interest in you then she will judge you on character and mannerisms.|`|oJ5ztybGaa	thats abosultey fine. dress with what u have, and ask for money for new clothes on holidays.|`|mmks8Dyuaa	lol i don't know man, just be yourself?<br>  don't know why your attracted to preps right now anyways<br>  but yeahhhhhhhhh<br>  goodluck with that ;]
TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, he does not want to rush things,he wants to get to know you better|`|TCpWVW4Raa	No I was basically in this exact same situation and I've been hurt before so I'm pretty defensive and would rather take things slow, but sadly the girl lost interest because of this and moved on and I was gutted because I really liked her.. So if you like him..Keep talking and things will happen adventually.<br>  <br>  I don't think he's got 5 women lined up at all, I realise it can come across and this and now you've said it I wonder if the girl I liked thought the same thing..hmm
y0DYwomYaa	just know your husband is going to be annoyyed you looked at his text messages, and i bet he is afraid to say somthing espically if she is almost his boss... he might just like the attention, tell him about how it makes u feel but dont tell him everything he has done wrong, people dont like to feel jumped on... explain to him your frustration and tell him your not looking ot cut him off from having a life or friends but this one person does bother you because they had a "past" tell him you forgave im for that bcause people do make mistakes but that was hard enough.. she is basically pouring salt in an open woon.. and hopfully if it works out he will understand and avoid her texts and calls maybe she will get the hint, or he will grow some b+++s and tell her to go away, when everything is all and done try textin your husbandd more, set up alone time, go out, do somthing fun always change things up, just because your married does not mean the fun stops!!|`|BJERgbM5aa	So far, he's not cheating.  And you have no proof that he is!  She is obviously trying to 'get' him again.  But it looks like he wants no part of it.  But he is slightly playing along with her platonically.  Why?  She's kind of his boss right.  Maybe he doesn't want to jeopardize his job.  And he's keeping all that from you to avoid problems with he and you.  I think you're to one with the issues and you should let it go.  At least tell him exactly how you feel.  Reading his text's is just what you don't need.|`|oAPSJnSEaa	I had the same issue and I dumped that individual because they continued. My now bf did a semi sorta same thing and I brought it to his attention and let him know that if he wants to continue with this type of behavior then I'll just move on. He stopped -_- and if he was ever to do it again I would leave. Being in a relationship takes too people if one person isn't pulling their weight and being deceitful then you need to ship out. Plus if you are serious about your relationship why have contact with people who you have either screwed/dated/or had strong feelings for. That's like laying crack on a table in front of someone who just got outta rehab!|`|AA11988692	this is bad.  let him know how u feel, be a little more aggressive. tell him if he's shrugging it off then he doesn't respect u like u thought he did. the jokes might be for his ego so tell him that u love him so much so why does he need that? if he keeps doing it then ask if anything is going on.|`|3rbjxxCnaa	In my opinion this situation is unacceptable, especially if they have had any type of Intimate relationship. Ask your boyfriend if he would be okay with it if the roles were switched? Im pretty sure we both know what the answer would be. NO!!|`|07db33e9bb70a2df8cc87375eab04cbcaa	that is totally wrong!! if he cares about you, he would have ended it with her completley including the texts and phone calls. tell him how you feel and tell him to choose, you'll be able to tell if he's still seeing her. good luck, you deserve better girl|`|AA10785364	No its not right, If you break up with him though, he's gonna play cry baby with you so you can get back together, which is going to put you on the spot to feel sorry for him. If your really strong, you'd let him go, because he's the type that will be like that for years to come with diff. women. Dont feel sorry, there are better guys and you deserve better. :)<br>  im open if your interested lol|`|6e6ETzclaa	well you can't tell if he has fellings for her,but it might be that he just can't push her back bicause shes his boss. This happends a lot. If you realy want to find out if he likes her,you should ask hem.Yes ,it is wrong .|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Your gut instinct is usually right on the money. So tell him to tell her to back off. And if he continues to play with her, you need to get rid of him. Defiantly Not Ok!|`|TnHKoM2naa	That is not okay you need to question him and tell him you dont like it/|`|oB1WQJHgaa	he is messing with her. brake up with him. just an honest answer... :)|`|AA11080680	Man that sucks. It sounds like the 2 of you have trust issues, it will not get any better if he does not cut all ties with this person. Also she needs to grow up and stop contacting your boyfriend. The best thing is, is for you to sit down with him face to face than you can look him in the eyes and tell if he is being honest. If he is not willing to work with you on this situation than you need to leave. Trust me you will always be wondering in the back of your mind if he is telling you the truth. And you will always be questioning him. Not a healthy relationship. Move on and you will find that special someone. Good luck.|`|bc885ef289e7c5824b4a15299caa923baa	the real question here is do you think hes doing something wrong? if your r being hurt by him just let all your feelings out at him dnt keep em in confront him in a way that will make him cry or really guilty and ask him wat is going on with him and this "girl" if they had a sexual past something has to be going on....try to take my advice on this i had experience with this type of situation do wats best for you and him
FtMcjPeaaa	be patient, don't give up and be yourself.<br>  <br>  be patient if she rejecting you, keep trying and don't give up to persuade her and be yourslef all the way....<br>  <br>  how cold or hard hearted the girl, if you keep coming at her, comforting her and make her believe you then she will fall to you one day~~<br>  <br>  good luck~~<br>  ^_^|`|fkchpcHJaa	woo her
0ktcvglRaa	Unless she sleeps around a lot or has had a lot of sexual history, she's not a slut. Let her know that the person who called her a slut was just saying that because they're jealous of her! She should feel happy to have someone like you. The person who called her a slut is probably just lonely and bitter.|`|vja4ddNmaa	Tell her straight out that she is your girl and nobody else's and you don't want your girl to be thinking such foolish things.Trust me, if she is loyal she will listen up and if she really is what you are describing it will piss her off. Remember, if she gets pissed off when you say it then you know.|`|EdidZdtlaa	tell her that she shouldnt worry about it if she knows that shes not one. people are always gonna call her names and she just has to get over it and stop being depressed. that dosent make things any better. but as long as she knows shes not a .... then she has nothing to worry about. she shouldnt care what people think about her.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Just tell her that person knows what button to push with her, and to not let them have that effect on her, if she is not sleeping around, then how can she be one? Just support her as much as you can.|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	Tell her you think she's awesome the way she is now. I'm sure you can find other ways to reinforce this.<br>  <br>  I'd avoid saying "you're not a slut!", not only does it sound like you're just giving a knee-jerk "right answer" to her, but if she feels like she's a slut and you're saying that she's not, you'd be giving the idea that you'd think badly of her if she was. <--- likely not true, but some girls do get that contrived. <br>  <br>  I object to that term, double standards/sexuality isn't bad and all that jazz.|`|tmfhieP7aa	Girls let things get to their head like that. Just tell her that you love her (only if you do of course) and that she is not a slut because she doesn't sleep around and that that other girl is stupid. My ex called me a slut and a bunch of other things and I actually convinced myself that I was but deep down I knew I wasn't so the hurtful feeling went away. Just don't bring it up (after you comfort her that one time) and she will forget about it sooner or later.|`|TLim2pBTaa	Just be there for her and let her know not to listen to what other people say. It doesn't matter what other people think about her all that matters is what she thinks of herself and what her family thinks about her. People outside her family don't count and they don't have the right to judge her. Maybe she shouldn't be around those people.|`|x7uYAPaSaa	All you can do is you know she isnt and that you love her for her. She might just be a little low on confidence for a bit.

8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	Dude, if you're the ex, you have a duty and responsibility to shake her off.  <br>  <br>  She is married, and unless you are happy with being the other man, the one that came between a marriage and the cause of a divorce, you need to be man enough to tell her the truth -- I loved you, but not enough to marry you.  This man loves you, married you, is committed to you, and you are simply torn between the grass being greener over here.  Water your lawn and make it grow.<br>  <br>  If she's willing to leave her husband for you, how much more quickly is she going to be willing to leave you in the future?  She's already shown she can't be committed to the man she MARRIED, so how is she going to be committed to you?<br>  <br>  If this was all a ploy to get you, do you really want a woman who would go through such extremes to manipulate you?<br>  <br>  If you loved her enough to marry her THEN, why didn't you?  IF you weren't ready THEN, what makes you think you're ready NOW?  <br>  <br>  When a man is ready to marry, he finds a wife.  He quits fooling around with the serial monogamy, he finds a woman who will fit the bill, and he marries her.  There is no "let's wait eight or nine years to find out first, he snatches her up.  Men who know what they want get it when they see it, and they don't let a little thing like a ring stand in their way.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, dude, but whether this relationship works out in the end or not is none of your business, and if it does not, you should not be the guy to pick up her pieces.  If she is ever going to learn to be happy with her choices, she will need to do that for herself, and the old familiarity will not help her, it will hurt her.  <br>  <br>  Cowboy up and walk on.   She is NOT the girl for you.  Whether or not she is the girl for him remains to be seen, but she is definitely NOT the girl for you.|`|AA11806606	Any person who jumps into a marriage for the sake of being married is doomed from the start.  Very immature and probably has a low self esteem.  This marriage won't last.  I feel sorry for both of these idiots who put up with her.  Sooner or later she will end up cheating and desiring the other person and killing her marriage.  What guy would want to be involved with this type of person.  Definitely a "taker" who settled for something less and will always regret it and eventually destroy her marriage, hurting many people.  She will get what she deserves.|`|KasFZL7laa	sounds like it is doomed to fail.  it depends on how dedicated she is to her husband.  by the sounds of it, she doesn't seem to be that dedicated or she wouldn't continue conversation with her ex.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	i would say nothing ever is going to work out for this woman because she's an idiot and idiots have a way of screwing up their lives and everyone elses around them.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	wow sounds like a soap opera in the making.|`|pOTigVYPaa	This marriage can work out but only if she completely breaks off all communication with her one time love.  She did make a mistake but it's one she can live with.  She obviously wanted marriage and the ex didn't.  So, now she's married.  She got what she thought she wanted.  She can fall in love with her husband if she chooses.  It's easy to love someone who is good to you.  She could have eventually married the ex and found life with him to be painful.  Let dead dogs lie.|`|RBRq8406aa	I would say doomed in general because sounds like she got married to be married not because of any sort of love (feelings). If I am correct with the previous statement then she really needs to just get a divorcee and let both men find a women that loves them and that they want to marry. She needs to find someone that she wants to spend rest of life with and then marry because it really sounds like she has done it the other way around. Could be wrong so all of this is based on my first stament.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	anything is possible when it comes to the heart,but this woman is head strong she thinks more with her head than with her heart.so if her new husband is really a great guy, then she will make it work, she has already decided, but if he is a jerk she will leave him.<br>  but the funny thing is that the ex still won't marry her, he is only wanting her back because he can't have her. and if he can't have her, it makes him want her even more, <br>  on the other hand, if she leaves her new husband because he is a jerk. she still won't marry the ex because by that time, she will decide that marrage isn't everything she thought it was, and she will decide to stay single for a while and not rush into anything that big again because now she is smarter than that
ina2jZ5Saa	no its not, and most girls I know, aren't like that. those girls are shallow anyway, why would you even care what they think? The real girls, who are worth something, don't give a sh*t how much money a guy has. Just know, its not all of us, only a few of us who are too self-absorbed and lazy to just make their own damn money. =)|`|6kAtYLAdaa	well this answer depends slightly on how old you are. if your in high school then thats dumb because theres plenty of fun things you can do for free. but if your older... well come on!  money matters the girl wants to end up with someone she's secure with and who isnt a bum or has a low class job. the country is in recession which means money is more important than ever.  tough noogies.  get a good job.|`|naEk1QkSaa	That is not completely true! not ALL girls are like that! Only the shallow ones! So plz don't blame ALL girls!<br>  <br>  Oh yea the answer is those girls are self centered jerks that only care about money!<br>  <br>  I kno it is SOOOOOO stupid!|`|PNdtSrgZaa	okay... that is so stupid!  not all girls are like that! only the self centered jerks and that is not how they should act.  dont blame all girls cause we are not all like that!!!|`|kEqM8oj3aa	It's not fair at all, but obviously she is not anyone you want to be around. Or do you? You may be a great guy, so would you consider this girl great. I wouldn't you can do better than that, so much better. And most girls don't care about money, they may like the idea of a man being successful in himself, and some girls like the idea of being financially secure.|`|kYfoa03haa	I don't think it is fair. Girls who only care about money tend to be fake and shallow. Money is not that important. As long as you have a place to live and clothes on your back than that is really all money is important for. Fancy cars and expensive clothes don't make you who you are and sometimes that is all stuck up girls see. A really great girl won't see dollar signs when she looks at you.|`|satoCRC6aa	she is only thinking of herself<br>  not fair but, she is a girl and subject to change her mind at any point it time and for any reason she chooses.|`|ZzfLnSjUaa	i dnt think the guy has to have alot of money i think itss ok if the guy has enough money to buy u cute little things, like sum that show that it comes from the bottom of his heart<br>  <br>  nd no it aint fair for a girl to turn u down jst cuz u dnt got money
gNfkzw9Saa	You asked <br>  Should you go back to him? Answer NO<br>  Should you trust him? Answer NO<br>  Is he playing you? YES!!!<br>  <br>  You dont want to live a life with someone that you cant trust.<br>  You are putting too much effort into a relationship that is going nowhere because the other half is just simply not interested.<br>  Its true, when he runs out of people to talk to and life seems lonely, the only person he knows that will be waiting for his phone call is you. This is because you are letting this happen.<br>  This guy is a scum, and he is taking advantage of you.<br>  Why are you sitting around wasting your time with this guy when there are many guys out there that would never VIRTUALLY cheat on you with other girls and saying that they are single. Its soo unfair to you and I really hope that you will just end this relationship that you dont have, with this guy. Let him go out and play others. But dont let him to do it to you. Leave him - He isnt trust worthy.
A1xOf1O9aa	dude if you bang your chick by phone then hey-do it.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Some people do it, some don't. You don't have to be in a ldr to have phone sex. There is nothing wrong with phone sex, if you feel comfortable witch each other, go ahead and do it.|`|wdNl0BB6aa	phone sex. its normal yes.<br>  me and my ex did it..just when your in the mood it really helps.
3a8d2a1828c01a0871e1f800150ea1e0aa	just ignore him when he flirts with you, don't flirt back cause that will keep him more interested.|`|qsbhdi1raa	be like look here CHILD (emphasize this word) you need to stop trying to hit on me cause it ain't working.|`|VfWbiw1kaa	FART OR THREATEN TO GET YOUR REALLY MEAN COUSIN TO F*** HIM UP, EVEN IF YOU R LYING|`|Jhr68T0baa	TELL HIM TO **** OFF AND SAY IM NOT INTERESTED.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Kick him in the crotch!|`|c8NNxwjtaa	Kick him in the balls and yell at him to stay the **** away
fRIEHBJOaa	first of all, they ARE not living a happy life. obviously he was cheating on her with you, so how happy can they be? he's the same dude, so he's just playing both of you.<br>  <br>  second of all, you are NEVER going to be happy with him because he's a liar and a cheater, so get that out of your head.<br>  <br>  third of all, accept that the relationship is OVER and move on. just get out there and do you. love yourself, with or without a man, and trust me, good men will come runnin'. you dont have to settle<br>  <br>  fourth of all, dont ever be a "silly me" again. learn girl. learn.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	i wifed a girl once too.  didn't work out for me neither.....|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	This so called man isn't worth your time. He's a player and a cheat. He's not a good father if he shows that sort of example on how to treat women. If his heart wasn't in it then and again, it won't ever be in it. Move on and be happy with someone who deserves you. The best revenge is happiness.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Find another heart to attach to.
SxaSQFZGaa	search it youtube, seriously :P|`|5UlD5mVpaa	"He's about 15?"<br>  Do you mean to say that you don't even know how old your boyfriend is?
wNU62ZELaa	yes that a excuse i do that lot of times.If he talk to u alot he like you.
PA7LbQyRaa	It looks like she is totally the one at fault, she can't be doing this kind of stuff, if i know flirty girls (which i do) if you put them in a situation with some booze and your boyfriend is there then it usually has a bad result. Tell her to pound salt up her *** if she crosses that line, get a new friend you dont wanna be thinking about that all the time and it sounds like other people will support your decision.|`|JUvOKsevaa	Maybe you should get new friends, unless you like that kind of company.  Tell her it makes you uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  But if your boyfriend encourages her behavior in any way, then tell him you do not appreciate that, and if he continues to allow her flirting with him, maybe you should get a new boyfriend as well.  Your friend probably wouldn't do that, unless she thought your boyfriend would possibly give in to her.|`|kcbEWzYwaa	Well if he's feeding into her flirting then you need to confront both of them. However, should probably still confront your friend. She's not being a very good friend by doing what shes doing. <br>  <br>  When I was in high school, I was dating this guy and my best friend started flirting with him at one of our school dances. I confronted both of them at the same time. Yeah we broke up and my friend and I didn't talk for a few days. Come to find out he was already cheating on me with some other girl. So it was for the better that we broke up. <br>  <br>  So I know how you feel. Good luck!
eGpOIV12aa	ask him what the work handbook policy is on dating within the company. that you like someone and not sure if you could date this person. that you are single and how it is to be single.

Remember things you don't have to chew like apple sauce, yogurt, and ice cream.<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  Who ever said you had to go out to diner for a date?<br>  <br>  Try a movie, golfing, bolling, watching a movie @ home( with no popcorn)<br>  <br>  And if they really like you for who you are then this phobia shouldn't matter. They would chew the food for you lol jk|`|NVg06Egwaa	That's unusual, but not like creepy imo. If the guys truly likes you he should be able to see past your flaws, as you see past his (believe me, everyone has flaws!!!).  And you might not be alone, I know a guy that sort of does that type of thing. But it's a little different. <br>  <br>  If it's hurting you, please go see the doctor, this could hurt you badly in the long run.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SEyRe6Eaaa	It's sorta weird but I mean that's who you are and when you date someone they should understand that.

Maybe a trip to a doctor - there may be medications out there that could help you.  Some things we just can't control and the harder we try the worse they get.  Have you ever talked to a doctor about it?|`|wX46Gv4naa	yes and I'm not trying to be funny but I think you should see a therapist about that, But there is someone out there for everybody. So if it doesn't get better someones is out there who won't mind I bet|`|oY1YzPMzaa	Sorry but that is totally creepy and weird|`|oAPSJnSEaa	I would feel awkward...and ask you are you ok and probably not call you.|`|GpNxs1ggaa	kinda weird .. but everybody has a flaw ;)<br>  you could just make a joke out of it and if this really bugs you, you could get help :)

There is a BIG difference. <br>  <br>  You need to wait until you are ready to commit yourself to a mature, monogamous relationship. Momentary pleasure is fleeting.  You need to have self respect and self worth.  <br>  <br>  Don't feel pressured just because "everyone else is doing it".  So what?  You set your own rules and boundaries. Don't be like everyone else, be yourself.|`|ShKAcU2yaa	What makes it good is being with a person you really love, feel connected to & comfortable with.

Never FASHION OBSESSED, because trust me, the fashion obsessed, only a few can pull it off. But it's more of the personality. Funny, nice, not shy, and flirty. Those are the qualities to strive for.

Try to stay in the relationship as long as you can because like it or not you are officially a father. Your child is going to need you (a father figure) in his/her life. You should probably start saving money so that you can help to raise the child. Remember its not only you with the problem but she too is going through really big changes. Be understanding and get ready for some meltdowns. Pregnancies cause a lot of hormone imbalance but with time they get balanced again. As far as illegalities, I don't think you can get fined but you might if she decides to under the cause of "Rape". I'm not sure about this. Sorry<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and please don't take confusion or anger on your child.<br>  <br>  God bless.<br>  <br>  ps.Have you by any chance talked to her about adoption?
G7ngqtQdaa	Talk to him and be flirty. "Accidentally" brush by him when he's near, smile a lot, laugh a lot (or giggle, which ever isn't too loud or weird), and just be a nice person.<br>  <br>  Try being his friend. Remember, guys are just as sensitive as girls are, they just don't show it. Treat them like you would for any of you other girl friends. Don't be like those other girls who try to be mean, thinking a boy will like them for that. ( also, if your gonna play hard to get, don't push it too far. he might think you don't like him ) <br>  <br>  Talk to him about everything. <br>  <br>  When you can be comfortable around him, and he starts talking to you too, let him get to know you. Get his email or AIM so you can talk to him at all times possible. (try not to seem stalker-ish or desperate)<br>  <br>  Then, (this usually works best over IM or some sort of chat) <br>  ask him who he likes. If he does turn out to like you back, then he'll be hesitant to tell you. <br>  <br>  Offer to tell him who you like in exchange for him telling you who he likes. <br>  <br>  (only do this if your willing to, and your pretty sure he likes you back)<br>  <br>  if he says he likes another girl then be happy for him.<br>  it isn't the end of the world. you'll get over him and you'll find someone  else to like. <br>  <br>  BUT if he does like you, then yay happy ending :)<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|rbyxbzh7aa	Go up to him and say hi run into him "accidentaly" something like that, but there is No way of making a guy like you, they just have too. so my advice to you is to be friendly and dont act like a creeper|`|vP3Tu9SVaa	Just talk to him and     get to know each other.

I did it with my best guy friend which was kinda a relief because although we weren't dating I knew he really cared about me -still does- and he wasn't going to force me if i changed my mind.

9a506c84f370dbf2fecea59b04578a36aa	he seems to be changing, unfortunately, and if he keeps going back to his bad ways than maybe it's just time to end this relationship. I know that you want things to be the way they used to, but this world isn't perfect and sometimes we just have to face up to change and try and accept it. there are plenty of fish in the sea, darling, even if he wasn't the right one. you will find the right one.<br>  good luck!|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Then it's over.

BbT3DCHvaa	Keep yourself busy. Answer questions on Yahoo, go out with friends and family, take up a new hobby or spend time on your favorite hobby. Time is going to be the only thing that will truly help. In the mean time stay busy. Good luck!|`|0SREhTB2aa	Just do things that takes your mind off this guy.<br>  Spend a lot of time with friends.<br>  Talk to the one person you trust about all of this.<br>  Keep busy by taking up a sport or anything.<br>  But I dont think being with his friend will make anything better|`|Qe95LNxYaa	time heals all the wounds i took me almost 1 year to get over a girl|`|54296hcbaa	get under someone else|`|IAIBzgOgaa	you're pretty cold hearted, dumping him for his friend.

HNAVlwV7aa	u find it hard to stop smiling. and your cheeks may feel hot.|`|H6GIYDdzaa	It's really quite easy to know the difference, you're just lying to yourself about it.
77A0tlKtaa	wegied I've been pantsed so many times everyone thinks its normal to see me in my underwear haha jk wedgies just seem more embarassing to me!|`|AA11307468	Well, if I was going to be experiencing this, being pantsed would be more embarrassing as I frequently go commando.|`|EdidZdtlaa	i think pantsed is more embarrased|`|JgEhGpydaa	PANTSED!<br>  answer my question! and tell wat u think of me!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090306141024AAoGjN5&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|i4ARGkHQaa	pantsed omg|`|uFLZ4GOLaa	if u had them at the same time duh if sum1 panted u wen u hav a wedgie|`|VyPIMvDfaa	Hmm.. theyre both pretty embarassing.<br>  l0l depending on what underwear im wearing that day and such. being pantsed might be more embarassing.. not to mention the fact that your pantiess might go downn w/ your pantss :o  that wouldnt be good <br>  <br>  uhm but wedgies are quite odd.. aand embarassing.. <br>  so id say wedgies.. depending on the situation and such lmao!|`|dsuXOaRraa	Getting my pants pulled down is much more embaressing, I would have to say.
71VRvldJaa	It appears you are more interested in him than he is in you!  If he was interested and wanted to see you or stay in contact, you would have heard from him!  <br>  You told him if he wanted to hang out with you to text you....he hasn't!  That's your answer!|`|ak0T96CQaa	As a guy, I never really feel tempted to text my female friends. I prefer to talk to them in person as opposed to texting/calling/Fackbook chat.
S23ObJFhaa	This guy obviously isn't good enough if he keeps ending it with you. It might be hard getting over him but it doesn't seem like he treats you right. I think moving on would be a good idea. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
cTJa8FZYaa	youre obsessed with someone? maybe get some help or break up with your boyfiriend|`|EdidZdtlaa	i think its probably just a crush that you'll get over. its probably just lust that your feeling for him and nothing more. but i think you should be careful because you might end up  really liking that other dude and your bf might end up getting hurt.|`|zbEIld3Iaa	You sound really young.  You will be "obsessed" with a lot of guys I'm sure.  Once you mature, you will hopefully learn the difference between love, obsession, and infatuation.  Your relationships will become more serious, and you will eventually see the difference.
QT7Gffwbaa	U gotta b 18 though....|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	first of all why would u want a dating website when ur only 13? u could go out with me if ur hot. phone number.....|`|XU1fftrMaa	Ermm your freaqin 13.

mrysAOpGaa	yes, messing around with someone before you actually start dating just makes you look vulnerab le and easy, and that youre eventually willing to go further.  Dont let him know youll givein that easy because sooner or later hell expect more.|`|ZKcg7YV8aa	It really depends on the person you are messing around with. Could be a good guy who is going to take you seriously and you are going to pursue a relationship with him and everything, but then it could also be a player who just want to "mess around" with anyone. Be careful.|`|LVkfPZq0aa	I think so. I had sex with a guy I liked and the next day he stopped talking to me, I'd becareful so that you don't get hurt.|`|PS83gPGoaa	depends wot u mean by messin around|`|AXrOrIQ2aa	Might send the wrong message to the guy that your easy and thats all you want..|`|AA12050428	What exactly are you asking?<br>  <br>  Do you know I am  a native English speaker but the language on here could be Swahili, I just don't understand it anymore.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	Wha'ts "messing around"? Getting to second or third base? "Before" the dating period? It's all kind of vague.
dFHsAXDMaa	back away if he is willing to leave her for you ........ he will leave you for someone else eventually too|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	he is using you, duh!!<br>  <br>  he has a g/f!! enough said. He must know that you are so GULLIBLE to stick around.|`|IXskJPlVaa	If you like him - you can continue with the relationship - just as good friends - no expectations. Also don't ever go over-board - everything in limits. That way you'll always be good friends even if the relationship doesn't go beyond the friends level and you wont have any bad feelings either. Best of luck.|`|Qz4n1l0zaa	leave him. find someone else who is not confused.|`|YxOWoBZYaa	he just want both not worth leave him u can do better|`|dat8eoYyaa	peace out|`|kEqM8oj3aa	yeah, I think this guy is using you. He's got two girls. He's manipulating you. Does he tell the other girl about you? I'd call it quits. Either way, he'll still have someone to fall back on. He doesn't love you. Well he may think he loves you, but he is not IN LOVE with you.|`|pW8Kv4GGaa	Well I think you should leave him because he said he has that girl friend i think you shouldn't let any guy play around with you like that. its not worth your time to stick around and find out who he likes.|`|wu4K4jWdaa	hes using you. sorry hun.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AipNdGgaXvJxwxfQvjsphhjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227084605AA9mWxi">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would remain friends with him until he can make up his mind and he should respect you for making this decision.
IPS3hWweaa	Knowing that you've slept with 30 guys I'd just want to be 31. Condoms would get a work out.<br>  <br>  But yeah, you're a slut and knowing that I wouldn't date you, you'd be just a sex toy. Sorry, but you shouldn't have soiled yourself like that.|`|POHWTDPRaa	I find your question redundant and repetitive.<br>  <br>  Oh, yeah. You have a problem.

That's pretty active. OK, it's just a survey but in the UK, a recent study reported that the average woman aged 21 had slept with 9 guys. I'm sure that is a lot more than it used to be! (Where were those girls when I was young? Lol)<br>  <br>  Some girls go through a bit of a 'mad phase'. Congrats, obviously you know how to get a guy interested. Try saying NO for a change! It's about time you had a relationship that lasts more than half an hour!<br>  <br>  It doesn't really matter what other people think about you but it is up to you to build up you self-esteem. It may be you are confusing being loved with having lots of sexy guys shagging you!<br>  <br>  No I wouldn't judge you harshly but you need to be aware of the health implications for yourself and future partners. I would recommend you get checked out at a sexual health clinic. You will pay a hefty price if you continue your current lifestyle. So take care now!|`|W3bELVbmaa	wouldnt most guys be scared to get a sexually transmitted disease off you? my god yes your a slut, and Im NOT sorry for saying it. get yourself sorted love, 30 guys aged 18 is the worse ive ever heard of. your legs must be sore, what with being open all the time...<br>  <br>  jeez :/|`|zQheOHReaa	im sickened by you. sleeping with 30 guys would certify you as  a whore.you have a big problem, you need to talk to a therpist or something.|`|B9dONyROaa	Lame attempt at trolling! attention Wh ore!|`|TrmGBloHaa	wow , why cant we meet :)
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	all of your friends have grown up, moved on, and not interested in being single anymore. maybe u need to find a way to do the same. love may be a disaster for u because the people your age don't want to settle for someone who is immature, there comes a time when u have to give up the things that are immature and decide what it is u really want from life. at 26 the people u use to hang with have changed and u stayed the same.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Don't worry, half of them will be divorced within 10 years.

Start by going to your college website and see if there are any alumni gatherings in you area.  Join some clubs in the area.  Meetup.com is a good place to join local clubs separated by city.  They have wine clubs, reading clubs, all kinds of things, even coffee drinkers.  And, research local churches in your area for who focuses on singles and visit it.  There are plenty of people your age that are in the same boat.  Remember, you have to be happy with yourself before you can even think to make someone else happy.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	How I wish I was 26 again AND single!! <br>  <br>  You don't need someone to be happy! You have to be happy on your own and that will attract tons of people!<br>  <br>  You're going about this the wrong way! who wants to be with someone as desperate as you are!<br>  <br>  I felt the same way when I divorced 4 years ago, I thought I was no one without a man in my life...boy did I change since then!! I spent those last few years doing what I wanted, when I wanted, spent my days in my pajamas if I wanted or at the shopping mall if that's what I was wishing. No need to go home to fix dinner, no excuse for being late, I watched the shows I wanted on tv!!! <br>  <br>  Sure I'd like to meet someone, and I will eventually but till then! I am not going to look miserable! In fact I'm gonna look my best, I'm gonna smile, have fun and do fun things cause when that special man sees me, I want him to see the real me....not the depressed me.<br>  <br>  About being single and 43?|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Do something to get out of that state of mind. You have pretty good chances to find the right person before 30. There are lots of thing to do, lots of places to go, lots of people to meet. You should be in some grade of exciting expectations of what`s coming on in your life. Life starts at 30`s so they say. I met my husband when I was 28 and he was 31,,,it was the best we could do. we have a good marriage and all my friends that married before are divorced,,,when I was 26 I  had the whole world under my feet!..It is truly the way how you feel in your mind. Try to do something new, distract your mind from dark thinking, the world out there is full of expectations and excitement!!. And we`re your friends,,,if that is not enough.|`|cce40468b79d350af3a0e1388f5dd17eaa	What you are feeling is normal. When we see those close to us making life changes, we tend to want the same for yourselves. What you must do is think about the joys you have. Man you are single, with no kids, no husband....WTF!!! Do you and be happy. So much comes with titles! Go out, and if you can't find anyone to enjoy your evening with, go out by yourself. Get all done up in your fliest attire, go to a bar or (where ever you prefer), and just have a ball. More than likely you will meet someone else you is single. whether it be a male or female. While still keeping your longtime friends, work on building new relationships with others who you have somethings in common (no kids, no spouse). <br>  <br>  Another thing, please, please, please, don't try to fall in love. Love comes without any attempts. That's why it's called "fall" in love...we can't control that (in most cases anyway). You might wanna use this time to make sure you are becoming the person you would like to marry. Again....become the person you would like to marry. How you going to look for someone who is honest, loving, goal oriented, and eating (winking), if you are not these things. Trust me when love comes knocking at your door,  you want to welcome it not run it off. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	One of my old highschool friends didn't get married until she was 40. She just wasn't willing to settle until a guy came along that was truly deserving of her and knew how to treat her...and was compatible with her, etc. Don't worry so much about being single. Keep busy and take up new hobbies. You never know what tomorrow will bring. If you can't be happy alone, you won't be happy long term in any relationship. I know this from my own experience!|`|xNWqqlcYaa	if you are a guy you sound like a real pussy.  if you are a girl and are hot and as desperate as you sound you should call me....|`|fLU63N4kaa	Fine, go kill yourself. Be a coward. Don't have the courage to live!|`|fsElHa74aa	Your fine ....dont dwell on it when your not looking for it the right person will come along...there is a great saying in spanish... better off by yourself than in bad company!!!!
27af90e0f6dfc8baff90052bd5ee1e76aa	you should probably give her time. she may not know how to answer to it yet, especially if this is the first time you've told her. give her a couple of days, if after that she doesn't, send another email, explaining how she makes you feel, tell her everything, let her know you are serious. if she don't reply to that one either,....well she may not feel the same. good luck!!!!|`|UuCblv3Caa	I think it is so sweet that u told her dat u told her u love her. Actually, i thnk it's hot<br>  <br>  Ru sure she didn't read it? Well , wen she writes u an email, take 3-4  days 2 answer her abck. She jsut probably doen't wanna mess up on her response so she doesm;t wanna look stupid.|`|pW8Kv4GGaa	I think you should give her a little more time to think about what you told her she probably wasn't ready to hear what you told her|`|Jhr68T0baa	Clearly youve scared her off...|`|QIYHApEkaa	Get over it and move on!|`|UwnXYMI4aa	lol...ur a flaming homo.
IPS3hWweaa	Maybe, it depends on the way you said no. If it was kind of a joking way and I didn't believe you, then yes, I would call.<br>  <br>  But if you said it rather seriously and had a mean or unfriendly look on your face when you said it, then no, I wouldn't call because I would think that you're playing head games.
5SCD87hTaa	Hunting trips and strip clubs should not go together. if they did i would be scared. if your hubby does not want you to go to a strip club then you shouldn't. you should be able to hang out with your friends but some guys think that strip clubs are a form of cheating. pick out another activity for you and you girlfriends to do an don't get in a fight over this. you don't see hunting as a form of cheating on you but how would you feel if he went to a female strip club.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	How are the two connected, they are totally different events.  Does hubby also go tittie barring when he's hunting?|`|3SSVBJAqaa	I don't see why not, unless you don't let him go to strip club, that would be just hypocritical of you.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Shouldn't a mature adult be able to work this out with thier partner instead of polling a bunch of nameless, faceless strangers?<br>  <br>  Take responsibility for your own marital issues and talk to your husband.  Good grief.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Absolutely!  Just make sure that your husband takes pictures of his buddies giving him lap dances and putting dollar bills in his thong.  Fair is fair.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	This is so lame.<br>  <br>  Most of these questions just make me grateful to have a REAL man, and a REAL marriage.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Absolutely! When are we going!!|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	I'm not sure the two are exactly analogous.  Mind you, I would have no problem with my wife going to watch male strippers if I was away.  But, the question really should be how you would feel if, while out hunting with his friends, they decided to go to a strip club and watch some young ladies dance?|`|AA10526402	Those aren't really comparable activities...it is more like you would go on a weekend shopping/spa trip with your friends.  If it was the other way around and he said that you go shopping with your friends so he should go to the strip club with his; that wouldn't make sense either.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	A male strip club is much different than a female one. They do some pretty crazy stuff at those, and the guys are totally nude, not just topless like most of the ones with women. Also fishing is way different than looking at naked guys.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Sure why not?  He is watching those guys strip for bed and take a whiz, you should get to watch guys too?   Ask him, and see what he thinks, what we think, doesn't really matter.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Yes, if he's going to strip clibs on his hunting trip, else no.|`|0AShsMsoaa	is he hunting strippers?|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Why not? as long as you just watch.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	yep. what do you think he's really doing all weekend long? Sitting in a tree?|`|3555fff279e4273808a32f0c6033ec7aaa	I am married and I go hunting and have been to a strip club or two. I don't see a problem with it but if he is not comfortable with it then that is something I think you should respect. On the flip side, if you express that you don't like him going hunting every weekend or some other activity he should respect that. Your relationship should be strong enough to sit down and have this conversation. <br>  <br>  If you can't sit down and talk about this then I think its time to reevaluate. Good luck.|`|xPZm0Mxlaa	My wife and I have the same problem.I go hunting and she likes to go to drink at bars with her friends.I don't have any problem with her going and doing things with the girls I just don't want her to do things as if she were single.When I go hunting or fishing that's all I do I don't bring women up to camp with me. I would be fine with her go to movies,shopping, bar/restaurant for lunch or dinner , women's get to gathers I think if you want to be single and have that kind of life then why are you married in the first place.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Hunting and going to strip joints are 2 different things. If he goes and does innocent things with his buddies on weekends, you should be able to do innocent things with your girlfriends.....BUT....ALWAYS put each other first and make sure you get COUPLE time. That's MOST important in keeping a marriage strong.|`|6BSHkiugaa	Yes and do not let him tell you differently.  When I was first married mine told me he was going on a week long golf trip.  However when I said if he did I would go on a seperate trip as well.  He then said no he would not go.  You see many men want to come and go and have little wife at home doing the chores with no money while they drink, go to strip clubs, and call it golf.  Put your foot down now.  Whats good for him is good for you!!|`|8zd6OqJ5aa	Ummm I'm going to be completely honest. That's dishonest on your part.<br>  <br>  Why would you do that to your husband? Would you be ok with him doing that to you? and if he already has then I think you 2 have some talking to do...<br>  <br>  It can depend on the couple but I think that's dishonest, especially to someone who is suppose to be the love of your life...|`|8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	How do you equate one with the other?  What does hunting have to do with strippers -- or excuse me . . . 'male dancers' who just so happen to take their clothes off for money.  <br>  <br>  When you go to the mall, should your husband get to call a prostitute?|`|1899aea197e9521ce9a275c00c477c75aa	Cory a.... wow is it really like that at strip clubs that are for women?  I WANNA GO...... JAYJAY hon.... is there one near you???? WOW....I am calling the travel agent today and set up some reservations... Momma needs a vacation RIGHT NOW!!!!!!|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Not quite the same thing.  You should be able to have a girls night out, but his hunting trip is not the same thing as ogling other men.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Honestly? I would never let my wife go to one of those places. <br>  I don't know if you know, but they get very raunchy. Much more so than a female strip club where they just dance and strip.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	if he goes and rubs the dead dear that are laying all bloodied with his hands and groin then yes, yes you should be able to do that with male dancers.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	i would say yes if you agree to allow your husband to go to topless bars or receive lap dances instead of hunting trips!|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Would you care if he went to watch female dancers?|`|8PDzaAJcaa	totally different scenario.........grow up|`|vtYyCDrAaa	Hell yeah!  Grab some junk, girl!|`|uuMCGT9taa	why when he is away i would wait til he was around then go see the dnacers than go dance for ur man and get freaky !|`|TSmego9vaa	talk to your husband.(would you mind if your husband went to see some nude dancers) It works both ways
KySLpGZGaa	Hahaha what a story! lol I've seen your other questions.<br>  Have you thought of becoming a teen author, with an imagination like that you'd do really well. You should become one, you'll get paid loads!!!|`|gWT53mGJaa	You should basically keep your distance with those girls and you didnt really have to fight them wasnt that enough? Well good luck. :)|`|cDibyGGlaa	You didn't HAVE to fight them, did you? You won, didn't you? Wasn't that payback enough?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying it wasn't right. I would have gave them a slap or two, myself. But I wouldn't have gone as far as throwing those rocks. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would be worried only about the throwing the rocks thing. They pushed you first, right? You can always say that and what you were doing was just common self-defence. ;D

But to start dating now and fall for one particular guy well your still too young for that. I know this is not what you want to hear but think about it. This is a time in your life where you should be having fun.|`|h9fKoHGyaa	If he's really shy, you will probably never go out with him. Your relationship would get no where. Sorry, but it's the truth. I know this from experience. When a guy looks at you a lot, it could mean a lot of different things. He could think you're really cute, or you have something hideous on your face.|`|dsuXOaRraa	' .. and I did a little research on the internet, and it said that he might like me?! '<br>  <br>  The problem for me seems to be right there. Why would you research it? Stupid kids of today! You can't RESEARCH liking someone, it's a FEELING. And people say there are 'signs' for someone liking you, bull. Just ask him, stop making it so hard.|`|XukScWE3aa	You need to remove your email address form your question. this is not a good thing. This is normal it is part of growing up and you may look back at this and have a good laugh over this time.

zfskbQz4aa	Some guys are like that.<br>  <br>  It might be showing off or trying to impress you or someone else.<br>  Make sure he knows he doesn't have to prove that he's "cool" or something like that, to you or anybody else.|`|Vj2aKafbaa	yaeh, people are more talkative online and texting<br>  but, different when their together<br>  i have experiance trust me|`|Xdr5cJZUaa	a lot of guys are sweet when sending emails or texts or talking on the phone, but are jerks around other guys and their friends.<br>  dont take it personally. a lot of guys are like that.<br>  but if it really bothers you, talk to him about it or if he's really that much of a jerk, stop texting him.|`|4xg2KINcaa	one of my best guy friends does that to me too. ive started to distance myself from him because, honestly, i dont need that. Hes ALWAYS calling me stupid and then says hes kidding around. I dont know. Maybe he likes you or something and is teasing you. Or maybe hes just a dick. I honestly, dont know the answer to this one. Try asking him why hes such a dick to you. Tell him you dont like it at all and that he should stop. Also, ask him if hes serious or kidding. But really, i think you might be a little better off without him.|`|ZVfF7WqPaa	Unfortunately, having a dick often means being a dick in life - especially to females. <br>  In this case, he likely does like you but is so immature he has no idea how to show it. He is still in the 3rd grade mentality pulling the hair of the lil girl he likes. <br>  Confront him. Perhaps in a text where he is nicer. Tell him you do NOT like how he treats you when you are together. When someone treats you badly do not let it go on. Either walk away from that person, do not let that person ruin your happiness. OR confront them directly to settle the problem so you may become friends.
dw440Lylaa	First, find out if she's REALLY pregnant, or if this is a scam<br>  <br>  Second, she CHEATED on you, who's baby is it?<br>  <br>  Is she planning to keep it, abort, or give it up for adaption?<br>  <br>  Do the right thing in terms of the child, but that doesn't mean you have to continue a relationship with a hoebeast like her.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|TM09z7teaa	One: Make sure the kid is yours. <br>  Two: And if it is, tell her that you're only gonna be there<br>  for the kid, not her.|`|FZKFLTyLaa	Demand  a DNA test ASAP. Who knows if the baby is yours?|`|ded2181b98ab4c89b217681e47f520ecaa	well you say she cheated on you all the time, the baby might not be yours, i would say unless you really care for her, don't have anything to with her until you find out if you are the father or not, if you turn out to be the father then be their for your child, but i would just move on and find someone who cares for you enough not to do those things! :)|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I would wonder who's baby it is!  Be supportive but I would not take her back.  She could think you would be the daddy, so she has you believing you got her pregnant.  It is no longer the standard to be with someone who does not love you or someone you cannot trust.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	Who's the father? sounds like it could be "a million" others?<br>  I would let her rot in hell.<br>  <br>  do not consider a future with her. If I have learned anything it's once a deceiver, always one|`|KPYQwyeraa	if she cheated on you as much as you say then you should do nothing until the baby is born and you can get it tested to see if this child is even yours then you should go to court and get come custody of the child pay your support and help raise the baby if you feel that way about her and she told you she felt the way she does then you will never have a good healthy relationship she is a tramp and you sound like you deserve better than that good luck dont get back with her baby may not even be yours <br>  ~cat|`|M9Hh6MPpaa	You're right for not wanting anything to do with her, so find out if she is actually pregnant, then find out if its yours or someone else's baby.  Remember she cheated on you a lot so it might not even be your responsibility.  If its yours, get back with her for the baby, if not, then let her figure it out with her parents<br>  <br>  good luck man!|`|cd6cfd5514c5efed7558c38b4c118090aa	Oh god.<br>  Thats horrible.<br>  Make sure that you get a DNA test first. <br>  You don't HAVE to work things out, but if you 2 have a kid together, that would be the most mature thing to do.<br>  But if things don't go so well, then you still have the right to see your kid.<br>  You just need to make peace with the child's mom, come to realization that things just weren't made to be and make sure you are in your kids life.<br>  Thats all.|`|cUslVzhVaa	If she's keeping it,  you have no choice but to be connected to her your whole life.<br>  Unless of course its not yours...but if it is, <br>  This doesn't mean you have to go out.<br>  If you don't wanna work things out, then don't.<br>  But you know you have to spend time with her more <br>  than you would like too<br>  and this is a lot of baggage you'll have for future relationships.<br>  Do what she needs, pay for whats necessary...Move on. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|RlgGkQjqaa	wow!! is it yours for sure|??? even if it is could you trust her?? do you really love her??? sounds like she has got you under a barrel if you let it, girls like that want one thing...all their way!!!<br>  dont fool for it, she might not even be pregnant shes sounds immature and does not respect you good luck move on my friend we are all not like that|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Both of you can undergo DNA to see if the child is yours.  The after that don't have anything to do with her.|`|n2SDZz22aa	if i were you, i would say, "iwth all the cheating on me youve done, try and find the other dude that got you pregnent. **** off..."<br>  <br>  then just ignore her. :P|`|Uq6V3S4laa	wow thats hard<br>  but you said she cheated ...<br>  maybe is not ur child ? :S <br>  i dont know cause abortions are wrong|`|6dSonCRTaa	The right thing to do is be a father to your child,there are 2 many children in 2days society growing up without fathers.You just have to be the bigger person and put your negative feelings for her on the back burner,BUT before that can happen you have to be sure this is your baby.Like you said she cheated on you on more than one occasion so how can you trust her now.|`|ZBWVBdAGaa	im gonna sound  harsh, but its not your responsibility .you dont have to do anything , but i can understand if you still love her you can help her howerver way you want .still i would just leave her alone ,she could just be using you again. you did say that she cheated on you alot so that also a good reason tojust leave her alone. it could also depend if the baby is yours .sorry i dont haave a boyfriend and im not that experienced in those problems because most my friends dont have any.those are all my thoughts ^-^i hope i helped GOOD LUCK^_^|`|MLQS5Vkdaa	She could definitely be manipulating you, but there is really no way to know that.  Time will tell. For now, I would hear her out and weigh what she is telling you, then decide on what to do.  Good luck.|`|jjd9nJS7aa	find out if the baby is yours if not tell  her to p... off .if it is yours you will end up as a baby sitter while she is off out screwing around|`|GrbcICzMaa	tell her to leave you alone but give her some cash for the baby|`|KGylLWgIaa	Are you sure the babies yours? If she cheats that much!|`|9XBZTR6Zaa	move across state|`|A9sLvVDxaa	If the real father doesn't want the responsibility, she can take legal action, if she knows who he is. He can be compelled to pay child support.<br>  <br>  But it seems to me that she's scared and alone, so she's probably calling all of her old BF's to see who will rescue her. She does need friends right now and if you can forgive her, maybe you can be a friend.<br>  <br>  But becoming anything more than just a friend will mean you may get more responsibility than you bargained for in life. If you're not the real father of her child, then remember that. This is not your responsibility no matter how much guilt she may lay on you. Just remember that she's very scared and she needs healthy options. <br>  <br>  Being a friend could help her, but I wouldn't date her right now.
5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	First of all, is he single? If he is, then dun bother. <br>  <br>  If not, has he ever shown any signs that he might like you more than a friend? If yes, you are in luck. Just tell him how you feel and hopes that things would would out fine.<br>  <br>  If your ans is maybe/not sure to the q on whether he has feelings for you, then ask yourself if you are willing to risk the relationship with him just in case he doesnt like you. It might become awkward for you 2 in the future if he doesnt like you.

CJnZZIytaa	Hmmm, I think that maybe this was good for you two. Yes, I know it hurt a lot, but maybe it made him realize that he didn't want anyone else BUT you. <br>  <br>  You know what I mean? I think he tried to be with another girl to see how it was, and from the looks of it, he absolutely hated it...<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!<br>  Good luck.|`|ghISlqExaa	i feel sorry for you. so sorry. Love hurts more than anything on earth. Trust me. Do you truly love him?

However, every working relationship must be built on trust. If he tells you that he has no interest in a further relationship with this girl, you need to trust and believe him. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong in you telling him how you feel. If he is the considerate person that he should be, and cares about your feelings, he will respect you and understand why you feel this way.<br>  <br>  Do not prohibit him communicating with this girl or he will feel trapped. However, if you discuss the situation, he should be able to come to an agreement with you that he will minimize his communication with her.
X4i2jej5aa	I hate arrogant and cocky guys, my friend, (a guy) is so annoying, but somehow deep inside of him, I find someone who understands. Your friend would be a 2 for me, probably cause I like shy guys and the soft spoken ones. My friend also had a lot of girl crushes too. I wonder why..... But still, I think the main reason why all of the girls in your school is attracted to him is because since he is so full of himself, he's sure what he's doing. Girls love to put up a fight with guys and probably your friend is putting up some heat arguments. Don't try to change yourself for other ppl to like you. They will like you for you and if you do try to change yourself to accommodate other ppl, they will just think of you as a wannabe.|`|x7uYAPaSaa	I dont rate him that high. 3/4 out of 10|`|kAX9xBmkaa	5|`|JHhpoByyaa	I cant really see his face,<br>  but we live in the same area code :)<br>  haha.<br>  <br>  mine? <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjUIRtj6kdu4LzPA8YmlDHDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307105308AA4ChOI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|r3EKIQH8aa	i'm not gonna lie he really isn't attractive and having a cocky attitude doesn't help at all  but thats just my opnion
F0uLexezaa	i hate to say it but given the opportunity, he will do it again|`|wgYMHW9Naa	Did he seem sorry?  I hope he did... My boyfriend and I have been through this, both of us have done some screwed up things, but there's always the steepest climb before it gets easier.  Things like this test our will of how much we want to make it work, sometimes it does for people and other times, it doesn't work out at all. I think you did the right thing if YOU do, too.  Therefore who cares what other people think!
hD5WSYbpaa	You can NEVER tell if someone is really sorry. Men lie, But men tell the truth also. If you really love him, and believe that he is truly sorry and that he loves you, then you should forgive him. Forgive but do not forget. If it happens again, then he was not sorry and he will do it many times after.|`|71VRvldJaa	In my opinion, cheating is a deal breaker.....no second chances!  Cheating doesn't just happen.  It's a deliberate choice.  With choices come consequences and he knew when he cheated that the consequence could be losing you!  He chose to cheat anyway.  If the foundation of your relationship is built on great chemistry, it will NEVER last!.....and because he knows you forgive so easily, he WILL do it again!
Ga2dMpB7aa	Because you love him. You love spending time with him, so obviously you feel sad when you don't get to.
AcgDcQG0aa	She probably lost her interest in you for one reason or another.  And you probably would be better off trying to make friends with some other girl.|`|EdidZdtlaa	GIVE HER SOME SPACE FOR RIGHT NOW AND WAIT FOR HER TO TEXT YOU. IF SHE LIKES YOU SHE'LL COME AROUND.|`|2wsv8vz4aa	she thinks you're suuuuuuuuuuuuuuper annoying. if she actually told you that you text her too much, there's a problem. it's also super annoying when guys keep texting you without you replying.<br>  like <br>  "hi" "hey" "hello?" "you there?" "is my texting bothering you?" "helloooo?"|`|TLim2pBTaa	Maybe you should give her some space and not text her all the time.|`|1yWBRCKSaa	if i were i would leave it be and see wat happens, maybe she likes you but she is afraid that you might find out.|`|d5d3d49e305b06c6f5252e0d0508cd4baa	Sometimes people need some ME time.  Give her some ME time and see if she comes back after the break.  It not, move on.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	She probably just needs breathing room. She just got over a relationship and needs time to get her mind straight. Don't push it or you can lose her for good. Also think that if she does go for you it could be a rebound thing and then later on dump you cause she got back with her old flame. Do you want that? So give her time to make sure she is done with the dude.|`|HNAVlwV7aa	sometimes girls are just not in the mood. maybe the subject that u were talking (texting) about just didn't interest her.|`|UIvcrPQHaa	Just ignore her and you'll see how fast she'll text you but do not text her back, she'll be all over you. We hate to be ignored...................good luck!

You should always interpret something as them liking you. And you should always have the mindset that you like them.<br>  <br>  People who like somebody are liked by them. I can say a whole lot about this... Literally an entire guide (which I'm writing right now...)<br>  <br>  Anyways. YES. She DOES like You. Everyone does.<br>  <br>  I also noticed you don't capitalized your "i" 's. That actually has a psychological effect on you... Often it means that somebody has low self-esteem, and doesn't respect themselves enough to capitalize it.<br>  <br>  Ly - well... that could mean "Love You". So, I'm guessing that could be a sign she likes you.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Kris|`|mNH6ZtNTaa	There is Absolutely no way for me to know what exactly she's thinking. She might just like you as a really good friend. I say you should make a move and see how she reacts! Why not? And she might not have accidently put "ly" at the end of it.  But she might just love you as a friend. I think she likes you with what you've told me but im not sure completley of the situation. So just go ahead and take a chance!<br>  -Hope i Helped|`|AA11413347	Yep I think she does like u if shes txtng u all day and put ly and end of txt! :)|`|UGDMYh0Kaa	i think she does too<br>  <br>  good luck =]
Yr1nToGzaa	First of all look back to his past. Has any girl ever hurt him before? If so then he is maybe worried and doesn't want it to happen again. Maybe he does like you back and he's afraid or unsure of what to do. After all by what he's said to you it sure does sound like he likes you back. He might think 6 months isn't a long enough time. Let's face, guys aren't extremely bright and get confused VERY easily! :) Just give him some more him but don't stalk him or anything like that, always give a guy personal space, he's probably wondering what to do himself. Just wait and if nothing happens then move on. But good luck anyway! :D|`|82niQjyCaa	just carry on as normal, don't try to hard but don't let him forget you like him, oh and DON'T act like his girlfriend x|`|2I5XqMDzaa	get over him its not worth wasting ur time on something like that|`|P21RQ8xpaa	i just got over the same problem. i started at a new school and became friends with the school hottie!! we've been like best friends for almost a year and i always had to listen about the girl he likes. so while i waited for him to like me, i began getting over him and moving on. you should do the same thing. move on......it sucks but it helps|`|TnHKoM2naa	dont waste your time be his friend, but dont try to be anything more. Like try dating other people in time he may decide if he really likes you more than a friend than not. But just waiting around hoping h'ell like you is just a waste.|`|tugUQ7R6aa	Moooooooooooooooooooooooooove on<br>  <br>  maybe if he sees you with someone else ...
cl6r8cGBaa	dude, you dont want to be desperate, but you sound desperate. its been 8 months so just let go. my girlfriend and i broke up and its been more than 9 mos, its killing me, but i know that she doesnt care anymore, so why would i stay in contact with her.|`|ZihoDc9eaa	I am assuming its an ex-boyfriend, right? i say go ahead and break the ice...just tell him you wanted to say hi and hope everything is well...it worked for me, although its been three months for me. but anyhow, just ltext or e-mail him, and just leave it at that. He'll come around when its up to him, stay strong.|`|rtr64Pyyaa	I'm guessing this is somebody you had past history with. Since it's been 8 months (which is a very long time!) since you two have talked, why not send him a text or email saying "Hey! How are you? Haven't heard from you in a while." That doesn't sound desperate at all. It sounds like you care and genuinely want to know how he is doing =] <br>  Hope that helps you! <br>  Good luck =]|`|5CJ3rnlWaa	Why not just call him? Actually speaking to him might say more than sending a text or an email.
tU5NJVL3aa	If I weren't married?  Maybe.  Not enough details.|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	yeah|`|wqchA8B7aa	No, I'm sure you're nice, but my wife would kill me. Can you keep a secret?|`|oAPSJnSEaa	I would go on a date with you see if anything clicked...but from this description I'm not sure if I would even go on a first date.|`|w7vgsK89aa	You're just asking to be raped. This isn't an internet dating service, you know.|`|XqS5DxR9aa	Only if I could get a note from my wife.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Well, I'm a girl, but from a guy's perspective... I'm sure a lot of guys would like to go out with you! I have brown hair and brown eyes too, and I've always been told that I'm funny and sweet (not loud, though).|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	I get accused of being loud so I try to pipe down just a little. Just because when I here others being loud some times its very annoying.<br>  Its really not that hard, just need reminded sometimes. lol|`|mxFZnj0uaa	You have brown hair and brown eyes.. You and everybody else!|`|0lwGsRNqaa	Well you hardly included any details. I'd have to see a pic to be able to decide, but i'd go with yes depending on your age.|`|EtXktTgbaa	better description..... but mabz.|`|XeLZtw20aa	possibly|`|zZtAYBowaa	no sweet heart i prefer introverts!!!! different people have different likes ;) !!!!!!!!!|`|7Sslop1Baa	Hell yeah!!!|`|8idurg0Daa	1.

eGpOIV12aa	sounds like she has a man and her friends know it. if she let on to her friends that you two knew each other more than in passing, then her friends might say something to the guy she is seeing or wants to see
oY1YzPMzaa	I have been the guy in this story. My friends always tell girls Im a player. Its not true but u cant just make people change their minds cuz u know they're wrong when they dont think so. I say give it a shot but the first chance that it even looks like he might be that way, ditch him!|`|NOMpvcC8aa	ok i've been in a situation like this also. I remeber I was dating this guy and I thought he was the greatest thing in the world. When I had told my friends about him, they all said DO NOT DATE HIM because he just uses girls and only want to get some. Of cousre I thought they were completely wrong, well a few weeks later, I saw how he truly was and I had kicked myself for not listening to my friends. I think you may wanna stay away from this guy, because if your friends and his neighbors are all telling you the same thing, it's MOST LIKELY true.
gRXy66dOaa	ask him if he likes anal?
AA10250756	He thought you wouldn't like him unless you thought he was a big shot. Tell him you don't like the fact that he lied to you and that it would not have made a bit of difference about the way you felt about him, so there was no reason to lie and you do not want him to do this in the future.|`|pNqjsJn7aa	just talk to him about hw u wud appreciate if he is honest with u...tell him u really like him but wouldnt want to start a relationship with this confusion in mind...if he loves u enuff he will surely confess...but remember to b supportive so dat he doesnt lie in future..alll d best|`|y1uppUHcaa	Tell him straight up that you know all that stuff is a lie. It's just outlandish for him to know any celebrities really. But the point is, you need to tell him straight up you know it's all a lie. Give him a stern look and don't joke about it at all, be 100% dead serious. If he confesses to it and says why he did all of it, which my guess is just to get your attention and make you like him, then you could possibly start a relationship. If he keeps up with the lies and doesn't admit to them, then you shouldn't try a relationship with him at all. He seems to be used to lying and will most likely do it again, but if he's not willing to fess up to it and change, then tell him you're done. There is no reason to stick around with a guy if he's going to constantly lie. Granted, this lie doesn't seem so bad. People do crazy things for love and to get attention, and that's what it sounds like, but you don't want the lying to carry on.
gRXy66dOaa	good*
bsFcU9xwaa	slow down playa! jk haha but if you really like the senior girl u shuld stay with her. it all depends on your feelings. plus the senior will b gone next year...|`|0ktcvglRaa	Well, you already have a girlfriend, and you can't date two girls at once...<br>  <br>  Decide which one you like more. If you like the sophomore better, break up with your girlfriend.

Can you bring her around your friends and family? Is she funny? Does she have things in common with you? If not you should consider the other girl. <br>  If the sophmore is finding you everyday to hug you then she does like you, a lot. I used to do the same thing, give hugs to the boy I'll liked.|`|AIRxWgumaa	Well if your dateing someone, you shouldnt be worrying about other girls, but if you like the sophmore more than the senior, then let the senior go because then theres no point on holding the girl back, but if your stuck in between both of them, then find out if the sophmore likes you and go from there.|`|Nu8MJ8G8aa	They are both definitely attracted to you.  Since nobody on yahoo knows the girls the decision of who to choose is up to you.  I don't recommend going for both as gossip travels extremely quickly in high schools.|`|CX3QUgLtaa	well you have to decide who you really like first, if you like the sophomore  then you need to stop stringing along the senior. You might have more incommon with the sophomore cause she is closer to your age.|`|rqASGeevaa	It depends on what you want out of your relationship. Are you in it for the fun? Or are you looking for something genuinly meaningful? See what kind of pushes and pulls you get from either girl. Look at your options openly and do what's best for you. Good luck!|`|5LC70Op3aa	i agree with tone...go with a juniour or all of them...lol...but make sure to tell them first and not let them find out that u were with other people...that maybe bad...who knows u may be lucky and have a three some lmao...but juniour would be more likely story|`|db2037589e5edcba216407bf92558175aa	cheater!!!|`|kf5oUKpBaa	go 4 a junior.......|`|PzDpyQZnaa	C'mon Dude, you are dating a senior, and you're a freshman.  That sounds pretty legendary to me (unless she is fat or ugly).  I'll be honest with you here, it sounds like you like both of their personalities alot, perhaps you should be a bit shallow and go with the hotter one.  Or, you could perhaps wait for something to come between you and the senior (perhaps her going off to college), and then go for the other one.  <br>  P.S.  when the senior goes to college (if that's where she's going), i wouldn't wait for her, too many parties that she could be unfaithful at.|`|p1oSkjJPaa	whatever you do dont cheat on the girl ur with.. if you like the sophmore girl then u shud go out with her.. plus the senior girl is like leavin next year lol so like i think ur better off with the sophmore|`|sJIs9Xckaa	ur sucha a player|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	pick which 1 s the sexiest

Obviously not at your age; but, you know what i mean...<br>  <br>  Why are you going to say no to someone you like... you will only 'kick yourself' after :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, go for it.

NbiJcMIvaa	This guy is probably nothing more that a "flame thrower". He's making statements that heknows knows is going to draw a negative reaction, and he's making these remarks for reaction value. He's a sh!t disturber, and probably enjoys it.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	He sounds seriously annoying. Ignore him, because he loves attention.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Wow, that guy as well as the teacher sound like assholes.

MDE4CLz8aa	Maybe you should just calm down with the whole situation... Maybe you should just tell this girl to stop bugging him because he's yours. If this is going to keep going. Call the police or something.|`|c0e153120e16cf5881dd153a30d4ac3baa	Before you intervene make sure that he already told her NOT to call. <br>  <br>  Then next time she gives him a call, talk to her and ask her not to call him again.|`|XU1fftrMaa	If it was me..

You just have to wait for him to text him back. I have a guy friend who I text and he doesn't reply back because he probably doesn't have his phone or he just doesn't feel like talking.|`|Yr1nToGzaa	it means that you're being a bit pushy. guys hate it when girls constantly text them. they're not too bright so chill and wait for him to text for once or chat on MSN or something else instead.|`|TLim2pBTaa	Maybe you should stop texting him for a while and see if he initiates a text first.|`|71VRvldJaa	It sounds to me very one sided.  I don't think he's interested!|`|0ktcvglRaa	Some people just don't like to respond back to text messages right away. Sometimes I take a day or two to reply to a text message, depending on the urgency.
JEID5rCoaa	ASK HIM OUT!!
FSruw622aa	Well the feeling of rejection is always there.  80% of women feel that a man has to make the first move in a relationship... at least I think that's the number I heard.  <br>  <br>  If you still feel that he should ask you out.  Have a chat with him and make it known that you would be willing to date him.  You can't just hint at it because guys understand obvious things a little better then a hint which usually confuses the crap out of us.
MW6WOTDIaa	look... this girl is telling the truth. as long as she loves you. dont LIE about it unless you REALLY want to push her away, which i dont think you do. just relax. she'll come to her senses sooner or later|`|K9BT12kpaa	i think its space but sounds like you messed up big time
Uqc0xly5aa	Well before you say that you love this person, you should really get to know them. It takes a long time to really get to know someone. Take it slow, don't rush things. Talk to your boy friend about the situation. If he doesnt want to talk that much to you just give him his space. Don't smother him. Be yourself, don't tell him things that aren't true just to get him to like you more. Im sure everything will be fine, remember ya'll have only been dating for a month. Relationships take time. Oh and make sure you go on dates, don't just sit at each others house, you don't really getto know each other if thats all you do. Good luck and stay positive.<br>  <br>  I'm a guy by the way.
gO9tl2uhaa	If you're dating, no shame.<br>  <br>  If you hang around her just for the sex, yeah, there's a shame. You used her to have sex.<br>  <br>  But yeah, if you care about her ( casual sex isn't caring, dating is caring) it's no big deal|`|pNqjsJn7aa	nopes|`|0lwGsRNqaa	As long as you like here there is no shame.|`|7dAgxi43aa	If you think there is then there is. <br>  <br>  <br>  if she likes you and you like her, thats what counts as well.|`|SxaSQFZGaa	Just don't get caught ;D<br>  Have fun :]]|`|AA12117694	yes
MDE4CLz8aa	I think you should totally get him a gift. It would not be weird. I mean its just a simple gift. Candy is a great gift|`|bsFcU9xwaa	yea a candy bar wuld be sweet. it wuld say i listen to u but ur not desperate.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|WPhADGwEaa	that would be werid|`|m6H5x02Kaa	no...if his birthday was a while ago dont get him anything it will seem very awkward. if you want to get him something get him something relevant to his interests like music or something like that-nothing that expensive but a candy bar is strange so dont get him that|`|8idurg0Daa	Why don't you get him a normal Happy Birthday card? Its like the simplest thing to give. What you write inside to make him feel good around you is in your mind.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	Sure. Get him something goofy though. Nothing romantic or anything.|`|K3a2fcq8aa	yahhh get him  a candy bar or somehting...cuz he wud know that you care! and he will most likely start liking u..and ifhe already does then he will more!
pVnUhYLQaa	Have sex, either inside or outside in the rain.|`|fkchpcHJaa	sexy time
Wv592rOqaa	Best you try to get over his past.  However, after dating him for only 6 months it is way too early to determine where your relationship will go. Just take your time and do not allow yourself to be rushed into making any major decisions - the age difference is not significant as long as you are both of legal age and consenting adults.  <br>  <br>  His past was his life granted you might not find it attractive.  When a person is ready to settle down they usually do so by discussing it like he has with you and most people like this remain faithful when they are ready for a serious relationship because they have nothing to hide or be curious about.  You are smart and requesting that he be tested was absolutely wise - and his results coming back clean - mean he took the right precaution while in these many relationships and if he has no children from these relationships - he is intelligent and smart w/ respect to caring about himself.  Only question I would have - is he a sex addict or was he really just that wild during his youth? <br>  <br>  If he has a great personality then people from his past coming back to say "hello" should not be a threat to you.  <br>  <br>  Being young and not having experience makes us all feel insecure, but you will have to learn to build your own confidence after he has more to lose than you have because apparently out of all these people in his past you wants to be with you!  And, that says a lot about what he thinks of you and needs from you.  He cannot make you feel secure, you have to do this on your own.  <br>  <br>  This man is not hiding anything because he has interigty and he wants to be honest and perhaps you are the one and past friends will soon learn to respect that.  If you cannot forget his past, you should not remain in the relationship - it will only make both of you crazy and miserable.   I hope you make the right choice - good luck!|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Forget his past or forget him. His past is not now and it will destroy you two. So if you can't forget it then forget him. Jealousy is a sickness don't let it over come you. Be glad he sowed his oats before you started seeing him. Good Luck!|`|XeLZtw20aa	this may not be what you want to do but you should calmly talk to him about it and you two can talk it out|`|19JkC34Xaa	I've had the same problem. My boyfriend of 1 year and a half has a fairly long list of people he's had sex with...half as long as your guy, but my boyfriend's 21 so... =P Anyway, you have to stop thinking about the other girls. Did he tell his family he was going to marry them? Did he live with all of them? Did he take them all to do amazing, romantic things? No, they ****** like bunnies, it sounds like. =P He's with you right now. If he wanted one of the other girls, he'd be with them. =] Good luck!|`|UG2z5rGIaa	if hes so good to you<br>  <br>  and he wants to marry you<br>  and treatign you really special<br>  <br>  then wth are you worrying for<br>  <br>  he obviously doesnt think your just another "woman"<br>  <br>  jeez woman <br>  <br>  calm the eff down<br>  or your gonna loose him then you'll be the one crying on the couch with your ben and jerry's going WHY DID I DO THT!?!|`|1oPwKe0Jaa	You aren't one of his friends, so you really shouldn't have heard about this to begin with.  Just drop it and focus on you guys, because if you don't you will ruin your relationship with the man that treats you like a queen.  There are reasons that his exes are exes.  So yes, they were intimate, just as you were.  If you really think about it, don't you think your relationships were a lot more meaningful than what his were?  He had numerous flings but you had two serious relationships.  He probably has his own insecurities.  Why isn't he overreacting thinking, well she's had all this before?  I hope you understand what I'm saying and realize that he is happy with you.  He wants to spend the rest of his life with you.  So why are you even attempting to compare yourself to people who aren't as special in his eyes as you are?|`|6wA5mF9zaa	You never mentioned if he's ever cheated or not... if he has, then you should worry, because depending on the type of guy he is, the second he gets frustrated with you and his patience runs out, he'll go straight to another girl.<br>  <br>  BUT, if he DOESN'T have a history of cheating, and everything is going will in the bed department, then there's absolutely no reason to worry and you just have to let time take it's course and let trust build. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just give it time.|`|d7cc43a4cae03650249731c48487684eaa	well you sound kinda young to be getting serious. but think if you were another one of those women he'd probably not be with you. but don't let yourself get too involved. he could easily break your heart. <br>  <br>  i would continue doing what you're doing and just ignore his past. it's behind both of you now.|`|wqchA8B7aa	You need to get over it. This is your own insecurity talking, nothing else. I have no magic bullet except to say "Let go". What you two did before sexually is not the business of the other person, as long as you both are clean.
0ktcvglRaa	Yeah, my best friend who works at Hallmark does that all the time.|`|2RAvyY0naa	Only when I sit down. Have to give my footseys air to and wiggle my toes at some point. <br>  <br>  Heels suck.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Sounds sexy|`|42tNVOUDaa	I do at school...|`|s2X1Wcliaa	What kinda question is that?|`|df803ac845624e37559acc061d7d047aaa	Yes my friend katia hates shoes! She does not like to wear them @ all. We were born without shoes so its only natural.

But, when i was at School i sometimes did; whilst working and that... Why?<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|AHHAGxlCaa	I am barefoot all the time at home<br>  <br>  not at work the kids trample your feet x|`|mmMgfhf2aa	I walk around my office barefoot all the time. Never in tights though! They're horrible sweaty things!|`|v398Qalyaa	no, simple because there are many concrete floors and steps there, plus i need to go outside frequently to another building, also there are hundreds of teenagers with big stomping shoes...
HnCUC1YIaa	GOSSIP!!!  girls love to gossip!! i wish my boyfriend would have talked crap about people with me. but you cant tell anyone what youy girlfriend tells you!!!!!|`|QAc9LoVzaa	Ask her things like:<br>  <br>  Whats on your mind right now?<br>  <br>  Or.<br>  <br>  If you could be anywhere in the world right now, where would you be?|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	It's always awkward at the start.. part of a new relationship.  If you're running out of things to say.. well that's impossible!  And now every moment needs to be filled with talking, sometimes silence is just as comfortable. :)|`|RdMpPhhPaa	if u start goin out with her more... ull always have stuff to talk about... because u cn always coment on the stuff u did... or remind her abt those funny things :)|`|UG2z5rGIaa	y r u going out with a girl u cant talk too<br>  <br>  wth<br>  <br>  but anyways<br>  <br>  ask her about herself<br>  <br>  girls talk talk talk|`|kAX9xBmkaa	ask her things you never asked her and youll get to know her better.|`|nHz1b2chaa	Well...if you don't know what to talk about anymore..then I am guessing that its not going to work out..I am a girl obviously..and my last boyfriend we never talked and we never had anything to talk about..we ended up being really good friends, nothing more. But if you think it will last, then I'd say go for it I guess?|`|SEyRe6Eaaa	Make sure you know all the basics... fav color, music, subject, book, etc. Than you can talk to her about random stuff (like what she wants to be when shes older, her biggest fear, etc) I mean sometimes you can just ask her to tell you a story about something that's happened in her life...|`|y6Tj678Raa	if you already told to her a lot and she has not response anything so you try to say another story or you should try to ask her friend about her favorites. I think you will know what kind of story you saying after you did it. Good luck|`|EdsSZvvoaa	every day something new happen in your life :)<br>  talking about your day ,family , friends  etc sounds good or just instead talking about you talk about her. maybe you'll be surprise to discover  new things of her.|`|7MoTvFidaa	hello anything lol shoes, shopping take her to a museum or mini golf have fun times so you have some fun stuff to talk about|`|d3acaf600457d438c3379562a5eb82baaa	you probably shouldn't be together.|`|U8sTUqY4aa	tell her you want to have sex
Qe95LNxYaa	he is one desperate guy|`|2aE0BxfFaa	She thinks that he has everything together and etc. He thinks he can dominate her and etc. If I'm 30 thats what I'm thinking. Theres no way he respects her like a grown woman.|`|AA11999454	Well, I'm not 19. I'm 20.<br>  But I can say that I surely would, and I did. Well, I was 18 and he was 28. <br>  Grown up men attract women a lot. They're settled in life, have stable salary, don't live with their parents, and I very independent. Also they're experienced in bed, they know how to please a woman, how to attract her, and they're good enough to look up to. I know some of these relationships that grew into marriages. So I don't see anything wrong here. <br>  And 30 year olds are way better than 19 year old boys that are only thinking of getting laid and trying to look cool in front of their friends, and thinking only about themselves. That's why girls choose adults.|`|RiGSq1r6aa	No, I would not do it.<br>  The age gap is too big. 30 year old man know already so much of life and I like more to "learn" about life with someone my own age.<br>  I hope you understand, my English is bad. ;)<br>  30 year old man can be great as a friend, I have loads of them. I learn much of them, but I would not like to date them because I would feel like a baby and we would not have things of the same age group together. (10 years is a long time, the world did change much in that time)<br>  <br>  Just because he is more mature I would not date a 30 year old. I like to grow up with my partner. Learn together, not to learn from him like he is a dad or teacher.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	she is just in it for the stuff he buys her. She is probably attracted to him b/c he is financial stable and he is just looking at her as a young piece of ***. Sorry. good thing is, it won't last.|`|QlvcSgn0aa	Why wouldnt they? hes 30 and probably has his stuff together. Makes more money and is more mature.
dH00ipHnaa	I would tell her that you've had bad experiences dating people that you work with and that you learned not to do that again. Mention that she is a great girl and you would love to be friends. It would also help if you would follow up a couple days later and asked her if she wanted to get some lunch with you one day, if you are serious about being friends.  <br>  <br>  ...don't mention that you don't date white girls. I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to hear that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't bring a girl to the party. You're already turning her down and she doesn't want that slap in the face.  If you are worried about not knowing anyone at the party, you can certainly bring a guy friend of yours as long as you okay it with her.  Mentioning that you are excited for the Birthday Party would also be a nice touch.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|71VRvldJaa	I would probably decline and not go at all.....but IF you do go, you should take a date with you!<br>  <br>  You're very wise not to date girls from work.....regardless of what colour they are!|`|42tNVOUDaa	Dont invite the other girl. Sometime after or before the party tell her that you dont date people you work with.|`|HYUkWYrNaa	just be honest with her and don't bring another girl because if she likes you and has invited you to the party then that's just harsh.|`|QlvcSgn0aa	just bring the other girl. Whats it matter if you hurt her feelings? its not like you care about her enough to where it would matter.|`|bwgkbra5aa	From a Girl's point of view;;<br>  <br>  <br>  If you bring The Other Girl, and I was the Girl You Work With;;<br>  I would definitely be hurt.<br>  Who Wouldn't? <br>  But I'd get over it, because after you introduced me to your friend, and you spend the majority of my birthday chatting with her, If I have any common sense I'd realize you're more into her than me.<br>  But. That doesn't diminish the fact that our friendship would be scarred.<br>  <br>  However,<br>  <br>  If you didn't bring The Other Girl;;<br>  I would be really ecstatic if you showed up at my birthday.<br>  You'd be alone so if I'm really into you the way you think, I would probably corner you and try to socialize/flirt with you as much as possible.<br>  You'd be alone and defenseless who's gonna stop me? =)<br>  <br>  <br>  I guess the point I'm trying to make is if you bring the Other Girl, even if your friend from work doesn't get the idea that you're not interested, you can use the Other Girl as a reason to not chat with your Work Friend as much.<br>  You can also use the Other Girl as an excuse for why you need to leave the Birthday Early. =)<br>  <br>  <br>  But regardless, use your Best Judgment.|`|rMJAu6Wbaa	U can tell her ur not attracted to her or really the BEST thing is to tell her u don’t date people u work with cuz of ur experience. That should do it. It will be much better if u tell her before the party clear things up, so she won’t get the wrong idea both. And if u tell her on the day of her party it might ruin her b-day. <br>   <br>   Telling her u don’t like her or u wont go out with her is gona hurt her feelings but she will get over it; but bringing  another girl to her birthday  party is JUST WONG. . . in more ways than 1. It will make things VERY awkward between the two of u. So please don’t do it.
Zuc3cp5Saa	Try asking him out again. Although he broke up with you, he might miss you too, but you just don't know it. He probably just doesn't want to make the first move.
EdBvqVuLaa	just be yourself. HE might be a sports person, but that doesn't mean that you need to necessarily change. Just talk to him, you never know what might happen :) And he's probably is into other things besides sports. And being loud may get you into trouble in class, which you probably don't want to happen, right? Well, in my opinion, give it a shot and ask him to the dance. <br>  <br>  Also, talking to somebody is something that you can't really prepare for, so just be urself and ask him something like, "hey *insert name*, what's up? Umm, can I ask you a question?" He says something like, "sure" and then you say, "well, I was just wondering if you wanted to go to the upcoming dance with me, of course, if you don't already have a date though." And he will say something like yes or no. But even if he does say no, just try cause if you don't, then you will miss out on something.|`|pocUt5J2aa	DO NOT CHANGE YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  i repeat<br>  DO NOT CHANGE YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  Worst. Idea. Ever.<br>  <br>  if you change yourself, will he really like the real you? besides, im sure he's into other things other than sports. what about music? movies? there's got to be something you have in common. just try talking to him. <br>  <br>  good luck :)
c0102fddfeaef7a79d662d939f998e68aa	If anything, the girl being friends with your other friend could work out to your advantage.

This could have been a sticky situation, except this friend of mine was a very cool person and talked it over with me and basically said "she likes you and not me, so go for it" and did not blame me for it at all. So maybe you should see how your friend feels about it, and see how she feels about the both of you, and it will work out the way its supposed to. Try not to screw your friend over as well, that's just dirty.|`|HYUkWYrNaa	if they are friends then you have an advantage. you know she will talk to your friend about things. ask your friend to find out if she likes you.. or if she is interested in anyone else at the minute. your friend can put in a good word for you.|`|54296hcbaa	hit on her and see where it goes<br>  <br>  be nice, POLITE, and funny and complimentary<br>  <br>  GO FOR IT|`|Ps7Fl8ztaa	My openion to leave her -out to him ....WhAtEvEr ..Girls or Friendships DuHHHH !!|`|9x8ryDv6aa	ask her out. simple as that.|`|5vjv7e24aa	if he's not making a move or thier clearly not going out, then u make the move on her. pretty easy.
inxKRubVaa	Either you could find a way to avoid her, which apparently isn't an option, or find somebody else. Although I normally hate rebounds, either you sit there and hope you'll get over her until she finally goes away, or you find somebody else to make it go away. I know what it's like, I had the same problem with a guy and feelings didn't start going away until I stopped hanging around with him and my friends (I switched schools, not for him for something else). Pick one of the two, or the feelings will just get worse.|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	The same thing happened to me. Well, sort of. I thought my life was ending, but I'm okay now. Just don't really talk to her for the sake of it. Ignore her as much as possible, but don't be rude. Time will heal it. The rule of thumb is that it takes as long to get over someone as you were dating them.

I would have sex before marriage. I once believed that until i had sex and was engaged.|`|HYUkWYrNaa	maybe the reason girls wont go out with you is because they might think that you being a christian means that you are inexperienced or that you will get too serious because you cannot have sex before marriage, hang out with other christians, meet girls who are in the same situation as you?|`|OhKl0BAVaa	your too nice.  next time you think you meet a girl worth it. treat her different then you treat all other girls. your permanently in the friend zone it seems. you gotta hop out quick and grab the one you want before she can put you there. but your better off without the trouble haha.

Just be patient, even though I know that can be hard ;)|`|dsuXOaRraa	He might be shy.<br>  <br>  Ask him yourself if you're so sure, it's not that hard. Rejection isn't the worst thing out there.|`|a1nMklAdaa	It sounds like he definetely likes you but maybe he is shy. Just ask him if he'd like to hang out some time. It doesnt have to be a date. Just something casual. If you have something planned with your friends, ask if he wants to come along. That way you can hang out with him without the pressure of it being a date and see how you like him. After that initial hang out, im sure he will take the initiative and ask you out one on one sometime. Maybe he isnt sure if you like him and thats why he hasnt mustered up the courage. Just be casual about it and act like it's not a big deal and you'll see. :-)|`|nVEBL4ukaa	Maybe you should ask him. I waited for my now husband to ask me out and we waited around forever. Until a friend of mine asked him in my place. We have now been together 9 years.

Because if either one of them gets me pregnant, I'll have a baby, and I don't need twins, unless they pop out of me. Atlleast babies cant' care for themselves, so they settle for what they get, as long as they're pacified, its good for them. But spousal babies are worse, because  they're never satisfied! And they always look to see what other wives are doing for their hubbies w/o looking at themselves.

3ag4Fu5Naa	Guys are just..! Its like genetic for them. They can't commit to relationships. Most of them are alright on their own but they feel that they need to impress their friends. It's like they cant help it. They all feel like they need to cheat and can never see when theyve got a good thing. Dont worry, im sure you'll find someone who will treat you right eventually Life just wants you to go through a few bad relationsnips first, that way you'll know when its right :) just hold in there like the rest of us :)|`|rsAqrbsgaa	You must be really pretty

However, do not push the issue of his feelings - if he really cannot see you as his gf - it just won't work no matter what you do.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	ya it hurts lots when someone says they see you more like a sibling than anything else. and people usually state that cuz they want to keep a CLEAR friendship boundary only, nothing more. cuz if he sees you like a sis, i doubt he will ever picture making out with his sister. but there may be hope for you, IT ALWAYS happens when someone says they like antoehr person, the other person gets SOO turned off and makes it clearly just friends, then once rejected the person just backs off, then over time the person tha rejected the other realizes they have feelings for them (wow confusin analogy sry) but ya you never know. just keep bein friends with him, just dont get so emotionally attached, it ruins you. move on, and maybe when ur older he will come ot his senses ;)|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	Well you need to put yourself out there more flirt say things to make his mind blow the sister act will soon change hopefully!|`|x7QSU69Gaa	go up to him one day wen its just u two alone and tell him how much u feel about him and that u dnt wanna be just his "sister"|`|X5Fq3mOraa	If you really want him, tell him how you feel.<br>  If that doesn't work, i don't know what will.|`|vkDKUCOZaa	Nah  he was letting u down gently!!!!!!!!

He might like you back but is too scared to do anything about it. There is something that maybe you don't know, but, guys are stupid and they don't take hints well. You could always try dating another guy and see if the guy you love looks jealous, but i wouldn't want to recommend that, because it could always back fire on you. I would suggest, and i know this will be hard, but i think it would be best if you told him that you really like him and would like to go on a date, but if he's not interested in you that way, then its best to just move on with your life. I wish i could better help you, if i knew you personally than i could help you more, but since i don't know you or this boy, than it just makes it more difficult to understand the situation and how he acts around you. I hope this helps a little.
ciPiHVTbaa	don't hold your breath...women are weird.|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	You don't take rejection well do you ?<br>  Strange she gave you her correct phone number in the first place though if she was not even interested.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	I'd say he's most likely bisexual than gay and you finding emails like that doesn't mean he's fooled around with men. And just because he is that doesn't mean he can't love God just as much as a straight guy. Get an STD test done if your worried about it.

xoXkHOVsaa	The best thing you can do is ignore him and the rumors.  People will forget about you eventually.  If no one likes him, I doubt that they will really believe him.  This will all blow over, be patient.
Uj5kuzoJaa	Sad to say but you might have lost your friend. You need to sit him down and let him know what you're feeling. Let him know that you still want to be friends, but you don't have the same feelings that he has. Don't tell him that you like someone else right then. It's really none of his business and it will only hurt his feelings. See how the conversation goes and tell him that you still want to be friends. He might not want to be because he has stronger feelings for you, but all you can do is try. Good luck|`|gRXy66dOaa	WOW, you are really in the spot<br>  Just confront him and tell him that you like him as a friend and that you have already someone in mind<br>  I know he will prob not understand but keep on telling him that
BKr3y30maa	Some guys just have a difficult time opening up.  Some of them think that it's not "manly" to show emotion.  If you are having this problem with a boy, talk to him.  Tell him how you feel about him or whatever the issue is and ask him how he feels.|`|rvRimbVYaa	sometimes this is a method for men (few) to become stronger in feelings and sentiments and maybe he is not ready. Just make the move you and see what happens
r8VvBxM6aa	Be comfortable and be yourself. Smile a lot. Try to find common subjects to talk about. Don't seem too desperate or too distant. Find a middle ground.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one on flirting that might help you out. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ThatBrownGirl890" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/ThatBrownGir...</a>
briRpzL1aa	Easy... It is called "Push-Pull".  Basically you flirt allot with him and be nice, but then later back off.  Every time you go thru this cycle (if done right) it will leave him wanting to chase you.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and I Hope this Helps..|`|F8wzcKntaa	Just hold a general conversation with him about things you have in common and when he say something funny gently touch him. He should get the picture. If he doesn't then just let him know you like him and if you could grab a bite to eat. But don't move to fast you are only 14 and you still have your whole life ahead of you. Sex should be the last thing on your mind!|`|d64OgIXFaa	Pay a lot of attention to him one day, then casually ignore him the next (not intentionally ignoring him, if he says hi, then say hi back).

XmY8AJyjaa	First of all, i have to say that u r damn lucky to know a guy who treats u and adores u that way for such a long time,  provided that his intentions toward u r good and well-meaning  and provided he is not doing all this just to try to get u to have sex with him!! There are some guys like that. However  I never had a guy this hardworking in that manner!<br>  <br>  I mean u mentioned that he had been trying to get to know u for 4 years –that’s a very long time and he is still doing it! You also said that he sends u text many times saying that he likes u and that he thinks u r attractive. And he texts u to say hello if both of u haven’t spoken for a long time. And both of u flirt sometimes! Woooww!<br>  <br>  I think this guy really values ur friendship since he contacts u after a long time of non-communication. All the things he does would make absolutely anyone and everyone think that he definitely wants to hang out with u more often and hints at a possible gf/bf relationship with u. I mean he is rather persistent and consistent !!  He really does put in a lot of effort to know u better and make the first move in flirting or chatting!<br>   <br>  And yet after all the things he does, he doesn’t talk to u much in person and he only tells u that u r attractive thru texting. This is like sending mixed signals. And i am wondering about this too. Maybe his flirtations are just for fun? for thrills? But he continues to maintain contact and chat with u because he wants to be close good long-term friends with you?<br>  <br>  Maybe, like what u said, it is the fact that you hardly initiate conversations or flirtations or jokes or teasing with him and that makes him think u don't like him or that u are not too interested in him as a potential bf but only as a friend. It could have made him think that he doesn’t mean that much in a romantic or significant way to you.  One reason he talks to other girls a lot in person might be he wants to look "cool" and thinks it’s a total score to talk a lot with many girls. In fact i have a friend who had the same problem so she told her boyfriend how it hurt her when he left to talk to other girls and stuff. Her bf understood and stopped doing too much of it.<br>  <br>  I know u want him to talk and hang out with u more in person than thru texts. And u r considering maybe getting into a gf/bf relationship with him. So the thing to do is do things that show him that u want to become closer friends with him and that u r clearly interested in him as a boyfriend. What i think u should do  immediately is start initiating. Because the more unresponsive u r, the more he gets the wrong idea and the more he gets tired of chasing u. It takes 2 ppl for a relaionship to work, not just one. A one-sided relationship usually ends. Don't push him away. Don't push ur friends away.<br>  <br>  You should go up to him more often in person and initiate conversations /flirtations/jokes/teasing/nickname or petname calling. Other than chatting and texting, i do strongly recommend that u try to invite him to hang out with u and friends (that u and he know) more often or hang out more often with u alone. There are many things to do with him. You could go to the beach (good place), restaurants, indoor/outdoor cinema. Sports club to swim or play sports, minigolf/golf course, parks for strolls, funfair amusement park carnival, roller or ice skating, museums exhibitions galleries, clubs/concerts, paintball camping hiking Disneyland, vacations in the country and overseas? etc. <br>   <br>  Everyone knows for a fact that doing things with a person other than talking and flirting will mean sharing different new experiences with another person. Hence this is how a bond becomes stronger and how a relationship gets closer. This is the very reason why couples go on dates to movies, theme parks etc....in order to get to know a person and have fun at the same time. Fun strengthens any relationship.<br>  <br>  Also, the next time that he texts that he likes u and u are attractive, u could text sth flirty that gets the message across like “ You know you have said this SO many times as if u u mean it... but it is amazing u have never told me this in person...u know a girl likes to hear it face to face.....*wink* ^^ ”  In this way he gets the message. Or if u r texting about a topic, you could text back saying “we could talk more about it when we meet up/see each other at school/work...looking forward to it ^^ ~ You could even be more flirtatious and use more flirtatious joking-teasing phrases when u text him or when seeing him in person. But i do strongly recommend going out and doing activities with him as i don’t think u do enough of that with him. <br>  <br>  Another approach might be to tell him thru text/email/phonecall or in person that u like him and value his friendship and think that he is thoughtful fpr all the things he has done so far and ask what he thinks about being ur boyfriend.  <br>  <br>  You could even ask him directly in person (or via text or email if u r shy) why he only talks to you and tells you that u r attractive through texting and why doesn't he talk to you a lot in person like he does the other girls. In this way, he at least knows how you feel. <br>  <br>  Hope all this helps! Good luck dear.. Don't push him away. He sounds like a good catch.... :))|`|t3qUiPlWaa	No chances.<br>  <br>  Signs like these lead to communication problems in the future, which hurt more when you get actually attached.|`|Z0XR4F0vaa	Give him a chance, don't get too attached to him, see how he is and if he's sweet, trust him.|`|xheH9Mj0aa	What do you mean, "chances"?

I was 15 in 2000 and my then girlfriend was 17, we stayed together for almost six years. An extra year wouldn't have been a difference in how it was successful for so long.

nmQZIYutaa	You could lie but your not doing yourself a favor. You lost your virginity so you are not a virgin anymore. It does not make you a bad person if you do lose it. I just rather you save the title for the true virgins who have never had sex before. Call it a one time mistake but you are NOT a virgin so I wouldn't lie and neither should you. Plus it is none of your friends business what status you are if they ask say its none of their business because it is the truth,|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Its easy to tell if a gal is a virgin or not.. Have a look and u'll notice the difference|`|pNqjsJn7aa	no..u cant technically say dat u r a virgin as u have already had sex once....it does hurts initially is wat i have heard..but is pleasurable laters....why do u wanna lie newayz??|`|lPDRQH7aaa	No you can't say you are virgin...because your are not it does not matter that you don't want to have sex again. You already did so you are not a virgin no matter what.
Nrb9u9W0aa	maybe at first he was just being nice trying to talk to you b/c he doesn't know you yet. Maybe during your conversation you say something uncool or piss him off, or maybe he observed how others think you are uncool, so he doesn't want to talk to you anymore. After you saw him in the library, he was stare at you because he needs anyone to talk to maybe. But he cannot tell his friends b/c he wants to save his face. And he regretted for ignoring you... thinking that you were such a trust worth and nice person, but still uncool???? I just guess, maybe you are too cool or smart for him during your conversation, he ignored you b/c he feel low self-confidence. or maybe he was staring at you giving you the signal that "i broke up with my girlfriend now, let's go on a date. after all, i broke up with my hot girlfriend b/c of you."|`|Jhr68T0baa	Or He's Gay|`|8D7T43bKaa	He wants ur nuts stud.|`|zHtc3RuMaa	Okay...what ever dude! <br>  Don't even pay no attention to him and DON"T BE an A$$ kisser!.

N5q1osbCaa	You should never worry over someone that wouldn't worry over you back.<br>  <br>  I'd move on, you deserve better then that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|dZGL4NU8aa	How do you actually know that she doesn't feel the same way? Did she actually told you so or is it the way she acts towards you?<br>  <br>  You know, I have two friends... one is a guy and the other a girl. They both really like each other. The girl is the type who hides her feelings deep inside of her and doesn't let anyone know about it, expect for her closes friends. The girl, he likes her a lot too, but he doesn't think she likes him back. So being the type of guy that he is, he choses to be indifferent towards her and never really talk to her. He talks to all of her friends including me, but even though he does say a few words to her sometimes, they never really actually communicated. And this makes her hurt, and this makes him hurt. <br>  <br>  Well... by senior year, he decided that he couldn't take it any longer and confessed, but that's a different issue.<br>  <br>  The main point here is that don't assume that she doesn't like you and stop talking to her.<br>  <br>  If you can, just be a normal friend to her and have a normal decent conversation. if she really don't like you at all, then yeah don't talk to her (and don't even have her in your life anymore) because it would be annoying if someone you hate keeps on trying to talk to you, but I don't think she hates you (I'm just assuming that she doesn't hate you, correct me if I'm wrong). Otherwise, don't completely ignore her. That would hurt you to be so cruel and hurt her feelings to feel insignificant (even if she doesn't feel the same way about you).<br>  <br>  Also, by time, your feelings for her will fade if you treat the whole scenerio as a normal situation with a normal friend. The more you avoid it means the more you think about it, care about it, and it just makes it harder for you to let it go.|`|N0ZLYx6baa	Man, I feel you. I am in the exact same situation, and I cannot talk to him but cannot stop loving him, no matter what I do. What do you want, to be with her, or to forget her?

It wouldn't be rude to never talk to her again as long as you explain things to her, and tell her how you're feeling. That's what I had to do with my ex. He kept calling, but I just couldn't pick up. After a few months, I didn't feel the same way about him anymore, and it got the point where it was okay for us to talk again. Now we talk all the time, and we're good friends. No more feelings involved. You'll get to that point, just give yourself time apart right now if you want to be friends in the future. Good luck:)|`|pjggSVKKaa	you have to ask yourself if you really love this person would it be right to just cut them out of your life completely even jsut staying friends would be better than never talking to her again and to make her think you hate her and let her wonder for the rest of her life what did she do wrong you at least owe her a conversation before you make this decision|`|1J1w1aJYaa	I had this friend not long ago, we both liked each other a lot, we were really close and all that. one day she told me her feelings had changed and i took it badly because i felt so strongly about her. <br>  we wanted to stay friends but silly me had a lot of difficulties talking to her because of how i felt.<br>  <br>  i went through a lot of what you sound like you're going through. i kept asking myself all these questions and i was in two minds about whether i should move on or not. when i did "move on" i kept coming back 'cause i thought i could change the way things were. <br>  at that time i was just happy with being friends but even that was a struggle. =\<br>  it was terrible.<br>  <br>  though not quite like your situation in the end no matter how much i wanted for things to remain i had to get out because of how much it hurt. <br>  <br>  looking back i have to admit that i'm glad its over even though i thought at the time she was all i would ever need.|`|VDSHt23Aaa	talk with her get over her or get her to like you<br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307143640AAjS7al">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>
50ca49acd54c91d903d473e093ea2d38aa	The best thing i can tell you is to take her friend's advice. Be a good friend to her, but don't over do it and drive her off. Second of all, your relationship won't turn out very well with her if you're constantly with other women, and she works in a strip club. Be very careful. Show some interest, but not too much, and if you want it to work, definitely don't flirt with other women when on a date with her.<br>  <br>  P.S. be wary of the best friend. Take note of all that she says, and don't believe all that she says.|`|FJexip6Yaa	honestly no girl knows wat she wants. but if a girl is showing this much concern then pursue. try going out alone and see if anything sparks =) and remember your the good guy!
I6dIkhbOaa	I think you should listen to her BF about her being confused, she knows her best. It sounds like she likes you and is attracted to you but one thing you need to be careful about is that this girl is "on the rebound" right now. It probably feels really good to her to have a nice guy paying attention to her and being sweet but at the same time, if she just broke-up and is still sometimes seeing this guy after the fact, then she is no where near done with him. I would say continue to be a friend to her and let her know you are interested but if you are smart, you will proceed with caution. If she wants to jump into something this soon, you are more likely to get your heart broken then for this to go anywhere. If she is worth it, keep waiting and don't pressure her. Hope this helps!|`|fqdIVD3Yaa	I think that she might like you, but she probably still has strong feelings still for her ex. Especially since they are talking about getting back together. This could be the time to step in and tell her really how you feel and hope she feels the same way... or wait until things blow over with her ex and keep things up the way they are now, then make your move.|`|WdzH8rI1aa	woah woah woah, never ever ever ever talk to a girls best friend about a girl!!!!! geez your dumb, the girl is gonna turn around and tell her|`|4cfX7AThaa	She likes you...but more as a friend right now.  If you want to see her romanticly....ask her out!|`|mmks8Dyuaa	wow man, you must have a thing for waitresses xD<br>  but i don't think so lol<br>  she doesn't like you<br>  sorry|`|3jhLIUKyaa	I personally would say yes she does|`|KJmuHxcCaa	Yes, she does ok here if u follow these steps she will be yours for sure.<br>  <br>  1- Tell her how u feel<br>  <br>  2- Tell her that u will take care of her<br>   <br>  3- Tell her you will love her more then any other guy she will ever meet.
5XoK45rhaa	Honestly it sounds like somebody likes youuuu... <br>  i say if you and your bf and him and his gf aint so serious<br>  it wont be bad if you both dumped them its obvious you dont like each other anymore and what a jackass him texting your bestfreind !! <br>  i say you flirt with him back then make it into a relationship!|`|3R0LqsSSaa	wow nice  looks like someone likes you. I think you should figure out if that guy really likes you or is just playing. If you decide to go out with him break up with your boyfriend before you do anything. And if he likes you back he'll break up with his girlfriend <br>  good luck :)|`|CZAjVF7Zaa	Okay, this is slightly confusing, so I'm going to give advice on the bits I picked out.<br>  <br>  First, from the signs, I think this guy likes you, but in the end I'm reading your acounts on a computer screen and you're actually living it, so the final conclusion is up to you.<br>  <br>  Second, NEVER make a move on a guy who has a girlfriend.  Even if she is a b*tch, this will only make you seem shallow.  <br>  <br>  Also, I think you should talk to your boyfriend about his texting your friend, as suppressing your anger will only damage your relationship.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you do decide you like this guy, tell him how you feel.  If he says he likes you back, make sure you each break up with you girl/boyfriend before making a move.  After that, go for it!<br>  <br>  Anyway, hope this helps, and good luck!|`|QPdYQeUkaa	This guy sounds like a jerk. He may have a little too much self- esteem. Some guys go after all kinds of girls just because they know their hot. Your boyfriend has cancer which is really sad. You should support him. Cheating on him will make you a terrible person. Dumping him may make him sick.|`|7OTJW7fAaa	All of you are so young.  You are flirting and playing with one another because you are trying to discover how to connect with the opposite sex, and trying to figure out what you want in a boyfriend/girlfriend.  None of you should be exclusively dating because you are going to continue to be attracted to others.  <br>  <br>  You need to ask flirting science boy what he means by all his attention.  He could be just playing because he can.  If he considers his girlfriend to be an exclusive girlfriend, he shouldn't be playing games with you.  Keep in mind, if he breaks up with her and becomes your boyfriend, he will continue to flirt with other girls who catch his eye.  <br>  <br>  You all should agree not to be boyfriends/girlfriends, but just to hang out with each other and have fun until you are old enough to choose to be exclusive and have it really mean something.|`|NxsUEHoYaa	ok well at first i thought it was stupid that you were mad that your bf is flirting when your doing the exact same thing but then when i read that you have only been going out for 3 weeks it really doesnt matter....you should just kiss the science friend at your locker and break up with your bf cuz science guy obviously likes you but keep in mind that if he is this flirty with you when you guys arent going out and he was a gf then he is probably this flirty with alot of girlss...so be careful!! <br>  good luckk

You seem to have an exuberant attitude that is a beautiful quality.  I'd personally give you a 7.  <br>  <br>  Your not a skinny minnie, as you know, but you have the body of a woman.  At this point boys your age aren't interested in girls who look like a woman.  I honestly think it scares the hell out of them.  When you hit college though....things will change.  The vast majority of men (not boys) don't want stick thin or the prepubescent look.  They like women w/ a little meat on their bones not fat but some softness and roundness. Think hourglass figure.|`|oQcrq39Eaa	You're pretty - great eyes nice smile.<br>  <br>  I suspect that the tiny bit of extra weight you are concerned about is still baby fat that will go away as you get into your late teens.

wmDGGxH8aa	it depends on how fancy the place is. <br>  if it's like really fancy a 4-5star rated, u can wear a dress with any heels<br>  <br>  if it's like a normal, semi fancy, u can wear a blouse (nice one) and wear jeans with heels, of course the heels would be better close toe or show a lil toe as possible.<br>  <br>  if it's like a watever place, wear anything u want. <br>  <br>  as for boots, the leather one or etc would be great, the furry and the cotton kind would be very informal.. kinda a bad choice.|`|SbGXZCrjaa	Ok so what about nice fitting pair of jeans etc, with a small heel to make you feel a little more glam. And a fancy top to dress the jeans up??<br>   Or....<br>  I love wearing tights at the minute, i mean they just go with absolutely anything, and they can be worn for day wear, evening wear...etc.(and perfect for these colder months! )<br>  Do you maybe have something cute you could put with them??<br>  Hope ive given you a few idea's.....Have fun!!!|`|FLPRFTccaa	a shell suit.

v9Zv9aGzaa	of course, hell yeah thats sexy!|`|vH89r7vzaa	Personally I prefer longer hair. But what i would say is: don't strive to be like a celeb in looks etc. A real guy- one who likes a girl for who she is not what she looks like- prefers a girl who is herself. What i mean by that is don't start using loads of fake tan and silly amounts of makeup and going really O.T.T. for a guy- no problem with 'dressing up' for a date or anything, and i don't mean you shouldn't use cosmetics, but  be your natural self!|`|MTPoGd1qaa	I do like Vanessa Hudgens' hair!, mine doesn't seem to want to grow that long!<br>  <br>  I don't think guys really prefer any, it is more the face and personality!|`|AA11243051	idk well i do but for some reason i dont care i like shiny hair but i prefer long like second pic|`|IpzapGwgaa	i don't know i have the same question...... i am 13 year old girl..|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	I have a hair fetish and LOVE number 3..

nmQZIYutaa	We all want kids but I don't believe you should have one just yet. Are you two married? If not why have a child out of wedlock get married first then start a family. Let him finish school and get established first. So just in case you get laid off or whatever the case maybe he will be able to support you. Get into your own place first to secure your independence and see if you can truly live on your own paying your own bills and managing your own lifestyle.<br>  <br>  To do list:<br>  <br>  Let him finish his schooling and get stable...<br>  Get your own place and seek independence from grandparents<br>  Move in together<br>  Get married<br>  Then have a baby...<br>  <br>  Not so hard to do right?

So, in the long run, it would cause a lot of problems. <br>  <br>  One of my friends gave my boyfriend a lap dance a while back, and I was pretty uncomfortable with it.

Personally I consider it cheating cause they are going to someone else for sexual arousal.  But some people have the mentality that only oral or physical sex is cheating.|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	I would say No. Its a lap dance no touching kissing or anything involved.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	What you need to do is immediately tell them you arent interested in that kind of talk and say goodbye. Boys want sex, it is the main thing on their minds and they will scope out any girl to see if shes going to take the bait. Don't allow them to talk to you that way. The more respect you show yourself, the more you will get from others. They will call you a prude and other things to "save face" but so what. If they do that they arent a friend, they are just users you do not need in your life. There are a few boys who will like you for you and not use you but the only way to know who they are is to keep your self respect and do not allow yourself to be used, even in a conversation. Some guys get a thrill from just talking about sex and if you talk to them and even stay on the phone objecting, they get a thrill from that too, so say bye and hang up.|`|Vv465eJMaa	It will almost certainly be due to your appearance.Are you dressing sexually aggressive and looking sluttish through it|`|OHfcGAgIaa	you're seriously naive. For a start you're obviouly hanging around with a***holes. You should tell them straight and not put up with it, if was going out with a girl who had lads calling her in the middle of the night (regardless of the subject) I'd go off the hinges.|`|0lwGsRNqaa	Well it's because we are guys. As long as you are a female with female organs men will try to have sex with you. The only way to stop it is to get a sex change or become very ugly.|`|ngtNT23Xaa	Stop leading them on? No offence, if you want to be friends don't flirt, just chat casually.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	see now thats where your wrong we don't just want one thing we might want to do it twice|`|LdvaRCbaaa	if u have a boyfriend then just focus on him if u love him and if u tell him all of this and say that he isn't one of the other boys and then u will be happy with him so just focus on him and if he loves u he will focus on u and if u keep getting the phone calls tell the freaks that u got a bf and to just back off|`|263q3x2yaa	Wait wait wait....You have a boyfriend, but you are talking to guys to get them to ask you out? Or are you flirting with them, only to have them realize that you have a boyfriend? Either, that's not right. You will get no sympathy from me.
rIzx4OEWaa	Hello Bambi,<br>  <br>  Cool down an think about what you are saying, The idea for a good relationship is trust it sounds like you wish to own him an in stead will kill him off with your clinging on to him, ease of a little. We have all been there at some time my wife was living in Australia an we only ever saw each other a few times all our relationship was via letters or over the telephone but we managed to hang in there. We have been married 33 years this week.<br>  Try to make him want to be with you write to him an say how you are feeling but stay off the telephone until he has had time to get your letter.<br>  Let him do the running if you keep him interested by making things harder for him every now an then it will drive him crazy to get hold of you an not the other way around give it a try,|`|B1GjfOUdaa	If you need to ask us its not love you would know if it was.|`|0030f5e590ff16086572cdefc7f73ce4aa	not love|`|y499zJUzaa	maybe your just upset of the fact that hes so far away from you. but if you love him then you wouldnt let such a small promblem overcome your guys relationship.tell him that you have to tell him something when your on the phone.and just tell him how you feel. trust is always the key in a relationship=) and pluss let him know that you get really anxcious for him to call you back but he takes to long.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	You're not in love.

1rmSuG2Haa	BOTH!<br>  <br>  For me, I find it soooooo adorable if a guy is very shy and quiet at first. Nervousness is really cute in the beginning and shows that you sincerely like someone (or you wouldn't get so nervous!).<br>  <br>  But, of course, have enough b@lls to say something (even if you are scared) to get the ball rolling. And once the ice is broken, I love talking for hours with someone. =)<br>  <br>  A mixture of both is perfect!|`|T87pwfi4aa	There's a difference between shy and quiet.<br>  I heart shy guys.<br>  But hate quiet guys.<br>  I like guys that are shy at first, but are talkative after they get to know you.<br>  Does that make any sense?|`|kHMQhpJaaa	deffinetly shy! :)<br>  <br>  hang in there buddy!|`|8SywDHCZaa	It's always good when the guy starts up a conversation but not when they totally take over and don't let you get a word in lol.. shy guys can be cute though ;]<br>  xx|`|lPDRQH7aaa	In between. Not too shy because then it would be very quiet and awkward because I am kind of shy :)|`|ISMColXfaa	Balance it out please! But compared to talkative, I'd like shy and quiet.|`|stQjvvQYaa	talkative.  but not when they only talk about themselves.  when guys are quiet its awkward, but when they ramble on about themselves, they seem like tools.  talk but talk about general things, not all stories that try to make you look good|`|mjTGmemraa	talkative but not too talkative cuz most girls want to be the ones talking|`|HYUkWYrNaa	talkative- but not over confident and full of themselves.

Swtvqg8jaa	I would take some time away from him so that you can learn how to depend on yourself more. Find a friend you trust that you can call when you are feeling down. Talk to a Dr about your depression before it gets out of hand,<br>  You really need to take life into your own hands. You should never give anyone as much power and energy as you give your boyfriend, because you end up losing yourself.<br>  I went through this with my husband of 7 years now....when we first started dating I was SO dependant on him. He fell into depression and so did I, he fell into drugs and so did I. Eventually I realized I wasn't living for me, but for him! So I created some distance for a while to find myself again. 7 years later I am now pregnant with our second child and don't need him to love myself.<br>  So you might find having time away from him you feel better and so does he. And if it doesn't work out that way it just means it wasn't meant to be!<br>  Good luck!|`|mHETndPiaa	each week try to see less of him. soo at the start see him for a few hours a day then gradually bring to smaller amounts like twice a week. also buy a dog or a cat to give you company soo your not alone. and go out with your girl friends more theyl give you company and make you have a good time. just think that he loves you !|`|r8hBvWEQaa	I feel exactly the same as you do. I tried breaking up with my boyfriend because it didn't feel like he wanted to see me as much as before, but suffering with depression it made me feel even worse so i dont know if you'd be better just trying to cope with seeing him a little, and get some help for your depression if you can
MLjagYw3aa	Well, the guy seems like a jerk, no offense duck but im pretty sure you deserve better :D <br>  <br>  I had a similar situation, if he does come back to you don't fall for it, if he does it once whats stopping him do it again. <br>  <br>  If he does it with you he'll do it to you; remember that too.<br>  <br>  If he's saying that to you if you too do end up together; he may do the same to you as he has this other chick. <br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie|`|MQD7bP0Baa	Tell him he's nothing to wait for qand he's a shovenist swine, because quite frankly he sounds like a nob hed. You sound like a nice girl and i don't think this guy really deserves you in the first place. Eat lots of chocolate too, it's been scientifically proven that chocolate can raise happy chemical levels in your body (especially in women). Hope this helps hey!

The having someone else is a little suggestive that the other partner might not be good enough.  It goes against that commitment thing for me.  Also how could you trust that they wouldn't be thinking about it or the other person all the time instead of you?|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Let someone else join in.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Another person.  <br>  <br>  Anal.....well, my man has been talking me into this one.....I told him I would at least give it a try.<br>  <br>  That's about it.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Clean it.|`|U4Rf1rjuaa	I agree! that is something that would make me feel as if we were over if we had to go that far to make it fun.If he or i felt we needed to include someone else i would feel our relationship and love life was doomed!|`|BJXPRQVsaa	i dont think i would be able to try anal.<br>  - the thought of it scares me to be honest.<br>  <br>  apart from that i would be up for anything.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	No entering in the exit-only door!

But just about anything else I think.|`|uBssj3Znaa	I agree with you. <br>  <br>  I think whatever we do should be keep just between us.

QPKgc1xJaa	Romans 12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.|`|7YTiooX5aa	My ex husband was a real jerk he cheated on me and was very abusive anyway while we were still together and I was PG. he was always making me do this or that anyway he had been having me get him a drink cook this clean that and when I was finally done with everything or so I thought he wanted a sunday, so I made him one: Two big scoops of Crisco shorting, chocolate syrup, nuts, strawberries and whipped cream!!! He didn't trust me for awhile but he also learned a lesson. Then when I finally had enough of the beatings and being cheated on i left him for a very great guy and who happened to be a friend of his. Pay back is a B**CH!!!!!|`|gkThLcf2aa	Nah, vengence is petty. Although i was thinking of giving my ex a little tube for snorting coke shaped like a vacuum cleaner to make fun of her addiction, but left it as just a thought :)|`|JqVU84yLaa	well i was gonna have an answer until you said ..>>no killing please..<br>  well i guess you could scratch up his car or slash his tires or something like that|`|AA11367901	They are usually sorry for their actions.

Like if they have a best friend that you know of and that yall used to hang out with I would start hanging out with him. Not having sex or anything, but making him jealous. And believe me thats the best revenge.|`|j9QxxfBGaa	Have I done it? Yes.<br>  Do I regret it? No.<br>  Would I do it again? No.<br>  The best revenge is to just get on with your life...if your ex sees your happy despite the breakup he will notice and question what he meant to you..even if your devastated fake it till you make it|`|A4GeVvUeaa	Shave off one of his/her eyebrows when you get the chance. He/her will either have to shave off the other one or just have one eyebrow for a few months.

You won't end up hurting your ex, you'll hurt yourself more...|`|2Rw1ds9Yaa	embarass him a few times(without him knowing it was you).|`|xZI6noJiaa	Oh yeah, I've done it. My ex lied about having cancer, lied and said he needed a heart transplant, lied and said he had only 3 months to live so he could explain away his treating me like sh!t- you know, cuz he was just going through so much. .<br>  <br>  Rule #1 for revenge against an ex- Patience, patience patience. You don't want them to even think about you possibly being the culprit. I waited over a year to get him back. It involved termites and his house...|`|seMpUL8Kaa	Although revenge sounds fun, whatever it is, you would regret it because unlike them, you have feelings. So i would just leave them alone. You showing that you have moved on is the best thing, don't show them that you are still bitter.|`|0AsL26sSaa	I honestly would just get over it and move on. No, i have never done it and  have never regretted not doing it.|`|05aKFYl5aa	personally, i think it's childish
7jkS5Cklaa	I know this is going to sound like the lamest answer ever, but time. It takes time to get over someone. The worst thing to do is jump into another relationship immediately. Just wait until you feel you are over the previous one, and give yourself time to heal.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	dont rush yourself into another relationship when you know you arent ready. you might not be, but trying to prove that you can move on too wont work. only time can really tell be patient my friend.|`|Va96He2Saa	ok what you wanna do is murder him and preserve his body, this way you will never have to let go and if you get into a relationship with another man he wont me angry because he'd be dead and the new guy would know not to leave you|`|qRwykCMoaa	cry at times if you have to (it's better than keeping everything inside)<br>  read a book<br>  stay away from that person<br>  avoid any type of contact<br>  volunteer and help the community<br>  hang out with friends often<br>  don't give urself time to think about that person<br>  confide in someone if you can to get ur feelings out<br>  write a poem or story about how you are feeling<br>  Listen to music that isn't depressing(especially if you're going to go on a walk)<br>  don't watch depressing movies, see a comedy, or horror film<br>  don't give up on yourself<br>  try to avoid all things that remind you of that person<br>  if you own anything given to you from him/her get rid of it right away (it will give you a sense of relief)<br>  if you have to see the person (such as school, work, etc.) don't make eye contact and try to think of something else right away.<br>  <br>  It's funny cuz people keep asking the same questions.
GwwY1BGQaa	to me it sounds like they are fb's. I wouldn't give up yet but just keep it cool for a while dont get to attatched to something that is not happening. Maybe she will start liking you if you stay around and be friends for the moment. But dont let her play you either. It is not cool if she is flirting with you but doing freaky things with another guy on the side.<br>  <br>  hope I helped.<br>  :)|`|8lMb2w5Vaa	Well dnt give up <br>  && move on come on <br>  She already lyks dat guy

There are many possibilites to why a person does something.

fSkt7SgDaa	Ya I've been there. Us guys just get defensive when you try to pin stuff on us. Honestly even though it may hurt you should take a break for a while and if he wants you back he will make it happen.|`|gDfMpbTGaa	break|`|z6YwEjlpaa	I've been there before as well. Well, if the relationship is driving you nuts you might want to give it a break for a while or for good whatever it is that YOU decide. I give this advice to you because I believe that when you are in the position you are in and you don't even give yourself the chance to explore that break up, you won't ever know if it was the right thing to do or not. Then if you don't, you'll just end up back where you are at right now...asking yourself should I or shouldn't I?. I would say try it and even if things turn ugly at least then you know if it makes you feel better or not, and like the a poster previously said, if he wants you back, he'll make it happen.|`|NBBRWd5Gaa	he might get defensive in the heat of the moment but despite arguing with you, does he take your opinions into consideration in the end?  if the answer is no, then he is not the one for you.

Uj5kuzoJaa	All you have to do is go into Target or Walmart or ANY music store and ask them what guitar books they recommend for beginners. Buy a couple and maybe even go buy her a couple hours worth of guitar lessons. <br>  <br>  If you want to buy her clothes, just go into her room and look at the size tags on the back of her shirts or pants. If you can't figure out your sisters size, then you're really not trying hard enough. If you're strapped for cash, go to the clearance racks at Hollister, or American Eagle. She'll never know that you bought them on sale and you'll be able to get more things for her.<br>  <br>  If you want to get her books and you don't know what type of books to get her, then buy her a gift card to either Barnes & Noble or some used book store near where you live. Barnes & Noble is expensive so it might be a better idea to buy a gift card to a used book store. <br>  <br>  Quit being difficult. You can't give an excuse for every suggestion someone makes. Just pick something. My sister is lucky if I remember her birthday lol|`|9LqHgmcLaa	you can download guitar tabs off the internet or check into guitar lessons.|`|wSnA8vTlaa	get her some clothes from American Eagle or other preppy cloth stores. and maybe some earrings and necklaces to match with the shirts.|`|lgXdZ7TFaa	A gift card to a bookstore or ask her what books she interested in then go find some on that genere or topic.|`|8D7T43bKaa	Guitar books to help her learn to play|`|Po2UqfvWaa	give her your time. go to the movies, out to eat, an ice cream, etc

As of today he has removed exactly one rack of cd's. He has an office (which was mine until he invaded with all his stuff) and it's almost full too. I gave him til 4/1 to move stuff out of that room or I will. He says he'll divorce me if I do but I think it's not a sincere threat.

qQWYeOpgaa	I'm sorry kaley i thought that he would think we were talking about someone else.|`|jUuYMVqiaa	really he might just think your cute. i mean 13 is kinda young for a 16 year old to date? like i think younger people might be cute but i wouldnt Ever date them. its just kind of gross.|`|Qe95LNxYaa	gibberish|`|TZfDvyshaa	NO, he's not ashamed or anything. he just doesn't want his sister to know about his personal life. for example: if my younger brother went up to me and asked me if i was dating one of his friends, and the friend could hear i would be SO embarrassed for myself in case his friend heard and freaked out so i'd be like "OF COURSE NOT!" because he might disapprove of me dating his friend and the friend might not like me. he was just awkward in the situation that's all. nothing personal on you at all :D the only thing is that now you say that you are only 13, he might not fancy you....simply because you are too young and inexperienced. none of my 16 year old friends would go near a 13 year old to be completely honest sweetie.|`|L4jMOVvPaa	with him sayin NO! then that to me says that he likes you but he doesnt want to addmit it.<br>  <br>  he wants you to be happy. he shows tht by acompanying you when you went to the swings by your self and when he stayed out of the tub.<br>  <br>  you should get more conversations started then ask him. maby you dont need any more convo's i dont know but it couldnt hurt to try!|`|ywRowtA1aa	I don't want to answer a question with a question but I am curious how old you are. <br>  Regardless, don't always worry about what your friends think, unless the person you like is into something dangerous or illegal.<br>  <br>  "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"<br>  <br>  If you like him, then keep hanging out with him and see what happens. you shouldn't be in a hurry.|`|NxsUEHoYaa	he prob does like you if he kept on doing everything you were doing...and he said noo like that because he isnt sure if you like him to and didnt want it to be weird...you should tell him that you like him cuz it really sounds like he likes you too....<br>  good luckk!|`|ig0NVeOXaa	Hmm probably he didnt want his sister to know... idk. gurl but most likely he doesnt like you unless he likes yu ou but doesnt want to show it .. thats the problems with guys you never know what they want or what they feel cause they always try to hide it ! uNfortunately :(|`|EpPY4NNzaa	well he obviously does. he's just being defensive cause he's embarrassed. it's not you though|`|7jkS5Cklaa	Awww...<br>  <br>  It really does sound he likes you. Don't worry about what other people think, do what you think is best for yourself.|`|CjvrTRVBaa	he said no. hes not interested, sorry|`|WVzsrJGXaa	he probably does like you but to shy to admit it|`|FjOaPK2Baa	that was short actually...compared to others...<br>  <br>  if he does really like you but said no, he is immature. If he said the no in a simple way and not embarrassed then he is just telling the truth.<br>  <br>  That is really messed up that your friends said that... It's not like he said he liked you. They shouldn't have said it infront of him because he didnt do anything besides go there to play halo...<br>  <br>  Gamertag? lol|`|yEt3ofnhaa	Why not be direct and ask him? If he makes up a story "well, I don't want other people to know that I am dating you" then he is not worth your time. If he can be direct with you when you ask me " do you like me?" Then it will be hard to take each other serously.|`|aZX8ltttaa	You obviously both like each other.<br>  So one of you needs to let the other know for something to happen.<br>  <br>  Get him alone and ask him does he like you. Worst he can say is "not in that way" and you remain friends.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|dWTqmBbyaa	he probably isnt that into, yet... but you can make that happen. ask him to go to the movies and get to know him better. once he knows you he might start to like you.|`|3CBWubtAaa	i bet he does like you<br>  it gets annoying how little kids jump to conclusions, so he was probably frustrated with her|`|wmnSnTxZaa	I'm sure he likes you. You should ask him out yourself. And if you're bothered by what your friends say, don't be. If you like him then what others say doesn't matter. <br>  <br>                                Wow that sounded sappy.|`|DoKXlLL3aa	Hmmm maybe...idk he may not though.

After the terrible mortal plunging the victim suffered, he had to be identified by his dental records.
Uj5kuzoJaa	Sounds like he likes you!!! Yay!!! Next time he asks you who you would go out with in your class you should say "You, if you'd ask me" hahaha it woould be soooooo cool. And if he says no then act like it doesn't bother you, just say "ok, oh well then" and act cool even if it hurts your feelings. You'll look awesome. Good luck<br>  <br>  And it really does sound like he likes you|`|YxOWoBZYaa	remember when u like someone u always want them to loke u back so little things they do u would think more of it|`|5Oovp6yaaa	well to me it seems that he does like you he just dont know how to tell you and he dont want to ruin yalls friendship.<br>  cause i yalla re really good friends then dating might ruin the friendship and he might not want to do that.<br>  But give it time cause he might relaly like you. =]|`|2yVRuX0yaa	Yeah he likes you but i think hes just to shy to tell yo that. You need to be sincere with him tell him you like him. If you kiss him he will like you but you have to throw the kiss unexpectedly and see what he thinks. :) Hope i helped!|`|fqdIVD3Yaa	I wouldn't want try and make the first move... or ask him too many questions on that topic whether or not he likes you. Maybe you should just let whatever happens happen. Don't ruin a good friendship over "dating"
557f121bfd3b4b87eb6c5214cbb1e223aa	I'd bank it.  I'd tell him, but depending on where the money came from would I ask him for suggestions on how to spend it.  Inheritance, investments that you made, etc. should be your call, but if it's something joint like from the sale of something you both owned, then he should get half of the proceeds.<br>  <br>  My spouse and I would probably disagree on what to do with it.  He's simple minded and doesn't want or need much.  I, on the other hand, would want to use some of it for enjoyment - not all... just some.

Frankly, if a couple communicates with each other, they would not disagree about what to do about money.|`|kCbJ89nXaa	Money is no good to you unless you find a purposeful way to spend it save it or invest it.

Make a decision you both can live with.|`|ji1g8iDgaa	As someone who works at a bank I'd say deposit it into 2 different accounts.

Just make sure it's not one of those rubber checks where those people are trying scamming you.|`|AqU180claa	No. You could hide it. That way you could get to it faster.|`|xNWqqlcYaa	what good would a hidden check be?|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Is it legitimate?

She could end up pregnant or with an STI, and although she might say she's 'ready' it's almost certain that she isn't.  Losing your virginity is a BIG DEAL and should be a carefully considered decision with someone you love, not with a guy you've only been dating for a few days!  Talk to her and try to persuade her not to do it.  Tell her about the risks involved, and remind her that it's illegal if she's under sixteen!  If she still insists, tell an adult before this goes too far and she does something she regrets.  She might not appreciate it now, but in the long run you'll be doing what's best for her.|`|57oKcPdBaa	I think you should tell her your opinion, but let her choose for herself.

2aWNvPOiaa	I have been in your same situation a long time ago, and after we fought so much about it and i stood my ground he promised and swore up and down about how he quit and doesnt do it anymore, and eventually the truth came out that he was lying and going behind my back doing it, I was so hurt but at the same time if he hasnt stopped by now, its his choice and as hard and painful the nights and couple weeks will be its best to let him go. Even if he promises to quit would you be willing enough to trust him for his word and not ever nag about it and drop it? I doubt it. Good luck in your situation, and just know there are tons of people out there who feel the same and in the end it will be worth it and you'll find someone to respect you enough to not ever smoke it.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Honestly, pot is not that big of a deal. Almost everyone who smokes it can still function, goes to work, doesn't lie, cheat or steal. In 5 years I can't imagine it still being illegal, people who smoke pot are LESS likely to be violent or commit crimes. It isn't physically addictive, just mentally because it's calming.<br>  <br>  If you're arguing that much about it, then make him choose. It's his life too and if he wants to smoke it.... I guess it depends what it is that bothers you so much about it, and if he's still doing the daily things he needs to do, and how important it is to you.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	I had that problem.  It wasnt that my bf smoked pot.  People are going to do recreational drugs and drink.  Thats all there is to it.  they are going to and you cant stop him.  its who he is and it is a decision he has made.<br>  <br>  my problem was that my bf smoked SO much that it was all he talked about.  When we hung out he was high, coming down off of one, or talking abotu when he was going to smoke next.  I hated when he smoked around me and and I hated that he would rather go out with his friends and smoke than have sex with me!<br>  <br>  SO...is it ok if your bf smokes pot?  i mean its illegal...but in the long run...no...its not going to hurt anyhting.  if hes smoking so much that he sounds liek my bf did...he wont get the picture.  I broke up with my bf for him to finally realize.  I was so upset, but we got back togehter and things are better now.<br>  <br>  my point is that you shouldnt make a mountain out of a molehill.  Ask him not to smoke aroudn you and that he only do it on his guys night out.  its not an unreasonable request.<br>  <br>  anyway...thats my two cents.|`|dRiH2Uszaa	call the police, scare the CRAP out of him, it will stop him from smoking but call them first and let them know the situation|`|LGCLmUTnaa	I don't know... but you seem like a person who deserves someone better than someone who smokes pot and argues about it.|`|2zKBJkM8aa	If you feel like you come second to weed, that's a big red flag that he has an addiction.  It seems to me your boyfriend may be addicted weed.  Most likely he is smoking because that is how he deals with stress.  If he's irritated, he goes for a smoke.  If he just got some bad news, he goes for a smoke.  He may also smoke weed because he's relaxed and he wants to feel more relaxed.<br>  <br>  What all of this means is that if he does smoke to unwind and he quits, then that will cause him freak out.  Quitting one addiction is tough, real tough.  So by quitting marijuana, he may compensate by doing something else.  This is called transfer addiction.  If he stops smoking, he could quite possibly start drinking excessive amounts of alcohol (become an alcoholic), start binge eating, become a sexaholic-- anything to replace the calming fix he got from weed.  <br>  <br>  If he stops smoking and you don't want him to transfer his addiction to another addiction, he needs to learn healthy ways to calm himself down.  Whether its meditation, deep breathing exercises, release his frustration through sports or exercise; whatever.  As long as he has a healthy alternative to smoking weed.<br>  <br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is if he really wanted to stop smoking he would have done it by now.  If he's going to stop he has to do it for himself, not for you, not for his friends and not even for his family.  It's a personal choice.  And personally, it sounds like he enjoys maintaining this smoking lifestyle.  <br>  <br>  Basically it boils down to if this has become one of your deal breakers.  Will you be okay with him never quitting?  Can you still be in a happy & healthy relationship with your boyfriend despite these annoyances? If the answer is no, you may want to reconsider your future with this man and whether or not you two are right for each other.  Rather, is he right for you?<br>  <br>  I hope the best for you, you sound like a sweet girl.|`|FwiK6WJTaa	I you think its the right thing dump him. but remember if you do hold on to him try to get him to stop smoking it. It hurts to fight, I know but when and if you fight, remember that your trying to save his life. Literally.
d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	Honey you didn't say how old you are.  You mentioned that 'he' is 23, if this is significant enough to mention does that mean your quite young?  I mean if your 15 -16 and this guys 23 I'd say that he wants to keep very far away (should he know what's best for him)  Otherwise I'd bet that he's hoping that he had wit enough to think of something better to say than 'good evening'.  You know men aren't completely useless, if they want to go out with you they are perfectly capable of asking without all this 'what does he mean' drama.|`|dm0tGwKNaa	He Probably Wanted Your Number Or Something, I Think He Liked You !|`|eq0tJ90Haa	sounds like he fancies you ;D|`|2pi1H46Vaa	He's a man.

If you just write a note, he will either pretend nothing happen or become a stalker.<br>  <br>  LOL wow 2 days....<br>  <br>  I guess the letter isn't that bad. It depends on his ego/personality. If he is mature, tell him straight up.|`|5CJ3rnlWaa	Just do it.<br>  <br>  I think you should do it somewhere where you two can be alone and talk about it though, rather than writing him a note during class. <br>  <br>  Just think...How would you feel if you were on his end? In the middle of class, you got a note saying 'I don't think we should be together'..? That would be the worst thing ever.|`|hmVvpvyaaa	umm. u cant end a relationship with a note, no online no phone no txt has to b in person|`|8e34660b9e9fbb9642013e17db1486f8aa	NONONONONOOOOOOOOOO<br>  break up w. him in personnn<br>  no noteess !<br>  thatss soooo stupid its like the taylor swift & joe jonas fone break up.<br>   thatsss soo retarded.<br>  i think you should tell him in person<br>  even though it will hurt him, you dont want to be w. him forever right?<br>  so go do ur thing and tell him in personnn.<br>  oor you can always do the stupid thing<br>  avoid him,<br>  move urseat.<br>  blah(;
US6CnMR1aa	Well.. First, I like his looks and it's really nice that he not like other guys who are jerks about the like/love thing. Umm, I don't know what to say. It seems he has an awsome personality, you 2 are a really cute couple. I think he might like you but just doesn't know how to show his own feelings for you. And at the same time he might be afraid because if your "relationship" goes bad, you to might get uncomfortable and might not be as good friends as you used to be. I've known lots of people who have ended up like that. Sorry for ending up on a bad note. I'm just dumbstruck, and don't really know how to answer this question. Sorry. :D Shelb|`|HRY7cD2yaa	Dear Kimberly - I know you're a contact somehow but...<br>  You are much much younger than me and have so much to learn, though I wouldn't probably be one of your best influences.<br>  For a start, I'm British.<br>  I drink and smoke too much.<br>  And besides, I have rotten teeth - literally they all need taking out.<br>  A consequence of living it up when I could, though I shan't blame American products, as it was my choice.<br>  Your crush looks... Well, like many other teenagers in wonderful company, and I hope you enjoy the companionship and fun.<br>  Here in the UK, we don't have all our kids wearing braces, but that probably explains why Americans quite rightly so make fun about our teeth.<br>  I'm sure you'll look stunning when you can rightly show your own, but in the meantime just realise we are constantly changing.<br>  Our mind goes into overdrive when we are asleep. Mine tends to be very depressive, though being old it is hardly suprising.<br>  I used to have the silliest of "crushes" at your age though was too shy to make things any more than that.<br>  We're all different though, so don't take too much notice of me.<br>  I feel ugly, yet my girlfriend loves me for what I am - albeit she's eight years older (though close to 9).<br>  In your forties and fifties though (scary when I was young), it don't really matter.<br>  Have a great life Kimberly.<br>  Follow your heart, and second time around it usually works better.<br>  I'm sure he fancies you - just be safe.<br>  <br>  Edit - This looks bad, but is in no way intended.<br>  Why no other answers?|`|GTXmMIU0aa	I think he likes you..

You should just be confident and determine whether of not you have a chance with her, maybe she may have a boyfriend, or maybe she has another crush. It shouldn't have to even apply to how you look, looks have nothing to do with it. <br>  <br>  And yes, you two look cute together, now go ask her out!

For instance, he could actually want a relationship and just happens to get too busy to call at some points, or he is waiting for you to visit. This could also mean that he only wants a relationship when he's in the "mood" for one. In other words, when he feels like being sweet to someone, he may be using you as that someone, but this may not be the case. Talk to him about it, ask him what he wants.

It really depends on her personality type as to whether you should be straight with her, because while some people appreciate straight talk, others are deeply wounded up by it.<br>  <br>  Nobody likes to be told they're wrong, and because we all have different perspectives about life in general, who gets to decide what or who is right or what and who is wrong?  If she's the hypersensitive type, you may have to find a gentler way of expressing your view about her situation, but without coming right out and telling her that she's wrong, but based on what you say, have her come to that conclusion on her own.  That way she won't be resenting you for your opinion and the relationship is more likely to survive.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Dude, a woman will never admit to being wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just agree with her on everything she says, and you'll have a much happier life
836d9fce0375ffcf90741051b73d8c82aa	Simplesimon, in my experience,(and believe me, I've had good and bad), I have learned that a fulfilling relationship is more important than sex!  Sex is the reward you get from being in a good relationship!<br>  To some people sex is more important, but they will spend the rest of their lives, looking for a meaningful relationship, and will be miserable trying to make a relationship last, based on sex!|`|7XIa76Usaa	Having sex is the most important thing there is in a exciting relationship. Good sex bonds two people together and if both people experiment together in any way they can dream of it helps in keeping both parties excited to be with each other. A man wants his mate to be aggressive at times and take full control from removing his clothing to being on top and go wild on him. So if you are sexually active or plan on being soon then start taking a birth control pill, condoms are know for breaking.
obo57lVpaa	Ignore him, maybe he feels attracted to you and doesn't know how to express it or hide it.He means trouble so stay away from him if you love your boyfriend.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Like your boyfriend suggested, do your best to get over it. I mean, you're dating the boyfriend, not the brother. The brother's opinions  of you shouldn't matter at all.<br>  <br>  And if you really don't like the brother so much, then suggest that you don't want to go to your boyfriend's house so often, so you can get over it faster.<br>  <br>  So just ignore the brother.
xoXkHOVsaa	I think you need to give up on him.  He sounds really shallow if he didn't want to date you because of your looks.  You are only going to end up hurt if you keep chasing him!

Honestly, I don't think the two of you have much of a future if you don't sleep with him.  I'm not telling you to I'm just saying that if the two of you want different things then it's not going to work out.  I can't tell from your question if you're really against having sex.|`|8IIVBPwkaa	If I were you, I'd sit him down and talk about some of the questions you have raised above.<br>  <br>  Nobody knows the answers except him, and if you are in a relationship together you need to communicate well with each other, especially about important things like sex.<br>  <br>  And don't do anything you don't want to do :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mmMgfhf2aa	Never have sex unless it feels natural.

If he understands, well then maybe he doesn't want you only for sex.|`|BTTFVbYYaa	a bloke talked my sister nto sex and when she did he finished with her some men just like the conquest is not about pleasing him if he really likes you he will wait if not sod him he can get lost your too beautiful you can do alot better.|`|zFvy4V43aa	Well...it does kindaa seem likee all he wantss is thatt<br>  && if his ex girlfriend has told u that <br>  then maybe that's a reason y she/he broke up<br>  i wudn't go out with that guy....<br>  by saying, he hadn't had sex for six months<br>  that pretty much sounds like he's <br>  gnna ask u....very SOON<br>  wudn't go out with him if i woz u
jrWpHYAPaa	It's true that there's nothing wrong with flirting. I'm like that too, i want to feel like i'm still wanted. It's just some people are very loyal and some are not like that naturally. You just need to find the right guy that can accept those things about you and is more open. Don't worry!  you'll find that guy soon enough. =)<br>  <br>  If your interested you could read about star signs to find out which star signs are loyal (like leo) and which ones aren't.|`|Qz4n1l0zaa	i have the same problem. some people consider flirty just smiling and making eye contact at the same time or touching or laughing. just ask your boyfriend what you do to make him mad that way you can start catching yourself and start making improvements.|`|BJXPRQVsaa	im the exact same way.<br>  <br>  it doesnt make you a bad person what so ever.<br>  You shouldnt have to change yourself for anyone.<br>  <br>  I think you shouldn't be tied down; just go out and have fun and go with the flow. whatever comes to you deal with it when it's in your face.<br>  <br>  dont worry about anything; your just wanting to have fun and their is no harm in that at all :)<br>  xx|`|bp6ud1AHaa	theres nothin bad wit flirting just dont do anythin wit the guy your flirting wit and dont let your boyfriend catch u lol

ychf3mM9aa	It means they are immature and not worth your time.|`|4Q4dZJHpaa	It means there just being a normal group of lads,esp younger lads just say dumb stuff like that to impress each other,don't take it to heart.|`|VmoOE3poaa	I think that when I guy bothers you or makes fun of you a lot, they like you. Although they call you brick, man hands and all those coward names, just be true to yourself because they are just playing around. You might be sensitive to jokes(harsh jokes) but just let them be and just ignore. :] hope I helped|`|QlvcSgn0aa	by the names youve listed, they just think youre a really big girl.|`|idwxEEEbaa	maybe i can help,|`|MmgNDqOQaa	it means they like u|`|pPZv2tTQaa	It's hard to say why they do it with out being there.  From the names they call you you are probably young and have some time before you 'develop'.  If your under 18 don't worry.  It's unfortunate they make fun of you and I wouldn't pay any attention to the names they call you.  It's probably just cause they feel cool all picking on you as a group.  Ultimately you have to decide how much it bothers you.  If it bothers you allot you need to have respect for yourself and not hang out with them.  If you still want to be their friends I would suggest coming up with names for them.  Use them all the time and learn to just appreciate what they call you or tell them not to do it and that it bothers you.  If they don't stop refer to my first suggestion.|`|7ZQtineiaa	It means they're a bunch of douchebags and you should surround yourself with people that aren't trying to make you feel bad about yourself.|`|xpcoUTYyaa	haha you must be huge
ivjHOJ8daa	What? No?<br>  My sister never got her first kiss til she was 18.<br>  <br>  One of my friends [who will be 24 in September] has NEVER had a kiss yet. Not even a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Don't worry... it will happen.|`|r8hBvWEQaa	Nope not really. Well considering how many 12 year olds have had sex on here it's probably alien that a 15 year old hasn't had a kiss, but really to me, it's not too bad.|`|SjD1aKT5aa	No, I'm 16 and never had a proper 1st kiss. Never the right time.<br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|8zfXJxxraa	Huhhh?????|`|LGCLmUTnaa	Some 15 year old girls (and boys) have kissed, some haven't.<br>  It doesn't determine their whole life/personality.<br>  It's as simple as that.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	No, that's completely normal. You see young teenage people whining about never getting their first kiss yet all the time. So don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go so much by age anyway.|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	Snogging = The British version of the American term "make-out". <br>  <br>  No I don't.

wBSkGfxjaa	You seem quite normal. Girls (I know--and remember) have serious crushes early.  Earlier than guys.  We have to live through them and during a crush it is VERY difficult to really see a guy the way he really is --- SO go very carefully.  This fellow seems like he could be bad news for you.  Hang out with some other guys for awhile.  Keep as clear headed as possible.|`|FpT7x2VVaa	nothing wrong, at fifteen it's way too early to settle on one. you have a crush, quite simple.<br>  enjoy the relationship or friendship, and remember, there will be many more in the years to come. just watch out you don't get used.
3SUjApfSaa	Well are you friendss do you talk pretty much every\now and then or daily babsis ill assume he is someone you talk to daily so maybe while your chitchatting about school mention you and friends are headin to the movies and he should join you guys its less intimidating than a one on one i like you approch get to become closer friends swap numbers text chat over facebook invite him to any parties you hear of once you become closer friends it will become obvious to see if he really likes you or just as a normal friend!!<br>  <br>  If you need anymore helps just email me!<br>  HOPE this HeLPsSSsSssssssssssssssssssssssssss|`|AYy9da7laa	maybe you should try talking to him in the halls. or see if you have any mutual friends and have them hook it up.|`|RafqT95Waa	i know how u feel about being shy, but just talk to him as a normal friends,<br>  go and sit by him in lunch or talk to him when he's not around with his friends, if u have a class with him just go up to him and be like- did u noe wut we had for homework and go from there|`|sLWC6vEmaa	Well you shouldn't make the move necessarily.

Uj5kuzoJaa	They have to make me laugh. That is the number one requirement. They also have to be at least ok looking and I don't personally care if they are popular or not. A lot of times the popular guys turn out to be a**holes. I look for someone who has friends and can make me smile|`|D5AepfDkaa	I don't look at how popular they are.  I look for if they are sweet to you and  if they are actually going to care.  Maybe sometimes their hottness.lol|`|a0d6a5b22638248686586476b790b4e4aa	I look for beauty, well, that's not the most important factor, but one of the most, charm, sophistication, I mean I hate girls who are obsessed with fashion, clothes, cosmetics,etc, I mean there's nothing wrong with being smart and fashionable but that must not be the only thing a girl cares about, then I love girls who have a rich sense of humor cause mine ain't no good;)|`|Tl9bgQzFaa	what i look for in a person is that they like me for me and not to like me for my stuff. A guy that is just concern about his self.
X5Fq3mOraa	Use the acne medicine<br>  Get contacts, or keep the glasses, some people think they are attractive.<br>  Get shampoo and conditioner for dry or damaged hair, like head and shoulders, etc.<br>  If you really want to, i think you can get your hair chemically straightened, but its not that big of a deal.|`|gXRz3U7Vaa	iif you got meds for your acne, it should clear up. i just got put on birth control for mine..<br>  <br>  i have glasses too and it sucks. if you really dont like them, try to get contacts (only i dont have the insurance for that).. or get a more stylish pair.<br>  <br>  my hair is a big curly fro that i normally have to straighten everyday too and it SUCKS. but lately i've just gotten lazy and i either wear it in a bun or down and curly with some good products in it. people seem to like it down and curly about the same as down and straight. so now i just straighten it when i have an important date or something lol.<br>  <br>  i used to feel insecure about all those things just as you are now,  but i simply stopped caring what other people thought about my looks. i just go to school with a "i dont give a damn" attitude.. and it doesnt bother me that much when i know i look like **** now. haha<br>  <br>  but good luck :]|`|77A0tlKtaa	You should get a short hair cut so it would be easier to take care of an use some straightening lotion keep from damaging your hair. And contacts deffinately!! And if you want you can upgrade your style and skinny jeans are very popular!!!|`|7cyqgJQnaa	have same acne problem so cant really help u there, but their are special shampoos for the dry hair, and their is contacts to replace those glasses. if you dont like contacts there is always laser eye surgery|`|gW4AgKqwaa	Well sounds like you got the acne part taken care off. If you don't like your glasses I suggest you get contacts. But if you don't like contacts buy some glasses that you feel confident in..it'll help. About the hair..I suggest you get your hair trimmed and get rid of all your split ends because that could be causing your hair a little more frizz then there already is. While your there ask them what products would help get rid of some of your frizziness. You should definitely (!!!!) buy a spray that helps protect your hair from hot tools (straighter) You need to spray it on your hair before every time you use it. I use a product that's in a pink container and it's by revlon. It's a see through bottle. I got it from my hair place. That will help tame your frizz. Hope I helped !<br>  <br>  <br>  xoxoxo|`|N2PxYfAkaa	try to get contacts, if you wear make up, wear natural looking make up, use anti-frizz shampoo & conditioner, and you said they gave you ointment for you acne, no? well just wait for that, be sure to clean your face daily and moisturize it.<br>  <br>  :)|`|aa9fm4uyaa	baby girl just use what you have to work with k you are probely quite beautiful|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	Everyone gets spots now and then, it's all part of being a teenage hormone inferno. I wish I could help you more here, but I only get the odd spot when I'm stressed so I don't know. Sorry sweetie.<br>  <br>  At least your glasses make your eyes look bigger, mine seem to have the opposite effect! Don't rule out the possibility of contact lenses, I have never tried them but they seem like a good idea.<br>  <br>  Finally, use heat protection, or go to a good hairdresser and ask them for advice. My hair is naturally wavy, but not frizzy, though I still choose to straighten it! I understand what you mean about it getting dry. I suggest change your hair products, and I certainly hope you're not washing it every day - if you are, sorry hun but you need to stop it.<br>  <br>  Now, self esteem...everyone is beautiful, every last one of us, even if others do not see it. Not everyone is going to see your beauty, but the ones that do are the ones that count. You're not jumbled up at all, you are the way the good lord intended, and you ARE beautiful.<br>  <br>  Stop feeling self conscious. Look around you. People don't care, they're getting on with their lives and so are you. Make the most of life, because you can. Life is such a precious gift, and I pray you will not waste it worrying about things like that.|`|0XGWM9nUaa	umm get contacts... and put your hair up when you dont feel like straightning it i have thick curly hair so it takes me 2 hours.........
OSLeTGh6aa	no, maybe at the first stages of the heartbreak yes.. but from every heartbreak you become stronger and the next time you fall in love you know exactly what to do and what not to do, and how to cope when you break up its all part of learning.|`|wLwtUzqKaa	not really but u become wise|`|v5PBHySzaa	heck yes..<br>  my first love i lost him about 6 months ago..<br>  ironically he has come runnig back..<br>  we had a flawless five years together age 15 to 20<br>  he left me and now regreats it..<br>  he wanted to be "young" and single... uni basically got to him<br>  and even tho he left me he never truly left me in his heart...<br>  we have begun talking again after 2months..<br>  and i saw him fir the first time in 6 months in feb..<br>  it was AMAZING..<br>  HE REGREATS EVERTHING<br>  IM TRIAMPHANT<br>  Getting over him was soo hard...soo hard<br>   i wod cry n cry n cry but time is a healer<br>  its true<br>  and before he came beggin back..<br>  i was very weary i was like whats the point..<br>  and still now im very much thinking i just want to marry someone for the money! lol<br>  but i dunno whn i get the feeling im sure it will be true love<br>  just till need to heal my heart i guess
xpUkgIyRaa	If a guy does not like to express the way he feels in front of his friends, its sounds like he may either be embarrassed of you, which is not good, you can do better than that, or he is looking for a one night stand. A guy who really cared about you wouldn't care what his friends think, maybe that's just me....|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	At that age, all guys just want to get in your pants|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i have this same problem but its not with a group of guys but a group of my friends who are females. And you think guys are bad. Its 10 times worse with females. If one of the females thinks you are showing too much attention to somebody else besides her she will do everything in her power to stop it. Cause that's just how it is, they are jealous. So i tend to just do one on one if im going to make some moves. You dont want anybody feeling left out. And im sure his friends would feel left out if every time you hung around the guys hes all over you. And about the comments of "he just wants to get your pants". That's every guy, so what. They can only go as far as you let them. if you want them to go there, they will, if you dont let them go there, they wont. <br>  <br>  Just except the fact that they respect their friends and dont want to leave in awkward situation, cause its totally weird watching you friend court another woman and everybody standing around watching.|`|RIRa9hUjaa	They do that because they want to get in your pants.  19 year old guys will pretty much bang anything that moves, weird or not.  However they don't want to be seen as weird in front of their friends.<br>  <br>  It's a sh!tty way to treat a woman, if you ask me.|`|AA10266072	I'm having a hard time getting what you're saying but I'm going to guess that they want to have sex with you but they don't want their friends to find out about it.|`|UwnXYMI4aa	because its one on one.|`|DiaXZSwEaa	cuz they want ure pussy|`|IQEf57ANaa	it is normal to do that for guys.  i mean guys are not going to be flirting with you if you have 4 other guys around you, first of all becuase the guy will look stupid and desperate. and secondly becuase he knows that to seduce you he need to have your complete attetion. <br>  <br>   dont make a big deal out of it. I mean , it sound like if you wanted all the guys to tell you " lets hook up " in front of everybody so everybody can see " oh she is so popular ". come on , be happy that at least when you are alone with the guy, he wants to hook up, that is what really matters.|`|LrAd0OQZaa	its because when your with a group they don't want to flirt with you around that group and you shut them down in front of all his friends. So when hes alone he can be himself and flirt and if he gets shut down its between you and him and not you him and like five other guys that witnessed the shut down. Im just winging it but yea i think that's why seriously<br>  cheers|`|EFGKxSsVaa	some guys do this all the time.<br>  it's usually because in a group of people, they don't really know what to think of you, but when you're one on one, then they have all the time they need to see what you're really like...<br>  <br>  I dont really know how to explain it, but guys will be guys.|`|e4317ce8f4113b0065b75473f383c255aa	Most likely if he's saying that in private, then your most likely ugly and he wants to have sex with you, but doesn't want his friends to know because if your ugly it can ruin his rep, but still wants to have sex. :)|`|mmks8Dyuaa	Hm. i don't think you should trip over about hook ups right away<br>  if a guy wants to date you, he'll make that obvious <br>  and saying " i actually think they think im weird... " with a topid "adults only on this site is pretty odd :O|`|3uI0JAAwaa	Cause when we treat you like dirt, you stick to us like mud...They act cool around friends and play you off because then you want to get them alone to see if he will be sweet, and since you have a vagina he will be.|`|v96pYAg1aa	That guy secretly wants u and found a chance to say it...when u guys are alone its easier to admit feelings than saying it in front of people|`|GBkZFYcVaa	I'm not entirely sure what you are trying to say...<br>  I'm interpreting this as: <br>  Girl Likes Boy.  <br>  Boy doesn't give Girl time of day when he's in front of other people. <br>  When Boy and Girl are alone, Boy is all over Girl.<br>  <br>  Some guys are shy/insecure enough around their guy friends that they don't want to lose face by seeming mushy or "whipped."  And I would give them like a little leeway (say 2 dates?) to let them get over this immaturity.  However, if this is an ongoing thing, where he ignores you in public and is all over you in private - He's Just Not That Into You.  He wants you for one thing, and unless you are down for that type of backdoor fling, get out.|`|mIuUQ4ehaa	Right then ...<br>  It is a regular thing... its basically the guy could like you inside but some of his mates might not like you, or they might like you so he doesn't want to get with you cause he could lose his mate.<br>  <br>  Confusing i got this|`|lgXdZ7TFaa	they want a random hook up and they probably dont think your that good looking so they won't aprroach you in that way in public.|`|C0xoYXDvaa	your age group is the reason why women think we are all the same and want only one thing. The other reason is me|`|Jhr68T0baa	Sounds ashamed of you.
WBB83iBvaa	i used to not get mad about it.....<br>  <br>  until he started cheating on me over and over........ <br>  <br>  then on day he started dating one of my friends, i went to confront him.. she got in my face, i pushed her down..... then he came after me so i punched him... we got in this big fight i came out with a black eye and 2 broken fingers..... he came out with a black eye, a couple broken ribs, and his arm was fractured in 3 places............<br>  <br>  <br>  i haven't dated a dude since, but i did date a couple of girls :)|`|IQEf57ANaa	it is bad to be a jealous person, it is better to relax and enjoy your relationship. I believe that you partner has the right to look at other people, now if he start flirting with them, then you have a problem. try to take life more easily, there is not point in getting worried about this kind of things.|`|GJycKc5Laa	i dont. i prefer pretty relaxed relationships.

In my opinion its not to bad|`|2JPRTMIJaa	My daughter is 14, and she is looking, just don't under up like my OTHER daughter (who is 17), and end up pregnant.|`|82niQjyCaa	depends what kind you mean, if you talk all serous then yes it is too young, but at that age its fine to play about just not go all the way|`|AA11618466	Well it most definitely won't be a serious one. Kids are too young at that age. <br>  <br>  But once you get into high school & you experience more with boys, then it'll be better for you.<br>  <br>  I'd wait (:|`|1Lo34oEDaa	no i started dating at the age of 14 and its all good it kinda depends when you feeel comfortable to date <br>  <br>  good luck =)|`|dX4Dll0yaa	No, as long as you don't take it too seriously.|`|rIXqviz7aa	no|`|1E1m0ZOFaa	no! i know 3 year olds that have a boyfriend but that's cute so it may be different.

Hp1rNHduaa	Yeah, I think you need to find someone you have more things in common with or it isn't going to work out<br>  <br>  sorry to be the bearer of bad news|`|sCcGpKXlaa	Be very careful what you knowingly invite into your life.  If you had a child, would you want this person to be around that child.
eGpOIV12aa	ask her if she needs a ride to the fair, that your friends have space in the car.<br>  <br>  the worse thing that could happen is that she will bring a girlfriend along.
YXRRpodKaa	You have a point. I had a lot of trust issues and hate towards men. It came from being molested, almost raped, my father abandoning me, sexual assault and harassment in high school. Yet I still wound up in an abusive relationship. Always being the victim. I didn't know any other way to live with a man then to be stepped on by men. After my ex dumped me randomly. I started dating and met up with a bunch more assholes who tried to take advantage of me and try to rape me. During this time I had a friend who I talked to online about how much these guys screwed me over. He would give his advice and showed that he cared as a friend. I would talk to him about the assholes who were a lot like his close womanizer friends. He said that his friends treat women like crap and are always getting women. So he decided he was going to try to do this. Because being the nice sensitive guy wasn't getting him anywhere. So after one night of us talking about how the nice guys always end up with horrible cheating ***** girlfriends, and the nice girls always end up with abusive, cheating asshole boyfriends. Just laughed about it. After lots of talking we decided to meet up at a book store. We had no real attraction towards each other. He wasn't my "type" or so I thought. Then we met and it was insane. We're still together. I was at the point of turning lesbian and giving up on men all together, and he was at the point of becoming a womanizer and asshole to get women. Then we met and we're still together.<br>  <br>  I wished someone would have grabbed me by my arms and shook me. I was always making mistakes with men, complaining and crying about how much they hurt me and then end up going back. I'm happy I met my boyfriend. A lot of us "victim" women have the good guys in our lives. Often go to them to complain about the assholes. <br>  <br>  His best friends who always have women aren't happy. He use to be so jealous of them for getting all the women they wanted. Just now he realizes how unhappy they are at the end of the day. In and out of relationships because they never work out for them. My boyfriend says he pities them and now is giving them some advice. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FbTGTZfNaa	have you never stopped to think that your giving off those kinda vibes to women because your feeling like that,no man would stand by and let a girl get hit like that,maybe you should take a long hard look at yourself,not all girls are bad and you will find a nice girl but you need to change your attitude towards them first, good luck!
9nDqbYyHaa	lol well you gotta understand that all girls aren't the same and that some are different then others. there are also those caring ones, like me who would be there for the person  forever. You know what, just dont give up, and it can still work out. Whatever you did with the"ignoring the situation thing" was deffinately not a good idea. You should not do that, just take it this way. If i were to see a girl ***** slapping his bf and sending guys after him.. i would go in and try to help. And you being a guy, its just the way they do things. You guys are suppose to be strong, and not jerks. You may think that girls like jerks, but they always tend to leave them at some point, becuase they find out that he/she is cheating on them. They never get no where. The best personality is to just care for what you got, and take advantage of it. Dont change yourself, to become a jerk, if your the sweetest guy in the world  ok. thats just stupid. I know ur a kool guy, i hope yu become the same guy as u werebefore, because  not caring is not attractive lol good luck though :)|`|IsKBxiyzaa	no, you just picked crappy girls. give women another try. be nice, dont abuse girls... its not nice|`|88bDvyiwaa	Gay watch!!!|`|AA10331655	Oh go get your crayons and color........|`|SCiY5JESaa	get a life|`|e304c56bff79ec6d59f96a991c27676aaa	It sounds like you already are a jerk if you watched all that and not only did you not help but it didn't even bother you. Do us women a favor and don't ever date again. You think you are such a nice guy and this is why women turn you down. Maybe they see you for who you really are and are repulsed by it as I am after reading this question.|`|ZTNt9ludaa	If you want to "get over your hatred of women" I suggest you learn to forgive them for not accepting you as you are. I know that sounds rather psychologist like, but the best way I have found to eliminate or get over my own hatred is to forgive the people or group I am angry at for whatever it is they have done.|`|d125c8820b55df941c4fbb7c7416a0ecaa	how can i get over my hatred for men.|`|AeJbSuNNaa	You're an @ss, and I hate you on principle as well. <br>  <br>  You didn't even do anything to help her?

I think its just something they do, he MIGHT want something more but he might not. Talk to him bout it and see if he'd happy with what you guys are leaving it at.|`|MyKyEJUvaa	YES. SOON HE WILL FINGER YOU, THEN LICK YOU AND THEN OUR HAVING THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. SEX. ARE YOU READY TO GET PREGNANT. YOU NEED TO TELL HIM TO STOP, IF NOT YOU WILL GET PREGNANT|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	he's a guy.  even if he doesn't do that, he does want to have sex.|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	It would be a stretch to say that just because he did one thing he wants to have sex. Also, good for you for still being a virgin. Keep up the good work.|`|ExVhN1Uwaa	well all teen guys want to have sex. and they do that when making out and just to show that they are attracted to you. stay a virgin.|`|fSkt7SgDaa	Yes he does. He is doing that most likely to see your reaction to him being close to your private areas. He will eventually move closer and closer.|`|2zKBJkM8aa	Guys always want to have sex.|`|89owZt6Haa	they seem to think its going to excite you.  if you give him go ahead signals, he'll jump all over it.|`|lsfVytmkaa	HES COLD AND HES WARMING HIMSELF UP|`|K7kPSgs4aa	he is most likely to want it yh if your not ready just say|`|cSPxoFe6aa	he wants to|`|6TRc1nKyaa	no.. Guys usually just do that as a way to get closer to you, and a way to be able to touch.. it doesnt mean he wants sex. I had a guy do this to me and i had a skirt on, and nothing ever happened. He may want that, (deep down all guys do) but that doesn't mean thats all he wants.|`|Xv7LZQa6aa	He does want to have sex but was just trying that for a reaction. If you had responded positively it would have ended up with sex. If you'd pushed him away, he would have backed down. He was giving you the choice.|`|76kQpCj6aa	ya sexy
wkuCydzRaa	She sounds a bit fake tbh, if she can only speak out over the internet then maybe she isnt worth it.|`|OcFLwCQWaa	maybe shes not sure if she feels the same way atm?<br>  just keep talking to her, even if its you doing most the talking, or take her to the cinema or something where there isnt much talking involved<br>  <br>  and shes really quiet around you, but texts you and talks to you on msn means that she is quite nervous around you maybe in person so you;ve got to get to know each other better<br>  <br>  shes probs lacking in confidence so didnt want you to give her a peck as she doesnt want things to go to far to soon or something <br>  <br>  all sorts of reasons, but just keep gettin to know each other and i dont think you lost her as you let her know how you feell<br>  <br>  good luck xx

VQcmReqRaa	hey thanks for giving me advice on my problem its time to return the favour.<br>  Well considering you love her so much (I can relate I love my bf so much too) I would just give her some space and then after a little time I suggest you just open up ,Its now or never and you are over 27 so go for it! dont feel so down or depressed just hope for the best.Tell her show her express how much she means to you (remember after the space period time).If it doesnt turn out the way you planned then just cry hurt and get over it.....<br>  This phrase would work good for you<br>  "Theres gonna be a time  when someone will walk into your life and show you why it didnt work out with anyone else before"<br>  <br>  Goodluck!!<br>  and Tell me how it goes|`|3bB98sh4aa	If your over 27 you shouldnt be so stuck on this girl<br>  There are MILLIONS of women out there<br>  Yeah she was special to you but fact is its just not happening<br>  You dont need to waste your time moaning and groaning about her<br>  Do you think shes doing the same thing about you? <br>  Nope!<br>  So dont waste your time doing it either<br>  Hang out with friends dont sit in the house alone<br>  If she just wants to be friends give her some space<br>  You mite even wanna consider stop talking to her becuase talking to her will only make you want something thats not gonna happen<br>  Personaly I think you shouldnt talk to her<br>  Its just gonna be more painful<br>  If you think you can deal with just being her friend then try that out<br>  What you really need to do is go out and have fun<br>  Dont waste your time thinking of her|`|d99c273b914c667daa5ced5ab44c84bcaa	Move on. Its hard but you have to just move forward. Try and keep yourself from being so needy and quick. Thats why she dumped you. <br>  <br>  I had this with a girl before xmas. We werent even going out but I really liked her and she played me about so much that I was depressed that she wouldnt text me back quickly. Now I look back and think what a tool I was for falling for her like that. Once you move on its like a relief. Nobody could pay me anything to go back to that. Please please get out while you can, even just for your health's sake. Trust me it will make you feel like a new man. I found that I enjoyed the single life more after it also. Just needed a reminder of how great the single life is.|`|Sv62SsxXaa	awww. im so sorry. just try to relax, watch some tv and do things to get your mind off of it. dont bug her, let her come to you. and when she does, be really really sweet, but not desperate or pushy sounding. dont even bring up being in a relationship again unless shes hinting at it a lot. if its meant to be it will happen =)|`|UwnXYMI4aa	dude...its just a girl. lol...get another girlfriend you douchebag.
pEccQrcTaa	i dont think the fact of being divorced twiice, or three kids has anything to do with dating. Being divorced doesnt make you a bad person.

VFdC2wPlaa	You probably just forget how much you like him until you see him. That happens to me sometimes too. Sometimes when you haven't seen him for a while you forget what it feels like when you're around him... so you don't think you miss it. It goes away when you see him, because you get all the feelings back. <br>  I'm sure it will go away... if not just try to remember that you do actually like him. <br>  Good luck!!!|`|qp3LY0tRaa	idk how to rly explain this but the same thing happened to me, where u just loose interest, sometimes you feel like your not with anyone. lol its a strange feeling. its kind of unexplainable. If you guys are going out why doesnt he call you? i think it is necessary, call each other its the best way to make that feeling go away. i would understand that u get shy when u call him but its best. I used to feel like that but now i just call to see whats up.|`|DhcQC9DBaa	yea...idk im like that to a degree as well. i wont see my gf for almost a week and in that week i learn to hate her. i wish i would never see her again, but then when i see her i can't get enough of her presence...its weird. i think its just we get used to not being around the person so we dont have a need for them.|`|htxwTAAQaa	You sound like 99% percent of the girls I've met:  Hot 'n' cold.|`|1OQAUQDVaa	i have done that over a guy before! you think that you are over him and then you see him and that spark lights again. some guys just have that charming thing about them. idk why we do it but most girls do. just talk to him and maybe you could reach that step. hope this helps!! =]|`|IpzapGwgaa	I am the same way, but when i get back to school, i fall right back in love, i think it is because that's what it would be like if you had a long distance relationship, maybe.

I'm not saying you don't like him, or have any feelings towards him. You probably like being around him, the company, the friendship or the feeling of being wanted and important. He might feel the same way. When you're younger, and there aren't any restricions to who you are, who you see, which direction you grow, you tend to be relaxed about it or in a hurry to figure it out. Even unaware maybe, of how you feel, or what you need. Just take it easy. Don't feel bad for not feeling something, or not wanting something. You have plenty of time to figure those things out. You'll be glad you gave yourself the space and time.|`|CYLGIL7vaa	sometimes people feel this way. your like this not because you loose interest in him. its because you miss him and its really hard to explain but its a weird feeling. dont worry about it. its really nothing. trust me, ive been through it before. or its because your in love. with your in love, you cant explain a lot of things.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	You're just not really into him as a boyfriend. You're feelings for him seem to be pretty much what someone would feel for a friend. If you were really into him you would think about him all weekend long and then figure out a way to see him. So, listen to your heart on this one. He's just a friend to you.
1E1m0ZOFaa	You are probably trying to tell yourself that you don't need him and that you don't like him, and at a point you could convince yourself it's true. But the moment you see him, all the feelings for him rushes back. That's what i am trying to do now and i have made some improvements in it but i still can't get over him|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	i have this same issue.<br>  so, i dont know,<br>  but glad im not the only one!!|`|85hQ0ARlaa	I am the same way with my boyfriend. We go to different schools and live in different towns and we used to be neighbors. Even though we live like 10 minutes away from each other and I can go see him almost every weekend When I am at school or at home the longer I am away from him the more and more it seems like he is just my Imagination. But when I go and see him i spend like every minute possible with him and when I leave It seems like he is fading. What my advice is is that you should maybe get his number and talk to him every day or so. Then you will stay interested.|`|ronomgTIaa	my ex bf was like that but he had  bipolar disorder.

He's probably scared too... sure hes the dad but ur the one who has to squeeze out the kid so you have more the reason to be scared... but I would remind him, he wanted to have sex with you, and well chances are if you dont get an STD you will get pregnant... sex comes with responsiblity and if hes not willing to be a responsible father then you deserve much better hun... i hope you have a healthy baby|`|nETF5rmJaa	GET AN ABORTION!

Just go up to her, and let people know that they don't have to be afraid to approach her. Sometimes pretty people can be very intimidated. And it might make her feel good to have someone approach her.

fwro8soqaa	Some girls your age are pretty shallow. But you have to ask yourself, do you even want to be with someone who doesn't like you because of the way you look?  I doubt that you would gain more respect with a smaller head. It really doesn't work that way.  Trust me, in a couple years, it'll probably be different.  People mature a ton during this time.  You'll find someone.  For now, just try to enjoy yourself, you're only 18 once!<br>  <br>  Mely's answer is a pretty good example of what i'm talking about.

And, if he doesn't know you exist,I suggest you talk to him. Get to know him. And, set apart yourself from your twin so that he notices YOUU. Just be as chill and calm as you can. He'll probably like how easy going and friendly you will be when you initiate a conversation with him.<br>  <br>  Best of luck. (:|`|0c2jew2xaa	After the advice you gave me then ill help. If your into the guy what you should do is get him to notice you. What you do is get him to give you his # and get to know him more. Once you know him and you think that he's flirting with you what will probably happen is that he'll ask you cause you don't want to see to desperate. But if you think he would say yes then try asking him without being to obvious. Just be kinda random with him.|`|ljPfsv6waa	First try being noticed in a good way,join teams/activities that he's in (but not all !) and try to become friends with him.
Hjwp1yGWaa	No, this suffix must be from same named father to same named son.  Unfortunately Scott has no right to the suffix, although it is a tribute of Scott's love for his father to name his son such but his son will be the 1st. James Jr. is allowed to give his son the suffix of the 3rd, as long as the name is identical from Grandfather to son to grandson.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	James Paul Smith has 2 sons.  Scott and James Paul Smith, Jr.<br>  <br>  Scott has a son  and names his son after his dad James Paul Smith.  This child is James Paul Smith, II  (the Second NOT Jr as it is skipping a generation  from James Paul Smith, Sr.  The son is Jr but when there is no Jr or the parent is not the Jr then the grandson is II aka the Second.  This is the general way that the suffixes work, BUT they don't have to use that formula.  My mother hated the name Junior and she knew if she named my brother after my father his family would call him Junior, so they opted for II instead.)<br>  <br>  This is where it gets confusing.  James Paul Smith, Jr names his child James Paul Smith, III  BUT if James Paul Smith, II has a son who he also names James Paul Smith  that child will also be JPS, III.  So it will be possible to have 2 James Paul Smith, III in the same family but they will be in 2 different generations from 2 different lines.<br>  <br>  Now, if Scott only names his son James with a different middle name, then there is no suffix to add to Scott's son's name.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  I also agree with the first poster that it is bad form and could cause trouble in the family for Scott to use his father's full name for his son as I see the Jr as having more of a right to the name.<br>  <br>  However, I've researched enough family trees to know that people don't always keep things nice and neat and it's not uncommon to find several cousins named after a beloved grandfather.

Biologically, the prime age to give birth is 19 years old. <br>  <br>  Obviously, there is a paradox between what is socially acceptable and what is biologically ideal. Such is the life of being human.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	My parents have 9 kids and and 5 of them were born when my mom was 35+ and all were very healthy with smooth pregnancies.  She was 35, 37, 39, 41, and 43 with my 5 younger brothers and sisters.  She did say that by the last one at age 43 she felt like she better not have anymore as she because the pregnancy and delivery were just too exhausting.  So I'd say between 40 & 45 is when women should think about stopping.|`|uF5Xgtgraa	I would have been in financial ruin if I had had a child in my 20's (I must be the only one with a huge student loan).  Now, in my early 30's I have the hubby, house and $$$ to have a kid.  I figure I still have the better part of a decade to decide when I have a kid.<br>  <br>  Every situation is different.  It is funny though, how to a person in their early 20's thirty seems so old...<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Should I have run out at 22, become a bankrupt single mother and filled my life with stress and worry?

The healthiest time for a woman to have babies were 25 up to 30. By age 31 to 40, it is still healthy but there are difficulties because our bodies not as strong as they use to be. 40 to 45 are risk pregnancy because our bodies are weaker and it is nearly our menopausal stage and the risk of an abnormal child is very great.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Past 45 can be dangerous.

My mom was 38 when she gave birth to me and I don't feel defective : P.<br>  <br>  ADDED (REPLY TO ANSWERERS):<br>  <br>  The idea that babies from mothers who were 19 years old are stronger than babies from mothers in her early 40s is a load of crap.<br>  <br>   It depends on how babies live their life, for example, with the mother so young, the children could probably not have a good education and not have affordable incomes to live healthy lives. They could go to schools where they are influenced into drugs and they defy their parents while the 40-year old's children could live a financially stable lifestyle and lead a healthier life. <br>  <br>  You really can't gaurantee that just because your 19 and you have a child, your child will now be stronger than any older mother's because chances are at age of 19, you'll most likely not give your child the better life that parents will give theirs. <br>  <br>  I'm glad my mom gave birth to me when she was near her 40s because now I'm blessed with her and my dad paying me to go to private schools and able to pay for my attendance in Duke University. Now I'm 19, living with my fiance, and we both plan to stay childless and enjoy our lives until we want to settle down rather then give that all up so soon.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I know 3 women between 40-43 who have given birth to perfectly healthy babies in the past year. There are tests to check that a woman's eggs are still viable, as well as egg screening to screen out defects.

FSruw622aa	I was on the same boat as you that I feel that I should go when I'm dating someone and they are invited to the wedding. BUT I've also heard that it depends on the bride and groom as to who comes and if they can bring someone with them. So I took some time to think about this more and I think my feelings are that I am dating them, they got invited, I should be allowed to go as the date.  I realized that weddings were almost like the same thing as a dance to me.  It's taken me some time, but I've finally realized that it's up to the bride and groom and that's final.  You wouldn't like it if you had a party and someone came that you didn't invite would you?

au1yFfuxaa	He should have at least ran it by you and asked if you were comfortable with it. I would confront him about your feelings and let him know you feel disrespected.|`|xheH9Mj0aa	It is ALWAYS Bros before Hoes, but only when it applies.<br>  <br>  It doesn't really apply here.  The girl was never yours.  <br>  <br>  What he SHOULD have done is talked to you first.  But since you weren't hooking up with the girl, you would have told him it was fine.  It is not cool to hold all girls you like off-limits to your friends, unless you actually did everything you could to go out with her and she blew you off.  Then it's B b4 H.  But B b4 H only really applies to chicks you have dated and are now gone, or chicks you were really screwed up about but would not go out with you even after you asked her out - not girls you liked but never had the balls to go after.
ZQdn9xMPaa	No, they arent going to change back, see teenage girls tend to try very hard to grow up. And unfortunatly theyre not mature enough to truly do that. Your Nana is strict with you because she doesnt want you to be like them...and it worked!!!! You are more mature, they see things as "SO COOL" and you are smart enough to know they are stupid. Be thankful, because in a few years youll be an intelligent woman with all your priorities sorted, they will unfortunatly be still tryin to be grown up. As for your Nana sit down and talk to her, explain that you do your absolute best for her, but you feel that you have earned the right to show youre responsible, dont ask for much, just a bit more freedom. And if you get that freedom, get new, real friends that will be there NO MATTER WHAT. I Know you miss what you and your other friends had, but it seems like youve outgrown them. My point...You are smarter, and when you are older youll realize its BECAUSE you were raised how you are, and you WILL be thankful that she made you a better person.|`|oQlAfg7Taa	Don't worry about those stupid bitchy girls in school. You seem to be much more mature and sensible than they are and in a few years you'll be able to prove that your better than them. Deep down they obviously feel very insecure about themselves if they have to prove how cool they are by smoking and hanging around with boys. Don't be in a hurry to grow up and enjoy your youth. Just concentrate on your <br>  school work and helping your Nana. Smoking is very stupid and in a few years they are going to look much older than you.|`|chlvKoXqaa	now you can see why your nana kept you away from them,<br>   soon you will be grown and can move out but you will move out with a better character than them, everything in life changes, you will meet new people someday, start going to a bible preaching church, it will make things better.|`|Jhr68T0baa	You need to talk to your mum/ nan about your freedom and trusting you as you are maturing and getting older. Explain to your friends how you feel about them and the situation.
6ZidhJgOaa	Boys just talk about girls looks with their mates tbh, just like the 1st person said.<br>  And yeh, i do think he likes you seeing as he sits next to you, stares at you etc.<br>  Maybe you should get a friend to find out who he likes, or ask him who he likes and tell him you like him. <br>  =D good luck|`|zjNidefBaa	Boys say to their friends about girls..<br>  <br>  ''I would f*ck her''|`|673B37CKaa	Sad but alot of the time that's true^ lol
uJ9waJDYaa	I understand, when I was younger my friend told me how much I'd been changing and asking why I had changed, but i hadn't even realized I had.<br>  But when you that young of course you change. Your youth (13-24) is when you change the most because you are developing.<br>  Just ignore what they are telling you and just try still have fun with them without being how you don't want to be. <br>  If you think they will try and change your mind wait a little longer to tell them. Be sure this is really what you are 100% sure you WANT to do before telling people then once you tell them be strong and stand up for yourself and say hey I have thought about this a lot, and this is what I want to do so please don't give me sh*t about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  *hug*|`|RartCwe1aa	if they dont like you for changing yourself for the better are they really true friends?

AXrOrIQ2aa	I think its a love story!<br>  <br>  I think Romeo and Juliet represent the perfect love where everything about the other person is just amazing!<br>  <br>  I think thats why they had to die at the height of there love.. Because if they had carried on they would have gotten used to each other and the love wouldn't be so intense! Maybe passion is a better word but I definately think its a love story :D<br>  <br>  I think Romeo and Juliet is my favourite Shakespeare play *sigh*|`|6zCm65haaa	its a love story its the circumstances they have been put in, they have to overcome so many bumps in order to be together they av to fight for what they beleive in but when the fights over there not left with more fighting there left with love <br>  <br>  well dats wot i fink but then agen my romeo tuk a wrong turning got lost and is 2 stubborn to ask for directions!!!<br>  <br>  anywhere hope i helped lol <br>  <br>  xoxo|`|83y9Vu5oaa	love, because they are so into eachother that they are willing to die to be together|`|PS83gPGoaa	definitely love|`|nIZmE4a2aa	It is ultimately a LOVE story because their love sparks up the rivilary and is the reason for all of the fighting.

V0xSZDBUaa	No there is nothing wrong with your sexuality... I know what you are talking about... Life is not all about sex it okay if you don't have the drive for it... maybe you are just wanting on that special person.. I personality think that sex is a bond that two ppl that love each other should share. Many ppl just go around having sex just because everyone else around them is having it. Sex it stronger and better than that and should be held up high... So don't worry about it at all... The right person will come and take you away...|`|7OuNY2q9aa	maybe your asexual|`|SwyZkNn6aa	Perhaps you're asexual.|`|v0NBi2j8aa	This could be one scenario............could it be that you haven't been completely in love, head over heels for someone, love them with all your heart and soul to reach this sexual desire? <br>  Is there any traumatizing incidents that happened to you in your past? <br>  If it really is bothering you I would talk to a therapist or if you are religious, pray to your higher power for answers and direction. Good luck and God Bless You.|`|jXnpJM0Oaa	I'm no expert, of course, but maybe it's a depression thing?  It could just be a slight case.  Worthwhile checking out though.

BdvGQAqhaa	I wouldn't think he would do that unless he is a complete asshole. If he does that then he is only making it worse for himself for a future lady as then how would that lady know he'd not do the same? If he does and he has done so over internet or done such to harass or degrade you call the police on him and see what can be done.|`|PMwg1hWAaa	Nothing you can do to stop it.  Just be confident in yourself and I'm sure his friends will actually enjoy them.  If you were ugly or he thought his friends might make fun of you because of your body, then he probably won't send them in the first place.  I wouldn't worry about it.  My fiance' left me awhile back and I have plenty of pictures.  I've never had the urge to show them to somebody.

uJ9waJDYaa	Try to back off, and show her your attitude has changed and she might think you aren't as clingy or annoying. Start to talk to other girls and then after two weeks of not talking to her at all just start small talk and see where it goes from there. Each time she tells you to go away then go away for a week or two then try again, because if you try again and again within a small amount of time you will still seem clingy or desperate.<br>  <br>  People say "I love you", "I will never leave you" a lot these days, and you say you are still in school so I assume you are young, and young people say it a lot and it hardly ever lasts a long time. You have your whole life to go so don't just think this one girl is your life, because she is not and I think that was made obvious when she got a new boyfriend a couple days after. That shows she is immature are probably just getting boyfriends for fun not because she loves you or them.<br>  You will nderstand when you are older...maybe|`|a1iam8Zvaa	okay she does not hate YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  im srry but in my last relationship this guy broke up wit me and he thought that i hated him cuz i didnt tlk to him, i was just sad and overhelmed =/ <br>  i bet she is just kinda sad inside and i think she is scared to try to tlk to u again because u might say something mean to her or judge her about her new bf|`|pJZBdpehaa	go listen to slpknot and punch her in the nose LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL|`|mR9ydwz5aa	to start, she is probably a little immature, thats why she told you she would never leave you before her feelings changed. and you're most likely right, she still likes you a little but doesn't want to. just try to ignore her back for a little while, and after a while talk to her again. that should make you guys friends again. because once she misses you, she'll want to be friends again.|`|4Q4dZJHpaa	Act like it doesn't bother you,have a laugh n keep on smilin bro,even if it cuts you to the bone.then just wait for her to realize she made a mistake n that you da man!|`|briRpzL1aa	Let me cue you into something... The opposite of love it not hate.  It is apathy.  Meaning, by the simple act of her hating you means she still likes you...  No doubt there..<br>  <br>  As far as how to handle the situation... Put the biggest smile on your face that you can, and ignore her completely.  If she is playing such petty games with you, then I assure you that she is not right for you...  In a short time, I promise you will find someone who would never play such a petty game with you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I Hope this Helps..|`|N0ZLYx6baa	If you still like her, and want her friendship, you need to tell her.

Show her that you can be responsible and she should ease up a bit. She also might like you wanting to spend some time with her|`|AA11103493	The only way to convince her is through your behaviour between now and then.  You have to prove to her that you're responsible enough.  However, I have to say, I wouldn't let my 15yr old go to a festival for a weekend unsupervised.  I'm not sure it's legal either.|`|b21aaa4186b9fdce6b562bcf22a52cbcaa	There are usually double standards involved with parents about things like this.  Having a mature conversation about it will help.<br>  <br>  If you ask you will probably find she was given the very same freedom you are now requesting when she was your age.<br>  <br>  This will immediately cause the 'but its a lot more dangerous these days' type response.  This is not true.  Tabloid media may well be more prevalent but there were just as many dangers back then.<br>  <br>  The positive thing is that in this day and age you have mobile phones so are able to stay in touch a lot better and as a culture we are more open to discussing sex and drugs openly and appropriately so you can make your own informed choices about the imagined dangers I;m sure she is thinking you're going to indulge in.<br>  <br>  I would advise her to talk to the other parents that have been more excepting to see if they can help reason with her.<br>  <br>  She will have to let go of you at some point in her life and if you are asking her to do this it is usually the right time.<br>  <br>  Is it a camping festival or will you be coming home each night? - if you can come to a compromise about cerfew that might help take the edge off it by showing that you are responsible.|`|2Ol0i5fqaa	Haha well good i'm in Jersey too :P<br>  <br>  Urmm i don't understand why she won't let you go really.

Tell her that you feel that you are mature enough and you wish that she would feel the same way. Improve your behaviour and help around the house more, just reassure her that you are old enough and if she never lets go, you will never have the confidence to go out like that. JUst tell her that all your friends go and you feel left out, im sure no mum wants their kid to be upset. i think your mum just needs reassurance. Good Luck and hope you can go! x

dw440Lylaa	How will you feel when "she" turns out to be a 53 year old hermaphrodite?  <br>  <br>  It's not weird, it's stupid!<br>  <br>  It's the internet!!!

It is no different than online dating.|`|JOankL0eaa	Yeah..like if you ask her out, what will you guys do together, where will you go out? What's  a date going to be like? You can't go anywhere.|`|MMIrGwDAaa	uh ya! U dont even know her u have to c her maybe shes like not wat u expected! It cood even b a guy u nvr know ppl can lie on the web and ud nvr know!|`|ZZcPCoGgaa	Yes.|`|RBcPCirJaa	Yes, It'll be weird!

I am dating a guy over the internet, but I know he's not some creepy old guy. I've talked to all of his family and I know him extremely well. I'm going to be seeing him in person soon.<br>  I wouldn't say it would be weird to ask her out, but think about this; How far are you planning on taking this? And is she worth it? Or do you think there is someone much better out there. Notice that she said she would if she knew you in real life; most likely meaning she doesn't want to date you because she doesn't know you. So if you do ask her out, I wouldn't be so sure that she's going to say yes.<br>  At the same time, I don't know you personally, or her. And you guys may have different opinions on this.<br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  --Rora|`|rqp5jk07aa	gettn 2 kno sumone online actually produces longer relationships then clubs and people who may fake in person,,its a proven fact,BUT dude dont ask her out online do it in person in a romantic way if shes important to,and by romantic i mean romantic to her..some girls dont like the roses and dinner limo type of thing,this falls back into gttng to kno her|`|dsOpQZ4zaa	Hmmmm. It's good that you thought twice about this because people can have very difference personalities on the internet. You know that she's a "she" but is she a "she" for real?

4m9Hewq1aa	You two should definitely date. Love grows from friendship, and you seem to have a exceptionally stable foundation. I believe that you will have one of the most passionate of relationships, for it seems both of you care very deeply for one another. Take a chance, I am sure it will work out perfectly. Both of you have been waiting for this, the result will be extraordinary. Best of luck to you! -Alice|`|uhfFNaaAaa	Wow, amazing..<br>  <br>  You should definitely date her. You like her, she likes you! You would be great together. And don't let your family background discourage you from being with her. <br>  <br>  What I suggest for you to do (my opinion) is catch her before she leaves. Right before she leaves, and tell her how you feel about her. Then kiss her! <br>  <br>  Make it brief but sweet. You will be on her mind the whole time, and she will go even more crazy over you! Believe me, girls like spontaneous things like that!|`|4imPGrR4aa	you know what??<br>  just try it out<br>  i can give you this long *** answer but to make it short<br>  just do it<br>  it seems like there is nothing to think about but instead just react on your emotions<br>  your 19<br>  its not time to be timid and shy<br>  <br>  i was shy<br>  now im not<br>  i think im ok looking<br>  and i use that confidence in me to help get girls<br>  just go for it<br>  it seems like there are many good outcomes and just one bad outcome.|`|Q4D5T5vwaa	first, see if the feeling is mutual. ask her if she feels the same way that you do. if her answer is yes, then go for it. and don't worry about being a virgin. i still am one too and proud. just take it one day at a time. dating her would not be selfish. your personal problems and homelife shouldn't have to get in the way. you can start out as friends first if you don't want to rush into a relationship so fast, and then it can eventually blossom into a wonderful relationship for both of you, i'm sure.|`|QKB02ml1aa	If you both feel strongly for eachother then you should go ahead and date her. I do not think it would be selfish, if she already knows how your family life is and still really wants to date you, that is definitely okay. Maybe her family can even help yours about your dad and everything. You sound like a really nice guy and I don't think you would  destroy her innocence or bring her down or anything.

DcrI9zmkaa	Sounds like you've grown too comfortable and complacent with each other.  It's normal for long-term relationships, but it also spells disaster if something isn't done about it.  <br>  <br>  Try putting some romance & spice back into your lives.  Instead of sitting at home watching a movie, take her out somewhere.  Instead of just fixing dinner, make it special with candles, music, etc..<br>  <br>  It will take some effort, but it'll be worth it if you really love each other.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	then go to a park have a picnic ..orjust play with her in a park... go out and enjoy your selfs .. get to work on it mate  .. a movie is for the old ones ... get a life ..|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	It's really very common.<br>  The majority of all marriages/long-term relationships that end (in divorce etc.) end around the 5 year mark.  Why?  I guess that is the point where you two have pretty much done everything together, that new fresh feeling is long gone, you are both really into the while daily routine of things, every conversation sounds like one you've had before, and it's just getting dull.  See, this is where all of these people who break-up go wrong, because it's just a totally natural stage of every relationship.  From here on you need to get over the 'routine' hump and get into the deeper aspects of the relationship and stop mourning the loss of that really giddy exciting part at the beginning of the relationship.  This is the time where you really just have to let your feelings out and, like I said, get deeper.  It's also the time where you start maybe thinking, "Damn, maybe this person is not the one for me" but don't be fooled by this down time; this hump.  Remember everyone says relationships have their ups and downs, well, this is a down, that's all.  So many people just end it in a down time and forget about all of the up times -- it's really sad.  Few relationships last these days because of this -- they want their fairy tale relationship of all up time, but it's not floating on clouds in reality, it's a roller coaster in reality.  Up down up down up down wwwwooooooaaaa a corner... we're going off the edge... up down up down up down...  So, talk to her about it, let it all out -- now is the time to tell her how you feel etc.  It's awkward, I know, but do it.|`|mEWTWGslaa	Because your lives are so busy at the moment, and your so focused on work, you need to stop and think if this is really worth it. Honestly, it doesn't matter how long you've been together it only matters if the flame is there. Apparently, your relationships flame is still there but small. You need to get creative and think of fun and exciting things to do when your going out, to rekindle the flame.|`|I1XIi8syaa	Well when I was reading this I thought you guys might be in late 30's early 40's...this does not sound like a typical 21 year old relationship...you guys should be having more fun, get out and enjoy life!|`|HAHA2u13aa	Normal,yes.Try a temporary separation,if you still feel this way,break it off.Peace
oS1TBzL6aa	Wow how great is it to be a prettier girl that is sweet, funny, shy but not when it comes to espousing her virtues, and always wears awesome neon shirts and jeans?  I think that if you want real answers you should frame the question to be unbiased.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  A.T. Cunningham
o2NZBZO0aa	It takes 2 to tango!!|`|avpv7u8saa	That's perfectly understandable.<br>  I don't trust my boyfriends Ex either <br>  But if you trust him then let him hang out with her.If he cares about you then he wont do anything and if she tries to do anything he will not let her or tell you|`|81ff98a2b59a7150ffd94a3f4604b9e1aa	Oh, it was so much simpler once upon a time.....<br>  <br>  What does it mean to "date" and to "hang" and so on?  It used to be that you dated different people, but heavy physical contact wasn't necessarily a big part of it, nor was commitment.  Dating different people was fine, not a big deal.  Now, if you asked someone to "go steady" that meant you wanted an exclusive relationship with that person, and if you went steady, NO it wasn't appropriate to go "hang with" your ex-girlfriend.  It's fine to go to a gathering with a lot of different people, but not to make a plan to spend time with the ex.  And typically, it was appropriate to always ask your girlfriend along no matter what you were doing.  <br>  <br>  If he wants to "hang" with his ex-girlfriend, without you, I'd just explain to him that it is in REALLY bad taste to go "hang" with his ex-girlfriend.  And if she is really his ex, she never deserved a birthday present, so what's up with falling for THAT?   And why should he pander to her temper tantrum and give in, when the birthday ploy didn't work?  Why does he think he should pacify her, when any other girl can see she's just being manipulative?  Is he so stupid that he can't recognize manipulation?  Or is he secretly missing her?  It isn't right to reward that kind of manipulation by giving in, even if his desire to avoid conflict led him to agree to it in the first place.  He can always back out saying that he reconsidered the idea, and felt like she was manipulative and therefore not someone he really felt he should spend time with, especially as he has a girlfriend.  You might suggest that to him and see what he thinks.  <br>  <br>  If he still wants to go hang with her, and you are bothered by it, tell him exactly how it makes you feel and ask him to reconsider again.  <br>  Does he value your feelings?  A man that tells a woman what she should or shouldn't feel about a situation is.....not a good boyfriend. <br>  So whatever it is that you feel, think about it ahead of time so you can make your case.   How would you feel if he hung out with her? <br>  Hurt?  Insulted?  Manipulated by the ex-girlfriend who likes the idea of wrangling a date from a boyfriend with a new girlfriend?  Angry that she's getting away with it?  Disappointed that he doesn't have the maturity to realize what he is inviting into your relationship - i.e. conflict, trust issues, etc.  You can ask him what kind of relationship he wants with his ex, and why?   And if he says he is only doing it to keep her from being mad, ask him what makes him think she'll let him off the hook with just one "hang?"  When will it end?  Will he go to her beck and call anytime she creates enough noise and bother, just to get her off his back?  Why is she worth that?  Why are your feelings about it NOT worth MORE than the ex's feelings?  <br>  <br>  I don't consider most relationships at the age of 15 to be lasting.  I do know a small handful of people who have long been married to their high school sweethearts, but they are the exception, not the rule.  So I suggest you have fun with this, find out just how your boyfriend thinks about all this, justifies it, practice saying how you feel, practice figuring out how to be understood better.  I hope it helps, but even if it doesn't (your boyfriend is only 15, after all, and probably has some maturing to do), you'll have great practice for communicating in future relationships.|`|kKRMw19taa	first do your boyfriend know you don't want him hanging with his ex girlfriend if not you need to sit him down and talk to him about your problem you having with him hanging with ex girlfriend and other problem you have with him and her an he do need to understand that problem you need to tell him she need to leave him alone for real i think she is making him talk to her and he don't want you need to demand him to stop talking to her period|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	your 15, it doesn't matter. It's not like your going to marry the boy. If he doesn't respect you enough to make that decision on his own then move on!|`|FgSTHArKaa	you are 15 babes. you will NEVER marry him<br>  i know right now u may think u will but trust me you wont<br>  honestly, focus on getting into college or university first<br>  and let this be your last priority|`|sly7ATJNaa	She obviously still likes your boyfriend and I hope that he can notice that. All he needs to do is tell her to back off, and if he can do that, then it will show that he doesn't care about trying to keep her happy and make sure she keeps liking him so that he will have somebody on the backburner just incase you guys breakup.|`|trxEyVRLaa	That's a bit posessive. You, I mean. EX girlfriend. If he doesn't usually want to hang around with her it's obvious he feels guilty for not buying her nayhting - let him go or he'll find you too posessive and clingy and break up with you. You can't control his life.|`|hbUfRhoxaa	Completly understandable. i hated my boyfriend hanging out with his ex. but its something us girlls have to deal with. or get him back and start hangin out with your ex. as soon as he nos how it feels he wont want to do it.|`|9PaRdlwcaa	Guys sometimes get annoyed when girls act jealous, but when they're jealous, it's 'completely different'. Ask him how he would feel if you were hanging out with your ex. He probably wouldn't like it very much, and that could help him realize your point.
2nc9k9BSaa	I wouldn't say obsessed. But you don't seem like you hang out with your friends very often.<br>  <br>  I would find a balance between friends and the boyfriend. It's not healthy to only hang out with your boyfriend, because then this shows that you are solely dependent on him. You need to show that you have a life that doesn't "revolve" around him, so to speak, so that you stay exciting.|`|DmgArIu7aa	Well, I wouldn't really say that you are obsessed but you should hang out with your friends more or else you will become obsessed with your boyfriend and you can lose him and your friends.|`|OdbEjVflaa	yeah thats solid
lVk3ZSnEaa	i think that privilege is granted once you reach a certain point score.
A8kFnvw1aa	Oh, yeah, he definitely likes you. Especially because he made up a lie to talk to you. I do that when I like a guy so I just have something to say.

Ask him out if you think he's worth it, and get to know him better.

5NKSn79Baa	The only way is to talk to him about it. Find out what gives. He is either shy, or is afraid of commitment. You two should spend some time together, and get comfortable with each other.

Communication, and patience are the key.|`|VbD0kUeuaa	well i have the same problem i get nervous to talk to a girl that i like but what i would do if i were you i would start a conversation with him and just let both of you start to talk more or ask him if he could take you to a movie

IxwmhaoSaa	Talk to him before your feeling develop or he breaks your heart.|`|TieDK667aa	Talk to him about it. you need to be open about how your are feeling. Tell him that you feel like you have to compete with his ex. if he still calls her more than you. maybe you should move on.|`|zI5UFV6yaa	If he doesn't call you maybe you shouldn't be together.
AA10744471	First of all, decide that he will become your sweetheart. After that, believe that you are going to get him, slowly but surely. Then, act on your decision and your belief. That is the only way to make him become your sweetheart. Remember, that it is your attitude, not your aptitude, that will determine your altitude. Since you are already friends, it is easy to subtly move in the direction of what you want. Entice him, albeit very slowly, even with the presence of your lady friend to talk to you more. Your eyes could do wonders in such a way that you are really flirting with him, although there is not much physical movements, but only with your eyes. Be like Cleopatra, that your eyes tell all. He will not know what hit him afterwards when he is already smitten by you. But be subtle, and it would help if you ask the help of your lady friend to suggest something so that you could be more together often, with or without her. To pre-empt her, it is better to ask her help instead of trying to compete with her in getting your male friend's attention. Go for it, and good luck to you.

He Appears to try hard on his appearance.  If that was your average self it seems you have a more casual stance on your appearance.<br>    Looks only matter if the relationship is only about Physical.  You have a natural beauty and if it really bothers you, the way he looks that is, go to the salon and spend 150 getting your hair made up by a professional and learn how to keep it that way.  If you got some highlights and then gave you hair a lot of body it would go a long way.  Then you would have to invest time and money into your dressing.  maybe take him with you. He obviously has a good sense of style.  if you have the financial means though.  But really that's only if it bothers you.  He is your BF though... if his family has the money have him take you shopping.  Tell him you want him to help you pick out an outfit for going out.  Start with one and just add another ever few weeks or once a month.  <br>  But really though don't sweat it.  But I would suggest going shopping with him even if it's just to look.  Have him pick stuff out for you that you don't plan on buying.  He clearly has style and you would both find it fun I'm sure.

I guess that if you want to give him a double whammy just give him guilt trips about it lol. I am not saying this is the correct thing to do, but we all react differently and this is the way you want it. So, be it. Let him know that you thought both of you were okay.

eVYniI9laa	Your time is not running out believe me. You are only 18, you still have a lot of years with women. If you like someone in particular and you have her email address or phone number, than ask her that way. Some times your shyness gets better as you get older. I use to be really shy in high school and i didn't have sex until i was 22. Just try to go out and be more social with both guys and girls. Ask some girls you know about what they look for in a guy, you'll know more about girls that way and maybe that will help with opening up. Maybe you can meet someone who is just as shy as you and you both can learn together. Just take your time, don't rush it, you don't want girls running away from you. Just relax. And definitely read more about women, the more you know about them, the better it will be for you to talk to them. Good luck.|`|q42dPaSWaa	Just be confident and don't try any cheesy chat up lines,it definitely doesn't work.<br>  <br>  I have a mate in the same situation and he isn't a bit worried he just enjoys life and when it happens it happens the key is to make a lady laugh so don't rush and be happy in yourself.<br>  <br>  Definitely go and socialise with people it doesn't necessarily have to be in a pub.<br>  <br>  You know when you have found the right girl, but don't set your heart on staying with the first girl you meet as it often doesn't happen that way.|`|WvbfNV0taa	well you just have to be your self and try not to do any thing stupid and when you go up to the Grail do not be shy like you are right now because if you go up to the Grail and do some thing dumb she might start to laought at you like the frist garl i tryed to go out with .|`|TU5oHbnQaa	Girls like confidence and honesty<br>  It sounds like you don't have much confidence so you could try just talking to a girl.<br>  If it goes well and she seems into you then ask her out, or if at a club ask her to dance.<br>  Who knows how well it could go?<br>  Good luck!|`|Qx2y3N0Oaa	HOLY SHIZZ!! 18?? woooooooww<br>  flirt with a girl you know, <br>  if she acts like she kinda likes you back ask her out. <br>  <br>  things dont just happen you have to make them happen.<br>  <br>  (by the way i've never had a bf either but then again i'm only 13.)|`|ISMColXfaa	Don't be desperate, girls don't like needy guys.<br>  Ask the girls you like out. <br>  That's a starter.|`|zFvy4V43aa	i think a girl wud like u...<br>  hu kno's u might hav a secret crush..<br>  mayb like ur shy...<br>  she might b shy too..<br>  XD|`|aAqB8i8Waa	wow sounds like ur desprete to have sum one!!!<br>  u'll find one on myspace!!<br>  ask for girls numbers and call them!!!|`|cmI9e4u6aa	uur friends were trying to be supportive they didnt lie to you.<br>  and first of all , its best to find a girl you like then finding some randomer off the street (Y)<br>  just start off talking to them casually, see who you like/dislike +& work from there (:|`|CQ3UWBecaa	be your self. keep telling yourself you can do it an go ask her.|`|HLU0jw2Saa	you can just ask random girls you thing they're hot.|`|U6gz8qUcaa	chill, ima give u a couple of tips from my PUA course (Pick Up Artist)<br>  <br>  You say your shy...am i right in thinking that because of that you probably dont hold eye contact very well??<br>  <br>  heres a practise you can do; stand in the middle of a crowded street (well not middle...remain on the pavement) and look every girl that passes you in the eye, eventually that eye contact will be broken either by her, or as she passes do not break eye contact, eventually making eye contact wont be so scary (do this for about 5-10minutes, if you think people are looking at you look your crazy after that, just pick your phone outta your pocket and pretend to dial and just ask the pretend person where they are then leave, they wont know the truth).<br>  <br>  Never!! break eye contact by looking down, it shows a sign of low self esteem, if you have to break eye contact just casually move your gaze to the side.<br>  <br>  stand with your feet parralel to your shoulders as you speak it makes you look more authoritive, try it out in the mirror.<br>  <br>  when a girls speaking to you, lets say she said she just went on holiday, dont respond with "cool, so what u doing this weekend" because you might aswell not have listened at all, respond with something that relates to what she just said i.e. "oh really, where did you go??" base all your questions on what she just said, girls like guys that listen!.|`|XasLRQnXaa	go to parties and meet women there.|`|lMYcTk6Iaa	Maybe you should socialize more?

As strange as it was i started thinking about this girl on my bus. The very next day i got asked out with her! i was so shocked! so of course i was willing to give it a go as that was the only thing i really wanted. I felt really happy with her and was smiling every where i went. i couldnt help it. i was so happy.<br>  <br>  When we broke up i felt so down and then she started goin with my then best freind like two days after! Shortly after her best freind asked me out and i was just not in the mood. A couple of days after that my ex asked me out again and blinded by love is coulnd help my self. She then blew me over like a week after and im actualy glad to see the bak of her. I was heart broken but i knew that its just apart of life. now ive gone a few years and im happy by my self but i wouldnt mind a special person in my life. it doesnt keep me awake at night but maby thats a good thing.<br>  <br>  All im trying to say is that it might cure your pain as i havnt kissed a girl yet, all ive done is a really big hug and she wasnt happy even with that! i used to be shy and all out of self confidence and im still like that but you do have to put it behinde yourself. you have missed what?... 4 years of our life when you could of had a serious relationship?. how many are there to come!
dZGL4NU8aa	You are still ONLY 18! Some people get their first love later on in their 20's, so don't worry about it. Seriously, relationship isn't something to rush on...otherwise you will totally screw it. Let it happen when it happens, BUT just don't sit there and act as though a girl will just magically pop up out of nowhere either, because that just won't happen. YOU have to do something too.<br>  <br>  I personally really dislike it when someone complains about not having a girlfriend or boyfriend, but in the very end he or she NEVER attempted to ask a girl or guy out in the FIRST PLACE! If the first time, they get rejected, then ask someone else who they like and so forth. When in the end if they get rejected by about 20 different girls or something like that, then they truly do have a reason to complain, but don't complain if you never made the effort! Not everything in this world is going to be handed to you. And I bet, if you actually made the attempt of asking at least some girls out or something like that then before you reach the 100th girl, you'll already have a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  First step is to get start knowing some girls and start liking them - try to have a decent conversation with them. Don't expect them to come to you when you never made any attempt to come to them.|`|GmxR7Mo6aa	Do you have many guy friends? Practice being more social around them, it's easier. Then just do the same thing around girls, only add in some flirting. That's a gross simplification but it's the basic idea. <br>  <br>  Your friends didn't lie to you, they just made an assumption that non-shy people make, that you would make a move when that "right" girl turned up.

You sound sooooo lovely, but girls have to be 'approached' - many are simply waiting for you to ask them out.  Remember a lot of girls still believe that is a man's job to ask them out!!!! Even though it's old fashioned girls are still taught to NOT approach men.  Girls are still taught - to wait for a guy to phone, don't phone him, don't seem to keen etc.,  I am dealing with all that right Now.  <br>  <br>  I love a guy & he is not very communicative so I am told - don't call him, don't try to get closer - he doesn't want you & you are too forward if you text, if you email etc.,  <br>  So girls end up giving up!!! <br>  Now that's where YOU come in!!!<br>  <br>  Help us girls out, heres how to start, think of 10 girls that seem ok to you.<br>  write them a note or say it out loud.  "would you like to meet up for a coffee?, do you mind if I take your phone number, so we can maybe go to the cinema sometime?, what's your email address?  <br>  The trick is you must ask 10.<br>  Now, allow for 5 saying 'no thanx, got a boyfriend, a bit busy etc.,  cross off the ones with bf's.  The others, you ask again, next week.<br>  But in the meantime, start inviting them out for coffee the 1st week the 2nd week, maybe ask them to just come for a chat at a cafe or go cinema?  <br>  <br>  Give girls a chance - not escorts.  If girls find out yr into that, you will be shunned & ignored so much more.  Your wife is waiting for you out there, apparently you can't get into heaven until you find her!!!!!|`|AA10010935	Come on  man you're only 18 years old, that's not exactly old!

However, if you're just nervous on what to do in a long-term relationship, then I suggest you go to an adult for help. This doesn't mean you HAVE to talk to your parents. You can talk to a teacher you trust, maybe a coach or counselor that you relate to. Ask them for a little advice.<br>  <br>  All I can say is have fun and take steps at a time - and always make sure you feel comfortable with him.

TCYGbkePaa	If people truly intend to stay married. the D word is never mentioned because it is not an option.<br>  This guy considers it an option just like your friend probably considers marriage counseling an option. <br>  If I were her, I would have a plan for being divorced. like, a way to provide an income, a budget, talk to an attorney to learn my options...Don't forget to find a marriage counselor. Whether divorce happens or not she needs one.<br>  .And when I knew what I could do to take care of myself and children, I would tell him that the year has come and gone and I don't want a divorce. Then ask him how he feels.<br>  I think she should expect the best, be prepared for the worst and stand up for herself and her children.|`|3lxagSP7aa	I know she must be raging mad, I would feel just the same. I know its easier said than done but she decided to forgive him and give it a go and if he has changed, it would only cause a fight, I would tell her not to mention it. people say things when they are angry, to think, how many times I have told my husand I would divorve him. i think she should mention seeing a relationship counsllor as there may be unvented issues that need to be discussed and its better to vent these feelings in a neutral enviroment if they want their relationship to succeed|`|2bhMmlzHaa	If they have kids the person who files first usually comes out the other side of divorce with the better half tell her to beat him to the court house. There are other men at there she won't be alone long.|`|ucVgUcDvaa	Poster A has it right. Leave him, he is a controlling jerk.|`|kEtYEmhqaa	I'd suggest marriage counseling|`|AA10408380	If things are fine now, let it be. But if he brings it up again, a discussion needs to be there. It's his ploy at control. If u don't pleasse me, I'll leave. So she needs him to communicate with her. If counseling needs to be there, it needs to be there, but they need to resolve their issues. OR hey, since things are fine now, and he's a good hubby once again, go to counseling now and try to nip the issue in the bud.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	"What would U do if your hubby has brought up divorce twice?"<br>  <br>  my answer:  get a divorce.<br>  <br>  i shouldn't have to BEG someone to live with me and be with me. i will NOT beg someone to love me--that should come naturally--so if he wants a divorce so bad, give it to him. move on with your life.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  this about your friend (oops), well...give her my advice.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	They should have been talking about it for the entire last year.

He's a maggot toilet licking worm for cheating on her.|`|5SCD87hTaa	first off if during the trial separation the wife slept with another guy any argument on cheating should be mute. they should both move on with the divorce if they can not deal with the other having slept with someone else. now if the wife did not sleep with someone else and she is willing to forgive the husband for doing so it should not be talked about again. they were separated and it happened no amount of nagging or yelling has yet to make something that happened un happen. if she can not forgive him then they should move on. if she can not come to terms with what had happened then all she is going to do is make the marriage worse. the fact that he has talked divorce before makes me believe that they have had problems that have been hard to fix. in fact most times with problems in relationships they can not get fixed only covered up or pushed away. if the events that happened during the separation are just going to add another problem then the relationship will not work. <br>  <br>  when it comes down to it, she has to be able to forgive him and never bring it up again or he will divorce her.

7a9908c7c0672028e9909277215f94ebaa	I agree with Teresa G. Having once worked in a daycare myself, it's not that unusual to see boys that age act that way. Try completely removing yourself from anywhere he's at. If that doesn't work,  talk to the boy.If all else fails, talk to his parents while the boy is with them and let them know his behavior is not acceptable, and will not be tolerated.  Some boys of this age seem to be hormonally "growing up" faster these days I'm sorry to say. Good luck to you.|`|AkBx09UGaa	I think your only hope IS to tell him straight up that his behavior is inappropriate.  If he keeps it up, you'll have to talk to his parents.  I don't see where you have any other choice.  He needs to know his boundaries.   And you have to be firm and consistent in enforcing it.|`|fSkt7SgDaa	Have a one on one talk with his parents about his behavior. Even though it will be embarrassing, it will help.|`|AnjIEVXKaa	talk to your supervisor and let them handle it. if you try to handle it yourself it could end up worse.|`|AA10286415	You need to tell him to stop. Next time he behaves in "that manner"  you must tell him "Stop! I don't like that." This is for his benefit as well as your own. You do not have to yell or make a scene, just be direct. Then tell your boss and his parents. When kids are expressing age inappropriate interest in sex that could be a sign of trouble. And 10 is young to acting in the manner you describe.|`|a2c3K2f6aa	I agree with Travyt12, <br>  tell his parents!(:<br>  if they can't stop his sexist behavior,<br>  the school can.|`|vl8BVZVCaa	How old are you?

And sugar, the later you start dating the better. Relationships are tricky things and it's best you go out with someone because you like them, they're good to you and because you get on well with them. There's no point in feeling under pressure to start dating because of whatever your friends are doing. Redheads aren't given enough creidt! It's a striking colour. And besides, why would you want to o out with someone who likes you only for how you luck? It wouldn'tlast long at all.<br>  You've got a long way to go from here, but all will be good if you do what's best for YOU, and not what others think.<br>  Good luck! x|`|OdvWnBC8aa	First of all thirteen year old boys are usually a little on the immature side!

In the mean time just have fun flirting with boys and keeping your eyes peeled.  If a guy truly likes you, the color of your hair will have nothing to do with it.  Besides I know plenty of guys in their twenties that love red heads!|`|73GkepzFaa	It's nothing to do with you. More what's wrong with "everyone". Dating is nothing to rush into. I didn't have a boyfriend til I was 17. It bothered me a lot being single but now that I'm grown up a bit since high school, I understand it wasn't that big of a deal as I made it out to be.

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Everyone lies, not just women. We tell little lies all the time for different reasons. One is we want to make ourselves look better than we are. We want to impress people. Or sometimes we lie so we won't hurt someones feelings. We lie to get out of things we don't want to do. I have never known a truly honest person. We learn to lie from our parents and we don't see anything wrong with it. We don't think it hurts anyone but it does. <br>  If you really like a woman then work with her and teach her she doesnt have to lie to you. The main problem is we dont have enough confidence in who were are to be completely honest. Convince her she can trust you through your own actions by being honest with her.

But a little time spent with other guys is still ok, but it sounds like they're almost best friends.

And let him know that it bothers me not because I don't trust him, but because I like/love him so much, I want to spend more time with him. In a way, it's also a tad bit disrespectful to you to spend all her time with him. Especially considering how other people are gonna view your relationship.

If they start to hang out more and more- and he starts to become more important than you- then I would worry. But talk to her and express your worried. Tell her how much you love her and how much she means to you. But don't get OVER protective... that never ends well. But in another sense- make sure you also know whats going on. There's a limit to being involved in someones life- but if your concerned, express that to her. Be open with her and she should be open with you.  If everything was meant to be, it will play its self out. Good luck!

6Rru2901aa	Mami, no one can ever be too good for you, and until you don't start believing in yourself no one will ever think you're good enough for them. Self confidence is key. do what you teenagers do these days to flirt with the guy. or just be straight forward and ask him if he likes you. perhaps a pretty way to do it is asking him the same thing you asked us as if you were talking about someone he didn't know. <br>  <br>  This is an example of how to ask him if he likes you, without he knowing that you're talking about him, or probably giving him the hint. Example: Hey, so there's this guy I really like but I don't know if he likes me, what do you guys do to show a girl that you like them?<br>  <br>  Then I guess he'll give his examples, then you ask him "If you didn't know me, would I be someone you'd be interested in!?<br>  <br>  Lol. Just talking about this reminds of when i was in high school. always worked!<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Moe.|`|JgjzcjEsaa	If you think a relationship could develop between you, if he's not gonna make the first move, why don't you.

Wy0lUjP9aa	Well then on Monday you need to go talk to him. A simple "hi" or a smile when you catch him looking at you can make him interested. You can either find out if he is in a relationship or he may ask you out. Start making moves if you have much feelings about him. Don't be afraid, men like a girl with confidence! It will make you more attractive to him. Or he may look at you because he is wondering who you are since you guys never really met before. Don't jump to conclusions just yet.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Yes it can be - he likes you - better to find out now then regret later. You can take the lead and start talking, exchanging nos., etc. Best of luck.|`|98LDN0Quaa	when you notice him looking at you, jst give hima little smile, if he likes you back it'll drive him crazy..and dont be scared to do it.|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	i would talk to him or see if he has a myspace or something and get to know him on that if your too shy|`|eWO2hqbBaa	start asking some random quesions like wht was our lastni8 Homework or did u finish ur homework<br>  <br>  start with smthin smart like hey  u knw the ans for this or smthin like tht dont juss go for time or stupid Q's like those...<br>  GUdluck|`|toTWw4HVaa	Just be like "hey my name is (your name) what urs" Or ask him if he wants to hang out sometime.|`|d99c273b914c667daa5ced5ab44c84bcaa	Ask him out.

JWjq5iaXaa	well there are many ways, one would be doing the nasty, or you can come right out and ask whoever it is out. or sex them up and what not. your choice. i don't judge.
wXaGIPSPaa	Oh sweetie, my heart goes out to you. You are so tired and carrying so much of a load. Its weighing on your shoulders all the way down to the depths of your heart.  <br>  Your man is depressed. He feels like a failure.  He must feel like he cant find a nother job?  He lacks motivation and self esteem.<br>  This affects your relationship and your marriage. <br>  First of all take a nice long warm bubbly bath.  Then you need to sort things out between you.  For ex he needs to carry som eof the load.  You work out a schedule between you.  Be careful its easy to take charge and start making demands. Then you take away his masculinity.  YOu have to learn how to ask in such a way that he says and does what you want?! lol  <br>  I think you do love him but you just dont like what is going on. If he isnt looking for a job he needs to move out until he does.  Its not fair for a wife to carry the whole load.  He needs to be looking for a job or going to school to get marketbable skills.<br>  You take care.   You see a therapist asap so you can get on track.  THis marriage is worth saving. YOu can do this. You will be ok an dyou will come throught it.  <br>  www.marriagebuilders.com|`|z5hrgF45aa	hun u gotta talk with him. if he ignores threaten to leave, i know exactly what u mean here. god only if these men showed some care i guess half of the battle would be sorted|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	let me offer some tips from the husbands side. Recently I was fired from a job that I truly loved.  It hit me hard, very hard. It triggered a depression, the likes I have NEVER before experienced. I could not eat, sleep or hardly move.  I questioned my sanity and whether or not life was worth going on with.  I talked this stuff over with my wife.  with her undying love and encouragement I was able to pull out of that pit of hell called depression and find work and again be a contributing member of the household.  I hope this helps.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	I think you need to tell him that you both need to talk.  If you can, have a relative watch the kids and sit down with him and tell him exactly how you feel.  Try not to threaten him about his situation as that will only lead to something bad.  If you feel that he is not going to try to correct these problems, or it does not appear he is looking for work then it is time to give up and move on with your life.  Good Luck|`|AA11830777	Was he like this before he lost his job? If not, he may be in a slump. Feeling down on himself because he can't provide for his family. He may be taking that out on you. I know when my quit his job and started up his business I was a lil repulsed. He was at home all the time.His new career choice was in nightclub entertainment, I paid for him to go out to bars. He called it networking. I went to work and took care of everything so that he could build his career. He too would leave for hours, I had no idea where he went or how long he would be gone. I couldn't question him, he would be offended. We called it quits shortly after.<br>  Your husband needs a wake up call. He should lucky that he has someone there to take care of his children and home. <br>  If you really want it to work let him know. Don't talk about it and in a few days let him slip back into the usual routine. Marriage counseling may help, if money is tight they have community resources available at lower costs.<br>  Lay it on the line and demand that things change. He needs to try, it must be a team effort. If it still doesn't improve you may want to explore your options without him. Good luck.|`|Ozk6a3Asaa	i believe you need to talk with him or send him a letter<br>   telling him about your feelings  you feel he is not giving you the Support, Passion, respect, admiration, understanding, help, company you and your children deserve, tell him you are a team and you have children and you need a big restoration in your love because if you don't changes the love will died and in the hard times it is the moment to show the reason why you felt in love and revive that seed in you<br>  talk with him with love in your words, be calm, talk with him wise<br>  and if he don't change after that, he don't make de effort run away because woman don't need in her life a man with peter syndrome<br>  we need a man a protective sweet man|`|chENztVEaa	Sounds like you are both going through a big slump since he has become unemployed.  If you lived together three years before the marriage and everything was okay than his lack of a job is probably what is causing all of this.  It will pass and you will get through the bad feelings you are having of him, he's probably doing the same.  Make him get out and look for a job every day until he finds something.  In the mean time make a list of things he needs to do and start giving him a dose of his own medicine. it helps if you ask nicely and say something like, "Can you do this ________, while I do this_______"<br>  this way you will be asking, not telling, and he will probably be more apt to cooperate with the work load. Good luck to you.|`|herwbUsFaa	he might feel like he is a failure he lost his job and no longer is the bread winner i went through the same thing when i lost my job i took me a year to find another one try to talk to him without being critical because he might be depressed|`|AA10890379	i think you should try marriage counseling..that might help, if u love him and wanna make it work, keep trying..if its meant to last it will, if notthen know that you tried your hardest..|`|xNWqqlcYaa	well i guess you getting married and having kids when you really didn't know anything about life didn't work out so well for you huh?|`|57JfZHNdaa	Did your husband prior to losing his job help you wash the kids, cook dinner and do laundry or is it that because he lost his job you want him to split those activities with you? No offense but it sound a bit awful that your husband has lost his job and quite possibly part of his manhood. Have you been encouraging him to get a new job? 3 yrs and 2 kids ago was he lazy? When he leaves and doesn't let you know where he is, is it after you have 'asked' him to help you with something? Maybe you should cut him some slack. You married him 4 months ago and just because he lost his job and is textbook depressed, you belittle him? Did you skip the part about honoring and richer or poorer etc...on you 'big' day?|`|5SCD87hTaa	he is a free loader and you deserve better. but as you know you have more to worry about then just you, you have two children. from doing the math (been together 3 years have two kids and i am guessing the school run was for yourself not the kids) you have two young impressionable kids. at that young age everyone is probably telling you that you need to have a father in your children's lives. in all sense this is true but there is a catch. little kids get attached quickly to anyone that takes care of them ie. from the looks of it this is you. if your husband is emotionally hurting you this will effect your kids. <br>  <br>  What i would recommend will be to take some time apart. i am not talking trial separation or all that other stupid stuff. i am talking go out on a friday night or take a weekend with the girlfriends. with out him having a job i know this can sound like it is not cost effective but a divorce is a lot worse. your frustration with him is probably reciprocated by him also. a little time apart even just a night can make you feel better. tell him he has the kids tonight and call up your girlfriend that you have been wanting to see forever but haven't had the time and do something with her. try to do this at least once a week and your stress should go down. if it doesn't and he does not get a new job soon, you need to leave him. you already have two kids to take care of you do not need a 3rd.|`|D1NhxI2iaa	well I can tell u this I feel for u ..my ex was the very same way ...But maybe u can go to counseling or something to try and get some help ...trust me I know exactly what u are going through and it is a lot stress ..|`|EQ8HCI0Haa	Well, i went thru a similar situation with my husband a while ago after he got laid off from Ford, and it was very devastating, so i did seek a marriage counselor, and talked to him alone, and eventually he advised me to take him out and have a dinner with him and try to communicate and put him in the reality of the situation, i somewhat woke him up, because he was in what we would call a "coma", he got hit hard, and the pressure of the bills, the kid, and me was getting to him, so in the end of the day i didn't want to ruin what we had because of him losing his job, and i know it isn't easy, but if you don't get thru to him, nobody else will and eventually it will cause some serious damage to the marriage.. this is from my own experience, i hope it will help you out one way or another, and i wish you a bright conclusion out of this reality mess that we have been thanks to the devastating economy.|`|d2yvR0Ruaa	This situation is not unusual.<br>  Too much, much to young.<br>  He is still a boy and still growing up.<br>  Maybe his mum should clip him round the ear and educate him about marriage and relationships.<br>  If this fails, buy him a self-help book.|`|72a759eadcb04ef83b501e2c3dcde213aa	sounds like he's in depression - his job must have meant a lot to him.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you to help him try to find a similar job to his old one - it would help boost his esteem and he would appreciate it more.<br>  <br>  laziness is often a symptom of depression; not a habit.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest you to find something you both like to spice up the relationship more so he wouldn't need to just depend on his job to make him happy i.e. put him into depression.<br>  <br>  there is a need for help to get someone out of depression as oppose to get themselves out (which is notoriously difficult).<br>  <br>  hope this help|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	You need to sit him down and tell him calmly that he needs to do more to help you with the children, particularly when he has no task on - like job searching.  He is probably really angry with the way things have turned out just as you are. So be determined and firm with him but do not get angry or insulting. For a breadwinner losing your job is devastating as all self- respect disappears with it but even so he should not just leave you to struggle-on alone. You both need to work on your relationship too, love is not a one way street.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Are you on good terms with his mother or sister ? They may be able to say things to him which from you might sound threatening.<br>  Even if he has a brother, he might listen to someone like that - if you manage to get over how distressed you are at this slob behaviour.|`|641ef355c3ba077004c47f9ce2106922aa	How about you tell him how you feel? It won't help if you both just sit stroppy throughout the evening.|`|cHiv6eTWaa	Too long to read this book.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	The only thing you can do is ask for his help instead of expecting it. If you want him to run the vacuum or do the dishes, or whatever the task is, ask him. You can't get mad at him for not reading your mind. If after you ask he still isn't helping, you will have to decide if you can live like that forever or not, but you can't expect him to change to satisfy you. You can't change other people. You can only change yourself and how you react to other people.  <br>  I don't know if you huff and puff around the house when you think he is being lazy or if you nag, but if you do, that may explain his disappearing act. He doesn't want to deal with you when you're irritated to he bails for a while and comes back when he figures you're done.<br>  If you don't nag or huff and puff, his disappearing may also be a way of getting out of doing work..IDK, you have to ask him why he does that....

2G8lOPN8aa	Just wait it out. It's never cool to break up another person's relationship. If he wanted to be with you...he'd end the relationship and ask you out.  <br>  <br>  If he is still with her...then you are the odd person out, I'm sorry.  <br>  <br>  If he truly does like you...he'll end it on his own terms in his own time without any interference from you.  Wouldn't you rather it go that way anyway?<br>  <br>  Don't get too involved--if you make yourself too available to this guy while he has another girlfriend--he'll figure he can have his cake and eat it too.  Guys always want what they can't have... so I'd remain as unavailable to him as possible. :D|`|yje6VNCpaa	if he has a girlfriend but he likes you, then i'd tell his girlfriend cuz that's just not right.|`|ZQdn9xMPaa	Yeah Im sorry, he might like you, but obviously not as much as he likes her, or he wouldnt be with her. If you dont want to break them up then you have to leave him alone. If you really think he wants to be with you, then leave him alone. If he wants to be with you, hell do what it takes and end it with her. But honestly if he isnt ending it with her, than he probebly wants to have his cake and eat it too. And just in case the girlfriend is your friend, since you seem to care about her, than leave it alone, it is NEVER ok to take a friends man OR date her ex.
oxnHGUaXaa	If you really like her, then why not send a text?  Maybe you just saw someone doing something ridiculous and share it via text.  Something that will make her laugh or smile.  Even something that you noticed on her that you didn't say.  For instance, maybe she had cute freckles on her nose that you can comment on.  You can even give her an update on what you would like to include on your next date, like "hey after the movie, I know this great diner, want to go?".  Anything that shows her you are thinking of her will make a great impression.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Just call her/text her.

She could be charged with assault if you want to get nasty but I dont think we are THERE yet. Time for a new girlfriend. Change the locks when she is gone. Look for someone a little bit more MATURE. Good luck.
hHjPFxEdaa	Just because something is not the norm doesn't mean it's wrong. It's unusual but not unheard of. If you're a true friend you will accept his choice.|`|0F8hauikaa	It's a bit unusual but I wouldn't say abnormal. Perhaps he sees her inner beauty, and that is a real gift. I feel better now that my boyfriend is only ten years younger than me.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	It happens but it's not normal. Sounds more like he is looking for a Mother figure or not to deal with young girls with issues.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	No, that's normal at all and I would say your friend has mother issues.|`|0FwVGYEYaa	how could that be i cant get a man my age ,so i bet i would never get a youngun|`|SaDwYkI4aa	yea its normal.|`|lijNJznEaa	No, it isnt, you f*****g freak!!!!! go and date someone your OWN age, or a LITTLE BIT older than you, you f*****g weirdo!!!!!!! She is old enough to be your f*****g granny, you sick b*****d!!!!!<br>  <br>  sorry, I appear to have over reacted there a little, and had a random fit of tourettes.|`|hbKnTniwaa	Not really..<br>  But there's some kind of love that we can find, wherever, whatever the other person is ! He's maybe surching for this thing, that most of us can't see...|`|qnQi1tonaa	I think it's normal and okay. It's all about the chemistry.|`|oQcDZI9Daa	it's not what you would call "normal" but it does happen.<br>  love is blind and knows no age.|`|lHynYc4Aaa	ya happens everyday<br>  <br>  btw this isnt yahoo india|`|hBiKebSDaa	Sure ... older women have more to offer!  LOL  ;)|`|ZLjeDe7xaa	Nope, not where I come from.|`|YxOWoBZYaa	depending on what u like ? well love is blind|`|g5bXgP7caa	what are you kidding me shes old enough to be your GRANDMOTHER! all my friends say totallly wrong, sorry but in our oppinion it is. but do what you want its not for us its for the best of you. OMG SERIOUSLY 65! DO THE MATHHHHHH. think about it.  but do what your heart says, not what others think.|`|waA0uBXdaa	what's normal anyway?<br>  love is love.<br>  if they love each other, let them be!|`|Jhr68T0baa	Yes.
LbzQtQb9aa	of course its possible....i have 2 of those..they're more like your solemate friends or best frinds of some sort|`|C0xoYXDvaa	sounds like someones got a case of the "treat me like s**t" fetish. lol, just playin wichu. itz very possible. those thingz dont matter as much as raw  animal passion and exitment and a penis like mine alwayz helps.|`|d99c273b914c667daa5ced5ab44c84bcaa	Uhuh. Happens all the time. Dont go out with someone because u think u should like them. U will know when u like a girl. They normally dont like u back which is the problem. U need to make them chase u to have any chance|`|qsbhdi1raa	ha ha yes it is. its hard to explain why you don't like them but you just can't picture yourself going with them. I know the feeling.|`|ab595311acfbfd9b16a828da10437178aa	I used to think no, untill that exact thing happend to me, but i was the person who was funny, cute.... all that crap.|`|yp7reVtyaa	yep|`|98LDN0Quaa	yes...do you not like them because they are less attractive than what your normally use to...|`|rbzoNe12aa	Yep, I've dated a bunch of girls that were nice enough and smart enough and pretty enough, but it just wasn't enough.|`|27af90e0f6dfc8baff90052bd5ee1e76aa	yes. well actually, you probably do like him, just not intimately. i have felt that way, and you guys just need to be friends.|`|f8d7918b4c166ee1c8334e1038182548aa	It is possible.  In order to understand the question better, you would need to explain what "you don't like them" means.  And how they treat you, in what setting.  I mean if you are dating and the other person is treating you well and you like spending time with them, that's one question.  But if you are in the cafeteria line and the other one treats you well, that's totally different.|`|AA11682618	yes it is possible but you must at least tell this person how you really feel instead of leading him or her on|`|AA10266072	Yeah, it's call a friend.|`|UwnXYMI4aa	yeah..those are flaming homos.
b32a7dfdf1f6606efa94f4945a2435d9aa	vergin
7e4jxj3Daa	They're the kind we love to ravish!|`|3jqcLj7Saa	I would think any girl in today's world that's innocent would be wonderful to be around and treat with respect. All you here today is how fast they jump into bed together. Shyness is nothing wrong just respect her and do not push her into a ungrateful situation. Let her be herself and if she feels ok around you then she will start talking to you. Bless her heart for remaining this way. She will truly make some man a good wife one day.|`|nmQZIYutaa	I'm innocent but not so shy. my guy hates shy girls because they hinder the relationship a lot. He says you should have enough confidence in yourself to not be shy. That is just one guys oppinion though. Some guys might go for that.
HUbCcKKbaa	text him with the simple "hey" trust me it works.
BKr3y30maa	A guy being somewhat protective is ok....but having a friend stay with you at all times is ridiculous.  You really need to stop and think about whether you want to always live like this.  If the two of you graduate high school and would end up getting married, he would still be this way.  Doesn't sound like he trusts you.  That's not a good thing.|`|oz5B5q7zaa	He probably just doesn't want to loose you.<br>  Maybe he is in love with you, and really cares.<br>  Or,Jealousy.<br>  Talk TO HIM! Maybe He Has A Reason, Talk to him,|`|Ed9dHSHsaa	Just because he is popular does not mean that he wont be afraid of losing you...he probably does not want to get another girl easilt.<br>  sometimes being protective can be sweet but when it gets over the top then you need to talk to him about it...because if it gets any worse he could end up pushing you away.<br>  you need to let him know if he keeps on like this then the very thing he is trying to avoid could end up hapening. just go easy on him because he probably means well.
2Av3gIqgaa	As one poster said, I don't see a problem in your children choosing some things to place on the registry.  But, I wouldn't overload your registry with things that are obviously for your children.<br>  <br>  I would try to choose items that your children could also use like board games, DVDs, and other things that you could share with your children.  <br>  <br>  Also, since it sounds like you guys have been together for awhile, why not use your registry to purchase NEW stuff, like towels, linens (even for your kids), new cookware, or even a nice new set of china to use when guests come over.  <br>  <br>  You could also try registering for gift cards as well and have your wedding party "spread the word" that you are saving money for the future and that that would be the best gift.  The possibilities are endless.<br>  <br>  I think that you can place whatever you want on your registry, but I would try to avoid making it look like a birthday present list for your children. <br>  <br>  Good luck, enjoy your wedding, and congratulations.|`|AA11380378	No, it's is not appropriate to add children/baby items to a wedding registry. Absolutly NOT appropriate.<br>  <br>  With a small registry, people will likely gift you cash anyway, or register for gift cards of the store so you can use them as you please.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|iKYNUni0aa	i dont think its appropriate to put kid items on the list|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	It used to only be appropriate to put household items like kitchen appliances on your registry, but these days, anything goes!  My fiance and I registered for a lot of the traditional stuff, but we've also registered for a Nintendo Wii, his n' hers iPods, and a really nice pet food storage bin for our bulldog, Manny.  So to answer your question, go ahead and register for whatever you'd like to receive.  Your children are part of your family, and what's a wedding if not the celebration of the creation of a new family?  If things like SpongeBob sheets and kid-safe plastic dinnerware are part of your lifestyle, then they should be a part of your registry too.  If people don't like the items you put on there, then they don't have to buy them. But I can't even count how many items I've bought off of other people's registries that I personally thought were impractical, unnecessary, or just plain hideous.  But it's what they want that matters, and that is undoubtedly the way your guests will feel on the subject too.  Best of luck to you and your little family!|`|cHiv6eTWaa	I don't see a problem with it I guess but some might. Why don't you just have your Brides Maid and Best man spread the word that you don't want gifts at all that you only want cash as gifts then you can spend it how you like. My husband and I did this and it worked out well.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Wedding registries are for wedding related items......baby/children items are for baby showers and birthday parties.<br>  <br>  Kiddie items are not appropriate....good luck.|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	Instead of things specifically for your kids, I'd go with things for the whole family! Board games, new dishes, towels, etc. Stuff that EVERYONE in the house will use!|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	When my husband and I did our registry- we added a few things that we knew my 15 year old daughter would love. When we picked out the kitchen items- we picked ones that we knew she specifically wanted as we didn't care and she loves to cook. I don't know that I'd go putting anything specifically child related on it- but maybe some family oriented sort of items. If you put them on there- chances are that the guests will still buy the other things directed for you and your fiancee anyway. If my friends did it- I don't think I'd be offended, but I wouldn't buy the kids' items.|`|xuiSfzgraa	When my fiance and I registered my daughter went with us.  The woman there said that it would be nice to let her add a few things that she liked on there, as weddings are a "family affair".  I think she ended up only picking out a polka dot blanket that she loved, and a pop corn making machine!  So, I think if you pick stuff out that the whole family can use that it should be fine...|`|5b790b100a69b3691f83c84f59111dcbaa	Doesn't seem like too big of an issue. I mean, most guest rooms only have twin beds any way, and certain colors are good to have on hand. <br>  I agree with the first post, family friendly seems smart, because its not like you don't have a family. let the kids help you chose some items for the house. <br>  If nothing eles, maybe you can do something like a tv and people will do a group gift.|`|9oMXpS05aa	its your wedding, its your day! whatever YOU want to do is what you SHOULD do. <br>  <br>  you're starting a new life as a family, so why shouldn't you put family items on your registry. last i checked, children were a defining characteristic of a family. i say "go for it".|`|R6TFrDtxaa	The idea for gifts is because the couple is starting a life together, you have already started yours ,what would you need????????????????????
Sd3kXRgGaa	He won't look at you.<br>  <br>  When he does, he looks away promptly.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	hehehe well its pretty simple he might only feel comfortable around you and likes to hang to hangout?
2iXecMOYaa	For sure! He wouldn't be pursuing you if he didn't like you. He probably just wasn't able to get to a computer to IM you, or he was just plain nervous. He likes you though... I know he does :)|`|ox5wMQXraa	Maybe. I don't know him so I wouldn't really know. Sounds like he may have or maybe he just wanted to get to know you as a friend. And he may have been busy not to IM you. Good Luck.
bXF1gDTcaa	naw, all sorts of haircuts work for everyone. we're all different.|`|0dO3z3XKaa	Of course not!  So all women should have long hair? How boring is that.<br>  <br>  Find a hairstyle that flatters your lifestyle and face shape.  There are some gorgeous women with short hair. I'm surprised you would even ask this question in this day and age.<br>  <br>  Rock that short hair until you grow it out.  Be proud, I'm sure you look just fine.|`|55b60b3a3d24fb911ae382f06f0edc95aa	I am a guy, and I do like long hair.  Long hair is just feminine and attractive to me.|`|OP8sRCbTaa	It all depends on the guy and their personal preference.  I have very long hair, and most of my guy friends tell me I should cut it.  Having short hair definitely does not make you any less attractive. =)|`|Va96He2Saa	im a boy, i can answer this.<br>  <br>  girls with short hair are definatly less attractive|`|vkDKUCOZaa	Yes sorry!!!!!!! boys/men like long hair|`|ff4Eqytxaa	Ya Longer hair i better than short by a long shot
hZ3PBybXaa	Give it a chance.<br>  <br>  I'd ask him if the two of you should go on a date or two and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you click, sometimes you don't.|`|bg86ji6naa	Do him rough and tuff. Bag him and tag him. Bang him and hang him. Know him and blow him. Follow it then swallow it. Hump it then dump it. bend down and show the brown. Pink it and stink it. taint it then stain it. its not complex just have some sex. dont be a blargage throw away your garbage.|`|SaDwYkI4aa	tell him you MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE when he figures out wat he wants.|`|vlCWp7sSaa	Well, to be honest you can't "think love" you have to "feel love". There's a big difference. With my personality, I would say "Do you change your mind often?" sarcastically. You can always wait and see what happens, but I wouldn't stress over it. Because if he decides to go out with you and "change his mind," that can be very heartbreaking.|`|sZ0McynSaa	I would just be up front and honest, life is too short to play waiting games.|`|0GeqYgw7aa	you should probably tell him how you feel...communication is a key factor in deciding what you want|`|ynZKX4Nxaa	that happened to my boyfriend and i... we ended up taking a break... we still love each other but wasn't sure if it was a bf/gf kind of love... our time apart was rough, but we both realized that all we needed was that alone time... we've been together ever since... almost 3 years now...<br>  <br>  not sure if it'll work for you guys, but thought i'd share... hope everything goes well for you... :)|`|36Yr7cOLaa	I think you should go for it because life is short and you will regret it in the long run if you don't. I had the same thing happen to me and I did nothing ABOUT it and now regret it!|`|6gshK9A1aa	see what happens. see if you are both on the same page, go on a date as not-friends but if it doesnt work out dont worry, just be friends again.|`|O96ikjNgaa	just talk to him and see where his heart is and once u see where it's at just tell him your feeling but you should know when it's the right time|`|Xwb0mX3Yaa	see whats gonna happen|`|IEDVBX4aaa	come on to him. if he feels that way you will have the best god damn night of ur life|`|e7KoyoWsaa	that's not a fair thing for him to say.

1OkyddmPaa	maybe they are calling you gay because you dont hit on them?<br>  haha im not sure<br>  when girls pick on boys its typically because they like them<br>  girls would never kick someone they truly didnt like<br>  hit on them<br>  just do it, they already kick you in hte shins wat have you got to lose?<br>  who knows<br>  maybe they like you too
AA10787626	Talk to her a lot, be nice..become friends. Just subtly (not too fast!) drop hints! After you have become pretty good friends be like "so who do you like?" casually. Hopefully it goes well. If not, I'm sorry! that definitely sucks....but there are tons of fish in the sea...keep your options open. In the mean-time C.O.M.M.U.N.I.C.A.T.E!!!

GChWTGNiaa	My first kiss was a few years ago. It's scary as hell, and there's nothing "magical" about it. But my now ex-girlfriend still says that I was the best kisser she ever..kissed, so I guess it's a natural thing. If you got the ability, good for you. If you don't, too bad. Just go with it.|`|KXHOOe90aa	I used to say no to the dares the whole time, but when i had an older boyfriend it just kind of clicked into place. There are lots of kisses you can do like french kiss, peck on the cheeks, snogging, or tongues. Although, i've never got the hang of tongues. When you go to kiss your boyfriend (bf), place your lips on his, and move your head about, but not to much, when you move your head around, make sure to keep on taking your lips off his, and putting them back on again. It's quite hard to explain. Good Luck x and remember don't be scared if your boyfriend really does love/like you then i'm sure that they good give you tips and hints.|`|gy2S2ENOaa	Okay.  There is no step-by-step procedure of learning how to kiss a guy.  All you need to do is just go with the flow.  I know that this sounds stupid and non-helpful, but once he starts you should just continue.  Bring it up somehow.  You could just be like "have you ever kissed a girl?" and if he says yes or no be like "I've  never kissed a guy before" and then he will kno that when you guys kiss that if u are really bad itsbecause of your first time.  <br>  <br>  If you don't find my information helpful, you could always search the web.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Kiss-a-Boy" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Kiss-a-Boy</a><br>  <br>  the link above is a good sight, and if that is still not enough, you could always go on youtube and type in something like "How to kiss a boy" or "Me kissing my boyfriend" or something.  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!!<br>  <br>  <3 and have fun no matter what happens!|`|v9Zv9aGzaa	with your lips duh|`|lwKz0iDJaa	Offer to teach each other? make out with ur friend ;p|`|pFlkWQySaa	When you kiss your relatives, you pucker up.<br>  When you kiss a boyfriend, you keep your mouth relaxed, and closed.<br>  Later, when you feel up to it, open your mouth and touch tongues.|`|22hX0vDNaa	like seriously I got my first kiss yesterday and you just go with the flow. like I still have no clue how to kiss. it just happens.|`|UPN3zqq6aa	haha omg wat dirty boys ;] ^^^ lmao XD<br>  <br>  go the oppostie way to wat he does and just move yur lips its hard to explain but still hop this has kinda helped =]<br>  <br>  x|`|8th9KY1haa	With your lips|`|zWo03iLNaa	You will be suprised, it will just come really naturally.

T02BJJGjaa	Everything you wrote about this relatives behavior nails that fact that you say he or she is an alcoholic for certain.    I suggest that if you truly love this relative you and those closely associated with this person will seek the help of an Al Anon group so you can more clearly understand how to deal with the alcoholic.   Warning everyone that will be attending your function isn't necessary.   They will draw their own conclusions and if they address the issue to you just explain that you are aware that your relative has some problems and you're seeking help to know how to deal with it.  You are not responsible for this persons actions when drinking and his or her actions should have no reflection on you personally unless you let them.|`|oojO4WAraa	Not inviting them IS an option.  Do a pre-emptive strike by going to this person and telling them you are NOT inviting them to your function due to their previous behavior.  There is a limit to what you should put up with - this person has exceeded that limit.  Take control and go to the person and tell them they are NOT to show up at the function under any circumstances.  It IS an option.  They have earned this treatment.<br>  <br>  My brother was a falling-down-drunk kind of alcoholic and got drunk and made a scene at every function he attended.  I know NOT INVITING THEM IS AN OPTION.  It worked for me.  Of course, it hurt his feelings, but that was his own fault.|`|LbJqU82waa	this person needs an internention and needs A.A HELP TO COME TO GRIPS WITH ILLNESS! alcoholics are famous for trying to get attention in negative ways! i know! because i am alcoholic and am now sober 8 years!!  this person needs to be confronted and not coddled! denial is major problem of people associated with people with drinking problem!  this person has depression and drinking aggravates drinking because alcohol is a depressant!  i had to go through the dt's and almost die before admitting i had problem, but now live by the 12 steps of a.a! and try to help  others learn: you do not need alcohol to have a good life! and need to learn how to live without it! good luck!! suggest that person got to detox and get A.A HELP!|`|YFvXRutJaa	your answer to an alcoholic is there is no luck. he/she is one of your close relative that even make it worse. your best luck is to lecture them and hope the best will come out at the end. you are right advise the people and hope they will understand them.|`|GmF4iAFXaa	Don't let them drink before the party. Try staying out of their way. Everyone should be in little groups instead of everyone focusing on just one person. So when they get to your group go to another.|`|34550d5f2dff52eadb5794f5944a6de1aa	I really sympathize with you.  But this persons problem is exactly that, their problem.  If you let them get away with it again and again, then you are basically saying loud and clear, its okay for you to embarrass me, and yourself in front of guests.  My motto is, if they cant behave, then they must be treated accordingly.  Tell this person, that due to their drinking problem and scenes that they cause, you wont be inviting them to your party.  Every other family member should do the same.  Something must prompt this person, to get help, and start taking responsibility for themselves.  Its hard, but it works. I wish you lots of luck with this one.
Uj5kuzoJaa	At least they are both trying to be there for you and not trying to make you choose between the two of them. That's very grown up of them. Now it will be a little awkward, but try to smooth things over with them at the party. Bring up fun memories you all had together and just be happy. Eventually they'll get over themselves.|`|eQ4EfYZ0aa	Just go up to them and be like okay i am going to invite both of you but if you cause any drama or don't think you can handle it, don't bother to come. you guys are my best friends but i don't wont you guys fighting the whole time|`|tTCOo47iaa	Tell ashley to say sorry its the best way make them sit down and talk we had this problem last year! My friends did not it a long it was badd so they came to my house and i made them sit down and talk it all worked out becuase i told them i am going to find new friends if they dont stop so!!!:) hoped i helped|`|yze7e7CJaa	Its your birthday invite who you want.<br>  its your choice not theirs. they dont have to talk to each other. Ashleys being childish|`|pEztJVlbaa	i agree with purple haze..<br>  woo<br>  lol<br>  ...|`|AA11413831	first of all, it depends on how old you are. <br>  For example, if you're in middle school, there is going to be drama at your birthday and at school regardless of who you invite.<br>  <br>  If you're a little older, like a junior or senior in high school, you should just tell your friends to get over themselves because your birthday is about you.<br>  <br>  Dont let them force you to choose one or the other. with friends, its all or nothing.|`|Jhr68T0baa	Awkward or not you are thier friend and you and your birthday comes first and before all the bitchy bull s h i t between them. Explain how uncomfortable you are and try and help them become friends. But the ashley girl sounds like shes jealous or a bad friend. why else would she spread rumours or tell everyone her so called friends business.|`|g5bXgP7caa	well, in life this happens people tend to walk away. everything happens for a reason and you can't really do anything about it, its between them not you, if it was meant to be then it will all work out. some  people cant stand each other after they really get to know one another. try this for your birthday;<br>  1. leave em alone and tell them to work it out for your sake as in a birthday present maybe i dunno.|`|e06APKVqaa	wow you just got to wait til they grow up they will get over it though and dont get in the middle of it at all if ashley comes to you talking about tonya dont say anything same vice versa because they're both gone want you as there bestfriend without the other|`|8D7T43bKaa	have them both go and tell them to get the F**K over it|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	make them both come, find something in common that they have to talk about, without them realizing it they might start to like each other again, or make sure another person is there so just in case they don't get along you can hang out with one of them and the other can hang out more with the other person

He was definitely like part of me. I'm not sure if I believe in soul mates, but there are definitely people who fit us and help to 'complete' us in some way...<br>  <br>  you're very lucky. I hope it works out well.|`|QlvcSgn0aa	soul mate? didnt think there was such a thing. there are billions of girls out there why settle on just one?|`|2nc9k9BSaa	I wouldn't say soul mate. More like the guy that's right for me. I mean, right now, I'm considering whether I truly love him or not. It's a big step if I really do. And well, I enjoy his company and we are taking things slow.<br>  <br>  Of course, this doesn't mean that my professors make fun of me sometimes and say we'll get married one day. I mean, who knows right? ^^;
6661b8da17d2a54e6d2bd4d96c492adcaa	Okay, Well it's not that she's avoiding you.<br>  She's just shy. Of course she's going to be more outgoing around her friends, because she feels more comfortable and she has people to back up that spunky personality.<br>  Obviously she has something for you, if she's hestitant to speak to you when she's by herself. If she didn't, she would have no problem speaking to you one on one. But, that's just my opinion.<br>  I would talk to herrr, and initiate a conversation without being "cocky."<br>  Make her feel comfortable about herself, and I'm sure she'll open up to you.<br>  Best of luckk.<br>  (:|`|sgfGvjs0aa	yes sometimes girls avoid that they like, i would know because i made that mistake before (but now i'm with the guy that i avoided in the first place) :) hang around her but not in a stalkerish way. try to strike up a conversation, over time she'll be more comfortable around you and just observe her behavior.|`|3SUjApfSaa	Ha im afraid i do this a lot too. Just make her comfortable around you shes unsure aboout how you feel she likes you but doesnt know if you like her so she doesnt want too risk anything or risk embarres herself shes not shy just scared of doing anything about the fact she likes you!Email if you need any more helps!<br>  HOPE thtisssssHELPSsss<br>  <br>  Xx x          x                                             x                                       x|`|UpYPnXexaa	me, personally i would not. but im really not all that shy. but, yes some girls do, because they dont really know what to say or maybe they get nervous. <br>  if shes so shy, you can get her by being sweet. but not like too sweet you know. just start off by being friends and then work your way up to more. good things come to those who wait. =)|`|EaCkHmFPaa	NO DONT AVOID HER.<br>   <br>   silly.<br>  <br>  Go by her at lik eevery chance!<br>   Make yourself noticed,<br>  in a good way!|`|ySpHcjNkaa	Yeah, some girls actually do that. I've had a girl do that to me before, she was just so shy, so every time I tried to approach her, she'd go to another direction. She does that because she's scared she might embarrass herself in front of you or something.
lnkOwDvmaa	I'm shy and I almost every time avoid the guys I like. I know it's stupid... but sometimes I just feel like "OMG what do I do? Do I say hi?"" so I just bail. Sometimes  when I think the guy is out of my league, or I think he's a player and he's just going to hurt me. There could be a lot of reasons, but shy girls often avoid guys they like.<br>   You can start saying hi to her when you cross paths, you can ask her for some kind of favor, information or question and pretend you don't know the answer. Find out where she hangs out with her friends, take a few buddies, go there and "accidentally" meet her....|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Probably. She might not know what to do when you approach, so she gets the instinct to avoid you.<br>  <br>  Or, she might not like you as much as you think. It honestly depends on her personality and herself as a person.<br>  <br>  Why don't you ask her directly if she has any feelings towards you? And then if she does, and if you feel the same way, take it from there.|`|c001644d28860bee4adb248a61e06f21aa	I am shy around my crush but I wouldn't avoid him. I would CHERISH walking alone in the hallway to see him! I would say "hi [name]" even if im nervous.<br>  <br>  But probably that girl is major shy and doesn't know what to do and doesn't want to embarass herself, so thats why she avoided you.|`|pyPIiTBbaa	the reason some girls avoid guys when they like i is bc normally we mess up. we get nervous so we avoid our crushes and we also feel sorta safe with our friends|`|r6rcCTKHaa	shes probably just really shy. <br>  that sounds like something i would do haha (and im the same age, im outgoing around my friends, shy when not).<br>  talk to her and try to get her to open up to you
bXF1gDTcaa	let him be happy with someone there|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	You already let him go hun! <br>  <br>  There will always be other guys. I know it's hard to hear, but you know it's true.
AA11493831	If it's just regular kissing, you can either try a close puckered up lip like a smack or it can be slightly open. It's slightly open, but it's still a regular kiss. Try it, my boyfriend and I usually do it.|`|FLPRFTccaa	his mouth is meant to be as wide as poss|`|VXRORMsfaa	It doesn't really matter, they can be closed or open.  A closed mouth kiss is like the kind you give your mom or grandma..so it depends on how long you want the kiss to last. If its only like a one second kiss then i'd go with closed mouth, but if it lasts for a few seconds go with open mouth. But only open your mouth a little bit, just make sure your lips are apart...you don't want to look like your trying to eat her! ;)|`|X5Fq3mOraa	Just kissing, i suppose it could go either way, I myself prefer making out to just kissing.
keX0rz1oaa	All depends everyone has their own beliefs on when to have sex. Some say whatever when it happens it happens. Others say wait till you're married to have sex. Kids around 15 and 16 usually get into the more dating situation than kids under age.. cause in my oppinion you dont start realizing feelings untill around that age. but dating isnt a bad thing to do at any age its what comes of it, you don't have to have sex, sex should be done when you feel comfortable enough with someone and you both want it and it should just come naturally. Don't force yourself to have sex or whatever you dont want to do.|`|th45yP4Xaa	You should start to date about 16 and i think you should wait to have sex when your 17 or 18|`|v9Zv9aGzaa	whenever you want to|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	They are two completely different things. You can date when it feels right, which it didn't for me until I was a 'real' teenager. <br>  <br>  As for having sex...I was half drunk when I first had sex, and I regret it to this day. I don't even know if we used protection or not! This was last Fall, and I was lucky enough not to become pregnant. Call me stupid, but I have learned...never again, until I'm married! I pray God will forgive me.<br>  <br>  Waiting until marriage can be a great thing. I would certainly advise you to wait until you've been with a person a long time. Whatever you consider the right amount of time for YOU, nobody else.|`|CYLGIL7vaa	people usually start dating when they get into middle school. but not serious relationships. i think that people should start dating when they are either 14 or 15. when you get to 15, thats when it can get a little serious. and sex.......well...maybe like 18 or when you are married.|`|gXRz3U7Vaa	dating- 16ish when you are more mature and the relationship might actually have some meaning.<br>  <br>  sex-when you're married if you have values like that.. or when you're about 18 and your parents wouldnt kill you if you got prego.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	well my parents told me i shouldnt date until im 16. and as much as i HATED them for sayin it and always wanted to go against their back, im probably gonna do the exact thing for my kids.. cuz i dont htink you really understand love before that age, and plus it makes you know WHAT YOU REALLY want in boys and get to know yourself...<br>  and for sex,, i think when ur young, sex means nothin.. its just somethin society does and expects you to do.. im not sayin that you NEED to wait till marriage, cuz its up to you,,, but im still puttin sex off until i find a great guy and think WHY NOT!?!<br>  hope it helped|`|TKNQWdVwaa	well i think it varies from person to person. people definitely have their own different times. <br>  you cant take a specific time and be right on schedule... <br>  do what feels right if you really like the guy/girl|`|3NdBYdlOaa	I think a good age to start dating is probably 14 or 15 and to have sex,I am counting on abstenience,and you should too,at least till your married|`|24aa8ef00e60cd021ba919036bf14330aa	In my opinion a good age to date is 18 and over and a good age for sex is when u are married|`|7cyqgJQnaa	good age to start dating is round 14 and good age to start having sex is lik 18, but most dont wait that long|`|RdMpPhhPaa	dating shoukd start at about 11 :) thats when i started dating :P<br>  nd sex around 15-16|`|e1J4yrO2aa	well i think 16 is good but my 1st was like 6th grade... so it just depends if you want one <br>  <br>   but wait to have sex until your married|`|M6PsYn56aa	When ever your ready most people i know lost it at 13|`|UywxrfGdaa	sex isnt an age thing. sex is about love and trust. you should know sum 1 properly before you commit. and dont be letting friends push or pressure you into thinking you must lose your viginity and that you are an idiot for waiting for that right person. love and sex go together. dating should be an enjoyable and fun with no pressures. dont wish your life away wanting to be older and experience everything in life at once. enjoy being young and having your mother look after you. your mom wants the very best for you and even though she is an adult she was once your age and will know how hard and confusing life is when you are young and how easy it is to make mistakes that can affect you your whole life. take care and always trust in your mother even when her decissions seem unfair.|`|IAIBzgOgaa	when you;re ready, 20or so?|`|RmQzb0Avaa	wait till marrige<br>  you will share ur first moments with him and stay with him forever..b/c theirs no chance hes leaving you|`|WK8MZlLdaa	date when u are about 16,17<br>  <br>  sex....well thats personal and it varies depending on ur values|`|x7uYAPaSaa	When your ready.

Mom knows you and your maturity level and should have a good idea of what you can or can't handle.  Dating can be a serious thing, and well if you're thinking about sex and not even dating yet then my guess is that mom needs to keep an eye on you.  You should really know and trust a person before you have sex.  I personally believe that you should wait till you are in a very serious and committed relationship and can support yourself before you have sex because of the possible consequences.  Just my .02 cent though.|`|Mqg5jQMUaa	Well I think that 16 is a good age to start dating and maybe like 17 or 18 before you have sex, but when you do decide to do it make sure its the right person that you are doing it with........|`|K70AncTNaa	best age for sex is when your married.<br>  <br>  idk about dating though..like 15/16.|`|NROtjfFSaa	Theres no age.

6tcXKcBgaa	Let him say hi to you. <br>  I don't know but for some reason you seem as if you are not allowed to have boyfriends, that is perhaps why you are afraid to say hello to him. <br>  I suggest getting over him. If it was meant to be it will happen. Do not force anything. Smile see what his reaction is.
4BhwLOjIaa	Ask him out and I mean Josh to talk to him in person! And I don't mean your friend but you talk to him your self!you guys need to sit down amd have a serious talk!And you need to tell him already how you feel and stop holding back!You don't tell him he will never ever know how you feel!If you don't tell him you will regret this later in you life!Trust me I know! So go for it!
NxsUEHoYaa	ok, she probably was telling the truth when she was confused about the kind of liking the other guy and her life being complicated....and since she went on talking to you normally she was still feeling that way about not going out with you....but now that she is acting more flirty there is a really good chance she cleared things up in her life and now wants you more then a friend but is unsure if you still feel that way and dont want to ask you if the offer to go out with you is still up for grabs....i think you should ask her again and see what happens...she prob just didnt know how to accept to it this much later<br>  good luck!|`|G1UpP8tWaa	I'd ask her to clarify it a bit more, maybe give her a bit of time before you bring up the subject again:)|`|DjuTSbeqaa	Ask her to clarify her feelings; they could have changed.|`|N2PxYfAkaa	i would say move on. if she likes you she'll come around and mention it.|`|iJVhyOUeaa	Do you want to make money doing free offer and surveys at home?<br>  Super easy! <a href="http://zap.to/money" rel="nofollow">http://zap.to/money</a>|`|aC9dBaNqaa	sounds like you should let her come around you said that she is the shy type and not only that her relationship status is complicated so it sounds like she needs to get to know you and once she is comfortable with you she will open up more but you shouldn't get to wrapped up in her until she is a single lady
DTGZJ8T6aa	oh wow, i'm going through almost the same situation. there was this guy I liked and we were talking/flirting a lot and my school dance was on friday but the days before he started being a lot more 'friendish' and i was like huh maybs he doesn't like me so I used the dance as a test, and he didn't ask me to dance at all and turns out he just likes me as a friend. hah sorry for dumping my problem, but I'm pretty sure he doesn't like you, idk why he'd do such a turn around like that but if a guy is deliberately ignoring you he's just not that into you.<br>  <br>  your/my gameplan: just act like nothing's happened, and shift from flirty-i-like-you mode to friend mode. but you have to keep telling yourself you're the hottest thing out there and be confident around him, not like you are desperately in love with him but like it's his loss he wasn't into you.|`|sJTPzFdlaa	Ask him what the hell happened.

Btw good plan.|`|N569Vpyuaa	well i would say you don't have to say your in her class but the rest sounds good!<br>  be sure to take a hint<br>  one last thing when and if you go out with her don't talk about gross or weird stuff!!!!|`|K3XJ4S0Eaa	that sounds gay, say sumin like hi wanna chill or hang sometime?|`|oOD3dYaNaa	Yeah! That sounds like a great idea! =] <br>  <br>  My reaction to that would probably be surprised at first, and then happy that someone took the time out to know me. It's a win-win situation! =]
4c376969a4eb7f4374a960b4fcf8b881aa	both girls are pretty.... just different looks to them.. 1st one i would say is a "general" kind of pretty, girl next door kind of thing... 2nd one is a more exotic look to her... a little more "interesting" look... so both i guess. just some prefer the 1st one probably because of the "general girl next door" ... me personal i like the exotic and intersting look of the 2nd..but hey, thats just my opinion|`|olFSzqPtaa	definately the first one! the second one just looks terrible.|`|RA8tEvTIaa	1st...... natural|`|MTPoGd1qaa	First but you are too! - you are second!|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	1st...natural|`|qvZopDzCaa	The first girl, she is much more natural|`|uVL1kJr4aa	the 1st chic, she's more natural and cute|`|FLPRFTccaa	can i have the first ones mob number pls. thx.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Number 1 is the pretty one|`|B7idbFNVaa	The first one is more prettier.. she has the sweet girl NEXT DOOR LOOKS and her figure is RIGHT for her AGE.|`|PrpLmZoRaa	in my opinion, the first one is prettier because she looks more feminine...the second one looks like she wants to rip my head off|`|XasLRQnXaa	1st|`|52cHMjiTaa	The first one...You are lame|`|JNY4BEASaa	there both really pretty but i would go with the 1st one

bXF1gDTcaa	get rid of it? dont be shady. its his business. have some respect.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	BURN them.  Any honest and good person would burn them but then not everyone is a good person.|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	If he had a video of you doing that, what would you want him to do with it? Just think about that before you do anything silly, sweetie.|`|AA11011446	If you broke up cos he cheated on you or did something that upset you etc, post them on youporn or redtube with his name clearly in the description for a bit of revenge lol!  If you don't wanna keep them though, just open up the video and cut up the tape inside then chuck them in the bin or ask him if he wants them returned.|`|PfmXPbFpaa	This video was personal and meant to be shared with only you.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep them, you can - being a gift, it might mean something to you to keep.<br>  <br>  If you do not want to keep them, then I would dispose of them so that no one can get them.|`|iqku0QOQaa	don't put them on the internet or send them to anyone if that's what you're thinking of doing. that's real low.<br>  delete them x|`|3zYfwLmGaa	Nun its a private thing u dig|`|nmQZIYutaa	Think about what you would want him to do if he had a video of you doing things like that. I think you should be the bigger person and delete or get rid of the video. No matter what the break up was about you always want to be the maturer person. Plus karma can be a b i t c h and you would not want that coming back on you in a future date. I hope you do the right thing please.|`|n4AnbFASaa	There are several things you could do with the video, you could show it to everybody if you were mad at him, or You should just keep it to yourself and enjoy as you see fit|`|aBwQ06A6aa	Burn them, that's pretty creepy. If u cant burn them, break them so no one can see them and trash em.|`|uTMEWgKfaa	LOL<br>  depends on if you're mature or not.|`|PS83gPGoaa	well if u hate him put them on the internet lol|`|UhWQuxLVaa	just delete n get over him|`|6tzT8GFqaa	www.redtube.com <br>  <br>  under gay!|`|UywxrfGdaa	dont be tight!! how would you like it if he posted you naked playing with yourself! or maybe your a boot and you would enjoy the attention!its proper shady that! and just remember what ever goes around cums back around girl and 1 day you will have pay back for your games!|`|lxBRDcZKaa	Haha A Boy At My School Video-ed Himself "Doing Stuff" And Sent It To The Wrong PErson And Now It's All Around School :]<br>  <br>  <br>  Delete Them Or If You Hate Him Show Them To His Parents Or Something :]|`|HYUkWYrNaa	delete it- by showing other people and making fun of him you will ultimately just cause trouble and **** for yourself in the future.|`|TACI0XJpaa	depends if you split on good terms the destroy it. How ever if you parted on bad terms, well it,s up to you!!|`|XvWHlfkkaa	delete them...duh...<br>  <br>  unless you want to keep watching them haha
O3YbDfDEaa	The relationship is over.......move on.........you deserve so much better!|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	I am sorry to hear about this.<br>  <br>  You can never really trust another human being, but especially not this one. If I were you sweetie, I would forgive him but don't even think about getting back together with him. It will be less painful for both of you in the long run.|`|AA11011446	You did correct hitting them both in the face.  Ditch him and move on.  He's obviously a rat, and the girl is just a slapper.|`|So7lXdBKaa	time to move on, he does not love you the way you love him you cant trust him     no trust   no relationship|`|776b450d88812052e6c7ebe8318a3dd6aa	get rid of him|`|lTOeMNnraa	dump him..!|`|mHETndPiaa	dump him ! if he loved you he wouldn't of cheated on you ! leave him !! but dont loose your friend over him. you will need her later on in life . hope i helped|`|Rs39unEfaa	play hard to get  then take back

xoXkHOVsaa	Do you want to work it out?  That's what you need to consider.  It's going to take effort from both of you.  Talk to him about how you feel and see if he's willing to make more time for you.  If he won't or can't, then move on.|`|VQItBTWIaa	He's very busy, and try thinking that you were in his shoes. Maybe, you could watch him practice soccer, and sometimes visit him at work, and treasure the times you have when you talk on the phone. You really should let him explain first, I'm sure he wants to be with you he's just too busy!|`|FgSTHArKaa	u have to tell him how u feel and tell him u have no problem<br>  ending the relationship if he doesnt have time (but i know you do)<br>  anyways, this will make him scared!! because rightg now he is taking u for granted and thinks u will never leave|`|J5DDjWEcaa	what you need to do is next time he calls you talk to him and tell him how he is making you feel:(
ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	I know, it's hard. Everything reminds you of him and the memories will just pop up out of nowhere. As hard as it is, the best thing to do is just avoid him for a while. Don't try to get back with him just yet. If it was meant to be, you can try again in a few months. Maybe he still has feelings for you too but if he doesn't, there's not much you can do. Try talking to people about it and keep yourself busy doing things you love. It will get better soon enough.|`|bxYP7QK2aa	Wish I could help you honey, but i'm going thru the same thing...|`|F5yNON8Baa	Same here. What I'm trying to do is think of all the negative things about him and get pissed off. Good luck.
ythN9BQgaa	I like<br>  <br>  Eyes<br>  Nose<br>  Mouth<br>  <br>  Michael Jackson has 2/3<br>  But I plan on buying a Mr.Potato head and giving MJ is nose.|`|abx5VNsOaa	Definitely personality,everything else is irrelevant ,if i liked their personality then good chance i'd view them as being sexy.<br>  Love a bit of cheekiness and male chauvenism,as long as they get there's a time and place for it.<br>  edit-it would depend how well i know him,how comfortable are with each other,but i say you play me i will notice and i will play with you,it's the age old game of flirting.As long as there is still mutual respect at the end of the day,it's all good.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	I'd look for:<br>  <br>  1. Personality. Or confidence. This depends on the guy.<br>  <br>  2. Common interests<br>  <br>  3. Looks<br>  <br>  What turns me off, so to speak, is when a guy just has no consideration for other people. Or has no confidence in himself. I don't exactly want to be his rock.<br>  <br>  I don't really go for "looks". But I do like at least somewhat athletic guys.|`|Z32pTHmZaa	Well...personality is definitely first. I love it when guys are spontaneous and fun, but know when to be serious.<br>  Looks are semi-important.<br>  <br>  I loveeeee it when boys wear cologne. Whether its $5 or $65, as long as they smell good. Its a HUGE turn off to me when guys dont smell good.<br>  <br>  I dont really like the cocky boys :l. They can be pretty annoying.<br>  But i do like it when guys are outgoing and are easy to have conversations with and if theyre open minded.|`|3R8bAvfvaa	I love a guy thats quiet and mysterious and has a cute, knowing, spark in his eye when he looks at you. butttttt, im quite quiet myself, so its good for a guy to be talkative once you get to know them. looks are good, but not the most important thing. besides, most girls feel more attracted to a guy's looks if they get along with their personality. i hate it when guys think theyre retarded and ugly though.. dont be cocky and full of yourself, just quietly confident. i love that. x|`|sLVFkEqHaa	well most people say they don't look for looks, and for me that is totally true, but some people do.<br>  I, being myself, look for:<br>  1- can he make me laugh and can I have a convo w/o fidgeting<br>  2- no smoking or drinking or wild car races and i know these are hard to find, but a no profanity dude.<br>  3- smartness. not like a genius, but I can't see my self dating a person who cant add the dinner and tip bill atleast.<br>  4- if. does he have a job? And at 16 it is ok to be working @ mcdonalds or something, but not if you are 23 and have a family to raise.<br>  5- personality. well this is mixed in with all of the above and later b/c you most likely aren't going to find a skater dude who isn't going to make me fidget as we wait for the dinner to come. But personality is a MAJOR key. I don't think we realize it, but you fall pretty hard for someone if you like their personality. sure looks are "an added bonus," but seriously how can you tell someone you love them b/c they are having a good hair day? You can say, "Love the new 'do."<br>  <br>  I don't know. never been in love and i really dont think I have a crush, those are some of the things I would look for though. But then throwing in my personality, he has to love music and be into dance. what type of music (NO PROFANITY, though) or how well/ what type of dance is up to him, but he can't not love those. <br>  <br>  yup.<br>  i think that's all.<br>  i don't know for sure though...<br>  <br>  hope this helped. i don't know how it will, b/c you can't go change your self over dramatically so someone will fall in love w/ you, but i hope it does help.|`|ZTNt9ludaa	All of the above to be honest. <br>  What I prefer most is a man who is willing to respect me and be there for me. Looks do come into it, but really personality is the biggest. Attitude comes in second because arrogant guys really piss me off.|`|c001644d28860bee4adb248a61e06f21aa	Love: funny, cute, outgoing, confident, athletic, sweet<br>  Hate: cocky, arrogant, know-it-all, jerk<br>  <br>  I like it when guys are nice but they also tease me too(but not so much that it gets annoying)
6HfscsALaa	The question you need to consider is, 'do you love him for who he is or do you love him for what he can do for you?' This is an important question for you to answer, especially If your only reason for dumping him is him getting you a dog you did not want.  If you are pursuing happiness in your relationship, loving him for who he is will help that relationship. However, loving him for what you can get from him is a recipe for disaster and will ultimately make you seem unlovable.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	uhm, why would that mean you dump him?<br>  either love the dog, or get rid of it. he'll understand. <br>  it's not that big of a deal.|`|BfuJUvI9aa	wow....... thats pretty mean of u to think that. mayb u didnt get what u want but he still thought about u and neway huskeys are so much better than chihuahuas|`|IDnIo7wYaa	no just tell him you don't want the dog and to return it if your not going to take care of him and love him. <br>  <br>  just because you don't get what you want doesnt mean you dump ur bf. lol.|`|ZyfilGjFaa	over a dog??? thats just stupid.... and don't give up the dog... cause how would u feel if u were a dog and ur owner didn't like u and wanted to return u..... just get a chihuahua and let him have a husky but make sure that u still treat the husky like an equal|`|a87POYvAaa	at least he got you something 0_0 . if he didnt like you at all he wouldnt have bought you any dog|`|uwXmAj1Kaa	why would u dump ur boyfriend over a dog ??? no do not break up with him|`|Ot2jBr17aa	chihuahua are annoying.<br>  huskeys are cool. <br>  your boyfriend made the right choice.
SaDwYkI4aa	just take it easy. act like you don't want him back.  boys want girls they think they can not have. <br>  do not come on to him. do be around to much. don't be available.  <br>  <br>  make him wonder what you are up to and make him wonder where you are. if he asked, then ask him why does he want to know. <br>  so..don't be around for him to flirt with you a lot. and if you are in the same room or crowd, always be the first to leave. it will be hard to do, but remember, you are playing to win.|`|Bws6ZH61aa	If he broke up with you, he doesn't want you, nothing is going to change that.

Why would you want to be with someone who dumped you?
Wzws8v8daa	"On the fence" is a term that means - One who is facing a choice but is "on the fence" has not decided what choice they will make.<br>  so in other words, he is not sure if he likes you or not.|`|0MOXObjkaa	hes not sure if he wants to be your friend or more|`|qy07K2k5aa	He doesn't know whether he likes you or not.|`|7jkS5Cklaa	Exactly that-- he doesn't know how he feels about you.<br>  <br>  But, ask yourself, would you want to be with someone who doesn't wholeheartedly cares for you?|`|v2K249U8aa	He means in between, doesn't know if he likes you or not.|`|E36pdsHOaa	he doesnt kno if he likes u or not<br>  <br>  HI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6tcXKcBgaa	He means: He likes you but does not know whether you are worth dating.<br>  Not being rude or anything. Perhaps you should just ask him to elaborate.|`|IxwmhaoSaa	doesn't know whether to go with you or not, fence meaning by in between something or an issue|`|oRiMAcrtaa	hes not sure, meaning he doesn't know what to do
gjiwSiH3aa	I'm the wife that is going threw this now. A women wants my husband.<br>  That a big mistake on her part. My husband and me loved each other  for 23 years now. She is only want the dick only. I put up with a lot of **** with my husband for years now. I don't think she could do it for years like me. She would leave him in one week. Then he would be crying to coming back to me.|`|KYTTYhK0aa	If he didn't love her he would be divorced. And just be on the wife shoes, would you like your husband to be cheating? you are his toy|`|srAP6Vzvaa	can't stop thinking about him??? i suggest do some busy work. be productive.|`|0XGWM9nUaa	dont be with him because if hes doing those things to his wife hell prob end up doing it to u|`|QVjagGXPaa	I won't judge you, I'll say that first.<br>  Second, if he does not love he wife, it will be his individual choice to divorce.<br>  And lastly, there are plenty of men in the world. Do not ruin another person's life (the wife) for your personal, or his personal desires. It will be degrading to your character.|`|NxsUEHoYaa	first of all....you are a child and he is an adult....that's wrong to begin with!! you should definitely drop it...i hate to break the news to you but he doesn't love you he is just using you for fun because hes having issues with his wife....i would stop seeing him immediately if i were you|`|IxwmhaoSaa	DON'T DO IT, DON'T  DO IT!

1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yes its wrong to do this if you don't know how you feel about him. This is what men refer to as a tease and you are leading him on.<br>  <br>  A kiss on the lips is fine, that's not really making out. So thats ok.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	yes its wrong|`|X1A9rNWtaa	Yea that is, guys get definitely get hurt that way. List the good and bad and see which one wins kissing him now definitely leads him on so clear it up...;)|`|1E1m0ZOFaa	you shouldn't really do that, i think you should tell him and see what his reaction is
puNruxWFaa	Just be yourself, If the guy is worth anything at all, nothing you do will phase him.|`|g7DO92Yzaa	maybe  you unconsciously  screwed it up.  could be your not ready to make a commitement..as to offer your heart to some one can be a big step....just take it easy and slow..you will know him when he comes around..but maybe you should train your self to not start an arugment with him and let things take place as they will|`|uxRFWnkKaa	ha ha you must be retarted|`|briRpzL1aa	It sounds like his is misinterpreting your actions.  Meaning, I suspect the "arguing" is more of him being embarrassed and defensive..<br>  <br>  In short.. Put a big smile on your face, just ask questions about him at first, and then pretend you are very interested.  Every guy will fall for this...|`|ehm3vCYXaa	No, it just means you're a normal person. Don't let it discourage you too much. Just be yourself and someone will like you for you.|`|B1vCpMEwaa	No there's nothing worng with you!<br>  my opinion is if you screwed it up, then it wasn't meant to work out in the first place.<br>  I screw up a lot too, but at some point there's gonna be a guy who likes that you screw up and accepts you the way you are.<br>  For now if it doesn't work, just take it as it wasn't SUPPOSED to work out anyway.|`|C6eyQbhiaa	lol your just nervous..and if a guy really starts to dis-like u becuz of an arguement then he doznt deserve u nd u shuld luk 4 a guy who can have a convo with u nd not get mad over somthing dumb..so basically just be urself nd everything good will happen|`|rULqETS5aa	nothings wrong with you, i think that u just need to let the little things go... lik try not to start arguments with people, and think before u act so that you dont get on others nerves|`|UebWhbD6aa	i think u have a crush on him
DD6jZc5faa	Oh come on people! Seriously? Major difference. A french kiss is just a kiss, where a make out is an expression of not only your lips but your entire body.|`|8zfXJxxraa	Nothing|`|SjD1aKT5aa	Well to be honest french kissing is a form of a kiss and making out is what you describe as probably quite passionate which could lead into fk but there is no difference between the two.<br>  <br>  :] Kiki|`|AA11493831	Based on my experience usually french kissing or tongue kissing, last no longer than 5 minutes and usually our hands are either on each others faces or necks, while standing up.<br>  <br>  While with making out usually it's in a sitting down position or laying down, it's a combination of french kissing, neck kissing and groping that can usually last a long time.|`|ccsk0XLUaa	French kissing is more mouth. Make out is more tongue<br>  <br>  I think......|`|LGCLmUTnaa	They are the exact same thing. But people more commonly say "making out."|`|RmQzb0Avaa	they are the same|`|lnkOwDvmaa	For me french kissing is just with your mouth and tongue, while making out includes the hole body, like hugging and touching while kissing, like the hole session before sex...|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	I am not sure there is one, but I would be interested to find out.
vbjgMBdVaa	yes|`|OP8sRCbTaa	Yes.

dw440Lylaa	Try talking to him in person.......unless he's a really good magician, he can't just disappear.<br>  <br>  There are literally thousands of possible reasons he went offline........here's a few<br>  <br>  1 His computer died<br>  2 Power failure<br>  3 Got a phone call he had to take<br>  4 Someone walked into his room<br>  5 Brother or sister kicked him off computer<br>  6 Had to use the bathroom<br>  7 His pet goldfish died<br>  <br>  <br>  You get the point, next time you see him, ask what happened, then spend some time talking with him, and getting to know him<br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|LSWnwRjEaa	no offence, that sounds so stupid. im sorry<br>  <br>  MAYBE HE HAD TO GO AND EAT HIS DINNER?!|`|rnbt5PEOaa	maybe he didn't get the message...maybe he just doesn't care that much about the drama show. Maybe he didn't find it funny. ...I don't really find that kind of stuff funny at all. <br>  <br>  That was just one type of convo, it won't mean anything, and if the convo was that short you still have another shot at talking to them and maintaining an 'impression' good luck|`|mC1MMximaa	umm I think that your over reacting. I know that u said guys only, but honestly, I feel that girls and guys will answer this the same way. I doubt you turned him off, i think he just got bored and logged off, or his mom told him to get off the computer or something. Calm down, breath, your blowing this WAY out of proportion.|`|K4Q3eirFaa	I know you just want guys to answer, but I have some experience in this area here. Guys just dont really care that much, end of story. You need to reallllly hook him at school if you want him to talk to you when your not at school.|`|L4jMOVvPaa	maby he had to do something? im pretty sure you didnt turn him off.<br>  <br>  u should talk to him about stuff at break or lunch. even if its just for that little minit.|`|FjOaPK2Baa	wtf? why cant he log off? oh smack its a law to stay online! lol<br>  <br>  either forget about it or steal his phone and log into his aim/other im for him and keep it on and put the fone back where it was...|`|eU2xTwVzaa	the INTERNET might of got disconnected and its not ur fault i don't see how u would turn someone away just with joking

What I mean is saying it was a secret and you two don't know each other that kinda is like "well okay big deal...." And you could be over reacting with him signing off, maybe he had to go or he had to get ready for the drama thing whatever the reason, you responding with "i was joking" honestly didn't mean anything to him.

ibeVcQyWaa	Don't worry so much.  In a few days, he'll "like you again", but you won't like him any longer.  Than in a few more days, you'll "like him again" but he might not like you so much.  I'm guessing you're just kids because most adults don't fall in and out of "like" on a weekly basis.  Maybe there will be a week where you two actually "like" each other at the same time!|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	Yes that's happened to me before, you know they can't handle the rejection.

jimNqqsyaa	you're not a virgin. some girls don't have a hymen and others break it through other activites so if there isn't blood when you have sex it doesn't mean you're a virgin. the hymen has nothing to do with virginity. his penis went in. penis in vagina = sex. there's your answer.|`|bEahxLcFaa	okay... well you had sex so ur not a virgin anymore... ur hymen just didnt break yet.... sorry ?|`|mefxIQP9aa	No, you're not a virgin anymore. Once you've had vaginal sex, that's it.<br>  <br>  Your hymen may have broken another time, probably from some other activity(running, biking, splits, etc.) and is possibly the reason why there is no blood. The first time does not always consist of pain and blood. Lots of girls say that and the media emphasizes it but it's not always true.<br>  <br>  You really need to educate yourself about sex. For a 21 year old, you sound like an idiot. I'm one year younger than you and I know more about sex.<br>  <br>  Stupid schools cutting out sex ed.<br>  <br>  Another note, "virgin" is equivalent to "the inexperienced". It doesn't really have anything to do with your hymen. That's just some made-up B.S. by the kids so that they can feel better about their mistakes. If you have no experience in sex, you are a virgin. You had sex, hence, you are no longer a virgin.<br>  <br>  1st Edit: You're not 21. A 21 year-old can't be that stupid. You had vaginal intercourse. Period. You are a non-virgin.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	You may have lost it early in life on a bicycle or in some small trauma from childhood. The virgin thing signifies no penetration and as this has already happened then technically you are now experienced and no longer a virgin despite the hymen.|`|FAQnVhH9aa	I consider penis in vagina to be sex<br>  and having sex makes you not a virgin <br>  but that's just my opinion|`|iHlRHGHcaa	If he entered you you are not a virgin, you don't have to have your hymen break to not be a virgin|`|AeJbSuNNaa	You are no longer a virgin.|`|0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	Um ... medically? Yes, you're still a virgin.<br>  <br>  Morally? No. You had sex with your boyfriend. Penis + Vagina = Sexual Intercourse.<br>  <br>  Sorry to burst you ... well ... whatever|`|Hgd9Ln0Zaa	?  Of course you are no longer a virgin.  You had sexual intercourse.  The hymen has nothing to do with whether or not you are a virgin.|`|8zfXJxxraa	Nooooooooooooooooo|`|XasLRQnXaa	putting his penis inside of your vagina is called penetration, so no, you're not a virgin.|`|6a054048746da7edf01f4a2e7fa8cac0aa	you had sex YOUR NOT A VIRGIN|`|XJWHmcHmaa	I   WSIH       I   WAS      YOU     I  DID       IT       TO<br>  AND       DON'T        STAY        WITH        THE       GUY.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	No you're not a virgin anymore, because you had sex. The hymen is not completely closed because the menstrual blood needs to come out of you vagina. The "hole" in the hymen is different in size in all girls. If the opening of the hymen is smaller it may be more painful during first sex. Maybe the opening in your hymen was larger or was already torn due to sport or other activities. Many girls don't feel any pain during their first time. I didn't feel any pain and there was no blood. So, you're no longer a virgin.|`|4wkeI0Ocaa	If it was al the way in, you are NOT a virgin.<br>  <br>  For a lot of girls, it just doesn't hurt. For a lot, it does. It's different for everybody.<br>  <br>  And even (on some odd chance) you were a virgin, who the hell says you can't have sex? It's a completely natural thing for two people who love each other. So go ahead.|`|yazZH4khaa	You are no longer a virgin because you were penetrated. <br>   There is a goofy old saying that says if you wait another 7 years (without having sex) you will be a born-again virgin- lol.<br>  <br>   Don't worry about it though. Just do not get pregnant or get a disease.<br>   You are not a bad person because of this experience. We all have to live and learn; part of life.|`|0DGjPqWeaa	Well technically you're not a virgin anymore if he did put his penis inside you. It is possible for a girl to not have an hymen, so I'm sure virginity isn't measured that way. You had sex, so you did lose your virginity. That's the point. Thus, my verdict is that you're not a virgin anymore.|`|67f3b10d3a9621246f20e07cfb82e4bcaa	Sorry hun I hate to break it to ya but you're no longer a virgin no matter if you did not bleed he still entered you and that's considered sex.  Besides when I had my first time I did not bleed.  It happens to a lot of woman.  PRACTICE SAFE THO hun you don't need a baby coming along unless you are ready.  Have a good day!|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Yup. If there's no blood, then most likely, you're still a virgin. Depends on your standards between a virgin and a non-virgin, but a virgin is typically still a virgin if the hymen has not been broken.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest to go to a doctor, though, just to be 100% sure. If you want to, that is.|`|u5nYlVMxaa	If his penis entered your vagina you are not a virgin.<br>  <br>  Some woman break their hymen through use of tampons, riding bikes/horses and other day to day activities and don't even notice.<br>  <br>  So, nope you're not part of the V club anymore!|`|GmxR7Mo6aa	No. If you've had sex you are not a virgin. The hymen usually breaks during sex, so sometimes people use it as an indicator of virginity. But the definition of a virgin is someone who has never had sex.|`|Ekzym4kYaa	depends on your definition of a virgin most times for me is when i get it in wether the girl has blood or not.<br>  <br>  not all girls bleed on their first time <br>  if you want to consider yourself a virgin go ahead|`|4UkyrTKZaa	you arent, Im a virgin.

All guys can be attractive as long as they show it but n|`|a4qzfDq2aa	no
rnbt5PEOaa	it could be a mixture or combination of all that...maybe his last gf broke up with him cause he was clingy or something, he's probably shy too if this was his second kiss. I think he just had a bad first gf experience, and doesn't want to come off as wanting or requiring a relationship. Just mention to him that it bothers you that he doesn't do anything first, but try to do it in such a way that it's not a huge issue. Eventually he'll probably "man-up" about it, he's probably just unsure of how he's coming off to you and is trying really hard not to mess it up by becoming too attached and irritating you.|`|YBgK8Nk0aa	I did the exact same thing with my last guy-<br>  I was too scared of talking to him too much, and being clingy, and kind of.. jumping into the relationship when i didn't know if he definitely was into that or not?<br>  So its probably something like that.<br>  <br>  Also a lot of people don't really like texting, so they only think of it if someone writes to them.<br>  If its really worrying you, just ask him about it.|`|w6MJKr2Baa	Personally, I'm not a texting fiend. I don't do it often so I normally don't do it first. He's most likely not just sitting around texting. He's a guy and we're normally doing something and don't just text people. (I don't anyway.) I wouldn't look too much into it. It's not like he isn't returning them, he is so I shouldn't be that big of a deal. He might not be the kind of guy who's clingy.|`|4VYcsSdQaa	I think it might be right to do that if its bothering you that much. I think he might be doing that because he likes u and doesn't want to seem despreate. like he might want to text you all the time but he wants to make sure he dosent annoy you.|`|hmVvpvyaaa	y don't you call him not txt|`|AI0GJFwjaa	He probably thinks that he doesn't deserve you, and doesn't have much confidence. He doesn't want to 'bother' you, and he's afraid that he'll seem too needy instead of being the independant man society wants him to be.<br>  <br>  My advice is to talk to him about it, and tell him that it makes you happy when he calls or texts you.

0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	That response is her way of saying "I can't tell him yes, we can get back together because that would be putting myself WAY out there and I don't want to get hurt again. So I'll tell him we can meet up and hang out and that way, I can see what his real intentions are: if he really likes me and wants to try again or if I'm just a booty call who's going to be dumped in a couple months."<br>  <br>  It's Girl Code ;)|`|adqX7hOHaa	basically she probaly means, i stilll wanna have fun with u like kiss and stuff but she doesnt want to put up with the troubles of having a boyfriend. xx|`|JKQmEFcmaa	well it depends, who broke up the relationship in the first place? because if it was you she may be scared that you are going to hurt her again and in that case yes stay around she will trust you again and then you will have hope. but if it was her then she would rather have you as a friend.

5bdCKtzeaa	That story is exactly what has happened to me in the past 2 weeks thats amazing there was a field trip the lesson of talk and following to lessons and of course the joking around... amazing.  Anyway I dont live in America so I dont think its him (me) answering the question lol.  The best way to let him know your interested is just to tell your friends or ask them to pass the word onto him discretly.  It will go around fast and that way he will be prepared.  Thats what friends are there for and Im sure you would do the same for them.<br>  <br>  So good luck and go get him.|`|XmY8AJyjaa	Well you could just tell him directly that you like him and that you want both of you to hang out together. Or you could tell him via email or text if you can't tell him face to face. <br>  <br>  For me, I just can't handle the fact that I like someone and they are on my mind all the time. Its torturous for me lol. So what I do is just tell them. Don't care at all if u get rejected, at least there is closure and he can get out of your mind. Telling him would only take 10 seconds. And don't have any regrets. If his answer is negative, don't take it personally at all. No one likes to flirt or go on dates with a person they don't have feelings for. That goes the same for u. Trust me, there is always a nicer better looking smarter more talented guy out there in the world that you havent met yet and who would do the same things that guy did to u and sweep u off ur feet.<br>  <br>  Since both of you are not so close, maybe you should get to know each other better.Spend more time with each other first before telling him you like him and going on dates. <br>  <br>  Start off by asking him if he wants to hangout with you and some friends (friends that both you and he know) at the cinema, restaurant, theme park, beach (great place), mini golf/golf course, parks for picnic and games,  sports club, go to each others or friends' houses, club/pop concert, ice skating, carnival, amusement park etc. <br>  <br>  After hanging out like this several times and having just loads of fun, both of you woud know more about each other. Then you can tell him you like him and ask him on dates.<br>  <br>  So 2 choices: tell him now u like him and go on dates OR hangout with him and friends many times then tell him u like him and go on dates.<br>  <br>  Remember: telling him is no big deal at all unless you make it one. It's all in the mind. I am very sure both of you would still be great friends even if he says no.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck with this sweet guy! :)) ^^|`|9PaRdlwcaa	Flirt your butt off.|`|W4HNrbXvaa	Flirt :]
YbnEr1z7aa	maybe he likes, you. he also could be forgetful and not know your name and feel bad about it.... im new too, so i know what your going through on the lady's side and the guy. on the guy part, everyone is always flirting with you and its just kinda hard to talk to people face to face without knowing them very well.... on your part, you want him to like you but probably only because of everyone else.... like him for him, not because hes hot.... get to know him more, try to face book him or text... things will come around give him time
6avkO7hraa	follow your heart my friend !<br>  your heart wont lie too you !
Bd16ixUQaa	I've had personal experience with this.<br>  <br>  He really needs to go talk to a doctor.<br>  <br>  And moving in together is not the answer, but there is hope.<br>  <br>  Now, I suffer from depression and have been depressed while in a relationship and have said some of the same stuff and felt the same way to my bf.<br>  <br>  The best thing he did for me was to be there for me.  Even when I pushed him away, he was still there for me.  Don't take the stuff he says personally.  Don't get mad at him and try not to be offended.  He just needs to know that you're there.  This is going to be very hard on you and very hard on the relationship so it'll be hard to hang in there but eventually he will resurface from the depression and your relationship will be deeper because you stood by him in a time when everyone else abandons him.<br>  See the thing about depression is that when you're depressed, you pull away from everything and everyone and self-isolate and because you push people away then go away but this only confirms your distorted thoughts that no one loves you, no one cares, etc which causes you to be more depressed.  It's all really crazy.<br>  <br>  The other thing though is to respect his wishes. If at a certain time he doesn't want to talk or wants to be left alone, do that. But always come back and check in/check up on him later so he knows he hasn't been abandoned.<br>  <br>  Don't let him cut himself off from the world.<br>  <br>  But really, he does need to go see a doctor because they can help. Depression is an chemical imbalance in the brain and all the love in the world can't fix that unfortunately.  But there is help.  So, please, convince him to seek it out.<br>  <br>  Best.|`|FwiK6WJTaa	Find something he'll love every day you can. Something that will make him smile or laugh. That might help.

I know it's easier said then done but i have the same exact problem. But think of it this way...when everyone else gets older in a few years(by college)and gains the freshman 15 we'll still look good and the guys will want us, not them!!!|`|d924p3rbaa	look;  <br>  i look younger than i am.<br>  even though i have normal sized boobs and a butt.<br>  <br>  <br>  the problem with me is that im short.<br>  either way boys like me.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  now for yur problem;<br>  <br>  you are beautiful inside and out and if guys arent picking you...its fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  dont let it get to your head.<br>  <br>  <br>  you need a guy that likes you just the way you are.<br>  <br>  be yourself..that is all that matters!<br>  (:|`|P21RQ8xpaa	dont let it get to your head!|`|Uau0QkEeaa	um belive u r pretty inside and out|`|due4tljLaa	theres realli nothing you can do. trust me. i have the same problem. lol. but i have big boobs. but i look 14 and i'm 16.. just tell them when you first meet them that your 17 and dont take your best friend with you. take some other friend. and if they are looking at her boobs and butt, they dont want her because of who she is. they want her for sex.|`|85hQ0ARlaa	Try waring clothes that fit a little snug but are still comfortable. They will make your boobs and your *** a little bigger and try wearing shoes that make you a little taller.
zW8tc64qaa	I know this is cliched, but you should be yourself. Don't go faking it now, because when the time comes for sincerity and authenticity, this guy probably won't like what he sees. Its better to be real now, rather than to disappoint him later.|`|LvixLNfoaa	i could give you a very shallow description of my dream girl, but after being off the market for more than 3 years now I can tell you the most important thing you need to know:<br>  <br>  Honesty and being yourself<br>  <br>  I know it sounds cliche but it is the truth. It also helps you to find somebody who accepts you the way you are.|`|NROtjfFSaa	It depends on the guy you're looking at. Some guys like really peppy, talkative girls. Some guys think those same girls are annoying as hell. It just depends.<br>  <br>  I look for a girl who has a similar personality to mine. Opposites do not attract in my case.|`|hnFFodXgaa	Be yourself. Seriously. Dont fake who your are. That kinda junk is just annoying.|`|WK8MZlLdaa	be urself. seriously. otherwise u will find it hard ot keep it up. and get moer hurtful later|`|3cADVRxaaa	Omfg....

uHWFX7cMaa	I think he does. Why else would he kiss you? Good luck hunney<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|aBwQ06A6aa	Definitely. If ur too shy to ask, text or email him. Ask him out for coffee r something like that. I think u guys need to talk.|`|UhWQuxLVaa	maybe....ask him and find out|`|U5dCFomCaa	awww.. that's a cute story. i think he likes you, b/c then why would he kiss you? unless he's a player but you would know if he was right?<br>  i think just ask him, since it seems you guys are comfortable with each other?? right? idk.. or if you're scared you don't have to do it soon just try and figure it out and think about it. maybe the next time you see him you could ask, "so you like anyone yet?" or something like that.|`|8BlsO3ncaa	He likes you but that doesn't automatically mean that it's the start of a wonderful relationship. Take it slowly. When you see him, be friendly but not too eager. Guys are more complicated than girls and often feel a great confusion about themselves, let alone those around them.<br>  <br>  After the kiss, he might have thought "I enjoyed that - we should spend more time together" or he might have thought "I hope she doesn't read to much into that kiss." Only time will tell.|`|aAqB8i8Waa	well duh..the chemistry is still there..its pretty ovious that you still like him and he still likes you.:)<br>  you guys should give it another try and see what happends....tell him what your feeling inside..im sure he feels the same..|`|X5Fq3mOraa	I would say yes, he kissed you and flirted with you all night, that's a pretty good sign he likes you.|`|bXF1gDTcaa	well kissing usually implies that|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	Sounds like it. But you broke up before. Is there not negative energy from your breakup?<br>  <br>  Maybe he misses your relationship. If he does, and does not want another relationship with you, he needs to stop it because it's only going to hurt you both. Why did you break up in the first place? If the problem is likely to recurr, don't even think about it.<br>  <br>  But anyway, sounds like a yes. Or he misses being in a relationship.|`|3zYfwLmGaa	MAyb
HAHA2u13aa	Don't be so hard on yourself,when you do crush on a dude,you have no clue that's he's going to chose to be homo sexual,Sigh,so sad!Peace|`|7OTJW7fAaa	If you're fairly young, a girly guy is a safe crush.  He's someone cute and someone you could see yourself hanging out with, but not someone who would pressure you to become sexual.  Don't worry about it.  Everyone you are attracted to is teaching you what you like in someone you envision as a boyfriend.  Everyone you are not attracted to has some traits that keep you from seeing them as a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Start writing down what it is about each boy that you like or don't like.  You'll start to see a pattern.  In the case of celebrities, you are choosing physical appearance or someone they're pretending to be for the camera.  You don't have the opportunity to know what they are really like; to know their character.  In the case of guys you know in person, it may be something in their personality that attracts you, not just their physical appearance.|`|sYxtPBziaa	Women like gay men more. Fact.|`|yFdKtjQVaa	you could crush on a cutie asian boy, they have femy faces.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v254/Kano_Rikku/KamenashiKazuya2-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v254/K...</a><br>  <br>  same guy: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ladyfrostfurr.zoomshare.com/album/Famous%20Asians/images/e119f6532d81edb2cd9f9d074b2a7d9b_11395136410/image.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ladyfrostfurr.zoomshare.com/a...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tortenetek.hu/data/images/blogs/16933/KatTunTaguchiJunnosuke28.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortenetek.hu/data/images/blo...</a><br>  <br>  they're adorable, theyr from a band kattun or something. only two of them are gay. <br>  <br>  ok and the reason : <br>  if your more feminine you'll gain feminine features<br>  i knew this gay guy who became more and more like a girl everyday, he couldn't even grow hair anymore.|`|v2K249U8aa	It may be the way they look. Maybe you can't control it but just like guys with a girly appearance.|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Haha Bless|`|VKZw1rnqaa	Its because thats YOUR type.<br>  <br>  fix it? go, and inhale hollister manly cologne, and have fantasies of husky men (;|`|zPMRS45Eaa	First of all, drop the bit about being mad at yourself. There's nothing to be mad about. You are perfect in your creation. Period. What you are attracted to is unique for you, just as for others...nothing wrong in that. The masculine in you in attracted to the feminine in the other, and the feminine in you is attracted to the masculine in the other. If you're 50/50, then you are attracted more or less to 50/50. If you're 60% masculine, then you'll be attracted to 60% feminine in a man.  This has nothing to do with sexual preference, but the balance of the our masculine/feminine self. Be happy with who you are and you will attract the right person for you. Don't think about how you always attract gay men, think about the person you really want and how wonderful it's going to be when you meet him.  Then let it go...and let the universe work in your favor.  Good luck my friend. :)|`|kYPiU1BJaa	If that's how u r, then that's how u r.  Eventually you'll find the right person for u if you look hard enough =)|`|gFViQVViaa	Don't fear Bill Kaulitz isn't gay that's just what people say because..... Well look at him.
RmQzb0Avaa	they proley think ur gayy b4 u ask one of them out<br>  <br>  but i think you should just be one of the guys and NOT one of the girls<br>  <br>  once in a while we want someone to talk to but we usually turn to our girls <br>  <br>  ok|`|mefxIQP9aa	Yeah, stop helping out chicks that you like.<br>  <br>  Only help out girls you consider to be friends.|`|lijNJznEaa	well, they probably think that you're, you know, 'on the other bus' and therefore don't wanna go out with you. what you should try to do is just help out occaisionally, and just act like your average bloke. <br>  (as the meerkat off the car insurance adverts)  'simples'
Ix4wLPJ5aa	Ok  i think you should just step back take a deep breath and say.  I love you.  <br>  <br>  if not...<br>  <br>  Some times love isn't always shown in words...<br>  Sometimes its shown through actions...<br>  <br>  Just do something that you will think he will love.  Something that maybe only a girlfriend would do.  Like say you trust him with anything and tell him something thats very inportant to you.  Then say you love him if your up to it.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Give him a great big kiss and then just say it cause that will blow him away.|`|0XGWM9nUaa	just wait till he does something funny or whatever and say it|`|WK8MZlLdaa	sit down next to him and have a long private conversation with him. tell each other ur feelings and try to understand each other. it doesnt have to be " I love u". u can tell him that at the end of the conversation that u love him and it will come out naturally. good luck.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Actions speak louder than words. Show him you love him, don't tell him. Let him say the L word first. When he's ready he will tell you. Guys are scared of the L word.|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	i think you should say it,<br>  maybe he's shy about telling you too.|`|FLPRFTccaa	say ' I LOVE YOU'. not complicated is it?|`|kYPiU1BJaa	Someday, go out on a hammock, and watch the stars, and grab his hand and whisper "I love you into his ear."
seMpUL8Kaa	I finally had to courage to tell this guy I liked him. We text each other often and I knew I couldn't tell him to his face, so I text him and told him. He told me he liked me back!! I was loving it that day, but the next day he told me he was back with his ex. I felt like a d!ck for doing it after that.|`|uvt5W6roaa	Once some of my friends and I went to Ceader Point. We exchanged cell phone numbers. For some odd reason we ended up lost. We couldn't find each other! So we kept texting my other friends, and saying "pick up your phone!" Well, no wonder they didn't pick up. One of the phone's my friend had the whole time, and the other one was the wrong number! We mixed up to digits to the person we were sending the message too! They replied, "What's going on? I am at work." We felt really bad, because we had called and sent text messages to that phone a million times. We replied sorry, and they said it was okay. They thought it was an emergency though!|`|fkmCo1WPaa	well this is kinda embarassing.<br>  i just got a girls number and her name started with an S. and so did my friend. so once i got it i went to txt my friend and i said "YES I GOT HER NUMBER. ITS ######### blah blah blah" and i accidently sent it to her.|`|0XGWM9nUaa	yes my bf was making me mad this morning and im still with him even tho i know he cheats and i just said i dont think we should talk anymore and he was like what do you mean? and it went down hill from there.... and i know i cant leave him cuz it would hurt more
mnMNPT35aa	Tell ur friend first. If she is ur real friend she wont care and if the relationship doesn't work out it has nothing to do with her.|`|WqZYpMwnaa	yeah
aITWZoQzaa	I think with kids that are still in school it would be just fine.  I don't think boys your age really care.
k5ag3cd9aa	talk 2 her friend to bring up an conversation 2 the girl u like, n the conversation should be like " hey do u like" wat ever ur name is, n the next day ask her friend wat she said|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	its easy to fix just write it down .. then read it back to her when you see her good luck mate|`|AA12041135	You don't have to be alone to talk to her.<br>  Just go up to her and say hi, and have a normal, friendly conversation. Just because you go up and talk to her, the person with her shouldn't take that as a red flag and immediately assume you like her.<br>  You'd be better off just flirting with her and hinting to her that you like her, than telling her you like her straight out. One of my friends once told me he liked me, and I felt really awkward and had no idea what to say. But if you're going to anyways, do that alone. But don't be afraid, just go TALK TO HER.|`|oOD3dYaNaa	I know it is nerve wracking, but think of the positives that the first move could lead to versus the negatives. <br>  <br>  Just go up to her and say "Hey! What's up?" Even saying that could be the start of something amazing. <br>  And what's the worst that she could say? No? What human being says no to another saying hello? LOL <br>  <br>  But anyway, then just keep the conversation going from there. Ask her questions that don't have a yes or no answer, because that'll keep her talking to you. Like "So how's your day?" and stuff like that. She'll think you're nice and sweet. And you'll definitely have her attention.|`|LazJHDzVaa	ahh young love i remember what it was like to be in your boots and honestly mate just go for it, just say that you like her and that it would be a pleasure for you if she would let you take her out for a bite to eat or to the cinema. if you get knocked back then you will get over it, but for god`s sake go for it even if there is 1000000 of her friends it will kill you later if you dont take the chance|`|JWjq5iaXaa	grow some stones and ask her out. my god.|`|manCQ4Lkaa	Okay. I am a girl so I can help<br>  <br>  <br>  A- Talk normal and ACT CALM! girls hate guys who act all drooly and act puppy dog eyed.<br>  <br>  B- Compliment her ( dont over do) and talk about her intersts as well as yours.<br>  <br>  C dont be who u r not ( its better to be hated for who you are than loved for who ur not)<br>  <br>  D- smile and walk around with her<br>  <br>  E- get easy. dont touch your hair or shove both hands in your pocket.<br>  <br>  F- Ask her for help. she probably will help.<br>  <br>  G- respect her opinion<br>  <br>  H- Dont talk trash about anybody. gives u the wrong impression<br>  <br>  I- Be SMOOTH<br>  <br>  J- Don't be desperet 2 hang with her. give her SPACE, dont call her all the time<br>  <br>  AND finally when u asking her out. dont make it seem like a date. like say " hey we or I am going... saturday. u should come along. it will be a blast with u.<br>  <br>  ( p.s  make sure ur asking her out 2 something she likes to do or where she likes to go)|`|jixdk8wraa	Don't tell her you like her yet. You need to establish some form of communication before you do. Honestly. Just force your way in there. Get some flirting going on. Talk to her on a daily basis or close to that, even if it's just hello. But make sure you can hold a conversation for a least five minutes with her before you tell her about your crush. Otherwise she may be scared and possibly weirded out. It's nothing personal, just an instinct for girls....<br>  Good luck =) And GET IN THERE SON!!|`|GokA3YGkaa	You have to make the effort to want to talk to her more than just hi.  Get to know her.  Ask her about her day... what did she do.  Get to know her by asking her questions or bringing stuff up to talk about.  You have to put in the effort for that.. or the "hi" stuff won't go away.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|L4jMOVvPaa	dude you only live once unless your a hindu or whatever... not the case.<br>  <br>  if you like her then even if your nervouse a conversation will come up. dont be nervous as there is no reason to be. even if you just talk to her then im sure she will talk to you and make all other future conversations alot easyier.|`|OEB6GcmBaa	don't care what other people think i mean the kids at my school know that i like her but i still flirt with her. good luck!<br>  o and just be your self around her and talk about things you like|`|1AyRPRSOaa	Just get to know her without pressuring her with the I like you stuff<br>  <br>  That might come later, but not now|`|NxsUEHoYaa	ehh this is tough...you shouldnt just go up to her and tell her you like her because even if she likes you back she wont know what to say cuz it will be awkward. just start a convo with her casually and get to talking to her. after having at least like 5 different convos with her thenn you can tell her you like her....( how do you even know if you like her if you never talk to her and dont have any classes with her?) also if you cant even talk to her without having her friend try and get her alone then you already have a problem,...u should try it on you own cuz you cant always depend on her friend to try and get her alone....best of luck to you!|`|R2gV4qYwaa	its a question of gumption. <br>      this is going to be hard no matter which way you cut it but you have to just go for it. sit her down and say somehting along these lines: "i know we dont have any classes together and i know we barely know each other but im absolutley crazy for you. every time i see you its hard for me to breathe, like right now. i can hardly believe im telling you this and its incredibly hard for me but you need to know. I like you, a lot" then tell her to think about what you said and then some other time talk to her soically so that it wont be so strange. hope this helps.|`|iV9FeTjxaa	first just start smiling when you see her in the hall way, this is a real confidence boost for us girls,<br>  <br>  then say hi, be nice, and when you do meet her, start off with a compliment, ask her about interests and stuff, see if you have anything in common,<br>  <br>  but NEVER EVER  lie, or pretend you like something she does, we hate phony guys,<br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck<br>  xxx|`|IfIIrCMzaa	just be yourself! don't be nervous.. we can always tell when a guy is nervous.. just talk about anything.. ask her how her day was? if anything interesting happend in her classes? maybe what she's doing over the weekend ... just simple things like that. you should be fine! just go for it and have fun! lol|`|7Doy5z89aa	Just tell her how you feel, I know it might be hard, but it works. If anyone told me they liked me, i'd feel nice inside, even if the person looked like a badger. So just tell her how you feel. :)|`|wmnSnTxZaa	Be honest but not overbearing.|`|FjOaPK2Baa	wow her friend is gonna organize a 1 to 1, face to face, for both of you???<br>  thats rare... this days...<br>  <br>  good luck...|`|cPtuDMFYaa	I'm not sure how old you are. But if your older enough to go out just go up to her and say "Hi, I was wondering if you wanted to go out some time..?" And being nervous doesn't matter. If it was me, and you were nervous, i'd just go all jelly-like aswell. But try to show her your confident. And theres a boy in my class that always shows off - and it works! He always talks about what he does with his mates (funny things) or like naughty stuff. As in "I got sent out nd she was shouting at me and she spat in my face! I was like, I prefer the news not the weather plzkfnx" something like that. I hope you understand what I mean lol. Girls like rebels aswell. As long as you aren't OTT. I hope this helps (:
FZKFLTyLaa	Yep, Kiddo, He's playing on you and taking advantage of you being a bit less mature than he.
h1qCOpFEaa	maybe you are not hanging out in the right places, besides you look hot, that is likely the reason why|`|e9dHHGCSaa	I don't know, maybe you're tall, or very pretty and guys think you're out of their league.
LOchqddhaa	I have had that happen to me too. Just because he ignores you, doesnt mean he doesnt like you. You just have to give it time, talk to him, but dont talk to him too much! Guys sometimes dont always know when things are bothering girls. Maybe you should talk to him about it. That would help, I bet! Hope things work out, girl!|`|8MHlZlwraa	no he does not like you <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307144922AAhOqHu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|JWKFxaXIaa	I suppose I can't speak for all guys, but if I like a girl then they would know it because I would be around them as much as I possibly could<br>  <br>  but if I was gonna go with my instinct I'd say he doesn't like you, but would like to be friends with you

GmxR7Mo6aa	They're a bit of a turn off, but I would never turn down a girl only for stretch marks. They probably aren't as noticeable as you think they are, especially if they've turned white (they will if they haven't already). Hey, everyone's got their flaws. I used to be really self-conscious because I'm a bit knock-kneed (my legs bend inward at a grotesque angle). Then I asked my friends about it, and only one guy had even noticed. Just pretend it's not there; you'll feel a lot better and most people will never notice. And if someone does point it out, make a joke out of it ("Oh yeah, I'm part zebra." Or something.). If they still make fun of you after that they're petty and shallow and you don't need them anyway.|`|FAQnVhH9aa	you don't sound too fat or anything.. so I'm pretty sure guys aren't looking at your stretch marks while in a bikini haha don't worry and definitely don't point them out because they probably don't notice|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	it's not terrible.  not as nice as not hvaing them but not terrible.  5'6" 120 isn't a turn off though.|`|5XoK45rhaa	Ok i have stretch marks too all at the top of my legs and under my legs. i think there really not attractive but its not something that would put guys off. its nobodys fault having them and i say whatever guy doesnt like them are really pathetic.

hwzPjUaVaa	well I'm assuming you're thinking about doing it, but you're scared. Don't be. It honestly doesn't hurt like many people say it does. It's a good kind of pain. Your first time is going to be awkward no doubt, especially if you're both virgins. My first time, i knew my bf had sex with other girls before me. so when we started going out he knew i was a virgin. he never tried to do anything. so when i went for it, he practically told me we shouldnt because i was a virgin, i told him i wanted to and he was the right person to do it with. so my first time was kinda awkward cause i didn't know all these different things and i didn't know how to rly 'move' but it was fine, we both enjoyed it, and the other times were 284982645897x better. It does feel really good, and once you start havin sex, it makes you want to have more. idk what a guys point of view is in the whole situation.but i know most of guys like when the girl takes control. so once ur confident enough. take charge! and dont forget. virgins usually bleed, so lay something out on the bed, or use old sheets and throw them out later.|`|76kQpCj6aa	whats the do ?????hotty|`|2tn8EALqaa	as in do someone a favor?<br>  Feels good.|`|AA10408380	to each person, it's different. For some it's a great feeling, for others it isnt. Ur experience might not be as wonderful as someone else's would be. It all depends on the couple, and the situation. So here's my two cents. My first time was great, my last time was aweful. yeah, sounds like it should've been the other way around right? I hear for most women it is, but not for me. I guess it's because I'm a very emotional person, so the first time I felt like he loved me, because he showed me, but the last time, I knew he didn't love me, because he showed me. Actions do speak louder than words, u just have to analyze them to know which words n actions to believe.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	First time it might hurt. Maybe the first couple of times but then it feels good, especially if you really love them. Please wait until you're at least 16, 18 is better.

You wouldn't ask this unless you were considering that.<br>  If you don't break up with him, sit down and have a long chat with him.  Tell him what you want.<br>  He's being immature.  <br>  Maybe you could even suggest a "break" from each other for awhile.  Go out and find someone who respects you and you'll see what love can be like.<br>  As my own mom might have said to me.... At 17 these should be the best years of your life!  You need a guy to go places and do fun things with, someone who does more than sit around and watch TV.  You can sit around and watch TV when you are 50, not 17!<br>  If there is no money, you can still get out and hang with other kids your own age, even go to the library, walk, take a bus trip to a city and explore together, even play a game like Scrabble or Monopoly.<br>  You are bored, and if he'd rather be out drinking with his friends than with a great gal like you, there are probably lots of guys out there who would gladly take his place and treat you like you deserve to be treated.|`|vslxaZs0aa	you guys need to get out more! go on double dates! go do something stupid and take lots of crazy pictures. make an album of you guys, ask eachother stupid questions and just have funn. instead of the movies, go share the biggest banana split youve ever seen:)|`|XCPctxGHaa	wow . maybe it just wasn't meant to be<br>  idk what to say i understand where you're coming from<br>  but maybe he wants it to end<br>  & this is his way of telling you<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope everything works out though .|`|83b2830758260afedb6fe44dedab9e66aa	u hv been dating for 7 months.. ull surely ms b havin sm sort of understandin ryt... speak 2 him abt it.. its best 2 b frank and tell him ur mind..|`|sO2CKU1uaa	Invite your bestfriend over for a threesome

W0KQTXrvaa	you're going to be single for the rest of your life|`|AA11806606	Trust is the foundation for a good relationship.  Since you started out this relationship based on mistrust; it had no where to go but end.  Whether or not she was a virgin was none of your business in the first place.  For a woman this topic is private information and only after being together for a while should it be brought up.  If it wasn't important to you, why did you pursue it.  Sounds like it was very important to you; and thus, you lied in this question.  You put her in a very embarrassing situation and of course, she won't forgive you.  Furthermore, you forced the issue by asking her old boyfriend who maybe just lied because he WAS the old boyfriend.  No relationship can not last without trust.  You blew it from the start and got what you deserve.   How would you like it if the shoes were reversed and she double checked into everything you told her?  Wouldn't feel to good would it?  You are a jerk.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Dude, she's a liar. You hurt her feelings? She lies to you and she's managed to turn it around already and make it out so you're the bad guy. That's a bad sign of a passive aggressive manipulator. I'd head for the nearest exit if I were you. It's like Hitler telling all those jews it's their fault because they made him feel bad. Well, it's not that bad but do you see my point? She lied. Now she's trying to manipulate you into feeling bad so she can control you. She's not coming back right now because she knows now that you want her and that you're easily manipulated. She's just setting the stage for future absolute control of you. training you to come begging to her even if it's your fault. <br>  <br>  Don't fall into this trap. Move on.<br>  <br>  You had every right to ask that question. Of course you did. In fact, in this virus filled world only a fool wouldn't know the sexual past of their potential mate. You were not in any way out of line and she should have told you the truth. End of story.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I really cannot tell you from this question.  I do not know how important it was to you that she was a virgin and I do not know how hard you pressed for details.  If she loved you and you made it clear that virginity was all important, yes, you really hurt her by not accepting her answer.  Should she have lied?  No.  But guess what?  People lie when they cannot accept the consequences.  It doesn't make it right, but I think it is still true.<br>  <br>  BTW:  Exes lie too.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I don't understand why you would believe her ex over her.  I don't see why you consider his statements to be automatically truthful.  Do you love him more than you love her?  If you're gay, that would explain this.|`|0bDEGdRdaa	probably both EVEN though she lied, it probably hurt her that you would think she would lie if that makes any sense........she's probably embarrassed by it as well, give her time, just let her know your there.|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	Liers are always dangerous Better be away from her.|`|FCcbgriuaa	She should of been honest with you from the start but you probably hurt her by even asking such a matter. Why should it matter if she is or not a virgin? What matter is if there is love in the relationship.  You should of not asked,  thats her place to tell you on her own when she's ready to tell you.  Give her time she will be back if not she was never yours to start with.|`|bglr4m0Naa	I'm 23 years old and I'm a virgin you are a COMPLETE MORON for not believing her... simply because it's uncommon.

Move on you can do better than that piece of trash.|`|MdhkBhLPaa	well you should have tried not to be so questionable. <br>  YOU really put her on the spot. YOU really hurt her.|`|8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	There is a thing called a Secondary Virgin, someone who remains celibate for the sake of purity after realizing mistakes were made in the past.   <br>  <br>  If she would not have sex with you during your relationship, why would you question her?  And if you wanted to have sex with her during your relationship, why would it matter?   <br>  <br>  You fool.  You had a girl who loved you enough to wait for you -- even if she made mistakes in the past, she learned from them and chose a different path, and abstained from sleeping with every Tom, Dick and Harry that came along so that she could be only with you, and remember what it was like to be with only you, and not compare you to the last five guys she slept with the year before you got married.  <br>  <br>  You don't deserve her.|`|bA5FOMOBaa	Well she obviously thinks that you just do not trust her, and because you found out about this (which is slightly embarrassing) she may think at any other relationship problem you will instantly bring this back, think your stronger or remind her that she lied.<br>  She hurt you too, by lying it destroyed the relationship; if she just bluntly told you she was not a virgin these concerns and lies wouldn't of come about. <br>  Maybe she feels hurt because she could of been telling the truth but you thought she was lying, which means you have no trust for her on such a sensitive (to an extent) situation. <br>  She may of been hurt, but in all honestly you are no more in the wrong than her. Talk to her and tell her that you just want trust because you love her( if you do that is...) and don't think you can just let her walk out of your life.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|AA11830777	Since there isn't any trust wouldn't it be better that she not come back. You'll just have other issues. <br>  She shouldn't have lied, however there is probably a reason why she didn't want to disclose her sexual past. She may be ashamed, was hurt, whatever her reasons it was her right to keep it a secret.|`|T02BJJGjaa	When you dabble in the past about sexual relations, you are bound to cause trouble.   Someones past, yours included, has nothing to do with your current relationship with someone.  Why do people always want to delve into what happened before they came along?   Sounds like both of you have serious trust issues to the relationship is better off being broken.|`|oEtl16sJaa	Try to ask her for a meal and just talk to her and try to understand how sensitive girls are compared to men.

If you couldn't trust each other maybe it wasn't right.|`|cMyPQ90vaa	well to be honest the past is the past if it was before ya'll met it shouldn't matter you should leave it alone not unless it happen while ya'll were together. just sit down with her and let her know how you feel and tell her that your sorry for bringing up her past. good luck|`|FXBCYFhuaa	I don't understand why a woman would feel hurt if you don't believe the lie that she is a virgin. She could have told you the truth and and give honesty to the relationship. You're better off without a woman who tries to hide the truth.|`|LIhly5a7aa	Having someone remind you of the mistakes you have made only makes whatever pain and strife you are feeling a million times worse. Especially when it's the person whom you claim to love so very much. I am sure she is feeling guilty for having lied to you but feeling insecure that you couldn't trust her. You had every right to know about her past considering all the stds that are out there. When it comes to something dealing with sex everyone should be educated. It's only fair that you know you could be putting yourself in jeopardy. I am not saying that she has any of these things. And I am not saying anything bad about her but you have every right to know. My suggestion would be tell her everything you feel but remember every time it's brought up it opens those wounds. If she doesn't want to go back to you then she surely doesn't deserve you. Something else you should think about...if she broke up with you because she lied to you, what else would she lie about if she could get away with it...|`|chlvKoXqaa	She wanted to start off her life with you based on a lie, i can just imagine her pretending it was her first time, lol what an act, this only proves how deceitful she is. Now after sex with you, she will go onto another man pretending it is her first time. You don't want a woman like that.<br>   THERE IS NO SUCH THING CALLED SECONDARY VIRGINITY, ONCE YOU HAVE INTERCOURSE YOU ARE NO LONGER A VIRGIN, EVER. THIS IS A TERM SLUTS MADE UP. any sex outside of marriage is fornication, read God's word on where fornicators go.

N2BAdOXEaa	I am sorry for your loss, but your bf is filling a void that was not filled by you. Maybe he is afraid of getting old, and wants to live his younger days again, or maybe she is really thrilling him at this moment. Usually does not last long, but it will probably be way to late to recover your damaged relationship. Communication is the key in a relationship, and filling another person's desires seems to make it last. But it has to be from both partners, one can not over compensate for the other. The giving in, and taking has to be some what equal.<br>    Good luck with your choices.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Its not right|`|nmQZIYutaa	He wants someone he can manipulate and you are far to experienced for him to do such so he got with a niave 19 year old. I don't think it's wrong because age is not a factor after a girl turns 18. It's a life lesson for her. You should move on and find a real man and not worry.|`|0ovrxdQTaa	you not 30 you are 19  honey its not right to be dating 30 year olds you are nasty ill gross never date 30 year olds they might be childmalester

dGyX3E8Faa	Yeah thats definitely a great idea. Girls talk and stuff happens. That girl definitely seems she would like you.<br>  <br>  <br>  But I agree, those girls ask boys type of dances are really stupid. At my friends school they did that for "morp" which is like prom except they made the girls ask guys.|`|RdMpPhhPaa	get her friends to suggest you...|`|X5Fq3mOraa	That's kind of funny, my girlfriend is a grade lower than me, and actually asked me to a dance like this, though it wasn't a backwards one.  In my opinion, i think you should just ask her to the dance, it will be easier for the both of you, and its not like you will be shot if you break the rules.  <br>  Otherwise, get your friend to drop a hint.|`|KbbL1Wemaa	That's a good place to start, but honestly, those "backwards" things for school dances are dumb.  I'd say only half of people obey the "girl asks guy" thing.  I'd go ahead and ask her! Even though you may be nervous, most people love to be asked to school dances.|`|o0kAn1UGaa	Get one of friends to work for you secretly.Then at the dance get them to dare her to go ask you to dance works every time.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Droping a hint is good, but if all else fails ask her.
c0102fddfeaef7a79d662d939f998e68aa	My wife tells me it does hurt the first time you do it, and it is usually not enjoyable the first time. You shouldn't do it until you are completely ready to do it. You have all the time in the world, don't rush it.|`|th45yP4Xaa	It does hurt at first, especially when your younger. Maybe when your 16? You know when your ready and when your not.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	You're way too young. You will just end up regretting it after you guys break up and wish you had waited for the right guy. Don't do it. If you guys are still together in a few months and are very serious about each other then MAYBE you should start considering it, but I think you are way too young. Even if you use condoms, you can still get pregnant, and no 14 year old is ready to be a mother.|`|SuMwWNfyaa	Youre 14.<br>  <br>  do not do it!<br>  <br>  <br>  You shouldnt let boys pressure you.no matter how much he says he loves you and stuff.<br>  <br>  <br>  Because your scared and dont really want to do it,it wont be as enjoyable.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and if something where to happen (even if u used protection) you would get preggo,and he would leave you.<br>  <br>  no matter how much he says he loves you.|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	Yes it typically hurts the first time, and DON'T do it until you're older and with someone you really really love. I wish I hadn't lost my virginity to the guy who took it. Ever since then I wished I could have it back and give it to someone who really deserves it, not just some guy who was horny and desperate for sex.|`|zy5qcc0Raa	You're only 14!!! thats no age to be having sex! dont let him pressure you into doing something you dont want to do and what you know is wrong!|`|quYp2Ajtaa	ummmm your 14. Dont do it.|`|AA11682450	hey!! STOP!!!! no, don't do it. In my opinion you shouldn't EVER have sex with someone UNLESS you truly believe you are in absolute love with him, when you think of your future he should be the only person you see yourelf with. You shouldn't have thoughts of other guys, or even be joking "oh he's cute" with friends. You should be sure you want to grow old with him. Otherwise you are just throwing away a precious gift on someone who won't ever appreciate it the way it and YOU should be. If he really loves you and you tell him no, he will be okay with it and not ask agan until you yourself let him know ith no other influences. Besides, 4 months isn't long enough to really know someone for who the really are.  Heck, do you really even know yourself?|`|uWJJyNR3aa	If you're scared or even have second thoughts, Then you're obviously not ready.<br>  of course it hurts. And it'll take a while before it's even enjoyable... but if you ask me, at fourteen, you are way too young.

Answers, then you are clearly not mature or confident enough in yourself to be having sex. In fact, if you need to ask anyone, then you're not ready. When you are ready, you will know because you will want to have sex, and not just because your boyfriend is pressuring you. Teenage boys can't help being fixated on sex but try to talk to him about how you feel (when you're NOT in the throes of passion!) and explain why you want to wait. If he cares about you, he won't mind as long as he gets to spend time with you. Take things at a pace you feel comfortable with. Maybe you will have sex with him eventually, or maybe it will be with somebody else, but there's no rush to get into anything now.<br>  <br>  And when you finally do lose your virginity, remember to use birth control!<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|Iyc5vrEcaa	It isn't going to be enjoyable because you are scared and don't want to do it. Though you obviously could, your body and mind still aren't as ready for it as they should be. You don't want to regret it. I'm ten years older and even at my age think that 3 months isn't a very long time to get to know someone and to be comfortable having sex with them. Take your time and don't do anything you aren't ready for, and don't ever feel obligated.|`|o1ibwPKPaa	Don't do it! Since you are younger it will probably hurt more. If you really feel the need to tr usuing tampons to get used to it a little bit more (if you have your period), try to get on birth control and make sure to use protection. If you really wanted to then I would tell your mom that you are having really heavy periods and really I think the only thing to stop that is to take birth control so you could get it without your mom having sex...but really it's not what you want to do. It has only been three months sex isn't worth it.|`|XvPoezxpaa	Don't do it!!! You're not old enough you don't really want to do it and its really not good. Your virginity is sacred and give it to someone you truly love and who loves you back. At 14 u aren't in real love and you'll regret it right after and that regret will stay with u especially when u find the 1 u really love. I was 18 when I lost mine and it was worth it because we loved each other then and we still do. Your virginity is special mama keep it as long as possible. Don't give into the pressure! If he loved u he wouldn't have u consider something he knows you're unsure of|`|FGSNuP1Uaa	Only 3 months?!! Don't do it. I think it all matters on your maturity, your stupidity, and how long you've been dating in order to have sex, and if it's only been 3 months, then after you have sex, things will get old fast. Your boyfriend is probably just horny, and isn't in it for the "relationship". And yes, it will hurt.|`|cg3IaThxaa	Don't do it.<br>  I was in the EXACT same position as you. I was 14, almost 15.

There are lots of issues related to having sex. There are STD's (sexually transmitted diseases) and the possibility of pregnancy. <br>  Often the first time it is not enjoyable and can be painful.

Stay pure for your Husband. If you were intimate with him, he would probably lose interest and go on to the next one. Talk to your Mother or some one. Good Luck!|`|A0MTKSoiaa	don;t do it. you're too young. believe me, you'll regret it. just think about it. do you really want to do it? there are so many bad repercussions. even if you use protection, STDs are VERY common in today's society.|`|MQ9yMdq6aa	ok im a guy and thats all what a guy wants(sex)......but if he loves you, he will wait until your ready.<br>  <br>  btw your too young to lose it so my advise to you is to not do it, its not fun|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Don't do it wait at least a year.

I'm not such a **** anymore, and the guilt has subsided, but please be careful. You don't want your first time, or any of your sexual experiences for that matter, to be regrets.<br>  <br>  I advise that you wait until you guys have been dating for 6 months. Make sure you love him, and he loves you. And do it somewhere special.<br>  <br>  Sex changes everything. It's the end of the chase for a lot of guys, and he just might stop liking you after he gets what he wants. Even if you're gorgeous and have the best personality, once they've had you they usually lose interest, especially if you're younger.|`|0eef821e877b14d3114ed09c28394a80aa	14 is still too young plz wait until you are older! Don't ever let anyone pressure you into something you don't want to do or aren't comfortable with. Please communicate to your BF clearly about what is/is not Ok with you. Sex IS a big deal and it involves not only your body, but your mind and emotions also. It requires you to be very vunerable in alot of ways. It's your body, your temple and don't let anyone push you into doing something with it that you don't want. Sex is usually somewhat uncomortable for the female but it depends on a number of things. Honestly it will not be that enjoyable until you get good at it.|`|NROtjfFSaa	Sex shouldn't hurt. It feels really really good. Sex shouldn't be something that you guys do just to feel good though. Be mature about it and understand that sex is just another way of showing how you feel about one another.<br>  <br>  I'm 17 and myself and my girlfriend have sex frequently. It's great. Of course, the first couple times (maybe 2 or 3), it wasn't too great (the penetration part).

Trust me, you'll regret it if you lose your virginity at such an early age, and if people find out, you'll be embarrassed, maybe even ashamed. 3 months isn't long at all any way. Tell him you're not ready. If he's a good guy, he'll wait til you are ready. If he won't wait, then he's not the type of guy you want to lose your virginity to anyway. (:<br>  <br>  And no type of contraception works 100% of the time. Any time you have sex, there's a chance you'll get pregnant.

It was actually a great experience for me because I was totally in love. <br>  I think you should wait until you are positive about it and also in love.<br>  You don't want to be one of the MANY who regret their first time and said it wasn't good.<br>  So just think about it, you can never get it back.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :]|`|I8tlKliraa	PLease don't do it i was 14 was i lost my virginity and its the worsted mistake i have ever made i dated the guy for 3 months just like you and it really isn't worth it wait until you really love the guy it really takes a toll on your emotion.

It's like a horrible cramp. but of course it's going to be enjoyable for him and please make sure if you do this which i think it's awful to cause your just 14, that you USE a condom.

szVvf7Nkaa	I am so sorry but there is nothing that you can do to control this girl. I know this is not what you want to hear but if you stay with this girl then you will have nothing but heartaches. If this is the forth time that she does this then now it's time for you to let her go. She is not going to change. She will continue to break up with you because she thinks you are a fool and she knows she can do whatever she wants with you. But you are not a fool and you need to make that clear to her. And you need to let her go. If you keep playing this game with her that one day she wants you and the next she couldn’t care less if you exist then why do you want to torture you this way. You deserve to be with someone that loves you respect you and appreciate you. But from me have read this girl doesn't seem to know what she wants. And it's not because she is bipolar that you can keep using that excuse for her behavior. Your girlfriend is using you and until she finds what she is really looking for then she will continue to use you.|`|jezA7yqtaa	Well leave her, she dosent want to be with you, plus her family dont accept you!<br>  You will find someone better.|`|QxzxBE5Taa	Erm,  if she is truly bipolar then are you really sure you want to go there?<br>  <br>  There are some conditions that need to be approached with caution and this is one of them.

It was horrible until I got help.  I was trying to divorce my husband, but not really knowing that he really loved me and wanted to be there for me.  I can honestly say he tried everything but nothing he did wanted me to take him back.  I hurt him a lot and to this day I thank him for not giving up on me.  it has been a long rough road, but my life is better I went to the doctor and he has me on medicine I have also been to a psychiatrist he has helped me understand what is going on, to have an idea when they are coming on and better ways to cope with the problem.  First thing first she has to be seeking help cause Im a true believer you cant go through this on your own.  If you really love her and want to make this work repetition is the key.  Always be there.  Just know this is something she cannot help and its very hard on you too!  Good luck!|`|PjIGp7Q8aa	If you really want her back, i suggest you sit her down and discuss the situation.

S0MOQGJJaa	As crazy as it may seem, i think she is really interested in you but possibly majorly hurt that you weren't going to be seeing her for a week. Girls usually take that as an automatic suspicion... did you tell her why you wouldn't be able to see her for a week... and just tell her how interested you are in her and that you will make i up to her in a big way when you are back or whatever... like take her out to dinner or something... i think she is a bit insecure though... getting so depressed that you take pills to cure your depression shows shes not very independent... but tell her the truth... i was a shy girl and am now breaking out of my "shy love shell" too it's hard at first but will realize it's not so bad after u break out of it

Get to know each other, and then ask. My boyfriend is in the RAF so our relationship is classed as long distance. If you think about it, if all works out, not seeing each other for a few weeks/months is nothing to what you can compare it to, having them for a life time. I know i'm jumping way ahead but yes go for it!|`|nETF5rmJaa	go for it! i have a loving boyfriend almost 2 hours away but we make everything work well. you only live once! take the chance!|`|wX46Gv4naa	go for it if you have a really strong connection it will work|`|WK8MZlLdaa	online is risky. u only seen her what a few times? see her seveal times before deciding|`|X5Fq3mOraa	I'd say yes, if you think she is worth it, anything can work out, just remember, long distance relationships cannot work forever, one of you will have to move in the future, or it won't work forever.
3jEakZxCaa	If you really like her then you have to make the first move and atleast try to get to know her more.  I realize your shy (as am I) and in order to get her to fully notice you, you should try to talk to her more.  I suggest inviting her out (in a group) to Starbucks after school or something.  That way it isn't too obvious and you would get to spend more time with her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I Hope this Helped :)|`|N2PxYfAkaa	just because she looks at you and smiles doesn't mean she likes you - likes you, you have to stop being shy and talk to her.

AA11826768	I find it flattering when a woman ask me out. It also takes the fear of rejection out of it for me. I say go for it. If the guy gets offended maybe then he is not the kind of guy you wont to date.|`|EaIR89pbaa	I wouldn't necessarily be offended, but I do think guys should ask girls, especially to the prom. If you really want someone to ask you, it's better to just hint at him repeatedly that you want him to ask you. If he's a few fries short of a happy meal and doesn't catch on, you might just ask if he's going with anyone, or if he's going to ask someone, or if he's going to ask you anytime soon.|`|FLPRFTccaa	i wish girl some would ask me out.|`|RXkRUcxJaa	hahah, some of us would prefer this to happen|`|cUO2zYsnaa	NO WAY HOSAY! Girls asking guys out is how a lot of things start. Gese, I wish the girls in our school would ask me out. They say I'm the sexiest in the class, not one girl has asked me out because they say "asking out is for the guys", trust me. I like these girls, but I wouldnt risk losing our friendship for it. Guys are easy to read, if they act really nice and try to be funny around you, they like you. So go ahead, ask them out.... they're waiting. haha|`|B7idbFNVaa	It depend of how long the GUY know the GIRL.<br>  <br>  I won't feel OFFENDED just SURPRISE that she catch me of GUARD.|`|XasLRQnXaa	I would be fine with it.
C7Ujon3Xaa	Agree with your first post.<br>  <br>  Would like to add that a guy who truly loves you:<br>  <br>  1.) Will agree to take things at a pace that suits you both. He won't rush you into kissing or sex.<br>  <br>  2.) Calling all the time is ok but it shouldn't eat into your private/personal space, otherwise it becomes possesive love and not true love.<br>  <br>  3.) He will not be over-possesive if you spend a little time with your girlfriends or talk to other guys. He will not spend time with you like 24/7 and he will allow you to just hang out with your friends sometimes. In other words, he gives you your space.<br>  <br>  4.) He is not abusive or forceful and wait for sex until after marriage if you say so. No verbal or physical abuse.<br>  <br>  5.) Some fights are ok, but for the major part, you solve disagreements via frank discussion with each other and a mutual respect for each others opinion.<br>  <br>  6.) He respects you and treats you as his equal.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, love is unique and has no rules- You are the best judge to know whether your boyfriend loves you or not.|`|NROtjfFSaa	If he really loves you, he'll wait to have sex when you're ready.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	The guy is telling you that he can wait to have sex with you then you better believe that his love is true. And you should count yourself very lucky to have found a guy like that.|`|IpzapGwgaa	it depends you didn't give really good details.

If its not to far just say you walked home because you didn't want to inconvenience anyone.<br>  <br>  Just be careful please.|`|yyLQTBJQaa	Story A<br>  Just say that your friend dropped u off<br>  but Story A is definately the better excuse<br>  <br>  Story B is a bit more chance that ur mom's gonna find out cuz u've only hung out wit that girl once and the church thing is way too complicated
szVvf7Nkaa	As hard as this is going to be on you I think you have to let her go so she can decide who she wants to be with. Your girlfriend has feelings for this guy and she needs to know whom she wants to be with. And I think you need to break up with her so she gets the space that she needs to find out who she wants to be with. If she has a crush on this guy then she is telling you that your relationship is not that strong. And don't believe that they are only communicating by writing notes to each other because if he confessed his feelings to her then they are doing more then that. Your girlfriend's message is clear that her heart does not belong to you completely because she let the other guy in her heart also. You deserve so much better then this. A strong relationship  is supposed to be with two people and not three.|`|AA10731562	get rid of her crush|`|AA10834046	Relax.  You only get to control your actions not your girlfriend's actions.  She will do what ever she does.  Your job is to be the guy she does not want to lose.  If she chooses someone else, there is nothing you can do about it.  You didn't say how old you are.  Were you expecting to marry her, or is this just a teenage thing that you know will not last forever.|`|NBBRWd5Gaa	as a gf, she should give you her undivided attention.  if she keeps this up, it means she has no respect for you.  if you still love her despite all this, stay with her.  but you need to be firm and tell her she needs to make a choice between him and you, and that she cannot have both.  if she doesn't listen and ends up cheating on you, don't take her back.  shrug it off and move on.|`|ISMColXfaa	You gotta tell him to back off, but don't come off obsessive or desperate. He's being a complete dingus, she has you already.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	well first of all it is SO WRONG on her part to even allow him to keep grabbing her and flirting iwth her. she shouldnt of been flirting back since she was in a relationship. and secondly i htink you shouldnt BE STOPPIN her from seein or talkin to this guy i know your hurting from all of it, but stoppin her from seein another person ends up making her want him even more. you got to sit her down, tell her that SHE CANT HAVE BOTH!!! you feel used right now, and you dont want her to just be playing you and playin another guy as well. if she cant pick and be completly determined to not like him then you got to let her go, it hurts but WHUTS BETTER---- you strugglin to stop her from seein this guy.. or lettin her go since she seems to be playin you like cards?!|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	Truly she is just a *****!

" then maybe its time to move on anyway. a romantic relationship should bring you joy (mine has for almost 20 years now) if it doesn't life is too short to always feel like a struggle. <br>  <br>  let the flirtation take its course - if you are meant to to be... your love will find a way back to each other if not then there is so much to do, see, experience and enjoy in this life. have fun.<br>  good luck

bC5XeVEIaa	Well, you're right to not take his generalizing to heart. I have to thank you for realizing that guys are individuals, too. That being said, sexual attraction is an instinct, not an aspect of personality. Just the same as we are programmed to get hungry, or tired, it's that same kind of drive. Virtually any guy of that age has a lot of sexual thoughts, but it doesn't reflect on whether or not he's a "bad" guy. He could have those thoughts, but still be a complete gentleman. What we are does not define who we are.<br>  <br>  kimmy - you are a sexist retard.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Guys just make those thoughts public, women do it to|`|13k2WKx8aa	95% of the time, the first thought that goes through the guy's head is "I'd do her!" and not "I'd love to pay for her dinner tonight!" The physical over everything else tends to be the initial reaction.<br>  <br>  It's the way the male brain is wired. The sex drive is far more powerful than that of a female.<br>  <br>  The thought of sex probably crosses a guy's mind over 9000 times a day.<br>  <br>  Edit: To Kimmy: Don't forget that we also think with our stomachs! ;-)|`|VAI6MtPIaa	I think both have the same amount of sexual thoughts. <br>  <br>  From what I understand is that men think about the intercourse while the women think about the passion, the connection, heat.. and all of that stuff not necessarily straight to intercourse. <br>  <br>  Men are worse in that sense but I don't see it being that much different. Of course there are more male stalkers, rapists and all of that .. which goes back to the sexual thoughts. I'm NOT saying women can't do it either.. but it's usually men.|`|JW2Ledp8aa	guys tend to be worse then girls for sexual thoughts. <br>  im a guy so i know what most guys think and when they see a hot girl walking their eyes normally go immediately to the girls boobs or *** and they imagine what the girl looks like naked. sorry to break it to you but that's what happens with most guys.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Throw the claddagh ring  , at him and tell him , Im allowed to say I  have another  whopping  swing ... because  Grandma would be proud!   lol...lol...lol...|`|o1gvGrBtaa	its true for some guys the ones that are only interested in sex, but mostly if a guy sees an attractive women he is intrigued by her and wants to get to know her.......and he will only think negatively bout you depending on what you wear(thats for any guy good or bad)|`|84d1LBA2aa	He sounds jealous!

Some of us are able to keep those thought to our self, and we don't all have to speak them, but I think all of us have them. They say men think about sex every few seconds. I'd be willing to bet it might be a little less often than that, but its still quite a bit.

Z6ks4eOLaa	If he loved you, he would leave her. There's no other answer to this. Don't hurt yourself or stress. He wants both you. If he likes her and loves you. Why hasn't he left her yet? Why don't you try moving on for now, I mean there always later in life. Eventually he'll understand what he is doing and let you know what's going on. I really think you should live life without him for a while.  Until he notices his faults. But everyone is different, and your included. So I don't know if my answer would help you. If not im sry, if so, your welcome. Just remember love is stronger then "like". If he stuck in between u and her, he's gonna be in that situation when he meets someone while being with you. But again every1 is different. Just be careful and don't hurt yourself over him, cause if he doesn't choose you, why should you choose him? Good luck take care.|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	he doesn't love you - he is using you for sex.  it's really that simple!|`|kTvn2Nltaa	you don't know what love is... and neither does he|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	I think he loves her, but maybe she doesn't want to give in.

If he did, he  would be with  you and only you.<br>  <br>  actions speak louder than words, my dear.|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	I'm sure that he has some kind of feelings for you otherwise he wouldn't be calling. But the thing is that you told him what he has to do in order to be with you. He can't have his cake and eat it too. If he is that reluctant to leave the girl he is with, then he is lying about not being physical with her. If they didn't sleep together and they hardly talk to each other then he shouldn't have a hard time leaving her. It sounds like he's trying to play both of you. I think that you did the right thing with giving him the ultimatum. DON'T CALL HIM BACK!! Let him know how serious you are about this. Maybe once he realizes that you aren't bluffing he'll actually do something about it. By giving him the ultimatum you've made it clear what you want from him. If he doesn't give it to you then he is not serious about wanting to be with you and it's time to move on, even though I know that will be VERY hard.

Uj5kuzoJaa	No, he was probably just telling you the truth. Maybe he thinks that you're mad at him about it and so he's afraid to try to contact you. Get over it and just text him something like "hey, haven't heard from you in awhile. Is everything ok?" and see what happens then. If you receive no answer, then at least you tried and it's time to move on.|`|W6NGihsSaa	he blow u off and parable went to hang out with a norther girl|`|091LTWTCaa	I was in a similar situation. Since you can't think of anything that may have gone wrong, give him the benefit of the doubt and maybe he DID have to help his buddy. But don't call him, the ball is in his court now since he was the one that cancelled. Wait for him to call you and reschedule. If he doesn't bring up rescheduling after a couple days you might want to casually say "so when can I cash in that raincheck?"|`|RdvL6CGmaa	Dude!!! Don't act so like desperate. Seriously he could have other things he needs to do... There is one thing to learn about guys they are going to do things they want when they want... Maybe he is tired of you texting him soo much so he needs a brake... Another thing guys will be super flirty to get one thing from you and if you don't give it to them they'll try again or quit all together... Sometimes guys have friends too... don't get all bent outa shape because he isn't texting you..... if you are like that this will make him not like you more...|`|0EUBc2hRaa	I'd blow him off. There isn't a reason why he's not texting more than just you. I think he's had about 3 other girls that he flirts with via texting.<br>  <br>  Let him go and leave him alone.

Don't over analyse things just take it easy and see how it goes.
1UiYpUWiaa	seems as though shes getting  some of what you got from this guy and wants to confirm it with you, my advice is to only trust her as far as simple things but not start to have talks with her about her relationship with the guy, if she wants to end with him she will end with him but not because "you convinced her to do so", you don't want to be the one that gets blamed for wreaking their relationship.

vlCWp7sSaa	I would personally show her parents that you care try your best to change for her. I respect you for that- to choose her over drinking. Its a very hard process but I am sure with her support you can do it. When you start feeling tempted to drink just think of the future that you and your girlfriend will have. <br>  <br>  What makes you happy? Your girlfriend or a can of beer? <br>  Trust me- all you get out of by drinking is a damaged liver and a terrible hangover.<br>  <br>  Her parents will ease up a little when you have proven that you choose her instead of alcohol. I have a good friend that I helped who was literally addicted to Weed. At the time his girlfriend's parents did no approve of it. He was also arrested for possession of drugs. He was sent to rehab and some counseling and over time escaped his addiction.<br>  <br>  Now he has his bachelors degree, a lovely wife and child, and a good paying job.|`|tO8ey3o8aa	its never gonna be 100% back to normal but it could take a few months for them to get comfortable again|`|0s93q8Ocaa	They will always worry about their little girl...even when she's in her 40's.  <br>  <br>  It's too bad you messed up.

At this point in your life you have a lot of spare time to keep a bad habit going but still isnt unreasonable to say that you could have kicked the habit.  <br>  <br>  31-70...forget about it, if you go 5 years without a drink you could still lapse back in a good weekend with the boys.|`|C0xoYXDvaa	only change yourself 4 yourself. otherwise the basis of change becomes the reason 4 relapse. my namez doc phil. sike, my namez your girlz dad, and i want u to stop puting our families PRIVATE matters in PUBLIC places like my wife does when with my p*n**|`|8bP67U8Taa	if you were dating my daughter  i would dissaprove too

jixdk8wraa	Act normal sweetie =)<br>  Like you never even told him anything. And don't talk about it unless he does first. Hehe, but go ahead and flirt. Just not too much. Remember to have your fun. Life can't always be so serious. I mean why should it be? No one gets out alive. Just go with the flow =) I really hope things work out for you =)
nmQZIYutaa	You pull him down to you and kiss him. It will make him feel wanted instead of having to get the okay for you. Usually this works best with a taller guy and a shorter girl. But he just wants you to make the first move. Good luck with that.
cB2VGhLgaa	If I were this girl, and the whole soccer tournament excuse wasn't a lie and I actually sort of liked you, I would hope you would talk to me a little more. I would hope you would maybe try to get to know me a little better and then, ask me out again. You should do what you already planned to do. See how she acts when you see her again. If she doesn't seem like she's avoiding you, then you should try to interact w/ her more. Talk to her during class and anywhere else you can (but don't seem clingy). Then, when you feel you know her well enough, ask her to a movie or something casual. <br>  Hope everything works out :)

uJ9waJDYaa	Yeah, some 16 year olds would date a 14 year old.. But then again some 30 year olds would too.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in him and he is interested in you then I suggest be really careful because i know lots of girls who were your age 14-16 who have gotten with boys three to four years older and it was good for a while, but it ended poorly. So if you do develop a friendship and get closer then just be aware and if you want to end it, then stand up and end it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|gpON465Iaa	I have heard of the rule 2/5/10:  2 years apart is ok up to age 21, then 5 years apart is ok to 30, then 10 years is ok to age 40, after 40 anything goes.

cPtuDMFYaa	You need girl point of view. If a girl likes you, she will laugh at all your jokes. She will stare at you all the time. Always smile to you. And accidentally touch you. Its obvious and I honestly don't understand how you boys don't notice lol.|`|gpON465Iaa	Place your forearm on one shoulder, lean forward and whisper in his other ear, "we gotta get out of this place"  then when you move to an area that is private just start asking questions and then do most of the listening, bring up things like, family, sports, cars, friends, school, weather, food, health, tv, movies, music, just ask.|`|v9Zv9aGzaa	stare at meeee!|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	Touching is actually a good answer. That is something that is pretty hard to ignore. Remember, guys are more visual. They don't pick up on the verbal flirting as much.|`|GmxR7Mo6aa	Be really friendly. Smile, laugh. Stand or sit just a little too close to him. Touch him on the arm. If that doesn't work, be forward and tell him you think he's cute (but be prepared to get shot down if he doesn't like you back).

How you feel about it in the dream and then how you feel about it when you wake up shows you what you feel.  If you feel it's right, go ahead and kiss him.  There's nothing wrong with that.  If you like it, keep kissing.  If it's not for you, then move on.  No biggie.|`|cPtuDMFYaa	It's hard to know if you or your mate is gay.

XmY8AJyjaa	Hey Roman S! This is my advice for you. I know it is very long but please read it all since i took the time to write it. It only takes like a few mins.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to get over her is to tell her how u feel and ask whether she is willing to give you a shot even though both of u are not close and do not know each other too well. Because if you don’t tell her that, she would never know you felt that way and hence would never give u a shot. If you don’t tell her how u feel and keep trying to forget about her and keep trying to move on despite the feelings u have for her (u think about her everyday and u haven't liked any other girls since then----this is massive!), there will never ever be closure and u will keep wondering whether there could have been more in store for the both of you like a gf/bf relationship. Who knows, both of you could have been a great couple and could have shared many good times and memories!  And if in the end, the couple thing doesn’t work, then both of you could stay lifelong friends!<br>   <br>  I know u said that both of u r not so close since u didn’t talk to her much and since u r in diff schools now but going to the same college in the future.<br>  <br>  I have one idea for u that might definitely work. It did work for me and my friends. You could send her an email reminding her in detail who u r first and asking her how she is. Then COPY AND PASTE the EXACT paragraph that u typed on Yahoo Answers. Tell her in the email to read the following paragraph. After this paragraph,  mention in the email that the guy in the paragraph is you and that girl is she. Then in the email you can say this may come as a surprise to her but it is true. In the email you can then ask her what she thinks about it and whether she could give u a shot or hangout with u first to see if there is chemistry between both of u and to see what happens. Then end the email by asking her to reply via email or calling no matter what her answer is. Any girl would find that very flattering and would definitely give u a direct and honest answer back via email.<br>  <br>  Just a thought just in case u r shy to tell her face to face!   <br>  <br>  Another idea is a very junior-high school approach but could be effective. Just tell your friends in your old school to pass the word onto her discretely, like as a passing remark. You could instruct your friends to tell her u have a crush on her even though u moved on to a new school and even though both of u r not close. Your friends could also mention that you don't know how to approach her and also mention that they were meant to keep it as a secret .Your friends could maybe suggest to her to contact you and make the first move by telling you what she knows and set a time and place for a date or hangout with u.Thats what friends are there for and I'm pretty sure you would do the same for them !!!<br>  <br>  Another way to approach her would be to to hangout with her and friends that both of u know from your old school at the cinema, minigolf, theme park. parks with picnics and games, restaurant, sports game etc. to catch up and have fun. You could hangout several more times like this with her and friends until you become closer to her then you could tell her how u feel  and ask her to give u a shot. This approach takes a long while and you may not be that patient since you have these feelings for her for a very long time already. I don't suggest this route.<br>  <br>  If u want to tell her directly by calling or emailing her or meeting her in person but what is keeping you from doing this is your shyness and fear of rejection, this is what i have to say: EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the world feels stressed and anxious about confessing to their crush because about what their crush might think and the fact that the crush might give an answer u don’t want to hear like “This is very flattering and u r a smart and sweet guy but i am not interested at the moment and we can still be friends”.  <br>  <br>  For me, i don't care at all if I get rejected or how many times i get rejected. I am a 21 yr old female. I just can't handle the fact that I like someone and they are on my mind all the time and me wondering about What Ifs and What- could-have- happened- it’s torturous and drives me crazy. Even if I get rejected, at least there is closure and he can get out of my mind and i finally have a peace of mind. So go for it. And don't have any regrets.*No* from her is the only worst thing that could happen if u tell her about ur crush and it’s not the end of the world. If her answer is negative, don't take it personally at all. No one likes to be a bf/gf with a person they don't have feelings for. That goes the same for u--- You wouldn’t like to be a bf to a girl u don’t have feelings for. If she says no, she might change her mind in the future after hanging out with u more and getting to know u more.<br>  <br>  Try not to make the confession a big deal cos that would make u nervous and if she says no, you would feel even more shitty.  <br>  <br>  If things don’t work out, i know u will feel shitty and sad and hurt but just keep urself happy, busy and distracted with college, hobbies and sports and u will move on eventually as it is a fact that time heals all wounds. Trust me, there is always a nicer, better-looking, smarter, more talented, more good hearted gal out there in the world that you havent met yet who would sweep u off ur feet just like the way your current crush does...or even more!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Go get her! Believe. Good luck :)) And please try my email idea! It worked for me and my friends!<br>  <br>  It’d be great if u told me the outcome by clicking email in my Yahoo Answer profile page. I like to hear endings.
xoXkHOVsaa	It's hard to say.  He might have just told you that he hated you to make his girlfriend happy.  Now he wants to be friends again.  Another possibility is that he wants you back.  <br>  <br>  If he says he wants to date you, do not do anything until he dumps his girlfriend.  You deserve better than to be the "other woman".
88bDvyiwaa	wrong section.
8zfXJxxraa	Not Really|`|ZRiIBPrQaa	Of course not. I know people who never really fell in love until they were in their 40s and just got married. I also know people who knew they were in love when they were 15, and now have been happily married for over ten years. It's all different for everyone. When you meet that speacial someone, it won't matter how old you are (:
779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	you're not crazy. but don't accuse him of things you aren't sure of.<br>  you just need to talk to him, ask him what's been going on lately because he's been acting weird.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Possibly cheating.<br>  Those sound like the signs. But just remember not to jump to conclusions unless you want to lose him.
YzpfCloRaa	You did nothing stupid. But instead of every 2 months on her myspace, try a couple times every month or so. Even try to work up the courage to get her cell number (If you don't already have it) and when you get it, you can call her and possibly ask her to meet you somewhere. Like for lunch, and you can ask her out -it seems you really like her-. But since you are in college, you might be in a different state then her. So text or call her and say something like, "Hey, -name-, it's me, -your name-, and I just wanted to call and catch up with you. I'm coming home for spring break -say the date you are- and I was wondering if you would want to meet me for -meal- at -restaraunt.-" If she says no, then you can even ask her out on the phone right then and there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. Hope I helped.|`|Fn6vayT4aa	she wont be your gf unless you ask her on a date and no it is not stupid what you did|`|YCUJMvWQaa	hey if she liked tyou before she might atill have feelings for u, give it a shot, life is full of risks|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	Keep in contact as long as she does.<br>  <br>  Don't overdo the compliments.<br>  <br>  If she refrains from sending emails - cut back on the ones you send her.  Maybe just forward funny or nice emails - NEVER anything gross.<br>  <br>  If she eventually stops altogether then it may be best to not irritate her but,  IF she responds occasionally - stay in contact. <br>  <br>   Who knows?<br>  <br>  P.S.  Wouldn't you  rather value her as a friend even if you could not have her as a gf?|`|8eMM6l13aa	you didnt do anything stupid, you just have to talk to her more..<br>  <br>  make some plans to go to the movies or just hang out.<br>  <br>  dont be pushy, it would be awkward for her considering it seems like you guys dont talk much anymore.<br>  <br>  make sure you guys become really good friends and she is showing interest before making a move..<br>  good luck!|`|flMOEeNnaa	Don't expect her to be your girlfriend if you only talk every two months. It doesn't sound like she has a strong interest in you, so I would probably move on.|`|FmWx4Osuaa	yur a very interesting guy...you should go for her|`|ixweJGk6aa	Yep...  You did something really stupid!  Grow a spine when it comes to girls!!!  STOP saying how sweet a girl is, EVER!  STOP being available and easy to contact.  STOP acting like a girl!!!  Hang back and vanish.  Wait for her to come to you.  I know this sounds wrong but trust me...  Let her know you have another life, date girls, ignore her.  Go on and she will want you for it if it is in the cards.   Otherwise, find a new girl, there are 3 billion on the planet!|`|qh6FMaIpaa	Man You should not be asking this question on Yahoo..... Its fairly easy **** myspace call her and see if she wants to be more than a friend. if not don't be her friend anymore........ simply stated the friend zone leads to empty bed syndrome.... Don't be nice go after what you want and she will realize you truely do...|`|wzMhhJi9aa	You are in the friends zone my brother...... I know the feeling...it sucks.... not all hope is lost..... there are the rare chances that things could change....but it is hard if you became that friend... and if you refer to her as "an awesome friend" she might think that thats all you want..... good luck bro....|`|fTOM0aUfaa	Times come and go.<br>  You can ask her again, it's ok.<br>  There are many examples of this watch Zack and Miri Make a Porno or an example i my life.|`|g9g41eSVaa	Contact her directly and ask her out again, if she says no again, find someone else, you are wasting your time.
CZAjVF7Zaa	I say chat to him, get to know him and try to bring him out of his shell.  Flirt a little and see how he reacts.  If everything seems good and it looks like he likes you, then ask him if he wants to go to the cinema on Friday.  If he says yes, great.  But if he says no or looks awkward, just add "Sure let's see who else is up for it?".<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|X05GAaLeaa	Ehhh<br>  Just hang out with him and let him ask YOU out because he is very shy , if you dont let him ask  things may be very awkward around both of you|`|991d9dbadb757302092acf58552d5e65aa	Hi there<br>  If you like him, ask him out.  You'll always wonder "what if" if you don't.  Just ask him to a movie, or see if he wants to meet for coffee or hot chocolate, or go for a walk.  Don't gush out how you feel right away as that may freak him out.  Good luck!|`|RXgYPgo9aa	find a way to let him know you're interested, and see his response.  if its his first relationship like you said and he's interested, take things slowly, ease into everything, and if necessary let him make moves, or initiate so you know his comfort zone.  but if he doesn't know you're interested, he may not want to lose you as a friend and won't risk having feelings for you.  dating this guy could end your friendship though.  kind of a tough game to play.|`|LlfLa4Twaa	If you have a crush on the kid, but he never has had a girlfriend, you  should ask him out.|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	Flirt. Try Hugs, Hugs are so nice :)|`|M2qi33Xnaa	u got his msn
3MefSa80aa	She a rude, mean ***** and not worth staying with. Kick her, and her daughter out of your house. You've spoiled her rotten by doing everything for her. Your a nice person with a good heart and she's a selfish *****. Tell her to **** off and get out of your life. 99% of women dream about someone like you. I suggest using eHarmony to find local singles. You'll have LOADS of dates and there will be so many women who will love you, you can chose the absolutely perfect woman. Don't accept this kind of abuse. Be a gentleman and tell her to get out of your life. Hope I helped.|`|AA11849106	well this has never happend 2 me b4 so i guess that maybe you and her should have a long talk and tell each other how u feel....and i hope tha this little advice works for you|`|0LhAYSyvaa	Sounds to me like she is extremely irritable. <br>  She could be PMSing depending on how long this has been going on.<br>  She could also just be having some problems in her life that she hasn't told you about and is taking it out on you.<br>  <br>  I may not be very old, but I know that one of the most important things in a relationship is communication. My mom left my dad for this exact reason, she wasn't willing to communicate. And my daddy (yes, I still say daddy) keeps telling me that the most important part of a relationship is communication. <br>  <br>  Meaning that I'm telling you to talk to her. Maybe after your daughter is in bed, sit down with her and discuss your feelings with her. If she decides not to listen, ask her if she wants to stay together. If she says yes, say well then we need to discuss whats wrong. If she thinks you're trying to break it off with her, let her know that you're not.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  --Rora|`|b1ojWtmBaa	She may just be in a bad mood lately; some girls get like that if they have been stressed a lot in a short period of time. Is your not having a job stress her out for some reason?<br>  <br>  I'd say do something, just the two of you, to help her unwind. Maybe go out to dinner or even just give her a massage. <br>  <br>  Also, talk to her about it. Ask if she's been feeling upset or stressed out lately and if there's anything you can do.|`|ZOoDYRyKaa	talk to her buddy. try to come to an understanding of what she is going through and feeling if shell even talk. hopefully she can communicate to you whats going on in her mind and life. then take it from there. if with her is where you want to remain both of you need to try and work on whats wrong in the relationship. if you feel its your time to go or you are too unhappy, then let that be known. communicate communicate communicate.|`|KeqTwLWmaa	what can you do holmes?<br>  chicks are crazay|`|wzMhhJi9aa	Y'all need to sit down and talk.  Most likely she is worried that you wont be able to take care of them.  Tell her that you are doing the best you can under the present circumstances and only want whats best for her and her daughter.  Let her know that you love her and the "little" things that have been bothering you.  She should be able to listen and understand that it is hard for you not being the "man" and being able to support them like you used to.  good luck.  I hope everything works out for you

I asked my husband to help me stay on track.  I have been skipping exercise and cheating by filling in the exercise sheet that I keep and that my husband checks.<br>  <br>  I deserve a few swats.  but light ones.
C5UUltHtaa	Keep trying, not all guys are jerks|`|fc6bFYHvaa	Become a stripper.|`|HUbCcKKbaa	It's your fault for stayin in the house. GO OUT ANYWHERE AND MAKE A FRIEND. Make yourself presentable so guys can approach you.
uFi6kworaa	You have summed up exactly what happened in your own letter. She was seeing some other dude behind your back and it wasn't until you found out that she decided to end it with him. How long would this have been going on if you hadn't found out. "Love shouldn't hurt". I say grab one of her friends and take her out and do exactly what she did with that other guy and then if she thinks it's still okay then keep her if not then dump her. I doubt she'll be understanding and would show her true colors. if she's willing to do all this behind your back I wouldn't trust her at all. Their always sorry and it never means anything and it's always innocent up until they get caught and then they want to say it didn't mean anything, well if it didn't mean anything then why was she hiding it from you and she shouldn't mind if you share the same experience that she had with someone else besides her. God I hope you dump her, ten to one she'd be back in that guys arms by the end of the hour.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Sorry, but yes, you can "cheat" without having sex. The fact that she didn't tell you about this person and their activities tells me that she felt/knew that what she was doing was wrong. She would definitely have to earn my trust back.|`|OXohgDoJaa	There is such thing as an emotional affair. Sounds like thats whats happening.|`|FgSTHArKaa	honestly, you will never marry someone like this so why stick around when she cant be an honest, sweet, intelligent girl<br>  she ended it with him yes, but thats when you found out<br>  imagine if u didnt find out??|`|B2UuTy2Yaa	I believe when you're committed and then see someone else behind the other's back that is considered having an affair.|`|IKUrjzucaa	yes it's called an "emotional affair" and the fact that she sais "they clicked"... that's worse than if they just had sex<br>  <br>  what a ******* whore|`|0e71dbd8175a1463f9e1f087150c4b04aa	in short yes if you think about having sex with someone else and you are meeting them and sending text messages that is an affair of the heart just as it would be with sex.|`|AA10487771	absolutely my friend--i have been doing it with a chick over 7000 (seven thousand) miles away since 02--so trust me anything is possible--besides if they kissed+clicked-guess what's      next .if it were me i wouldn"t let her go but man dont marry her..
SCiY5JESaa	turn your back on her until she understands you're not up for the games|`|inST4SlAaa	she is insecure.  she should wait a day before she calls you and tells you such hurtful things.  if she cant do this than leave her.  if she cant figure out how to control her reactions nobody else can|`|X05GAaLeaa	You cant fix her problem , she has to learn to do it <br>  Nothing you say will help her , she can only help herself!!!!!!|`|AA11800096	I think this calls for a little game of hard to get.|`|7Fc22teCaa	Ask her to bang her head here....X|`|FmWx4Osuaa	you cant control how someone thinks|`|R532kalcaa	she doesn't likes you then the next day she does but she overoverthinked that and she doesn't? or she does and i went too far on overoverthink it should jst be 1 think then ok i don't know.
H1qpJc6Daa	Poor guy. Maybe you should pull him aside when she is neglecting him and tell him that you care  ( as a friend or whatever ) and tell him that she is abusing him and that he shouldn't put up with that. If you tell him that tell him not to go Chris Brown on her, otherwise that will just lead to more problems between them.|`|jimNqqsyaa	ouch. tell him he deserves better than what he's getting, let him know what an amazing person he is and how he should be treated.
obo57lVpaa	Never could figure that one out. It's a guy thing and I can't see why they like it.|`|AA10408380	No. I think it's because girls look better than guys do. No. I'm not lesbo. I'm talking about it from a beuty standpoint. Like portraits, a male body looks nice...aka...michaelangelo's david, but any drawing of a female is more captivating. The michaelangelo peice is too, but it's a statue, and so intricate, it's a tribute to the artist's abilities as well as the great king. But it took a statue to envoke this response. But this same response has been envoked by just a beutiful intricate drawing of a female. Plus, guys are more visual, and girls have more curves, and holes to see. Their mannerisms are different too. Plus, they're not guys, they're girls, and everyone(mostly), likes to see something different, than what they're used to seeing all the time.|`|N7mgfDxnaa	i view it like this: a woman is a beautiful creature, along with a womans body. and men love women. sex is an action of attraction, and passion, and like you're really into it, and all about the person. so imagine having two beautiful woman acting like they're crazy about each other in that physical way. i could see that turning a guy on.<br>  <br>  plus it's like they're putting a show on for the dude.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	society and people believing does. Can all white men cant jump? No, but im sure some white kid probably grows up hearing sooo much he probably doesnt even want to become a basketball player. The power of society forcing beliefs on people. Now it seems like "its the thing to do" for girls to touch each other. I see it all the time. My friends kiss each other all the time, when they are drunk. Nobody really cares.

It sounds like he is using you because he feels you will always be there.<br>  <br>  If he continues to hurt you like this, I would suggest breaking it off with him, permanent or not, he will realize what he has lost.

I stopped going to school and withdrew from everything and everyone and just stopped caring about things.Maybe you should talk to a councellor at school or a nurse about how you have been feeling this way.

Keeping a journal try (www.livejournal.com) also helps because its a nice way of letting out your emotions. Dont keep it all bottled up inside.

I would just tell him next time I meet him for coffee but I think he will jump at chance of no strings but I don't want no strings either.<br>  In your case, I think you ought to be braver and less cowardly than me and tell him over coffee. Don't drink alcohol when you tell him. Stay sober.<br>  And tell him that it's not him and it's you and you have stuff going on in your life right now so you cannot commit.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Tell him you are not looking for a serious relationship right now.

Guys debate whether or not to just become a player and never settle down with anyone or "get back on the horse".<br>  Now is a good time to enjoy being single.<br>  Figure out what YOU want and who YOU are.<br>  You can't have a healthy relationship with anyone else unless you know what you have to offer.<br>  You'll also come to realize what you want in a guy, as well, and now's the time to reflect on what made each of those relationships turn out horribly and what little red flags you should be looking out for when you decide to try dating again.<br>  And don't EVER settle!<br>  The right guy for you IS out there.<br>  But you're never going to meet him if you keep making the same mistakes.
0c2jew2xaa	Dude don't worry. To get your ex back if you really want to just take it easy. Maybe bring up the good times that you guys have had before. Talk about the things she likes to hear. If something happens your the shoulder she cries on. Your her everything. Talk to her friends and ask what's up with her. why she wants the other guy. What was wrong with u. Don't try to act to happy, and don't mope over it to much cause then she'll think that your obsessed. Just try to act like you guys did before you guy "took a break". this should really happen. Don't try making her jealous like in those gay chick flick movies.|`|8gvsUlUyaa	Dude i aint tryin come hard here but she broke up with you because she has a  two year crush on some other guy thats wierd.|`|d680cd7544e1739548307e4b1d9732afaa	What u should do is act like u dont pay her any mind and when u see her and she's staring or say hi then just say hi back. Because if u keep pressing her and coming back telling her how u feel then she isnt going to take u seriously. But if u show her that u dont really need her as a front and kinda ignore her then she will come back around and see that u are serious because if u keep letting her know then she's not going to take u seriously but if u show her that u can have anybody that u want then she will see what she have and she wouldnt want to lose that so just give her some time and do u.|`|062dcebc0cae227b915e6808bf0dcd18aa	Perhaps you could ask her out for a meal so you could have a chat, just as a friend? Explain you are only available (at the moment) as a friend and not as an ex. She will then be more likely to accept you, I guess.<br>  You could tell her that you understand her feelings (even if you don't) and prepared to wait until she's ready (This doesn't mean you are binding yourself to wait an indefinite period of time till she makes up her mind).<br>  <br>  Good luck.

That's your instinct telling you that you need to get out of this unhealthy relationship.  Your boyfriend "really" loves himself and he needs psychological counseling.  Anytime you are in a relationship where you are made to feel like you must have done something wrong is the time when the only right thing to do is to save yourself.  You should talk to your parents before you end this relationship, because you're going to have big problems doing so.  He's a classic stalker type case in the making.  Please be careful.|`|6Rru2901aa	Just reading this is frustrating. Get out of that relationship before he bring you down with him. Rememeber that girl who really like her boyfriend but he was the same as yours; boring suicicidal and making everything about him.

BKr3y30maa	Personally, I would be a little concerned that she is giving you her number when she has a boyfriend.  Aren't you worried that she may give another man her number if the two of you do actually end up together?  That is something that I think you should stop and think about.  If you do decide to wait, I wouldn't wait long.  You don't want to be standing on the sidelines and miss out on a great opportunity to meet someone.  Best wishes and good luck.

lNlL0Ag2aa	He's letting her know that she's letting herself come on him too quickly for him to feel comfortable around her. That seems to be more of an insult because for me, it implies that he doesn't like her behavior so it could lead to, not being interested in her at all.<br>  <br>  But, it does mean that the girl is approaching him too briskly and should take it slower so she can get to know him.

If you can't talk to your parents or even a friend the next best thing is to talk to a counselor (if you are still in school) OR go to the nearest church and ask for the Minister.  Ask him if he has time to talk, if he doesn't have the time ask when would be a good time to meet.  <br>  <br>  You need someone who can help you think things through.  Someone who can help you think positive with all the negatives in your life right now.<br>  <br>  Make a list of all the good things in your life and a list of all the negatives.  Then make a list of what or how you want to go about changing things in your life and tomorrow start working on the changes you want to make.  <br>  <br>  Change doesn't happen over night.  But months down the road or maybe even a few years you can look back and see that things are getting better.<br>  <br>  It sounds simple but it is not!  Please seek out a Minister (or counselor) but find someone who can help you think things through.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself if your friends are the right kind of friends.  (Do they get you in trouble?)  Do you get yourself in trouble?  Do you know right from wrong?  Are you easily tempted?   <br>  <br>  You said you have God but you haven't talked in a while.  Well, I can't think of a better time than right now.  Ask Him for help.  And again a Minister can help.  You don't have to belong to the church - the Minister will help out in some way.   I'm rooting for you!!!!!
aWcD7Ou5aa	Grack is right.  Just don't discuss religion with your dad.  Ask him if you guys can just not talk about it so you won't fight.  Your dad is the more stable one.  But, autistic kids are really smart and they are no harder to take care of than any other kid.  They're pretty cool actually.  I'm sorry for you and I hope you'll be on your own soon.|`|sBsFK2h5aa	Normally, I say your mom, but it seems like she needs to get herself together with her boyfriend. And seeing her mom have sex? Gross. Even though your dad has a different religion, you could talk to him about it. Learning about other relgions can be interesing. Sure, he may use it against you in fights, but things can be sorted. Plus, its seems you can help your step mom a lot, and get a good education. Hope you choose well, good luck!|`|UH67GysTaa	thats tough. id talk to your mom because thats rediculous. that should never happen.|`|AOgK773Eaa	That's a decision you should be making. Not me. Think it over.|`|r8rykCkGaa	pray and ask for God's guidance.  Because I don't have the perfect answer, but you know that you can get stronger either way, because Jesus will be with you and he will bring you out of so much turmoil.  So, trust in the Lord with all your heart.  Jesus knows what is best for you and he can do abundantly above all you can ask or think.  (See Proverbs 3:5-6 and Ephesians 3:20)<br>  <br>  Stay in the word and the Lord will speak to you though his word.  Ask him to speak to you and give you a word of encouragement and a word of guidance.  Ask him to give you help and strength and courage and everything you need.  The Lord will hear you when you have repented and when you pray according to his will.  It's not hard.  Learning how to pray takes practice and you have a good opportunity to practice.  By the way, what religion is your dad?  If it's a false religion, it would be bad to be living with him but then, the situation with your mom is so bad too, so the Lord is able to deliver you out of everything.  Keep praying and asking.<br>  <br>  Jesus said:<br>  "Ask, and it shall be given to you, seek, and you shall find, knock, and it shall be opened to you.<br>  For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened."  Matthew 7:7-8<br>  <br>  "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness."

I dont think it would be nice to be waking up to your mum and mums boyfriend having sex do you?? Well it sounds as if your dad cares about you<br>  Hope i helped??|`|LTsmr0SPaa	As long as your mom has that boy-friend, there sounds like an escalating chance pf violence. It also sounds to me like the boyfriend WANTS you to hear them having sex; that's another alarm bell. He's going to hit on you sooner or later with this pattern of behavior. Get out until he's gone. <br>   I'm sure the religious references get upsetting--have you told your Dad that? Or offered to go check it out once or twice so he can't say you never gave it a chance?<br>    About the healthy eating--I've been cooking a lot more fresh vegetables since we started getting those microwave steamer bags. I like glad best because it has a flat bottom. So say you by the baby carrots--all they need is to be rinsed off, put in the bag, and microwave them. Serve from the bag; put away leftovers in the bag; reheat in the bag and throw the empty bag away. No dishes involved and they taste amazing. It would be healthier for your little brother, too. If you get the microwave meat entrees like pot roast, it might take 2 of them for a meal, but again there aren't going to be pots and pans to wash.<br>    I'd only stay with your mom unless she ditches the boyfriend because I don't trust him around you. Making sure that you hear them having sex is creepy and an abuser's way of trying to get you more interested in having sex.|`|bHdsvFqQaa	It sounds like you should go with your dad, because if you go with your mom, you'll be exposed to their fights and you need to be in a "functional" environment as you grow up, if you have the choice.<br>  <br>  At your dads, although you may have to put up with some extra stress due to the fighting/helping, you'll learn a lot by debating/arguing with him and you'll mature much faster if you grow up helping other people. It sounds like a good family environment, too, even though there are disagreements.<br>  <br>  Not to call you out, but if you live with your mom, it might be interpreted as selfish.|`|KJt2KDKxaa	I don't know - that's a big decision. I mean on the one hand you have the religious issue with your dad  and on the other you have your brother and mom+boyfriend.  I would say maybe sit down and talk with them about it - perhaps with a counselor (they have them at school, etc) or some other mediator. You tell each parent what is going on that is bothering you.   See how it works out.  good luck|`|BJGWPTHRaa	i would not like 2 live wit ur mom because she has sex a lot dats wat my mom does with her husband and i hate it so i would live with ur dad!!! but it is up 2 u!!!|`|tManvxfQaa	well...seems its a not much of a choice...but you have to make one and only You know the situations.......i think you need to talk to someone...a counselor or someone YOU know who is doing right...and get some sound advice...and biblical if possible.
pQ1q1QUzaa	I'm not married but I know how it feels to not trust someone you love dearly. The problem with us women is that we are easily attached to someone who gives us any attention when our loved one doesn't. It doesn't have to involve sex or it's just the attention we receive. However, if both of you want to work things out then the show must go on. <br>  <br>  The first thing you both should do is realized that you made a mistake and forgive yourself. You must forgive yourself before you ask anyone to forgive you. After you do that then, you have to pray. Once you pray then leave that with your Higher Being. Then you must ask each other for forgiveness. Once you both forgive each other then you get out a piece of paper. On that paper you write out all the good things on one side and the bad things on the other side. Calculate each side. If the good out weighs the bad then you must learn to compromise and deal with the issue at hand. But if the bad out weighs the good then it is time to move on. Love is a complicated melody we all sing but we must learn to work through those complications|`|8kfmqxXSaa	couples therapy|`|gUXb103Maa	You cannot forgive and forget with this guy. This guy has to so many things with you and clearly does not like you much. Or he likes you noly for your looks. Try to go to some talk show and get help, but there only way for you is to get away from him. If you divorce, then he won't have much money to get drugs. Divorce for his own good and you safety. I don't want you to be a hobo. <br>  <br>   For another dramatic way is to do it in a pervertly fashion. Do what flirty people do and bring him to the bed. This is a sad way but can help. "Do it" it with him and make him feel really happy, and then tell him to stop drugs for more. Also, the baby will come and surely he won't be such an asshole to show a newborn child the retards of life. If he wants good for the baby, he would change.<br>  <br>  But if he's in debt, then he is screwed. BREAK AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Go find another lover who loves you for what you are and isn't an asshole. <br>  <br>  But it bet this scenario is all fake, if it was real. then you wouldn't bother asking for help in this cheap Yahoo Answers community, cheap except me.<br>  <br>  Second option is only good if he doesn't have AIDS and haven't cheated on you. Also, hope that he hasn't developed some new disease from all the drugs.|`|rVbY5qBsaa	I understand what you're going through. My brother was a heroin addict and not until he was told he had to by the courts did he go to rehab and stick with it. There are times when I can't even look at him.<br>  I'm so sorry you had to go through it. Anyone who has ever dealt with a drug addict knows how terrible it feels. The betrayal, the pain and the broken trust. <br>  You were not wrong in the way you reacted. No one can go it alone. You are a very strong woman. Not many women would be faithful to their husbands when they were addicted to drugs. Not many women would be able to make it this far. So be proud of yourself.<br>  Not until people are in the same situation will they understand. Drug addiction turns the people you love into completely different people. They will do anything to survive. And being the brunt of it is one of the worst feelings in the world. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.<br>  However, you need to let go.<br>  It took me years to let go, but when you do, you will feel less tension in your heart. I can't exactly explain how to do it, but realize that it is over, there is nothing you can do about it. Definitely seek therapy. You've had to deal with enough on your own. Don't let pride get in the way of healing yourself.<br>  Good luck to you and take care of yourself.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	screw him!!! don't stay with him just because of your daughter<br>  thats screwed up she will think its normal to steal from each other as she gets older<br>  u need to be a good role model for her<br>  and find your self a good man someone who dont drink or smoke or do drugs

RDgyb7W8aa	Tell her off and don't care about anything she tells other people. Only one person you have to please and that is your husband. Just make sure you tell him what was said.
C6ee83Jbaa	well i personally HATE it when my man texts other girls, drives me crazy even though i KNOW i can trust him and that he's just being nice. so i don't know what it means exactly i would hope that it means that they are just friends and that he doesn't think of dating her in the future- especially when you're in a long term relationship like i am.|`|HtUhb3fXaa	It means he's a player. If he's saying 'so howd you do on the science test?' it's fine, but if hes saying 'hey hottie' thats not cool...and you shouldn't really text ppl of the opposite sex when u have a gf because text messages are private because you can watch someone text, but if u cant see their screen you have NO IDEA what they're saying!|`|DcqaZRoVaa	it could mean a lot of things<br>  1. he's bored<br>  2. he's friendly<br>  3. he just needs to talk something besides his guy friends and girlfriend. <br>  4. your just a really good friend<br>  5. he likes you. <br>  <br>  i doubt 5 though. texting is normal. unless he hung out with you more time than with his girlfriends, then you're getting somewhere.|`|fAmqCWDyaa	well it could mean that, even thouqh he hasz a qirlfriend, he wantsz you two to be close still (as in friendsz) or in some casesz it could mean that he has a little feelinqsz for you.|`|26033dd623d72c9ea1336e94364f12deaa	Depends on what he's saying to you. If he's saying thing's that he shouldn't be saying when he has a girlfriend then that's a bad thing. Someone's feelings could be hurt.|`|98YJhZ2qaa	wow people are dumb not you i understand. Anyway i think that he needs a friend or hes a player.<br>  <br>  wow there are alot of players in this world!|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	im not sure, but if he ends up cheating on his girlfriend to be with you then sont go there because he'll end up doing hte same to you|`|FRHkDEZyaa	soo he is ur friend right so u can text him like i have a girl friend and theres a other girl that i text they are both friends|`|HqG4MDxGaa	It means he's an a@@!

Or it depends on<br>  why he texted you.<br>  He might just be bored.<br>  Why don't you just ask him instead<br>  of asking us?|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	it depends on what he's saying. <br>  if he's making conversation, he's being friendly.<br>  if he's saying sexual/love type things, you should probably stop texting him back cause he just wants to get with you.|`|pOwOYqhEaa	it means that if he cant call you or you call him then he is at this point mentally cheating on his girl. And he cant be trusted.|`|e48iAjH3aa	he's being friendly.<br>  But if he's saying things to lead you on or sexual comments, then he's not a very good boyfriend, and you don't wanna<br>  be with someone like that, just imagine how much it would suck if you were this guys girlfriend and he was texting other girls.|`|zjf1volaaa	depends on how much he texts you and if he is always texting his gf too at the same time or one of his guy friends it all depends. if he is simply just texting you for conversation then its just a friend thing, if it is constantly then he probably likes you.|`|S852p6SXaa	it just means hes texting you. its okay for a guy to have a girlfriend  and have girl-friends. but if the his text messages become flirty or sexual then thats another thing, especially if hes keeping the conversations between the both of you a secret.|`|EfLEZaNqaa	either he likes you alot as a friend<br>  or he likes you too,<br>  because sometimes guys<br>  dnt care if thy have girlfriends,<br>  they'll still start to like other girls too.<br>  and if he doesnt breakup with her<br>  that still dont mean anything,<br>  that happened to me last year.|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	depends on what he's saying in his text. there's a big difference between friendly and flirty and you can tell. if he's being flirty, he sounds like a player.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	He is a cheat most likely.|`|52otNiElaa	That he's not the kind of guy you want to be dealing with.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well that dosent really matter he just wants to be friendly thats all
0GRWTQlDaa	see i can understand u had a bad relationship . ur still hurt it will take time to heal.i think ur very soft hart-ed person. ur very emotional person not a practical one. in life u have to move on.<br>  it's OKI u don't want to live with a man forever since u have lost trust in relationship. u have to be positive.<br>  see i have seen single woman & believe me it's really painful & lonely to die single. my cousin sister is 44 years old & i have seen her very sad suffering lonely. i don't wanna to scare u.<br>  i just like u to advice behave practically be patient .<br>  take time & think about ur life . what u want?<br>  if u were in a bad relationship that doesn't means u cant have a good relationship now.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I really doubt people are spending that much time trying to hook you up.  Just don't ask people to fill in for what a spouse will do for you... like take you to the hospital, take care of your dog, fix your broken toilet, look at your car  etc etc.  I actually have single friends who could be dead for months and no one would notice.  It is a responsibility I wish I didn't have to just check up on them and make sure they are not rotting.|`|c07v7O80aa	Until you can do without something, it's not worth much. In other words, not NEEDING a man actually makes it far more likely that you'll recognize the right man if he appears. And the bonus is that, if he doesn't (they don't always), you'll know you're just fine anyway. Having a spouse doesn't make you secure. Being able to care for yourself makes you secure AND it makes it possible to have a spouse for the right reasons, if it come along. My prediction is that if you set yourself up with a life and become secure by yourself, it will be obvious to the right kind of men that you're the best kind of partner. Congratulations. A lot of people never figure this out.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	I've been single 11 years and I'm now 44. I don't want to grow old by myself.  <br>  <br>  But that's me.  if you don't want to get hooked up, say so.  if they hook you uip, walk out.  They won't do it again.<br>  <br>  They want to hurt you to make themselves feel better???  What?????<br>  Humans are SOCIAL CREATURES.  Few of us can live by ourselves forever.   They want to see you happy with someone.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Don't let other people rule your life.  I tend to be on the quiet passive side too, but at some point you have to put your foot down and tell them to butt out of your life.|`|3iNobwVraa	It sounds like they are imposing their views/values on you because they care about you.  Don't get frustrated or mad.  Just respond to the part that really matters: they care about you.  <br>  <br>  When they try to hook you up, just say.  "No, I'm not interested.  Thank you for caring so much about me and my happiness.  It is because of this, that I am happy.  I know I can ask for your help if I want/need it, and that means everything to me.  I promise I will, if I need to, so lets not talk about this anymore."|`|de98ae9f767cca0cbce05bd146ac0d7daa	I have learned that You must not live your life to please others. You must do what YOU want to do. What is going to make YOU happy. Marrying a man to support you is a recipe for disaster. If he starts treating you like crap and there are children involved, you will make their lives miserable by staying in a miserable marriage because you don't have the money and education to fly on your own.  I suggest you get a job that is going to allow you to support yourself if you end up with an bad partner.|`|0e5aeac0b9db1edd4e79c50eed3109f2aa	You seem to be clear about who you are and what you want.

So what I feel is if you want to be independent, just tell them that, you know how to live and get one good job which helps you to be economically independent. In my opinion, girl wants a life partner and not life from partner. She also can survive without marriage or without anybody's help. I hope those ppl who want you to be secured doesn't have any selfishness. They are just caring you. Don't worry.

wseP86qSaa	If you are going to marry her, then make sure that you are absolutely, 100% accepting of her infertility. If you are not sure, then one day you might start to resent her, and that would be so unfair to her. Obviously she was open with you about it so respect her by committing to her or not. Make sure you know what you are in for. Research your options together, she will probably touched by you making that effort.|`|hnpw7xataa	Hi lizzy<br>  The is one hell of a deep question coming from you. There are things that no one can control and being infertile is one of them. Most guys would say it did not matter but it would be a lie and you and i both know it. Having a baby for the both of them is very dam exciting and so lovely to see her belly grow knowing that there is something inside we both made. But if she couldn't have children and we both where in deep love then why not marry here. I would think you were in love way before you found out she was infertile and if you love her you have to be able to accept her as she is. I would still marry her no matter what and hope for the best and enjoy her for what she is , the person i loved.|`|dxkWU1LAaa	This is a matter that requires much discussion before anyone enters into marriage.

The key is open and honest communication before the marriage so all is out in the open.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	If you cannot live with it you should not marry her.  It would not be fair to her or to you. There are plenty of ways you could have a baby. I was going to carry one for my sister a few years back. Find a surrogate. There is nothing wrong with adopting, being a foster parent or any of that. A child does not have to be yours for you to love them.|`|AA11292270	If it is critical that you have your own biological kids then I guess this is a dealbreaker.<br>  <br>  But...there is always adoption, in vitro, things like that.

If your sister was left to take care of you, and didn't, the best revenge is to let your parents know.<br>  <br>  Why was it dark - no lights?  <br>  <br>  Maybe you can get on the phone with a friend so you aren't afraid next time.  Sorry and I hope you're doing better now.|`|CSBvtkmlaa	She is your sister and you should not try to get revenge on what she did. It may not have been a good idea to leave you alone. But did you really need to be in the house by yourself? Where were your parents? You should just forgive your sister and not dwell on the past.

qGiFTnC2aa	I really hate it when people say "Just forget it, just walk away" because when you're truly in love it's more complicated than that. You can't just turn the feelings off.<br>  <br>  But.  I CAN tell you that getting involved with a married man isn't like falling in love with someone who is single and available.  In all likelihood it will fail, and if you want it to work then you have to be prepared to walk away and tell the man that if he wants you he'll need to sort his life out first and then get in contact but you won't be around to help destroy his marriage.<br>  <br>  Is the man in love with you too, or do you just lust after him?<br>  <br>  At any rate, try to put some distance between yourself and him, as much as it hurts. Try to realise that by pursuing him you're not only ruining another woman's life (and possibly children) you're making his life harder and you're setting yourself up for hurt. And if he doesn't treat his wife with respect you need to know that it is possbile you could end up in the same boat down the track.<br>  <br>  I won't tell you not to be in love with him, but unfortunately you can't make it work right now.|`|hawq3Fneaa	Run the other way; there is no happy ending for anyone including you if you pursue this relationship.  You and he will hurt his wife and other family members if he does decide to get involved with you.  <br>  <br>  And you could look like a real fool if his feelings are not the same and he belittles you while he tells you he still loves his wife.<br>  <br>  If you do end up together, there will always be a trust issue in the future during tough times because you both know you both cheated and ruined other relationships to be together.<br>  <br>  Think about how you will feel after you are married, and he dumps you for another woman.<br>  <br>  Be happy and let others be happy, stay away from this guy.  Do not get involved.|`|lvelp0CGaa	I have to agree with Janey she's hit the nail on the head.<br>  <br>  Walking away from any love is hard whether they are married , seperated , divorced , single , it doesnt matter which it is . In the end its the same brings pain and agony , it doesnt matter whether the person has kids with the spouse or not it will still end in disaster and pain for you moreso then him.<br>  <br>  Men do mourn the loss of an affair but women mourn worse and suffer harder .Please think this through very carefully not just about the pain the wife will suffer upon discovering you exist ( she will hunny I know she will I discovered the skanks my ex's cheated on me with ) .<br>  <br>  Just try and think with your head even though you know your heart will suffer good luck .|`|TTjDATeOaa	Depends on how they felt about me and if there were children involved.<br>  <br>  Well no children is good, but in this case, the only thing you can really do is to wait it out. Most marriages end in divorce, so if he leaves his wife, he's fair game, but it's not really appropriate to tell a married man about your feelings for him.|`|3iNobwVraa	Well, I'd say if you really think that's what you feel, you have to say something.  I wouldn't; I'd run away.  But, it's probably better to say something.  All the cards being on the table makes every situation easier to navigate, imo. <br>  <br>  No matter what happens, if you walk away, do so with dignity, kindness, and NO vindictiveness.  And, don't play victim.  Just learn what you can, and move on.  It will get better.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	If I truly loved someone who is married I would walk away because I would not want to break up his marriage.<br>  Geeesh!

If you were the wife in that relationship how would that feel to you? Why didn't you stop your feelings from developing into 'love' with this married guy when there are plenty of single ones around. Do you like the ones that aren't available better?<br>  <br>  There was a point when you felt these feelings getting inappropriate and you had a choice to make, next time you should consider making a different choice.|`|CHeHYwVNaa	Move far far away so I wouldn't have to face temptation.|`|thoMmZAvaa	I assume this person hypothetically loves me too? Then I'd let them know that when they're free of their marriage to contact me.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Under no circumstances would I even venture there in any way. First of all, if this person were to cheat on his marriage vows he would prove right there to be a snake. No way, shape or form could I come between two people in that kind of way. Whether or not children are involved, it wouldn't matter. A family dynamic should be formed with the two and I have no part of it. It would be disaster, and there are plenty of other people to love out there. <br>  <br>  Love is a strong emotion, no doubt. We have free will and can be good people and turn away. I had a married man tell me he was in love with me once, NEVER spoke to him again. There is more than one person involved, who am I to destroy, or even want to destroy a union of marriage.<br>  <br>  I really am adverse to people who cheat and to people who go after married people. It's wrong, no fine lines at all. None. No, "We just don't get along, I don't love him/her like I used to" stuff. Until they are divorced they have no chance.|`|M43M4KZxaa	the fact that the person is married will bring pain and longing on my part.what will i do but keep it until the right time comes.but if he is truly committed.i will gladly do the right thing.keep my distance.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Hopefully you would be the one married to the one you love and can't live without.

I agree that texting doesn't mean much. The only thing that would concern me is WHAT they're talking about in their texts. You know?<br>  <br>  Also, if you both want to get back together and you feel suspicious because of everything that's happened, I strongly suggest you talk to him. I don't know the girl, I don't know him, and I don't know you. I say this because I can't tell you if he really likes her or if he doesn't like her. Also talk to her, get her side of things.<br>  <br>  Most of the time people have a falling out because they're communication needs improvement, like patience, for example. It all really depends.<br>  <br>  You're asking if we would be suspicious if we were you? From what you've written, it does ring a little suspicious. Talk to him, girl. See how it goes.<br>  <br>  If he really wants to get back with you, he wouldn't be letting his feelings for someone else get in the way. It's a hard lesson I've learned myself. I hope it works out.|`|rB1bJAdtaa	No. <br>  Maybe she's just a close friend.<br>  I text my closest guy friend more than my boyfriend.<br>  Texting my boyfriend all the time gets annoying and I start to think he's getting clingy after a while.<br>  But my best guy friend, I can always talk to him.<br>  <br>  You're just jealous.|`|qSlh7ub9aa	If you guys can't be together  because of his parents, just let him go. Plus, texting is just texting. I don't think it's a big deal, unless they were like, sexting or something. It's okay to be jealous, but it's not like you guys are dating any more right?|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	yes I would and I would talk to him about it.|`|qlhDCAPyaa	i would leave him.|`|yu6Vb7SZaa	YES....she's clearly more than a FRIEND|`|Sg0JhS76aa	YES. he prolly lied to u to get to her
dFHsAXDMaa	hey sweety as a mother and cheering coach for local high school and a former teen (not all that long ago) I will tell you that this unfortunately is just part of life people grow up and change and friends come and go... your friend will be your friend again she is just going through this weird stage right now like wanting to hang out with popular girls or whatever... the one thing I do not understand is why teens now a days feel like they can only have one friend when I was younger there were like 10-15 girls always hanging out together and it was fun.. maybe that girl Sarah told you your friend was going over in hopes of you saying cool can I hang out too? talk to your friend and tell her you miss her and spending time together and that you do not care if she has a million friends but that you guys have been friends for too long to just all of the sudden mot be friends anymore.. tell her how you feel that you would like to hang out with them all too and get to know her other friends... good luck|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	let her know how you feel and if she keeps lying to you, then she's not worth having around. it's bound to happen one day, people drift away from each other all the time, that's just life. there will be others.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Aww, I'm sorry but maybe you do need to make new friends. Ask her to your house to cathc up, and stuff. And confornt her about ling, because that's wrong.|`|3H0hluVoaa	Here, I am almost sure that she still likes you. I am sure of it. Invite her over, the best way to keep your friend is to invite them over since you can really connect.<br>  Ask her about it make sure before you assume that she doesn't want to be friends.<br>  She is still your friend. Remember this, don't press her to go over your house she may feel unconformable but it may be that she had already answered to someone else, try to ask her to come over as soon as possible. But remember she may feel she has an obligation to other friends if you ask her too often.<br>  It could also be possible that the others like Sarah may be lying to you instead of your firend or maybe they are insisting on her coming over.<br>  <br>  Do not give up on her. Just because she is not coming over doesnt mean she doesnt want to be friends.  Think carefully. Was there any event, any event at all that may have caused this?<br>  <br>  Dont give up, I am sure she still wants to be friends.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Im glad things worked out. Its good thing you can talk to her easily since youre close not many can talk about serious problems with their firiends like that. Good job.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if youre looking for things to do I can name plenty. I have a long list of things to do in my spare time which I dont have much. Maybe you should make a question of that too. :D Ill be glad to answer it.|`|8GjVihl8aa	i'm sorry you have to go through that, but another thing you have to look at is that you shouldn't let yourself get treated the way she has been treating you whether she is your only friend or not. <br>  <br>  One thing it may be is that she just wants something different. i'm assuming you are in middle school or still young or something and maybe she is just tired of you and you always being around. just like how she talks bad about sarah she could just the same be talking bad about you. <br>  <br>  i suggest you make new friends. i know easier said than done but its the best. you don't have to necessarily be close to them, but have acquaintances. i know building a friendship is hard and takes time to build that comfortability and trust so don't feel pressured or rush into anything. another thing you might want to do is just talk to her, tell her the truth and how you feel. <br>  <br>  :)
gj1rzc4Gaa	ik what you mean <br>  i kinda feel like "84" is embarrassed to say shes friends with me when shes with her dance friends  so when i talk to her on like aim or facebook and shes with them shell say mean things or sometimes you wont even be talking to her, it will be one of her dance friends and they say mean things|`|HT1ar9m4aa	I'm sorry. This is what we in my day is the brush off. Plus, when my son was dating some of the girls he dated were domineering, they wanted to wear the pants in the relationship. I'd hate to see the wimps they marry. When a partner start acting this way its time to end it, keep it like a long distant relationship and don't go out of your way to go see her. Some relationships are not destined to be and if you stayed her friend she can strip you of confidence in who and what you are. Every aspect of life, whether it be Relationships, Work, Family and relatives, can effect other aspects. So don't give away your independence to be you, be yourself and don't be around people that want to tear down You.  Have a great evening, Julie|`|btRb6kS5aa	You don't need a friend who is going to dominate the relationship. What you need is a friend who will stand next to you, be an equal, and never laugh at your problem. In order to be successful in life you can't have people who make you feel small. You need friends who love you, will do anything for you, and be incredibly supportive. She is not a real friend if she acts bi-polar, cares about some dance crew more than you. You know where her loyalty lies and with that you need some one who you can trust and who will trust you.

Don't get me wrong, I would change anything if I could go back in time.<br>  <br>  My life right now is perfect. I love my wife and wouldn't change a thing.<br>  <br>  The real reason to get married should be because you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. There is way to much divorce.

Movie are soo old school and boring. i like variety and movies and dinner wouldn't please me. Cook her a homemade meal, rent a few movies (not sappy love movies[unless you like that stuff]), talk for a while and light a few candles.

xcxMB4Rlaa	I don't think you're being a bridezilla at all.  It's not as common now as it was before, but there was a time when the bride had all her bridesmaids wearing the exact same hairstyle.  Now that's bridezilla behavior.  I was in a wedding like that.  I didn't complain for two reasons.  First, it wasn't my wedding.  Second, she was paying for it.  So as long as she didn't request anything outrageous (like cutting it into a specific hairstyle or changing my color) I was okay with it.  <br>  <br>  With that in mind, I think you have two options.  As your best friend, you should have a close enough relationship to be able to be honest about your feelings.  Be honest, but don't be mean.  And explain to her that her current hairstyle does not match the level of elegance you'd like for your wedding.  If you're lucky, she'll laugh and tell you she has plans for getting her hair done for the wedding.  If not, your first option is to scrape up some pennies and pay for her to have her hair done on the day of the wedding.  Make sure she knows you're not trying to change her, just enhance her look for the day.  Since she's not paying, she probably won't object.  You can even show her pictures of the hairstyles you have in mind so she can feel comfortable.  Your second option is to let it go.  You accept that this is your girl and just hope that she has a plan to do something with it the day of the wedding.  And more than likely, you won' even notice her hair on the wedding day because you'll be so blissfully happy it won't even matter.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Do you care more about your friendship or her hair? You do sound like Bridezilla. Then again, she sounds stubborn too, simply because she feels she is being forced to do what you want her to do. Since you said you have no money to pay for a professional cut for her, you can either have her step down from her MOH position and risk losing a friendship  or let it go. On the wedding day, that will be the last of your concerns.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I see what youre saying, but I dont think its as big a deal as you imagine it is. You want everything to be perfect, so you focus on details and they might get blown out of proportion in your mind. Truth is, your guests are not going to look at her and think "That bridesmaid!" They are going to be looking at you, and when they see her they will just think she has bushy hair, thats all.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	Yes, I'm sorry but you are in the wrong here. Your friend cannot help that her hair is curly and thick and that you don't like the way it looks. If you cannot afford to get her hair done, you can't expect her to spend money on it herself (even for a cut)! <br>  <br>  Do you honestly think that your friend is going to roll out of bed, throw her dress on and go to your wedding? Of course not! She'll brush her hair and do something with it. Don't sweat the small stuff! Just because it's *your* wedding and it's supposed to be all about you doesn't mean that everyone else's life goes on pause -- that's more directed at some of the other answerers.<br>  <br>  If you're really concerned about it, set up a night with all your bridemaids (or just a bunch of friends) for eating junk food, watching movies, and doing hair and makeup on eachother! Have a hair straightener, styling gel, hair clips, etc and just have fun. This way, you're not singling out your MOH and if someone comes up with a really good updo you can say "hey, I really like that! you should do that for my wedding." See, not so insulting, not expensive at all, and will calm you down a bit!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|frA6KJwIaa	i understand how you must be feeling and i do not agree with these other people on here saying that you are a bridezilla! i wouldn't want my maid of honor to look bad on my wedding day cause she is going to be in all of the group pictures right!<br>  so i think you should try to scrape up some $ to get her hair fixed a little, even if u may be tight, since she doesn't wanna do anything. or just tell her how you feel. u want everyone to look their best and polished for your day. i know she might take it the wrong way though, but i feel like she should understand! i'm sorry, but i don't know what else you could do!|`|qKbwBYRTaa	Well I am going to disagree with all these people calling you a Bridezilla. You are being sane! This is your wedding you do not want someone to look like a freak or a a dirty person who hasn't showered or can't take care of themselves. I think for your wedding day, you need to tell all your bridesmaids that you would like their hair a certain way, that way you are not singling her out. You are spending all this money on your wedding and your pictures. You want them to look good! You do not want to look back at your pictures and notice her hair every time you look at them. All I can say is on your wedding day when everyone is doing their hair, say you would like their hair a certain way. If you are paying for their hair, then you can definitely do that. If not, ask her if she could possibly make it look good for your wedding since she will be standing in front of your entire family.|`|GQsDlFtzaa	Unless you are paying for her hair leave her alone. It is HER hair not yours.  Would you like it if some one came up to you and said your hair looked like crap? Why are you letting hair get in the way? The last thing guest will be looking at is your maid of honor. You are the one they came to see not her.|`|HoXhuqrEaa	You are right! Its your day and your friend should understand you want everything to be pretty. You have to pay for pictures and I understand yyou do not want to look at hair that annoys you. She should understand it is your 1 day you are not bridezilla.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	Calm down, Bridezilla.  Forget about her hair.  I'm sure she'll make herself look presentable on the big day.<br>  <br>  Until then, you're worrying over nothing.  If her hair looks crazy and zany come wedding day, THEN b*tch about it.|`|dHPA390Qaa	Her hair isn't going to look bad on you.<br>  This is so trivial it doesn't matter.  She is your friend no matter what.<br>  I think you should drop this topic with her and show her how much you appreciate her as a friend.|`|4Hv0i2Y8aa	It is HER hair and the decision as to how she wears it is up to her. even if you were paying for someone to do her hair professionally for the wedding, you'd still get no say in what she does with it until then.<br>  <br>  She's exactly right on one point: Very few people will be looking at her. I doubt anybody will be saying, "Everything was SO lovely, but that MOH's hair just looked wrong." <br>  <br>  Ask yourself what is more important: Having everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) look nice and perfect for one day, or having this woman in your life? If it is the latter, then just suck it up and get over it. If it is the former, then I fear maybe you don't deserve her as a friend. <br>  <br>  To value the aesthetic appearances of a one day event over lifelong friendships is petty Bridezilla behavior.|`|BAlntsndaa	Don't let the stress of your wedding ruin it by worrying about someone else's hair. If you can't pay for the bridal party to go for hair appointments to dress them for the wedding, how about adding feathers or florals as hair decoration to take attention from the girlfriend's hair? It's still six weeks until the wedding and many things can change. Enjoy her goofy hair, no one else really cares so do not let stress focus you on such a minor detail. If you say anything, tell her she'd look so cute if she would just get her hair styled while it grows out. And if she asks if you are saying it's ugly - yea! You guys are friends right? Can't you just tell her that the dress looks so amazing on her that with the right haircut she'd be competition for the most beautiful? Then let it go and enjoy the day.|`|EJMwqU3caa	First of all, I'm hoping that your friend knows that her hair needs to look appropriate for the occasion, and that she's not planning on going for the just-rolled-out-of-bed look!    Maybe try calmly and kindly asking her what kind of style she's planning on doing for your wedding.  Maybe you can bring some ideas to her that you think that she might like and have a "mock-run" with her.  That way you can be at ease that she will have it styled nicely for your special day.  Try asking her at a time that you haven't been 'bothering' her about how it currently looks.  <br>  If that doesn't work, tell her to buy a fancy wig!!!!  lol! :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|iDfRTLklaa	Get over your self, a wedding is not all about the pretty pictures.  A wedding is about two people declaring their love for one another, and making a commitment to each other.  I wouldn't care if my maid of honour shaved her head before my wedding, she is my best friend and I couldn't imagine getting married without her at my side.|`|e2bc9d6d80cd30940315e03dcd764fd3aa	If you could pay to have her get it trimmed, you should. Otherwise, suck it up.|`|9PaRdlwcaa	She should understand that it's your sedding pictures that you'll have to look at for the rest of your life, and if she has gotten it cut before, she could do it again, and then after the wedding, she can go back to "letting it go". Try to be sensitive, but let her know that you really like how it was before.|`|YQoG8jVtaa	My maid of honor died her hair hot pink two weeks before the wedding! Luckily my colors were pink and green ;) But seriously if she really does look ridiculous, she will be the one that looks ridiculous- not you. It will not shine badly upon you either, we are all unique individuals and your wedding guests know that.|`|YxAh57jiaa	In my opinion i dont think your being a bridezilla - i would be annoyed in your position there arnet many things you can do if she is stubborn <br>  1.Ask your husband to be opinion - its his wedding aswell plus he might know what to do because he not in your position ( if you get what i mean ) like an outsiders view <br>  2.tell her if she doesnt get her sorted she will not be apart of the bridal party <br>  3. let her have her hair messy - you'll be the bride all the focus will be on your dress and the happy couple anyway<br>  <br>  congratulations and good luck !<br>  <br>  xx
ba0d5ff814e4de743ed883cab2a57206aa	About 2 weeks before the wedding, get another person that she is friends with <br>  to say something like...Gee, she must really be a good friend to let you mess<br>  up her wedding pictures with hair like that."<br>  or<br>  I am glad you are not in my wedding with hair that looks so bad. I think you <br>  looked soooo good with your hair short.<br>  <br>  Either way, she will know how she looks and if she is really a good friend<br>  will take the hint. <br>  If not, then you know she likes her self more than you.
AikAMGQaaa	Because they CAN!|`|mefxIQP9aa	I associate older guys with seriousness. Like younger guys are very immature and just want to fool around. They don't want to settle down, have kids, get a career, buy a house...they're not thinking about that.<br>  <br>  But that's just me.<br>  <br>  A lot of girls go out with older guys because they have more experience and can easily sweet-talk their way into the girls pants. Young dudes have no experience. Girls also believe that the older guys will take care of them.<br>  <br>  Lots of girls are so dependent and clingy now-a-days. They have no back-bone at all.<br>  <br>  Older guys aren't more mature...they just have more experience in the game.|`|G0KEMulSaa	ive noticed that too<br>  last year when i was a freshman<br>  this girl that i met and became friends with started to date a junior<br>  (and btw this girl had skipped 8th grade, so she shoulda been in 8th grade not 9th)<br>  shes still with him, shes a sophomore and hes a senior. idk why that happens.|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	Guys who go out with freshmen<br>  don't really like them. They only<br>  want one thing from them so that<br>  makes the freshmen girls stupid<br>  and naive.

Some guys are very sweet and mature but some others are just too concerned with their friends rather than their girlfriend.|`|LGCLmUTnaa	It's because girls mature faster than guys, so older guys have the same amount or more maturity than younger girls.|`|4THbLmvoaa	Girls like guys with experience.. they like it when guys make the move and feel like older guys know how.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	It probably makes them feel more important or wanted or mature, etc.|`|2gsLd2Ybaa	because younger guys have a reputation 4 being, well young....<br>  <br>  not grown up and mature..<br>  <br>  were as older guys are more manly lol...|`|briRpzL1aa	Because guys mature slower than girls do...|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well younger guys act dum so thats why girls like your age like to date older men|`|W1T91aEcaa	For the most part, girls mature faster than boys and so they feel like they are more with an equal (as far as maturity goes) when they are with an older guy. When I was a senior I started dating a guy who was almost 21. I just felt more comfortable with him than I did with other guys. He was more at my level of things. Also, girls like to feel protected and often times, an older guy makes them feel like that, more so than a guy their age or younger. Personally, I would never date a guy younger than me. The thought of it just weirds me out. Even if a guy is just a couple of days younger than me, I see him more as a friend/younger brother than a potential boyfriend. Some girls are different though.|`|bFDeOXvYaa	Girls generally mature faster than boys, so girls dating the older boys are because their level of maturity is more suited to their own, whereas dating a younger boy the difference in maturity is much greater.|`|w7d2H3vzaa	well im 13<br>  and my boyfriend is 16.<br>  i like older guys because the guys in my grade is sooo immature, and i want some adventure, somthing new|`|38tvGsqkaa	pshh!<br>  my ex was a year younger than me.<br>  and my current is a year older.<br>  the younger one was more spontaneous, and i really liked that.<br>  so to be honest, i prefer younger or same age.|`|N5Yx86sYaa	Because, girls are more emotionaly mature than boys, so to a 14 year old a 17 year old looks better than a fellow 14 year old|`|kqaZWgj2aa	From a girl's point of view:  younger guys are f***ing retards.  I find that when I date older guys, they seem to be around the same maturity level as I am at the time.|`|FUzemZS5aa	yeah , i think its cause girls mature faster than boys , so a younger boy might be a little immature and inexperienced.|`|iRhb7DPsaa	cus guys dont really babysit so they can be seen with a younger girl but, girls do so if a girl senior is datin a guy freshman it would seem like her cousin that she is baby sittin|`|HtUhb3fXaa	BECAUSE IN MOST CASES guys are more immature than girls.

vHjYw1txaa	If he is being abusive, then you should push her to leave.  Women die everyday from abuse.  It is important for her to understand this relationship is abusive, when your in the situation you seem to turn a blind cheek to everything and you don't see it as abuse until your out of it.  There are programs that can help her.  But she has to first want help.  The abuse hot line can provide her with shelter and support.<br>  <br>  Tell her parents if she is close with them, they can legally have something done in most states.|`|aXYiOskmaa	good lord, where's her family? haven't they stepped in yet?<br>  this is why 16 yr olds should not have children. it's obvious she can't make good judgments if she thinks this guy is worth fighting for.<br>  you were very right in telling her that leaving is a good thing. as friends, we have to take those kinds of chances sometimes. regardless of the outcome. we can't just sit by and watch it happen. however, you've said what you needed to and now it's up to her. she has to make the secision by herself. i just hope she doesn't lose the babe because of his abuse.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	honey, you can't not make her do anything, she is the one who have to leave on her own and at the moment she is not ready <br>  what you can do it to listen to her (that is if  you can bear it ) <br>  tell her you will be their for her if she needs a friend <br>  that is all <br>  I was just on the phone with a friend that has endure so much B.S and still stay and in 1996 the doc told her that she was hiv + while pregnant you think that she would have left NO in fact she stays and thing has not gone better but worse because he is still abusing her <br>  and to top it all her chidlren are doing thing but she wakes everymoring to make breakfast for her 16 years who will not even wash a dishes <br>  and at 16 is following in his father footstep the girl is 23 she is worst <br>  so some people have certain mentallity they need the abuse (sad ) but true|`|wseP86qSaa	Take her away on a long vacation until she starts to see things clearly. She's addicted to him like a drug. At first she'll be going through withdrawl and want nothing but him, but after that she'll start to see him for what he is. In the long run she'll thank you.|`|oB4KxwuJaa	Please help her.  If you even have to find her somewhere else to stay please do so.  This is a serious matter.  Get her out there before it is too late.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Well, of course, you were right in telling her to leave him!!!!<br>  <br>  Many abused girls and women refuse to leave their abusive husbands for many reasons.    I think the important thing is to be there for her, to tell her there is help out there.  Look up women's shelters in your area and give her the phone number.  They can help her start a new life.<br>  <br>  Also, what about calling the police when you know she's being abused?  What about her parents helping?

Everyone has to practice to perfect something.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	According to Dr Phil, if the sex is good the percentage of importance is low.  If the sex is bad, the percentage is high. Apparently, it is very important to you and it's bad. This is not a divorceable action; you need to communicate and teach him, that is IF you love him enough. If you don't care to be bothered, let him go.  Good luck.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	It plays a very important role. <br>  Communicate to find out what the problem is.  If that fails, surprise each other.  Do things like what you did when you were dating.  In the car, at the beach, in the kitchen, at the back of the movie theater if you get my drift.  .|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I don't believe is grounds for a divorce you can always let and show the other person know what you like and how you like it.

If after working on it you still aren't satisified, then you may want to seek professional advice.<br>  <br>  Not being satisfied sexually in a marriage can RUIN your relationship and could most definitley lead to divorce.  But I think it's something that two people have to work on together ... really work on ... before you totally give up on the marriage.|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	Well it's important but i only know one kind of sex with my wife ands that the missionary position so i don't know good from bad sex<br>  <br>  I'm bored with it but no divorce.|`|y21VcTjDaa	When the intimacy isn't there then you start to feel like just room mates...that's not what marriage is supposed to be like...then resentment sets in...not a good scene.
F32uPjAraa	Are you saying that the one you love the most is not normal?|`|tK5swgX1aa	I'm not a very huggy person honestly. I hug people I love, like family members, children and close friends or loved ones.|`|TKf6z1vHaa	A hug equivocates a lot of things to me. I hug my family and friends because I love them and I am happy to see them. I hug a bf or date to express my feelings and interest in them. Hugging to me is a way of expressing emotion that words cannot describe; it makes you feel so happy and good inside and it connects you with the person you are hugging. Hugging is also a form of comfort. When I am feeling sad, a hug is something that I long for b/c it is something that expresses the support and the reassurance that everything is going to be okay. <br>  I love hugs!! They're the best!!|`|AB5erhhUaa	It means so much more than people think that it does, it means sharing your body with the one you love.  Long and tight hugs are the best, you usually can feel alot.|`|QoS8ChCnaa	If its my best friends(that are girls) we do two armed hugs quickly.<br>  If its a friend that's a guy its just a simple one armed hug.<br>  And with my boyfriend, its two arms long hugs (: which I absolutely adore; makes me feel protected<3|`|c9f676588616bf588f7dfd5b30f60d96aa	When u hug someone such as a friend its usually quick and no body heat is exchanged, with someone you love u actually feel that body head and it brings comfort and joy.|`|hn3qLpXJaa	oh it feels so good to be held.<br>  my idea of a hug is my chance to feel held if only for a moment. the longer it lasts the better.<br>  <br>  its a physical release, a support, a need and a sign of affection. and i think most people can tell between one that's real and one that's not. thumbs down to fake hugs.<br>  <br>  ....I need a hug.|`|K2KBgy3Maa	if you feel all special during the hug and its longer than usual and feels right, you're in love. otherwise, you're just friends or something. it expresses love or friendship to me.|`|qSlh7ub9aa	Usually hugs with friends are like thank you's or hi's. Hugs with family, to me, are like "we've been through a lot, but we're still together strong". Hugs with boyfriends make me feel like they care about me and I can go to them whenever I need them.|`|9AI4TECmaa	my boyfriend and i hug long and close, so i love and adore it. with friends it usually a quick simple 1 arm hug.|`|LtZ064eoaa	that's like crossing a kiss with a hand shake to me lol but if your with someone you like or love the hug is different like long kissy kissy feeling and touch rub type of hug you know|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	I honestly have no idea what the question was, but I prefer hugs over kisses...?|`|6Tw5bxXPaa	My ex and I hugged long and close. I loved it.<br>  <br>  Most of the time like with my friends they're quick, one armers.|`|5fSXHdeBaa	I have never hugged my boyfriend but OMG, I would die if he did. I extremely want him to|`|HpKKD7xKaa	Friends are different. We see them almost everyday, depending on where we live and work, they listen to us when no one else will, we're just comfortable around them, and long hugs are not necessary in a friendship. However, when you are with someone you know you want see in while or perhaps someone you care deeply about, you stand against his/her chest a little bit longer just to breathe in the smell and to embrace that moment as long as you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also in certain situations hugs can change. If someone you know is in mourning you hold them tight and comfort them.|`|vU3IMRIIaa	I think a hug can mean a lot. I hug all my friends, not a passionate hug like I give my husband, but a nice " how have you been" hug. Maybe after being with this person for so long you have developed feelings for them and you need to address them to see where it will lead. Maybe that person feels the same way and that could explain the sudden "chemistry". :-)|`|HtUhb3fXaa	When you hug your best friend its like you love her as a sister and you don't really think anything of it, then  you talk. If YOU hug a random person you're like 'you could be a creeper' but IF YOU hug your boyfriend its totally different...idk its just...awww|`|4UkyrTKZaa	I think Hugs can be as powerfull as a kiss or words.

bItFniLxaa	I think you should tell him that you really do love him and you don't think that it's healthy for him to act this way. Also,let him know that it makes you feel sad if you see him looking dirty and out of shape when you know what a handsome man he is. Tell him that you understand his personal issues but you do not belive that not showering, shaving or working out is going to help make the situation better.

5itFktgLaa	Yeah, I think you've got it round the wrong way. I go out with girls to have fun, no expectations at all. I think if a guy is expecting you to 'repay' them for buying dinner/paying for a movie, they're probably not worth going out with.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I think that you should only have sex with someone you actually want to have sex with. Otherwise, its just empty, mechanical, i daresay boring, and you'll probably feel terrible afterwards.<br>  <br>  Having said that, based on my looks and general experience, if i'm seeing a girl a lot (at least 3 times a week), prob 2 weeks tops. If I only see them occasionally, about a month. After that, I would be wondering as to whether she actually wants to go out with me or whether she is just using me for my car and cash.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	when guys gets older then there,s a lot more to dating then sex. if he really cares for you then he will wait until you both are married. tell him don,t worry your vagina will still be there when you both are married.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	I don't expect a woman to give anything up. Sex is an activity you share, not something that women do solely to appease their partners.

Furthermore girls are very complicated and confusing to me.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	she's just using you.....<br>  again when she's gonna meet another one she''ll dump you again|`|vKrWrhQeaa	maybe she means you need to be there more as a friend...that's why she dumped all her problems on you, cuz she considers you a friend she can trust|`|TKf6z1vHaa	She probably was waiting for you to make the move and ask her out. sometimes if guys take to long, us girls think they're not interested so we move on to someone that we know likes us. Ask her out. I am sure she will go out with you.|`|c9f676588616bf588f7dfd5b30f60d96aa	She probably thought u were a fixture.|`|LMfYodo6aa	ask her.|`|S1cEi63Qaa	She wants you....to be her bestfriend
NGz7R9enaa	I think you should just be happy that the two of you have rings. Yes he is supposed to buy it, but with having a new baby I can imagine that money is tight. The wedding ring I have was from walmart as well as my husbands. We put them both on layaway and he only put $80 towards them, I paid the rest. Who cares? You love each other, that is what matters. In the future for a 10th anniversary maybe he will be able to afford the ring of your dreams:) That is what my dad did for my mom, but it was their 20th anniversary.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	It all goes into one pot, my engagement ring came out of the settlement we got when I crashed the family car.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	It sounds like something that can be fixed in the future.<br>  I waited until our twenty-fifth anniversary for the diamonds I wanted.<br>  You can, in the future, when things are better change to a new ring that he can pay for.<br>  In the meantime he thought of it, and wanted you to have it, which check the money to pay for it came from is a minor point.<br>  The love the two of you share with your baby is the major point.|`|1KfbgBupaa	Generally when you're married you've got a joint account - in other words, his $ is your $ and your $ is his $, unless you've agreed otherwise.  I'd wear the ring and be proud to have it on.|`|dHPA390Qaa	When you are married everything is 'yours-mine-ours' . <br>  I can see where you would have liked it to have been given under more romantic circumstances though.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Well, you are already married so it really doesn't matter who bought the ring. If he couldn't pay for it than why do you feel hurt? I'm not trying to be rude so don't take it the wrong way but you married him knowing you didn't have rings and your money is his money and vise verse so it doesn't matter who buys what in the relationship. I hope you didn't tell him that it bothers you. It would probably make him feel really horrible.|`|b8fac288f95255af7dc35ecaf1615256aa	My finance picked out my ring and was making payment on it when tax time came around. I had more of a refund and so to make things easier, I paid the ring off. Around $2700. I didn't mind one bit because he wanted to buy me the ring and he did. Our money is mixed so it's ours. Be happy you got the rings to show that you are married now. In a few years, upgrade!!|`|iDfRTLklaa	I can understand why you are upset about having to purchase your own wedding ring, but I think the most important thing to focus on is all the blessing you have in your life.  You have a man that loves you, and a little girl I'm sure you adore.|`|IRbw06qAaa	Gosh I can feel you, my fiancee wanted to buy her own and I told her don't because you are right I am a guy and we do feel uncomfortable, well as any loving couple, not being able to give all the things in the world to our wives. If he loves you this is probably tearing him up because he wants to give you everything you want and wasn't able to see that smile he loves. This is what you should do tell him you love him and tell him the marriage you guys have is not based on material things but the love you guys have for each other, and the love that you all have is going to last forever longer than a ring or any gift. When I proposed to my fiancee I didn't have anything I just said will you marry me. And she still doesn't have a ring! That kinda hurts to say though.|`|QP46eVi4aa	hey it is both your money so it is like he bought so dont worry i have a engagement ring and i don't wear it i got him for my first mothers day to get a ring with my daughters birthtone as a new engagement ring meant more to me that it had her stone in it and so i would just ask him later to get you a journey ring or past present future ring <br>  <br>  but i would not worry i would be happy you have a wedding band<br>  <br>  and if this makes you feel better the one i am wearing right now i bought at walmart not long ago for 20.00 cause it is just a plain simple one that i decieded i wanted and we took it and had the preacher who marrie us to bless it and i am wearing it
2af29aae9cc6a52e678fd65413877688aa	I think you are just a independent person and like your space, and Just because you don't want to !@#$  his brains out doesn't mean you are not in love with him.|`|AA11292270	It's perfectly normal.  It just means you have a full and interesting life outside of the relationship--and that's a good thing!|`|bkgBLjuvaa	it just means... your busy .&. he isn't on your mind...|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	You guys have probably been together for a long time so this might be that there is still sparks in the relationship but not fire.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	that's a question only you can answer.  Search your heart and I think you will find you already know the answer.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	There is nothing wrong with that...it just seems you are comfortable in your relationship and have gotten used to respecting each others agenda. At the end of the day it seems the underlying philosophy in your relationship is that you both know you have each other.<br>  <br>  Does not mean you love him any less..it seems comfort it is with you and it seems healthy to me. Good on you...I am starting to adjust like this myself. My husband and my schedule are quite similar to the description you have given. The main importances is having respect, TRUST, understanding, and awareness. From what i can see...you do.|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	It means you live a good happy full life.<br>  Love and a good relationship is not about missing each other and being together all the time, it is more about being happy together and there for each other, and I am sure if some longer time sets you two apart you will actually miss him.|`|6mr4OjQjaa	It just mean that you guys need to dedicate more time for each other. You saying you loving him everyday is good but your feelings are fading. This can lead to an extramarital affair. And this can lead down to a road of divorce and heartbreak. I feel you need to make time for each other seriously, if you love him.

I am now i year 9.|`|5nseONR7aa	I have a lot of friends but they are always babysitting their baby brothers or sister. I know because sometimes I help babysit them|`|Mj8WcL4Maa	it's the quality that counts. your one is precious compared to others who claim they have lots of friends yet don't even know more than their names.|`|8Initt1aaa	I don't have much friends. People think I'm popular just by my appearance but this is what I'll probably be doing all night tonight and pretty much every Fri and Sat. night   Its pathetic = {|`|94cc9d6390750c50305b0c89481e389baa	i have a few but if you want friends just go out to places like the mall, concerts, cafes, parties etc.|`|lhrMI9f5aa	Yes I do. What you should do is socialize with others then you will make friends :)|`|HT4mGCl7aa	YEAH I DO MY 4 GURLZ AND MY THREE DUUDES AND MY LUV DANIEL!!!|`|Draugm5qaa	i have a lot of friends, <br>  but 3 or 4 who i spend all the weekend with.<br>  <br>  but work, school, and church are great ways to meet people.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|CdTe8MO4aa	trust me one good friend is better then none<br>  don't ever take your friend for granted<br>  life is too short <br>  maybe stop doing the same activity and find something else to do|`|mhp7JKMNaa	I have a good amount. Before I use to be with you, I always hung out with like the same 5 people every weekend. Then 1 of them and I, decided to make hella more friends. It worked. I have a ton of more friends now. Don't worry, you can make more friends. Just say hi to everyone you feel comfortable around, it will be bound to work. Just don't cling on them. Good luck!|`|QSQ2AsBdaa	I'm not popular but I have quite alot of friends.<br>  Friends from primary, friends from secondary (now), close friends, best friends, friends outside school, and friends I hug and say hi to..<br>  yeahh I got quite alot.|`|03b5f9141419ea0eae2aa5d9d3ea728baa	i just have a few close friends<br>  but they ditch me for their boyfriends all the time|`|QBQKxsNtaa	nope only 2 but one is not really my friend he owes me a lot of money. and the other she is always with her other friends|`|IbWBAwVPaa	I have 3 close friends, 2 dudes and one chick. Having a few good friends cuts way down on the 'getting sick of' factor. I was a much more social person in high school but this has its drawbacks. Lots of friends means not much time for yourself and more drama. <br>  <br>  ANYONE can get annoying if you hang around them too much. Maybe you and your friend just need some space. No matter how much you like or love someone you need time for YOU and for others you care about. <br>  <br>  So maybe it's time to do your own thing for a while. Instead of being worried about how many friends you have or don't have become 'friends' with yourself, so to speak! Then, maybe find some new friends after you've had time to think this over. Decide what it is you WANT in a friend then you'll know what to look for. There is no shortage of places to meet people. So go out, get online or whatever...the main thing is TALK to lots of people and you'll find friends. If you do what you enjoy you are likely to meet people with similar interests so keep this in mind. <br>  <br>  Maybe too the time has come to ditch this friend. If this is a nice person, take a break, get some variety into your life and maybe things will get better. If this is a really nasty, mean person though, consider letting this friend go! It's much better to have no friends than BAD friends. A friendless person can always find friends, someone with lousy friends is just going to find BS! Best of luck to you and your friend and best of luck finding some new ones. I hope this helps!|`|4Q4dZJHpaa	Not really,I used to but friends seem to come and go.I have a few close mates n really it is true what they say that its quality,not quantity that counts.Sometimes you see people who are really popular n have loads of friends but some are fake.real friends are few and far between|`|JZMfUDylaa	not a lot I got about 8 most people are back stabbers so it's best to have a few people that you can trust rather than being popular and having people who are not trustworthy|`|BxU2NBIKaa	whats the the quistion i have about 20 freinds 2 close ones eventully you just get knew freinds and your old freinds just say whats up|`|S1cEi63Qaa	None of your business|`|y0QllkEMaa	mostly just school friends and a few long distance ones. but it's been lonely lately...|`|T0KHIFgaaa	yeah, i have lots of friends.|`|Sofk2yO8aa	no i've lost a bunch of my friends over the last few months. its complicated...
S852p6SXaa	this is what you do, when hes trying to get some from his girl just bust up in his room unexpectedly and just start talking about random sh!t and all that. and keep on doing it until he gets it. but honestly i would ask what problem he has with your girlfriend. maybe hes just jealous or maybe hes liked her at one point and is mad about the fact shes going out with you and not him.|`|04F4149yaa	Why did you invite her over all the time? If you want to be intimate get a hotel room ^^<br>  <br>  And yes, he is ruining your relationship.|`|F32uPjAraa	Threaten to tell all his friends that he is gay unless he stops.|`|7PqwM6QXaa	yeah<br>  just beat the crap outta him lol<br>  dont you have a lock on your room?|`|X2FrjG8Laa	yea he is just let him know whats up|`|zjf1volaaa	Well I'm sorry about your girlfriends low self esteem. But nobody wants somebodies little brother walking in on them and their boyfriend having sex while they are naked regardless of what they 'look like'. That is just disrespect, your brother is a little asshole but most boys are and they grow up and mature lol Just get a lock on your door and deal with it. What do you want me to say? Kill your brother? Scold him? No, just grip your phone tighter from now on so he doesnt grab it from you. Your girlfriend has serious issues, she needs to lighten up. She sounds like an emotional mess to me. She does not need to be getting mad at you for what your brother does. Your brother probably knows she IS a ***** so he calls her out, he obviously doesnt want you with that girl so find somebody else. Thats all I can say. <br>  <br>  Lock your doors<br>  Grip your phone tightly while talking around your brother<br>  Tell girlfriend to lighten up/stop taking things so seriously|`|c9f676588616bf588f7dfd5b30f60d96aa	No you are ruining the relationship, get another roommate or buy a lock for your door, if it is that you share a room with your brother then get over it.|`|QYbeBVZpaa	Lock the door !! or is it that you get a perverse sense of pleasure out of him seeing you making love to your woman. It appears that you very little respect for your woman otherwise you would have put a stop to this from the start.|`|rNE7XAmgaa	Pretty much lol.<br>  <br>  If u guys really like eachother though, it'll make it.<br>  Plus, i wouldn't get super mad if my bf called me a *****, i'd just be like, What? lol.|`|LMfYodo6aa	Tell him to grow the hell up. He's acting like a 5 year old. Tell him you and your girlfriend deserve respect.|`|HZgjUguWaa	your ruining it ?  Sounds like it to me that & lack of respect & privacy can't you lock your door somehow?|`|2g1rxroVaa	I am not reading all that bro sorry|`|sqmHXmKDaa	he c*ck blocks alot|`|qlhDCAPyaa	i think ur brother is jealous of u|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	Yes, If you don't do something. And your brother pushes her to limits. She'll be insecure she'll dump you and probably never talk to you again. So you have to do something about. Find your brother weak part and attack him. He'll back away and be sorry for doing everything he did to you guys. I don't mean kill him but talk to him find out what hurts him the most and then show him how you feel when he is trying to ruin everything. And don't push your girlfriend to do things she doesn't want to do because it'll be easier for to do them willing when your not so pushy.|`|9PaRdlwcaa	Yeah, you could say that! He needs to grow up and respect you and your girlfriend. I would kill my brother if he did that, so props to you for having the self control not to kill him. What he needs to understand is that if he's going to live with you, there should be some boundaries. Big boundaries!|`|uaHzhUeoaa	yeah. really hate to say it, but it sounds like your brother is really ruining this. maybe if he had a gf of his own, he would both understand why this has to be respected and not have nearly enough free time to screw with you guys!  so, try to hook him up w/ someone?  :D|`|NuaXMa5waa	dude yea. he messing EVERYTHING up. just punch him, and be like "knock it off you little ****" then if he doesnt go to her place?<br>  but yes he is screwing everything up, if i was her i would be soooo mad!|`|cmK9Go1gaa	Yeah, make sure he backs off, but remember for the most part, you don't want to ruin your relationship with your brother all together, so be nice about it.|`|hBjdQ379aa	you're giving him too much control and you're to blame because you won't set ground rules and consequences that won't interfere w/ your relationship|`|Sp5zcBLyaa	YES, but you can change the outcome of your brother outbursts <br>  just defend her and be Macho style. Girls love gentlemen.|`|Sma3ekSOaa	Yeah he really needs to stop because you will end up losing her!|`|H5tvzBoGaa	most definitely.<br>  he's a prick|`|pCOkTBA0aa	I think so. That is bad.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck for the future with your girl. =].|`|h9TQxlVpaa	Im not reading all that.|`|dEO34fvYaa	not sure, but it seems your brother is really jealous. You should talk to him about it.|`|oQt9oceuaa	yeah he is, how old is he? try to spread a rumor that he's gay ,proof, he doesn't like girls being naked,(straight men do of course). hehe! :)|`|6eJMKZXfaa	yeah, just kill him.|`|tfO69Y1Haa	Is this your older brother, or younger brother?<br>  He's obviously hurting your relationship, because she's getting fed up with it. Is he ruining it? No. But you should talk to him about it and make sure he understands that he can't do that anymore, otherwise you may experience even more difficulty with your girlfriend.|`|se3EnpZqaa	how old is your bro, because i have this pic of a ten year boy in my head?if he's old enough u need to talk to him. maybe theres a reason behind his action. I would definitly set some rules too.|`|IJGmNQs8aa	do not live with him anymore. He is jealous and ruining everything.|`|4wUflrBWaa	i would say so. could you ask to have your own room? move out? put a renters lock on the door (chain lock)? torture him? lol dont|`|FvJVRRfFaa	just destroy or hide the water gun...|`|x8loZIvEaa	it sounds like hes not helping it much.  try talking to him seriously|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	Tell your girlfriend you like her boobs not ask her to get new ones.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, he is ruining your relationship.  You need to threaten to him somehow.
70xZdTJfaa	Great conversation skills essentially come down to two thing:<br>  <br>  Showing interest and listening. People crave these two things. Show interest by asking open ended question. Listen by looking at the person and throwing in a comment here or there.<br>  <br>  A quick way to catch up on what people are talking about, is to scan the news paper every day. You can also go to a tv series review and get the gist in about 5 minutes.|`|0klCX1Ogaa	Whoo, they like anime and manga. I like your new friends already. =P<br>  <br>  Anyway, I don't think this is a case of improving your conversation skills. It's more you not knowing what's going on. I find it hard to believe that they always talk about things you don't know about so you should just take part in the conversations you can include yourself in. And if you're really bothered about it, ask them to recommend some good anime series to watch. Trust me, you'll enjoy it and they'll ask you your opinions on it.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	just talk about other stuff too. like if there's something that they're talking about that reminds you of something else then that's a good conversation starter. how about talking about music? that's fun right?|`|AA10702820	Ask questions about what they're talking about. Or start up a conversation about something you like and ask them if they like it too. Then you'll be able to talk something you know.<br>  <br>  To meet more people at your school start conversations with other kids in your classes. Ask them a question about the work in class or compliment them. Then you can start a conversation with them from there. Just don't be shy! Just be yourself. :)<br>  <br>  'Hope I helped!!<br>  <br>  Oh and can you please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnMD9Q8ZHYOiOpFu5fMoBmDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304161157AAmtK5v">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
dFHsAXDMaa	No it is stupid and immature and gets you Nowhere.. what a good friendship or relationship than do not play games just talk about what is bothering you with the person..all part of growing up and being in mature relationships and friendships|`|93r3nCM1aa	No. Silent treatment just fosters bitter feelings until one of you breaks the silence.<br>  <br>  You could avoid days or weeks of anger and resentment simply by breaking the silence before it starts, and just talking about things in the first place.<br>  <br>  Ever notice that whenever you give someone the silent treatment, nothing gets resolved until one of you starts talking? The silence doesn't do anything. Talking does.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, it works and it really breaks my heart if one of my female friends does that to me.|`|YHMvi106aa	No. I gave a friend the silent treatment because she always tagged along with me and my friends.

784H1Qujaa	What your mom says is untrue in Sudan rape is always happening but it is seen as the girls fault. You know that if you get raped in some places you could be forced to marry the man. You should never travel alone and never with someone that doesnt have the same reservations as you do. Alway travel with a male family member or an older adult female!|`|2hcA3VP9aa	i think the reason no one took it seriously is because you told them that he was a kid your age. if you would have told them he was an older guy, then they would have took it more seriously. another reason they might not have cared is because he made no real physical advance to you. but like i said before the main reason your family might not have reacted the way you wanted is because you told them that "the man was your age" and that is why they probally said he was just playing. i hope this helped and i hope that this does not scare you for the rest of you life because that would be awful.|`|bdeymNvHaa	You have every right to be angry.  How dare they laugh at your situation!  That was very scary and I'm so glad you handled it as well as you did.  I think he wanted to shake your hand so he could get your hand and pull you to somewhere where he could assault you.<br>  <br>  I think your family members may have been taking it too literally when you said he tried to rape you.  Technically, they may have been thinking the guy didn't take his pants or yours off.  If you hadn't been so smart and aware of what he was trying to do, you could have been raped.  Then none of them would be laughing, would they.   <br>  <br>  LOL - I've lived in TX 16 yrs now - I just noticed that part of your post - and although I feel much safer here, than in CA, I taught my kids to be aware of "strangers" because bad people can be anywhere.|`|c2fb4365c45b260693539c9ad4af6fd1aa	Well, I don't know if you were almost raped or not. It doesn't seem logical that he would ask if you want sex. I mean rapist don't ask, they take.I really don't think he planned to rape you, but in that situation you just don't know, you did the right thing by running from him. I'm not sure how old you are now, but it's time to either let this go and forgive your family, or go into counseling to deal with what happen to you and their reaction to it.|`|qawYlIjkaa	That is very disappointing and im am so sorry, they should have cared a mother should care go online and find a pedophile website type in your location and you will find at least 20 around where you live show this to them type in the location of where you were at age 12 you might see the man as one of the pedophiles try to get news about things similar to your case that has happened around there just because America has pedophiles doesn't mean another country cannot. You have a right to be angry, just know when or if you are a parent that you shall watch over your kids, and protect them.
NTC6g8hYaa	He didnt immediately sit next to you because even thought he likes you, he didnt want the embarassment of you not liking him and you thinking it was wierd. So ya he had his friends help you out cause obviously he wanted to but was a little scared. That happens to guys when they are nervous around or intimidated by you. So keep talking to him and ask him if he likes you. Good luck!|`|XfXRFCtcaa	boys are WEIRD that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  my advice: be particulary guarded. draw HIGH guide lines (to physical contact, dress modestly etc.) so that he likes u for ur personality - NOT for ur body<br>  <br>  cause that just leads to disaster|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well i think he wanted to be a gentlemen but ye he likes you|`|fLMc72q4aa	I'd say he probably likes you.  Maybe he's unsure whether or not you like him.<br>  His friends probably are in on it.|`|6sjH8fMcaa	if he did not want to sit next to you then he most likely does not like you. his friend wanted to switch seats so he could be with the other girl. <br>  but he could have asked his friend to move seats so he could sit with you... but idk i don't know if the other girl and boy liked each other or not.<br>  <br>  it depends how long you have known him. if that's all you have to say about the night then i doubt he likes you.<br>  but he might just be shy. ask him. if he does not like you then big deal. go after someone else.|`|PhgrcQ3Zaa	he might be nervous.<br>  maybe he wanted you to want to sit by him first.<br>  i dont know if his friends are in on it..<br>  but he might like you.<br>  after all he did invite you to the movies.<br>  maybe you should just tell him how you feel..|`|98YJhZ2qaa	He likes you and i think he was to nervous to sit next to you and his friend probably knows so he made him sit next to you. Do you get it???<br>  And that sounds like a Double date to me.|`|x8Bqf47Jaa	He was just doing something that most guys do, lol maybe confuse u a bit but then show u he likes u!!! Im pretty sure he does bcuz he did want to sit by u, he prolly told his friends so they could help out,|`|HtUhb3fXaa	THIS WAS PROBABLY precordinated lol...he wanted to seem like the gentlemen and let ladies first, then he got his friend to switch with you so in the end, you're next to each other! smart kid!|`|bH11EgJcaa	he likes you! if he didn't he wouldn't care who he sat next to in the movies. and the friend probably is in on it.|`|YzpfCloRaa	I think he likes you, but he just didn't want it too be a date yet. Probably didn't want to rush.|`|xSURVvqZaa	aah god, hes confusing me.<br>  Honestly i dont know.|`|eOStBjPtaa	he likes you.... period. next topic|`|quuLZ3Ojaa	OMG i feel the same way.

I guess you should flirt with him ALOT and hang with him when ever possible but dont be to romantic cause he might not like you and think you are opsessive over him!!! kk!! GOO' LUCK GURLIE!!!|`|7PqwM6QXaa	confusing lol.<br>  he was probably, idk, trying to be a gentleman by letting you go first<br>  but if he really liked you he would have chosen to sit next to you.<br>  hmm i really dk.<br>  sry.|`|14e9ef73980e3a2ab30467901f107e04aa	maybe he`s not into you like that or he wants 2 take things slow. it`s always best 2 be friends 4 a while b4 starting a serious or potentially serious relationship. he might just want 2 get 2 know you a little more b4 he makes his move.

AA10065812	???????<br>  Well, only 15% of non-custodial mothers are ordered to pay child support, but only 5% do.  That's 7 out of 1000.  <br>  <br>  The child support orders on women usually run less than the guidelines set out. It is not mandatory to follow the Child Support guideline amounts, though fathers are told that.<br>  <br>  Fathers pay their child support in 80% of the cases, according to Judge David Grey Ross, Commissioner of the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement.  But, 10% of custodial fathers still have to pay child support to the mother.<br>  <br>  Father don't go for custody to get out of paying child support, only mothers do that.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Plenty of women pay child support, this is not a new phenomenon. My sister in law pays out of her asss in child support AND alimony to her ex every month.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I agree with you. What's good for the man is just as good for the woman.

I knew a woman who went through a divorce and her husband took her three children from her. She did nothing to stop him and she is now paying child support. Some women don't care enough for their children but only care about the money that they are supposed to get for them. The child support money is supposed to be spent on the children but sometimes it is only spent on what the mothers want and need and the children go without.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Thats your personal choice here but many custodial parents whether women or men, need that supprt to raise the kids on. Everyone does have the option of refusing the custody of the kids in court so no one is actually forced to take them. The courts just figure that the non custodial prent must contribute somehow and they cam up with financial support; child support. Now what the custodial parent actually does with the money is a huge concern of support groups everywhere. There is only theory and no real long term proof of women only wanting the money which is why the courts try to watch these mothers but cant due to the enormous amount of moms receiving support|`|ghz5D5iLaa	If  you have the kids than she should pay support. It is not about being greedy but about taking care of the  kids. Not everyone that gets support abuses it and spends it foolishly.|`|2DahzSWvaa	The mother would have to pay child support if the father wants her to. I know a mother who lost custody of her child to the father. She pays child support to support her daughter.|`|TnIsuYqYaa	If the father has custody then the woman HAS to pay,and theres no worming your way out of it.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	women should and do pay child support.|`|lvelp0CGaa	I think your just another of the minority in today's society who get's ripped off by dead beat parent's .<br>  <br>  Your right , women bash men over not paying support and 78% are just out for the revenge ( money ) it's easier for women to submerge themselves in the fantasy that only men dont pay and believe women do pay , but dont catagorize us all , a lot do bash women vocally over their selfishness and stupidity to not pay , its just not voiced a lot here because the higher percentage of repliers in yahoo questions and answers are women.<br>  <br>  My 2nd ex husband had the same issue you have and he still does , his 1st ex-wife does not pay support for their son she owes him thousands and sadly the child support agency dont give a flyen rats cooters hole about it , BUT when the child switches back to the mother within 4 days he is attacked and the money is gone , he has it taken out through his work pay so he doesnt even see it , but when the boy returns to my ex it takes anything from 6 months to a year before he see's 1 red cent out of the cow .<br>  <br>  He doesnt pay me child support , we have a private agreement , I dont ask for it he's in enough debt ( he has 2 children prior to mine with 2 money hungry scab women ) but if I need anything which is very rare he ALWAYS comes to the party and helps out .<br>  <br>  Unfortunetly societies view of support where dads are concerned is not going to change , just be proud of the fact you are not a dead beat you are a 100% hands on single dad raising gorgeous kids be happy and proud of the input you have where your children are concerned , I was raised by a single father and preffered living with him then my own mother , if you have any daughters the relationship between you will be way stronger then the relationship with your boys when your girls are in their late 20's and early 30's thats something awesome to look forward to .<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your children for the future and keep vocalising your opinion to help soceities main stream to snap out of fantasy land living .|`|wseP86qSaa	Maybe greedy is the wrong word for most of the women you are referring to?

However, it appears as if you do not trust him as fully as you should  and also that you do not respect his privacy. My suggestions  to you are  as follows: 1) Start to respect his privacy , do not read his emails without his permission or go into his computer again without permission even if it is open on the table in front of you.This way you would not see things that will bother you or that you are not supposed to see.Plus what if he violated your own privacy by going into your diary, or reading your own emails, or listening to your calls, or going into your computer without your permission. How would that make you feel. 2) This Lisa seems to be the same girl from a month ago that you already know about. If you think they are still in contact  then ask him about it. 3) Be ready for his questions if you ask him especially if you feel  that he knows  that you read his emails.4) Find a way to improve the trust between the both of you. Start by talking about any issues or problems you guys have, learn to compromise,  build a better relationship, and try to trust your man. 5) Finally, if you have any issues from your own life or past that is affecting your relationship with this guy, then find a way to resolve it. Think deep and hard about the issues I have raised , see if they play a role in the bigger problem of mistrust between you and your guy, and deal with them. I wish you both all the best.|`|vJvwYDGTaa	Thats way to much of coicidence! I dont know your situation fully, but I do know that no girl deserves a guy whos gonna spend his time in a relationship, online flirting iwth some other woman. Obviously he did cheat on you, or why else would this woman randomly send a topless pick? Talk to him about it!|`|lK3TXGBOaa	i think he is but i guess talk to him...confront him and ask him about it... good luck <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can you please answer mine...<br>  <br>  go to my profile under my questions and its the first one that says  <br>  <br>  " HELP!! need advice......."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it<br>  <br>  thanx :)|`|c9f676588616bf588f7dfd5b30f60d96aa	If i went into my boyfriend's email and found a picture of a topless woman i would be concerned too, if u ask him he would know u snooped so just keep your eyes and ears open.|`|IcRhcar1aa	sorry, but it sounds like he is. get rid of him!|`|FgSTHArKaa	it looks suspicious<br>  honestly go talk to him abotu it<br>  or try mentioning about some dude that asked you to go to dinner with him<br>  make him jealous|`|91aDQQ66aa	I wouldn't be surprised if he was cheating on you, and if he's not he's planning to.|`|P5GhUEvoaa	The girl is a btch.UGH,,,,I hate btch..|`|mRe8IlDZaa	yes|`|T57y1bfPaa	If he stopped talking to her randomly, then he might not be cheating. She just seems like a really desperate person to send a photo of her topless. It may sound cheesy, but try just talking to him about it. Hopefully he'll be honest, but if he isn't, you'll probably be able to tell. You can tell if he's lying if he doesn't really look in your eyes, tries to make his answer really short then drops it, or doesn't seem comfortable and keeps fidgeting.|`|vU3IMRIIaa	Maybe when you called him out on it he really did stop talking to her, and she wanted to know why he hasn't responded in so long. I don't think you should read his email anymore, no disrespect, but if you read it and you think he is cheating then everything you read is going to make you feel even more insecure. Put your faith in him, and don't let that go until you know he is no longer worthy, if you keep thinking and accusing you will push him away.|`|DLQZ8Lreaa	i hate to say it, but it is most likely the same girl.... <br>  something along those lines happened to me, and my boyfriend told me that he would not cheat on me but he ended up doing it anyways. you should confront him about it directly, and if you notice him kind of making up things or acting suspicious then you can almost be sure that he did... im very sorry =/|`|0ixYCtKjaa	if you really think he is just tell him you need to <br>  talk, if he hasnt lied to you yet, and you havnt<br>  given him a reason to start then why worry? i <br>  would just talk to him.sometimes things arnt<br>  what they seem, but yet somethings are.just <br>  be carefull with what you say to.if your mad you <br>  dont want to say things you dont mean..i know<br>  i do.but goodluck(:|`|se3EnpZqaa	It definitely sounds like the same chick to me. but it doesn't sound like hes cheating on u, more like the lisa wants to see him again. I think you should talk to him. tell him that this lisa person sent a message while you were on his laptop.|`|znZxydq5aa	oh love im soooooooo sorry but i think ur bloody mate iss bloody cheeting on you actualy im quite sure.... so i think itz best to break it off or what ever you want to do becouse my ex-partner ali waz cheeting on me it was in that exact same way .......a chick w/ out a top in a msg. exept her name was brianna. :(|`|4fbfc0fe35c14ef5eb67005cbddb8675aa	he's done nothing wrong<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bigwilliestylerec..." rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/bigwilliestylerec...</a>|`|WWlUrwJxaa	He could easily be cheating on you,it could be worse later on in the relationship so my sdvice is to break it off with him.<br>  Beleive me its better now than later on.|`|cVQNNnQdaa	boys boys boys. this boyfirend of you sounds like hes cheating. how do you know hes not deleting his messages or talking on the phone with her. you never know, just keep ur eyes open youll know id he is soon|`|AA12057122	Dump that asshole, you can do better.  I know it hurts, though|`|qkUnVwR1aa	dont break up with him|`|FtD7KDfpaa	well maybe he's cheating on you or lisa likes him and she's trying to split you guys apart|`|6Mgi6Womaa	same chick<br>  <br>  looking for more action
t0rOQ5FWaa	In a time of crises like Obama has got us in to which is only going to get a lot lot worse she should get a job, before long it's going to take a barrel full of cash just to buy a loaf of bread|`|bV7yfxpKaa	Now wait a minute here.  I cook, clean, do laundry, bake all our desserts, iron, mend, hang laundry on the clothesline, and don't get weekends, holidays, sick days, or a paycheck.  But who says I don't work?  On what my husband makes as a state employee, trust me, he can't afford to pay me.  And even with 35 years with the state, all they have to do is eliminate his position and his job security is gone. And don't tell me about benefits, because those benefits don't pay the bills.  I have to do some fancy budgeting to make ends meet just like anyone else that stays home.  Would we change it?  No.  But if we suddenly needed me to, I'd be out there bagging groceries if I had to.  He needs to define a crappy job.  Not everyone has 6 figure jobs.  I wish they did though.|`|93r3nCM1aa	I agree with him to a degree....she should start to find a job. It could take him months to find a job. If both of them are actively job hunting though, there's a greater chance that one of them will be employed. Maybe she has skilled he doesn't have.<br>  <br>  But when she does find a job, if he chooses not to work, then he does need to pull his weight at home and do the cleaning and cooking.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with her choosing not to work, if that's what the couple agrees on and if that's what works. But when NEITHER of them are employed, or they're barely making bills I think it's a bit absurd for her to insist that she doesn't need a job, and put all the money-making pressure on him.<br>  <br>  He needs to pull his weight and help her around the house...but she needs to pull her weight too and help with the job hunt, maybe even getting a job herself if he can't find one.<br>  <br>  I'm in a similar situation. I work 2 jobs because my husband is leaving to go into the military in 6 months and no one wants to hire a dude who's just going to quit 6 months in the future.<br>  <br>  But even though I work really hard, he still does his part, and I get to come home to dinner (albeit not always the greatest meal, but even if he just microwaves me a burrito and accidently shrinks my pants when he does the wash it's better than having a lazy @ss.)|`|UJD2eYebaa	Not a bad thing if they both decided that from the beginning, but obviously it's not a decision set in stone & both have to be flexible in response to the unexpected (his layoff).  Wouldn't make sense for her to dig in her heels on this one & refuse to get a job where she could contribute more money.  I assume she likes to eat...|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Ok there are a few questions here. It is not wrong if the two agree and the man can manage the bills. On the other hand this man is having a hard time and has asked her for her to help out. She should get off the net and get a job. He is taking care of himself and she is NOT his wife, he may get tired of it and find interest in someone who is trying to do her best. Does not matter what type of job he has. The point is he has one and now days you got to take what you can get.|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	right now the economy sucks and so long as he has some kind of job.I don't work because we already have children on with special needs.I want to but my husband won't change his hours to make that possible for me and it is causing a lot of problems for us|`|AA11785285	They aren't ready for marriage, nor for kids.  They are two uneducated babies.  If he wants kids, he'll bail before the first one is 18 months old.<br>  <br>  Nope, she need to finish her education, and him too.  <br>  <br>  And they both need jobs, and they both need to pull their own weight. <br>  <br>  Frankly, he sounds like a jerk, and she an idiot.  They might just be perfect for each other... the sad thing is, they will indeed have a kid, and it will be the kid growing up with no dad...  And tha't a promise.<br>  <br>  Happens every time.<br>  <br>  30% of white kids now live with just mom, and 62% of black ones do.<br>  <br>  shocking isn't it???????????.. <br>  <br>  and all of them start out like these two.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It is not wrong if that is what they decide on however sometimes things change. Since he has lost his job she does need to pull her own weight and not let them both fall while she lets him worry about it. As for working a crappy job, if that is all he can get right now there is nothing wrong with it. A crappy job is better than no job. This man is trying and he needs help.|`|X5WvcErkaa	Yep.  No one should feel entitled to just stay at home--unless kids are involved already---and expect the significant other to pull all the load.  So, maybe he feels its his turn, hum?  If he can barely pull his own weight, then she definitely should pitch in and not expect a man to be her beast of burden.  She's being selfish and lazy.|`|cY4vg9VAaa	I'm in the same boat. I don't work because I'm a full time student. We are now in a financial bind because my husband got layed off. I wish that I had a job but with my crazy school schedule, it's hard to find someone to work with me. <br>  <br>  If she isn't work for the sake of not working then yes, she needs to stop being lazy and pull her weight.|`|K4MuUaqiaa	He lost his job so as part of a partnership, the female should get off her butt and help out. When he gets back on his feet, and gets a new job that can support the whole family, that is when you can go back to staying at home.<br>  <br>  Support your man through the bad times too.|`|NrEyfsDYaa	Not wrong from him to take a job to support himself. All work is good work when you are supporting the people you love in an honest way. <br>  You friend may want to consider getting a job as well.|`|uNtdaajuaa	absolutly NOT you no that womin NEED to work for self fillfillment. How wood you fill if your husbind said "IM NOT WORKING ANYMOORE"<br>  <br>  ??<br>  <br>  THINK ABOUT THAT ONE MISSY|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	she is not a bad person, I'm sure if things have been good and stable her husband would not have had a problem with it now.<br>  it is a financial crisis they are in now, so they need to work it out together, he needs to find a job to support the family as he has been the main income source from the beginning, and she needs to help out one way or another.<br>  <br>  an online job, or any kind of business idea that generates money can also be considered, it is not only traditional jobs that put food on the table "although it is of a much higher chance to ensure food is on the table.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	since you don't know anything about him it is not fair to judge them <br>  but I agree with they should not be in your house since they are not mutual friends of yours <br>  but my advise is to close your bedroom and if your have children lock their rooms after they have gone to bed<br>  people do strange thing after they get drank|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Just keep on complaining on yahoo answers till they are all gone so they can have fun in peace without the witch ruining everything.|`|wseP86qSaa	Do you guys have kids? If you do then I would be worried about having all these strangers in my house. But especially if you don't have kids, I personally would be annoyed too, but maybe your husband wants you to meet his friends. You might just end up having a good time, you never know! Probably for your sanity you should just keep an open mind and trust your husband for tonight. Seems that he also wants to show you off! ;)|`|bb2cafcc1198c3f1dea9c78f472dc7e9aa	Guys seem to go though fazes. Like they can only be handle being "tied down" for so long. All the "rules and loss of freedom" that comes with commitment. Then its like they need to rebel and do stupid stuff like this. try to hold out for a while and see if it just a faze unless it starts affecting your finances or something serious. Like he goes to the bar so much you don't have money for food etc.|`|ZKsSnT64aa	There are things that women do that we consider "stupid" and yet we are expected to be understanding about the fact that we are different in those areas.<br>  <br>  Do the same.<br>  <br>  Im sorry but in my marriage I wont be doing only the things that my wife "approves of"<br>  <br>  I dont think he should insist on you staying there but as far as bringing people over goes..... its his house too<br>  <br>  Does he tell you that you cannot bring your friends over??<br>  <br>  If he does then I can see your point there as well but you should not get mad at him for going out unless he gets mad at you for the same and if you choose not to go out,then thats on you
T0KHIFgaaa	Your friend obviously has problems, and if you were a true friend, you wouldn't bail on her because he has them. Just ignore her when she goes off like that. She probably doesn't realize what she's doing.|`|8Initt1aaa	If you truly care about them I would experiment in different ways to make them feel loved and comforted (maybe closeness doesn't work). Give them space or cheer them up randomly (buy flowers or do some nice suprising deed). Find your nitch. There is something out there that will cause a positive reaction and shift attitude about feelings and emotions to become more positive. Wow, that was deep.|`|8kfmqxXSaa	IF THEY'VE GONE THRO THAT THEY WILL BE SHAKEN<br>  <br>  just let them do it and then STAY THEIR FRIEND<br>  <br>  they probably don't have very many and it'd make em even more depressed if you stop being their friend.|`|RtxKqeMFaa	Whoa. take them to a psychologist/psychiatrist. Whoa. I feel sorry for the guy. Whoa
3wKGTZvAaa	Okay I added you. Let's see what you got!
IbWBAwVPaa	She sounds like an idiot and she'll just bring you drama and BS! It sounds like she is your EX friend for a reason. Take the time to think about the reasons you ditched her to begin with. From the way this sounds you were right to let her go! I say forget her, there are millions of COOL people in the world that you can be friends with. Why have this in your life? Especially when you made the decision to get rid of her once before! Why do this to yourself again?|`|4oEcsWeWaa	i think u should just be friends again but just like w/e friends <br>  make her tink that u care for her but really you dont care|`|DcqaZRoVaa	this had nothing to do with an ex <br>  <br>  but i'm still answering it! <br>  <br>  don't let her stupidness get to you. be like "whatever. cool. sure. fine." be mellow, and don't think about that. she just wants to fit in. let her tag along. <br>  <br>  makes her feel happy, and important.
2c2658034b575cfb6ed9a7a5f800a1acaa	You don't have to wear a sari to be respectful to go to a Hindu wedding.  Just look at Bend It Like Beckham (movie), all of the Indian women were wearing saris and the English girl just showed up in a nice outfit that any Western girl woul wear to a wedding.  I would just wear a nice dress, skirt, or pantsuit.  Be a little more conservative (like no spaghetti straps) since different cultures are a little more conservative and don't wear red or hot pink since I think that is the colour that the bride most often wears in Hindi weddings.|`|JlXujkBoaa	you can get sahris on ebay for cheap or ask your cousin who is getting married what you should do... his advice would be best since it is his wedding|`|yM6VOWzUaa	whoa.. whoes getting married the 13 yr old or the 16 yr old ??|`|fSR4bgHPaa	If it's a Hindu theme wedding then I'd get a sahri, maybe borrow one or something. If it's not the theme then just wear a nice dress.
dFHsAXDMaa	suggest she talk to her mother about getting counseling to work of her self esteem issues because no one should make you feel guilty for being all you can be...when they are being all they can be but are too busy whining about all they are not... it is not your job to be her constant ego booster...she needs counseling.|`|XqHPQIOtaa	Well first off tell her that you feel flattered, and the easiest way to handle this Even though you might feel a little bad is tell her its getting a little annoying and it is making u feel guilty.|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	Get her a boyfriend.|`|efTvaFFFaa	she sounds like she has low self esteem and is a little insecure. Try and laugh with her and set in a happier atmosphere (happiness and smiles are contagious!), or if you're really dedicated you could trip over (a SMALL trip, you dont want to break anything...) or do something like that in public and say something like 'oh i'm so clumsy!'. or think about what shes really good at and compliment her at it. Or a makeover if it's about her looks, but if you decide to do that, don't hurt her feelings when you offer because she could jump to conclusions and think 'oh so she thinks im ugly too...'<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|0e4wLPhgaa	IGNORE HER! just change the subject she likes it when you say " no im not" or "YOU are better than ME"... if she doesnt change the subject just tell her... " well YOU are better than me a this other thing"
IT306Kytaa	all three of you should get together and talk about it<br>  make sure there's no misunderstandings|`|mbYEP8GRaa	well i know the girl friend will still like you but she is still very upset over it and was crying at church b/c of it but she will just be sad and she will not be hanging out with you or claire or cassie and them at lunch for a while but will be somewhere else in the school. but im not really sure what he will think. but if u want to know both of them will never be friends....ever and she is going to try to avoid him and attempt to get out of gym on Monday so she does not have to she him and tell our homeroom teacher that she needs to go to the nurse or something so she does not even have to give him eye contact or she will cry and then people like Cassie will try to figure out whats wrong.|`|O8pJYz5Kaa	If your friends are not friends its ok! Just call them or meet them and say your sorry! And explain you care about both of them!|`|o6IiYw6baa	bring them together and then talk about it and then if u cant come to a resolution then just keep them apart|`|yM6VOWzUaa	i dont know<br>  maybe there is a secret behind all of this that you dont know about|`|sVdCGwIUaa	Oh shut up we all know u'd pick the guy friend inside but pick the girl fran outside! jk jk by the way and dont like kill me or id have to make my own q about that!|`|KtR0NstMaa	This is a tough situation.   Best thing for you is to stay out of it.  But will they still like you - probably.  Just let them know you are still you but plan on staying out of it.
N8S9hp8Naa	well since she hangs with your group of friends, let all your other friends know that you didn't do anyhing and you have no clue why she said such things.<br>  and while you're hanging with the group and she's there, just ignore her. dont fight back cause that will causee drama.<br>  just act like she isnt there. dont let ONE girl ruin your friendships with all the others.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!(:|`|37b2ywgaaa	I've bin in this situation many many times. She probably just started a roomer to get attention or something if she treats you like that treat her the same way she's treating you. Don't worry if there true friends they'll stick with you friends come and go but only true ones stay!!!I'm 15 and from my experience  the rumor chatting stated around grade 6 and it usually sticks through  grade 8 and stuff but after that it get's worse girls will be making even more ruder rumors about you!!!<br>  <br>  Good-Luck!!!!;)|`|58ScqWG3aa	Ok now personally those sound like fighting words to me,so I think you should go up to her and ask her does she have a problem with you(have sum girlfriends behind you for backup)and if she does then tell her that if she doesn't want to be friends with you then fine,she doesn't have to.Don't just continue to talk about her behind her back because then that would only deepen her hate and you don't want that.|`|EnEEMJmYaa	Hmm, well, maybe you should go up to that girl and maybe try to resolve things by asking why she hates you, why she keeps talking bad about you, or you could just straight out try telling her to stop. If you're afraid your friend will side with her then try asking them for advice before that happens.|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	Some people you just don't like no matter what they do or say. You just find them annoying. Maybe that's her issue. Or maybe you offended her in some way.|`|RtxKqeMFaa	Ha! Jealousy! Just give 'er a taste of her own medicine and settle yur scores:)|`|5PZnWcFBaa	that happed to me one time i made some new Friends but thats me|`|SGcf4HPIaa	It's sounds like the ever so common way of trying to fit in with other people and figuring if she acts a certain way then they will like her. So she is the one with the problem not you because she tinks she has do and say things to fit in. <br>  People like that are so unpredictable and ridiculous because all they do is change from one second to the next and they will stab you in the back to save themselves <br>  . Just try to ignore her and move on to better friends. <br>  She's a bad seed and it will spread throughtout her new group of frinds if you let her know it bothers you.<br>  Don't let her she that and continue not to say anything bad about her.<br>  She will be pissed because everything she tries doesn't work and will eventually give up.|`|LZco6K5jaa	first of all how old are you because this whole thing sounds very childish. But regardless girls will be girls and if you gave her no reason to hate you then most likely she is jealous of you and if your friends do stop being your friend just because this girl forces them to then they were never your friends at all and to be honest I wouldnt want friends that could be so easily manipulated.|`|GDiH3dUJaa	You should pull her aside and ask her why she's behaving like that. Most likely, she's just jealous of you and doesn't like you because she feels that you're better than her.|`|x3b3QguRaa	i would bet money that her hate to you only has to do with her personal issues<br>  haters only reflect how they feel about themselves|`|yZX1wpUJaa	well if she takes your friends on her side then I guess they wernt really friends to begin with. You wouldn't want those types of people in your life anyway (if that would happen)|`|dKxrbUQZaa	I've heard that high school friends don't last but college ones do, cause you're both more mature when you meet people in college.<br>  Don't work extra hard to make your friends like you, you shouldn't have to work for your friends to like you, the only approval you need is yours and God's. So if your friends decide to hate you too, then let them go off, and be happy your not friends with people that hate you, and instead just have fun with your life and meet new people. But for now I would just stay nice to her, and maybe ask her what you did that made her so mad|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Is she jealous of your other friends? Sometimes in wanting you to be their friend they can test your reaction by being hurtful. I suggest that you take her quietly to one side and ask her politley what is wrong with her by being like this.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? She sounds jealous to me. And if the other girls are your true friends, they won't take her side.|`|SHiESc4zaa	its a group of girls= bitchy it will be fine in a couple of days.|`|YWpmZ7Opaa	You sound like you are in the 6th or 7th grade, that happens to me all the time. Your "Friend" will get over it. Watch everything you say about her even if you are really mad!!! She could hold anything against you!!! Maybe she needs space, leave her alone and she will come crawling back to you! Don't let her get you angry or let her give you dirty looks. If she does then go up to her and nicely say, WITH ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS, "Please stop being rude to me and giving me mean looks, I don't appreciate it." And walk away. Bring one of your friends because she can mix up your words! She could of heard a rumor or something. Don't worry about anything as long as you didn't do anything to upset her. If you did then you need to apologize. It can be hard but its better than having her tell your mom, TRUST ME! <br>  <br>                                        Best of luck.

Just by reading that paragraph I can tell that if I ever met you I'd never be your friend and I'd probably spit in your face.<br>  You do sound kind of suck up to me and a little too smug. 'My boyfriend is [definitely] (spell it right) the hottest in the class' tells me you're shallow. As if it matters that boys like you and you have 'tons of [amazing friends]'.<br>  If you're really better than him, forget about having a comeback and walk away.|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	You could answer:<br>  <br>  -  Look who's talking  (always my favourite)<br>  <br>  -  Talk to my hand coz my ears ain't listening (need bit of an attitude for this one)<br>  <br>  -  Do you know spelling of family? and if spells it right, pick up another word from his answer that you could ask him for spelling.  (this will really wind him up)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

If he doesn't make the effort to rebuild the trust and love in your relationship then you do need to move on.|`|rQfzifT7aa	He most likely does want to reconcile, he has found out that the grass is not greener on the other side.<br>  <br>  If you don't like being cheated on then I suggest you not reconcile with him. After 3 times, you take him back and he knows that you will accept it. Your just being a doormat for him.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	No.  I wasn't born yesterday.  Once would be my limit.  If he screwed up again, he'd be gone.  I don't even know if I could handle it once to be honest.

( this is how I view most relationships).  In my opinion, if the guy/girl you're in a relationship with even cheats on you ONCE, then he/she will be forever known as a cheater. Even a sinner can be forgiven for their sins when they truly work on never committing the sin again, but in your cheating husband's case, he had sinned against you 3 times. He obviously need to get some professional help before he can truly be faithful but it might take years and a person only needs to see the other side of a person once to know if they're really loyal. Since he has yet to show you that he loves you enough to stop embarassing the relationship, then the answer is a definate NO. But don't worry, through prayer and faith, God will bring your true and loyal partner into your life soon so leave it up to Him to show you your destiny.|`|wseP86qSaa	Don't do it, you'll just end up going through even more heartbreak and end up having to leave him anyway in the long run. Why GIVE him YOUR time, YOUR life, years of your life. Take that time to heal and improve your standing in life, don't give that time to him to stomp all over you and break your heart again.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Well you have forgiven him all these other times.  What do you have to loose that you have not already lost.  You should let him know that if he does it again he will only see smoke.  You would be gone so fast he won't know what to do.  <br>  Keep your eyes wide open and also start planning your escape agenda and do it in grand style.  Make that bastard sorry that he did it the first time.|`|6BjZkRuYaa	Nope.  It would be the END the 1st time. We both know this of each other.... so, if one or the other decides to cheat - they are picking that person over our family.  There will be no 2nd chances. We both come from cheating parents and know we have NO ROOM FOR IT IN OUR LIVES.  3x??  Your crazy.|`|jpimg8doaa	You already know what people will say but you want someone to say give the jerk another chance so you don't feel guilty when you tell him to leave.  He shouldn't even ask for another reconciliation.  He doesn't deserve one.  I wouldn't allow my heart to make the decision.  let your brain decide for you.  Help him pack and remain friends.|`|QVj2JwWKaa	NO FREAKING WAY!!!!!!|`|DLQZ8Lreaa	no one deserves to get cheated on, you shouldn't take that because it causes more troubles along the way with trust issues and other such things.<br>  dont believe anything he says at the moment.|`|vHjYw1txaa	No, he didn't the last 3 times why will he stop now?  You deserve someone better.  You made it ok by taking him back the other times.

4UV5423Qaa	well, we have a similar background.i can tell you it doesnt last forever. what you can do until youre 18 is to be uncompromisingly good to her. prove to yourself that you are and were a good son. ignore anything negative she has to say if there is no truth to it. why? when you turn 18, you will be guilt free and your conscience will be clear when you leave. what you can do for the time being is to prepare an exit strategy. youll be leaving in 4 years tops. it sounds like a long time but it isnt. trust me. you havent lived that long. focus on your schooling too. it should be a top priority. education will bring you places far away, wonderful places where you will be free and your own man. do yourself a favor and learn to keep your emotions in check NOW. you are growing up, which means your limbic system, an area in your brain that deals specifically with emotions, is fully developed or close to it and running amok.add that to the hormones surging in you, and your underdeveloped frontal cortex, the area responsible for reason, and youre a walking basketcase(no offense, all teenagers are).keep your emotions in check. this doesnt give you the excuse to lash out. it will be wholly advantageous to you to be in total control of yourself and surroundings. dont be an effing idiot and a rebel. visualize it, man, in four short years, youll be in some other city, going to school, having your own place, an adult. until then do everything in your power to know what it is you want, "know thyself", find a way to make it happen, and do it. just keep in mind that nobody's perfect and there will be setbacks and failures and missed opportunities. that's all right. thats a part of life. always learn from your mistakes. when you leave home, please keep in touch with your mom, for her sake and yours.<br>  best of luck.just click on my icon to contact me. i'm a college student, so im busy, but ill try to help you out. peace.|`|0rjKnY7Eaa	I am only hearing one side of the story but it sounds to me like your doing your best! Keep in mind that your mother is probably under alot of stress herself and may be finding it hard to communicate with you. Sometimes when you have alot on your mind you say and do things you dont mean. As your mother im sure she is proud of you, and if anything all you can do is try to have a one on one conversation with her, without ANY yelling or pointing fingers and explain to her that you are trying to help yourself and please her and you too need some time to yourself. never forget she is your mother and you should have the upmost respect for her, but that doesnt mean you cant voice your opinion,, hopefull you will both come to an understanding! goodluck

c07v7O80aa	Don't go by the age other people report being married. Go by when you are fully able to be just fine on your own, which is when you can consider marriage without it being partly because of bad motives.|`|93r3nCM1aa	When a person chooses to get married depends entirely on their maturity level and if they think they're ready to get married. I don't think there's an age where someone "should" get married at vs. an age where they "shouldn't" get married. <br>  <br>  I got married when I was 19, and I'm still married.<br>  <br>  We've been married 2 years, and have been together for a total of 4 years (and no...we don't have any kids yet, because we aren't in the financial position to do so). <br>  <br>  I know a lot of people say "people who get married younger than blah blah blah age never make it" but honestly...why does that matter?<br>  <br>  Divorce exists for a reason. And even though people who get married young have a higher rate of divorce, why should that be the deciding factor in when you get married? <br>  <br>  Get married because you love the person...and if it doesn't work out 5 years down the road, then it doesn't work out. There is absolutely no way to know if a marriage is going to work forever...I've known people who were married for 30 years and then got divorced.<br>  <br>  Sure, I sometimes thought to myself "what if we get divorced later because we got married too young?" But then I realized that why should that even matter? I love my husband very much, and  I'm really really really happy. If I hadn't married him simply because I thought we were "too young," I would be a lot less happy right now.|`|AA11785285	All these people who marry and have kids before 20, are never together 5 years later.  They make up the 30% of white moms raising kids alone, and 62% of black ones who are.<br>  <br>  Shocking isn't it?<br>  <br>  Marry any time you want... really not an issue.  But don't have children until you know each other well, have a great job and a great education.  <br>  <br>  Here are the rules my mama nailed to the inside of my bedroom door when I was 11.<br>  <br>  <br>  1.  The most important decision you will ever make is who you marry.  Choose with your head as well as your heart.<br>  2.  Have no children until your bond is strong, and have no more than you yourself can support.  You may just have to<br>  3.  At any and all costs finish your education to qualify for those high paying jobs.  It is likely that you will work sometime during your marriage, probably for decades…. Get paid for it. And remember, your kids and your education are forever…. Husbands, lovers and promises are not!!<br>  4.  Have a stash of cash no one knows about even if you are sure you will never need it.  You absolutely will, and the more the better.<br>  <br>  Keep them for yourself.  <br>  <br>  Hon I have always had a beautiful life... and it was because of these rules.  Never married a jerk, never got pregnant out of a marriage, and didn't have kids I never planned for, and got that great education... and I got to retire at 48, and travel the world.  Read my Avatar.  Ya can't do that on a hs drop out's salary.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	Being that marriage is such a serious thing I think that the more mature you are the better equipped you will be in handling very emotional situations. For men some where about 25-30 years of age. That depends on the person. If you think your mature enough than possibly 22-23.|`|qmsgEJIwaa	I'm female. oh god I can't remember how old I was. 32? I know that women always remember things like this down to the last second but I don't. I'm just one of those females that doesn't really think these things are important. Although I am married and I think I'm happy. lol|`|NrEyfsDYaa	38|`|0e5aeac0b9db1edd4e79c50eed3109f2aa	I got married when I was 40 after being with my husband for 7 years. I used to believe it would have been better to do it in my twenties or early thirties, but when I look back on that era of my life, I am glad I didnt because I had alot of fun. LOL. The only regret I have about getting married at such a late age is feeling as if the huge wedding would be senseless because I wasnt the young blushing bride, but that also came with the fact at my age, I see more value in my money. The right age depends on the person and their life experience. If you feel that you have done everything you wanted to do as a single person by the time you are 25, then marry at 25. It all really depends on the person.|`|3C99PBtvaa	I got married at 17. I had a son about a year into it. We were too young, people tried to tell us when we got married but of course we didnt listen... We fought all the time, he was WAY less mature then me which was a huge problem and we split up after trying to make it work time and time again for almost 2 years. We were together 3 total with dating and marriage. You do what you want, there is no age where its "right or wrong" but you have to do what you feel is right.|`|qDGOi5Xqaa	I was 28 and I consider this to be a good time - I'd had several long time relationships at this point and learned a lot about myself and what I wanted in a man.  I was also mature enough and ready at this age and had a fun "single" time in my earlier 20s so that was out of my system.|`|FG9hjIIjaa	no younger than 29 or 30. A lot of research says that the younger you get married the more likely you are to divorce. I got married at 25...bad idea. You have to experience life before you get married. <br>  of course, everything is very individual too. Everyone is different. But I think 30 is a good rule of thumb in general.|`|iO4YHFavaa	Whenever you are ready to get married. If you are mentally matured then go for it. I am 19 and got married when i was 18.. that was couple of months ago. :) i love sharing every bit of my life n moment with my husband. Thanks God i didnt have to marry when i get very old.

SGcf4HPIaa	It is definaetly not you. I am sorry you are in this position. <br>  She is definately abusing her job role and trying to divide everyone without seeming like the bad guy through doing things, buying things and trying to befriend people. It is good that you see what she is and deny gifts. She is not doing this out of the goodness of her heart, but feels that in the long run she can use this as leverage whether she realizes it or not. Don't even give in to her little spills. She is nothing more then a trickster and back stabber. Sounds like she can't be trusted, so don't trust her. Try to have little to do with her without outcasting yourself. It may be hard but I think you know what limits are with her. Use your just and you'll be fine|`|SsfnitjXaa	It is a well known fact that women make the worse bosses.|`|BAlntsndaa	YIKES! Your boss is a lonely controlling freak, but that does not help you in the workplace. I had the same problem. My boss made it all personal and if you were on her hit list, she made life miserable until that employee quit or she found grounds to fire them. She even fired a girl for applying to a different department. It's a dangerous situation because this sort will lie right to you and polarize co-workers into fearing for their own jobs so they will not be there to defend you. My position ended with me quitting, but I had another job lined up. I still  regret leaving a job that I really liked- other than the boss lady. The whole place knew how she was too but was 2 years away from retirement so no one really did much about it. <br>  <br>  I would suggest starting a personal calendar to make daily notes on any unfair treatment and any practices that violate company policy. Then find a way to talk to her boss (without her knowing) and express your concerns as well as ask them how they feel you should handle it. Do your best to keep that conversation professional and detailed to specific incidents/actions without getting personal. It will lay groundwork and documentation should any serious incidents arise. Stress how much you enjoy your job and coworkers, but that the boss-lady sometimes makes things a bit too personal and you want to know how the job suggests you handle it. Her giving gifts is bribery.<br>  <br>  It's really the boss-lady being insecure that makes her behave this way and deep down she knows it so she behaves worse. It may honestly come down to you pretending to not let it bother you and learn to let it go as much as humanly possible. Next time she offers something - smile and say 'thanks boss, but I only accept gifts on my birthday or holiday and really appreciate you thinking of me.' It won't solve the problem, but will set a tone for you and co-workers. And keep smiling. Kill her with kindness. The meaner she gets, offer to do something for her or take on extra work. She will back off but return for another jab so smile bigger! Keep to job and most of all, stay kind and friendly to anyone else - DO NOT give her any ammo! STAY OUT OF THE GOSSIP. It won't show for awhile, but in time your professionalism, kindness and neutrality will gain you support and sanity. And some days, just find a hiding spot and vent for a minute while you count to 10 and go back out with a smiley face pasted on. Then trust in time and opportunity to take care of this.

3b73cc5bf948386f5b508e34a099b497aa	As much as your friends are trying to help you, it can come off as pity and that can get pretty annoying as im sure youve realized. The best advice I can give you is<br>  <br>  Start a Journal/diary: It will help you organize your thoughts so you can see on PAPER how your feeling and as weird as that sounds, SEEING it helps. When you write try to avoid "diagnosing" yourself. Dont say "maybe its because..." or "I think that I feel this way because..." just say I feel ___ because ____, analyze it later when its out of your head. Write about whatever you think of, and dont try to write a certain amount or even everyday, just know its there when you need to reflect. Thats the best way to take advantage of journaling|`|809f02e44041ffc6ba4b12719d107dcaaa	I was feeling the same way last year.

Pick up running as a hobby and I promise it will go away....|`|wRuWQA8Yaa	Its not abnormal for people to feel very down, and when you're down, you're most likely going to bring out the worst in ALL situations. I had this exact same depression like problem last year and I got the same responses from people. What i did and this may not work for you it i turned to meditation and zen philosophies. I met a girl Rachel who is now my best friend, and she really helped me to over come my problems. There's got to be something down deep that's bugging you, even if you can't remember it right away. once you find out what that problem is, get it out of your system and move on with your life. "For every moment you waste, there's another right behind it to take it's place." Life will go on, and you should make the most out of it. :) i hope i made a little sense. sorry if i didn't. Good luck!|`|WnOgbOmiaa	start reading books. It'll help you

I'm young, I'm handsome and today I will say hello to 10 new people (girls) When you get a date don't talk about this other girl. <br>  Seriously, anyone who uses the word googolplex has something great to offer this world. <br>  You are obviously intelligient and funny. God is the lifter of your head, a friend that sticks closer than a brother, a friend who will never leave you or forsake you. <br>  <br>  You are one in a googolplex!!! Don't ever forget that.

Nice personality, pretty eyes, lush hair...? <br>  <br>  Now think about this:<br>  <br>  Google informs me that the world population is 6,706,993,152 . <br>  That means that there are around 3,291,805,000 girls in the world. <br>  Thats 3,291,805,000 personalities, 3,291,805,000  sets of eyes and 3,291,805,000  lengths of hair. <br>  <br>  Im not undermining the fact that this one youve got your heart set on isnt amazing- Im sure shes a sweetheart.<br>  My point, however, is to consider how many people there are int he world versus how many you know. <br>  Statistically speaking, there must be millions of stunning, gorgeous, fun-loving lasses out there who you could fall for. <br>  <br>  However fabulous this girl may be, ultimatly if shes not going to feel for you what you do for her, shes not the one. <br>  <br>  The phrase 'There are plenty more fish in the sea' may arguably be the most insensitive in the history of the world. However, whether we like it or not, it would appear that this may just be the case. <br>  <br>  I wish you tonnes of luck. Chin up, and dont write yourself off just yet ;] xXx|`|HJI8778baa	Believe me, the saying there's plenty more fish in the sea really does ring truth. It may seem like now you had found the perfect girl, but that's subtended by deep psychological development attachment driven by hormones. <br>  <br>  You'll find someone else, perhaps someone better.

lwFo3IWtaa	This is really sad, it seems like your mother has a problem, she decided to hate you and be a ***** to you for no reason. As hard and heart breaking as it might be the only thing you can really do is move out as soon as you are old enough and like you said, never have anything to do with her again. I say this becasue from what you described she sounds like she will never be reasoned with or reasonable to you.|`|5nseONR7aa	I would advise staying away from her. Try a DNA test to make sure she really is your mom and maybe try to go to a psyciatrist with and figure out why she has always hated you so much.|`|ThvZUhKQaa	i would talk to your guidance councler about it she may be able to get her and you to a psychatrist and if i were you i would not of defended myself when she attacked you that way YOU could of called the cops and had her arrested ino it sounds bad but thats what i would do and i dont understand how you got removed i think it should have been her, my mom isnt as bad she does like me but she treats me as if i am incapable of any work and alys complains that i am lazy, i half know what you are going through-dmarkwell83@gmail.com email me if you wanna talk

AA10065812	???????<br>  Well, a newly created Profile to complain about a supposedly bad husband.  I wonder who you were before, or still are?<br>  <br>  So, he's stationed in Yuma.  That would make him a Marine, which means all you have to do is call the JAG office to get the family benefits transferred to you, not including filing for child support, so why are you living off your parents?<br>  <br>  Also, AS YOU ALREADY KNOW, they would be very interested that he's committing adultery, if he really is, since you haven't called them yet.  <br>  <br>  As for moving away, if you were actually served or informed of the filing, you would also been inform by both voice and writing that you are now under a PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION THAT THE CHILDREN MAY NOT BE MOVED FROM THE STATE, so this question is redundant, as you already know this.  I just got off the phone with one of our paralegals, whose based in Phoenix.  She gave me the rundown.<br>  <br>  So, get your story straight the nest time.<br>  <br>  If you want to know who she is, check when Patricia Ireland, former President of N.O.W., embarrassed the organization when she couldn't defend the stand that children don't need fathers, in a televised debate in the 90s.  C. made mince meat out of her.|`|AA10248966	yOU MIGHT HAVE TO PUT SOME SPORT OF ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPERS TO DIVEST YOURSELF AND THE CHILD FROM HIM. sPEAK TO A DIVORCE ATTORNEY WHO IS GOOD.|`|AA11785285	It would cost him money and time to chase you down.

That being said, there are legal implications when you have a child, so I think you should a. ask Ruth (what would we do without Ruth's guidance on here?!?! :) ), and b. find an attorney who can help you handle these issues.|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	Be careful and ask an attorney I am sure but If you move out of state and don't tell him he may have grounds for parental kidnapping.I Know that sucks but I don't want to see you get in trouble.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	For legal reasons, protect yourself from him..consult with a lawyer|`|ej8iwJzqaa	yes... go...leave him..for your child's sake- get out of there and start new while you still have someone to hang on to (your baby)..otherwise what will you have?? you could lose the baby either way though.. you could have stress of moving, and you could have a bast*** of an ex husband.. you choose.. either way, best of luck|`|UGOse5Dvaa	This guy dumps his pregnant wife and young son, and you want to know if it is OK to move on with your life?<br>  <br>  Yes.

AQdOcaxHaa	Well, first of all let me say that your really lucky (if you like the guy). Second, Im going to say a really cliche line: Just be yourself. To define that line, it means that you cant really try to be someone else, becasue all you'll ever really be is yourself looking strange. So when he says something, say something back. Dont leave any quiet spaces in between your conversation. If he tells you about something that happened, dont not say something. Reply with a "cool!" or a simple "thats great" or "oh my gosh" if its appropriate. And if you have a story or something related to that subject tell him about it to let him know that your really listening and that you really care about what he's saying. And thank him for any compliments or just for the fact that he asked you to hang out.Good luck!!|`|kQgSi1MEaa	Be yourself.  Calm down, be comfortable. Let things flow out.

Just be natural and if you can't think of anything just start off with, 'what'd u do today?' or something, it sounds lame but it gets the ball rolling. Just think about him being a friend, don't be intimidated, after all, he's a guy. He's a human being that has a heart, a stomach, muscles and everything you have! (well except a couple of things lol) just think of it as no big deal!|`|Xar4Y5rFaa	Just pretend the guy is a friend that you are very casual with, and things should go fine.|`|7PqwM6QXaa	wow, thats kinda akward lol. a one-on-one time thing witha guy you just met can kinda be weird. Its like how they say in the movies ''just talk about sports, pets, etc.''|`|1Lo34oEDaa	ok everythings alright! just sit there on the grass or something next to him look at him look away and play like a peek a boo thing ya i know gay right but hey it works. he will smile youll smile then mmmm taste the rainbow!
B359bLqsaa	what you  have to do is forgive them and move on.  forgiveness is supposed to be a gift for you to give yourself, its not for them.  tell yourself that they are not worth all the emotional attention you are giving them, tell yourself they are immature for trying to hurt you the way they did, forgive them, and move on.  its the only way i can think of.
LI6oSTqiaa	Confront her; say diss;<br>  yoo its not my fault he likes me. I dont like himm. I dont want him. now if u want to figt over dat dumbb reason, am for it.<br>  <br>  because if u show her ur scared she will take advantage, but show her ur not a punk,.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Just ignore her. She's an attention-seeker. If you pay her any mind, you'll just feed the fire.<br>  <br>  Be the bigger and better woman and don't even think about her. She does not exist.<br>  <br>  If she tries to pick a fight, just laugh at her and tell her you have more important things to do with your life and walk away. Not fighting doesn't mean that your scared. YOU pick your battles. Fighting over some dude would just make you look like some dumb girl. <br>  <br>  If she touches you, you lay her out. Other than that, just move on with your life. You have better things to do.|`|4T9fZzITaa	tell her off<br>  say wtf is your problem..<br>  tell her you dont like the guy<br>  its not your fault he does<br>  and you dont want to be with that guy<br>  your not even interested|`|kqaZWgj2aa	suck that guy off.

0klCX1Ogaa	Don't worry about what you're going to do when she's gone, worry about now. She's still around so pay attention to that.

Do something that you normally wouldn't, just have fun with her.|`|RoBBArMeaa	i'm sorry ! i've never gone through that before . . and i kno it's pointless to reply with no advice, but i feel bad for you & wish you the best:) ps - if anything spend a lot of time with her and bring a positive vibe around her, always.|`|8ee4GOb9aa	Still be sad that it happened,but go towards new people,or people in the same situation<br>  <br>  <br>  but dont worry nothing has happened,you never know she may get better|`|XGYjygdraa	awww poor thing poor both of you I  am so sorry just tell her how much you love her and pray for her I will pray for you and her and her family.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	For now, be there with her every minute until her time.  I am really sorry of the life that you are going through.
RDgyb7W8aa	Wait a week, you have been trough a trying experience. Then invite her over for dinner.  You don't have to act like nothing happened but tell you think the world of herr but what she said hurt.  Tell you hope she never gets in same situation.  Then start smiling at her and forget what she said.|`|Ni3hjtlsaa	Wow. I would have slapped her. How dare she say those things to you. It's painful to lose a baby and if she's never gone though that she has no right to tell you to "get over it." It's not like you asked for her opinion. She's the one that needs to apologize to you.|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	Ask her to forgive you, and ask Jesus to forgive you.|`|JUYjyP0xaa	talk to her and ask her whats going on and she is probably acting this way cause she is stress about somthing. talk|`|PFjIVvMmaa	I don't think she should have attacked you like that, but I think that all she was doing was caring about you. She wants you to finish your college and get a good job and everything. You need to meet up with her (if that is not possible, call her) and explain to her what you just explained in that paragraph. You need to tell her that what she said hurt you and that you feel you are mature enough to be a parent.|`|bd12e48132951f215b7fe910f10580d4aa	Wow, she sounds like my twin sister!  She was probably just trying to help you in her own so-called way, but should have talked to you in private.  Whenever I said anything to my mom about my sister doing things like this, the only response I got was well she's a fixer and she's just trying to fix what's wrong.   I would write her an email telling her how this hurt you.  I'm sorry for your loss.  Whether it was a good time or not for you to have a baby, that's between you and your husband and is no one else's business.|`|95313b2b1097ef8ff2783ec90aa114f8aa	you have to remember that people see things differently especially when it comes to serious matters, i went through somehting similar with my sis and i was the "bad sister" here, so in her defence i can understand her statement, i wanted my sister to get over it not in a bad way but so she wouldnt be depressed.  i told her she had one time to talk to me about it and i didnt want to hear it anymore which is simialr to saying woe is me...get over it.  when people arent emotional and havent experienced it for themselves its hard to relate and not just that but when its so serious it can easily turn into a sob fest which i didnt want and didnt want her to go through because she had already been through enough.  although harsh im not saying to forgive her immediatly but its your sis so eventually you will have too.  take your time to mourn and no that she is mournign with you only in her own way. when the time is right and your ok just call her up and talk about something mundane, she will be happy to hear you've moved on trust me no one wants there sis to hurt because we hurt too, when you can talk to her about anything like nothing ever happend trust me it will be a weight off of her shoulder as well, she is going through it with you, but doesnt want to add to it or make it ok for you to be sad its selfish but in a good way if that makes ANY sence at all

Err, ask him. Text him it if it makes it easier, or person is fine too. But if he does ask you out, tell him you would appreciate him not flirting with other girls.<br>  <br>  But my vote is yes, unless he's with his guy friends all the time and everybody laughs at him when you walk by. That may mean he doesn't. Hope for the best :)|`|98YJhZ2qaa	PLAYER ALERT STAY AWAY FROM HIM!!! just stay friends trust me i know.

Your mother could end up in alot of trouble! and Yes all of you can get in trouble for hitting each other only if someone charges the other! and DON'T go and try Charging anyone cause it will **** your family up and you will go to a foster home!|`|rqeEhVvXaa	Yes you can get into big trouble.  Hitting people only proves who is the stronger, you all ready know that. But have you thought of if they laid a complaint against you with the cops, Your gone big time|`|RvddYKqjaa	Your family is already is trouble. Why not get some help before you kill each other?|`|6CjDTJskaa	Yes if your mother called the police and you hurt one of them badly or even enough to make your mother scared enough you could get assault and battery (depending what you do to them i suppose) you'd get taken into custody by a police officer and most likely booked into a detention facility and your record would go down the drain, most likely you needed probation and maybe even a therapist or counselor or someone to talk to|`|04Te5gzzaa	Yes, you can be taken away to a foster family because you are physically threatening & abusing your siblings and your mother.  Where is your dad in all this?  He should beat you silly so you will know how it feels to be bullied.|`|AmpW5HuAaa	Even if you wouldn't get in trouble, why would you want to hit your family? :(<br>  You sound like a very angry and troubled person<br>  I suggest you get help<br>  And yes, you can get in trouble with the law.|`|JqVU84yLaa	JERRY! JERRY! JERRY!|`|Tv8cuXmtaa	yea<br>  Unnecessary violence is bullshit man<br>  and if your a dude you shouldn't be beating women<br>  and it doesn't matter what sex you are don't hit your ma seriously what kinda ****** up asshole hits his/her mother.|`|IGXE3aDraa	yeah you can. you need help, or your a T-R-O-L-L|`|BuP1JlIxaa	u shouldn't be hitting anybody no matter what age,|`|ej8iwJzqaa	YES...abuse is abuse !!!!! if you're afraid that you're going to continue to get hit or what have you, have you ever thought of BEHAVING !!!!!!!!!!!! your mom is an awful mother, and your sister sux equally as bad !! why dont you do this instead of 'hitting" them.. why dont you get help from an outsider, have them take you to a cop station, have a PROTECTIVE ORDER"filed against them.. you're a minor, and you have the riht to be protected like anyone else.. after you have this p.o taken out against them ,call the cops anytime they it or bad mouth you, and they, not you, will get into serious deep sh** !!! they can even face criminal charges..<br>  <br>  i advise you to do something NOW,before you wait any longer... think in 4 years you will be an adult, and if you still wanna fight back, you could get in trouble.. leave them alone, and let the real "helping" law ppl help you.. take out a protective order against not only your mother, but also your sister, or anyone else in your family that hurt you.. hurt can be in 2 forms.. physical and emothioal.. both are extremely painful and they can have a lasting effect on you..<br>  <br>  want me to call the cops for you???|`|GhqIkglKaa	well it depends where u live. here in Canada where i live you are responsible for your own actions when you are 12. so if you beat up your family members and they call the police you can be charged for assault.the outcome could be from community service to boot camp to 8 years in jail, depends how bad it is. well that's in canada, i don't know about other countries but im pretty sure its almost the same in the U.S. if the police is not contacted i guess the punishment is up to your parents.|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	dont hit your siblings. my mum used to hit me tons, when i'd done nothing wrong so i started hitting back which made her worse but then eshe stopped after realising i was stonger. so maybe give her a slap or something but dont go crazy cos you can get into trouble with the police if your mum decided to report it .. although if she did that you could do the same to her|`|pH0Imp3Jaa	You have a lot of growing up to do i think you should show your family some respect how would you feel if they died tomorrow and you would never see them again and as for the law you can be put into child care until your 18 and it is not very nice, Good luck|`|y6TbtvPoaa	Yes you can get in trouble if they call the cops. when this happens just try to go to your room and cool off or something. you don't want to go to jail because of a family fight|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	Yes, you can. But there is a difference between rough housing and abusive behavior. Its best not to walk that thin edge between them though.|`|XigYZ6Rhaa	not in law..u wont get in that bad of trouble ...but dont hit ur parents ad siblings they raised u and love u and i dont think they want a son hitting them..be nice 2 them....cuz when they die u will regret it...dont swear either it has no point|`|37b2ywgaaa	Umm yah...Just because your big doenst meen anything you cen get into alot of trouble with the law.!!!If you dont stop say hello to juvi!!!|`|xlSlfApBaa	yes, most definatly.<br>  Though the question should be asked, why hit your family members, granted you may get slapped by your mother, but it seems to be for disciplinary purposes (i.e. because you swear at her.)<br>  Granted she swears to, but most parents who swear attheir children do so out of anger, and dont want their  children to swear because they dont want the child to pick up their manerisms.<br>  It may also be a respect thing, i.e. she gave birth to you, fed and clothed you and deserves your respect. However when you swear at her that respect is stripped and she may hit you as she thinks it may force you to show respect (in most animals as well as humans, people show physical strength as a way of showing dominance)<br>  As for the sister thing, it is never good to hit younger siblings as they are very impressionable and will grow up to spurn your very existance in their household. Beating on the older sister takes away what respect she deserves too, <br>  Think of it as a natural pecking order, i.e. more respect with age. If your younger sister is the youngest then she will be favouritised as the mother may feel sad that she is the last child she will raise (an emotional ordeal for any woman.)<br>  Consider this, you live with a roof over your head, food is provided which you may not like but which contains essential nourishment, clothes are provided to hide you from shame in public and physical protection, if you decided to keep on beating your family members then you would most probably be kicked out of the house, police may be called, it goes on your record that you are abusive, future employers frown upon this as they believe you may bully other workers, you may get into college, try and live away from home in a dorm, but are not accepted in a dorm due to a violent history.<br>  Honestly man, it could potentially screw up your life, not to mention its morally screwed up.<br>  And believe me, a slap or something is not so bad, shes not burning cigarettes in your arm or breaking your fingers by slamming poys down on your hand while holding it on the counter, starving you for days at a time by padlocking the fridge and cupboards, nor are you having your head slammed into jiprock walls. Believe me it could be much worse!
cQ9T3YNmaa	honestly, its easier than you think.<br>  heres how i acheived this populartywhatever. it just sort of "happened" i guess.<br>  I joined every sport and club so of course i met lots of people.<br>  im outgoing and talkative....<br>  i make other people laugh easily o.o<br>  but honestly, you just have to be yourself.<br>  if you "try" to be popular it wont happen.<br>  oh and the biggest thing is to be NICE no matter what.<br>  people hate biitchez.<br>  im sry to say that we live in a messed up world like this but "appearance" and looks really do have an affect on people.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	that's a lame a** reason for wanting to be popular. how about you learn to love yourself so you don't care about what others think of you. if this is the way younger kids are acting nowadays then i'm not very hopeful for future generations.|`|BBtw9cmXaa	Popularity shouldn't matter.<br>  You are wasting your time.|`|532aaaac657962832353a7ad0df7fa59aa	Don't worry about it.  Life's too short to worry about being prim and proper.  Not like it really makes a difference.  (PS: I've notices that the "popular" kids at my school aren't rich.  They're just stuck up @$$es that do everything that's "cool")|`|0klCX1Ogaa	Popularity is a curse. You have to try and please everyone all of the time and I find it tedious. Stick with what you have, you're better off.|`|QSQ2AsBdaa	Be yourself.<br>  Would you rather be loved for someone you're not, or hated for someone you are.|`|WuTGzNVkaa	who gives a fart|`|37WQ3LKFaa	Get involved at your school. Leadership, ASB, help with school dances things like that. Get involved in clubs. They are not lame. The more people who know you the more popular you become. I am in like all of the clubs... asb, cheerleading, dance, and french club, interact club etc. Just be yourself and be outgoing! always love yourself!|`|8kfmqxXSaa	Idk I'm not popular I'm really sorry bout ur loss and just go up to them and talk to them|`|QLjjfwRfaa	ew get over your self. me and my friends are popular are like ******* fabulous and obvious your like not and its just like natural. so stop trying to hard to be something your not because your obviously not good enough beeeottccch.|`|13x9Tnpxaa	OK I don't come from your place. If you want to be famous in my high school you have to do extremely well in every subject or be a bad bully.<br>  Other ways to get your popularity:<br>  -Do/have something unusual: Like a singing talent or simply going around school yard on your hands with one shoe and orange pants.<br>  -Be the worst at everything you do. Lose everything you take part in. <br>  -Buy your way to fame: Offer a pay for everything everyone want to buy or purchase.<br>  -Discover deepest secret of a teacher and tell them to everyone.<br>  -Appear on reality TV<br>  -have a killer look or a president father.<br>  -Wear the most outrageous clothes you can find<br>  If you can't do any of these you can keep staying in the dark.<br>  OK I just want to have some fun. I'd feel really bad if I lost the president chair for someone just because he has more crowded attention.
0Yqjaj15aa	yes he does like you.=) if he looked flustered and embarassed he he does, his friend porbably wants you to know and wants you guys together.=)<br>  good luck!|`|udQvs0kZaa	You should ask him yourself and judge by his reaction what he thinks.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  And I just wanted to throw it out there that there is no way it is love yet.

I think he probably likes you but you can never be to sure. If he blushed and ran off then he definitely likes you if he just rolled his eyes and walked away then he probably doesn't. But if you want to be sure then you should try talking to his friend or even him you may feel stupid asking or you might be embarrassed but it will all work out in the end. I mean whats life with out a little risk.|`|6sjH8fMcaa	you really did not give enough information to tell. he could like you or he could be pissed off at his friend for screaming something that is not true. i know i would be mad if my friend screamed "she loves you" to a guy i am disgusted by. <br>  <br>  depends. <br>  <br>  did he ask for your number? thats important, because if the guy does not have a way to see you every day , then its important to them that they find a way to contact you. <br>  but all the same, he could just be shy|`|KetqNwtraa	look at the signs, he was embrassed enough that he would cover his friends mouth thats pretty dirty. you should go talk to him more to show signs that you are in to him.|`|b5fe796d075c46fe59eaafb9827bf167aa	If he likes you, he will let you know.  He will call you or find a way to talk to you.

You will almost to have to cry through your letter.  Good Luck|`|6ee3feb6285fbcb7ae64e5552099eccaaa	i certainly can feel your pain and wish i had an instant cure all for you. my oldest son and i had some problems when he was around the same age and i said some things that were far worse than what you said. luckily, we put those things behind us and have a good relationship today. he's now 35 and successful and i'm very proud of him. i would try baby steps, write her a letter, call her once a wk. just to chat, let her know you care about her and love her. i wouldn't keep apologizing over and over, if she's not ready to accept that it isn't going to help either of you, it will just cause more pain for you both. let her know you'll always be there for her and she has your support. she is still young and time heals all wounds. for both your sakes i hope she realizes this and can find it in her heart to forgive and rebuild a relationship. you have my prayers and best wishes.|`|cqHVoI3aaa	It sounds like you screwed up as much as she did, almost.

I rule.|`|y6vcfJ0paa	bargan with them say, " I know i messed up before but you see how well i'm doing now, if i finish off the school year with almost all A's, can please go back to public school?"

1fErIucgaa	Well how are his parents? Are his parents nice and understanding? If so, then he should just straight up tell them. I'm 17 and I have an older gay brother.. my mom just sort of knew he was gay and my mom told my dad.. at first my dad was crying and told my brother he had a disease. My mom totally accepted him. Soon, my dad began accepting him and now my parents both love my brother's boyfriend. There's nothing wrong with being gay and I hope his parents understand that. Tell him I said Good Luck!|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Parent's love should be unconditional and your friend should be forthright and honest with his parents, period. Holding back his preferences will probably break down his relationship with his parents whether they are good or bad. The sooner the better, too.It certainly will not be easy, but it must be done for all of their sakes. They may not accept it, but I am sure they love their son and  will eventually come to terms about it.|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	Say "Mom, Dad, I'm gay."|`|w1p43HbCaa	he should just go up to the parents and say,, well we need to talk. then explain to them that he's gay and that that's how he feels and it's not a phase and he can understand if they see him differently.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :D -- alex arias --|`|T0KHIFgaaa	"hey, mom, i'm gay!"|`|N58YMuuxaa	have him tattoo it on his arm, MOM DAD I'M GAY !|`|AwUN5uyIaa	hi mom and dad i'm gay|`|89D08K16aa	Of course, a "friend" wants to know.<br>  I am bisexual myself, and i tried this out with my parents.<br>  You should sit them down, and tell them straight off that you are gay.<br>  Mums tend to accept it more than dads.<br>  So don't be shocked for whatever comes to you...i mean him.|`|JGppUccmaa	"Mom, Dad, I poisoned your coffee this morning.

If it's his property, you guys will have to move.|`|0rjKnY7Eaa	It sounds like your mother needs to see a lawyer and fast. its not healthy for any of you to be living in that situation and your father has alot of issues he needs to resolve. Your mother may want him to leave but could be afraid to go ahead with it, support your mother however you can, even though she is the parent she may need assurance from her child that she is doing the right thing. If she has been with this man for a long time, even after the fact she may still have feelings (not necessarily love) for him or at least sympathy if she keeps him around. Its hard to see people in a bad sitation and not care, but your father got himself there and should pay for the consequences of his actions. At the end of the day no one deserves to live like that and the best thing you mom can do is to take legal action , get a restraining order if she has too, the abuse does not have to be physical abuse to matter, emotional and verbal abuse can be just as damaging.  i hope you can find a solution

I would feel so sorry for anyone you married. You seem no negative and miserable you would make anyone unhappy. <br>  <br>  Life is what you make of it. Married or Single.|`|88549bab6924439810ef4c92c64e5634aa	No, that isn't marriage...that's a poor relationship.<br>  <br>  A marriage is when you have someone that<br>  <br>  1. Always has your back<br>  2. You can always be silly with<br>  3. Knows everything about you<br>  4. Knows how to make your toes curl <br>  5. Is always there when you feel lonely or need to talk<br>  6. Shares your burdens<br>  7. Makes you smile and feel grateful for them<br>  8. Compromises<br>  9. Gives you great legal benefits<br>  10.

Then if things haven't changed, then it would be time to get out.  But don't be so willing to throw it all away because you are feeling this way right now.  Everybody goes through lulls, and every day isn't going to be this wild passionate love affair like it was when you were dating.  However, there definitley should be more to it than what you've described.  Also, remember marriage takes work on both sides and 2 major factors are communication and trust.  Without the 2, there really isn't much of a foundation.  It's sad but true that once a couple decides to marry they either had such big expectations and then feel disappointed or they begin to take the other for granted.  Which is why communication is key.  Remember, he can't read your mind anymore than you can read his.  Good Luck!|`|DzAFT8VDaa	If this is your marriage, then you should be depressed. Marriage offers freedom in ways that being single can't. Yes, both states of matrimony have their ups, but they also have their downs.<br>  <br>  Suffice it to say if you chose your partner wisely, being with someone you can depend on, be yourself with is an amazing thing to be part of. Maybe you aren't cut out for marriage. If not, that's ok. Just be honest with yourself and your partner.<br>  <br>  If you are bored, you are boring. YOU are responsible for your experiences. Do you think your wife is bored by you, too? <br>  <br>  If you guys don't want to talk to each other and LISTEN, go to counseling and work on your marriage, then you need to split up. You aren't doing each other any favors by staying. If you have kids, then you need to do what is best for THEM.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f8240cd0e6b54863a050b702a65c786caa	Well, if you think like that,don't get married.<br>  I on the other hand, would not feel complete as a person if I was not married, paying a mortgage and raising children. <br>  Making love to and then waking up beside someone you love is more satisfying than the illusion of sexual freedom you seem to have. I still have fun, ride my bike, go drinking when I want, I do make sacrifices, but they're not pointless and we are working together to create a secure future for ourselves. <br>  I would think that you are young and immature, and probably have seen some bad marriages, but I hope one day you'll find the right person and be as happy as I am.|`|TKf6z1vHaa	Sounds like you got married for the wrong reasons. The person that you choose to marry should be the one that you want to spend the rest of your life with and you can't wait to sleep with them everynight and do everything with them. Maybe you should rethink why you are married, b/c for most people it is bliss.|`|AA11097184	Yes, i agree. The list can become endless. Its always easy to find what we want to find.<br>  Instead, marriage gives something which could never be purchased, borrowed or stolen.<br>  Marriage is connection of two souls. Its something beyond physical connections what has been listed. Marriage teaches both the sides to have adaptability, patience, sacrifice, empathy, concerns. And above all it gives you chance to CHANGE (change for Good).<br>  By giving away something, you will get much more.<br>  And when you are alone in your life, marriage brings in the real support - emotional.............|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Ooooohhhhhh my yes......She feels so perfect against you...No. 2 Thank ALL the stars she is more than a dream and is here to hold in the morning....No.3   You ALWAYS find a way to make it fun....No.4 You get a chance to use your imagination to keep things good.

For one reason, just to know that the same person you fell in love with is strong enough person to stay with you until the end of time and that they want to is amazing. Your life doesn't stop when you get married it reaches a new state. You have someone to try things with you, just be sure to find someone who is willing to do new things and life is so much better when the person you love is beside you.<br>  <br>  I think only having one person is great because if there wasn't just one you would end up spending the rest of your life meeting new guys, dumping them, putting up with their crap, and the lies they will tell you. It's a life long cycle of chaos. <br>  <br>  Being married can be fun, it just takes some effort and it's not as hectic as it seems, who says you have to have children? <br>  Also it just feels good to know that he/she will be there to hold you when no one else will and at the end you'll be happy with your decision.|`|oJhr79cgaa	well then maybe you shouldnt be married. I love sleeping with my husbday every night. i wouldnt be able to sleep without him. And i love waking up and seeing his face every morning. I had a cheap wedding and  loved every minute of it! I dont do the same thing every day. my husband and i both have our own freedom because we trust each other enough to give each other freedom. sacrifices happen in a marriage. It has to to help the marriage work. and if you fight a lot then like i said maybe you shouldnt be married/|`|4ISfl1k5aa	It really depends on how you look at it, most people are looking for that someone special to spend their lives together do you really want to be alone|`|wseP86qSaa	You haven't met the right person yet, when you do, it will all make sense.

dFHsAXDMaa	Welcome to being a teenager sweety... as a woman, nurse, mother, and former teen ( not that long ago) and a high school cheering coach. I will tell you this just happens.... we grow up we start to mature and leave the friends who choose not to grow up behind.... you need to make new friends positive friends and enjoy high school get good grades and go on to college..they will eventually grow up to maybe not till Junior year when they are thinking oh crap you were right we needed to work hard in school because colleges look at freshman and sophomore and junior year grades....and get involved in school activities and club and sports all of it will look good on college applications and will get you involved and able to make new friends who have the same interests and goals in life as you... good luck... I am not saying do not talk to old friends just make new ones who have goals and are not hanging around being useless through out high school and never let someone else's opinion hold you back from being the best person you can be.|`|pbjYK3sgaa	find yourself a new group of friends...if they want to act like a different person at school then let em...that should tell you that they're not the right people to be with. Just understand that friends come and they go at one point in life. Do what you feel makes you happy. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|3H0hluVoaa	That attitude annoys me too. Whenever this happens try to change the topic to something that you all like or bounds you together.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  If they are not interested in school and education then they will drag you down.  Don't let them rule your life.  You are better off making other friends and stop talking to them.  They might create problems for you but by simply ignoring them, would do the trick.<br>  <br>  When I was in secondary school, I used to be picked on because my friends were from different cultures but I never cared.  My friends helped me through school as I helped them and I am still in contact with few of them.<br>  <br>  You look like an Intelligent person and you know what you want, so you go out and make new friends and enjoy your school.  These kids are not worth wasting your time over, specially if they make you feel guilty.  They are not your friends.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|xGf8q75Paa	1- If you are comfortable with letting them know how you feel, tell them. Tell them that you are feeling bad about their attitudes, etc. <br>  <br>  2- If you don't want to tell them how you feel ( I totally understand if you don't), and you really feel like it is time to move on, consider making new friends and keeping your old friends as well. If your old friends keep annoying you and being unkind, then slowly move away from them and start hanging out with your new friends more and more. <br>  <br>  I hope this works well for you. Always remember to be kind to your friends even if you don't like them. You can kindly let them know how you feel or start making new friends to avoid the bad influence of your old ones.|`|5iITvAIiaa	Obviously you are not clicking.  Friends enjoy each others companion and SHARE things they like or interests.  Friends are not only when the clock strikes at a certain hour.  If you don't feel comfortable with them than find new friends that share your ideas and interests.  Plus, a friend accepts you for who you are and doesn't tease you or says mean things to you.|`|ZzAxCBy4aa	I think that you need to talk with your friends and tell them how you fee about them teasing you. i has the same problem and i confronted my friends and told them i was upset with what they were saying to me about me liking school! Because i love school. You should start hanging with different people, i did and now i have so many friends. i honestly don't think it matters who you hang out with as long as your having fun and your ok with the people you are around.  if your friends dont like you hanging around other people then tuff bananas to them because they are just jealous and SELFISH. they need to understand that friends are great but their also not the only people you have to hang around with everyday of your life!<br>  I say hang with who ever you want as long as it makes you happy, and they accept you for who you are. Make new friends your in highschool now.. things always change!! Have fun with your life, dont hold back!<br>  Hope this helped! :)|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Well, if your friends does not accept for who you are, then maybe you should end their friendship.  The best thing for you right now is to find another group of people who are like you and interests as you.
dFHsAXDMaa	Does it really matter? he is your friend right you should just except him Gay, Straight or any other way that is what a real friend would do.. he will tell you when he is ready...maybe he is still trying to figure that out himself...... just be a friend.|`|tg89r7ZJaa	no one is going to read this this is beyond tooooooooooooooooooo long!|`|K5IOSGXAaa	I don't know about gay, but weirdo stalker type comes to mind.... and totally annoying as well.

By the looks of it, he might be something even worse...<br>  EMO!!! <br>  <br>  im so sorry :P|`|1LmhxjoOaa	tons of guys wear skinny jeans, but only with a big shirt, if its skinny, he is gay. it depends if he is close friends with the person on myspace. but it still seems too close. its like 75% that he is gay|`|lNT22A0Caa	nahhh it's not gay....more like "bromance" as you said.<br>  but with the skinny jeans, modelesque photos, and excessive pouring out of feelings, he might be more than a little bit emo. haha.
oQq1rqDVaa	Leave this situation alone and see how it develops.  I think that your friend may have done you a favour without her knowing it!  Thank your lucky starts and good luck!|`|D5PqofNMaa	As a teenager, relationships come and go. Friends are not the same though, don't risk your friendship over a guy. If every girl in the school likes him, then you must have gotten on the bandwagon.<br>  <br>  -|`|cKKUViZCaa	Stay away... there are a lot of great guy/girls out there to date, but true friends are harder to come by.<br>  It's your turn to be a true friend, and keep HIM out of your mind..|`|KBFOaEMJaa	wy don't try find another boy? there are allot of them outthere! goodnes...|`|51pUgWvGaa	do you even know why you like him other then that he is hott and everyone else wants him? atleast your friend is showing an initiative to get to know him as a person, even though she may very well be A STALKER... If you like him then get to know him, if things work out then cool. But I think you are getting way too ahead of yourself. Get to know him and be his friend if the relationship moves onto another level, then cool. But if you throw youself at him and make it apparent that you are chasing him, you WILL LOSE your friend and probably your chance to be with him.
znZxydq5aa	wow mate it seemz like ur n some deep **** here....so i sugest that you just sit ther and talk 2 ur parentz and dnt hold back any emotionz onceso ever love and just turn reed and let it all out dnt hold back anything scream if u have to just tell them how u feel tell them about how they wont listen 2 u but they listen to ther drug convicted grandson and all that crap. just bring it up to there memory about how good of a kid you are and i garuntee that they will belive the bloody hell out of u!
GYkfqnMfaa	Sometimes, space is necessary in a relationship. It helps you sort your thoughts and emotions out, and sometimes it actually makes you realize how much you love the other person. Looks like that has happened with you. I say call him. It sounds like you've been apart for less than three weeks. If he's managed to find a new girl within such a short time, it just means he's been wanting to get out of your relationship all this while and wasn't worth your time to begin with. If he truly loves you, he'd have waited. 3 weeks isn't a long time!<br>  <br>  gt man, I'm a dude and I thumbed you down.|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	Ugh that's the worse. That actually just happened to me. I would inform him of your decision and apologize....you thought you needed this time alone but in actuality you miss him more than ever and you wanna talk your problems out with him rather than "running away" in a sense. <br>  Good luck|`|WEM5n41Oaa	Call him.  Talk to him about it.  Maybe you still need more space.  Maybe you want to get back together with him.  Talk to him and see how you feel then.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well just call him see what he tells you|`|tfO69Y1Haa	How long have you two been apart?<br>  I think that you should still wait for those three weeks to end, because you may end up wanting space again or changing your mind. Try to stick it out for those three weeks, it shouldn't go by too slowly. You never know how you might feel in a week from now.|`|NuaXMa5waa	dude if u said i need space, how is he suppose to know when ur better?<br>  u MUST do the contacting. but brace yourself, he could have found somebody else.<br>  tell him u REALLY missed him and your all better, then how he was so sweet to wait like that!|`|cmK9Go1gaa	I would wait a little longer, but since it wasn't his idea you have all the right to contact him, but make sure he knows you missed him.|`|73JqH4euaa	Yes. You should call him. He's probably missing you too.|`|Sma3ekSOaa	I would call him|`|6661b8da17d2a54e6d2bd4d96c492adcaa	Well, maybe you should. I mean..he probably isn't going to contact you because your the one who asked him for the space. That's actually good that he is respecting your wishes. <br>  So, if you text, or call him or something, telling him that you've been missing him..I'm sure he'll appreciate it.<br>  <br>  Best of luckk. <br>  (:|`|HZgjUguWaa	you asked for the space now i suppose it's ok to go ahead & talk to him if he still wants anything to do w/you.

Continue the affair knowing full well he will NEVER be yours and that he will only be yours for a very limited time and just enjoy the way he makes you feel special ( which if you put as much effort into your marriage that you are into your affair you would probably find your husband would make you feel the exact same way ) .<br>  <br>  B. END the torrid tryst and PUT THE EFFORT INTO YOUR HUSBAND , to many people like you put the effort into affairs that could save your current marriage if you just started reliving the romance , you dont have to go to fancy resturaunts or spend loads of dough eating out and going out . Just grow up a little bit and start being sensual with your husband and more attentative and your husband will start caring again , run hot baths light some candles , do body massages with oils , make love and LEAVE THE OTHER MAN ALONE.....|`|wseP86qSaa	I don't understand the way you say some things, but please remind yourself that you are pretty much having a fantasy relationship with your lover. Of course it's so much better than the relationship with your husband because you haven't lived in reality with the lover yet. Over time, the same kinds of issues will come up with your lover as you have with your husband. You are confusing a fantasy relationship with your real relationship. And the fantasy is almost always better because in your head you can lead it wherever you want it to go. I say give the love the ax (figuratively speaking) and work on making your REALITY better.|`|vHjYw1txaa	Sounds like your lover is using you.

If it is a problem, explain it to both of them without stuttering.  :)|`|oqY21L4Zaa	myself Id shrug it off,its not any more than a friendly hug that you both know about.she knows where your interest is and is trying to show her your comfortable with it.|`|0ixYCtKjaa	well, if you really feel like it was a big deal, and the look on <br>  her face was depression/confussion then the best thing to <br>  do is tell her the truth..the worst thing that could go wrong is<br>  that she wouldnt understand! :)|`|EaZHm58eaa	be polite, shrug it off it'll go hush unless of course your crush is a flush-crush. if not, expect a little understanding. after a while the "hugger"will fold.|`|Wud0BJZOaa	Just go along with. But don't take it that serious. It was probably just nothing.|`|3vBALAlaaa	Just ask her why she's hugging you in front of your crush... if she denies, don't be too mad, she probably is jealous that you like someone, when she probably likes you, so just confront her|`|4T9fZzITaa	well when she hugs you give her a one armed hug <br>  and dont make it seem like a big deal just brush it off and continue as how you were. that would make it seem unimportant and your content on keeping your attention towards your crush.|`|Bx6xTLRbaa	Maybe your friend is trying to get your crush jealous. It shouldn't be a big deal..it was just a hug but if your crush likes you a lot back then I guess she would be mad. Just forget the hug and continue paying all of your attention to your crush :)|`|HZgjUguWaa	you hug them back & expect some maturity from your alleged crush.|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	Just ignore it.  Hugs these days mean nothing anymore.|`|JHWQDWfQaa	ahh.  mixed signals..<br>  maybe shes helping u get ur crush jelous|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	Sounds like your friend likes you and is trying to make your crush intimidated/jealous/wanting her to back off(even if shes not coming on)<br>  <br>  You can let her hug you, but not for too long. just a quick hug is fine, if she tries to make it go longer, just remove your hands and stand there like a stunned mullet, your crush will probably laugh and see that you don't want to be hugging her anymore and that will give her the right idea.<br>  Or just dont hug her, go to hug her and if you see your crush just turn away or make some excuse so that you can walk off...|`|p4wdTloEaa	well if shes your good friend then obviously she would hug you and i don't' think there's anything wrong with that but if you don't feel comfortable then tell your friend that you don't want your crush to think that you and her are going out.|`|kqaZWgj2aa	Haha your friend wants you c0ck like whoa man.  She's probably just jealous you prefer the other girl to her, and gave you a hug in front of her as a big 'f*ck you' to the crush.|`|LMfYodo6aa	Nothing... Who cares? It was just a hug. I hug my boyfriend's friends. It's not a big deal.|`|axylPYftaa	at my school, girls and guys hug all the time. its how we greet each other.|`|cmK9Go1gaa	that depends...what kind of hug was it?|`|rY84Ap6Maa	infront of both of them explain.|`|qlhDCAPyaa	i htink the girl hugs u likes u and wants ur gf to leave u so she always keeps hugging u infront of ur gf
AA10520677	Divorce is very hard. Do what you can to save the marriage first, and get a divorce as a last resort. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, be smart and get higher education, or a job, something to be able to support you and your daughter after the divorce. Sign up for residency. <br>  <br>  If you really need to get away from him for awhile, move in with family until you figure otu what you want to do.

She seems like a really confusing girl, more confusing then most of us. She probably says "Hey (your name)" in person because she doesnt want you to think that she doesn't like you, but she's probably ignoring your myspace messages. She's probably doing this because she's too nice to just stop talking to you all together. Now I don't know why she wouldn't talk to you, but that might be the case. Also, it could be that she does like you but isn't responding to your myspace messages because she wants you to say something more... like make a move. But don't do it!!!! Or if you do, and she doesn't like you, please don't blame me. Like I said, she's waaay more confusing then most of us girls. She might just be playing you too. In a weird kind of way. So my answer makes about as much sense as your question. Hopefully you read the whole thing too :P<br>  <br>  I hope this helped you at least a little bit. Good luck!
qtdNwpd1aa	I think he did a good thing by leaving her alone which she had "changed" him and who he was just to stay the way they ended-up. Very inspiring. Very IN-to it, But like he said that "he wasn't himself" when he finally met her in person was probebly a sign they weren't ment to be. I like this story(Ha) i actually took the time to read it :) And Yes he did do the right thing! <33<br>  <br>  -Veronica.B|`|lFzXZQQDaa	I read that WHOLE thing, and didn't really understand the exact question.<br>  <br>  But I guess you did the right thing. and thats cool how you like writing.|`|S852p6SXaa	wtf? are you writing a book!|`|wIN9xHuRaa	Sure but i dint read it Hell no im readin dat much|`|c9f676588616bf588f7dfd5b30f60d96aa	Yawn! too long sorry.|`|HZgjUguWaa	yes he did|`|FSK1v5neaa	Holy crap.... I have never read anything so long on Yahoo till now... I think he did a good thing and who knows? Maybe the biking trip helped him get over some of that grief.|`|L0Jrx5anaa	What exactly was the thing you are asking about? The trip I think is a great idea but doing it to see a girl is kind of pathetic.|`|evW3yXwwaa	Way too long!|`|mIh685iBaa	write a lot less|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	Yes he did the right thing. And that girl f-ing stupid. Are you this "guy" because your a good writer.|`|U5dCFomCaa	that was a nice story.. are you this guy you speak of? really sweet.. i guess it was a fulfilling experience for the guy and a lesson learned in life? hmm?? not sure what you're asking..|`|WAkUBPORaa	Yes and no. Yes because the guy loved her and wanted to be with her. He waited till he was 18 too. No because he just went to her she never invited him. The girl may of MOVED and then the guy would be lost forever with no girl.|`|f0vZRJCgaa	i think he did a great thing and you sound like a great guy and i think this girl was dumb to let you go like that the least she could have done was be friends|`|J2yIkKGZaa	awesome|`|Cs2urP26aa	A really sweet story!!!|`|ZKsSnT64aa	Im sorry but I dont answer book sized questions.<br>  <br>  I think I sprained my eye|`|GBSP9BLHaa	Wow it sounds like he really cares. It sounds like he did the right thing, but it also depends if she feels something for him like he feels for her. Interesting story.|`|P9eAP5Zbaa	Did you know writing or talking in third person is one of the first signs of insanity. Just thought I'd let you know :) and yes he did do a good thing but then again its not up to me  to know if it actually was a good thing  its up to the guy if he felt as if he did the right thing. hope that helps :) and good luck :)|`|kqaZWgj2aa	I don't understand... is there another page or something?  Did he do a good thing by biking 1300 miles?  I guess?  Being healthy is definitely a plus.  It sounds slightly stalkerish if he biked all that distance just for a girl who blocked his ims.  But thats just my take.|`|p4wdTloEaa	wow that was long damn okay so yea i think he did a good thing but i think he was a little too into her there would probably be many other girls that would want this guy|`|pCOkTBA0aa	wow. i read that whole thing. so yeah. i think that the guy did a good thing.|`|uwqCtMQ0aa	That is soo sweet! That sounds like a wonderful thing to do! I would love it if a guy did that for me!
zxQT3Uo5aa	Correct the lie.
ghz5D5iLaa	It should not be awkward. She has one and you can tell her that. You can tell her a better name for it. She is at the age where she should learn all of this anyway. She needs to learn about her own body and how it works. Never fell awkward in talking to a child. They should feel that you are comfortable so they are and will come to you.<br>  <br>  A good book for her is The Care and Keeping of Me. It is from American Girl. You can buy it online, at Bathand Bodyworks or Target. Check it out.

vZDUwF0Naa	i undertsand how u feel, me to i ws in same situation at school :( so i can undertsand ur piont 100%. its defintly alot harder in high school bc people are nt so understanding or considerate of peoples feelings. i think you should forget the fact that people think ur emo and people say u neevr talk. try to get soem more confidence, i knw at first u might think oh no way. bt it can help if u see ur doctor about confidence infront of people who are nt ur friends, they can seriously help bring u to be nt so shy anymore. or be straight and upfront and just go for it and talk to people dnt worry wat they will think, be confident and belive in urself that there no better than you, i hope this helps x

dFHsAXDMaa	Michael you are not a looser you just realize that while college is about having fun and experiencing a new found freedom while working hard to get your education... partying all the time and feeling like crap the next day and not really concentrating on your homework and studies is not worth it.. it is a wast of tuition and hard earned money if you are not concentrating on doing your best in school.. but it is okay to go out once and a while like weekends and you can definitely find friends who know there is more to life than getting drunk and having casual sex with random girls because as a nurse I can tell you that that can actually kill you now a days with stds and hiv etc...and drunk people do not always remember to use protection right? <br>  <br>  unfortunately I will tell you you will most likely find this to be a problem at your new school too.. as they will be college kids and sophomores as you start the next school year. but when I was in college freshman year was like this... and sophomore year it all starts to get a little old and people find other things to do.. good luck you will survive and make friends who realize there is definitely more to life.|`|nSMizwOqaa	you don't have to drink.|`|sI3mx29naa	Lets focus on whats most important here...Your schooling I would say...To many college kids focus to much on partying that the real reason they are there...You, or your parents are spending a lot of money for your education...I say get involved on another group...Certainly not everyone parties...<br>  And you don't have to go along with the crowd...Be your own man?woman...Remember, you are the one who said that partying "just really isn't you".|`|KBFOaEMJaa	since when part of having fan is drinking ?you may get soft drinks etc.|`|8Njdzwi0aa	I'm the same way. If I go out I won't drink but have a red bull, LOL and I'll try to make the best of it but it's NOT fun being around drunk idiots ; ) Just hang in there until you switch schools. Trust me there are a lot of "cool" people who don't like getting trashed and sick of that lame lifestyle, at a bigger school you will have more luck finding people like you.|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	I definitely agree that going to parties without drinking at all feels pretty pathetic, but you certainly don't need to get completely wasted, right?  Why not try to work on improving your ability to drink without getting wasted?
1k7LIZVWaa	Maybe.  He sounds like a creep to me.  I would tell him it is not his concern.  If he brings it up again, I would report him to HR.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	he should,nt be asking questions like that to you or anyone else by him being married.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	sounds like he is interested to me. By asking you that question, he is trying to justify some question he has in his own head. I wouldnt call it "a pass" but rather curiosity.|`|AA11292270	He is either making a pass at you or he is extremely nosy.  Either way it's inappropriate.|`|bXmRWbEdaa	Probably, but not necessarily.|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	maybe he wants to here what is happily married to some people|`|29WFvvNPaa	yes.|`|AA10520677	It's okay to be wary of this type of question. It could be an innocent question or it could be a pass. Just make a mental note that he had asked you that and keep on eye on him if he tries to make anymore passes at you. If not then you know it was innocent.|`|M43M4KZxaa	no,he is just curious.maybe he sees you as a happy and fulfilled person.i think his relationship is not that great.if he wants to confide,better decline.|`|AA11017714	No, you tool!<br>  <br>  It means you read way too much inferential meta-messages into an otherwise oblivious co-worker simply chatting you up.<br>  <br>  Don't be so vain.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Minding other people's business, does not imply he is making a pass at you. It simply implies he has no manners.|`|tKb7i5jtaa	Maybe, it depends how he said it and what his reaction was.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Not really he might  just be curious.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	No. its a simple question. dont flatter yourself so much.|`|hawq3Fneaa	It means he wants to get in your pants without the danger of any kind of commitment and extremely low chance of getting caught.<br>  <br>  These kind of guys want to screw women other than their wife, but do not want to leave their wife for a lot of different reasons.  So they prey on married women who have as much or more to lose than they do, reducing the chance that his sex toy will run to his wife when he is through using you for his sexual pleasure.  He also knows that you will be as careful not to get caught as he will be.<br>  <br>  Women getting involved with these kind of guys almost always get hurt in more ways than you can imagine.  While he is screwing you he will play with you mind leading you to believe you will both be happier together.  <br>  <br>  If you start thinking about ending it, he will make you feel guilty and bring you down emotionally.  While he still needs you for his sexual satisfaction he will get you to cancel other plans risking your being caught, but he will never give up anything that will make his wife suspicious.  <br>  <br>  And when he finds a new play girl or decides continuing sex with you may get him caught, he will dump you without notice or regard to your feelings.  And all too often, it places your job in danger.<br>  <br>  Oh yes, he is making a pass, but it is a pass you want to fumble or let fly by.  Avoid this coworker if you want to avoid being unhappy and hurt.|`|wseP86qSaa	Not necessarily. You said he was a coworker, not a boss. So maybe you two have have had a friendly relationship and talk a lot at work. That stuff comes up naturally. I guess context would make different too. Like, did he say that and wink at you?<br>  <br>  And next time he asks, then 'jokingly' ask him back.."are you making a pass at me?"|`|jpimg8doaa	Did you look unhappy?  Does he normally ask you personal questions?  This doesn't seem like the kind of discussion that should be taking place at work.  Did it make you uncomfortable or did it make you feel special?  Uncomfortable means it was non of his business and he should not be asking you these kinds of questions.<br>  Special-Maybe you looked unhappy and he cared about you because you shared personal experiences before?<br>  You didn't give us much to go on?<br>  Do you flirt with him at work?  Maybe this is why he is asking?|`|6mr4OjQjaa	Not necessarily. He maybe is just trying to be caring and understanding. Maybe if your facial expression is gloomy all the time, obviously, he would wonder if your marriage is a happy one. If he is trying to make a pass, observe his every move even his stares.|`|AA11097184	Absolutely no........from the above statement. However, you have to assess. He may be concerned about you.<br>  After all, nothing wrong in answering that question. But if he gets more involved against your wishes, you may warn him or report it to management.|`|ed05ZIrsaa	Kell is inappropriate with her comment and should be reported. <br>  <br>  Anyways, it doesn't necessarily mean he is making a pass at you. Just take it as it is, a question, and be on guard.|`|ceJazsZCaa	Depends on his motifs. Has he been flirty with you or given you an indication that hes interested? Maybe he is unhappily married and is looking for a way to talk to someone about it.|`|jij9Fa9waa	i would think the context of the question the location asked, and how it was asked. Is he married? I would just let it go, do not get curious, you will be the one that gets burned!|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	You would know, does he appear to be a creepy person? or a nice man with no evil intentions?<br>  <br>  my best guess is that he is creepy, and I would advise to totally avoid him|`|EzfZoQ1Taa	If your gut says he was hitting on you, he probably was. Without the entire context, no one on here could possibly tell you for sure.|`|AA11521623	Not realy . He might be curious in a parental way or just making conversation.|`|K2KBgy3Maa	it depends. if he sounded surprised/disappointed, then it was. if he said "oh, that's great! i *blah blah blah*" back, then it's all good.|`|gayDcP57aa	i would say that it depends on if he talks to you alot and how he talks to you whether he was making a pass or not|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I don't think so.

b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	You can file for temporary child spport if you two are seperated. If youre in the US then contact either your local legal aid association fr fre legal help if you qualify or contact a local womens help group that will help you out here too. Your ex will not have any choice when it comes to child support. Just dont ever agree nor sign anything without having some legal official looking at it first. good luck|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	No, you do'nt have to be divorce. I have heard of people getting temporary orders of support while they're separated or in the process of divorce.<br>  He really has no choice in the matter, he cannot say "I won't pay". If the court orders it, which they will if you have full custody and he's the biological father, then he HAS to pay.<br>  The least expensive way to file for divorce is if its an uncontested divorce. You can do it yourself through a document prep service, you don't need a lawyer.|`|ibaLRXY2aa	Try looking in the phone book for the Legal Aid society in your area. (May be called something different.) If you meet certain income requirements, they will help you file your divorce for free.|`|6mr4OjQjaa	Google your state information on divorce!|`|jpimg8doaa	File and worry about the bills later.  Isn't that what most very low income people do?  It is called Government Assistance.  That was only supposed to be a temporary thing but has lasted for decades.  So, take it for granted like everyone else and abuse the system so that other people can pay for things for you.|`|wseP86qSaa	Good question. Would you let me know when you have an answer? If you are very low income and want to go to college, you can probably go for free, just complete the FAFSA app for government aid. You could easily become a certified Nursing assistant or LPN or something that would help you to make enough money to get buy, even within a year or two.|`|vHjYw1txaa	You need to contact legal aid in your area.  They offer low cost to free lawyers for divorce.  They go by income.  And the judge will make him support his kids even if your man says no.  If the courts have to, they will take it out of his pay check before he ever sees his own check.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Do yourself a favor, go to the courts, seek information on filing for child support..alimony before you get divorce..file divorce papers in court..seek legal aid.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Do your homework.  Obviously, you have a computer.  See what the requirements are in your state.  You may be able to have him served with papers for little more than a filing fee.  I am not sure about the child support, morally, he should pay for child support.  You may be able to go after him for support from the time you separated until the process was complete if he doesn't pay anything.  Your county Social Service Dept should be able to help you.
rQfzifT7aa	Depends on what you call normal. In today's society there are many fetishes. There are more and more swinging couples than ever before. Some say it can keep a marriage together, some say it will ruin a marriage. That has to be up to the two of you. <br>  In most marriages, after a few years sex becomes just routine.  It may still be wonderful but after you have had the same thing so many times, it just becomes sex. There is no spice, or excitement in it anymore. It just happens. And sometimes the act of seeing your spouse being pleasured by another person is just the ticket to get the spark back into your marriage.<br>  <br>  Look up the word cuckold in the dictionary<br>  <br>  It is a sight that has alot of people on it that are into the same type things|`|AA12302228	if hes ok with it<br>  carry on<br>  where do you live<br>  hahaha|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	Level one 122 points<br>  <br>  This is made up.<br>  <br>  Have a nice imagination.|`|uXtonVN4aa	wat??? uh?<br>  <br>  thats crazy|`|bV7yfxpKaa	So you gave him permission to cheat.  Yea you.  And by example, you showed him how accepting you are.  So he can come home from cheating with another woman and you'll accept him, and accept what he may bring you.  Heck, he was willing to accept what you might give him.  The gifts that keep giving.  What a couple.  You deserve each other.  You could get adjoining hotel rooms and go back and forth so you could all share.  You're disgusting.|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	It is probably because he is also cheating on you. <br>  <br>  Karma is a bi*th<br>  <br>  EDIT: Worse, he may be cheating on you with a man. Wouldn't that be a blow to the ego, turning your husband gay.<br>  <br>  Hm...|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Means he most likely expected it and you will get it back.|`|pWoxMohbaa	He has probably been having sex with other women behind your back as well. If by chance he hasn't, it simply just made him feel like he could and now he's happy that he can have sex with you as well as every other woman. He was probably turned on because he no longer feels guilty.|`|Run7dyraaa	you are really messed up and you have a messed up marriage and a messed up life. I hope you don't intend to have any kids, because they will be messed up too. Get your life together girl.|`|M43M4KZxaa	there were cases about husbands urging their wives to have sex with other man as long as they know it and know the identity of the lover. this is not normal but men like your husband exist.it adds to their sex drive and make their encounter with their wives more passionate.they end up convincing their wives about the set-up.you were shock because you expect hostility from him.both of you discover something.it might suit you for now.but what if you decided to end your adultorous ways.will you let your husband talk you into having another lover?|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Maybe now all three of you can simply get into the bed together. I have heard there are both men and women who are turned on by this type of behavior. Too each his own, if you like it i love it. However, I do not understand anyone cheating! And sleeping with the boss no less. Wow, you are a charm. Just remember what goes around comes around; so don't be surprised when your husband begins sleeping with another woman.|`|29WFvvNPaa	It means that you just gave him permission to bang other chicks and he's happy about it.<br>  <br>  he might be into group stuff.  Ask your boss if he wouldn't mind.  Your kind of lucky.  Unless he's gay.|`|fc2633d8f192d5530fac717c9c7ca3e9aa	Wow Cindy Rodriguez how nice to put your whole name here. Why don't you list your addres, telephone and boss's name too?|`|NScOteNraa	whores cheat, its wrong.|`|oauYuhvDaa	The whole thing sounds disgusting to me.  Where have all the morals gone?  It amazes me the things people consider to be "ok" in this world.  <br>  If nothing else it would hurt me that my husband wasn't even concerned about it.  A man should have just a smidge of jealousy.  It shows he cares.|`|bdJXEjzXaa	that is hoooot|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Funny thing you mentioned this because I am reading a book and there is this couple that gets the kicks by the same thing.  The husband hires a PI to watch his wife getting banged by different men and she knows because the PI said one day she winked at him.|`|fkmCo1WPaa	u dont deserve him and if have to cheat. whore|`|lHWJljNPaa	Wow...that is very strange...maybe your husband's just....freaky?|`|AA11638054	Hey......I don't think that's cool.....You shouldn't of done it behind his back either.....if you are wanting something else either have the balls enough to tell your husband or let him have sex with who ever he wants to cause that would be fair.|`|gplfqOEHaa	Probably he wants to sleep with other women. And if you did it for money, then he probably wants you to sell yourself more often. Or both.<br>  <br>  Personally, I feel sex to be very sacred and see it as a gift of marriage. Special. Why marry if there is nothing special about it, why not just live together? So, if someone I love cheats, I will definitely won't be happy with it. Probably would want an end as I don't do it myself.<br>  <br>  But I also understand that in today's world life is not perfect. Because of which I believe in polygamy and a more happier life rather than a busy life. Just enough work and more fun with my wives. <br>  <br>  Wives because to be honest, we men are at times like grown up children. We need to be loved and taken care of. And at times its not easy to handle a husband, family, a professional life(my wives will be my business partners), hobbies and home. Thats why I have left the decision of how many wives I should have, unto my first one, then second(when she will come) and so on. I will be OK with one but they don't seem to agree.<br>  <br>  If you don't prefer an open relationship, I would suggest you talk with your husband.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|kziMijsyaa	Wow thats pretty crazy. To be honest though, it doesn't wsurprise me. I have researched more into peoples turn ons and likes and dislikes. It would seem that hell of alot more people - maybe 7/10 are into some kind of kinky fantasy/roleplay/interest - your husband may like it but it sounds like he may also be cheating. If you can cope with that and you both enjoy it then you may just be a simple case of the Swingers! A lot of married people become swingers but not in all cases this works out. There can be alot of jealousy between people because of it. I just hope you don't have any children about because this could potentially ruin your marriage.|`|R9ikVxzRaa	I have a feeling that your husband is sleeping around as well and now that he knows you are doing it too, he no longer has a guilty concsious.|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Yes its a demonstrated fact in evolutionary sexual biology in fact when a male bird sees his female partner impregnated by another male he quickly knock him off and ejaculates into his partner. But men human tend to brutally rape their partner after insemination by another male. You probably (80% chance) that you do not have kids. Be careful because your husband will snap If you did have children your husband most likely would have attacked you and probably killed your boss.....which you are sexually attracted to because he has a dominate socioeconomic position over you which women find extremely attractive in men. usually their bosses.|`|WzusAmjYaa	You commited adultry! You should be ashaimed!|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Nope not normal, not that I would ever do that to my husband but if I did and he caught me, I think he would actually kill at least the other man and would leave me.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	To each his own, honey. As long as everybody knows the deal and is okay with it, go for it.|`|hMSVmJN5aa	your husbands a submissive loser...poor dude|`|Z2HiL0zXaa	That means he doesnt love you anymore. <br>  <br>  Congrats, you ****!|`|w5l7De7Daa	that sounds like a great situation<br>  but it'll ruin your marriage|`|eBlG9Yzbaa	eww|`|wseP86qSaa	Wow, that was a very steamy question. I don't even know what to say about that. I guess it's better he's turned on by that than something really sick like pedophilia. When you guys are not all turned on by this, does he express any emotion to you about it? Have you told him you're sorry? What does he say?|`|qrGLcTh4aa	hmmm.... how funny, my business has an office whore too. If he's smart he'll dump your a*s.|`|ASq7LSggaa	im so inlove with my boyfriend and just thinking about this pisses me off i hope ur boss isnt married because his wife sure doesnt deserve that but u, you sure as hell do...... divorce ur husband if ur not happy people look down on people like u and ur a home wrecker and its people like u that causes divorces..... u should be a shame u are a shame!!!!|`|FCRjn23taa	Although it probably still isn't considered 'the norm', there are many couples that find it exciting that a third person is in the picture pleasuring their spouse. Sometimes, one prefers to watch their spouse be intimate with the third person, sometimes all three like to engage in things together, and, as you already know, some are turned on by just the idea that their spouse had sex with someone else. If you are up for it, I think you should sit down with your husband and discuss what happened. I'm alittle 'up in the air', though, because your husband had no problem 'going down' on you right after you had sex with your boss--meaning he wasn't minding taking in both your and your bosses excess fluids in his mouth. He also asked how big your boss was. Could your husband be bisexual? I've also heard of straight married men wanting to experiment sexually with another male. Perhaps your husband would be interested in acting out some fantasies he might have with you and the boss? <br>  <br>  Everyone has something different that tickles their fiddle. As long as the three of you are responsible and consenting adults. <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|Y86Is1W1aa	wow i never heard anything like that. i no if i was in that position i would of been so mad. especially if we were married. all i would say is you wouldn't be with me anymore. but thats really weird. but if i put myself in your shoes keep it up, he aint getting mad then do your thing.|`|DuTeclwuaa	[1] YOU ARE A DUDE.<br>  <br>  [2] you dream of being a cuck.<br>  <br>  [3] Cucks usually slither up from under the floorboards around here on TUESDAYS.<br>  <br>  [4] You are a felching homo.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|RMbZZpiEaa	haha shes exactly right now he can do what he wants. congratulations. he loved you enough to just sleep with you but you didnt love him now he is going to return the favor, haha hes probably with some chick right now lol|`|XY4tQuw6aa	you are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid why did you tell your co-worker????OMG did you do it awsome!!!!!(@ a motel ewwww) andf your husband must de very sick because it like he would like to see two girls makin out so thay like him likeing him likeing you sleeping with your boss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... your husband is sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)|`|jpimg8doaa	Make a suggestion like, "Want to watch." and see what he says.  Ask if you can also watch him with his lady friends.  Tell him you know about them and see what he says.  <br>  <br>  Looks like you have opened up a can of worms and just invited yourself to becoming a part of the swinger's club.  If you are into that, go for it.<br>  <br>  I think you are horrible for cheating in the first place.  I would have shot you both.  Then claimed temporary insanity|`|l5IjG90oaa	all of that was just weird. why don't you stop playing around and find one man to ****. you husvand is either insane, into group sex, or cheating on you|`|w7KWihEyaa	Your husband is a pathetic wuss and you're a disgusting whore.

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Get out of that relationship asap because he is a control freak. You are describing classic signs of domestic violence, which is not limited to only physical violence. But it will likely reach that point soon. You deserve so much more than that.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Dump the loser.<br>  <br>  He may be feeling guilt about convincing you to have a abortion and (WRONGLY) taking it out on you. If he can't "cope with you" when your in your time of need, obviously he isn't ready for marriage, or a relationship as it's not all sunshine and rainbows. It sounds like HE is insecure, childish, selfish and insensitive, which are BOY things, not a man. A man would take care of his child and own up to his responsibilities. Him being "great" 90% of the time doesn't make up for the 10% of verbally abusive things he does. You deserve someone who loves you and will support you no matter what, not this loser.|`|W9GTkt3Jaa	not worth it.<br>  period.<br>  he's trying to control you. you aren't a puppet! tell him you're human and need time to grieve. plus, with him degrading you like that by calling you selfish and lazy, what the hell is that? is that how someone who loves you would describe you? no.|`|Likst1Mxaa	he sounds like a wanker.<br>  <br>  get out now :) while you still can.<br>  <br>  you never deserve being shouted at by anyone. your fiance should have been supportive about the abortion too. <br>  <br>  you can do better.|`|5TLGa3awaa	Don't walk away from this guy, RUN away from him!  Your fiance displays classic signs of being an abuser and believe me when I say that he's not going to change and things won't get better.  Believe me, I've been there.  He's not a nice guy that has a temper sometimes, he's an abuser that is sometimes nice.  Don't settle or think that things are ok because everything seems fine 90% of the time.  The number gets lower and lower as time passes by.  Once you're married and he knows it's harder for you to leave things will get worse and they will get worse quickly.  Consider it a blessing that he's already shown you his true colors and don't waste anymore time wondering if you should go or stay.  I think deep down you know what he's doing is not right or else you wouldn't be posting this.  The same thing happened to me, I would doubt myself before I doubted him.  I believed everything he said until one day I realized that I was afraid of the man I was sleeping next to and that I wasn't happy.  I was just trying to change someone and feeling that I was somehow responsible for "saving" him.  Well, you can't save someone, they can only save themselves and abusers hardly ever realize that they need to change.  Everyone else is the problem, it's never them.  HE'S the problem but don't expect him to realize that.  Just get away from him and find someone that doesn't take so much effort to be with.  He's out there.  If anything, it's better to be alone than to be with an abusive partner.  Learn to love yourself and the person who will truly love you will come to you.  This guy isn't that person.  Good luck hun.  xoxo|`|tKXVL6h1aa	definitely not worth it!<br>  you said fiance?? as in, you are planning to spend a lifetime like this? and knowing that a guy only gets worse behaving after he gets married?<br>  it may be the hardest thing you ever do, but break up with him! if its only good 90% of the time, then you must be miserable the other 10%. just realize that youre better than that and you dont need to be listening to him...about the abortion and stuff...and you shouldnt marry him. move on :) please do it. please.|`|BAlntsndaa	You are afraid to be alone, aren't you? Because otherwise why are you staying with a guy who makes you feel worse and pushes you to do things you don't feel right about. All the answers are there, you are just having a hard time dumping a guy you know deep down is wrong for you. You are a nice gal who saw some good in a guy who just isn't good enough, ok?|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	He isn't worth it.<br>  <br>  You haven't been together for that long and are now seeing his true character. If he is this hateful this early in the relationship it will only get worse. you don't want it to turn into 90% of the time him acting badly towards you do you? Get out why you can.|`|q5Ne340Vaa	He isnt. they usually don't change. Ive been married for 10 years to a verbal, physical and emotional abuser. He is always charming when he needs to be.....but has a very short fuse. And they way he treats me he is now treating the children )(ie yelling etc) RUUUUNNNN you will not regret it.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	im sure 90 % of the time chris brown was wonderful to rhianna but you saw what that other 10 percent did.<br>  <br>  to be honest, that 10 percent will continue to grow.  I wouldn't get married until you resolve these problems|`|3gljWitCaa	if you have to ask<br>  then no hes not worth it<br>  sorry<br>  <br>  i didnt even have to read that to tell you [i did tho btw, still not worth it]<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|vCZuh3oDaa	No, he is not worth it.<br>  <br>  Any man that urges you to have an abortion against your will is not worth it.  Same goes for men who shout/yell at their S.O.'s.|`|gpJOSJw0aa	AWE sweetheart, you need to get out of that relationship and quick. Your fiance isn't worth ANY of your time and you deserve better than that lunatic. Any man who told you getting an abortion was the right thing isn't worth it. He isn't a man he's just body that happens to have a penis attached to it. You need a man that will treat you with some respect, and honor you for who you are and won't call you deplorable names. You need to act quick, if he is acting like this with you right now and he's only your fiance. Imagine when you two are married? It will only get worst. He is showing you the very early signs of domestic violence by calling you names (verbal abuse). He is an a$$hole you're a strong woman! You need to stand up for yourself. If not for yourself think about the people that you love. Do it for them. Brush that dude off your shoulder, tighten out your skirt and say you're not taking this crap anymore tell him to find himself a barbie doll because it's obvious he wants the perfect wife. Cheers hun be safe and don't let that dude run you because you're a STRONG woman <3|`|yzrvnDusaa	I say DUMP HIM! He made you get the abortion by making you think it was the right thing to do, but now you regret it, and thats Not your fault. Its his! Dont blame yourself for his wrong doing, & if he's only 90% then dump him he should be 110%! you deserve way better Girl! and You know that deel in your heart, its the Right AND Best thing to do! Hes not Your Mr. Right from what I hear, Youll find him, hun, just Not in this guy! =] and im sorry about your abortion, but when you find the One, you can have many children! =]|`|iDfRTLklaa	From everything you have written, I would say hell no!  I think its time you really looked at what you wanted from a relationship, and if you can be honest with your self, I think you already know that this is not the man for you.  You deserve better.|`|YxAh57jiaa	i dont think he's worth it - im sorry but its my honest opinion <br>  there is a guy out there that is 100% great and will treat you with respect and not be jealous that you have friends <br>  <br>  i hope you find what your looking for <br>  xx|`|EJMwqU3caa	Have you tried pre-marital counseling?  It may seem extreme, but in the long run, a divorce is much more extreme (not too mention expensive!)|`|e2bc9d6d80cd30940315e03dcd764fd3aa	I know it's hard hearing this, but you are in an unhealthy relationship and you need to get out of it to protect yourself.|`|9PaRdlwcaa	Not worth a minute of your time. You don't want to be stuck with someone like that. You should be able to let your gaurd down with the person you're going to marry, and you should be able to talk about whats on your mind and make decisions together. You need to get out of this relationship before it's too late. I'm terribly sorry about the abortion. I am against it, but i understand. Try talking to family/friends that could lift your spirits some. Again, you deserve much better.

Many guys like to play hard to get and he may just be one of them.  You are very beautiful and i definitely dont see how his friends would make comments about you in a negative way.  If anything they may have been saying the complete opposite and telling him to go for it.  But you should be careful when dealing with someone who has a girlfriend, because some guys can play into your life and take advantage.  Try to find out by asking some friends to talk to his friends or even him.   Good Luck!!

AA10478339	Tough one... If you don't mind I will add my two cents.<br>  <br>  Well I can honestly thought the same thing...  About life, we are going to die anyway why make such relationships...  Here is my thing.  We are human, I believe apart of humanity we are driven to be around each other, to not live in isolation but to be with one another.  Rather it be a relationship of friendship, kinship, or just love.  No matter the reason we are driven towards each other.  Even though I guilty all the way of this, but ipods, text messaging etc... get in our way of true relationships.  Relationships that really matter to each other.  Everyone has different story.  <br>  <br>  I had a dream...  I have always thought of the experiences as the meaning of my life.  I have always dared to do crazy or just different things to fulfill my need for meaning.  I would think to myself at the top of mountain, not many people will do this in their life time.  I then since changed since that which in my dream said...  Is life about your experiences, or the person you become because of those experiences.  That was a year ago.  <br>  <br>  I currently do not have a girlfriend because i am finding my internal happiness first, after that I know I will be willing to make that trip with someone else.  I don't want to spend my life alone or even go through those experiences by myself any longer, I want someone there for most of the way through life.  <br>  <br>  The meaning of life is different for every person, I think you have a lot on your hands.  Please don't take this the wrong way but maybe talking to professional to assist you get these thoughts out.  To guide and help you.  You said that you just can't get there by yourself to that moment of happiness, well maybe you need some guidence.  I don't think you are insane or anything like that but you just need a little push to get there.

What you wrote is perfect, so what is wrong with it? Even just the short list u put up is awesome.
O0UAy7Moaa	if you're looking for commitment, like a relationship, i would say forget about this guy.
AA10065812	???????<br>  MEN???????????<br>  <br>  Have you even read the newspapers in the last few years?  Numerous studies have shown far more women, entering their 30s and 40s, are choosing not to be married, AND/OR have kids, than men, whose overall numbers are shrinking.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	you will take half and then make me pay support|`|WhlwZeiXaa	cause im only 20|`|c3f0288f0795ae4a646f8c1bb917d015aa	Just spend some time reading the questions and responses in this section alone!<br>  Reading this stuff is enough to make most men swear off marriage for life!|`|iblT1HJpaa	WOW! <br>  A Pandora's Box just flew open!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  (guys don't get married because women do not demand it before sex. Wise up!)|`|iZDsMCghaa	They don't?<br>  The stores around here are full of nags hounding men, they must be married. You dont think they'd put up with it from someone they werent tied down to, do you?|`|waIPnxwJaa	NEVER GET MARRIED><br>  I swear to myself that I will never get married and that I would rather die.|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	Divorce is expensive.|`|a8HFTnCKaa	Because the women get all of the benefits if divorce occurs.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Depends on who is asking....|`|88bDvyiwaa	Coz we are smart.|`|tt08Ve96aa	they do........|`|a7f3d8bf66bfd9fc1daac1814d6e6577aa	because the wife always cheat.|`|hMSVmJN5aa	cause i dont want to deal with a hoe naggin my *** about stuff 24/7|`|8I9laA15aa	I think people don't want to get married anymore because morals hardly exsist anymore. Commitment, trust, honesty, the thought of being with one person scares them(don't know why the way things are this time and day). But don't give up there are some guys out there that still want to get married.|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	as a single man with no plans of getting married any time soon at all.<br>  I could tell you that I don't want responsibility and commitment and stuff, but no, I know that my instinct kicks in at some point that I would want to have a family, to replicate and have security and stability in my life, the Real issue and reason is that<br>  it is all about Money! Money! Money!<br>  <br>  you know how hard it is to get by living a single life? now combine that with wanting to live a good family life, in which I can be happy financially"as I am doing now" but along with a wife and kids! it just gets too hard. don't the wife deserve a good life? don't the kids deserve to support a good life for them? and do you know how expensive it is now days to give a normal good life to your kids.<br>  <br>  I know many ppl are doing it, and I may sound too negative, but I honestly see it as a major problem.|`|ne9eRGwVaa	"A very sad thing happened to me. Even now it still makes me sad. Something very very sad. I lost something important and the sadness still remains. But I'm searching. Someone who likes me for who I am. Someone that belongs only with me. I finally found her. But it was the beginningof more pain. The pain of being with her but not being able to do anything for her. The pain of seeing her in pain. So I chose to disappear because I like her but even so not seeing her beings me more pain. I left her because we loved eachother. We seperated because of love. Because it's her happiness."|`|512dd30dd4fa35da6b4c826537a039ccaa	They do but probably the reason less get married is because their usually is no benefit to men to get married plus most women today are not obedient to their husbands.|`|VBJOR4YRaa	Cause the trust factor. Affairs make it hard for a guy to trust again. You are w/someone for 20 years and never think such a thing can happen to you and then BAM it hits you like a ton of bricks but time heals all wounds so they say.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Well Divorce is expensive, marriage is too.  It is not the commitment part cause guys can be committed to one thing or many things.  Some just don't believe in it or what.  It is really his preference.|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	Because even if she fools around behind your back she gets your ASSets. The courts are in favor of women and clean guys out so why would any fool want to get married and risk usually this assets and limited visits to children.|`|om3N441xaa	When you have to deal with the Feminists type who have BIGGER BALLS than a rodeo bull, who really wants to be married to such a person.???  Look at Hillary Clinton, she keeps Bill's in a lock-box.<br>  No lock-box for this guy.....|`|oJhr79cgaa	I dunno. I guess i got luck and found a great mad that cooks and cleans and works and changes diapers and we are married. lol. and he's sweet and affectionate too!|`|vDdedQ2eaa	I wanna get marry to my one true love one when I have in my future. Who ever she is. I'm 18  BTW. Also you can't really trust women now thes days.|`|wseP86qSaa	They don't? Maybe because young women are just moving in with their boyfriends too young and prematurely? Why buy the cow when the milk is free?|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Tired of having all of our belongings taken in 3 years, end up in a motel room with no money.|`|wJQbYRNiaa	because there are not many good women out there anymore|`|Ch5hniY2aa	Well they do don't they! But yeah Divorce is expensive.<br>  <br>  - Jared Graziano|`|W1GHZW3Caa	we get distinguished you get fat and wrinkly|`|axylPYftaa	i dont love no bitches, i'm waiting for the right girl
BPp9SvPaaa	i think the girl should definatley tell someone...she shouldnt go out and yell it out loud..she should tell her cousin first....but if it was her fault...in anyway.....then i dont think she shouldd tell anyone....i wish her the best of luck|`|AA12006899	yes tell someone immediatley then send her to counsiling u probably will break her heart but its better than whats coming
88bDvyiwaa	Get her some Big Reds before she holds the baby|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	for pete's sake its the child's grandmother!<br>  <br>  if she had cancer would you be scared for her to hold her baby? <br>  <br>  dont be so overprotective. that child needs to know family love. not just yours. and for goodness sake dont talk bad about your mother in law to your child. kids mimick and you will create a mess if your child mimick your words...|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Grow up! You have decided to marry this man and have his children. This is your child's grandmother. I can understand completely your husbands frustration; he is probably wondering how in the heck he ever thought it was a good idea to marry someone so shallow and selfish. I feel so sorry for this child you have brought into this world. Wow!|`|0PdYYeBFaa	Oh please...you have to be kidding. That is your mother in law and your husband has a right too...allow him to show the proud blessing  you both have produced to your mother in law.<br>  <br>  You are going to have adjust to that breath..she's family (lol).|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Are you suffering from some sort of anxiety problem? If not, then hand over the grand baby and take a nap. If so then get counseling and hand over the grand baby.|`|ckr2be5daa	Baby won't care..  Maybe serve a meal with parsley when you have her over (or another food that helps in this area)?|`|vykh2ykLaa	LMAO!!! Thats so funny. Okay but really, let the woman hold her grandbaby.|`|oJhr79cgaa	well yes i think it's incosiderate and rude.|`|AA11283117	It's normal to be protective of your newborn but your in-law's breath won't sicken your child.  Be a good mother, wife, and daughter in law and let grandma dote. Do make her wash her hands (and everyone else, including you and hubby), at least for the first few months until your child's immune system strengthens.|`|jpimg8doaa	You are one crazy MOM!!  give me a break!  Let that woman hold her grandbaby.  I bet you accepted the gifts that she bought and didn't think twice about her breath.  I bet yours doesn't always smell fantastic either.  I am laughing so hard on this one.  Are you really serious or just trying to see how many people will answer?  <br>  <br>  Tic Tac, Gum, Lifesaver, mints, keep them nearby for you both!!!!|`|wseP86qSaa	Just offer her the baby and a tic tac.|`|ASq7LSggaa	your ridiculous|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Your baby will not notice or be affected the mother in law's bad breath.  Bad breath is not harmful nor contagious.   You must remember that most people cannot smell their own bad breath so she may not know she has bad breath, unless someone tells her.  Also, most bad breath is caused by bacteria that live on the top of the tongue and produce those bad smells.  Sometimes you can see this bacteria as white stuff on the top of the tongue.  If her breath really bothers you then I suggest you log on to <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a> and buy her an OraBrush tongue cleaner and give it to her as a present, along with a note for her to use it.  She will get the message and you will notice a greatly improved time with your mother in law.  That is better to do than to not let her hold her grandchild.|`|kbz5S3waaa	you cant be serious...|`|bljEhh86aa	WOW!! so when you baby get older your mother in law can tell her she never was allowed to hold the baby. Your baby going to ask why she wasn't allowed. "your answer would be cause her breath wasn't as fresh as mommies". So therefore you never got picked up from your dying grandmother. WOW how would you feel if the shoes was on the other foot. If and when you become a grandmother and your grandkids would do that to you.  I see "your" idiotic point. <br>  <br>  computers  should be banned in certain states.<br>  <br>  never mind what I wrote your name says it all.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	If your mother-in-law's breath smells bad then you need to offer her a piece of gum. She probably doesn't realize that her breath smells bad. Having bad breath will not make anyone sick. Your mother-in-law probably needs to go to the dentist to have her teeth cleaned. You have no reason to be paranoid and your baby will not care.|`|aXYiOskmaa	oh geez. the baby won't mind. let her hold her grandchild|`|IvMPh09baa	haha.... oh man... hahah!<br>  <br>  buy her some binaca as a gift.

But I decided that because I love my husband and he loves me. That he would have to deal with her and let her know what would be acceptable and what wouldn't when it came to the way she talked and treated me.|`|b8f0567cc965cfac3a2b7aa6564ba025aa	My mother in law loved me very much but tried to hard to be 'helpful'  that caused me a lot of grief with her good  intentions.I still love the old Hussy though!|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	These are all things that you need to discuss with your boyfriend before you decide to get married; crazy mother or not. You need to discuss with him what will be the limits set for his mother re: children and interference. The two of you must be on the same page and he needs to be strong enough to remind her in a loving way; the two of you will be the parents. She is the grandparent. Bottom line. If the two of you can come to some type of workable agreement; her attitude and differences will not and should not matter in the least. Good luck.|`|xVMtfuWPaa	no, not really as long as you have boundaries. don't let her meddle in you and your hubby's buisiness too much. how is she meddling in your relationship ? don't let do that by creating boundaries. is your bf a mama's boy ? be careful that he doesn't complain about you to her all the time.|`|veZLfnGFaa	No, it isn't as long as you get everything understood with your bf.|`|TKf6z1vHaa	A relationship with your future spouse's family in the ideal world would be perfect. But lets face it, you were probably raised diff. that the person you are going to marry. So naturally it takes some adapting to their family. No, I don't think it is a reason to not get married. Your marrying her son, and not the mother so your relationship with her is irrelevant. Sure, it would be great if you got along, but its not the end of the world.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Talk about it, calmly, with your boyfriend. If you try your best and the MIL does not meet you half way then don't worry about it. Don't allow her to meddle in your business. When she tries then just shut her down (not physically).<br>  <br>  If you have a passive personality then I would say it won't work, and if you are overly aggressive it will be war all the time--so if you are the kind that stands up for yourself without feeling the need to knock her block off--then yeah you will be fine.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	well, i think your future husband can kill this entire mess. he can stand up to his mother, in respect, and defend you when she verbally attacks you. if he wont or dont, then sad to say, it will be a constant battle until you two can work it out..if any communication exists between you two. <br>  <br>  you wouldnt be marrying the mother, but the son. but only if HE defines that fact to her and demands her respect towards you two as a couple.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	no it's not.<br>  <br>  unless you plan to live with her, which would be insane. <br>  <br>  letting others control our emotions is unhealthy.  we all have our differences and is your future mother in law is overbearing, well set some personal boundaries!  don't let her get under your skin.<br>  <br>  if you can't handle it, then move on i suppose... but i've never let anyone else ruin my life because they disagreed with me.  and i've never let anyone else run my life either.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	There is nothing wrong with her offering you her suggestions.  You do not have to abide by them.  Don't sweat the small stuff and your life will be much more pleasant.<br>  I am so happy my children have grandparents in their lives.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	A crazy mother -in-law is reason enough to do a lot of things...|`|AA11097184	No. You must trust your loved one. If your boyfriend is totally controlled by his mother, then you must consider the fact seriously. Talk with him and find out his views.|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	Absolutely!!!  Sounds like he may be a bit of a mama's boy and don't think for one second that any of that will change after marriage.  If his mother is already behaving like this now, I gaurantee it will get worse.  And what really stings is that your husband will most likely take his mom's side most of the time.  Trust me, been there done that!   We also had very different background and religous beliefs.<br>  While we were dating I kept thinking in the back of my mind how great it is that he is so attentive to his mother and treats her so well but guess what.....not so enduring after you get married.  I told my ex prior to the divorce that we should go to counseling and at first he rejected it. But then shortly thereafter, he said he wanted to give it a try and I asked him if he could finally make me and his 18 month old daughter the priority in his life and his parents and siblings would have to be the ones to take a back seat and be secondary for a change.  His response was that his parents and siblings will ALWAYS come first!  That's when I said, see ya!|`|Bqc86DRQaa	It depends on how your boyfriend sees things. If he agrees with you and is willing to tell mommy in law that she has her beliefs and you and he have yours then it may not be too big of a deal. If he sides with her more often you may have a lot of disagreements in your future.
dFHsAXDMaa	the only thing you can do is be yourself and not go around trying to impress people by being something you are not... people see right through that and that is what is annoying.. someone who changes who they are when they are talking in diferent groups of people.. just be real just be you..Part of life some people will like you some people won't screw the ones who don't...impossible to be everything everyone what you to be why you can only be you.. and they either like you for you or not..|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	how about you learn to love yourself and not give a crap what others say or think about you. it's your life, live it up!|`|XqHPQIOtaa	Rae you cocky, are u loud, do u say stupid stuff, with kids now adays things that u think is normal can be really annoying to some ppl so ask someone wats ur prob with me<br>  An if your a gal wtf is up with ur avatar?|`|BuJClF3Faa	There is always one reason or another people don't like you. Try to find out. Maybe you ARE mean, and you don't know it. A lot of people are mean without knowing or intentionally doing it. Try talking to people, watch what you say.<br>  <br>  Why should you care what they think, anyway? You don't need to care so much about what others think about you. Care what you think.|`|Lh6pnwqHaa	talk to them and try to find out<br>  btw if youre a girl its a good idea to change your avatar|`|mIh685iBaa	buy some books on itunes! there good|`|efTvaFFFaa	be yourself, people always respect other people who aren't afraid to show who they are. Also, just be nice and considerate; it is VERY difficult to dislike someone who is kind. Be charming and outgoing and just smile at random people (in a nice way though, not a suspicious way lol)|`|S9nthF7vaa	lol! but you have a boy icon...<br>  hummm, well i think you should talk to people and make jokes and act chill, people shouldn't hate you if you are nice and everything/<br>  <br>  if that doesn't work then it's there loss.|`|JjS4ARPYaa	See what kind of reputation other people would say you have.|`|KBFOaEMJaa	did you try find out why they don't like you?|`|Q7XwBNMEaa	ur annoying maybe. But you could try making friends yourself
zbSBwhDhaa	It means you're protective of her, want nothing bad to EVER happen to her, and really treat her special. Read the books, you'll see what she's talking about. Hope this helps. :] <br>  <br>  Bay <3|`|LFzS2Qi5aa	He is very protective of bella and super sweet! He also goes out of his way to help her and be around her. If you remind her of him then you are totally good to go! I would recommend reading the book or seeing the movie because it is great and if you continue to act like edward this girl will probably like you for a very long time and she is very lucky!
9d312c80f895f20c08272dd2fd60c61aaa	just tell him yourself.<br>  <br>  it's more direct, no foggy details because the message has been passed down by different people.|`|98cJg2pCaa	Dont do it on your birthday, he might hurt you :(|`|1Lo34oEDaa	dude tell himself. it seems like you are forcing him to like you and ask you out|`|YsdcIqX9aa	Wow, def not!<br>  <br>  Tell him yourself, its always better. He would respect you alot more.<br>  & Your turning 16, having your friend tell them is pretty elementary.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|hYP6akCYaa	hell no dont chicken out, he think that ur not corageous and strong if u chicken out plus wats the worst that cud happen. . .he's says no and wants to b just friends<br>  <br>  go 4 it|`|uqlAx5mJaa	Please, don't do that!<br>  A guy will most of the time never believe that you like him until he hears it from you, in person. That way there's no unclear details, and he knows the truth. <br>  <br>  You really need to tell him yourself. And, on your birthday might be a bad idea. You said you all don't talk that much, and if he happens to say no, do you really want that memory for you're sweet 16th? I would just have fun tomorrow, and not worry too much about asking him out until after wards. You could flirt a little though, and see how he responds. Ask him for a hug, and get to know him a little more.<br>  <br>  But you definately should ask him yourself, in person.|`|vU3IMRIIaa	If you have someone else do your bidding for you, you will regret it for the rest of your life. You should go to him and talk to him yourself. He will like that much better, shy or not, he will know it is truthful. It is more embarrassing for a guy to have someones friend tell them someone likes him....don't do it sweetie....very bad idea|`|HReDTDExaa	happy sixteenth!! its such an awesome feeling!!! but you should defintely tell him yourself ma. you're sixteen now growin up tha muture thing to do is tell him yourself.|`|TAzSoM7vaa	Tell him yourself.<br>  Goodluck!|`|sGRIDtdbaa	the best way is for you to do it yourself|`|82b9e4215671dcd9c72b4acb956563d2aa	Don't have your friend tell him guys like it when a girl is courageous and confident tell him yourself!!  You can start off by saying hey do u have a girlfriend? and if he says no you can be like oh well lucky for me cause i think we would look cute together or something like that lol|`|CSBvtkmlaa	You should ask him. Having friends do it always complicates things. Just get up the nerve make some small talk then pop in and ask would you like to come to my birthday party. Make it a question where he can say yes or no so it isn't so demanding. If he says yes then good luck on asking him out on a date later on. If he says no then it's no big deal you'll just have to move on and ask someone else.|`|TFB7zFFZaa	Getting your friend to break the ice is okay, but will she be the one talking the whole relationship? You will have to open up a little yourself if you want him to as well. Have you tried your flirting skills to get his attention yet? If you have and he hasn't warmed up then maybe he is not really interested. If you haven't, try flirting a little. If you are having a party or you and your friends are going out invite him to come along. Your Sweet 16 is special so take care of what you are asking for on that day. You would hate to get bad news when you should truly be happy. Good Luck!!!!!
IqqaA2wIaa	lol<br>  wheres the coffee??
FcettwI8aa	whoa whoa. noticed how u said that. he seems nice BUT really quiet. that could affend someone, and give them the wrong impression. think about it, he might've thought they u didnt think much of him. thats my opinion, but nothing against you. : )|`|imKCvvFKaa	he probably likes you, and he dislikes what you think of him. but yeah, that's a bit dramatic|`|xPeIvywdaa	lmao i just read the whole thing<br>  <br>  sounds like he has a problem with people calling him quiet, he just needs to know, its fine being quiet, personally i like quiet peeps the best<br>  <br>  maybe he felt like you were trying to insult him, and sounds like he got problems probably cause he waas made fun of in the past<br>  <br>  o well just keep doin your thing, if you wana talk to him about it do it, or just ignore him|`|dx9msaNzaa	it sounds slightly creepy but he could just be shy.<br>  <br>  Go with your gut on this one. If you feel the need talk to someone you trust about this...they know more about the situation|`|W1GHZW3Caa	wait so you are a senior in a junior class?|`|9AuiEEb8aa	of course he's being dramatic... oh well that's his problem not yours.|`|vU3IMRIIaa	Maybe he likes you and was too shy to say anything. If you never talked to him then he might have thought you weren't into him. I would talk to him and tell him that you didn't mean it in a bad way, and that you would like to start over. Maybe it will start something, even if it is just a great friendship. :-)|`|Z6sCMskNaa	Just say sorry and that there must be some misunderstanding. If you are shy, chatting online is easier. Just say you are shy too and start aq conversation. Thats the only way :)|`|OU8n1EPSaa	he sounds like a btch.<br>  i'm all the btch i need in a relationship.<br>  <br>  but maybe you should just let him know that you did not mean to offend him, and that you didn't at all mean it as a bad thing.|`|pj0K2U0faa	LMFAO to a senior in a junior class(:<br>  <br>  maybe he is anti social or sensitive.|`|oT6er7BOaa	Whoa! That means he likes you! Lots! <br>  and he isnt being dramatic! Whenn people like other people they tend to dislike it when their own crushes say ANYTHING about them. and if hes liek really cute, ask him out.|`|qQV2AKHSaa	Maybe he doesn't like your impression of him.<br>  It seems like he likes you though. Try to keep a convo. going between the both of you.|`|V5tFbQpiaa	sounds like he is shy, lacks self esteem, and has low confidence in general.  If your looking for him to make the first move don't expect him to.  Perhaps if you approach him and start a conversation he will open up a bit.  I'd suggest you talk with him in private because he will likely get embarrassed and show you his jerk side (like he has been doing).<br>  <br>  Also, don't expect him to be a good conversationalist but rather to do most of the listening at first.|`|rwBh07Ncaa	I was very quiet in High School. Lots of girls liked me (I found this out after I graduated) but thought I was conceited. Some guys just need you to make the first move in terms of talking. This guy probably just doesn't have the confidence to come up ant talk to you. He obviously likes you by his body language. Try just saying hi to him on a regular basis. Then ask him about himself. That should do the trick. Don't read anything into his silence. Then. later, when you guys know each other better, you can tell him that you didn't mean anything bad by calling him quiet.|`|FYtd3PB6aa	He's probably just a sensitive person. And don't talk to him for a while, and if he doesn't talk to you, talk to him. What's there to be afraid of?|`|sGRIDtdbaa	just say something to him communication is the key|`|5kkJ9J3faa	Mmmm, he sounds really weird and of the problem type guy...I seriously think he's not worth your time|`|0JjHacT6aa	I'd say that's being a tad dramatic...or more than just a tad.<br>  but then again, hes shy. when he put up that he was so mad its probably because people have told him that before and he wants people to just talk to him.<br>  Some people are really hard to talk to and you have to encourage them to open up, and that may take awhile but they always have something to say.<br>  That and if he looks at you a lot im guessing he likes you.<br>  boys are strange, and they will be forever so dont count on that changing but you should talk to him. he'll probably think its weird but that going to be because you never have.<br>  and apparently he hasn't given up yet.<br>  take him seriously if he thinks no one does, and be serious with him, dont call him shy or anything either.<br>  <br>  it'll be ok.<br>  trust me.|`|cd21e2add7f6da1cbc78736fa13952b2aa	If you dont dare talk to him face to face..Since you got his im chat with him through there..What can it hurt explaining what happen the worst he can do is sign off which i bet he wont even if he doesnt respond just write what happen and what he got wrong..Give him a apology even though you don't think you should after you do maybe he actually pay more attention and ya can actually maybe be friends and even make a few jokes and say it nothing wrong being for the heck i quiet myself just do what you feel it right just make sure it the right way before you do it|`|d3xZaoenaa	Hes probably mad, because..he probably liked you and maybe when you said that..it kinda hurt.<br>  ^Thats what i'm thinking.<br>  <br>  If you really think hes mad at YOU..then you need to talk to him.<br>  I.M him.<br>  Ask him if hes mad at you, tell him your sorry for what you did. <br>  Or..<br>  Just be friendly and nice to him at school. Don't let him just stare at you and not say anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  p.s is he cute? just wondering...

QdQcAHqaaa	Yes. Parents like to come across things from when their kids were alive.  It is even more special when those things come from other people, because it lets them know that their child is remembered by many.  I think since it has been a year, it is appropriate.|`|1KfbgBupaa	If you truly wrote the note with the intention of sending it to their son before his death, I think they'd love to have it.  Mail it to them, along with a letter to explain the situation.  It may make them sad but I think it will also make them happy.|`|BAlntsndaa	NO, keep it for yourself as a reminder. It may only create some uncomfortable memories for the parents even if it has been a year. If you want, call or drop them a note saying you were thinking of this kid and what a great tutor they were and just wanted to see how the parents are doing. They would appreciate someone remembering their child, but keep the note for yourself.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	No.  There is no need.  It may bring to the surface the sad emotions they just put to rest.  I'm sure that his family does not need a reminder that he was a good person-- they already know that.<br>  <br>  Just read over your note, think of his kindness, and (to the extent you believe) say a little prayer for him and the family.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	I think if they are normal people they would really appreciate it and it's thoughtful of you to consider it.|`|eTryaDOWaa	i dont exactly know.  If they are not greiving about their son anymore (like, not crying all the time) then give it too them.  But, if they are, dont.  They arnt ready.|`|8838a1367bf15736946a9ce17cee7b59aa	Give it to the parents. I truly believe that the parents have reminders of their son and a lovely reminder would be good. I say follow your heart. If you feel that you need to give this to them then do it.|`|8Njdzwi0aa	Yes, defiantly give it to them. It will give them joy knowing their child was appreciated. You can mail it to them explaining how you just found it.|`|dHPA390Qaa	not<br>  <br>  If you feel moved to do something to acknowlege his kindness, then you should just let his parents know how much you appreciated him and his selfless giving.|`|9PaRdlwcaa	Give it to them. It would remind them that their son was a good person, and they might appreciate a visit from one of his friends.
9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	to be honest, it's probably most difficult if you are extremely attractive or not very attractive.  If you can honestly say that you are somewhere in the middle, then guys should be ok with being friends with you without worrying about you having feelings for them or them having feelings for you.  Otherwise, though, it is tough, because those are always possibilities.  I've been fortunate enough to have many good female friends, but I've been romantically interested in nearly every one of them at some point.  also fortunately, most of them have ended up being romantically interested in me as well, so it worked out, but when there are singular romantic feelings in a friendship it's basically a ticking time bomb.<br>  <br>  All that being said, then, my best advice is to be as aware as possible of romantic inclinations of you guy friends, and only try to develop friendships with the ones for which you know there are no strong feelings either way or mutual feelings.  good luck!<br>  <br>  if you get a chance, take a look at my question: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av4E2bRZjDyzTxyqWvP1qXbty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307170204AACzK40">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|oOU6XJOqaa	First, observe how the guy you want to be friends with acts around his friends. Also take note who he hangs out with and try to imitate their style. Do not act like a Lesbo, but more as a companion. Try to be nice and cool, do not come on to the guy as if you wanted a relationship. That may inflict pressure.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|A9cH8CL9aa	be one of the guys lol...<br>  <br>  dont bring in drama|`|dFHsAXDMaa	the only thing you can do is be yourself and not go around trying to impress people by being something you are not... people see right through that and that is what is annoying.. someone who changes who they are when they are talking in different groups of people.. just be real just be you..Part of life some people will like you some people won't screw the ones who don't...impossible to be everything everyone what you to be why you can only be you.. and they either like you for you or not..

gq9Xk8R0aa	I only see my boyfriend once every week or two, but we talk on the phone everyday...|`|ls8KNu9uaa	When it comes to relationship, everyone has different preferences. And we should respect them for that, and they should respect you too for your choices.<br>  <br>  If talking or seeing someone once or twice a week, that is totally up to you. If that is how you show your love. But you also have to consider the feelings of your partner. Would that have been enough for them?<br>  <br>  The tip here, is that in relationships, you guys have to talk things out.

Z6sCMskNaa	Just support her as a friend if she is upset about the breakup. Breaking up takes time to get over, give her some space and time to heal. If you show how loyal and loving you are as a friend, she will be more interested in you. Try asking in 2 months.|`|9syEUfnqaa	okay..well first you need to get that girl you would die for into a conversation. she just got out of a relationship so she might not want to start anything soon. Just be her friend and build a strong bond between you two and if you guys get as close as you like, then give out subtle hints that your into her and that you would be there for her anytime.|`|HReDTDExaa	ask yourself who you have more passionate feelings for and who could you see yourself just being with for a decent amount of time and which one can you be yourself around to? and if the one you knew longer doesn't like you, then just tell her ya'll can be friends and maybe see how it goes with the other girl|`|jpimg8doaa	first of all slow down and chill.  You are way to excited over this.  This is one of those things that you should definitely not make a hasty decision.  Stop and think.  Date them both?|`|ndvPVfa0aa	Did the girl that just broke up with her boyfriend get dumped by her boyfriend?  If so, make her feel that her happieness is all that matters to you. You might tell her that he really made a mistake on dumping someone so wonderful.  Tell her that if her ex doesn't come back begging to date her again than you would love to take her on a date. If you go, make it some where special, it doesn't have to be expensive.|`|RO5fRyIvaa	I like the first answer, except for the ask in two months. You can't put a time limit on healing, for some people it's quick, others it's not. Just be there for her, show her you care, even if it's just through your friendship. This isn't a guarantee you'll get the girl like in those flipping movies, but it's worth a try, don't you think? Also, stick with her if you're seriously interested in just her. It's not good to add conflicting interests to already conflicting thoughts.|`|sGRIDtdbaa	first don't be the rebound guy because you will be the one to get hurt in the end, and you need to figure out which one you really want to be with instead of just having all these crushes on people it makes no sense at all, you will never know until you say something instead just wondering, and try writing a note Do you like me yes no maybe!!!|`|vU3IMRIIaa	If you like this girl , I would console her about breaking up with her bf. Strike up a friendship. Then you can tell her how you feel and see where it goes....but I would avoid telling her that you would die for her....hmmm|`|CSBvtkmlaa	First thing you have to do is decide which one you like more. Then ask her out. You'll never  know if you do ask.|`|uttbqGB9aa	No one can force feelings on another person. Chemistry and nature are what decide who falls for us and who does not. We do, however, also have a role in this but a small and humble one.<br>  <br>  You can talk to her and be there for her but do not rush her or pressure her. <br>  <br>  Let her fall for you on her own when her heart is ready too.<br>  <br>  Life is too short and too complicated with many more severe problems to worry about, but if your young, don't compromise your best years for a trivial pursuit. Life does not wait for anyone or anything. <br>  <br>  Just enjoy your life, do what you want to do, and let life take its course. Sometimes we win and sometimes we lose.<br>  <br>  If you are a good person, im sure she will find that out on her own, and if not, someone surely will in time.<br>  <br>  Go log off and enjoy your life, call up some friends, and have a good time for yourself and no one else.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie.|`|9AuiEEb8aa	i really don't know how to help you but do me a favor and don't do anything stupid like killing yourself.

Q5BM2POnaa	You parents decide to move to another country and didn't tell you directly?  Sorry, but that seems weird that you'd have to hear about it from someone else.<br>  <br>  I also think that you entered into a commitment to marry this guy.  That shouldn't be taken lightly.  You knew about his record and the restrictions it places and you still chose to marry him. I would hope that you also had at least heard you parents talk about possibly moving to another country as that's not a decision most people take lightly or make quickly.  If so, you also knew that was a possibility.<br>  <br>  I doubt if your fiancee's record prevents him from visiting other countries, and you are deciding to make a future with him; not your parents.<br>  <br>  If you would break off your engagement over this you probably aren't ready to get married in the first place.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	When you get married, you leave your parents house, and your husband becomes your immediate family and the number one person in your life.

It would be interesting to ask them why they're so upset about it.|`|0uD5weHLaa	There is huge difference between one generation and the next. In the 1950's parents nearly killed (and in one or two cases, actually did kill) their kids for wearing skirts that showed the knees. ffs! so don't worry, what you've just been through is just the history of the future, like the 50's is to now. Its just the natural change of whats right and wrong between parents and kids. If you feel the need to carry on wearing black nail polish, just hide it from them in future. its right always that the younger hide things from the elders, thats how change happens.|`|FDq7fEZMaa	awww, im sorry ):<br>  ok, well first. take the color off. and ask your parents why they reacted that way. <br>  <br>  if they say it's ugly, then say many people at school wear black nail polish even if they aren't emo. i wear black nail polish and i wear bright colors all the time to school..|`|d559eedf1a6404ca818b57c6e03ceeffaa	tell them that their ur nails and it isn't hurting anyone and that ur old enough to make such small decisions on ur own.|`|zbSBwhDhaa	Ummmm...

Tell them you simply thought it looked nice on you, and you are not trying to be "dark, emo, or goth" in anyway. Tell them that you think nothing of stereotypes, and dont appreciate being stereotyped by your own parents.

As you said, you are just a normal girl, not emo or punk, and you scared them half to death. See, they probably have had some sort of frightening experience with someone who is emo/punk, and don't want you to end up that way.<br>  So give them some time to cool off, and when they do, just talk to them calmly, and reason through this problem!<br>  Good Luck!|`|uSPEed3Raa	i where black nail polish too....im not emoo either i wouldnt really put me in a group just a normal girl who likes everything. my parents dont care but i guess talk to ur parents about it maybe if you feel like they are gonna freak out on you again go to a restraunt or something like that that way you kno they wont yell at you in a public place like that|`|znZxydq5aa	aw love how old r u? that may have something to do with it....or well they are parentz they over react about all thingz concerning everything. =) the best thing to do is take the polish of (i know u probly want to rebel watever) but yea im like a tottal rocker and im 21 and im just like black all the way so they r probly concerned b-cuz by wearing black nailpolish u steeped into a world that you know nothing of so remove the polish to ther likeing and buy ur self a rose....have a nice life love.|`|Z7bHi1Raaa	they should respect what u want to do, or at least listen to what u have to say.<br>  idk what their prob. is but u might wanna try asking why they don't like it|`|hPNgeU2saa	my sister had her nails painted black a while back and our parents didnt like because they tought she was hanging out with emo people and was doing drugs and stuff, so that might be their reason i guess|`|fDrjvny6aa	i think u should definiently stay away from black nail polish girl! if it brings that much trouble just don't wear it any more|`|AA12006899	well take it off and never put it on again its just nail polish its nothing think about it u can were black after u moove out or theres the option of suing ur parents|`|s4RZxn07aa	they are obviously racist|`|6eJMKZXfaa	take off your nail polish.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  your parents are gayyyyyy

Because the girl can just as easily say no. Also, it is not a good idea to have a friend ask someone out for you, a girl would like to see the guy, whether he gets rejected or not. It lets them see if he is confident. But anyways, you won't know for sure. But if she says "no" there are always ways to convince her. Try hanging out with her more and talking to her more, it will let her know you are a like able person. But don't get annoying, if she tells you to stay away, then do so.|`|PY3wu2ELaa	as far as being nervous i have some excellent advice my friend,<br>  <br>  just picture her naked.<br>  <br>  oh wait that would probably make you even more nervous<br>  aw man im sorry i have nothing for you but that sure does suck. good luck!!!|`|xfv6526Gaa	Why don't you just approach her and ask her out!

If the girl you like told her friend to hook you guys up. But unless your friend knows you like the girl and is trying to hook you guys up because of you. If this girl flirts with you. or gives you hugs. or is shy around you also. She probably likes you. And if i were you. Stop being nervous around her and just go for it. Girls LOVE guys who show confidence in themselves|`|ynj2FPAgaa	Yes, it means she likes you.<br>  And about the nervous thing, some girls think it's cute.<br>  But once you get to talk to her more and stuff then you won't have to worry about it so much and you'll be able to be yourself around her :P<br>  Hope this helped you at least a little bit.

What is most important and what will make your life easier? Raising children alone is no walk in the park. Have you considered counseling for the two of you. It seems that the two of you are talking however no one is really hearing what the other is saying. I would personally look for the assistance of a qualified therapists or counselor to try and work through the issues and mediate for the two of you. Good luck!<br>  <br>  If you do feel as though your life is in danger than you need to get out.

And you say he is really trying to work on the relationship but that's a bunch of BS and you know it.  If he is that controlling, then he obviously doesn't see a problem to begin with.  I really worry for you and your children's safety.  This is NOT a healthy relationship by any means and if this is his attitude towards you I have to wonder how much damage he has inflicted upon the children at his point. I don't necessarily mean physically but the emotional abuse can really leave some damaging scars for all of you if you don't find a way out.  The suggestions given prior is something you should seriously consider and get a plan put into place and when the time is right, you need to leave this man.  He has no intentions of hurting himself, however, you are the one who could be in serious danger.  Please try and get some help and get out as soon as possible!  Good Luck!|`|TKf6z1vHaa	First of all, I would suggest some marriage counseling. It would help you both express your feelings more and in a positive manner. Second, the fact that he told you that he would kill you or himself if you divorced him, shows that he is not as independent as you think. It sounds like he is actually quite needy and needs you. Honestly, you just either need to take a vacation alone(w/o the kids, get a babysitter or something) and spice up the romance again. Good luck.|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	I'm still trying to get my head around your saying your husband is "a good man" and that he threatened to kill you if you divorced him...and that you think if you tried to leave within the next year, there's the "possibility of a dangerous situation".<br>  Save yourself and, especially, your children! Get far, far away from this man as soon as possible. Contact your local battered women's shelter, social services, police, whoever can give you immediate protection. Then wait until he goes off to work, pack up the children and leave, with NO forwarding address.|`|jeNxVE3paa	I have dated a couple of women who have threatened to kill themselves if we broke up.  That is so off the chart weird that you better think twice about leaving.  He threatened to kill himself or kill you, that is not the best child rearing environment, you have to see that.  If he has a good job, is he worried about how much it would cost for alimony and child support.  That can get expensive, I should know.  You might at least take a break and see what happens, that death thing is such a sicko stupid thing to do.  Thats just an attempt for attention or trying to blame you for his shortcomings. yuck|`|uUjQBKQaaa	Well, you say he is a good man, but doesnt pay you much attention. Do you pay attention to yourself? Do you take good care of yourself? Are you so wrapped up with taking care of the kids that you don't have time for yourself? Divorce sounds like an easy way out,but i don't personally feel like its always the best choice.I suggest marital counseling. The two of you should take responsibility for the kids equally.You should find some commom interests that you can do together as a family & focus on each others finer qualities, the ones that attracted you two to each other in the first place. I have been married 23 years & theres nothing more sexy than growing old together,having the grown kids come home with the grandkid.Marriage is not easy,but i think its definately worth it in the long run.
eCKNRcIVaa	No you were right, of course he is going to spin it that way now, like you were crazy to think that is what he meant... PLEASE!  You already know what 'Chill" leads to.  Of course he wants a piece.  He is manipulating you trying to make you feel bad for calling him out on what it is he wants.  Don't fall for it|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	But, will you be awake with  him?|`|93r3nCM1aa	Typical. He turns it back on you to save his own butt, so that he doesn't look like an @ss. I bet you when you said "chill" sex was probably a definite possibility in his mind, and the only reason he got defensive was because he knew what his intentions were. <br>  <br>  Why would you be in the wrong for telling him straight up that you aren't going to sleep with him? There's nothing wrong with being completely honest and letting him know that you ONLY want to chill.|`|J5zqZp7Qaa	No one's in the wrong. Maybe calling him and apologizing for the misunderstanding/wording (not for what you told him) would be a good idea. Make it clear that you like him, you spoke on a misunderstanding, and that if sex  should come into play it will only be after you two establish a real relationship.|`|GeNUriFBaa	you're totally right for not wanting to sleep with him. he's probably just making u a cover. just hang out and chill. don't let it go farther than you want it to.|`|lFzXZQQDaa	you're absolutely right. but chill normally does mean, well, chill...|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	you're probably right about the guy and what he wants.  our instincts are usually right on.<br>  <br>  yes, you're probably a "cool girl" and conducting your life in the way you see fit, makes you even cooler! <br>  <br>  take care.|`|IcRhcar1aa	DAMN! Psh he's lying, he really did want some.|`|KygT3Jo9aa	Want Respect Use A Condom<br>  <br>  like that movie <br>  <br>  The Terminator|`|rRn4PceFaa	well if he did just want to hang out now he knows that u arent a girl like that and u wont sleep with him...  now he should respect u even more.|`|d559eedf1a6404ca818b57c6e03ceeffaa	i totally agree with u, most girls who just randomely sleep with random guys have like no self pride. I would do the exact same thing that u did if that helps.|`|GJMKflrNaa	i said something similar to a guy i was just dating and i haven't heard from him since that conversation|`|W1GHZW3Caa	what a C block. C block you know?|`|FgHq93suaa	Since no one really wants to say it I will. I'm sorry but you really did jump the gun. When things get frisky just say no. It's not that hard to say no mid-heat-of-the-moment. And if he actually wanted it that bad he would move on. I do respect you for your decision but you did jump the gun. Just apologize. If it helps you should chill in public where sex is a no go. He can't even suggest it if you are at a restaurant. Chill at a park, or mcdonalds. Good luck!|`|CSBvtkmlaa	You were right to leave when you did. He was just wanting some action. He probably would have never called you back once it happened. I think you have a strong head on your shoulders and are very wise. Trust your instincts. Don't go back to that guy find someone who truly loves you and doesn't want to use you.|`|HTbSiEVqaa	Honey, girls like you can be a challenge to a guy like that. The more you say no, the more they pursue.so keep that in mind. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, keep it there.|`|se3EnpZqaa	I've dated an army guy before and that was all on his mind. you need to make sure that he understands what u want and dont want. i say talk to him and bring a friend to back you up.|`|ZtTtLpWvaa	You are not in the wrong.  Nothing wrong with having standards, at all.  On the slight chance that he didn't have a$$ on his mind (your intuition was probably accurate, though), then he probably thinks that you overreacted.  The thing is, he already knows you aren't a prude given your past activity.  So if it is worth it to you, call him back and tell him you'd like to hang out.  If not, no worries.
yJ3IaT4Gaa	It sounds to me like infatuation. There's no way you can make her feel the same, either she likes you or not, just give it some time.|`|4l2qOy7Paa	well you shouldn't rush things. you should wait a little bit so you know if those feeling weren't just temporary. and ask her or her friends or something. =]|`|lK3TXGBOaa	aaaaaaaaw i think its sooo cute how much you love her i wish i could find a good guy that will love me like that.......  :(<br>   she probly feels the same way for you if she said yes when you asked her out which means shes interested.....<br>  - i think shes lucky :)<br>  <br>  can you please answer mine...<br>  <br>  go to my profile under my questions and its the first one that says  <br>  <br>  " HELP!! need advice......."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it<br>  <br>  thanx :)|`|1Lo34oEDaa	trust yourself and go with your heart. your life cannot be controlled by the intranet. find a way to get to her and prove that you do love her.|`|Geqb39wxaa	aww :) congradulations!!   i would recomend not getting too attached to her, but yay for you!!|`|Ict5JA4eaa	let time tell|`|Li9kuojFaa	yea u in l o v e dude good luck :)|`|vU3IMRIIaa	Really only time can tell how she feels about you. Don't rush these things, they will all work out. My main advice is if you have to ask if your in love, you might want to rethink it. Once you say love you can't take that back, so make sure you are sure about it before you say it. Hope that helps. :-)|`|M9iOiYZtaa	go ahead bro..but remember know how to create the right attraction..<br>  make progress on her but dont move in too fast..<br>  and try not to be too nicey-nicey..that will only get you in the friend zone..<br>  tease her and make her laugh..<br>  <br>  best of luck buddy!|`|qawYlIjkaa	if you love someone there's a reason, you shouldn't have to question love and its path just trust it if it doesn't work out there's a reason to that to, but if you look into her eyes and think your love her wouldn't she being looking into your eyes thinking the same thing.|`|FU4TyghIaa	I guess you ask the question cause you want to tell the somebody, you want to tell the whole world.  Love is like that, you feel so good and you want everyone to know.<br>  <br>  Ain't it sweet?|`|FgHq93suaa	If you are real young be really careful not to scare her away!  Girls usually start to hint at those feelings, and hey if you aren't real young just lean it kiss her and say, "I love you." Go FOR IT!!|`|HReDTDExaa	you might be :)<br>  if she feels the same way then she'll tell you or just be really giggly and passionate|`|0sI33S9Kaa	you are|`|p2HHFTufaa	I'm not so good at love stuff, but I think you are in love ;)|`|HpKKD7xKaa	The best thing to do is wait. Don't rush in and tell her you love her, just relax and see how it flows. Often we fall in love and say we feel different about this person than any other (and it is true, you do) however in a couple of months she could really change some of her aspects and then you've already told her how you feel and it makes things harder to cope with.  I'm not saying that you don't love her because I'm sure you do, and she probably feels the same way. Wait a while and let this relationship go on it's own terms. Goodluck!|`|cd21e2add7f6da1cbc78736fa13952b2aa	So yep it sound like you in love buddy...there's only one way and that's the my way which is the best way..LISTEN....You take her on this picnic okay...Make up jokes and stuff..MAKE SURE YOU MAKE HER LAUGH AND DON'T BRING ALL THE LOVING STUFF YET...okay than you gotta make up a poem short and sweet and she will definitely laugh so laugh with her. Than ya kiss no long long kiss like a little 2 second peck...Unless she wanna go longer but besides that a peck than you smile and gaze into her eyes and say (her name) than I love you...Than say if you wanna take at least a minute to say it back go ahead than automatic after you say that she will say I love you back positive|`|5hBJrlybaa	If you are in love most likely you'll know. It may just be she's different and there is a possibility that it will bloom into love. You'll know if she feels the same way for you as you her by the little things she does and say, by the hints she leaves you. Good luck.|`|4StO2m0iaa	If u really feel different ab this girl and u feel u would do anything for her and u get butterflies and u don't know if ur heart is beating faster or slower when u are with her and u can't say her name without smiling, then yes! ur in love! <br>  make sure u don't go too fast though! Good Luck to tha both of you!!!|`|XwF0krWOaa	theres no way to tell how she feels at this point unless she tells you herself. <br>  <br>  hears how it look at it, if you KNOW you going to marry this person, you love eachother.|`|QtoDx4Vtaa	It's quite possible you might be in love. But be careful, those might just be excessive hormones as well. As for her liking you and doing anything for you, just ask. What's the harm in asking?|`|zTiHCq51aa	I think you are in love dude. But one thing, if you really do love her, why are you asking us?|`|A6LNyBUtaa	Sounds like to me that you are.<br>  =]|`|hPNgeU2saa	it really sounds like you are in love with her|`|sGRIDtdbaa	tellher how you feel AND see what she says you gotta talk to each other
