20090225081212AAVTPAH	Travel;United States;Cleveland	Cleveland suburb w/ low crime, good schools, affordable housing, shopping, chain restaurants, moderate traffic?	I lived in Terre Haute, Indiana for the last 28 years. We moved to Medina, Ohio last August. Medina is not the place for us to settle down. I love the school here, but I need a bigger city.      Me and Hubby are early thirties with 2 children (8 & 6 years old). Hubby works from home as a steel salesman and travels to Akron, Cleveland, Columbus, etc. to meet with clients. I am a elementary teacher.       We need a house that would cost below $150,000. Low tax rates. We need a family friendly neighborhood to seems quiet but is five minutes from the store, the mall, etc. I like newer homes.       Good schools are the top priority!      I would rather see large chain restaurants (Cheesecake factory, California Pizza Kitchen, Ruby Tuesday) than a quaint town square. Nothing wrong with the quaint small town thing but it's just a personal preference.      We have visited...Akron, Fairlawn, Twinsburg, Strongsville(we really like),Hudson(out of our price range). But just to bowl or eat at a restaurant. So I don't know anything about any towns, just that Medina is not for us.      Could someone who knows this area well please help me! I am going in blind. I would hate to buy a house in a town that we do not like! I would appreciate any opinions, tips, or ideas! I would love to hear anything that would help make this decision easier!      Thank you thank you thank you!

20090227121507AAzBd3i	Travel;United States;New York City	Visiting New York alone at 19 - advisable?	I am considering visiting New York next year alone, and I will be 19. I have visited New York once before, a couple of years ago, and while I was traveling with my parents, I did visit Manhattan alone for one day, and providing you keep yourself to yourself there seemed to be no immediate danger in the day time and I wouldn't say there was really any atmosphere of danger or uneasiness, even alone.       However, that was just one day, maybe I got luckily? I am from the UK and considering visiting for a long weekend, perhaps 4 days. Do you feel this is safe to do entirely alone? Obviously, no where is entirely safe, but some places are of course more dangerous than others.      Obviously, I don't look for trouble, and avoid any potential trouble. ie, if some drunken idiot starting insulting me in the street, I'm not one to provoke the situation by shouting back. In that scenario, I would just leave the area swiftly.       Also, I'm not too sure about accommodation. I have considered a hostel, but I'm somewhat concerned that dormitory style accommodation is a little unsafe for someone traveling alone, more of a thing you do if there's a 2 or 3 of you. Do you think hostels would be fine, or would you advice trying to find a reasonably priced single room accommodation?      Thanks for any advice.

All money is taken care of except for lunches and souvineer money. I would like to get as much of that money raised on my own so my parents can give me more souvineer money.       I know that i can ask my relatives, neighbors for work, and possibly get a job, but being 15, its kinda hard for me to get a job someplace. i applied for maggie moos and havent gotten called back but i would totally save if they hired me. I love to help people so if you have any suggestions that would be totally awesome!!      Thanks!!!!! :D

20090127011021AAcZTEh	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	Jalan menuju Grand Indonesia Jakarta?	Maaf, saya tinggal di luar Jakarta (daerah Banten) dan jarang sekali ke Jkt kecuali urusan penting. Saya hendak ke Grand Indonesia, tapi tidak tahu rute-nya. Yang saya tahu hanya daerah Taman Anggrek dan Grogol. Jika saya membawa mobil, selepas pintu tol Kebon Jeruk saya harus ke arah mana? Bagi saya, bunderan HI cukup membingungkan dan "menjebak". Salah-salah bisa ditilang polisi. Adakah yang punya ide apa yang sebaiknya saya tempuh? Ataukah sebaiknya saya naik kendaraan umum saja? Jika hendak naik busway, sebaiknya dari Taman Anggrek atau Grogol saya ke mana? Terima kasih.

Hi,      I will be travelling with 3 other adults and one child (age 2) in a few weeks to Disneyland we are flying into Charles de Gaulle airport in the afternoon and staying in the Santa Fe hotel in Disneyland.
