Bueno, en realidad es porke acabo de leer lo siguiente y quiero saber que opinan de ello:      "Históricamente, la sexualidad femenina ha sido ignorada y relegada. Por ello, las lesbianas viven una doble discriminación: a causa de su orientación sexual y de su género. Si apenas se toma en consideración una sexualidad femenina libre e independiente, difícilmente se va a considerar la sexualidad lésbica. En casi todos los ámbitos de nuestra sociedad el hombre dispone de una mayor visibilidad y de mayor poder económico y social. A la mujer se le ha otorgado el espacio de lo privado. Esto conduce a las lesbianas a una situación de extrema invisibilidad"

Madeline Kara Neumann, una ni?a diabética de 11 a?os falleció el domingo de Pascuas en  Wisconsin, porque sus padres creían que sus plegarias serían más útiles que un médico para salvarla,     Según la policía, los padres "se dieron cuenta de que era grave ya que avisaron a sus allegados y a otras organizaciones confesionales para que los apoyasen en sus plegarias" dijo el capitán Scott Sleeter .   "Su fe es tal que creyeron que sus plegarias la salvarían, por ello tomaron esa decisión en lugar de llevarla a un médico", agregó Sleeter.       "PIDAN CON FE Y LES SERá CONCEDIDO" nos dicen...   ?Puede haber mayor fe, más absoluta y ciega que confiar únicamente en la oración para salvar a una hija que se muere en lugar de una mísera consulta médica?   ?Por qué no les fue concedida la curación? Dios padre misericordioso-etc-etc ?no oyó estas plegarias?   ?O será que hay cosas de las cuales nos tenemos que ocupar acá en la Tierra en lugar de esperar milagrosas intervenciones divinas?

Los cambios climatologicos que se han dado en los ultimos a?os son mas que suficientes para comprobar que nuestro planeta necesita ayuda.      Datos para todos aquellos que opinana que UNA SOLA PERSONA no hace una diferencia:    1. Anualmente, cada persona en promedio produce 9.44 toneladas de CO2 que ayudan a que el agujero de la capa de ozono se haga mas grande. Con solo unas cuantas medidas que no cuestan ni tiempo ni dinero, se producen 2.80 toneladas de CO2 menos!   2. Haciendo la mayoria de tus pagos en linea y recibiendo estados de cuenta electronicamente, se dejan de desperdiciar mas de 1 tonelada de papel al a?o (aparte de que no gastas en sellos postales, filas en las tiendas, ahorras espacio en tu escritorio, y lo haces en 10 minutos).   3. Los carros hibridos, aunque mas caros que los carros convencionales, te dan mejor rendimiento con cerca de 100 millas por galon de gasolina, lo que significa que podrias ahorrarte hasta un 70% en gasolina al a?o.

20090223130908AAeOJVA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, the Bible says that Jabal's brother, Jubal, was the father of all who play the harp and flute?	In Genesis 4:20-21, it says that Jabal's brother, Jubal, was the father of all who play the harp and the flute. If you don't have a Bible nearby to read this passage then you can read it here online:    http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...    So does this mean that:   1) He invented the harp and the flute   2) Or he was the first one to find any musical use in playing the harp and the flute.   3) Or he was the first one to really experiment with these instruments and develop new techniques in playing them that we might use today and is therefore considered a pioneer   4) Or both numbers 2 and 3   5) Or is the harp and the flute symbolizing any instrument in general besides the harp and the flute and therefore we can apply numbers 1 through 4 to any other musical instruments?    6) Or all of the above      Also, do you know of any historical evidence outside the Bible, scientific evidence, as well as archaeological evidence that says this was so. I am not doubting in any way that this is true. But I want to see what the sources outside the Bible has to say about this. I would be very interested in reading about that.       Also for the people who follow other religions who might be reading this question and the nonreligious who might be reading this question as well, who do you say was the father of all who play the harp and the flute?

He said in his speech as a side note that he was proud to live in a country that would elect an elegant man as President.  Why do you think so many of them always have to say things like that?  It had nothing to do with his winning an Oscar so why even bring it up - so you can hear applause for your own thoughts?  Also he talked about Mickey Rourke rising again and being "his brother".  Well, where was Penn when Rourke only had his dogs and no one else?  This is what makes me turn off these award shows every year - these people are so full of themselves.

20090223112007AAusZV1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do I answer similar questions?	I was in the music section the other day, and someone mentioned a specific singer. I see questions about this particular singer all the time. I asked around - internet, friends, I even have a client who's a music executive - and it turns out this singer has never actually been seen. So I went back and asked someone who posts about this singer how they know the singer exists. He pointed me to an anthology of lyrics, but it turned out that none of the articles in the anthology had the same take on the lyrics. Then I found out that there are several such anthologies, and none of them agree, either. As it turns out, people are killing each other over who's anthology is better.      When I see questions about this singer, I now tend to say "Show me evidence this singer exists". Many of the die hard fans say I'm just musically dead or I could hear the songs. Some of them even say I have no business in the music section if I don't know this singer. What should I say?

For example: the Parable of the loafs of bread and the fish. Followers of Jesus gathered in large numbers. After listening to Him speak for hours they started to get hungry. Some had come prepared others did not. Upon getting some bread and fish Jesus performed a miracle and fed the multitude.   why don't everybody see that the miracle was not a magic trick? It was that Jesus "Shared The Wealth". He took from those who had abundant and gave to those who had none.

Note: when I say "intelligent" I'm talking iq wise         Of course this also means that there are a greater number of stupid religious people as well.

20090223124435AA5jtbH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Doesn't the destruction or severe decline of the human race concern you?	Most people, when asked what they think things will be like in 100, 200, 500, 1000 years in the future don't think we'll last that long.      Many have the opinion that we'll blow ourselves up, or that an epidemic will take hold, or that war will ravage the earth, or all of the above.      Well, doesn't that concern you?! Why don't YOU do something about that?      Why don't you dedicate yourself to studying, getting into a good university, getting a degree that would let you work on non-nuclear proliferation treaties?      Or why don't you dedicate your life to trying to cure epidemics?      Or why don't you dedicate your life to running for office yourself, and making this world a better place for our descendants?         If you seriously think humans are going to destroy themselves, why don't you do something about it?      Maybe you won't succeed, or maybe you won't do something that affects the entire world, but you can say that you tried and that you made a difference.       And who knows, maybe if a lot of people adopts this attitude, the world would be a better place.      So why don't you do something about it?

However, I was watching a documentary of a not-so-big channel of native tribes in South America.  The tribe casually walks around in the nude.  The channel ended up blurring out the male and female genitals but left the female breasts exposed.    I thought the censorship of the genitals was out-of-place.   There was nothing sexual or deviant with the tribes actions and therefore nothing sexual or deviant with the human body.         Did the channel go to far?  Or am I wrong for thinking they should've showed the tribe unedited?

20090223121235AAzlAgM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did not Jesus Christ himself teach that there is literal fire in “hell”?	Look at what he said in his parable of the rich man and the beggar Lazarus. Jesus said: “And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell [Latin, infernus]. And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom: And he cried, and said: .?.?. I am tormented in this flame.” (Luke 16:22-24, Douay) This parable was recorded by the Christian disciple Luke in the Greek language, and so he did not use the Hebrew word Sheol. The Roman Catholic Jerusalem translation of the Bible shows the Greek word used by Luke, for it reads: “The rich man also died and was buried. In his torment in Hades he looked up.” Ah, yes, the Greek word Ha′des is here used. And is there fire in Ha′des for tormenting the dead, as The Jerusalem Bible would make it appear?    Why does the Greek word Ha′des that is here translated as hell (infernus) have the same meaning as the Hebrew word Sheol?       Why does it not have the idea of Ha′des that is taught in the pagan Grecian mythologies?

I should've thought more clearly at the time ;/ I was just hoping that he would be happy with the trade, so I didn't even think about getting his liscence or anything. All I knew is that he drove a big blue van and looked to be a about 18 years old.      Anyways, I started browsing all the MySpace schools that were in my area (Iowa). I had actually found him through MySpace. Even the 3 guys that were with him during the transaction are in his friend's list. The blue van is even in one of the pictures! They seem to be into that "Thug" life style with all the bling, tattoos, and shiney ball caps.      Here is my problem: I now have solid proof of who did this. However, I'm aware that the punishment is great. These guys were all 17-20 years old (according to MySpace). Should I call the detective who is working on the case? What about the teachings of Jesus: If someone takes something from you, don't ask for it back. What do I do?      I admit that I really needed that $500.00. However, this could really hurt the lives of those who traded me this money. They are young and dumb, yet, have plenty of time to change their lives.      I feel that Jesus will be upset with me if I tell the detective this information. Another part of me just wants to get my stuff back and pretend that this never happened (what I really want to do). Yet a third part of me is affraid that they will have friends who will come after me if I testify.      What would you do? I really need the advice :(

20090223111443AAnRvnU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will you really go to hell for murder?	I'm sure I've killed thousands of ants on purpose in my lifetime, that in human terms would be mass murder, genocide by some. So, if all creatures are living, and God created all these creatures, isn't killing thousands of ants the same thing as killing thousands of humans? Keep in mind these murders were not for survival, but rather just, I wanted them out of my house. And so if you think it's irrational to go to hell for killing those ants, why is it rational to go to hell for killing humans? Even thousands of humans. Sure you could bring up the arguement, the universe was made for us, and so if you kill another of the "most supreme creation by God, you should go to hell. But was it really made for us? Out of the 200 billion + galaxies in the universe, there is an almost 100% chance that there will be another race equal to or smarter than us, that are not human. Why should we be so egotistic that we think the universe was made selectively for us?

20090223121754AA9ZKlD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If Protestants are going to quote the Catechism of the Catholic Church, can they find Protestant beliefs?	This protestant has an honest reason.  He sees the heresy and contradiction in the CCC.  He quotes Paragraph 868, to him it is a truth.      Paragraph 819, the Protestant knows, is something he knows Novus Ordo catholics are not supposed to believe but there it is, in all its Apostolic glory.  He knows that they don't hold it to be true, and it is against their new doctrine of Vatican II, but there it is.         The Protestant remembers when Catholics respected Pope Pius XII. And all the popes before him.  It isn't his thinking, but he knows that no one would call those people uncatholic.  What about today?  Do they even know about popes before Vatican II?      The Protestant knows the CCC where contradicts itself.  It states the opposite in Par. 868, which IS their new doctrine, one of false ecumenism and religious liberty, he, the Protestant, holds to be true, and THIS is against the Doctrine of Christ in Par. 819.  The Protestant knows which doctrine can be found in any Manual of Apologetics, the kind of book these CCC people will never dare pick up and read.  He has studied Patristics, and he knows.  Christ's Doctrine puts an anathema on the false ecumenism and religious liberty.      It is to the Protestant's credit that he can point to the real doctrine, which for him is heresy, but for the True Church it is not. This Protestant knows the Doctrine of the Catholic Church and he is obviously smarter than the Novus Ordo who are reading the words in Paragraph 819 and don't understand them.      Protestants claim that popes can become heretics.  Catholic Doctrine agrees.  It is the Novus Ordo of Vatican II who deny it.  No one ever claimed that a pope cannot become a heretic. In fact, the Canons of the Church provide the punishment for such a pope should he happen to commit heresy. It is that he is removed from office, and the chair is vacant. Sede Vacante, chair empty.   This has now happened five times since 1958. There have been no legitimate popes since Pope Pius XII, a sainted pope.   Is there anything in the bible that can tell us how many more of these imposters we have to endure before they are all kicked out? Protestants, you probably have the insight to know.  Can you tell them?        Protestants!  Help these Novus Ordo to return to Catholicism.  As it is, they don't even make it as Protestants.  They are Roman Protestants, with a mixture of any doctrine.        No Salvation Outside the Church.  This is a de fide dogma, established by the previous popes of the past to which the Novus Ordo heretical church no longer obeys. Paragraph 819 is a perfect example of the heresy of the pope who wrote the encyclical on "Ecumenism" and "Religious Liberty," both heresies against the True Church. Many Catholics are still alive, raising their children to be True Catholics, in an era when there is no present Vicar of Christ.       Catholics belong to that Catholic Church of Pope Pius XII. Do any of you dare to not call them Catholic? The Church in hiding is found in private chapels around the world, not SSPX or any other such anagrams, but by individual valid priests who would not have anything to do with the heresy of Vatican II and the heretical church it spawned.      If anyone wants to know the REAL Catechism of the Church, the one that the Protestant KNOWS says what it is supposed to say, and is what Catholics believe, it is the Catechism of Trent, or of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, the Baltimore Catechism. Vatican II will have nothing to do with THESE catechisms.

We don't have proof that the houses we move into don't have a roof that will cave in when we step inside, we just figure that they won't. So, if we needed proof for everything, we'd be paranoid.

When God said "Indeed! the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil!"  Who is the "us" he is referring to?  More Gods?  Angels?  Is there more than one God?      2.)  Eve bore Cain and Abel with the help of the Lord not Adam.  Then when Adam was 130 years old he became father of a son in his own likeness, Seth.  Was Seth conceived with Eve? Furthermore, these were all men.  When did the first lady come about?        3.)  If Adam and Eve were the first two humans and they had children wouldn't that mean incest?  Isn't that wrong?  They walked among God would he allow such behavior?      I'm asking such serious questions because I'm confused.  The bible confuses me.  There are just too many loop-holes.  Too much that seems wrong.  Is there chapters left out?  The bible has many versions.  Who's to say that whoever had the bible thousands of years ago didn't change the text to their liking?  Something this old had to be tampered with by man.  I'm trying to decide whether or not to switch from Baptist to Scientology.  I feel if God said we have become as he then their are powers that we simply do not know how to master and I want to learn!  Not to challenge him but to enlighten myself as much as possible.  Please help me.  Thank you.

People on here keep saying Satan is an angel and he cannot be killed but only banished out of heaven.  Okay, so does he walk the earth and in the final battle wouldn't hell be like a playground to him?  I hate Satan.  Am I wrong to hate him?  People keep referring to free will and that if we were perfect then it would be boring but when we get to heaven isn't that what it's all about?  Living perfect?

20090223120558AAoVC6Y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How are you spiritual without being religious?	I'm hoping there is a good answer to this question.  For the past few years I've reviewed the arguments for and against the major organized religions out there. I now have greatly diminished respect for those religions and many of their followers.  I feel like I just saw my dad dressed up as Santa Clause - and now there is no going back to believing in a magic sled.  So  I am agnostic.        At the same time I know research confirms that spiritual/religious people tend to be happier. Even though religions are probably nonsense, I can't help but think that the human soul continues.  Can you testify, and possibly explain, a satisfying spiritual nature "without" being confined to a sacred text or dogmatic belief?

20090223113708AAuNVHO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this normal christian behaviour?	Hi, (im sorry for saying boyfriend alot its just i dont want to use his name incase he sees it lol) I'm an 18 yr old atheist.      I have always been very respectful of other people and their beliefs but some past experiences make it hard to:      When I was 16 My boyfriend got kicked out because his born again christian parents didn't want him to be with me as they didnt want us having sex  before marriage.  For starters I think this is very hypocritcal because I know that they definately didn't wait until marriage to have sex and have heard from a number of people that know of the mother that her and her husband split up temporarily a few years ago and during that times he slept around ALOT!!  I hate the way that because they have been "born again" they can just forget about all their "sins" and then throw their own son out onto the streets because he is a sinner lol.  They gave him an ultimatum - never see me again or leave the house.  for a while we just lied and said we werent seeing eachother but then his dad would try and spy on us and do video phonecalls to make sure! so eventually he got kicked   out and they had the locks changed.      They are so controlling and patronising to people who dont have the same faith as them, they are always on the defensive and are very narrow minded when it comes to seeing things from mine and my family's perspective.  His dad is a complete bully he was violent and aggressive and "disowned" his son because of all of the horrible ideas being put into his head by his church. Its as if they are scared of doing wrong and would rather lose their son than look bad in front of their church - they live in fear, the church is putting such nasty horrible thoughts into their heads .  His dad once started reeling off statistics to my mum about teenage pregnancy (which I am not condoning but at 16 we should have been able to make our own mistakes, plus if his parents hadn't taught him that sex was forbidden and wrong, and had been more open about the subject, he would have been more  knowlegable and mature when it came to sexual relationships.  luckily for him my mum had well informed me about safe sex etc so i had my head screwed on! but he did not have a clue).  The dad started telling my mum that her parenting was rubbish (as if she was encouraging me to have sex lol - no she wasnt she  was just alot more open and less controlling as a parent).  They are so old fashioned as well shes a housewife who has no life no friends just stays in the house looking after the kids and cleaning, she cant drive, nothing.  And they think thats a womans place!  It just annoys me that they never bought my boyfriend up as a christian and yet expected him to just naturally be one??  I must also stress that my boyfriend is so lovely doesnt smoke drink, is never rude or argumentative with his family, they purely chucked him out cos he had a gf.      i just find it all horrible and would hate to be so controlled by my religion - christians are supposed to be nice arent they?  but they are just  bullies.  he just is so controlled by them when hes around them he goes all stuttery and nervous and no matter how bad they treat him he'l always go back to them because they can play this "happy family" act.  They can't be happy can they?       Is this really what christians are like or are they just psychos???  They have the right to their belief of no sex before marriage, they can tell their son that they do not agree with it, but they do not have the right to control him and to stop him from doing it, everyone has the right to freewill.      Argh just annoys me soooooo much.
20090223115018AAIlSeI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are good ideas to get children involved with the church?	the children here have no movie theater, no bowling ally. Fact is this town consists of one grocery store, one gas station, one hardware store, one lumber yard, two gas stations, one restaurant, one pharmacy and the 2 schools and 2 churches. The population is 90% Native American. What there is here is plenty of drugs and booze and I would think the unemployment rate is way up there in the double digits. I would love to find something for these children to do. Not something that is seasonal, something that is full time. And yes there is a boyscout and girl scout troop with members of perhaps 10 or 20...so that doesn't go well here. Please throw ideas at me even if they sound silly to you.

20090223142014AA19o2i	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did Jesus have the potential to sin?	I was speaking with a chaplain recently in a hospital. And he told me that Jesus had the potential to sin while he was on Earth, but never yielded to it. I then felt the need to ask him some very serious questions. I asked him, how can God sin? Isn't Christ's divinity the cornerstone of Christianity? And if He had the potential to sin at that time, what's stopping Jesus from sinning now? He seemed to have no clear answer. But he asked me how could Jesus be truly tempted, if He didn't have the potential to fall. I don't think he has a clear understanding of the purpose of the temptation of Christ, nor the nature of Christ . But who am I to argue with a chaplain. I stand firm in my belief. But what is your opinion?

20090223140729AAIyzsH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is God really just electricity?	Has anyone ever considered this? Electricity is the invisible force that binds all things together. The elements are magnetically attracted to other elements to create chemical bonds and molecules. Electricity is also at work in our own bodies. Electric impulses allow neurotransmitters to send signals which allow our brain to have memories and emotions. We can see that electric radio waves can travel through space with our tv's and radios. Could God be at work in this force? Is this force God? And will learning more about electricity bring us closer to God? Maybe electricity is the Holy Spirit? I'm gonna take another couple of hits of acid and then I'll see if I can figure this out.

20090223135903AAp1jc7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would the ancestors of today’s Christians be arguing as vehemently for the existence of polytheistic gods?	The concept of monotheism, particularly Jewish monotheism, was at one stage introduced to the ancestors of today’s Christians and replaced polytheism. Many of the ancestors of today’s Christians believed and were content with their beliefs for many generations, in polytheistic gods. You know, if they wanted to ensure a good harvest, they would make an offering to the god of agriculture. If their village was being threatened by a rival tribe, they’d make an offering to the god of war. If they were having trouble conceiving a child, they’d make an offering to the goddess of fertility.      If you had have gone up to these guys and tried to convince them that there is not many gods but just one god and all these other gods that they’ve been believing in for thousands of years are false gods, would these ancestors of today’s Christians react the same way that today’s Christians react when their beliefs are challenged?
20090223151141AATfa3y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religious people: do you like your ideology summarized as, “The practice of believing stuff without evidence”?	I mean, that’s really what it comes down to, right? All these holy books, rituals and ceremonies etc, are just smoke and mirrors, you know, devices to create an illusion of reality, right? At the end of the day, the stuff you believe and that you trick your children into believing just doesn’t exist! It’s not part of reality. Sure, I can’t prove it’s not part of reality but nor can you guys prove that there are no invisible leprechauns behind you right now, but if you’re going to live your life believing that there are invisible leprechauns making faces at you behind your back, well, that’s no way to live. Sooner or later you have to draw a line between what you know is real and what is just imaginary and gods, afterlife scenarios, nonsensical creation accounts, angels and demons etc, this stuff is not real; it’s just imaginary, right? Come on…
20090223152241AA7kRe2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: do you sometimes pray to Jesus for some things and your ‘God’ for other things?	I think you guys associate your ‘God’ with dispensing justice to people who you perceive to be bad people and I think you associate Jesus with performing miracles. I know you guys seem reluctant to admit that you think of Jesus and your ‘God’ as two separate entities, but in your head, you do attribute different personalities to your ‘God’ and Jesus, right?
20090223135845AADz751	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are you enjoying all the Gifts that the Holy Spirit is supposed to give?	It's a long list of wonderful qualities, but what I hear from believers is that the Holy Spirit was leading them and so on, but not much about all those great things that the Holy Spirit is supposed to bring (the whole list sounds a bit like perfection to me).      So are you, or anyone you know enjoying all the Gifts that the Holy Spirit is supposed to bring?

20090223151211AAifdpi	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	Does logic sometimes escape you?	The Sierra Club and the US Forest Service were presenting an alternative to Louisiana dog breeders for controlling the Alligator population. It seems that after years of the breeders using the tried and true methods of shooting and/or trapping the predator, the Tree-huggers had a 'more humane' solution. What they proposed was for the Animals to be captured alive, the males castrated and let loose again and the population would be controlled.      This was proposed to the Louisiana Dog Breeder’s Association by the Sierra Club and the USFS. All of the dog owners thought about this amazing idea for a couple of minutes.      Finally, ol’ Thibideaux in the back stood up, tipped his hat back and said,   "Mais, I don't tink you understan’ da problem. Dose Gators are EATIN' my dogs…….."

20090223140320AAajsKk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How would you know that something you believed in was not a *Delusion*?	What proof could you produce stating *You definelty were not believing a delusion?      Here is what GOD SAYS:        And for this cause God shall send them {n} strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:      2:11 For this cause God shall send them strong delusion. Because they do not receive the truth.      That they should believe a lie. He who refuses to receive the truth will at last believe lies. It is the law of human nature. God sends the delusion by natural laws. SOUND FAMILIAR?         God judicially sends hardness of heart on those who have rejected the truth, and gives them up in righteous judgment to Satan's delusions (Isa 6:9, 10; Ro 1:24-26, 28). They first cast off the love of the truth, then God gives them up to Satan's delusions, then they settle down into "believing the lie": an awful climax (1Ki 22:22, 23; Eze 14:9; Job 12:16; Mt 24:5, 11; 1Ti 4:1).      strong delusion-Greek, "the powerful working of error," answering to the energizing "working of Satan" (2Th 2:9); the same expression as is applied to the Holy Ghost's operation in believers: "powerful" or "effectual (energizing) working" (Eph 1:19).
20090223143519AAXzf4k	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Scoffers, GOD-deniers..Do you all have a Rational Mind based on a Model for Society?	To live by?   If it is what is it?   behaviour, beliefs, arguments, policies, and other exercises of the human mind may all be described as rational. To accept something as rational is to accept it as making sense, as appropriate, or required, or in accordance with some acknowledged goal, such as aiming at truth or aiming at the good..      Religion has worked for many who embraced it first the Jews who took the Commandments of GOD and could live in a society that would prosper, it would enable people in that community to live by rules and guidelines by a Divine Nature rather than MAN who could enforce Tyranny on people like the Roman and Grecian Civilizations did.      Many other fourth coming  Monotheistic religions did as well..      So take a Community of Rational minds.. What does society and government look like with only RATIONAL MINDS running the show??

I think we should take a stand, take away straight marriage for a while... see how they like it      its not that we hate the straights, we just don't think they should get married!       Huh, this is a weird question...isnt it!

20090223151124AADRAW0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I don't get it, how does Jesus getting killed make my sins go away?	I don't get it, Jesus gets whipped to death and some nails through his hands and all of a sudden if I kill a man and beg forgiveness I get to party in heaven      It doesn't make sense.  How does Jesus being dead make my and your sins go away completely?  Couldn't god have just said, "Your sins are pointless now go on for the rest of your life just acknoweledge me once in a while." Instead of getting a human pregnant then killing his love-child as a message that our sins are gone.      You tell me your opinion because this is the entire concept of christianity and it seems to have some major flaws.

20090223145446AAE933A	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have you ever had a problem telling people you are an atheist?	I'm sure it's not like this in all areas, but where I live (in a Christian-orientated suburb in Texas), atheism isn't exactly accepted.       And while I'm not going to go around screaming it, I fear those close to me will look at me in a negative light should the conversation of religion or God arise (which it too frequently does). Still, I'm not going to hide my beliefs- I don't and will not falsely represent myself in any way. My Baptist mother and Catholic father were quite shocked and we've had some tough conversations and debates. Because they are my family and I am very close to them, I had no problem letting them know.

She keeps texting me during class and my phone is always on vibrate and you can actually hear it vibrate. She got me in trouble today and my phone got taken away and I got written up so I got pissed at her and we had an argument and now she won't talk to me (I snatched my phone when the dismissal bell rang!)

However, they said that religion doesn't pertain to a belief in God, and that there are Godless religions out there.      I am one to believe that how a word is defined is based upon popular use.

We met in our PE class and decided to hangout one weekend. Ever since then we were inceprable. We did absolutly everything together for the next 6 months. We both agreed that we'd always stay best friends no matter what ever  happened.    About a month ago her parents caught us up in a lie and told us we couldn't hangout for a month. It sucked but we still hungout anyways. We started not to get along as well we bickered alot but we still always sat together and talked at school.   Then I kind of did something bad (I'm not going to go into detail), i feel really bad for it. Her parents said we couldnt never hangout again. We weren't friends for like a week, but then I apologized to her face to face and she said it was okay and that we are still best friends. I thought everything was going to be okay, but we were sorta akward around eachother. She seemed like she didn't really care if we hungout anymore. She said she did but only said it once and doesn't act like it all.   How am  I supposed to stay best friends with someone when there parents hate me?? I mean I wanna stay friends with her because she is still my best friend, its just hard because we can only see eachother at school. I just wish it could go back to the way it was when her parents let us hangout 24/7. Ahhh IDKK WHAT TO DO!!   helpp?

I am doing my research paper on "Religion in Schools" i was wondering where the best, and most importantly, the most credible sites for referance. (.edu, .gov. and .ed are probably the best)       i believe i will have to give opinions on both sides but i am leaning towards better sites for "against" because of my own personal beliefs.       I DONT CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT WHY IT SHOULD OR SHOULDNT BE IN SCHOOLS, JUST LINKS OR VIDEOS OR W/E. IM TIRED OF EVERYBODY STARTING ARGUMENTS ABOUT RELEGION ON HERE. so please just help me with starting my research ? thanks.

20090223155052AAh85WE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think its great that the new Pope is taking a hardline stance against Evolution?	I wasn't aware that Pope Benedict sacked his astronomer-priest counsellor who defended Darwinism. Apparently the priest claimed that intelligent design theory was a religious movement lacking any scientific merit.        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...       Meanwhile a close friend of the Pope's,Cardinal Schonborn, claimed that evolutionism was tantamount to atheism.      He argued that Darwinian concepts of "random variation and natural selection" were incompatible with the Catholic belief that there is a divine purpose and design to nature.       So, the Catholic church is finally getting rid of the Darwinists in clerical clothing who claim that science knows more than religion, and see the absurdity in defending atheistic evolutionism. The heinous ideologies are two sides of the same stinking coin.      If you are a Catholic, are you happy with the Pope' decision?

20090223153332AA0CsWX	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What should I do when I'm pressured to drink?	I was at my brothers twenty first the other night and my family and lots of their friends were there.  I'm 18 year old male from Ireland and I don't really drink that much because I don't really like the taste of most alcohol.  If I drink I usually just have a beer or two or some cider.        Some family members put me under real pressure to drink.  I told them no that I didn't really want anything and I was fine and they looked at me as if to say:  "What's wrong with you?".  They kept nagging me to drink until I finally just gave in to shut them up.  They probably just wanted me to relax and have a good time, but I really don't appreciate them telling me what to do just because they see it as the social norm.      What should I do in future if this happens?  I've talk to them before about this but they keep persisting.
