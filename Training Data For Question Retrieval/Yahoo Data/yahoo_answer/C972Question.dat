Malgré le parcours presque parfait de ses joueurs, il lui reste l'amertume de ne pas avoir enlevé le trophée. "Non, il n'y a rien à faire. Pour moi, cela reste un échec. Les gens, par leurs témoignages touchants, arrivent à me faire changer, un peu. Dans ces moments-là, je me dis que c'était bien quand même.

20070430163337AAbq1El	Sports;Other - Sports	Surely, mere American commentator bias ... ??	It seems to me that i note many [so-called] "experts" who write publicly about the game seem to have little fairness and reality in their perceptions and comments regarding 'the Greats' of all-time.      I note, this morning, for instance, that as I read a Wik comment on Chris Evert-Lloyd that the writer they refer to considers the 3 greatest female players of all time to be:   Stefi Graf   Martina Navratilova   Chris Evert-Lloyd      Now, you may say, "Well, Graf isn't American"...   That maybe true, but 2 things:   Her 'generation' has been one where the advances of modern technology has allowed commentators all over the world easy armchair access to the top players of the circuit.   Secondly, surely her long-tme Agassi relationship has penetrated American heart at one level or another.      Navratilova spent most of her playing years in America.      I have even heard various other American commentators claim the 'honor' of top spot for Billy-Jean King!         Now, my obvious objection to all this rating is that surely a more realistic and objective analysis reveals that Margaret Smith/Court, of Australia, was the greatest all-around player of all time, without question.      She won by far, the most number of Grand slam tournaments, and she won them anywhere!   She also won the most women's doubles titles, and took out her solid share of mixed doubles tournaments as well.   She proved that she could win anywhere, with any partner and under any type of condition.   REALISTICALLY, SHE HAS TO BE TOPS??

20070402220934AAfRDBz	Sports;Basketball	FIBA Point System?	What particular basketball tournaments is the point system (2 points for each win, 1 point for each loss and 0 point for each loss by forfeit or default) by FIBA applied?      Normally at the end of the elimination round the ranking / standing is determined according to the win-loss records of each team. Is the point system as stated above a tool to break a tie say for a 3 way tie? For 2 way ties, the "win over the other" rule applies. For 3 way ties, normally we look at the head to head results amongst the 3 teams only. If one or two of the team/s has / have forfeited a game against a team that is not included in the 3 teams that are tied, will this forfeited game have an effect on breaking the tie?

20090205131301AAcaFgK	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	A little un-sure.... ?	This year, I've decided to not join the local modified trap team. I'm more or less torn between actually joining and as of now I've decided not to.  I don't wanna join cause of how I was treated at State Comp. and how I was treated on the team by a lot of the folks out there. My score didn't count at State and I shot better than 2 of the guys who's scores counted. And at practice, I'd always have to take score and I couldn't talk with everyone like the guys did/do. And 2 of the 5 coaches wasn't really for me being out there either..   Is it wrong to feel like that? I've dealt with a lot of things like "a girl shouldn't do that" by a few folks on the team and most of my uncles.       I've accomplished a lot and I've 'fallen in love' with trap shooting lol. I'm not giving up shooting, I'm just giving up on the county's team.    I enjoy competitively shooting too      Do yall know of any ways that I could possibly still competitively shoot?       if it helps, I'm 18 and it's my last year in high school

I know the sales will start at the end of this season, so i was thinking should i wait and buy the snowboarding jacket and pants when the sales are on ( they will start in april or maybe may. Sometime around that time. ) and save the jacket and the pants for next winter ( Like not use it until next winter, just keep it in the closet ) ?   And also, should i buy the jacket and the pants in a very big size ( so it is very much over sized )  or just a little to big for me  ( so it's just a bit big but not very big ) or just in the exact size i'm in now ?      Thanks :)

OK,   I really need a snowboard i found a snowboard that has boots,bindings and ofc. the board for only $ 563 all in a package,   it's a very nice board and it's really nice shaped and everything.   I really need the board because I've been renting for a long long time now ! isn't it just cheaper to buy a board ?   my dad says that i should wait tho, because at the end of this season there will be allot of sales. But at the end of the season the snow will probably be all GONE !!   which is not good..      But should the buy a snowboard package for $ 563,?   or should I wait for the sales to come the end of this season and rent a board whenever i go snowboarding ( which will probably cost allot of money ) ?    i'm very impatient ( so i really want to buy the board now ) lol. soo yeah ,      please leave some suggestion on what I should do ! :D

I don't think it's a slump like the ones before.ever since after the 2005 confederations cup it's been a decline of sorts.the 2006 world cup had Mexico in probably the easiest group of the world cup.angola and iran?   I saw Mexico only win one game against a very weak team.   angola also was very weak.      then they barely made it by pansazo into the group stage.   then the 2007 gold cup was horrble for Mexico.they got toasted by honduras.then by the USA.      the copa america 2007 was great until they met Argentina but it may have been a last gasp effort by Mexico that got them that far in the copa america.      now 2008 was a devastating year for Mexico with the pre olympic qualifying squad getting eliminated in the group stage.      now 2009 doesn't seem very bright and I don't think this is a slump anymore.this last 3 years has been very hard on Mexico with only 1 shining moment.the 2007 copa america.      that's it.I don't think this is just any old slump anymore.      what do you think?

Is there a major skill difference?      I went out with my fiance's father to shoot clay pigeons. I hadn't done this since I was about 14 or 15 years old, and I was in the Army since then as a Scout/Sniper in an infantry batallion. I've had alot, and I mean Alot of training with weapons; although I could NOT hit any of these clay pigeons!   We were firing 12 and 16 gauges. When I would hit the pigeons, I would hit the side, not completely destroying the pigeons.      In the same day, I shot a penny off of a very thin stick at 55 yards away with open sights with a .22 calibur rifle.   I'm an excellent, prestine shot with a rifle; but I couldn't hit crap with the 12 and 16 gauges!   Another thing that I might add, is that when our "pullers" would pull the pigeons, they were throwing them way out past a range where the dove shot and buck shot could effectively hit them.   I would be at the rear of their trajectory and I STILL could not hit them!   I aimed higher, and still nothing!      I always assumed that shotguns were meant for close to mid-ranged targets...   Although it was funny that my fiance's father could hit every single one almost every time... and he had no real military or special training with weapons.         Does this mean anything? What's the difference?

On the first day, we have to run 3 miles under 22 minutes and on the second day, we have to run 2 miles. After that they'll start the cuts.      I can dribble well and have a good control on the ball. I also juggle and freestyle everyday.      Frankly, I've started running only this week for 30 minutes each day ( idk how far 5 miles is because I don't have that distance device thing, so I just run by time) and I'm starting to get into shape. So if I run 4 to 5 miles everyday starting tomorrow for 2 weeks full, do you think I can get into shape for the tryout? I will also be using one of those weights that you put on your feet to be stronger. And should I do a lot of sprinting??      please, please, please help me if you have ANY advice!!!   thank you!

20090205154143AAfa0Tt	Sports;Hockey	Are you FOR or AGAINST tanking?	In the Leafs group on facebook there is always the division amongst Leaf fans who are for and against tanking. The ones for tanking argue that we aren't gonna win the Stanley Cup this year or anywhere in the near future unless we don't tank and get good draft picks. The ones against tanking want us to win and believe we are gonna win the Stanley Cup this year and they believe "tank nation" are not true Leaf fans.       Are you for or against tanking? Do you think fans who want their team to tank the season are not true fans? What is your overall opinion on tanking? If you were a GM would you get rid of your players in an attempt to tank the season for a good draft pick?         AND for the record, when I say tanking I do not mean purposely throwing away games, I mean cheering when your team is losing and rooting for your team to lose so they can get a better draft pick.

20090205143612AAkh94X	Sports;Baseball	Should the Mets give Edgardo Alfonzo an invite, since they need a right-handed bat on the bench & weak at 2B?	I think it's an outside the box idea. I relate it to how Omar Minaya gave Fernando Tatis a chance. The Mets gave Tatis a chance, who had only played professionally in one of the previous four seasons, prior to last season. It turned out Tatis was productive and will platoon with Murphy in LF this season. The Mets also gave Nelson Figueroa a chance last season, who hadn't been in baseball for 4 seasons, and he contributed in first month and a half of the season.      What do they got to lose here? The worst case scenario is he goes back to the Long Island Ducks. In '99, he moved over to 2B for the Mets and had an awesome year. He had a great year in 2000 too. He came up in the Mets system and lasted there a while, so I think he's at least earned this.

20090205151743AAoiqbX	Sports;Wrestling	Who would win these matches?	DWF Thursday Night Deathzone   Last week there were 3 elimination chamber qualifiying matches. Batista, John Cena and Edge won those matches and will be involved in the 6 man chamber match at No way Out. Tonight we will expect to see the last 2 participants.      Match 1. IC Title- X-Pac (c) vs John Morrison vs Bobby Lashley in a triple threat match      Backstage we see Edge with GM Paul Heyman. Edge tries to persuade Heyman to make edge the final person to enter the elimination chamber match by just saying lies about how he is a great GM and big show didnt give him title shots. Paul cuts edge's lines as he says that the board of directors are still investigating who knocked Big Show out. Edge looks suspiciously as heyman leaves.      Paul Heyman comes out and has some announcements to make. Next week on WAR we will have all 6 elimination chamber participants compete in a 6 man battle royal match. Whoever is the last man standing will be enter the chamber the latest.      Match 2. Elimination Chamber Qualifiying Battle Royal match   Last 2 standing- Evan Bourne and Mark Henry (choose who wins)   After the match Batista comes out and furiously attacks Bourne until Rey Mysterio comes out and saves evan. Mark Henry and Batista walks back.      Match 3.Festus w/Jesse vs Chavo Guerrero      Randy Orton and Chris Jericho comes out to do contract signing for the #1 contendership match at No way Out. Randy Orton signs first and then Jericho. But then Jericho steps back and says that he has something else in mind. Since Orton Cheats in 95% of his matches, Jericho requests the match at No Way Out to be a No Disqualification match. Orton accepts the challenge and Jericho signs the contract, After he does that, Orton quickly goes for an RKO through the table on Jericho but Y2J is smart enough that he Hits a steel chair on Orton first.       Match 4. MVP vs Road Dogg      RVD and Edge are sitting on the couch backstage.RVD "requests" Edge to help him win the elimination Chamber match at No way Out to retain his World title. Edge says that hes helped RVD too much in the past and everytime RVD successfully defends his title against Cena, The Rock, Batista, and even the Undertaker. Edge says at the Elimination Chamber all the friendship will end as he will go by himself to win the World title.       Match 6. Parking Lot Brawl, John Cena vs CM Punk      Match 7. World Tag Team titles-   Dudley Boys (c) vs Rob Van Dam and Edge   After the match Edge turns on RVD by hitting a spear on him. Edge says that hes done all those stuff for RVD in the past and now its his time to shine at No Way Out.

Man Utd vs Liverpool- It's not so much the violence as the rivalry. It's a competition of success.      4. Newcastle vs Sunderland- Again, not as violent as the top 2, but plenty of rivalry, and a tinge of hatred for some reason! But mostly it's competitiveness to the max!      5. Wolves vs West Brom- I've been to this derby, and it's pretty fierce. They don't like each other, and because they're both so close geographically and football-wise, it's always competitive.

20090205150157AAzTtaF	Sports;Golf	Do you think that playing courses that are shorter or easier make your index better then it should be?	I understand that course rating and slope are supposed to make up for discrepancies in the toughness of a course.  I just feel that playing on an easier course, especially a shorter one allows for easier scores.  For me anyway, if I can keep the driver in the bag more often, then I am going to score better.  I almost always play the back tees at every course I play.  Normally they range anywhere from 6,800 - 7,200, and I carry an index at the moment of 3.0, although my scoring average is 79.2.  If I go play a shorter course, or play a different set of tees, I many times beat my index average.  Does anyone else notice this in their scoring?  I would venture to say my index would be 1-2 right now, if I constantly played the "one up" tees, or even shorter.  That is just based on looking at those scores the few times I have played up tees, or short courses.  The distance of the course is tougher then the few strokes they knock off on the rating in my opinion.  I have no problem with distance off the tee as far as ball length, but I get wild with that driver at times.  Since the hole is say 450 from the back tees, it almost forces you to hit driver.        Does anyone else notice this in their scoring?

Here's why it would make them a dynasty:      If Lebron is making the players on the teams that he's on now imagine what he would do if he was on the lakers.Big Z is nowhere near as good as Andrew bynum or Pau Gasol.   Gasol and bynum already are good players,imagine if they having Lebron making great passes to them setting them up for easy shots.Lebron is a better passer and clearly better overall.Kobe is the better scorer and is more clutch.   back to what I was saying Lebron could basically do what he wanted cuz the lakers also have a lot of good 3 point shooters,so if he drives he can just kick out.they would also have 3 shot blockers which would be Lebron,Bynum and Gasol which would make there defense better.Lebron is also versatile and can play almost any positon.      Just think about it.I the lakers would win the next 4 or 5 championships if they had lebron.Dont get me wrong the cavs would be good with kobe but not as good as the lakers with lebron.what do yall  think?

20090205121306AACBCqH	Sports;Basketball	How Will the Celtics Get Past the Cavs this Year?	Can we agree that the Celtics aren't as good as they were last season?  -James Posey, -PJ Brown.  Many of us have seen Kobe and Lebron light up the Celtics so far in their 2 meetings this season.  They no longer have Posey to put on these guys, and when the big 3 aren't on the court, the bench loses the lead.  The Cavs are clearly a better team than last season with Mo Williams in the mix.  Come the playoffs, should the Celtics and Cavs meet, how will they be able to stop Lebron from running all over them again like he did with a Big Z less Cavs last meeting, especially since they won't have the luxury of having a James Posey?
