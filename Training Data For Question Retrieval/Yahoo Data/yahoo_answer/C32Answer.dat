YsUnEnYqaa	Any of the 03 MOS's.... Depends on what kind of action though? Tankers usually don't hang around nice places when deployed either. Though they are more susceptible to the typical POG mentalities and laziness.     Bear in mind that as an infantryman, in 4 years and 2 combat deployments, I could probably add up the sustained firefight time into 72+/- hours of no-**** "I'm being shot at, and I'm shooting at people" time. The rest of the 1460+ days were spent playing ****-**** games, waiting, training, and being miserable..... But I don't regret it, it's simply reality. Infantry most certainly are the most proud of the Corps.    Choose wisely.    EDIT: Yeah thumbs down!

Illegal Immigrants and Benefits    Its a widely held misperceptions: Undocumented immigrants pay no taxes but take advantage of a slew of taxpayer-supported federal benefits such as food stamps, Medicaid and Medicare (the health care programs for the poor and the elderly), Social Security, housing and hospital services.

Speech has never been analyzed by the effect on the listener (or watcher).  Instead, it is viewed in terms of communications.  By your argument, any speech that caused an involuntary physiological response would be subject to regulation.  You may not be aware, but simply reading or hearing anything --anything at all-- will cause a physiological response.  The presence of any external stimuli will have an effect on one's brain even it the effect is not immediately apparent to anyone.  So, in answer to your question I cannot see that argument being accepted by any court anywhere.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Very interesting argument!  But wrong, I think.    It would be different if pornography was on billboards, on network TV in prime time, etc.  But in most places pornography is only allowed 'under cover'.  For instance it's available all over the Internet but it doesn't just pop up on your screen (usually), you have to go looking for it.  So you can't make the argument that you didn't want to see it.    The argument against pornography is not 'We don't like it so we won't look at it', it's 'We don't like it so we don't think -anyone- should be allowed to look at it.'    Here where I live, there was an 'adult' magazine that was sold in newsstands.  Kids could see it through the plastic cover of the newsstand.  At first they put stickers over the boobs of the girls on the front pages, but later most places banned it being in public.  In magazine racks in places like Borders and Barnes and Noble, the adult magazines are under a cover, and you can't see them unless you reach in and pull one out--and then they are sealed in plastic so you can't just stand there and page through one.  (Supposedly, store employees are supposed to take them away from kids who look underaged, but you wonder how well that works.)    And though I don't agree with the idea of censorship, I like the idea of keeping it out of public view.  I don't have a problem with people looking at whatever they like in private, by their own choice.|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Of course speech can invoke involuntary physical response.

That is why our military is there and trying to do their best to make a better life for that country. The media brings down our military though and does not show how the real soldiers do it....they think the real storries are when a soldier kills an inocent bystander...they do not think at all about posting storries about how great our military is// I see some storries that are good, however, but not all of them.     My brother in law is taking R&R this week and I just found out he is coming home to NY to see his family out there...our soldiers need to be praised and not put down.

G4TJ8nibaa	The question is: " How long have you had your green card?"  If you have had your green card for more than 2 years it makes no difference.

That having been said, I am not happy with the stimulus package.  I think that Obama wasted his time trying to make concessions for the conservatives.

I applaud him for really trying to be bipartisan but now he's learning that apparently he's the only one who truly wants that, and that is sad.        As far as scandals and mistakes with appointments, I have to say that the many mistakes Bush made in his appointments - mistakes involving gross incompetence (Great job Brownie!) affected our country in many negative ways. At least these are being caught before they are in place and can do any real damage. Obama needs to revamp his vetting process, that is crystal clear. But when talking about scandals a Republican would do well to remember the unbelievable number of them that came to the forefront during the last 8 years.

Like I say, they are not getting kick backs for nothing.    Looking for the REAL answer!,  this is just another I told you so.    Stimulus': Your Money for Illegals, Welfare Recipients, Arts, and Sex     Just how outrageous is this shameful $819 billion stimulus?     For starters  and this will shock you  both the House and the Senate programs have a loophole that even gives illegal aliens cash payouts.     Heres how The Associated Press explained it: Undocumented immigrants who are not eligible for a Social Security number can file tax returns with an alternative number. A House-passed version of the economic recovery bill, and one making its way through the Senate, would allow anyone with such a number, called an individual taxpayer identification number (TIN), to qualify for the tax credits.     In case you didnt know it, any illegal can get a TIN number from Social Security, no questions asked.     This means illegals who broke the law to get here will be eligible immediately for federal cash  up to $1,000!     It gets worse. Let me detail for you some facts from the stimulus:     More than $4 billion is earmarked for "neighborhood stabilization activities"  money that will go to groups like ACORN, which worked closely with the Obama campaign, the same group accused of massive voter fraud.   Almost half of the proposed spending will directly benefit the Service Employees International Union, federal, state, and municipal employee unions, or other Democratic-controlled unions, according to writer Ben Stein.   $600 million goes for news cars for top government bureaucrats.   Obama promised major infrastructure projects  yet only 5 percent of all the money goes for this.   $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts.   $75 million to fund anti-smoking programs.   $650 million for the switch from analog television to digital.   $335 million to help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.   $600 million for climate change research programs.   This is just a small part of the long laundry list of trivial, weird, and simply outrageous programs being funded in the Obama stimulus bill, which goes on for 680 pages  so long no one in the House was believed to have read it before voting for it!     Just to show you the tremendous waste, there is so much money appropriated in this bill you could give every unemployed person in the nation a check for $75,000 for the amount being spent.|`|2c3628a29fcb7162c1558484804afdf8aa	NO, lets just keep giving banks trillions without any accountability for it.|`|RstCnGL2aa	A trillion here, a trillion there.

Maybe we have a different dictionary, but I don't see how giving $1 BILLION for the U.S. census count in 2010 helps the economy! How is that NOT pork? I mean READ THE BILL!    The simple thing is this...  Knowing what is (or is not) in this bill... Do YOU feel more comfortable spending now? If the answer is NO, then the bill is a failure.    Remember, 2/3 of GDP is CONSUMER SPENDING. If you are not spending your money, the money is not being spent... A "stimulus" package should do something that compels the people to spend.    (link to the bill below... read, study and KNOW THE TRUTH!)|`|k1jwNKbgaa	I don't support it....we need real stimulus, NOT a bunch of pay-offs to special interest groups or bloated bureaucracies.

How do you explain that?|`|AA10264185	Blaming the liberal media for everything is denial at it's highest. As long as Republicans blame outside forces rather than look at their own mistakes they will continue to lose elections. We should be thankful that they cling to this liberal media conspiracy illusion.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Independent groups have done studies which show that the media has a liberal bias. It's not a conspiracy theory, it's an established fact.    And, regarding education, there are a lot of teachers pushing liberal beliefs on the students. Especially concerning the environment or global warming.    And both professions have been shown to be overwhelmingly populated by self-identified liberals. When you have a newsroom with over 75% liberals, do you not think that their common viewpoint will not show thru in their reporting?    Perhaps you should open your mind and read "Bias" by LIBERAL Democrat Bernard Goldberg. It might open your eyes.

The funny part is that they watch FAUX because they complain about the "liberal" media and how everything they say is swallowed hook line and sinker.  Then they listen to their heroes on FAUX and proceed to parrot any talking point they present for the day.  People who complain about brainwashing who are brainwashed themselves by their chosen conservative media.  Talk about glass houses.|`|e4J0OfjDaa	Like spoiled children, whenever they lose they blame someone else.
qDdhDRenaa	Actually being liberal is about being responsible for everyone in this country as well as upholding the Constitution even in a time during a war we shouldn't have been in to begin with and making sure all Americans have equal rights as well as their basic needs they can't afford. In the United States, there are people who work hard every day and still can't meet their basic needs such as decent health insurance, a post secondary education which is essential in getting a decent job, and the possibility of a retirement. While countries in Europe are making sure that people have health insurance, the skills in getting a lifelong career, a decent retirement, and parental leave, the United States leaves its own people in the dust which is inexcusable for a rich country like ours. I don't care if I'm being a Socialist but we need to instate Universal Healthcare, a free Pre K to postsecondary education, and require all businesses to have parental leave for both male and female employees. I think that the War in Iraq has got to end because we shouldn't have been in there in the first place and it has done more harm than good for our self image in the international community. Government needs to regulate businesses so white collar crooks can be held accountable, big businesses don't get too powerful, unsafe products don't get on the market, and the working man doesn't get screwed. Also, we need to develop renewable technology that would allow us to coexist with the environment and reduce our intake on fossil fuels.|`|MLYQh8bMaa	Rose colored glasses only what they want to see.|`|ayhDyb16aa	Liberals work in an emotional dream world where logic is twisted by un realistic and un workable goals and a desire and a vision for some hopeless ideal of Utopia.|`|k6hicodfaa	Neither, but it is really naive to think the world only fits in dichotomies.|`|oHrqbdydaa	The true nature of the world is not survival of the fittest. That is an ignorant misreading of Origin of Species, which states quite clearly that those species who COOPERATE survive.    Which is why America is doomed by all this "liberal-conservative" nonsense.    We are screwed as long as you continue to think this way.|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	Intelligence makes us liberal. For example, look at your profile pic. Pyle was a character in the stanley kubrick's movie "Full Metal Jacket".     I am sure you love that movie as the war monger that you must be, being conservatives.    But your lack of knowledge is also one of your traits. Kubrick made that movie to make fun of the military, its practices, and to have a morale basically saying ... "war is really stupid".     But, you being conservative, you don't see that in this movie. All you see is guns!!     You gotta read books ... all the educated tend to go liberal ... look it up!!|`|11dGXLchaa	According to Urban Dictionary, Definition  35, a liberal is defined as a:    "Embittered, painfully self-righteous citizen who enjoys criticizing views that differ from his/her own. Often found speaking derogatory phrases against other political parties in the loudest voice possible, the liberal will not tolerate criticism of his/her beliefs in response.     Prefers to blame all economic speed bumps on conservatives, while not acknowledging folly in his/her own political party.     Proud of the fashionable, "edgy" label he/she possesses. This makes him/her feel artificially unique and intelligent.     Characteristics: hubris, defensiveness, ability to "pass the buck."   "I just don't feel comfortable around some people."   "Well you're WRONG! How can you be so stupid! You should be tolerant and loving like ME! I'm a liberal!"|`|RstCnGL2aa	Mental illness.    Just kidding.

Just ask any State or Federal worker, or anyone on Welfare, or SS, or Disability.    That is why Obama's stimulus bill will create many government jobs, and and very few private sector jobs, because people that receive money from the government vote for democrats.    Also liberals are pessimist's.|`|AA10168935	Liberals have more use of their right brain lobe and can see the big picture. You'll never understand them because you don't have that evolved of a mind.|`|Irjopfpvaa	The same reason that makes a conservative a conservative. Not all people think alike, and contrary to your dimwitted look at the world, liberalism is not a denial of the true nature of the world. It's the principle that humans deserve freedom and pursuit of happiness, and we only take up arms as last resort, not to imperialize and show other race or country we are superior to them.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	Actually it's the willingness to see the world as complex and not engage in black/white thinking.  Those on the right love simplistic duologies such as good/evil, free/oppressed, gay/straight, life/death, and this affection prevents them from discerning the complexities and nuances of difficult issues.|`|lx51F0gzaa	No.  It's knowledge that, right or wrong, we're supposed to think that ALL are created equal and ALL deserve to be treated that way.    It's compassion for humans and properly placed distrust of corporations and government entities.    It's knowing that money should not be the most important thing in life.    It's knowing that people who are different from us are not necessarily worse than us.    It's thinking of the big picture and not only of ourselves.    It's knowing the value of compromise and realizing that compromise is THE ONLY way to successfully govern this country.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	No, it's an unwillingness to accept that the way the world works can't be changed.|`|6Cp41lb6aa	If you watch any of the independent films the amateur Michael Moore's make (liberal documentaries), there are always three themes running throughout:    1) America / mankind has made a mess of things  2) We need a big government program to fix it.  3) People can't be trusted to fix it themselves.    Whether it's global warming, peak oil, endangered species, SUVs, alternative energy, discrimination, etc. etc. ad nauseum.    What's sorely lacking is any sense of hope, despite the last two Democratic president's campaigns:  Obama : The audacity of hope  Clinton : The young man from Hope, Arkansas.

HRCFViataa	Not even close.  I was in the army and I could (not now) do 300 sit ups easy, a 100 push ups (which to honest are not going to help with S.A.S selection), i could run a 1.5 miles 8.5 Min's, do a battle run (i.e run with fun kit for 2 miles, which is very very very hard) in 20 Min's, and ran 2 marathons, and I wasn't fit enough for selection.    One of the S.A.S fitness tests is a 52km run/tab across the brecon beacons (which is one of the hilliest area`s of the U.K), They get a map and full kit and weapon, and have 22hours to complete the course,  they get so long to reach each check point, if they miss it, they will not be given the location of the next, so are out.  It is not uncommon for soldiers to die on this run.|`|AA11423656	What you have described I would definately say no Chance at the moment. Keep up the hard work and you would pass standard army fitness test. Pick up a massive sack of spuds 22.5 add a further 10kg for belt kit then add to that the weight of rifle 6-7kg. Then try doing a 60km walk in 20hrs over the brecon beacon up and down hills in the worst of british weather. Add into that a few blisters and ankle and leg injuries.

Much of the selection course consists of rigorous route marching with heavy packs - it requires different strengths to running and pushups. Don't practice pack marching and generally getting fit for the SAS before you join the Army - You'll only injure yourself.

YsUnEnYqaa	If a young man wants to serve his country, I would hardly call that dishonorable (concerning the post above mine).     Sir, I would look at yourself with a realistic judgment. Can you run for 3+ miles and not die? Do you have it in you to do it and do it well? These are the REAL determining factors concerning this question if you are considering joining the military.     I will take drive, discipline, and determination over paper-based prerequisites and technicalities any day of the week. Start running, and get into a good endurance-type shape, and talk to a recruiter. I had mild asthma as well as a child, it was of no problem: 1) Because I was not suffering from it, and 2) Because I didn't MAKE it a problem.     That being said, don't show up wheezing and hacking up a lung. If you're still suffering from it, then you probably would be DQ'd.  Focus on the task ahead of you and make sure this is not an issue yourself. And if you find yourself in fit condition, I wouldn't even mention it to the recruiter or bring it up in the scare tactics they put on you in the admin phases of boot camp.    Concerning your eyesight. This is something I WOULD bring up to the recruiter and will most certainly be found at MEPS if not told to him. I do not know the eyesight requirements. But I do know a friend who was prior Recon who messed up one of his eye's in an accident (or so he tells me) that was allowed to continue to serve out his enlistment.    Final verdict: Don't mention previous child-asthma problems, and check with the recruiter about the eyesight thing.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Tell ya what, if I were you I wouldn't even mention the asthma thing, many children have it and outgrow it. If your eye has been corrected then it's not a factor although they will ask what surgeries you've had.|`|hexzaIGgaa	Asthma before 13 is NOT a DQ.

Its also one thing to receive help when your down and out its another thing to quit your job and sit at home collecting food stamps and welfare when your perfectly ok to work.  You say liberalism takes from the rich and gives to the poor, I say liberalism takes from the hard workers and gives to the lazy.  Thats not the America I would like to see.|`|AA11215432	You seem to be a little agitated.  Don't be angry that we don't all agree. Life is good.  If I were hungry, on the street, and you walked by with an orange, and the well meaning police officer nearby took your orange and gave it to me, I would not eat it.  This is analogous to governmet aid. It is not help.  I will accept help from anyone, but in order for it to be defined as help, it must be freely given.   Government handouts are first taken from someone else.  I will accept help from my fellow citizens, and help them.  So please, if you need help, ask me and my friends;  Not the government.  The quality will be better and we will all still be free.|`|nCxraniDaa	No.  I will not take any handouts.  I worked hard and I saved my money for times like this.  I did not spend on frivolous things but only necessities.  The only debt I have now is my mortgage.  That "stimulus" check they sent out last year is still sitting in my savings account.  I refuse to spend it.  I'm the only person that should be looking out for my well being.|`|Ka7UjuMbaa	Of course. I've got 100g in the bank...but have decided to take welfare.<br>  <br>  In fact...my family owns a good part of Memphis...<br>  <br>  But id rather take the handout...be lazy...wait for the economy to fail..<br>  move to my families estate...let the government fail<br>  <br>  And be a part of the White Republicans...who replace the government.|`|6asLzGV7aa	Yes they'll line up in droves to accept these benefits.

Bravo yourself.|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	Anyone who believes they have no alternatives is either lazy or stupid.  I have been down on my luck on many occasions.  I have been broke, sick, single handedly raising children and with awful job choices.  And yet, I have never asked for a handout nor accepted one.  We need to recreate the mentality that anything is possible. Equal opportunity does not guarantee equal results.  You have to put some work into it, not just hold your hand out.|`|LUQX6Wglaa	How about this - I will not take any "help" if I do not have to give any "help".<br>  <br>  Help - in this situation - would be taxes.<br>  <br>  I will pay taxes for necessary items, ie Military, Roads, Schools, ect...<br>  <br>  I will not stand by and watch as my tax dollars fund a "Moral Hazard".<br>  <br>  If you don't know what a "Moral Hazard" is, then look it up.|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	which Anti Socialist Conservative are you talking about?|`|OnWmqs4paa	They may try and reclaim the money that has been stolen from them...|`|DebIsZViaa	I'm going to correct your grammar, to practice for the SATs and to get back at liberals who answer questions with snooty remarks on spelling.  Make sure your pronoun usage agrees, so it should be 'down on your luck.'  <br>  <br>  And I agree with you.  I would hope that conservatives don't take government handouts; however, if a person is absolutely destitute and completely impoverished, then I would not fault him or her by taking welfare benefits.  I don't think many people would advocate for the abolition of welfare in it's entirety, but it should not be expanded beyond what is necessary for human survival.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	"Help from the . . Government?"<br>  No such thing but if they've taken all we have it makes sense to get some back if you can. Only a moon-bat or dedicated communist would call that "help."<br>  In 100% of cases where "few to no alternatives (are) available," it's BECAUSE of government. Such conditions do not exist in nature. They have to be CAUSED by force.|`|eb66409c880bce00f4bc5114e17ab3e2aa	I would take no help from the Government.  I started working when i was 11 years old to help get my family off welfare.  We got off of it and never went back.  <br>  <br>  Even if I lost everything right now, I would not even think of putting my family on welfare or accepting anything from the government.  Doing so empowers the government to control your life.  While the unemployment rate is going up (and will continue to do so...thanks Congress.) I would have no problem getting a job to earn money because I am not picky about what i do.  <br>  <br>  If it earns the money, i'll make it happen.  If it involves the Government, they can kiss my ***.|`|k5WdChc7aa	If the government becomes Socialist like it seems to be, we won't have any choice since everything we do that is productive will be immediately taken away by the government and redistributed to everyone.|`|uspTM9cuaa	Most likely. I understand that people who were paying their mortgage are now going to stop paying it so nobama will pay it for them, like all the free loaders he's throwing money at. This encourages irresponsible behavior.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	All I want back is the money this corrupt government took from me in the form of taxes.|`|fBvhkalFaa	Of course they will.  After all, it is just THEIR damn tax money coming back to them.|`|CvFajKPUaa	I know of 2 people who refused to cash checks that they got from government programs after being severely injured on the job because both of them thought it was their fault and that the government owes them nothing.<br>  <br>  Also, think about the fact that the majority of taxes are paid by conservative minded people.  Getting aid from the government wouldn't be help it would just be a very small partial refund of extremely over paid taxes.<br>  <br>  I personally will never take welfare, I couldn't do it.  It would mean that I am a failure and that would be my fault.  Nobody owes me anything that I haven't earned.  That used to be and still should be the American way.  Besides, all this bail out crap won't help anyone but people like George Soros and union (organized crime) thugs.  The average worker will see nothing more than $13 a week.<br>  <br>  Socialism has never worked, not once.  All it is is taking the power and decisions away from the people who earned them and giving it to D.C. so they can waste it how they see fit.  Socialism is the exact opposite of what this country was founded on and what made it so great and still does.<br>  <br>  The more the government controls our lives the worse everything gets.  The experiment in liberalism that has taken place in the last 40 years is a prime example of why we in the US should all be fighting to stop socialism and big government control.  Its our lives and our decisions, the government needs to let use each live as we wish.  Nobody besides me knows how to best run my life.<br>  <br>  We in the US are supposed to be free, having our lives controlled by some politician isn't freedom, its oppression.

That makes the 'Big Israel' plan which considers to add 6 more countries to the kingdom.<br>  <br>  Israel can't even stand against Palestinians with bare hands so certainly will need the help of USA here.

CNDdRFR2aa	To be a pilot you have to go through the four year officer training program, via Academy, ROTC or OTS/OCS (Officer Training School/Officer Candidate School). Within the training there is basic for the officers. I'm not sure about OTS/OCS, but at the Academy (I'm talking specifically Air Force but may be the same), the summer between senior year of HS and freshman year of college they put you through BCT or Basic Cadet Training. They also give you an extensive basic called Plebe or Doolie year where throughout your whole freshman year they treat you bad but not as bad as BCT.<br>  <br>  Air Force ROTC they do the 5 weeks between sophomore and junior year in college, and they don't have the plebe/doolie year. I've heard for army ROTC it's between junior and senior year of college.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, yes they do have to go through basic. The only differance is, in enlisted basic they teach you how to be a follower. In officer basic they teach you how to be both a follower AND a leader which is a lot tougher. If you do ROTC you have that 2 or 3 years of ROTC classes (assuming you signed up freshman year) to learn stuff before you get sent to basic. However at the Academy, unless you were in Army Cadets, Civil Air Patrol, Sea Cadets, etc. they basically throw you to the wolves.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't provide much on OTS/OCS, the military websites always work.|`|0pXBYo4paa	No, you need an officer commission through one of these sources.<br>  <br>  Officer Candidate School (This may require you to attend basic first)<br>  <br>  A Military Academy (i.e. West Point, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy)<br>  <br>  ROTC<br>  <br>  The exception is the Army, where Warrant Officers fly helicoptors.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Cops in general make good military members. If you poll a civilian police department you will find that many have served in the military and that many of them continue to serve in a reserve component capacity. <br>  <br>  The reason law enforcement officers make good service members is that being a law enforcement officer means working in a paramilitary organization. They have policies and procedure that guide what they do, similar to military regulations. They have to abide by grooming standards that are similar to military standards and they train in ways that are similar to the way the military trains. When you go through a police academy you are basically treated like your in recruit training like the military, however you usually can go home at night unlike the military. There are some police academies that require you to live there while completing the training but they are very few. You have to do PT like in the military and you get punished with PT like you are in the military. While most police academies will never be as hard as military basic training they are very similar.<br>  <br>  Some departments operate very closely to military regiments requiring the officers to actually form up prior to starting the shift for roll call and uniform inspection.|`|bc31594d662102e5c53e9da54ca5195baa	Not because he is/was a cop.<br>  <br>  The military is not a police unit and it's job is not policing.

Beyond the guilt of living a lifetime of having killed someone through your actions while intoxicated are meaningless. How long in jail will make that onus go away?|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Depends on the circumstances, the state and if other charges were brought up. As a minor you'd automatically get either a DWAI or DUI and MIC (Minor in consumption of alcohol).<br>  <br>  A DWAI is a lesser offense usually charged to a person who was caught driving with a blood alcohol content less than 0.1. A DUI is worse offense charged if your BAC is over 0.1. In most states if your BAC is over .20, there is an automatic jail sentance ranging from 10-days to 6 months.<br>  <br>  Assuming you were caught as a minor for DWAI. You could serve 30 days in jail. But for a first offense that is unlikely. But you would probably have to do some community service, alcohol classes, probably a MADD seminar and pay a nice fine.<br>  <br>  Your first DUI, probably the same range of penalties, only more classes, more fines and more community service. And possibly a mandatory jail sentance if your BAC was high enough.<br>  <br>  If you kill someone while driving drunk it can be prosecuted as 1 degree manslaughter and you can serve up to 15 years in jail, on top of what ever other charges bring against you.<br>  <br>  Again it totally depends on the state and the circumstances but most states are pretty similar, with some exceptions. Also if you have any prior criminal history, especially related to drugs or alcohol, then the charges are often a bit more steep and can include jail time.|`|8WEFPUDUaa	well most of the t ime is a pne word awsner......... death<br>  if u killed or hit someone u might have the guilt over u for like EVER!! if u get caught u have to pay liek a HUGE fee if ur under 18. to drink a little like maby 1 bottle then drive home wouldnt be too bad but if u drink alot then get someone to dive u and u wont ge caught|`|wg8SQQjEaa	if they got caught they would get a dui and possibly have their license suspended until they are 21.

ymNM6mmzaa	In my (non-Infantry) opinion, Infantry is the best MOS to start with in the Army.<br>  <br>  Infantry is what the Army is all about.  All the rest of us POGs live to make sure you can do your job.  If you plan on making a career of the Army, having an Infantry background will set you up for success, because you will understand what kind of support the Warfighters need.  Also, you will better be able to train your Soldiers in their Warrior tasks and drills.<br>  <br>  Plus, everything everybody else said is good, too.<br>  <br>  Or, you could look into a support MOS with Option 40.  It gives you a nice blend of skilled training, plus a good, hardcore unit.  Ask your recruiter.|`|lEaT5q06aa	every thing is a risk, combat arms is more of a risk than, say, computer maintenance specialist<br>  <br>  and there is not much in the civilian world that is equivalent<br>  <br>  but there is a lot to be learned about how to deal with the real world in 11B training<br>  <br>  risk/benefit it is all choice<br>  <br>  11B/91B  1971-1993|`|lJGnuMbbaa	the way 11b's are used it may be the best mos. the fighting today is not the same as your dads. today more personnel other than 11b are killed and wounded by road side bombs car bombs etc. terrorist do not want to face a trained infantryman so they go after his support.|`|AA11301908	The good ol' 11 bang bangs.<br>  <br>  No matter what you do its going to be scary to some extent, heck you could be a cook and your still going to issued a rifle and taught how to shoot. The military is a risk and that's just how it goes.<br>  <br>  My best advice to you on 11b...Look around at the other jobs, I'm serious on this as 11b is one of the (if not the) most common job in the army. Keep in mind that this isn't a bad thing, but there are other options for you. The reality is that once you become a 11b your more then likely going to stay that for the term of your contract.<br>  <br>  For example if you wanted to be airborn and didn't have that in your contract your chances of going to jump school are a bit slim. What I'm saying is to really put some thought into what you want to do and then make sure the option of that is put into your contract.<br>  <br>  You also should look at other MOS's for something that interests you and perhaps offers you the option for further training that you would like. Keep in mind that the skills you learn in the army can and will transfer out into the real world after your service. <br>  <br>  If you wanted to (in the future) go into the medical field, enlisting as a medic or other medical MOS is a great step towards working towards that goal. If you wanted to go into legal, firefighting, dental, animal handling...etc...There's different MOS's that you can pick that will prepare you for it.<br>  <br>  A large number of my friends enlisted into MOS's that fit into what they wanted to do in the future, and after their time in the service almost all of them went into those fields.<br>  <br>  Talking to your father isn't something I can really help you on as its different for everyone. Like I said check the different MOS and see if there's something else that appeals to you and that may make him feel better about you enlisting, but remember this...<br>  <br>  You aren't enlisting for him, you are enlisting for you. Your choices should reflect on whats best for YOU and not whats best for him.<br>  <br>  As for tips on the infantry...First and foremost start doing push-ups, sit-ups, and running now. That's going to help you in basic, second of all learn how to do what your told, at the speed your told, and how not to talk back. Again a odd bit of advice but it will save your hind end in basic.<br>  <br>  Finally forget anything you've learned about shooting, and don't run your mouth about any sort of shooting you've done in the past. Trust me on this (personal experience speaking) the army teaches you a different way of shooting, and if your talking about how good you are be prepared to start doing push-ups and face a great deal of heckling when your performance doesn't live up to what you say.<br>  <br>  The other advice I have is set aside some money, your going to want to pickup some gear that you pay for out of your own pocket. Don't get me wrong the gear that's issued works and you can function using it, but many people prefer to look to other sources to pickup items that do the job a bit better (and more comfortably). <br>  <br>  If your going 11b after you finish boot and AIT (or OSUT if you opt for 11x) you are going to want to get yourself a pair of boots other then issued. The ones issued do a wonderful job, but there are lighter and more comfortable boots that you can pickup. That is where setting aside a bit of money before hand comes in handy, granted you do get paid by the army but having some spare cash set aside for things is nice.|`|c01478a0ce464355e8ad471d5a5c87dcaa	Say exactly what you said in the e-mail. There is a danger to just living. I have outlived some of my friends who are not in the army. You have more chances of being killed by a drunk driver stateside. Also, 11-B... do some running and build up your upper body. They do a lot of physical training. Also, hope you like GA. It is fairly humid in the summer. Bug repellant is a must (about 75% deet) also, baby powder for your boots. Keeps the funky foot smell down and can prevent foot fungus. Change socks out daily (twice daily out in the field). Good luck in your career. Hopefully you are not here before I leave. I leave next year. I have been seeing a lot of young people over here. Young as in... they just turned 18 weeks prior!

You realize we do have a war going on and several brigades are there now? Maybe he's actually concentrating on that. And I seriously doubt you have enough disposable income to be paying his salary. I understand it's just a saying. But it's a stupid one. We are all taxpayers. His phone number is listed. So why don't you call his receptionist? And that's a good idea to alert the media. Get the story screwed up. Put a rape victim in the public spotlight. That will fix everything.<br>  And I find it strange you could even say any of this. In my 12 years, even an accusation of rape is thoroughly investigated etc. I've never seen some elabrate "cover up".  Nobody wants to be the guy hammered for not reporting it up. So your story itself sounds fishy. She could have gone to the IG or any number of victims advocacy places that are set up. And if someone isn't forthcoming about something that happened to them or reporting offenses that were perpetrated against them you can't blame the system. Hell I've seen two men who were discharged after being falsely accused of rape. Because even when aquitted it stays on your record that you were investigated for 6-8 years. So they lost security clearances and in turn their careers over lies. So yeah, story sounds quite half baked. Because the Army actually likes to hammer rapists so we can campaign that we are doing something for victims. Not the other way around. So if this is her new "teams" way of doing business, she was better off solo or requesting a trade.

The traders and hedge funds for example help to trade and buffer against excessive fluctuations in the market prices.<br>  <br>  Short sellers are also not doing anything wrong as clearly they have to cover their short sell eventually and they are the ones that break a falling market. Short sellers also help to bring the markets back to equilibrium, if not then we would have excessive bullishness and that would be deadly.<br>  <br>  A trader knows the market more better than a politician or economist. They know it's partly psychology and can gauge the fallacy of the multiplier argument. It would be clear that the multiplier effect does not work in an environment of low confidence, because people who do manage to receive money are too scared to put it back into the economy.<br>  <br>  It's the battlers that wanted to borrow and mortgage themselves to the hilt.

For one thing, you're not going to be able to do that without sounding like a dope. Just make clear statements in good English that make your points in a logical order. Claim nothing that's not exactly what you can back up with solid evidence. (What you guess or figger, doesn't count.) Then have someone who doesn't know the details read it over and explain it back to you. The parts they get wrong or can't understand clearly are the parts that need work. There is just no way for a web site or program or anything else to instruct you. You may, though, want to find a legal dictionary on line so help you check the exact meaning in law of any terms, so that you don't say something you don't mean or can't back up. A judge is going to have a better feeling about a plain speech argument than about someone trying to sound like a lawyer and not pulling it off.
uvWH4Ioyaa	The best thing you can do is talk to a lawyer who is experienced with criminal prosecutions in your jurisdiction. But if you go it alone, you should get in touch with the prosecutor first before you go to the courthouse. If you show up at the courthouse, they will not know what to do with you since you do not have a scheduled hearing.  Do not confuse them. Ask the prosecutor how you can clear this up. He or she may be able to schedule a time to meet with you at the Court. Oftentimes if you make an effort to clear this up, the "failure to appear" will disappear. You may then plead "no contest" or "guilty" to the underlying offense and pay a small fine. You may also want to fight the charge. It was kind of stupid for the cops to waste their time giving you a citation when they could have been engaged in more important business. You are not public enemy number one.

QdzecSwdaa	I have first hand experience with how the AF treats you compared to the Army/Marines/Navy.  I have traveled/been TDY with/been deployed with all three branches where I worked closely with everyone of them, and I have seen first hand the differences between each.<br>  <br>  Stateside we typically do USSOCOM directed exercises with all the other branches, basically a big war game.  Every time I have done one of these the other branches have ALWAYS been living in the field in tents, crapping in the ground, showering with baby wipes ect......mind you this is in areas like 30 minutes from huge towns.  We on the other hand on downtown in a hotel, rental cars ect.....is there really a need for them to live in the field, even on days that no ops are going on they can't do anything but hang out in the field.  i am all about living in shitty condition when you HAVE TO, i have done it along side the army during real world ops, but when it does not have to happen, the army does it anyway.<br>  <br>  Over all they get treated way worse than us, for whatever reason.  Every army base I have been to SUCKS, I ALWAYS have to go to army bases for stuff, and they just blow.  <br>  Another thing i noticed is the army is really really really salty toward the AF, not sure why.  I have gone to different units on Army bases, for legitimate work reasons, and they just act like we are the worse things in the world.  Aside from the time I came back from a weekend smelling like beer and hung over, and they had been in the field all weekend, they don't have a reason to be like that aside from being jealous.|`|CNDdRFR2aa	I've always thought that the AF had the lower of the death rates. Also, the aerospace jobs they offer are incredible. You could be a pilot, astronautical worker, aerospace engineer, and a bunch of other things. Just look at the Air Force Academy, half of them get under grad flight training and they were in the top 10 one year for best engineering school in the country.|`|f153f5c587854a64f0b19f95ee388282aa	To Mob:<br>  <br>  That same setup for flying a plane and all....yeah, that is the standard for EVERY branch to fly aircraft, not just the Air Force. A very small percentage of the Air Force actually pilots an aircraft.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	because they want to work with airplanes and dont like ships(naval aviation)|`|N5ncEyI0aa	In the Army, you are just a puppet. For example you're with 1 million soldiers charging against the enemy and no one cares about you,you are just a soldeier in millions they wouldn't care if you died. In the Navy, you can get shot down by a plane or anti-ship fire so easily and you don't have anywhere to escape! However, in the Air Force, everyone cares about you! Especially if you are a pilot. To be in the army you just need to pass basic training but to be a pilot you have to score at least a 1200 on your SAT and then 4 year bachelor degree in aredynamic engineering as well as applied science or math and then basic then pilot school then it's still not clear you will fly a plane but if you do you are only one in a few hundreds so everyone cares about you and if your in the air you can just drop bombs and kill any ground troops or sea troops.|`|2sBQaR2waa	My experience, the AF offers a better quality of life, opportunity to travel, and great educational benefits.

YupMCYHlaa	The Republicans have a deliberate strategy not to cooperate with Democrats, and -especially- a Democratic president who can claim credit for solving a problem.  <br>  <br>  The Republicans are only thinking of how they can get back into control, and that will be a lot easier if they can blame Obama for all the trouble.  So why would they want to help solve the problem when if it gets worse they can blame Obama?|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	First of all...if you knew anything you'd know that this problem was long coming since beforwe the bush admin .

So the democrats are at a minimum more than 50% responsible for the mess we're in.<br>  <br>  Everyone agrees that the crises we're in started with in the banking sector.  Democrats forced banks to lend to people who were not capable of paying back loans.  They over-regulated the banks.<br>  <br>  Bush was a President, a position which does not have the authority to control the budget or make laws.  Obama was in the Senate, he was one of the people who were in a position to cause the damage.  He is now a President.  He can no longer write laws and control the budget.  <br>  <br>  So, the sane crowd acknowledges that both sides have had a part in this mess.  The insane, non-logical (i.e. stupid) crowd thinks republicans created this mess.  That means the republicans must have used a ventriloquist technique to magically make the democrats do what they did for the past two years (the two years where things really went to hell).<br>  <br>  So we get through all of this, and yet still, it is you who denies that democrats have anything to do with it.  I see republicans answering here.  Notice they all acknowledge some fault and agree it was shared.  Notice too that democrats answering say it was all the fault of the republicans.  So I ask you, who is doing the denying?|`|2w4Otk8vaa	Oh dear, well lets think about why we got screwed as deeply as we are, keep in mind the liberals had control of congress for the 2 years before barack was elected, and it really came crashing then, when Barnie Frank forced the low interest rates. <br>  But if you think we can spend our way out of a recession your crazy|`|7HdgMaOnaa	instead of pointing fingers let's figure out a solution to earning more money for the country let's drop a million pounds of bombs on afganistan killing all women children and men.

AA11056021	Those people who purchased homes beyond their means and those who got them the financial credit to do so..|`|XKhNw221aa	the people. the government isn't to blame, because we are a capitalist country, meaning the people are the one's responsible for the economy. that said, we main reason we're here is because the people borrowed to much and expected nothing but good things to happen. thousands of people went into the real estate business, they got a loan, bought a fixer upper, fixed it, and thought they would make a good profit, paying back the loan and the interest to. but when no one bought, they couldn't pay back loans or barely could. since this left them broke they couldn't spend money, which is what makes the economy go, which means employers had to lay off people in order to make profit. but that meant even less people could spend money. So now people don't have jobs, have massive debt, and are royally screwed. So it's the peoples fault.

AA10246871	A lot of it depends on who your executor/executrix is. If it's an attorney, then yes, there is usually a reading of the will. The people present are usually just those who are named in the will itself.  If it's a friend or family member, it's usually less formal.<br>  <br>  Wills are registered with Probate Court. Those who receive something may or may not receive a copy of the will itself. Sometimes, they are only told what they are getting.<br>  <br>  I used to be my mother's executrix. When she gave me medical power of attorney, I requested she find another executrix. Of her siblings, she has the most money stashed away because she owns real estate. If my brother were still alive, I wouldn't mind, because he'd know everything I do is honest. However, I was worried about people crawling out of the woodwork and saying, "She let her mother die so she could get her hands on that money." (Her medical power of attorney includes DNR papers, and she's very serious about that--so am I, because it is her wish.) Accordingly, she made my aunt, her younger sister, her executrix. I know everything in her will, just as I know everything in my father's will. I just don't want to have to hear, 20 years down the road, that I let my mother die by not allowing her to be resuscitated because I was eager to get my hands on something. Technically, since my brother died, everything *could* go to me anyway. But she has told me explicitly which things she wants going where, and who gets what money. She's been wise in writing her will. At first reading, it looks like everything is mine anyway, other than some money going to various people. She has, however, given me a list of who gets what. Since I get everything, I can then just give people the things she wants them to have. For example, she buys a new car every few years. I will inherit the car, and then give it to the person who is supposed to get it. She knows I wouldn't go against her wishes.<br>  <br>  As for strangers, or extended family who aren't privy to what is written in the will, they can apply to the courts for a copy.<br>  <br>  What is most prevalent today is not the skanky looking nephews standing by the fireplace, smoking cigarettes from the silver cigarette box from Morocco while the harried-looking attorney reads the will. It's the will going to Probate, close family getting copies, and everyone else having to apply for a copy if they think they need one.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Normal procedure is the will is registered with probate court.

8207ee7a6b82ec38c948d336e393f122aa	I have always tried to be "racially sensitive" although I'm sure I screw up sometimes, for which I am truly sorry. Everybody screws up once in a while.<br>  <br>  Racism vis a vis race in the current political spectrum is that we who have tried for so long to stop that b.s. with which we were blasted while we were growing up are now being skewered by those of races other than Caucasian for ANYTHING they deem to be in any way racist. We are also lambasted by our children who will not tolerate it - even from their parents. At least we taught them properly.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, if someone is of a race other than Caucasian they now feel as if they have a free ride when it comes to blasting us Caucasians. I have  NEVER seen so much hatred and class/race division here as I am seeing now. If you dare disagree with the President, you are automatically a racist in some peoples minds.<br>  <br>  Sorry - I don't subscribe to that belief and I'm sick of having it flung at me like so much sh!t. I am NOT a racist. But if this crap keeps up I just might become one. It's easy to generalize. Much tougher to admit you're not always right and must open yourself to new ideas.<br>  <br>  Caucasians DO NOT have "The Race Card" cornered.

d76068f7391307fe2b165054f8c1d86faa	The welfare system is not perfect by a long shot. Perhaps you are on to something that might work. But as far as the cost - welfare system is a drop in bucket when looking at how much of deficient is now. People are having a hard time now, and that goes for college educated people to street people. In this country we shun people that don't fit the so called - "norm" and that can't help matters either.  Welfare has been generational for decades. And most programs require that you are looking for work/job and you have to prove that also to receive any benefits. Some states differ I know. But as a Christian nation - why is it wrong to help people that are in need?  We blow up countries and  then go back in and rebuild them. Go figure the ideology of that mess!|`|I8M5kw5Saa	That would be fine with me but I think we should do away with welfare anyway and it should only be for the elderly and handicap.And maybe for a short period like 1-2 months at the most.All of these unplanned pregnancies only started happening since we have had welfare for all that want it.If your daughter goes out and get preg guess what moms and dads you just have another face to feed so I guess you better keep a better eye on your kids and this goes for the father of the baby too,its called taking care of your own.|`|ADqaMWTdaa	No offense but you have to be kidding. This Government is in the Business of of rewarding States for their increase in welfare participants. More taxpayer support for people who could care less about how many kids they have. For those who need the help with welfare and generally need the short term help my apologies but for those who take advantage of the program and could care less where the money is coming from as long as it keeps coming shame on you!!|`|xhSsby6Taa	i don't think i want to live in a country where the gov't dictates the number of kids you can have. a better solution would be limitations on the length of time a person can receive welfare.|`|I8tlXfIcaa	YEA RITE<br>  HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED HOW CAN THEY BY NEW CARS OR A BATCH FOR CRACK WITHOUT IT|`|uFTO5rs8aa	I wish they could.  There's no reason why a single mother with no or a low paying job needs to be having 4,5,6,7,8+ kids.<br>  <br>  I think that people who are accepting welfare funds for kids should be required to sign a document saying they won't have any more kids or else they will lose their benefits, but at the same time that hurts the children too, so it's hard to do something that punishes the mother without punishing the kids.<br>  <br>  There really should be an overpopulation tax on families (run by a single parent OR a married parents) who have more than say 8 kids.  I think 6 is excessive but, why would anyone even want 8 kids.
e205d688e231b13af75443c794fc1564aa	More than likely yes but it depends on what part of Korea.  Some parts of Korea are seriously off-limits to dependents.

pcHp7Dgkaa	I don't know about New Zealand - NZ and Australia are totally separate countries (like USA/Canada) and are separated by over 2250km of sea: what's true for one could be the opposite in the other.<br>  <br>  Australia needs secondary school teachers, but phys ed teachers are a dime a dozen here: we mainly need science, math and manual arts teachers. If you're qualified to teach phys ed plus one or more of those, that's fine, but phys ed alone may not be enough.<br>  <br>  Some states may require you to do a short course to familiarise you with Australian teaching methods but as a general rule, a four degree including at least one year of pre-service teacher education will be sufficient for registration. The states vary in their requirements for experience: the least that is required is 45 days of supervised classroom supervision during your training though in most cases you will need at least 1 year of teaching experience.<br>  <br>  Queensland and Western Australia are offering state government sponsorship to some secondary teachers but employer sponsorship is not available from any of the state education departments (who control all public schooling). Private schools have the pick of the locally trained teachers so sponsorship is most unlikely from that sector.<br>  <br>  For further information, see:<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/asri/occupations/t/teacher-secondary-school-teacher-2413-11.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/asri/occupations/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/pdf/migration-program.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a>|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	I dont have any experience of immigrating to those countries (I moved from NZ to Canada) but here are the webpages that you can read and find out if you qualify.<br>  <br>  NZ details<br>  <a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportunities/opportunities/teaching/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportu...</a><br>  this is what you need to do to be able to teach in NZ<br>  there are several links off this page that you must read<br>  <a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportunities/opportunities/teaching/profile.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportu...</a><br>  teaching profile of a PE teacher who moved from the USA to NZ - for your interest<br>  <a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportunities/opportunities/teaching/qualifications.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportu...</a><br>  qualifications required for NZ<br>  <a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportunities/opportunities/teaching/registrationrequirements.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigration.govt.nz/nzopportu...</a><br>  teacher registration requirements for NZ<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/Administration/employmentfactsheets/06_Education/Education.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigration.govt.nz/Administr...</a><br>  <br>  Right now, New Zealand is looking for qualified teachers who can inspire their students and ignite a passion for learning.

I am a police cadet and yes there is a difference and no there's not a difference. I go on ride alongs almost every Saturday. I have rode with many female officers and deputies. One officer told me that most female officers a more rude/ strict when encountering suspects or on car stops. When i ride with them they are very very nice. But suddenly when we do a car stop their attitudes change a little bit.. more serious i would say. Another reason is because physically they are not as strong, but i have seen them take people down before. That is party why the are a little meaner... especially the skinny ones.. But its not about being strong, tall, big, or whatever. Its about having self confidence. That is pretty rediculis about the tickets thought.<br>  <br>  When i ride with the females they usually pull people over when they go 14 MPH over.. However they do right more tickets then males. Not all females are bad/ strict.. i know one officer who doesnt do anything really. She only does stuff when she gets called to do it. She doesnt do car stops or suspicious person stops.

c07v7O80aa	Any subpoena is an order to appear at the court to testify, or to testify and produce tangible evidence, or to produce tangible evidence, or to appear somewhere and make a deposition, or to produce some evidence and give it to someone as instructed. <br>  <br>  Federal civil subpoenas are issued by the attorneys on each side. They make a motion to the United States court asking for authority to issue subpoenas for particular evidence or for persons to appear or be deposed, etc. An attorney signs it, but it carries the authority of the court. <br>  <br>  There are many other types of administrative subpoenas issued by different federal agencies. What they instruct someone to do depends on the agency and its rules.

qQ5YaAzYaa	she's screwed. She should not have reported a rape knowing that it may risk a man's career.|`|jthpq6Egaa	From experience with rape victims in the military (I was a Unit Victim Advocate), they rarely get transfered from the base.  If anything, the perpetrator is transfered to a separate unit while the investigation and trial are underway.  Additionally, a military Protective Order is given to the perpetrator to avoid any contact with the victim or they will suffer severe consequences.  And this is only in cases where the victims make this an unrestricted report (therefore, an investigation is initiated).  If the victim makes it a restricted report, military law enforcement/the command is not made aware of the rape (therefore, no investigation).  In a restricted report, the victim is taken care of medically and emotionally.  In either case though, a rape kit is conducted.<br>  <br>  Rapes are not taken lightly in the military.  Leaders risk their career for ignoring substantiated/unsubstantiated cases of rape.  If your sister was truly wronged, she needs to initiate an (congressional) IG complaint.  The IG will take the necessary steps to investigate your sister's case and punish those who failed to do their job.  Which is why I find it very difficult to believe that your congressperson didn't help...<br>  <br>  Mind you, a key piece of evidence is the rape kit.  When a person is raped, there are tell-tale signs of the rape due to the bruising and lacerations that occur, which differ greatly from consented sexual intercourse.<br>  <br>  So...there is nothing your sister can do to get an immediate transfer.  My recommendation, along with initiating an IG complaint if she was wronged, is for her to contact her branch manager and have her branch manager PCS her.  Mind you, your sister (if single) must have been at her current duty station for at least a year before a branch manager would consider a PCS.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	There's no telling what happened.  For them to say it didn't happen seems fairly indicative that there must have been some pretty convincing evidence.

l4WEwTWwaa	America wanted to lessen Japanese control of the Pacific sea. In order to do so they knew they had to take the island of Iwo Jima.

We lock up our own rifles upon command, prior to going to bed.  In the field is a different story.  There, you better not get caught without  your rifle.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Yes, they do indeed recite the creed in unison, while lying flat, at the position of attention, in the rack, shortly after light's out, if the DI on duty so chooses it to be done.  Just like in the movie, without the rifle.  Even if you don't recite the creed, you are in the position of attention until given the command to relax (I won't give the exact command used here.  For that, you'll need to go to boot camp.  I don't want to give everything away here.  We have to have some secrets).|`|l4WEwTWwaa	No we don't chant it for fun.

3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Nope, everything is tied to whan your schooling starts.
AA11476855	Actually depends on the company you are applying with.

Most private businesses that is all dependent on their policy for that stuff.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No they just go in the trash|`|1KGXts5Daa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  In most instances, any position which requires one to submit a full set of their fingerprints in order to work (whether paid or volunteer) results in those fingerprints being sent to the FBI headquarters and entered into their permanent database.  (I know for a fact that mine have been sent there at least a dozen times)<br>  <br>  Ideally, from the stance of law enforcement, the FBI database - known as IAFIS, ("Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System") - would contain the fingerprints of every person in the US.  (I believe that at last count they had the fingerprints of about 60 million people)<br>  <br>  -----<br>  (From the FBI website): <br>  "IAFIS is a national fingerprint and criminal history system maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division."<br>  <br>  "Fingerprints are acquired related to a background check for employment, licensing, and other non-criminal justice purposes where authorized by federal and state law and in compliance with appropriate regulations.  Like criminal fingerprints, civil fingerprints are processed by local, state or other federal agencies prior to being submitted to the IAFIS for processing."<br>  -----<br>  <br>  So, if you were fingerprinted* for a job which required you to be - regardless of whether or not you eventually obtained the position you applied for - you can bet that your fingerprints are in the national database.<br>  <br>  *(prints obtained of all fingers and thumbs individually - rolled; and sets of all fingers of each hand together - pressed down, as well as each thumb - pressed down.  This is sometimes referred to as a "10-set", or "10-print set")|`|oFcrglxzaa	when fingerprinted, you are subjected to a criminal background check, if you are hired, then your prints are kept on file, if not, they are destroyed
bMRYhJzhaa	rather than a meaningful lowering of payroll taxes to put more spendable income in the hands of the working classes, the vast majority is going to overpaid CEO's and big business who exported our good paying jobs to China and India and other third world countries. The U.S. in the eighties started the long decline of no longer manufacturing much of anything. We now provide services. Pumping money into services is not as useful as pumping into manufacturing. We're indebted now for more taxes to bestow gifts to companies that helped bring our economy to a grinding halt.

They are alot like SeaBees, but a little more combat oriented.<br>  Being All American in two sports makes me think you could almost make it as an AirForce CRO, Combat rescue officer, which are undoubtedly the most physically fit officers in any service. The minimum requirements are higher than most SEALs reach at their highest point, so they are absolutely crazy fit. They lead the AF Pararescuemen.

You would likely qualify for and enjoy an officer program.  If your primary goal in life is to further your education because you have civilian goals, you could look into the Guard or Reserves.  That would give you the opportunity to do some active duty training for some months while the economy sucks and then give you some education programs to use to go back to school without growing a bunch of debt.  If the economy still sucks, you can switch to the Active military from the Guard/Reserves without doing any job training.  You would be ready to go straight to your unit.  You have a lot of options and just need to figure out what exactly your dream job in the military is and then work towards that.  Good luck.

ivsKcwwvaa	I believe Presidential powers did increase substantially until the 70's War powers act. Don't get me wrong, I'm as pro military , peace through force as they come. But it was totally out of hand. We had Presidents ordering assassinations, sending in "peace keeping" forces without congressional approval, all over the world.<br>  <br>   Eisenhower goes on camera in front of the world, denying U2 spy planes flying over Russia, just days before they produce Pilot Gary Powers and his U2 they shot down. JFK damned near ordered up Armageddon in the missile crisis, not to mention the Bay of Pigs. And Johnson. He goes on national news and categorically denies bombing in Cambodia. Of coarse the very next news segment shows the bombing.|`|lEaT5q06aa	actually, i think that it did;<br>  it is just that the amount of increase is exponential <br>  and we just notice it more, and it is closer|`|nbibIzC5aa	Great Depression.

ljG3Pakoaa	For The Mob - I think you need to grow up and back off of this kid. He is asking for help. Not a smart a@@ remark. He is young and and just needs a little guidance. For the question, you need to decide what route you really want to take. You can go to college and get a degree and depending on the type of degree you get will determine what your earning potential can be. Look at different college sites and their degree programs to see what interests you. For the military, it can do great things for you. You can learn a skill that can transfer to a civilian job plus they also will pay for school. It all depends on what you really want to do. There are great benefits to both routes.

qbGqsbtfaa	No it is not always legal.  There are many issues relating to the handling, sale and or resale of food.  You may have noted after purchasing a group of packaged products that the smaller individual containers have the statement "Not For resale". You will note that the bulk package has information that is not on the smaller packages.<br>  The smaller containers may not meet the labeling requirements for that food product, examples nutritional or allergen info.  The smaller containers are then considered to not give consumers the information they need. <br>  Also certain fresh products may require refrigeration or other specific care.  This is often monitored by a wholesale license that is beyond just the basic store license. <br>  If you have a particular product you are thinking of I would be happy to give you more specific detail.<br>  <br>  Added: The Dried mangoes would be fine in jurisdictions I'm aware of.  Sanitary handling of course; labeling material generally would need to be posted / available.

The Republicans don't have a clue either . . they only complain and stand around waiting for the country to fail. So . . it is up to the Democrats and Obama to try and fix Bush's failures. At least they care enough about the country to try . .unlike the Republicans.<br>  <br>  And, no I do not disagree with Obama . . because I feel that the Republicans got us all into this with their failed tax policies and it is going to take a LONG, LONG time to fix it . . not just a couple days. We are in this for the long haul. <br>  <br>  Remember that NO ONE not one Republican has a clue how to get this economy moving . . so to stand around and complain is foolish . . not one Republican can point to a successful way to stimulate the economy . . for eight years they failed and brought the country to the brink of economic collapse. It's their fault. Bush got us into this, so blame him if you don't like the spending.  We wouldn't need to do it if it wasn't for him.<br>  <br>  Republicans failed.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I would socialize healthcare to keep medical costs down, impose tighter financial controls to prevent the same kind of economic collapse we just experienced, and drop tax rates for companies and lower and middle class Americans to encourage hiring and consumer spending.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	I would freeze all funding on programs not meeting required accounting and reporting standards that all financial companies are supposed to be held to.

Basically anything short of military strikes against Taiwan, we consider seriously.<br>  <br>  You spend a year working 70-80 hours a week freezing spending wherever it's not making an obvious impact on new technology or job opportunity in America.<br>  <br>  Now comes the hard part.. You DONT hand those newly freed up funds to the top tier of the private sector. This is really hard for Washington to do. It's easy and simple to just hand the money over to the first billionaire in line under the logic that they will distribute the money fairly into the market, you know hire more people do whatever they do..<br>  <br>  You don't do that.<br>  In 1990 Clinton's economic white horse was communications.<br>  We dumped money onto anybody who could further the goal of innovative communications network. As a result a couple hundred million computers were built and put into homes, while the Internet flourished into a new media form. It was basically a technology revolution.<br>  <br>  I say we go back to that same well.<br>  Except this time instead of communications.. It's renewable energy. You have a strategy to reprocess nuclear waste? Boom your on the list. You can broker a national deal with the builder's association for solar paint? Zap yes, go for it.<br>  <br>  The country is primed and ready to jump on this energy revolution. Now is a point in history where you can tie that service back into every industry, from banking, to brick-laying.<br>  And the innovators need to be the guys who make the big pay-days. You don't dump the money onto a beast like GE and hope they suddenly run business different than they have for 75 years. You push the agenda out to young talent - new business's who are hungry for the cash - but also for the sweet taste of success.<br>  <br>  We need new Bill Gates archetypes being created!<br>  Not relying on the ones we all ready have. That's a consistent pattern during a goldrush.. <br>  <br>  The national deficit is important.<br>  But it is secondary to creating an overall common motivation.<br>  <br>  And here is the other thing.. If you are successful - and you do ignite a movement of innovation and new business. Inevitably that bubble too will burst. Nature of the beast - and not something to be afraid of.

Even without the racial undertones, it's making light of a situation that left a woman permanently mamed. She's still in critical condition for heavens sakes! People say that Bush has been compared to a monkey but I don't recall him ever being compared to a real live monkey that had to be killed. There were multiple assasination plots against Obama before he was even elected so this is a sensitive issue. It's just in bad taste.|`|CPJ9jDfgaa	You have to separate obama from his policies.  Noone hates Obama the man, his policies however are wrong for this country and those are easy to hate.<br>  See you are the one bringing up the race card.  Why is it if a black person isn't liked, the person who doesn't like them is a racist.  Maybe they don't like the "black" person because he's just a jerk.|`|6aogL4LBaa	i think the cartoon was funny -- unfortunately, it was also very telling of the soon to be realized results of Obama's idiotic spending bill.  if you have a job, you'll be lucky to have one when we have to start paying for this piece of crap.  thanks Mr. President!!!|`|FYH2xl6Naa	I don't think they hate Obama. <br>  Your classifing a very wide range of newscasters, journalists, viewers, ect.<br>  <br>  p.s<br>  Really, why are you bringing up race?<br>  and what is the main question about?<br>  Hate? Race? or A Cartoon?|`|iy2amkZPaa	Why do liberals keep bringing up race.  Fox realizes they are the only ones being fair and balanced so after Obama was put in office they decided to give the majority of Americans a place to go for the real story.|`|eb66409c880bce00f4bc5114e17ab3e2aa	you've already been pwned by the answers here.  <br>  <br>  And no, everyone doesn't hate Bush....they only do in your narrow little mind.<br>  <br>  EDIT *<br>  <br>  LoL...I think we hurt his feelings.

Why Did CNN and MSNBC hate Mcain sooo much?|`|FaEoNy5Kaa	It's as obvious as the nose on my face that Fox is a right-wing media outlet. Just like NBC and ABC are left-leaning. I don't care what they think of Obama. O'Reily/Kilmeade and all those other ppl shouldn't matter to thinking human beings. Reading books, VARIOUS newspapers and coming to my OWN conclusions gives me my view of the world. <br>  <br>  When you let these ppl change your convictions-then they have WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much power of you! I actually agree with the sentiment of the cartoon-that the stimulus bill needs to be abolished-it's a stinker!<br>  <br>  Personally-I think my fellow AA's (African Americans) need to start to actively ignore racism when it rears its head. If we continue to acknowledge this foolishness-it will always come back. It's like rewarding the bad behavior of a child by yelling at them. It's pointless. Simply stop reading the Post. And find out who actively contributes to the paper and stop patronizing their biz. Or, to be even more evolved- & I know this is crazy, but follow me: turn the page (literally) and forget it!

If Obama is true to his current word, his promise of a puppy should be broken and I hope their little liberal hearts are broken. That would be far less intrusive than the tax system treats me.
hTFalwX6aa	YES<br>  <br>  That way they know they'll have company.|`|G6yyceAxaa	orange suits are for county jails. prison wear jeans and shirt.  And I really don't think they should go to jail.  it was dumb, the torture thing, but I think they were really drunk with power.  basically they were doing whatever they wanted, and nobody could stop them. but actually putting a former president or vice president in prison is really a low blow for everyone in the US.  it basically sends the message that we will elected criminals, and it makes the countries that have dictators look good.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	no, I was pretty happy on 1/20/2009 just watching his helicopter disappear out of sight. Seeing them in orange jumpsuits would be mixed. Seeing justice served has a very appealing side but jailing a former president would only add to the disgrace he has brought down on top of that office.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	I am already a happy person, but seeing justice of that sort would certainly add to my happiness and belief in justice and accountability in the U.S.|`|w8lwOcG4aa	It's a good start.<br>  Maybe Cheney can be renditioned to Syria where he can get the full meal deal while we're at it.|`|0E5XIo9aaa	As an American who believes in the traditional American values I would not like to see Cheney and Bush in orange jumpsuits I want to see those two cowards in army fatigues serving their country One got five deferrents while the other ducked actual service by hiding in the Texas Air National Guard. Oh well there were no VietCong that got  pass Waco so I guess that made us safe|`|AA11765933	I was waiting for someone to ask this question.  Why in the world did we invade Iraq?

I would hope that most people would come to the aid of someone in need, regardless of political affiliation.<br>  <<Democrat|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Of course.  I have quite a few friends who have different political beliefs than me.  If any of them asked me for a ride to the polls on election day, I'd be more than happy to help them out--knowing that their vote would be opposite of mine.  They would do the same for me.|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	Of course. Politics comes after humanity.<br>  And just because "some people" would not is your reason for not aligning with a political party? Your free to align how ever you like, and Independent is fine if that's how you feel. But the above example is lacking in logic.|`|ySAT3sFraa	Are you talking about the republicans that held out along parties lines, in order of preserving a "Party" ego?

It was the one without a name where the First Lieutenant led his men into the face of fire on the front lines.  Only 9 men came out alive, and the Lieutenant was shot.  He wound up losing his leg, and received a blood transfusion that carried Hepatitis B and C.  He went on to finish his education and teach for 40 years, even though he was considered 80 % disabled.  He died 51 years later of liver failure from Hepatitis C.  He was perfectly healthy, otherwise, and had no other health conditions.  That Lieutenant would be 79 now, and I am quite sure he would still be alive today if he had not been shot long ago at the age of 22.  I miss him a lot.  He was my best friend and my Father.  He died a horrible death.  I got a flag when they buried him.  I'd burn that flag if it would bring my Father back.  It wasn't worth it.  That battle wasn't worth it and that 'conflict' that wasn't a war wasn't worth it.  It didn't accomplish a thing except pain and suffering that continues to this day more than half a century later.  If it hadn't happened, my world, and my six brother's and sister's world and my 17 nieces and nephews and my 11 great nieces and nephews' world would we significantly different.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	This is not going to be a popular response but we probably should have stayed in Vietnam to finish the job.

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave up their individual liberty that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br>  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate — we can not consecrate — we can not hallow — this ground. The gullible voters, living and dead, who were bamboozled here, have consecrated it, far above the diminished power of the people to detract. The media will little note, nor long remember what we are actually doing here, nor will it ever admit what they did here. It is for us the powerful centralized government, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so fraudulently advanced. It is rather for us, the ones we have been waiting for, to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these uneducated, unskilled masses we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these useful idiots shall not have voted, however many times, in vain — that this nation, under Me, shall have a new birth of HopenchangeTM — and that government of the lobbyists, by the politically-connected, for the career politicians, shall not perish from the earth.”|`|Vu7kCPesaa	I believe they would be extremely disappointed with the fact that the current government has discarded The Constitution.|`|4zijn0cgaa	"give me liberty or give me death" comes to mind but I don`t remember anything about give me socialism or give my money to deadbeats.|`|PwR7SWbCaa	Our founders did not believe in big government...they fled from it, and founded America so they can be free.

They made tough choices with no regard for their personal benefit. In fact July 4 1776   when the 56 men signed their names to a document which could leave all of these men hanging, chose to bring freedom to America. The real story began March 5 1770, when British soldiers patrolling the streets openly threatened the citizens. As a result the Provincial Assembly was called into action and formed. Two of the most famous were John Hancock and Samuel Adams they were the two whom spoke the loudest, calling for the ejection of the British. This decision was the beginning of our freedom. They took no rewards for themselves.<br>  The true father's of our country were Hancock,  Adams and Richard Henry Lee. Not that George Washington did not do great things, but without the three men whom started it, well, Washington showed up in the end. They also followed thriugh and finished the job started. They followed through to the end. Today we and our government begin too many jobs and finish none.<br>  Today our leaders all want wealth, security and their decisions appear to be made  more with their public image and financial gain rather than the care of this country's people. Our chosen leaders live in fear. Fear of critism. <br>  I think they would be sadened at our current state. The whole purpose of this country was to start anew. New customs, freedom to choose and leave the dogmas and garbage behind when you come to America to start a new life. <br>  I think that they would also understand that when you get so many pockets of culture in one country the country will fail. Look at prior civilizations and histories.<br>  With all the freedoms they united and fought so hard for, we have had to pass too many restricting laws to protect ourselves from one another. Life really should be simple and basrd on simple rule.<br>  Our founding fathers had their hearts in the right place. They ruled and acted with honor in their thoughts, minds, actions and deeds. If we today would do so we would all be in a better place.|`|AA10202389	The constitution says Negroes are two thirds of a person. They would wonder why we subverted their work by allowing those who didn't own land to vote and when did women, native Americans and blacks get to be people. It was an elitist crowd, who didn't even think of the unwashed masses as people. Fortunately we misinterpreted their feelings about us. It takes being from the lower classes to really see the view as it takes being privileged or blind to see the mythical view. That's why I can't see it, except 'intellectually' of course. There may be a better founding father.|`|YjUYhyuDaa	Our Founding Fathers wo0uld be absolutly astonished and Horrified. The way we are using our government to bail out the financial investment companies and banks was prohibited by them and the creation of a Federal Reserve was also prohibited.

It is so refreshing to know that there are kids who care about our country.<br>  <br>  To help him in his journey, he can seek out the Constitution as well as writings from the Founding Fathers themselves.<br>  As he familiarizes himself with their writings, he will get a first hand viewpoint and be able to answer his question without basing it solely on others' opinions.<br>  <br>  For example, here is a quote from James Madison, who is considered the Framer of our Constitution as well as the author of the Bill of Rights:<br>  <br>  "We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government; upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God."<br>  — James Madison<br>  <br>  Taking a quote like this and comparing it to today's culture, it can be plainly seen that we are far from the vision and intentions our Founding Fathers had for this country.<br>  <br>  God bless you in this journey. I am citing some helpful links below.|`|X36dROOaaa	They would not even recognize it as the same country they founded.<br>  - they would weep<br>  - they'd be appalled by our lack of honesty, integrity and character - education and leadership.<br>  -|`|mp8XLuplaa	they would think it's heading towards socialism and is in complete chaos. but would be impressed in some aspects.|`|AA10675342	What history books tell us and what really happened are two VERY different things...<br>  What the news media tell us (or reports) and what really happens are two VERY different things...|`|yz1CIuvzaa	I encourage you to rent Drive Thru History DVD from the HSLDA its a great DVD with good Godly principals.|`|TpdVba4baa	They're all turning over in their graves.

vQD5IX9daa	No law covering Fedaral Income Tax? Wow, is that why so many have been jailed for not paying?<br>  <br>    The first Federal income tax was imposed (under Article I, section 8, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution) during the Civil War, then again in the 1890s, and again after the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913. Current income taxes are imposed under these constitutional provisions and various sections of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including 26 U.S.C. § 1 (imposing income tax on the taxable income of individuals, estates and trusts) and 26 U.S.C. § 11 (imposing income tax on the taxable income of corporations).<br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve System (also the Federal Reserve; informally The Fed) is the central banking system of the United States. Created in 1913 by the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, it is a quasi-public (government entity with private components) banking system[1] that comprises (1) the presidentially appointed Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C.; (2) the Federal Open Market Committee; (3) twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation acting as fiscal agents for the U.S. Treasury, each with its own nine-member board of directors; (4) numerous private U.S. member banks, which subscribe to required amounts of non-transferable stock in their regional Federal Reserve Banks; and (5) various advisory councils.

So much for saving up money for a downpayment, building up good credit by being responsible and showing that you can manage your money before making such a massive decision.

biPiIIeMaa	I can tell you that officer benefits certainly are worth it if you play your cards right. Some things you have the option of include payment for college, promotion, etc, but sometimes, you can pick one and as a consequence, that option also happens to fulfill something else. A cash bonus for example may pay for your college AND leave some leftover.<br>  <br>  But aside from the physical bonuses, like the other guy said, the morale values, brotherhood, dignity, and countless more mental traits that come with joining ANY branch will go on to help you post-service. For example, experience in the Air Force and Navy (as a pilot) can easily earn you a quick employment into an airline or air-cargo-transport company, and some employers look favorably on those that have served their country. Of course, there are a few poopheads that are so ignorant that they might hold it against you, but in that case, I would want no part in helping them become successful by the grace of a soldier's sacrifice.|`|FFqWeIX7aa	There is a lot of benefit if the country didn't have war.<br>  <br>  They just need to do maintenance things, kawad, learning, researching, eating, spying, training, etc. every day, and been paid after 1 month + get free accommodation + medical service + and paid a handsome amount of money after pension even though never been in war.<br>  <br>  But if there is war, they need to risk their own life.

Why don't taco stands have to employ a set precentage of whites? <br>  <br>  I am white and have been discriminated against because of my race. I know there are still people who are racist and there always will be but it is not the majority. If you have been discriminated against, as I have, get over it and move on. The excuse that a person fails due to being discriminated against is nothing more than a cop-out. <br>  <br>  In the New York Post cartoon they used a monkey as a compairson to the authors of the stimulus plan. I notice a lot of people asking how compairing Pelosy to a monkey is racist while others indicate that to do the same with Obama is a racist thing. Bush was portraied as a monkey thousands of times while he was in office but I never heard one person crying about it being racism. What gives? Is it not just as bad to call a white man a monkey as it is to call a black man one? I mean equality should be treeting people equally. You see many of the people who always demonize others as being racist are people who have been programed to use that response to justify their short commings. Race is not an excuse it is just a person's birthright. If you have been the victim of racism as I have get over it and prove the stereotype wrong.<br>  <br>  Change I believe in : I do not doubt what you are saying about whites hanging with whites and blacks hanging with blacks but that does not constitute racism. I prefer to hang out with people that like fishing because we have a common interest to talk about. I like hockey and racing but there are not too many blacks that share those interest. People tend to hang out with others who have a shared demographic, socio economic status, religious belief, and social up bringing. It does not mean they dislike those that are not like them, only that they feel more comfortable with and part of the group they most closely share traits with. I like many people who do not fish, watch hockey, come from a poor background in the country, or believe in God.

Supporters and critics of the administration are tripping over themselves to blame the deficit on tax cuts, the war, and a slow economy. But the fact is we have mounting deficits because George W. Bush is the most gratuitous big spender to occupy the White House since Jimmy Carter. One could say that he has become the "Mother of All Big Spenders."<br>  <br>  The new estimates show that, under Bush, total outlays will have risen $408 billion in just three years to $2.272 trillion: an enormous increase in federal spending of 22 percent. Administration officials privately admit that spending is too high. Yet they argue that deficits are appropriate in times of war and recession. So, is it true that the war on terrorism has resulted in an increase in defense spending? Yes. And, is it also true that a slow economy has meant a decreased stream of tax revenues to pay for government? Yes again.<br>  <br>  But the real truth is that national defense is far from being responsible for all of the spending increases. According to the new numbers, defense spending will have risen by about 34 percent since Bush came into office. But, at the same time, non-defense discretionary spending will have skyrocketed by almost 28 percent. **Government agencies that Republicans were calling to be abolished less than 10 years ago, such as education and labor, have enjoyed jaw-dropping spending increases under Bush of 70 percent and 65 percent respectively.**<br>  <br>  -- 2003, (R) Congress<br>  <br>  Tax Cuts:<br>  <br>  Economic Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001:<br>  <br>  Reduced lowest tax rate for 15% to 10%, and the highest from 39.6% to 35%. Obliterated a $230 BILLION surplus and created a $413 BILLION deficit. A study by the Tax Policy Center found that low- and middle-income Americans, the bottom 60% of Americans only recieved 13.7% of the tax cuts.<br>  <br>  No Child Left Behind:<br>  <br>  By the end of President Bush's first term, complaints about the administrations failure to fund the Act were shelling the White House.

Radiation is pulsing through your body right now just as it always has and always will.  I am not sure the exact level of REMs that one get from a body scan but it isn't much.<br>  <br>  Its more dangerous to walk from your car to the office than it is to get the scan.|`|OoOJr1fIaa	No, the low level ionized radiation produced by a body scanner is of a very small caliber when comparing the radiation that is produced by a hand held cell phone ,the phone wins because it usually held close to the body when being used.<br>  <br>   an x-ray producing device usually radiates a small area with a very weak stream of x-ray particles. only over exposure to these rays makes them dangerous.<br>  <br>  like that early x-ray, accidentally discovered by a German and later put to use on thousands of patients, without any lavatory testing to see if there was some danger associated with the invisible beam of highly excited electrons. unfortunately for the patients,  fluoroscopes became the norm for looking inside the human body. it was indeed a dangerous form of early x-ray that used a very strong doses that radiated the doctor as well as his patient.

So you would let the people of Iraq get murdered by the lawlessness that in sued after the "war" was over? You have no idea what your talking about other then what CNN,MSNBC,ABC tells you to think. Look at all the good we have done since we when there. New schools, no more saddam, they can vote for who they want as there president. <br>   Plus them WMD's were most likely sold to syria. if you ask me, we went in to late. I was there from 2005-2006 and most people like the fact that we got ride of saddam. Good luck and never trust the government.|`|AA12020119	Good question.<br>  <br>  We actually STARTED a sectarian war and didn't nip it in the bud,  becoming the referee's, getting blown up and stripped of our money in the process.<br>  <br>  Bush used 26 reasons over a 2 year period.

Those swell republicans wouldn't have lied to us would they?|`|ujxh8Pb2aa	Because Bush wanted to avenge his father.|`|AA11323988	You are mistaken about WMDs not being found. There was not the amounts  or types expected but they did find old chemical weapons. It was not a real big find but it did prove that intelligence was not totally wrong. People seem to forget that Iraq, under Saddam, had allowed terrorist training camps to flourish. If you remember back to the Clinton presidency there was actually an air strike conducted by the US on an empty camp. They say that they did the air raid shortly after the terrorist left the area but my belief is that it was all a show in retaliation for the Cole. <br>  <br>  Saddam had made threats against the US so if there was any question about his ability to carry out the threats then there was justification to strike him first. The attack on Pearl Harbor would have failed if the US had taken the Intell as real but they thought it was wrong.|`|3663dd3fb1f1a5eace3331afe992381baa	Ha.. well we wouldn't dare go into Saudi because they have way, way too much money invested in the US, plus, we're still borrowing billions from them (Yay Stimulus!)<br>  <br>  There are plenty of possible reasons but we'll probably never, ever know the real reason. Heck, people still don't know what actually took place that lead up to the first Gulf War and it would serve them well to do some research and find out how Saddam went from friend one day to foe the next -- while doing exactly what Bush Sr. asked him to do.<br>  <br>  End Fred subscribes to the theory I find most plausible (because there is fact in it). Saddam wanted to stop using US dollars to price fuel and switching to a Euro standard would have collapsed the US dollar.<br>  <br>  Then there is the military industrial complex side of it. A lot of people have made a lot of money from us being in Iraq. Keep in mind, the freely elected Iraqi government told us they wanted us to leave well over a year ago -- we didn't listen -- and we're still there. Meanwhile, our media tells us it's to finish training or "finish the job" or whatever line works that particular week. In fact, I had to find articles in the foreign press about the Iraqi government telling the US to leave. It was never reported here in the states.

The intelligence on the WMD's and mobile bio-weapons platforms were completely shoddy and weak. For example, the mobile bio platforms intel was taken at face value from one source, whom was described as an alcoholic no less.<br>  <br>  I think we went there under a hybrid mix of realist and liberal (not to be mistaken with liberalism used to describe the democratic party) foreign policy world views. One where we wanted to secure our interests in that part of the world (oil and for other strategic reasons) which would strengthen our place at the top in the world (a realist world view). And to help spread democracy to bring stability and free markets to the region (a liberal world view). <br>  <br>  I think they just capitalized on the opportunity 9-11 presented them and used the WMD rhetoric to gain as much domestic and global support as possible for the incursion.<br>  <br>  The blame falls on both parties, not just republicans.

gvukdlOjaa	Marriage is a civil union, not a religious one.  Some people can make it a religious one as well, but that's not a necessity.<br>  <br>  As far as gay marriage is concerned, if any dumba$$ man can marry a dumba$$ woman for any length of time, and have children from that situation that end up being raised in a broken home and grow up only to repeat the process, I don't see what the big deal is with letting gays marry.<br>  <br>  Besides, straight couples can't even stay married, with the divorce rate over 50%.  Why worry about what some gay couples are doing?<br>  <br>  Instead of worrying about real issues, such as homelessness and health care, Right-Wing Bible Thumpers like to take non-issues like gay marriage, and try and make a religious and moral issue out of it, when it's not.<br>  <br>  If anything, homosexuality is a psychological or a physiological issue, not a moral one.<br>  <br>  As long as they don't make people pass IQ tests before they're allowed to have children, then gay marriage is the least of worries in the US today.|`|VIhj7ghUaa	If conservatives are so insecure in their marriages as to feel threatened by letting other lifestyles participate, they are too pathetic to bother with.  My wife and I don't feel threatened, but then, we don't have that conservative mental disease.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	First marriage is also a legal commitment because when you divorce you have to have lawyers and the such to decide things like were the property and money will go and if there are children involved, were they will live.  You have to sign a legal document to be married called the license thus it is legal.  I beleive that if they want to be couple thats fine but it should not be called marriage because that is a union saved for a man and woman who plan to have children and live as the word of god.  It is a legal and religous issue.  So there can never be truly a division of church and state.|`|tvNkizDraa	The ones who push the religious definition of marriage being between "a man and a woman only" argument conveniently overlook the fact that the issuance of marriage licenses is a civic function, NOT a church function. Religious marriage is a ceremony. If a particular church refuses to perform the ceremony, that's their prerogative... but the church collectively should not have the right to say a marriage between two consenting adults is illegal.|`|b38a792bf2cb6a7cf64e2b3989db936eaa	I love the way we have it right now.

It is called being assertive.|`|oBe7igsaaa	--marriage by nature involves a sexual act that unites a man in a woman organically. to become 'one flesh' be fruitful and multiply is not possible in a gay relationship.<br>  -- Prohibiting homosexual marriage is not meddling in people private affairs; it is about protecting our future.<br>  -- We must strive to keep the family unit from becoming extinct and stop at noting to protect heterosexual marriage.<br>  -- Homo marriages would devalue the sanctity of marriage.|`|iy2amkZPaa	Simply no.

UVVce5hTaa	Amtrak is a government boondoggle of the highest order.  Even with the GOP in power it was burning over a billion per year...with lousy expensive service on top of it.<br>  <br>  Americans love the air even when they hate it.  Air travel can be a pain, but you usually get there quicker at a comparative price.  The best thing to do with Amtrak is abolish or privatize it...if indeed it can be run at a profit.|`|QuERBTkzaa	The $8 billion investment in a high-speed rail system could effectively modernize much of the US railroads. And in the process, modernize the very concept of traveling by train as well—an idea of travel deemed antiquated by much of the nation. The only sector in which Amtrak makes an actual operating profit on running trains is in the Northeast, where larger cities are closer together than in other parts of the nation, and the primary infrastructure has been in place for decades. <br>  <br>  Obama hopes to build upon that model by installing railroads to link cities in other parts of the nation—an effort he believes could help revitalize the Midwest. A faster rail service could relieve traffic congestion, conserve energy, prevent pollution, and offer greater accessibility for intercity travel.<br>  Railroads in places like the Midwest and California routinely operate at a loss, and survive only on government subsidies. And the idea that train travel is outdated—along with a dearth of destination options and lackluster service—is among the reasons it struggles. This $8 billion dollar overhaul, combined with an additional $1 billion scheduled for 2010, could go a long way to remedy America's railroad woes. The extensive project will also create thousands of jobs in the process. <br>  <br>  With high speed service, more destinations on the menu, and a modern image, Americans might just be willing to park their SUVs and get on the train again.|`|b38a792bf2cb6a7cf64e2b3989db936eaa	It's bunch of BS.

jGgOVd5Zaa	In the U.S. the accused has the right to face their accuser; basically that means unless he confesses you have to testify.  The good news is it sounds like you have two other witnesses and he is already in trouble on other charges.  It's possible the person who stole from you will take a plea bargain, but short of that you'll have to testify.  For something like this, it shouldn't take too long.  The prosecutor will ask you a couple questions, then the defendant's lawyer may ask you a couple questions.  Just answer honestly and directly.  For something small like this, that should be the end of it.  The jury will decide if he is guilty.  (In a more complicated trial there might be appeals and you might have to testify again.)  <br>  <br>  I've had stuff stolen from me before, but they never caught anyone.  I did have to testify before a grand jury once in a drunk driving case.  Grand juries decide if there is enough evidence to charge someone and you the defendant's lawyer doesn't get to cross examine you.  They asked me to repeat some stuff.  I kept trying to use my hands to show how the cars moved and they had to ask me to describe it without hand gestures so the court reporter could type it in.  Good luck.

There are really two types of racism, inter-personal and institutional, and as Attorney General it is appropriate that he brings up the subject.<br>  <br>  Institutional racism is evident with racial profiling by law enforcement, disproportionate sentencing guidelines for crack and powder cocaine possession and 'reverse red-lining' practices by lending institutions.  The latter is where minority neighborhoods are 'red-lined' as 'bad' and can't get a pizza delivered, but financial institutions targeted the same areas as 'good' markets for predatory lending practices.<br>  > Transcript: Help for the Homeowners? .

Most are just screaming failure because they want to complain. They didn't want him to win...for whatever reason, and they use something that people (not just saying conservatives) screwed up long before he took office and is going to take years to make better if possible. Btw he (Obama) said before he was voted in that this would take years to fix. They just want to say told you he isn't a magical n-gro (not saying all or most who oppose him do so due to his race). Which is a joke I've seen floating around awhile. They still want to say he's Islamic (which isn't even important if he actually is) they still say he's a socialist, somehow I seriously doubt that. But look at what capitalism has brought upon us. No I'm not a commie. And I know that everyone that has a problem with him isn't swayed by his race.  ALSO ABOUT SPENDING you have to put money in a product or system to make money, creating new jobs will cost a lot of money. 92% percent of people pay their mortgage on time but many will try to say that the bailout bails out worthless bums period.

You don't know about any regimes even in ancient history that already had these "updated" "modern" "future" rules for security?<br>  <br>  Why did Bush go back to ancient history of the most brutal regimes to acquire his security principles while telling us that constitutional principles much newer are outdated?

Having their people well armed is what allowed the American colonies be able to defeat the British in the Revolutionary War.<br>  <br>  From the James Madison Biographical Library page regarding winning independence from Britain:<br>  Our Founding Fathers wasted no time in attributing this victory to the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	You gotta be joking.<br>  The 20s were a horrible time. The nation was on its way to the great depression, but it was much like the early part of this century. Greed ruled. But it wasn't ordinary greed we see now. most people in cities worked for companies who owned most of the town..literally. You worked for the company, bought food from the company, bought everything, quite literally from the company and even lived in company substandard housing within company fences and weren't permitted to leave without company permission. Even children were schooled at company schools in many cases IF schools were provided at all.<br>  But that's only people who owed their souls to the company store as the saying went. The vast majority of farmers were share croppers which was a horrible way to live because most of the profits went directly to the land owners an not the people who grew the crops.<br>  The same kinds of situation was very common for miners as well. Construction workers, while many had fantastic skills there were very few, if any safety standards in place. My grandfather was an iron worker most of his life and it's a small miracle he wasn't killed and my dad often talks about the friends of my grandfather who died on the job.<br>  The 20s and that era in general was a very violent time. Violence was the culture and life was cheap. Labor was beaten down routinely for complaints and strikes.<br>  Even the game of baseball of all things was extremely violent. Players routinely sharpened spikes and part of the game strategy was to take out a 2nd baseman with your spikes. I had two grandfathers obviously and my mothers dad was a ball player and played catcher with no shin guards and no protective gear aside from a mask at all and I vividly remember his legs were all but ripped to shreds and every finger on his hands had multiple fractures.<br>  Most babies as in the 3rd world today were born at home and people who went to hospitals almost always went there to die. Nobody went to hospitals to get well. They went to die.<br>  It was normal for a company to dump their waste directly into rivers and the air? Forget it. it was so filthy in cities in some areas you could barely breath without getting sick especially in heavy industrialized areas.<br>  In Dayton, Ohio where i am from the entire town was flooded in 1913, which granted wasn't the 20s, but the flooding problem wasn't solved until the 30s when the dams and levies were finally built. The same problem plagues many, many "river towns" of the time as it still does in many places to this day except it was worse then.<br>  Finally, if you were an African American your life was even cheaper. While actual slavery was outlawed many people remained in relative slavery and the Jim Crow laws were everywhere.<br>  All in all, I'm very glad I'm not alive in the 1920s... I'm sure i could go on and on with reasons why, but this should be a good start for you.<br>  Don't let the idiots discourage you..

AA11494150	Probable cause is defined as circumstances that would lead a reasonable officer to believe a search would probably turn up something illegal. <br>  <br>  However, if the officer suspects weapons, the standard is reduced to reasonable suspicion (Terry v. Ohio). <br>  <br>  Being on campus with a backpack, absent other facts, would not be reasonable suspicion or probable cause.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No,<br>  <br>  all he needs is a reasonable suspicion. Cops will make up all kinds of excuses to do a search. Who's a judge & jury going to believe, you or a cop?|`|R9zaR2mQaa	A police officer can ASK you to let him search your backpack without probable cause.  You do not HAVE to let him.  Now, if the officer said, "give me your backpack" then checked it without your consent, he would need probable cause.<br>  <br>  Every crime has a threshold for probable cause.  There isn't really a set regulation.  Also it may completely depend on your school/state.  Sorry to be so broad.|`|c07v7O80aa	Ignore ignorant answers. Suspicion does not justify search. But you don't say what your answer was to his question. You need no justification to ask to see what's in there. If you consent, you consent.<br>  <br>  You said, "Okay," didn't you?|`|fac3afb9eafebe44a3441ec97585572eaa	They do not necessarily need it, but they can usually make something up anyways to get around it.<br>  <br>  If they want to they sure can, just don't give them a reason to and you will be fine.|`|EccBqsntaa	Only with a search warrant.<br>  <br>  I learned about our rights in December...<br>  :]|`|grTNCMb9aa	yes a police officer almost always needs probable cause , in your example it sounds a bit suspicious. so an officer should be able to search your backpacks if necessary. If it was earlier than 10:00 by maybe 2 or so hours it wouldnt be necessary. Another reason may be because somthing like a robbery happend or there was a claim that someone had some type of deadly or illegal wepon. So to answer your question yes a police officer should have a probable cause to search you and your backpack.<br>  <br>  Note: I'm baseing this on what recently happend where I was searched due to a robbery 1 and 1/2  blocks from where I was

DTSUJe2oaa	The Crime Scene Technology Certificate courses teach students to "process" crime scenes. Crime scene processing includes safeguarding the scene, locating physical and biological evidence, sketching and photographing the scene, collecting and packaging evidence and, later, testifying in court. The courses in this program are useful to police officers, detectives, crime scene technicians, criminalists and anybody interested in this popular and fascinating subject.<br>  <br>  In order to become a criminalist, applicants will need to acquire a minimum of a bachelor's degree in the physical, biological, or forensic sciences. Applicants must also complete at least 24 semester hours of either biology or chemistry, and math. The actual courses completed are more important than the degree title given to the graduate. Because scientific advances are continually unraveled at a rapid pace, continuing education classes are also required, and will need to be taken throughout your career.<br>  <br>  These are the same jobs with different names and will pay the same depending on the type of department.~
B2HUARPCaa	Bennis v. Michigan was an interesting case from 1996 that was a 5-4 decision. A wife let her husband drive her car to work. Instead, he picked up a prostitute on the way and got caught and arrested and found guilty. The car was then seized by the government because it was used in a crime- even though it wasn't his car it was his wife's. It was held that her rights were not violated. <br>  <br>  I agree with the dissenters that she did absolutely nothing wrong and got punished, which is why I think it is such an interesting case with a terrible interpretation of due process.|`|4a2c923b437f704e9782f91d4d0e3e8eaa	Adarand Constructors v.

0szdPqI0aa	Well, as long as you are able to learn what they dish out at you, and you study, you should be fine.<br>  <br>  now let me answer your questions.<br>  <br>  1) corpsman are always needed. They are not only the medical personnel for the navy, but also the marines.<br>  <br>  2) You will receive basic medical training, learn emergency medical procedures, and some other stuff the EMT;s do. and that is i believe 16 weeks. Then you may get additional field medic training to work with marine units. But over all, right after training, you will work on an aid station or battalion hospital, and maybe deploy, or you may jus stay on base. with a marine unit, you have a high chance to deploy.<br>  <br>  3) Well not too sure what TESTS you have to pass, but like high school, after you learned something you will be tested on it at corpsman school. to be able to deploy, you just got to prove that you can work, and be a corpsman.<br>  <br>  4) if you get Field medic training, and are sent to be with a Marine Fleet Marine Force, and your a male, you have a GOOD chance of seeing combat. Since your a male, you might be sent to field medic training regardless if you want to or not. and since the Marines don;t have there own medics, you will be out there in combat patching them up if your a FMF medic.<br>  <br>  5) Well for the most part, if your not a FMF medic, i heard it is really boring. You fill medical records out, give shots to people, do stitches for people here and there , etc. you will work in a hospital.<br>  I heard many corpsman like that are anti social. ( some). But it is what you make it.<br>  <br>  If your a FMF medic, then i may be difference. you will be patching up marines, train for combat with them. and still sometimes work at there battalion aid station.<br>  <br>  6) Well with your recruiters, you just demand you want to be a corpsman. never go open contract. if they are not willing, threaten to go o another recruiter. You got to go for it. tell them corpsman or nothing.<br>  <br>  7) YOu should retake the asvab, you must score high enough, or you might not have a chance to become a corpsman. the asvab is very important because is determines what jobs are open to you. if you dont score high, the only job open may be scrubbing ships.|`|9rhmeb7raa	You are going to have to wait a year.

gasquENMaa	I had to think about how your mind set is working to see it that way. I can't say I honestly agree that the law was written with that concept. Jails, prisons and incarceration are consequences for persons who won't follow rules, regulations and laws. <br>  <br>  A lot of what we do is "programmed" into us. We automatically follow the rules knowing that if caught doing otherwise is either going to cost us financially or by some form of incarceration.<br>  <br>  Picture you are driving home at 2 am. You are not inebriated nor in any hurry. You come across a 4 way stop sign. There is absolutely no one in sight. No headlights visible as far as you can see. You are reasonably sure that you are alone on the road. Do you still come to a full stop and check before going through the intersection? <br>  <br>  PS...I do. I don't want to develop a habit that might allow me to blow a stop sign when traffic MIGHT be around and I just allowed myself to "stop thinking" for that one moment. <br>  <br>  Using that same type of thought pattern, I have to agree with your thought about paying not to go to jail. But I also see it as paying taxes allows me to pursue other goals in life and keep what I have worked and saved for. <br>  <br>  Pretty much the same reason I don't break laws intentionally ( and try not to break them unintentionally either).<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you

jthpq6Egaa	Speaking in regards to security clearances, the best thing you can do is be honest with your investigators.  Do not BS them, do not hide anything from them...simply be straight and upfront.  That way, they will not be blindsided by something significant from your past.<br>  <br>  With that being said, investigators will talk to as many people as they deem necessary.  Friends, relatives, acquaintances, college/school administrators, law enforcement, past employers, you name it...  they will find out about EVERYTHING, including your "expunged" incident - just because it's gone from your civilian record it doesn't mean it's gone from law enforcement records.<br>  <br>  As long as you were honest with the investigators and have matured and exercised responsibility now that your older, your teenage indiscretions will be, for lack of a better term, overlooked.|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	For a Secret Clearance, all any of the branches do is a National Agency Check - which will reveal all of your convictions and run-ins with the law.<br>  <br>  All they do is get the report and say, "Okay, he was arrested in 1989 for smoking dope, what's on his SF-86??"  The only thing that will keep you from getting a Secret Clearance is if your SF-86 doesn't match your agency record check... as in, if you omit details.<br>  <br>  Don't sweat it.

Most of my Republican friends are upset with their party and want it to change, because they recognize that continuing along their current path will obliterate the party.  And they don't want that.

Imagine conducting trade without currency and you see what that means.  Without currency, you have to exchange value for value or barter.  You mow my lawn for me and I will babysit for you.  Currency is only paper unless it is backed by real value.<br>  <br>  There is a certain amount of value or wealth in America.  To illustrate let's say that valued is 1000.  If you print 100 dollars to represent that value, then each dollar is worth 1/10 of all the value.  If you now print 1000 dollars the overall value did not change so each dollar is now worth 1/100 of the value or you need 10 dollars to equal what 1 dollar equaled before you started printing more.  So printing more dollars only makes the value of each dollar less.  That is what is meant by inflation.<br>  <br>  Many countries have allowed inflation to get out of control. That is why in some countries, they have currency so worthless you need a wheelbarrow full just to buy a loaf of bread. <br>  <br>  In other words, the government can print more dollars but it cannot produce wealth.  The wealth is generated in the Private Sector.  <br>  <br>  *|`|C2HHfun2aa	They can and that is exactly what they are going to have to do to pay for the porkuls bill.

Instead, I have private health insurance, supposedly good, and they are a nightmare.  It's no rose garden dealing with them, even though they cost a fortune.  I certainly can't afford to go outside of network to hire "the best."  I'm stuck with their tiny list of "available" doctors who actually aren't taking any patients "currently."  <br>  <br>  Additionally, millions don't even have insurance.  I can't imagine how they survive with the outrageous, excessive costs of the "free market" health industry.  So I'd be happier with universal healthcare.  It couldn't be more excessively costly or less efficient than it is now, and let me reiterate that I supposedly have good insurance.  Really feel for people who have whatever is considered bad. People in Canada can always use the Canadian system.  If they want an outside opinion, they can pay out of pocket.  You can do that here, as well, but who can afford that?  Drastic changes need to happen in the entire industry, and I'm open to the universal option.|`|hiRYCT2Haa	The only reason Canadians buy insurance outside the country is when they travel OUTSIDE the country.

In both cases it would take about a year before you got your visa.|`|2pJfVvwcaa	This is a two step process. First you must select a country in which to get married. Usually, if you want to get married in the US with the intention of living in the US, you should obtain a US fiance visa before applying for residency in the US after having married your bf. Since you are a Canadian citizen you don't need a visa to enter the US, so it may sound simpler to marry while visiting, but if you intend to apply for residency to live in the US, doing it that way may take longer. The other option is having your bf marry you in Canada and then have him apply to bring you to the US. The problem with that option is that you may be denied entry to the US if you attempt to visit while the application is being processed. It is to your advantage that you are a Canadian citizen, I am sure you will not have a problem obtaining a fiance visa (unless your bf does not meet the requirements). The best is to contact the US Embassy in Canada and your bf should contact an immigration layer in the US to find out all about the procedure.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	A Green Card Holder cannot sponsor anyone...<br>  Only a US Citizen can do that...<br>  Getting Married doesn't change that either.

Why they choose to adhere to a laughably ridiculous religion like Islam is a mystery to me.  Inherently contradictory, they honor as a prophet a man who would be rejected as an immoral reprobate by any other religion, yet they claim him to be morally superior to the other Western prophets.  They claim that the previous books, the Tanach and New Testament are corrupt...yet never specify which parts are corrupt...and if indeed the whole of them are corrupt...why would Islam claim to be of the same tradition?|`|vPeNKLK7aa	The world's economy is in a mess.  History proves, at least once, that when capitalism is having problems, as it is now, then those problems are resolved through global warfare.  Warfare does after all create masses of employment!  The last time it was the Jewish religion that was persecuted; this time it's Islam.  However, as religions go, I would say that Islam is far better than the one that I had forced on me as a child.|`|xlvnryb3aa	its there; it exists like any other religion. And is one of the older religions. ITS not my faith but i see that the most basic principals are usually the same in all religions.Its just that you have to respect another persons religion, even if you don't like it or understand it. There is no reason why it can't coexist with other religions. but keep in mind all religions has its extremists and fanatics. And in keeping with the times treating woman as property or chattel is a thing of the past.Men must change their thinking, and move with modern times if they wish to survive and maintain themselves in the social order of society. As; for all that beheading of people, its done by people who are breaking their own religious laws. Thats why they wear masks to hide their identity and their shame. Is it not true in all faiths man shall die as he has lived, He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword. Hence; he who beheads others so shall he be beheaded. ALL of ISLAM; knows this very basic principal of religion. Man should walk forth into the light, of the modern world as men, unafraid to show their face, for the things they do.|`|sa4meK3jaa	I think the practice of chopping off their wives heads with one of those curved swords if the wife is unfaithful is a little 'over the top' to be honest with you.

jNUYkCZxaa	Magandang Umaga Sir! :) Though my brothers and sister and I were born here, my father was born in the Philippines.  We come from a long line of military family from all sides.<br>  Both my two brothers have served over 25 years in the service and my sister is a nurse in a cancer hospital in NYC and we are all very proud of them. One brother U.S. Air Force and one U.S. Army.  And lots of other family as well.

PI8VfiY1aa	It looks like you already explained it for yourself!<br>  <br>  It's exactly what it sound like. Before a bill or issue is be voted upon, it is scheduled in the agenda. But very often, some bills aren't in the agenda and because of their importance they may trump others (like the stimulus plan). <br>  <br>  "Congressional agenda" is not a formal term. It literally means the "schedule."
PI8VfiY1aa	....I keep coming across your questions....<br>  <br>  Anyway, bills can originate in from either the senate or the house, but traditionally they originate in the house of representatives, where legislation can be introduced by any member, or indirectly through a representatives constituency.  The bill goes through the rules committee, and is placed on the house calendar to be scheduled for voting. It is debated upon in the house before being voted upon. <br>  <br>  If the bill passes the house, it goes to the senate. If the senate's vote majority approves the bill, it goes to the president for signing. The president either signs the bill into law or vetos the bill. A presidential veto means that the bill goes back to congress, where it will now need a 2/3 majority to override the veto. If a 2/3 of congress votes to override the veto, the bill becomes law. Otherwise, it dies.<br>  <br>  p.s. The senate can introduce bills as well. All that needs to happen is that the presiding officer must recognize a senator(s) who is proposing a bill. If any other senator objects, the bill is put off until the next day. Otherwise, the bill is scheduled for debate and to be voted upon before it goes to the president.|`|Q4PCupuqaa	Nothing, its who's palm gets greased first.

There are the stupid! They have no idea and no chance of ever having an intelligent thought.<br>  There is the ignorant! They can be taught but only if you can keep their mouths shut and their minds open.<br>  Lastly, is the intelligent who actually think about things before saying them. <br>  Those touting garbage like this fall into the first and/or second category.

If your going into the war just so you can kill lots of people, then you need to go seek help. Killing someone is not all "Hurray" After you do it, you will feel horrible, maybe not then, but years later you will remember and feel horrible. Its the reason why you should never ask a war vet how many people they killed. Its not something they want to remember. Seriously if you think its good to join to kill people seek help.|`|KSizZYZEaa	Roll the dice if and when you go to war I would have to say depends on your aim and physics.

It is a short step from there to the public stoning of women who don't dress properly and the beheading of infidels at halftime of the soccer game.  During the period Between the election of President Obama, and the swearing in ceremony on January 20, he went to President School, where he was made aware of situations and given knowledge that he did not have previously.

Remember, Democrats didn't like it either, which is why they opened it up for discussion rather than just voting to pass it.  (They had the votes to just pass it had they wanted to.)

It’s a bad plan to begin with, but if they just took the money without any reservations then they could give up running in the next presidential election for the GOP because the far right will not support them.<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way I went to Talkingpointsmemo website and the article does not mention one republican that has taken credit for it yet.

eIhD4y8Waa	It is true,the incumbents get re-elected time after time,average longevity for a rep is over 10 years.People always complain about congressman,but it's always someone elses.Why are there only 435 representatives anyway?In 1911 they passed a bill that stated there would be 435 reps. and that is it.From 1789 until 1911 the number of reps grew proportionately to the population.At one time it was 1 rep per 40,000 people,now it is 1 rep per 500,000 to 700,000.What happened to the one person one vote principle.The ramifications of this 1911 bill limiting reps to 435 [ where ever they got that number] has had a major impact on the decreased amount of governance.I urge you to read an article and a movement to restore the 1 to thirty thousand.   thirtythousand.org.|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	Personally, i have non-voting plans for mine, but an even better plan would be if all the guns wielded by all these incumbents--with a few minor omissions--blew up in their hands.  Maybe the disruption would delay medical aid until we had to replace them with real people who don't feel we owe them anything, and actually have the welfare of the country foremost in their minds and plans. That's the only really positive method I can imagine.  Anything else is just too haphazard.

However mortgage rates were higher several years ago when many people bought their house, and they can not refinance to get the new lower rates unless the can pay back their current mortgage with the proceeds from the new mortgage.  But they can not get a new mortgage  large enough  to pay back the old one, because the value of their house has fallen in value. That is why Obama has proposed a government program to help people in this trap.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	If Obama said this then he is probably lying.

Its like they don't realize they'll be paying for them beyond their years.<br>  <br>  The interest rates could go a little lower and that's because the Fed has rates artificially deflated which makes printing all this money even more dangerously inflationary.|`|UBVDXsyuaa	Because he knows not of what he speaks, and he is fear-mongering again.|`|xhSsby6Taa	if he is saying this then he is either ignorant or a liar|`|xy7Zjsu1aa	He is an idiot.

Pat Moynihan. He complained on MSNBC that, "The segment of the country that pays for the federal government is now being governed by the people who don't pay for the federal government." Mr. O'Donnell added for good measure, "Ninety percent of the red states are welfare client states of the federal government." <br>  <br>  So our Federal Taxes kept to ourselves may be best for us and not so good for the "Red States" recieving Federal Support.<br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  WSJ.com - Opinion: The Blue-State Tax Burden* <br>  Google it.

He is trying to get us out of it, but, even with republican help, it is going to be a long, slow climb.  Everyone knows this. We are in a hell of a mess.  We got there under the administration of George W. Bush.  We are involved in two wars, thanks to him, that we cannot possibly win.  Have we learned nothing from Vietnam (and, by the way, I was there).  The Russians share a border with Afghanistan, and they could not defeat the insurgency there. (Oh, by the way, did I mention that we armed the Taliban, our current enemy, to fight against the Soviets?"<br>  We cannot win in Iraq or Afghanistan.  The sooner we realize that and withdraw, the better.  We cannot afford to spend billions of dollars there, that we need here.

Fact is, a government would eventually collapse in a pure socialist idealogy.<br>  <br>  Think about it.... someone defaulted on their mortgage and your money is paying for their mistake.<br>  <br>  We are trillions of dollars in debt and just passed a bill to spend a trillion more to try to get out of debt.  Government intervention of a free market society will only cause more damage.   The Governments job is to pass laws to protect us, not take over a private industry because there was a problem.<br>  <br>  Fact is, the Government was a big part of this problem in the first place.   Corrupt politicians and the corrupt CEO's of Fannie and Freddie led to fannie and freddie gaining over 46% of the mortgage market.  When these two firms were questioned, the corrupt polititians like Pelosi or Frank would go to work to protect their friends and heavy contributors over at Fannie and Freddie.<br>  <br>  During the Great Depression,  the government had passed laws to keep banks from getting so big... in the 90's those laws were reversed... No two companies should get so big they control almost 50% of the total United States market in ANYTHING!

LNFg5KMuaa	The problem is that there are several groups within each of those parties, so I apologize, but there is no way around a long answer, but I'll try to summarize.<br>  <br>  Groups within the Republicans:<br>  <br>  Standard Conservative=for strong action foreign policy, for free market capitalism, business before environment, for traditional family values, against gun and property regulation<br>  <br>  Classical Liberal=Same as conservative but set a different list of priorities focused on the economy<br>  <br>  Moderate Republican=for strong action foreign policy, balance between business and environment, for traditional family values, for a big federal government and federal spending to handle issues, against gun and property regulation<br>  <br>  Social Conservative=sometimes anti military, business before environment, for free market capitalism, for regulating and controlling morality in society, pro gun regulation<br>  <br>  Conservative Libertarians=disagrees with the party on a lot of issues but believes in free market capitalism and against gun and property regulation<br>  <br>  Groups within the Democrats:<br>  <br>  Bright Green environmentalists=mainly focused on getting a balance between business and environment<br>  <br>  Blue Dog Democrats(moderate/centrist)=for fiscal conservatism, for traditional family values, for strong action foreign policy, balance between business and environment, for fewer gun regulations<br>  <br>  Dark Green Environmentalist=mainly focused on environment and heavy fines and regulations on businesses to keep them from harming the environment<br>  <br>  Social Liberals=against traditional family values in public sector, heavy gun and property regulation, heavy environmental regulation, foreign policy focused on getting along with the UN and other countries, uses taxes and government programs to intervene in the economy<br>  <br>  Groups within the libertarians:<br>  <br>  Necessary evil Libertarians=believe that people should be able to take any action, without aid, restriction, or regulation, as long as it doesn't interfere with someone Else's ability to act.  They believe though that there are situations where it is a necessary evil for the government to step in, but it is extremely important that they be defined as a temporary necessary evils and not a right.<br>  <br>  Minarchist:believe in the type of society where the only government institutions are a police, courts, military, and prisons.<br>  <br>  Groups within the Green party:<br>  <br>  Bright Green environmentalists=mainly focused on getting a balance between business and environment<br>  <br>  Dark Green Environmentalist=mainly focused on environment and heavy fines and regulations on businesses to keep them from harming the environment<br>  <br>  Light Green Environmentalist=believe that environmental conservation is an individual responsibility<br>  <br>  The Constitution party is about the only party that is predominantly united, and believes in original intent: christian principles, free market, less regulation, and strong foreign policy<br>  <br>  As you can see the different groups is what causes most of the fighting that keeps things from getting done and not that there are different parties.

PwR7SWbCaa	Because Libs say they are not babies, yet they have a beating heart!..|`|YupMCYHlaa	Others have said: Because abortion is not necessarily 'baby killing'.<br>  <br>  But there's another reason.  The Republican Party has used the abortion issue to get votes from Christians. They had no intention of banning abortion or even settling the issue with a compromise  because that would have taken away a big issue for them.  With the help of a number of (corrupt) Christian leaders, the have tried to play the issue out for maximum political mileage.<br>  <br>  Finally the coalition between Christians and Republicans is breaking down. In the 2008 election, most of the candidates were afraid to get too close to the Christian right.  This allowed Mike Huckabee to carve out a niche for himself as 'The Christian Candidate' and you can see how well that worked for him.<br>  <br>  Abortions in the US went way down during Clinton's terms and came back up during Bush's terms.  So it shows that Republicans and Christian leaders would rather have MORE abortions than to let go of this issue that brings them votes, power, and big contributions.|`|WXLwYANPaa	Women don't want to be looked down upon for their immoral choices that got them pregnant and voted for Politicians who also don't want to be held to any moral standard.

It is, they claim, an "invasion of privacy." None of anyone else's business. The Supreme Court currently agrees with this. You will be happy to know that there are certain measures that state governments can take, though. They can issue mandatory counseling for a women who wants an abortion, so she knows all of her options and can be fully informed before she has the procedure. They can also have a woman wait a certain number of days before she gets her abortion to encourage her to think it through thoroughly. There are a few other actions that a state can take when it comes to abortion.<br>  <br>  You must also remember that a child is a huge liability, and some women feel that they simply can't take care of the child, they don't have the finances, they want to pursue an education, or they simply can't deal with the stress of an unwanted pregnancy. I bet it would be horrifying for a young girl to go through high school with a pregnant belly, and have everyone stare at her, judge her. Even if she gave the child up for adoption, I can only image the psychological damage. <br>  <br>  And I'm sure that there are women who just don't want another child, or don't want to "ruin" their bodies, so they have an abortion. I think that they are a very very small percentage, though. <br>  A lot of women, however, don't think of abortion as "killing unborn babies." It's just stopping the process that might have yielded a live baby to them. <br>  <br>  Maybe the secret reason behind its legality is overpopulation. *shrugs* <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ejluOCdTaa	I do not know..some people try to justify abortion by claiming it's not a "baby". <br>  <br>  Then you have the irresponsible women who get pregnant and claim they can have an abortion because it is "their" body...when they should've stayed off their backs to begin with.<br>  <br>  I am pretty sure in 100% of the cases..IF you could ask the 'baby' they are carrying if they would like to be born, or cut up into pieces and sucked out of a tube into a trash can... they would choose life.|`|WIczM4URaa	because the country is run by atheists who believe they descended from tadpoles.<br>  <br>  heck, charles darwin is now being hailed for his great DISCOVERY. wtf! it was supposed to be a THEORY but now being made out by atheists as a TRUTH discovered by darwin's imaginative mind.|`|ywOqliwKaa	Because life is not sacred to liberals.

They PUSH  THEIR morality on others..NO other person has that right !! And lastly,,the egg which is fertilized becomes a fetus,,which AT BIRTH,,when it takes its first breath,,becomes a baby !!  When ALL means of birth control is made available WITHOUT ANY restrictions,,will be the time when abortions will become reduced by 70 percent..   J"|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Because legally and scientifically they aren't babies.  They are embryo's and fetuses.  After the "age of viability" (the age in which a fetus can live outside it's mother), abortion is illegal in every state except in cases of the life or health of the mother or the fetus.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian and I used to believe that the Bible said abortion was wrong because that's what I was brought up to believe.  Imagine my surprise that the Bible says nothing about abortion being wrong (and abortions were very common in biblical times).  It DOES imply "to live" means to "to breathe" (read the hebrew version and translate) or and that a woman's life is worth more than her unborn child's life.<br>  <br>  I am a pro-choice Christian.  <a href="http://www.rcrc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcrc.org/</a><br>  <br>  Edited:<br>  <br>  You know what "that guy"?  I am totally with you.  <br>  <br>  You know what really brings down the numbers of abortions?  <br>  Sex education.  Not just "abstinence only" sex education, since we saw how well that worked with Bristol Palin.  But real education including use of contraceptions.  You want to know how much teenagers know about sex?  Go to the pregnancy section.  There are all these 14, 15, and 16 year olds asking if they are pregnant and if they can get pregnant by having sex using the "withdrawl" method.<br>  <br>  The sad thing is, it's the poor women who would suffer if they made abortion illegal.  Which means there would inevitably be more mouths to feed and more kids raised on welfare.  And who wants that?<br>  <br>  Rich women have always had access to safe abortions. <br>  <br>  There are already enough unwanted, uncared for, neglected and abused children in this world, why make that number higher?|`|AhBJT5xFaa	1. Because the unborn baby has not experienced life and does not know anything of the outside world.<br>  <br>  2.

I6dcRgD6aa	I agree. If a person doesn't like something they are welcome to offer something better. I see people who complain about everything. My husband goes to McDonald's in the morning to have coffee & there is a large group that meets. When they started complaining he said 4 words to them "like Bush did better" & they never opened up there whinning mouths again. I think most people do understand & are very happy with the stimulus package.

The Life expectancy is growing, we cant just keep on handing out money for longer and longer periods of time.<br>  <br>  I would also say that we should cut Military spending by 3% a year for the next 10 years, Sure our military is the best in the world by far, but we are not at war with China, Russia, Europe, or any major threat, we are at war with people living in caves, and hiding in simple adobes with a few pounds of explosives and some small arms. maybe a rocket launcher or two. we do not need to be spending so much... And our country will be just as safe if we sacrifice getting the latest supergun, or Missile Satellite as we would be without getting them.<br>  <br>  I would Also have it say that any Pay raises that Congresses shall receive must be voted upon by the people, and it is the popular vote that decides it.<br>  <br>  And One last thing I would include, is that we Triple the Education Budget. And Focus mainly on Teacher training, and increasing Teacher Pay. These people's ability to teach well determines the future of the country, if we neglect them, we are doomed.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	The thing is, we don't need a 1,000 page bill that is ambiguously written and frivolously spends $800 billion dollars.<br>  <br>  Their are items in the stimulus bill that were not disputed: relief for the unemployed, tax breaks for the working, and public works projects to create jobs.  Why not just leave it at that?<br>  <br>  Alternative energy, health care, upgrading government vehicles, saving Pelosi's mouse could have been bills on their own, they are not related to stimulating the economy.|`|0eFcXyZ6aa	Why don't you take the time to read just a third of the bill and then come back and tell us if you still call it a stimulus package.|`|Lv1YLHkWaa	That's true. But some of the best resources on the economy have condemned this bill. It's complciated.|`|otYOxmnuaa	When the body assigned to addressing the financial soundness of a package comes back after review and tells you it will do more harm than good in the long run, most logical people would scrap the package.<br>  <br>  That's exactly what happened with the "stimulus".  The CBO (Congressional Budget Office) looked over it and said those exact words "it will do more harm in the long run".<br>  <br>  The intelligent thing to do at that point would be to get more specific (what parts don't work?) or scrap it and start over.<br>  <br>  Historically it's clad with failure.  FDR tried deficit-financed spending and it failed miserably.  To match his participation, we'd have to spend 1.3 Trillion dollars per year -- and yet, we're set at 300 billion w/ a 5 year outlay facing down a 13 trillion dollar GDP per year.  Make sense?  I didn't think so.<br>  <br>  You're right in your assertion there's no such thing as a quick fix.  But let me offer this:  If the quick fix isn't viable, as indicated, then our objective would be aimed at the long term.  What did the CBO say about the long term?  <br>  <br>  We have to be smarter than this -- it was a spending package...nothing else.  <br>  <br>  And as for his new 75 billion dollar proposal for homeowners...he disregarded the numbers again which state even if rates were renegotiated to -2% (that's negative 2%), 40% of people would still default on their loans.  So what good does the 75 billion do?  You tell me...b/c at least 40% are going to default anyhow. <br>  <br>  You can't disregard logical assessment in exchange for feelings.  "Hope" is not synonymous with success in the real-world.<br>  <br>  I understand you might like him -- but be careful not to lump logic, reason and objectivity in the same pool as your political leaning.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  "It is crazy to expect everything in the package going to be what YOU like"<br>  <br>  Is it crazy to expect a package that the CBO analysts say will work??  <br>  <br>  It's not about WANT -- it's about necessities for success.|`|Dqk3uuwzaa	How about a plan that promotes Freedom & Liberty and rewards success and ambition.<br>  <br>  For starters, the following would be a mass improvement over the Democrat-Socialist porkulus bill:<br>  <br>  12 American Solutions for Jobs and Prosperity<br>  <br>  1.    Payroll Tax Stimulus. With a temporary new tax credit to offset 50% of the payroll tax, every small business would have more money, and all Americans would take home more of what they earn.<br>  2.    Real Middle-Income Tax Relief. Reduce the marginal tax rate of 25% down to 15%, in effect establishing a flat-rate tax of 15% for close to 9 out of 10 American workers.<br>  3.    Reduce the Business Tax Rate. Match Ireland’s rate of 12.5% to keep more jobs in America.<br>  4.    Homeowner’s Assistance. Provide tax credit incentives to responsible home buyers so they can keep their homes.<br>  5.    Control Spending So We Can Move to a Balanced Budget. This begins with eliminating congressional earmarks and wasteful pork-barrel spending.<br>  6.    No State Aid Without Protection From Fraud. Require state governments to adopt anti-fraud and anti-theft policies before giving them more money. <br>  7.    More American Energy Now. Explore for more American oil and gas and invest in affordable energy for the future, including clean coal, ethanol, nuclear power and renewable fuels.<br>  8.    Abolish Taxes on Capital Gains. Match China, Singapore and many other competitors. More investment in America means more jobs in America. <br>  9.    Protect the Rights of American Workers. We must protect a worker’s right to decide by secret ballot whether to join a union, and the worker’s right to freely negotiate. Forced unionism will kill jobs in America at a time when we can’t afford to lose them.<br>  10.    Replace Sarbanes-Oxley. This failed law is crippling entrepreneurial startups. Replace it with affordable rules that help create jobs, not destroy them.<br>  11.    Abolish the Death Tax. Americans should work for their families, not for Washington.<br>  12.    Invest in Energy and Transportation Infrastructure. This includes a new, expanded electric power grid and a 21st Century air traffic control system that will reduce delays in air travel and save passengers, employees and airlines billions of dollars per year.

One day in a completely innocent conversation, she heard a person say, " Well, that's the pot calling the kettle black!"  <br>  <br>  I was amazed when my friend took that comment as a racial slur!  (Most people know that this old saying was taken from the time when almost all cooking utensils were made of cast iron.  Pots, pans, kettles, all made from black cast iron.)  It simply means that the two people, things, or items were both very similar.  Thus, the pot calling the kettle black, both alike!  <br>  <br>  A simple colloquialism, misunderstood by my friend, almost caused a huge problem.<br>  <br>  I think it is time for all of us to take a chill pill, educate ourselves, and be willing to discuss things rather than immediately taking offense at every sentence that includes the word black, or every object ever used by a particular racial group.|`|zkzDLcznaa	Should we boycot Ford because Old henry said the only color a car needs is black?

(We have similar standard of living and labor costs.) Removing trade barriers from developing countries with sub-standard wages and environmental controls are destroying our economies.

Some industries have seen domestic decline, but there are many benefits.  The consumer gains lower priced and more available goods, trade/shipping industries receive a boost, and exporters of all sorts of goods benefit from no tariffs on their goods.  After all, Canada is our largest trade partner by far, and NAFTA opens up their huge market for tariff-free American goods.  <br>  <br>  The borrowing from China, Japan, and other nations is a whole different issue, but if we didn't have their credit available to us, our national security would be jeopardized and the current stimulus plan would be impossible.<br>  <br>  And yes, both political parties are generally supportive of these policies.

Many of the folks stuck in these homes couldn't afford them at their current depreciated value, much less the original value... even with a near zero fixed interest rate.

1KGXts5Daa	Yes, they can and most likely will be charged with murder (homicide), either first degree or second degree.<br>  <br>  Most likely (depending on circumstances and adequacy of defense) they will be convicted of involuntary manslaughter, but may be found guilty of murder or found not guilty of any criminal act.|`|5vgnrvcmaa	I'm not certain, but I think it may be manslaughter in the X degree|`|AA11313983	Muzzle awareness aside, if you pull the trigger, you're a murderer.  No such thing as an accidental discharge.|`|4CDVFjPEaa	If person A honestly but mistakenly believed the gun wasn't loaded and accidentally killed someone with it then what you have is a tragic accident. It's not a crime and it's certainly not murder.  The family of the victim may try to collect civil damages from person A but again the state most likely wouldn't prosecute this as a crime.<br>  <br>  The key here is person A honestly believed the gun wasn't loaded.  If he or she knew it was loaded or (maybe) should have known it was loaded then the possibility exists of a reckless endangerment charge, a negligent homicide charge, or an involuntary manslaughter charge but again no murder charges.  It is not murder|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	It's manslaughter, accidental deaths are manslaughter, it's a much less severe crime.<br>  <br>  In the above example, it would be difficult to prove in court that it was manslaughter.|`|btVNM1Djaa	at minimum it is manslaughter, at worst it can be argued 2 degree murder|`|GHPZlhAwaa	First, aiming a gun at someone is NEVER a joke, loaded or not.<br>  <br>  Well, any death that is an unnatural death is a homicide.  That homicide could be classified as a suicide, murder, accident, justifiable homicide.<br>  <br>  Aiming at someone and pulling the trigger of a gun could be considered reckless behavior or gross negligence and depending upon the jurisdiction, could be determined to be murder.<br>  <br>  For instance, any reasonable person understands the concept of gravity so if you fire a gun into the air, even in celebration, the bullet must come down somewhere and if it hits someone and kills them, in some jurisdictions could be deemed murder.  <br>  <br>  What people who legally own guns know is that you ALWAYS assume that a gun is loaded and chambered, so to assume anything else is reckless, and you can thus be assumed to have committed murder.<br>  <br>  Basically, it depends upon what the law in your state says that will determine the charge.<br>  <br>  whale|`|3oz4r6Nraa	That would be manslaughter, which is causing accidental death.  Murder has to be intentional.  Cases like these are not unheard of, it's stupid and negligent, but it is definitely manslaughter, not murder.|`|4TkzoZThaa	If ther is intent to joke that the gun was loaded and an individual is of reasonable intelligence enough to know that guns are dangerous...I think that meets the requirement.  At least it does in Texas.|`|Ltb0P4isaa	If there is no premeditation, malice or forethought, then no it can't be murder, you must prove all of those elements for it to be murder, more than likely manslaughter|`|vGu6bcR9aa	Manslaughter

But generally, an officer is an officer throughout the state but has limited powers outside his county and can usually not write traffic outside his city. So, an officer from anywhere, seeing something suspicious, can certainly look into it. What happens then depends on what he finds.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	In California a police officer is a police officer is a police officer.

091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	Depends on who you ask.<br>  Abe said to preserve the union. It was sold to many in the North as against slavery.<br>  <br>  To most southerners (who did not own slaves) it was more of a states rights. They saw their states as more important then the union and thus did not want to continue along the road of more and more federal control.<br>  <br>  The cultures were also very different. The south was farming in nature and the north was banking and industry<br>  <br>  Many in the South would not fight to continue slavery as MOST people in the south did not own slaves!! The average Joe in the south could not afford slaves.|`|KTM5JEkLaa	It was a dispute over states' rights vs. a strong federal government, and slavery became the primary issue of this debate.  The southern economy was dependent on slave labor and slave owners had personal money invested in their slaves, which made it a hot issue for southerners.  <br>  <br>  In all reality, the conflict had been brewing for some time and the issue of what new states would become slave states as they were brought into the union was a fiercely argued issue leading up to the Civil War.  When the federal government began to threaten to force the southern states to free the slaves, they argued it was not the role of the federal government to mandate what states did, but it was up to the individual states to make that decision.  There were some other issues, but basically the southern states felt that the federal government, which was politically controlled by parties predominant in the north, felt that their way of life was threatened and they decided to form their own nation.  Obviously, the federal government did not agree with the right of a state to secede from the union and they declared war on the Confederacy to prevent them from doing so.<br>  <br>  Anyone who says that the war was solely over slavery doesn't know what they are talking about.  The north did not mobilize the army for the purpose of freeing the slaves.  Period.  Even Abe Lincoln was unsure about whether to free the slaves or not.  He ultimately made the decision to do so in hopes of stirring up a popular rebellion among the slaves in the south towards the Confederacy.  Some southern leaders, Robert E. Lee included were actually discussing emancipating the slaves on their own to prove a point, but Lincoln beat them to it.|`|AN9HVBZoaa	The war was fought over states rights. Secession was legal at that time, but Lincoln wanted to preserve the union.<br>  <br>  Gen. Jackson and Gen. Lee were against slavery. Gen. Lee freed all his slaves (inherited from his wife) 10 years before the war began. In contrast, Gen. Grant had slaves and held at least one until after the war.|`|IWlPfk1raa	From the northern prospective preserving the Union for the South Succession from the Union to defend States rights|`|p1RELUkTaa	Republicans where treating the southern states unfair.|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	State's Rights. two words.|`|GtO2FMnTaa	Good parking spaces.|`|KnwsvnTjaa	To preserve the union.|`|AA11552348	Several different reasons for the Civil War, not just one.

The Missouri compromise was what pushed the south towards secession: Skirmishes between those in Missouri and Kansas over whether Kansas was to be a free or slave state. The federal government stepped in and declared Kansas would be free and southern states then begin to secede.|`|waGFlfRUaa	The War for Southern Independence was caused by many factors but the primary cause was the thirst for money & power by Lincoln & his Northern supporters.<br>  In 1860, Southern tariffs accounted for approximately 80 per cent of the Federal Governments' revenue. It was to insure this flow of money from the South that lincoln sacrificed the lives of 700,000 Americans.<br>  <br>  Slavery was Lincoln's scapegoat!<br>  <br>  The precursor to Southern secession in fact occurred 30 years before the hostilities of 1861-1865, In 1828 & also in 1832 Congress passed tariff legislation benefiting the Northern mercantile interest, but injuring the South's agricultural economy. Heavy protectionist tariffs gave Northern manufacturers an advantage by decreasing foreign competition, but forced the South to pay the bulk of Federal Taxes, as the South was a net exporter of raw goods * a net importer of manufactured products.<br>  <br>  While unfortunate slavery existed, the blame cannot placed solely on the South. Slavery existed in the North as well, including Delaware. Also, New England slavers from their home-ports in Massachusetts & New York brought slaves to America in the first place.<br>  <br>  With the election of Lincoln, the Northern manufacturers & bankers would have their puppet in the White House. Lincoln's election guaranteed a return to the disastrous policies & forced the South to secede.|`|ohgrMZDkaa	Because the South had seceded(spelling).|`|J74Y5LKxaa	Quite simply, to preserve the Union.

Wind power of the other hand, doesn't have those kinds of dangerous byproducts.<br>  <br>  I question the logic of argument being made that just because their have been more accidents in construction or maintenance of wind power, that wind power is suddenly more dangerous than nuclear power.  <br>  <br>  So quickly have people forgotten about the disaster of Chernobyl.|`|9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	Your article is short, short on facts.<br>  It's far safer than nuclear.  Your article looks at accidents involving workers in an industrial setting on wind turbines globally, but only counts nuclear power plants in the United States and only deaths resulting from radiation "no deaths from radiation in more than 40 years of American nuclear plant operations".  Don't tell me that because Chernobyl was in another country that things are safer because radiation does not respect borders.

Most of the Republicans of this nation are white Christians who believe that Global Warming is a myth and take little very seriously aside from the world.One thing I know that they take seriously is the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq. They believe Muslims to be evil, well here in Georgia anyways. They think that the Muslim threat must be eradicated and they are devoted to doing that rather than fixing other things. Republicans actually have the lowest literacy rates, from what I hear. They always seem to be unaware of things and one I met hadn't even heard of scar removal surgery, and when asked to recite the alphabet by my language arts teacher as a humiliation/challenge for something he'd said he missed Q, X, U, I, and W, and he went very slowly.

TyKaRKGGaa	That depends on a few things... first... do you need a clearance? If not, tell them. There's no real reason they won't let you into a job that doesn't require a clearance if you smoked some dope. Just don't do it while you're in or you'll be caught in operation golden flow.<br>  <br>  Secondly, how well can it be buried? Are your friends likely to spill the beans when some dude in a suit with a badge shows up to ask questions? How about your parents? Ever been caught by the cops? If the answer to any of those questions is yes then you might as well come clean.<br>  <br>  Third, understand what happens if you get caught. If your MOS requires a clearance above secret you likely won't get to keep your job. You'll lose your clearance and become the company **** shoveler. Or maybe a cook. Or something foul and annoying. Best case scenario, you spend your long enlistment that you went through a crap ton of training to be the commander's ***** boy/driver. Think about it.|`|KSizZYZEaa	The recruiter will tell you to not say anything, If you are done with it then no harm no fowl. If you continue to use then do not waste your time in the military as I can promise you will be found out by the military drug screening program that is not at any level a joke to be messed with! It is up to you but if the pot is in the past then let sleeping dogs go!<br>  <br>  Now i just upped my clearance and all that was asked is I have ever been treated for drug use. I was not asked if I have ever done drugs. So listen stay away from the **** and you will be good! If you do get caught using in the military you will get fired and yes you will loose your clearance and most likely any benefits that come from being in the military VA or otherwise.|`|MH41C9x8aa	No, it would be unnecessary unless you got in legal trouble for it. If there's no way they're going to find out and you're not going to smoke again, it's pointless and would do nothing but cause trouble.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	if two years ago with no uses since, there's no point, your not considered a smoker anymore, it at least won't show up in blood or urine after a month or two, so your good with tests, as long as you don't start again, no point of telling them, useless trouble.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	That could be interpreted as a drug habit rather than casual experimental usage.  I don't imagine it disqualifying you, but it may slow you down a bit.
9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	Didn't have to swim at my Basic... But when I was stationed at Ft. Irwin NTC, we took the Drown Proofing course and had to jump into the deep end of the pool with gear on, learn to femove gear, boots, and pants before drowning, then use pants as a flotation device|`|npMVWV7raa	Very few ppl come into boot camp (USMC) not knowing any basic water survival skills. When I was in boot 2 1/2 yrs ago, there was 3 that couldn't swim and one of the swim instructors said that was pitiful in a sense that those who joined the USMC better know basic water survival skills and swimming techniques. One of them I saw was treading water, started to panic and was pulled out of the water. The DI's and instructors gave him and the other 2 a lot of sh!t. That's why I tell ppl who wanna join the USMC that if they don't know how to swim, better learn how before shipping out.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	There wasn't that many that couldn't swim when I went to Navy basic training. Those that could not swim would have to keep coming back until they passed the 3rd class swim qual. There are 3 parts to it and one guy failed one part when I was there because he got kicked in the head by another recruit. The swim instructors thought he was drowning and shoved the pole at him and he grabbed it. He just had to come back the next day to do it again and he passed. Even good swimmers can actually fail the swim test because you have to swim a particular way when your taking the test. If you do it different than what they expect they start yelling at you and if they aren't satisfied with your progress they will throw you the pole and you'll have to come back and do it again. As long as you listen to what they tell you to do and don't do anything that they didn't tell you to do you will be fine. That is actually the best advice about the whole boot camp process. Do only what they tell you to do, nothing more, nothing less. Don't "think" about it. If they didn't tell you explicitedly to do something then don't do it. Sorry about ranting on there, just trying to give you a little extra insight into the training. Good luck shipmate.|`|XzStbSPnaa	I was the Chief at the pool in RTC Great lakes for 5 years and I think it was pretty high about 20%. Some inner city people don't have the opprotunity to learn how, where as rural kids seem to have the better chance of finding a lake or friend with a pool . It is actually not a natural thing for humans to DESIRE to swim. It is a social thing.|`|wnxOXBuKaa	I would hope they would have to swim at Air Force Boot Camp....incase they have to eject out over...say, I dunno the ocean or some other body of water that covers most of the Earth? <br>  <br>  I never even thought of that tho....

GqJVk2kYaa	Great benefits for education that others don't get. Two guys at my firm were Marines and had college paid for before they went to law school.  Take the discipline you have and incorporate it into civilian life.|`|93r3nCM1aa	I've seen plenty of Marines driving nice cars...and motorcycles.

That's not too shabby.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that's not true for everyone, the trick is to just spend wisely.|`|AA10079277	I don't think that "because" you are a Marine you will not have a nice car.  I think it depends on what else you do.  I think if after you get out, or before you go in, you get a college degree, that will have way more impact on your furture earnings.|`|XzStbSPnaa	It is true. The military offers a small course called TAP transition assistance program, and it is noe enough. Adjusting to a new environment is very hard. I tired it 9 years ago and came back in to active duty. I would have rather gone to Afghanistan than be in the civilian community. I'll have to try it again soon though .I'm sure it wouldn't have been an issue at the 4 year mark but after 20 years it becomes a part of your lifestyle.|`|raImBqwraa	Well, plenty of Marines drive nice cars. To begin with, Marines don't often get the stupid-a*s bonuses that all the other services do because we've never had to offer large sums of money to fill our recruiting quotas and get people to want to be in the Corps.<br>  <br>  Getting a job once you get out depends on you - the Marine Corps does nothing but strengthen a resume. Just be advised that it's no substitute for college - but luckily that's *free* for you as well once you're out.<br>  <br>  FYI - I'm going to make about 50k my first year out of the Marines, and I drive a decent used car that runs fine. I spent four years in the grunts as an 0311 and got NJP'd right before I got out so I was discharged as a terminal lance. <br>  <br>  It all depends on you.|`|66893d6cc1e077a1d43b4d59c1159c73aa	im not a marine, but i will try to help<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It really depends on your career choice if you choose to be a ground pounder then you wont have a translatable civilian job but say you go in as a pilot, or technician then youll be able to transfer your military career to that of a civilian career<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|65Q8oMvUaa	I know several Marines who got out and were making a great living.

Unless you are the most important person in the universe (and I'm sure there's no one that important cuz we are all created equal) you can't sue someone for telling you to shut up.  That's just like sending a two year old to jail because he or she didn't poo poo in his/her diapers.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	no; the court won't take you seriously.<br>  unless you're being told to shut up at work during a presentation while you're saying something important; but you can't unless you're in a situation of that nature.<br>  what were you saying?|`|KTM5JEkLaa	No.  The Constitution only prohibits the government from infringing upon your rights, not private citizens.

You'll just be wasting your time and money though.|`|Q6FkV1y0aa	No, if they can't tell you to shut up, they would be denied their freedom of speech.  They are not actually forcing you to shut up.  If this were the case you could sue for harassment, but trying to sue someone simply for telling you to shut up would be a waste of time and money and would only make you look ignorant and self-absorbed.|`|3FYwht8Uaa	Obviously, no! Because they didn't take away your freedom of speak, just told you to be quiet. Think about it.

Expect to get punched in the mouth, though... At least you can press assault charges for that.|`|chlGzFQlaa	Actually you can, Verbal Harassment. <br>  Regardless of what a person *meant*, how a person makes you feel is ultimately decided upon in the court of law, well in North America at least.

WrDGhduxaa	The framers of the Constitution knew that it would have to be changed in time.

Not on this thread!  People might want to vote for you to defend FREEDOM.  We would hope it would stop your electric shock therapy that makes you shout out how everyone who disagrees with you should take their meds.<br>  <br>  Our country is in a terrible mess now.  Maybe you're misdirected and could have done us good by telling George Bush he needed meds, when a defeated dictator in no-fly-zones made him not sleep at nights.  Surely there are anti-paranoia drugs around.  It could have spared us a great deal of expense, heartache, trouble and financial collapse.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, get to know the concept of FREEDOM.  It was hard enough for us to teach the Communists and the Third Reich about it.  We don't expect that it would be just as impossible for others claiming to be Americans.<br>  <br>  I don't know why others don't talk about the fact mentioned how terrorists, being considered very smart for finally putting America on its knees with the help of President Bush, is yet dumb enough to want to attack anything and everything but Bush even though they see the American people don't want involvement with their countries.<br>  <br>  Very interesting!|`|KcAehrrKaa	United States has weapons of mass destruction and is the only nation to infamously use them to destroy people.

Bring Ibuprofen and cough drops. <br>  <br>  You will train alongside everyone else in your unit. You pretty much become a rifleman with a nifty backpack and a cool title.

You will be busy getting all the training they get and making sure you are not a weak link.<br>  <br>  You won't get more medic training month to month so you have to talk to the senior medic and make sure you go to all available training.

Bill went on like nothing had happened, supposedly expecting the machine to come back on any minute. But it didn't, and he finished the speech anyway, just from memory.  Bill Clinton could do that.   He was very good at thinking on his feet, and he could speak extemporaneously very well.  He knew just what he wanted to say, what the main points were, and how to string them together.<br>  <br>  Bush couldn't do that.  He couldn't match the verb to the noun half the time.

I8tlXfIcaa	India<br>  www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/sw...<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  I. Overview<br>  <br>  India has the largest number of urban and rural child workers in the world.1 The Government of India acknowledges at least 17.5 million working children.2 Estimates by various organizations range from 44 million3 to over 100 million child workers.4 <br>  <br>  The exact number of child workers in India's export industry is not known. Major export industries which utilize child labor include hand-knotted carpets, gemstone polishing, brass and base metal articles, glass and glassware, footwear, textiles and silk, and fireworks. Children are also exploited as bonded laborers, particularly in the carpet industry.<br>  <br>  Other industries in India alleged to use child labor are: locks; leather; pottery; granite, mica, slate mining and quarrying; auto parts and accessories; cashew processing; coir (coconut fiber) products; iron and steel products; wood, rattan, and walnut furniture; suitcases and trunks; sports goods; garments; tile; and shrimp and seafood processing. Further research is required to determine the nature and extent of child labor in these industries, as well as their link to export markets. Some of these industries, such as pottery and locks, probably produce solely for the domestic market.<br>  <br>  II. Child Labor in Export Industries<br>  <br>  Hand-Knotted Carpets<br>  <br>  Hand-knotted carpets are exported in large quantity from India to the United States and Germany. In 1993, India exported more than $170 million worth of carpets to the United States.5 Although there are weaving centers scattered throughout India, the largest centers are located in the "carpet belt" of Uttar Pradesh. Carpets are also produced in the Jammu-Kashmir region, as well as outside Jaipur in Rajasthan.6<br>  <br>  The South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SACCS) estimates that there are approximately 300,000 children working in the industry.7 In 1992, the American Embassy in New Delhi noted that estimates of children in the carpet industry range from 300,000 to 400,000.8<br>  <br>  Children work in almost every stage of carpet-making. In a comprehensive May 1994 report on child labor in India, the International Labor Rights Education and Research Fund (ILRERF) asserts that children's tasks include sorting, knotting, cutting, washing, and dyeing.9 They also rear sheep, roll yarn into balls, string the looms, and weave and bind carpets.10 Often children begin work at six or eight years old as unpaid "apprentices."11 <br>  <br>  Child carpet weavers typically fall into four categories: unpaid children working on family looms, unpaid children working with adult family wage earners, unpaid apprentices (for approximately one year), and wage earners.12 A 1992 survey conducted for the Government of India by the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) estimated that 8 percent of the total work force in the hand-knotted carpet industry is child labor.13 A 1993 report published by the International Labor Organization estimates that the ration of adult to child workers in the carpet industry of Mirzapur-Bhadohi is 1:2.254.14 Of the 500 carpet children surveyed by the NCAER, the average daily wage was 12.20 rupees (approximately 42 cents); the survey found that wages were not promptly disbursed.15 Of16ten both adults and children are paid per square yard, which makes the weavers work very long hours. A review of current literature indicates that children work an average of six to twelve hours a day.17<br>  <br>  Most looms are located in earthen shacks or sheds scattered throughout villages. These sheds are similar to a typical lodging for a family in a rural village. Only a small percentage of carpet production actually occurs in factories (housing multiple looms). The NCAER study found that 91 percent of the children sampled lived and slept in weaving sheds, and basic amenities, such as light, ventilation, and toilets were deficient or unavailable.18 Anti-Slavery International described loom sheds as small, seldom more than twelve feet by nine feet, with very little light.19 Trenches about 3 feet deep and 21 feet wide are dug into the floor to accommodate the looms which are too high for the sheds. During the weaving process, three to six children and/or adults sit shoulder to shoulder. Usually there are one adult and two boys per loom, sitting in damp pits, which fill up with water during the monsoon season.20 <br>  <br>  Children are charged for meals, which include a few chapatis (bread), onions, and salt.21 They also suffer health-related problems. The NCAER 1993 study found that cuts and injuries were common. Over 90 percent of the children complained of swelling of lower limbs and severe pain in the joints.22 Children also came into constant contact with woolen fluff causing skin troubles including scabies and respiratory ailments. Work in ill-lit sheds impacted the eyesight of 40 percent of the children.23 Similarly|`|dzqxQmpFaa	Good luck, that sort of info wouldn't make it out of China with their media controls...

YupMCYHlaa	The Kansas Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise.  The fight over slavery had been going on since the country began.  The Missouri Compromise limited the number of new slave states, but then The Kansas Nebraska Act made it so that settlers in new territories and new states would be allowed to decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery or not.  This was called 'popular sovereignty'.<br>  <br>  The Republican Party was founded because of this act.  Which led, only a few years later, to the Republicans getting a president elected, a tall skinny fellow named Abraham Lincoln.  You might have read about him.

fSrmGhOfaa	First complaint by those who protect trespassers is the cost.<br>  <br>  Granted, it would be rather costly shipping all the illegals out of the country. However, this could be offset almost entirely by telling the countries from which they cane that we were withholding $50,000 a head from any monetary support we might have promised their country in payment of their share of the deportation costs.<br>  <br>  Granted, it would be costly to the farmers who hire illegal aliens because they would have to find other, and probably more expensive ways of pruning, irrigating, and harvesting their crops. However, rather than sending the money out of the country, they could get some technological company to come up with some machine to do the job. Can't be done? About 200 years ago, the only to pick cotten was by hand. And the only way it could be picked economically was by slaves... until some smart guy named Eli Whitney invented a machine that could do the job. Where there's a will, there's a way... and the US is good at finding ways... and the money would stay in the US.<br>  <br>  Besides, currently anybody hiring an illegal alien  can look forward to a pretty healthy fine... I think it's $10K to $20K per offense (per illegal on the payroll). I have  a friend who's a contractor. He had an illegal on his payroll. The guy got stopped at a truck scale. My buddy gathered his paperwork that showed he'd made an effort to establish the guy's citizenship... and took it with him to the scales. It turned out the guy had forged papers and lied to my buddy. My buddy avoided the fine, and the guy went to jail... at a cost to the taxpayer.<br>  <br>  And, finally, the illegals are costing us a lot of money.<br>  <a href="http://immigrationcounters.com/" rel="nofollow">http://immigrationcounters.com/</a><br>  Granted, this is a computerized projection, but it's based on actual figures.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Nobody really knows for sure, so any sources I could point you to would be just opinions.

One reason the Republicans do so well is that a large percentage of low-wage workers are not able to vote. This would lead to more of those darned social programs that Republicans hate so much.|`|ZKZxe1v5aa	theres no point, they'd be back over the fence before you knew it|`|AcFBETxAaa	A wonderful effect.

I asked a nurse and she replied that the E.R. has become a doctors office for these folks. They cant refuse them so the taxpayers pick up the bill. So yes if we deport them we would be much better off. The country needs to take care of its own not every other countries weary.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	4 million in california alone. it cost them over 4 billion a year just in health care and schooling.if they deported them,they wouldn't have the debt they do.this doesn't include the cost of courts and prisons.let alone the murder rate in this perspective area.|`|QzADftIDaa	Deporting 12 million would be a very difficult plan to implement and will also have many negative effects in the economy. <br>  <br>  first, even though the unemployment is high to replace 12 million people that are working would be a devastating to many industries like farming, restaurants and  hotels( just to name a few). One of the most expensive Expenses  industries could face is job training; for instance,  many people think that picking  apples, pears, oranges and strawberries is easy and anybody can do it but the people that do that kid of job, besides dealing with physical part they also know how to recognized the color, the size and the texture of the fruit. it takes many years of experience to recognize EFFICIENTLY a fruit that is ready than a fruit that is not.  this is just one example. In many other industries the same concept applies. Many of the jobs that the undocumented immigrants are doing are jobs that you can only learn it with experience.<br>  <br>  second, The 12 million people that are undocumented are also big consumers. If you want an example just turn your TV or radio. You will see many TV channels in Spanish. These channels are able to operate because they have many companies that advertise in these channels. You will see commercials like  Banks, Mc Donal's, Jc penny, sears, Disneyland and Universal studios (just to name a few) if the immigrants would not spend nobody would advertise in these channels so if you would get all those  12 million of immigrants deported those companies would lose many of their costumers and that will impact these companies negatively. <br>  <br>  Third, the logistics to deport 12 million people would cost a lot of money. Just think about it; 12 million people are a lot of people you will need many officers, many vehicles to transport these people and in addition how will you determine if a person is legal or illegal. <br>  <br>  Deporting all those people will cause many negative effects in our economy. yes!!!! the ilegal immigration is a problem and needs to be address. But deporting those people is not the solution. The problems that these immigrants cause is because the government, the employers and other citizens take advantage of the situation that these people are in.  The government takes advantage of these people because the taxes they collect from them   ( they government even provides these people with a numbers so these people can do theirs taxes), The employers,  take advantage of their   wages, they do not provide  health care, they abuse  many of these people; and the other citizens they abuse these people because whenever they need a nanny or a maid they use these people and pay them very low. in addition many Right conservative radio DJ and TV  anchors use these people as scape goats they blame the immigrants for every problem in the country even for gas prices.|`|024e057726e56ac8f27fea7f5379e549aa	With all the help I would love to have taking care of my 4.5 acres of land at below minimum wages, I still refuse to use illegal alien labor  to maintain it.

Totalitarian regimes or movements maintain themselves in political power by means of an official all-embracing ideology and propaganda disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that controls the state, personality cults, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of free discussion and criticism, the use of mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror tactics. The term has been applied to many states, including: the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Socialist Republic of Romania, People's Socialist Republic of Albania, Ethiopia, People's Republic of China, Democratic Kampuchea, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) [2] and Communist Czechoslovakia. Political opposition has also applied this term to the Saudi regime.

Profit existing in the capitalist business world, or millionaires existing within capitalism, is pathological deception committed by the 21 organizations spying on the population with plain clothes agents, (with covert fake names and fake backgrounds).<br>  <br>  Actual economics is the persons that are paying the business loans of companies voting at work in order to control the property they are paying for. The employees of companies are also paying the expenses of companies beyond the salary of the employees.<br>  <br>  Capitalism is the psychology of imaginary parents, false economics, and the criminal deception of employees that are paying the bills (including the stocks and bonds, or shares) of companies.|`|1amF7oNwaa	I DON'T KNOW BUT WONDER WHEN THE FAR LEFT ENTER A BILL TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS NATION TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF AMERICA.|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	<a href="http://www.marx.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch10.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marx.org/archive/mattick-paul...</a><br>  <br>  Ponzi schemes are pure Capitalism....new investors fund previous investors with the contant hope that new investors will always be found......it doesn't work unless there is a pyramid with the wide base being new investors|`|Q4PCupuqaa	Here's a link, I didn't read the whole think yet, but I know I will disagree with it when I do.<br>  <a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/621lecture05-2008.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/621lectu...</a>

Started out it was cold in all day and holding your weapon was a test of wills once it got frozen during chow. But in march it warmed up and by April and was quite pleasent. However on the last FTX (field training exercise) it was unnaturally hot and made for a long week. <br>  <br>  She should enjoy it. I think spring is a great time because the weather allows for good training. Not too much rain to make the range miserable. Tell her thanks for her commitment and have fun!|`|vQD5IX9daa	Fort Benning? It's an infantry training location, and females do not train for infantry. Females ARE assigned and work there, but as far as I know they do not train there.<br>  Weird.<br>  <br>  In the southeast she would most likely go to 'relaxin Jackson' (Fort Jackson, SC.) for her Basic training.<br>  And the earlier post was correct. Factor in the length of Basic, AIT, plus waiting in between for her AIT to begin, and she's going to be exposed to ALL the elements either way.|`|tev9SIwIaa	February at Benning may be a little chilly, but I'm guessing it's a lot better than shipping to Benning in the summer.|`|Jklpfaecaa	LOL i leave to fort benning on march 24... from what i have heard its the best time of year to go . not to hot not to cold just perfect!|`|65Q8oMvUaa	I would say April or May.

Police officers have no business dealing with people that are having mental health issues.  They grabbed you and detained you long enough for you to not commit suicide, but they did not give you the help you need.  They have hot lines for mental health problems, crisis lines.  You should look for a mental health clinic in your area whose fees are based on a sliding scale fee.  You can call the local hospital and ask them these questions about the crisis line for mental health patients and about the mental health clinic.  <br>  <br>  Make an appointment and see a doctor.  Feelings of wanting to commit suicide come from depression and they make medicine for that.  In all actuality they should have sent an ambulance and taken you to the hospital.
Dxxz5s7Vaa	If he wants to stay in OK then he needs to try for reserve or NG.  Active duty you will move around. <br>  <br>  Of course the first major hurdle will be if he can get back in.  He will need lots of medical documentation.  He has already been through MEPS so if he think he can pass then I don't see why not.  Being it was a back injury though I really doubt you will get a waiver.  All he can do is try. <br>  <br>  Do you research and you can always go talk to a recruiter with him so you know what to expect. <br>  <br>  However keep in mind reservist and NG do deploy.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	That's not likely.  It's the nature of servicemen to move around as to where ever the military needs them.  He's not going to get to be in the military and get to stay home too - it just doesn't work that way.  Recruiters may make promises that he'll stay in Okla, but they've been know to lie lie lie to get recruits.  Do you want to be a single mom?  That's pretty much going to be your reality if your husband joins back up in the military.  Want to move from base to base with your family?   That's military life.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Unless he has completely recovered from his injury, it is unlikely he will be able to serve.  He needs to speak with a recruiter.  If he goes with the Army, he may be able to get a guaranteed posting at Fort Sill, OK if he were to go into an Artillery MOS.  There are tons of artillery jobs at Sill.  Good luck.|`|IKw5lXQbaa	enlisting in the army might be easier cause they give out more waivers,your husband should think about the reserves if he wants to keep his domestic life stable.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	army national guard|`|IuJjYz6gaa	He could enlist in the Army and try to get orders to Ft Sill in his contract.  Chances are, if he wants to stay at Sill for a while, he could.  A lot of people are staying at Posts for 5 or 6 years now and longer.  Because moving them is expensive and they re-enlisted to stay at the post after their initial enlistment is up.<br>  <br>  Honestly, though, the moving part isn't that big of a deal.  It's a new adventure every time, and your family is always just a car or plane ride away.|`|boaTjRtcaa	He can go Natl. Guard which allows him to serve in his state. That is what my friend travis is doing. Also if he really wants to go Marines, tell him about Marine Reserves. I'm going Army Reserves 'til I'm 18 then going active.|`|66893d6cc1e077a1d43b4d59c1159c73aa	no it is not for you, mam   you need a CIVY job<br>  <br>  <br>  if what you are saying is what you want|`|65Q8oMvUaa	Look into the Marine Reserves.

Would be better on his body since hes been injured before. I know this cause I was and MP in the Air Force for 4 years. As for bases. They stick you where they need you, thats any military base. So dont count on staying in one place cause it wont happen. You could move to Japan like I did which was actually very awsome. But trying to have a kid and he goes to boot camp then schooling. Will be rough on you. Just wait till yall get to your first base then go at it imo. Good Luck. Hope it helps.|`|afAqlE3qaa	First off, what is his RE code on his DD-214? That will tell him if hes eligible to reenlist. If hes not sure what it means, he should go see the recruiter. Second, if his RE code allows him to reenlist, waiver or not, he would have to get a statement from the doctor, probably at MEPS, that his medical problem is no longer an issue, Third, the only way you would be able to stay home and not leave is if he joined the reserves. Fourth, I am married and in the military and it's really not bad. Free health care, many options on post, but deployments and all are something the wife and I have to deal with. If he is looking to reenlist to support his family that is a very good option, but only if both of you are strong enough. I would advise him to join, and eventually you both would end up stronger and better for it, but only if you put everything you both have into it. Ill give you a good example: everytime my wife hears another wife, mostly new ones, cry and whine because their husband is deployed or he has to go to the field, she wants to slap her.This is because she is a go getter, independent, and not new to this. If you can handle it, it is very rewarding. But, take it one step at a time. Trust me, it is not a bad life.

I agree,        there are no laws saying we have to pay taxes,  the politicians saw that it was a money making machine for them, grant it was a idea to temporary help during the wars of america, but it went out of control by greedy politicians, not all are corrupt and greedy but how do you know which are and which are not. it is time for the american people to reclaim their government, but everyone has to get involved,for instance the rangel bill introduced by a John Carder about granting immunity to those american citizens who owe penalties for not paying taxes, ever one must call their senate rs and representatives declaring their full support, it was intro ducted this passed thursday and they pass the buck to the house ways and means committee, the IRS compounds daily interest and penalties so a poor person who at the time could not pay their taxes [say] 500 dollars by the time they pay,   the penalties are a lot more than the actual taxes, so be a true american and act now by any means necessary to reclaim their rights under the american  flag, time for a change is indeed ready after all the bias liberal media told the people to vote for someone to change but it has to be by the american peoples own action beyond a election.

Medicines are tested and reformulated that when released to the public it will be beneficial for the majority of the public even though there are some risk involved.  But some of these illegal drugs are more likely to cause harm to many people who use it.      Hope this helps.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Just because it may be natural, doesn't mean, it isn't lethal|`|HUlyRTrraa	What  like Opium?

Hmmmm..... uh.... um.... I don't have an answer in a way.

We are talking hundreds of thousands of dollars of income not reported here.  I diligently report every penny on my returns, how bout y'all?  I'm really afraid of getting audited and paying penalties and these people disregarded what is pretty blatantly income and avoiding paying it for years.  What makes them above all of this?  I'm including Chris Dowd's special mortgage rate in this as well and he was a presidential candidate, no less.  I'm a Republican and in no way am I saying they are all squeaky clean, but this fiasco is an embarrassment and it surely shows how inexperienced and naive our Oval office occupant (I refuse to call him my president) is to have picked these people.  Couldn't he have used the CIA, FBI or whoever he might have at his fingertips to investigate appointees?  Isn't that part of his job to serve and protect us all and not blow it like this.  I'd laugh at it, but it's all too sad.  Osama Bin Laden must be plotting his next move with laughter and the dance of joy. We are in deep trouble indeed.  America can't afford on the job training.

The Republican Party was voted out because people were tired of all the disinformationn and disparage remarks that Rush Limbaugh has made. President Obama won the election, yet the Republican Party is trying to be the center of attention by playing the victimization card blaming the "liberal media" for their defeat. The Republicans are drowning in their own ignorance, and they're trying to drag the country down with them.    All we need now in our current economic crisis (Thanks to the Republican Party) is a pandemic, then we'll have a real "Great Depression" climate to suffer.    So Republicans better hope President Obama is the New Messiah because after 8-years of the Bush/Cheney Satanic Administration we're on fast track to hell in a hand basket.|`|4tiyMjhEaa	http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approva...  http://www.swivel.com/graphs/show/313520...  I found two separate graphs on Bush's approval ratings - both seem to agree mostly and the first one is the weighted average of several sources (FOX, CNN, Newsweek, Gallup...), so they are correct. Because the first one is a weighted average, I'll use it since it seems to be the most credible of the two.  We learn several things from this graph:    1) The reason that Bush's initial approval ratings weren't higher is because of the contested 2000 election which split the population.  2) Obama's 63% (http://www.angus-reid.com & CNN) are higher - but not that much higher, considering that it was one mandate from being a landslide.   3) Bush got the highest approval ratings ever recorded (~90%) because of 911. There was only one precedent in recent US history, and Americans regardless of political color tend to back their leaders in these situation. Bush took advantage of this to pass controversial legislation (most notably the PATRIOT act.)  4) This meant that Bush had a job to do: dismantle Al Qaida. His ratings remained high during his Afghanistan initiative, then they began to slide. At first, the Iraq war seemed like a good idea, however Bush took his eyes off the ball (the terrorists) and his advisers convinced him to promote democracy in the Middle East instead. As soon as the Americans realized that there was no exit plan and that the US invasion had strengthened Iran, his approval ratings slid again. The only time they rose was when Saddam Hussein was caught.    From the above, we can deduce that the Bush presidency would have been more successful, if he hadn't been so -badly- prepared for every major test that he faced:  He didn't use his advisers wisely and handled the press badly. For every Bush supporter, there was also someone staunchly against Bush. This is important. Pres. Obama -doesn't- divide a majority of the electorate that way. Bush wanted to be the decider, it seems like the current POTUS wants be a figure that people can gather around. Also, his press management is impressive (IMO, he would be a great salesman). Extending a hand to the Republicans like he is is actually a smart move - they can't criticize him for something they voted in favor of (you break it, you buy it). This, combined with his salesman-like abilities will help him pass the legislation he deems most necessary (as it is now he only needs to convince a couple of Republicans to get a majority).    He'll have to manage the people he appointed better than Bush managed his to get a reasonable presidency. However, if they can't work together, this may be the first sign that Obama's final approval ratings will be lower than they are now. He picked some strong egos and he may well have to replace some of them along the way.    Obama's approval ratings:  http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/oba...  Whether or not Obama slides down in the approval ratings from 63% depends on one thing: if he does the job the Americans have asked of him.     There are several things that have to happen if Obama's approval ratings are to slide:  - Obama increases the number of brigades in Afghanistan and the result is a disaster.  - Obama not only fails to do something about the US economy, but makes matter worse through failed policies. However, it's far easier to be less popular because of a war - less so with the economy, because, how are you going to prove that the president's policies are to blame?  - The withdrawal in Iraq doesn't go as planned. Or the withdrawal goes as planned, but the terrorists take advantage of the deadline.  - The health care reform fails miserably (good thing he didn't appoint Hillary Clinton to get that through, eh? XD).    Thus far, Obama has so -much- political goodwill that he would really have to handle the press terribly AND especially handle his advisers the same way Bush handled his (However he handled his advisers, he apparently didn't do it very well - IMHO, the single biggest reason that the Bush presidency didn't become the success story it could have become).    If he manages to stabilize things and pass just 2-3 of the politics he promised during the elections (health care reform, close Guantanamo, a successful Iraq withdrawal), then he's likely to be re-elected in 2012. If he passes them all (unlikely), he may end up with the highest approval ratings ever.    Please, let the man start before you anticipate his record-low approval ratings. Honestly, it's way too early to tell which way it will go. I sincerely hope that Obama succeeds, because that would force major changes through in the Republican party, but especially for the population.|`|AA12066574	If he carries on with this absurd "stimulus" proposal, it will sink like a rock.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	It will drop so low that Bush's ratings will look like the Mt. Everest Summit|`|oHrqbdydaa	He's have to kill a baby on camera for that to happen.|`|YonedWiEaa	yes it is.....without bush to blame Obama is having a hard time adjusting to ..."only one president at a time"|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	That would depend if the Democrats can objectively view their candidate.     Bush had a low rating because both the Democrats and the Republicans disapproved of his actions, well see how the Democrats do with critical objective thinking when they have power.

If it were some sort of superhuman trait (X-Men style), then the possibilities are endless. But if it was some sort of technological advancement, then you'd have to consider such limitations as supply, range, effectiveness, etc. It'd be a real mess. But, with the condition that mind control is possible, I'd think it conceivable that world domination would be possible.

So, when they "spend" more of this stuff that they never had, they're really adding to the total number of dollars in circulation. <br>  <br>  So, if the govt doubles the number of those dollars, it only means the folks who did *not* live beyond their means and saved, say, a million cash, have just had their savings reduced to $500,000 by inflation. <br>  <br>  If it's borrowed money, the debt burden reduces the dollar's value. <br>  <br>  Peter Schiff is right. People who've bought a mansion or spent a million for a bungalow are better off crashing their credit and renting at pennies on the dollar (which is, itself, worth about 2 pennies compared to the 1971 dollar) than living under a government stupid enough to think it is smarter than 300 million contributors to this crazy market.<br>  <br>  ...
t7KHxE2Iaa	Easy, a lot of those 'products' don't get 'sold'. 22% of them, in fact.    In the business world, you either reduce the supply or try to increase the demand.    In this situation, I see two ways to reduce 'supply' and one to increase 'demand'.    To reduce 'supply', we put funds and energy into preventing unplanned pregnancy, by honest, practical sex education (NOT abstinence only) in schools and increasing the availability of safe contraception. Or, we continue to allow abortions and cease demonizing the women who make that choice.    To increase demand, we could drop the restrictions on single parents and same-sex couples. With more good families able to adopt, we should be able to make a reasonable dent in the 22%.    Of course, all three methods: practical sex education and contraception, abortion, and gay/single parent adoptions, are anathema to staunch conservatives. One might be tempted to think they don't want to solve the problem at all!|`|nT0w6VIKaa	You do know you're annoying people, don't you?  lol|`|nkuYM33yaa	I think we should follow china's law and limit the number of kids allowed. just because one person is irresponsible why should 10 people pay for it.|`|de711i5Vaa	you get in trouble.

I recently read an article that is calling on Environmentalists to come clean about abortion and how they support it to control the population as a way of saving the environment. - so much for it being a females choice as it's clear it's an environmentalists choice.

On another note, do you really think abortion is a good method of birth control?  Wouldn't a condom be much cheaper?
9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	Yes, they have to pay the money back, plus penalties and interest.  There is a statute of limitations, though.  Geithner originally paid only those back taxes that the government could still go after him for, and didn't pay the earlier years because the statute of limitations had passed.  But he did end up repaying the prior years too once he was nominated for Treasury Secretary.    I know from personal experience that the IRS is generally aggressive in collecting any overdue or underpaid taxes.  If someone owes them, they should pay them or make arrangements for a payment plan.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Yes, they have to (and have) pay them, plus fines.|`|DBIKou8faa	Yes, they have to pay them plus penalties.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	I had to pay a penalty when I paid my taxes 1 day late, there was no leniency for me.

Period.|`|de711i5Vaa	They have to pay it but a lot of them are able to waive the back penalties due to their "famous names".|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	no it is not true - they still get penelties and get leins etc... which makes it all, all the more puzzling|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	of course they have to pay that money.|`|GC9Xqz3xaa	In all seriousness, they should be required to pay penalties, interest, and fines on that money and be put in prison as well.  It's simple tax evasion, which is an imprisonable offense.  The problem with these people is that they are connected politically to the people who would be in charge of putting them in jail, so they get a slap on the wrist.  It really is a case of them not going to jail because they know the right people.  Look at that guy who won survivor, he was guilty of the exact same thing as he's been in jail for several years now.|`|OLCnQkmBaa	I wish I was in Dixie away ,away in Dixie Land I'll make my stand to Live or Die in Dixie away, away, away down South in Dixie.|`|RstCnGL2aa	The IRS code states that you have three years to file for any tax refund you are entitled to. The same codes say that the IRS can come after you at any time for taxes you owe them. Therefore, you should keep all your tax returns for your whole life.    As to these politicians, they owe the tax, interest on any tax they have not paid, penalty on any tax they have failed to pay and, in some cases, jail time. The question then become one of will the IRS enforce the code and how far will they enforce it. That is the question now....will Geitner, one of the tax cheats, enforce the code on Daschele. I doubt we will see that.     One other thing....the IRS has the authority to freeze bank accounts. Don't ever cross them unless you are somehow connected to powerful figures like these people.     I like to kid around on Y/A but you wanted serious.|`|HGIuXxnRaa	Yes they do. Daschle is actually starting to pay the back taxes now that people know whats up with him.|`|C9T03pqOaa	yes they have to pay the money buy only if they are caught, however be very careful even, if you voted for obama but you are not a member of the democratic elite dont you dare to "forget" paying one single dollar. otherwise you can have a big problem and dont recieve the forgivness of mighty obama

3MM64geHaa	No it would not. It would not put money into the pockets of those who invest in the economy such as businesses. The lower 40 percent of wage earns don't pay income tax already. That could be part of the problem.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	No, here is an idea. Stop taxing production all together ( labor and capital)     A bill already in congress:  H.R. 25, Fair Tax Act of 2009    http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h25...   To promote freedom, fairness, and economic opportunity by repealing the income tax and other taxes, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, and enacting a national sales tax to be administered primarily by the States.    For those who dont know about the FairTax, a little background:  The FairTax Plan is a comprehensive proposal that replaces all federal income and payroll taxes with an integrated approach including a progressive national retail sales tax on new items only, a rebate to ensure no American pays federal taxes on spending up to the poverty level, dollar-for-dollar federal revenue replacement, and, through companion legislation, repeal of the 16th Amendment. This nonpartisan legislation (HR 25/S 1025) abolishes all federal personal, gift, estate, capital gains, alternative minimum, Social Security, Medicare, self-employment, and corporate taxes and replaces them with one simple, visible, federal retail sales tax  collected by existing state sales tax authorities. The FairTax taxes us only on what we choose to spend, not on what we earn. It does not raise any more or less revenue; it is designed to be revenue neutral. The FairTax is a fair, efficient, transparent, and intelligent solution to the frustration and inequity of our current tax system.

WrDGhduxaa	this really is a grey area, when someone is paid for sex, but it is on film and distributed for sale it is legal, but when someone is paid for sex in private and not filmed it is illegal.  The porn stars claim they are having sex for free, but being paid to have it filmed. I think that is a lie since they don't have sex with the other actors except when being filmed, not off screen.

(Remember, this is before 911) The legislation was defeated by the Republicans because of opposition from the airlines. <br>  + sent legislation to Congress to allow for better tracking of terrorist funding. It was defeated by Republicans in the Senate because of opposition from banking interests. <br>  + sent legislation to Congress to add tagents to explosives, to allow for better tracking of explosives used by terrorists. It was defeated by the Republicans because of opposition from the NRA. When Republicans couldn't prevent executive action, President Clinton: <br>  + Developed the nation's first anti-terrorism policy, and appointed first national coordinator. <br>  + Stopped cold the planned attack to blow up 12 U.S. jetliners simultaneously. <br>  + Stopped cold the planned attack to blow up UN Headquarters. <br>  + Stopped cold the planned attack to blow up FBI Headquarters. <br>  + Stopped cold the planned attack to blow up the Israeli Embassy in Washington. <br>  + Stopped cold the planned attack to blow up Boston airport. <br>  + Stopped cold the planned attack to blow up Lincoln and Holland Tunnels in NY. <br>  + Stopped cold the planned attack to blow up the George Washington Bridge. <br>  + Stopped cold the planned attack to blow up the US Embassy in Albania. <br>  + Tried to kill Osama bin Laden and disrupt Al Qaeda through preemptive strikes (efforts denounced by the G.O.P.). <br>  + Brought perpetrators of first World Trade Center bombing and CIA killings to justice. <br>  + Did not blame Bush I administration for first World Trade Center bombing even though it occurred 38 days after they had left office. Instead, worked hard, even obsessively – and successfully – to stop future terrorist attacks. <br>  Named the Hart-Rudman commission to report on nature of terrorist threats and major steps to be taken to combat terrorism. <br>  + Tripled the budget of the FBI for counterterrorism and doubled overall funding for counterterrorism. <br>  + Detected and destroyed cells of Al Qaeda in over 20 countries <br>  Created a national stockpile of drugs and vaccines including 40 million doses of smallpox vaccine. <br>  + Robert Oakley, Reagan Counterterrorism Czar says of Clinton's efforts "Overall, I give them very high marks" and "The only major criticism I have is the obsession with Osama" <br>  + Paul Bremer, Bush's Administrator of Iraq disagrees slightly with Robert Oakley saying he believed the Clinton Administration had "correctly focused on bin Laden. " <br>  + Barton Gellman of the Washington Post put it best, "By any measure available, Clinton left office having given greater priority to terrorism than any president before him" and was the "first administration to undertake a systematic anti-terrorist effort."<br>  <br>    Here, in stark contrast, is part of the Bush-Cheney anti-terrorism record before September 11, 2001: <br>  - Backed off Clinton administration's anti-terrorism efforts. <br>  Shelved the Hart-Rudman report. <br>  Appointed new anti-terrorism task force under Dick Cheney. Group did not even meet before 9/11. <br>  - Called for cuts in anti-terrorism efforts by the Department of Defense. <br>  - Gave no priority to anti-terrorism efforts by Justice Department. <br>  - Ignored warnings from Sandy Berger, Louis Freeh, George Tennant, Paul Bremer, and Richard Clarke about the urgency of terrorist threats. <br>  Halted Predator drone tracking of Osama bin Laden. <br>  - Did nothing in wake of August 6 C.I.A. report to president saying Al Qaeda attack by hijack of an airliner almost certain. <br>  - Bush – knowing about the terrorists' plans to attack in America, warned that terrorists were in flight schools in the US – took a four week vacation. <br>  By failing to order any coordination of intelligence data, missed opportunity to stop the 9/11 plot as Clinton-Gore had stopped the millennium plots. <br>  <br>  On 9/11<br>  - our Air National Defense was directed to stand down. <br>  the two fighter jets that were scrambled flew out to sea, away from Washington and New York and the attacking air liners. <br>  - After one of four airliners had crashed into the World Trade Center and 3 more airliners were still heading toward critical targets, the President continued to read "My Pet Goat" to third graders, claiming that he didn't want to scare them, and then had them gather around for his press conference to hear the dreadful news strait from the horse's mouth. <br>  - Although it was a city block away, World Trade Center buidling seven imploded just like a building scheduled for demolition. <br>  After 9/11 <br>  - Although the scene of the country's most deadly crimes, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were "cleaned up" so fast and the steel was shipped so far away (to China), that it has been impossible for investigators to learn anything about the causes of the collapse or how to avoid such disasters in the future.|`|82fb45fa8598ec9931c0af91cbac0f2eaa	Only 1 that matters the most.

My college research paper was on domestic terrorism back in '97-'98, when domestic terrorism was on a rise and the end of the millenium was coming.<br>  <br>  So that I don't go on some long tirade here, the problem is the definition of terrorism.  For example, the Tylenol scare back in '82...would you consider that terrorism?  How about criminal gangs?  Are those terrorists?  How about David Koresh?  Or were they "freedom fighters", like Timothy McVeigh?<br>  <br>  I think in a post 9/11 US, domestic terrorist acts like the one at Oklahoma City are unlikely, but there's always a possibility, especially with the economy going downhill like it is.<br>  <br>  The key factor in my research paper was the increasing gap between the rich and the poor in the US.  When I wrote my paper, the gap was already greater than the gap between the rich and the poor in Cuba before the revolution there.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  What's with the continued facination with Bill Ayers?  <br>  <br>  Yeah, Bill Ayers did some stupid things when he was young, but who doesn't?  He's apparently seen the error in his ways and as gone on to better things.<br>  <br>  I think criminal gangs in the US have done more damage, killed and wounded more people, instilled fear, and cost the US taxpayers more money than Bill Ayers or any of his associates ever did.|`|AA10382849	I guess that depends on how you define terrorism.

During the 1970s, the Weathermen bombed federal buildings and police stations. Prior to the March 6, 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, in which three members of the group were killed as a bomb was being constructed, all members of Weatherman went underground. The group then changed its name to Weather Underground.<br>  <br>  Dohrn went underground in early 1970, engaging in bombing activities. In a 1994 interview, Dohrn said that while the group carried out some bombings of buildings, it did not target people, and the group's actions were justified as a proper response to violent government actions: "We only did a couple, and they were carefully done. They involved property and were not meant to harm anybody. They were symbolic and done so that everyone would instantly recognize what was being said. It was 'armed propaganda'. Sure, it was violent, and it's hard to justify twenty years later, but it was extremely restrained and a highly appropriate response to the level of violence being rained nationally and internationally".<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dohrn was a principal signatory on the group's "Declaration of a State of War" in 1970 that formally declared "war" on the U.S. Government, and completed the group's transformation from political advocacy to violent action. Dohrn also co-wrote and published the subversive manifesto Prairie Fire in 1974, and participated in the covertly filmed Underground in 1976.<br>  <br>  Dohrn clearly stated support for Communist ideology:<br>  <br>  "We are building a communist organization to be part of the forces which build a revolutionary communist party to lead the working class to seize power and build socialism. We must further the study of Marxism-Leninism within the WUO [Weather Underground Organization]. The struggle for Marxism-Leninism is the most significant development in our recent history.  We discovered thru [sic] our own experiences what revolutionaries all over the world have found — that Marxism-Leninism is the science of revolution, the revolutionary ideology of the working class, our guide to the struggle" <br>  According to a 1974 FBI study of the group, Dohrn's article signaled a developing commitment to Marxism-Leninism that had not been clear in the groups previous statements, despite trips to Cuba by some members of the group before and after Weather Underground was formed, and contact with Vietnamese communists there."|`|5d8d66d7cbe2de3228701ad20a72a884aa	Well the evidence is overwhelming on the ones that are govt. sponsored.  The examples with some basic facts on each.  Well let's start with the past and work our way to now.  So 1979-2009.  Well Zbigniew Brzezinski (Carter's adviser) with the aid of the CIA started the what later became Al-Qaeda.  Those assets would be later used as an excuse to go into Afghanistan which would spread to Iraq and thus cause countless Iraqi deaths and over 4000 American deaths.<br>  <br>  There's Columbine.  The Feds helped the alleged "trench coat mafia" plant several hundred pounds of explosives and were responsible for a few of the students deaths.  Thus creating more gun control and govt. control of the school systems which would later acclimate them to be happy that men in black ski masks and automatic weapons is a good thing.<br>  <br>  WACO. Let's thank Janet Reno for allowing the Feds to bulldoze, set fires and kill all the innocent people in that church.  Not a compound, a church.  Men, women and children brutally killed at the hands of the state.<br>  <br>  OKC.  The building was blown out.  ATF and other govt. agencies were given warnings about not coming in to work that day.  2 more bombs were found in the building (but of course it was on the OKC news for a minute) to be later detonated in a safe area.  The damage doesn't correlate with the alleged pattern w/ a single Ryder truck w/ a fertilizer bomb.  People who survived and those that were in the area heard more than one explosion, and then there were the hundreds of Iraqi detainees that were arrested and later released thanks to Clinton.<br>  <br>  The first WTC bombings.  It was in the New York Times how the Feds trained the guy, cooked the bomb and told him to plant it.  The guy was payed $1million for the job which luckily backfired.  But of course it had it's role in passing anti-terror laws.<br>  <br>  Now there's 9/11.  The hundreds of eye witnesses explaining how they heard explosions before, and during and after the planes hit.  The free fall symmetrical collapse of 3 buildings, 2 which were hit by planes.  The overwhelming evidence of thermate explosives.  The drills in which sections of the towers were shut off from employees weeks in advance before.  The fact those alleged terrorists couldn't fly a Cessna, yet piloted commercial airliners better than some of the most seasoned vets.  Larry Silverstein saying how WTC 7 was "pulled" and the billions he acquired from that tragic day.  I could go on and on, but I'll let some research the facts themselves...<br>  <br>  So does domestic terrorism threaten the USA?

Basically, anyone can report you, but your question/answer is only removed if certain people report you, or more than one person reports you. So, either one of those certain people reported you (these certain people usually only become those certain people because they only report true violations) because you didn't answer the question, or a whole bunch of people who did not want to hear any criticism of Obama reported you.<br>  <br>  If you still believe you did not truly violate the community guidelines, file an appeal.|`|r6JskEtxaa	I had.

Who knows who else is having problems and has been taking advice from people to lobbyist and I think lobbyist is just like the mafia.  It has been making our government more corrupting every day. Daschle has had so many problems that is why he was voted out in the past and I'm surprised that Obama try to put him in his administration.  Obama can't  be for real on his chosen group.

Barry Cuba needs you and we sure as hell don`t.|`|JthubNIsaa	You need to do some homework before you assume anything on this situation. That was my first opinion on it too. Here's the deal - Fannie/Freddie used to be the ones who were running the show. Then they fell into scandals with their accounting and CEO's were fired. That opened the door to the loan originator folks in Orange County California who changed the rules. They no longer had Fannie/Freddie dictating to them the rules so they made up their own. It was those guys - Quick Loan funding, Ameriquest, Own it, and others who started writing these loans and they sold them to the greedy bastards on Wall Street. Wall Street had been drooling for years to get in on the mortgage business because home values were skyrocketing. The bottom line is - these loan originators actively targeted ANYONE with a pulse because the more they wrote in loans, the more they made in profit. Not only that but Wall Street got even greedier and had their "financial engineers" fabricate a new item. It was called a Collateral Debt Obligation - "CDO". Even Alan Greenspan couldn't figure out what it was exactly. But they were able to get it AAA rated which means it was a secure Investment Grade proposition. Wall Street took these CDO's and sold them all over the world. All those who invested, lost everything when the market collapsed. Very complicated stuff. What's crazy is everyone in Washington knew it was going on. <br>  <br>  The home owners are not the entire problem here. Some maybe but the majority no. <br>  <br>  If you want to be angry at someone, you should be f****** pissed at Wall Street who caused this mess and has gotten billion and billions of bail out money. They should all be prosecuted and jailed for fraud.|`|M1u3IhFFaa	I thought Obama said we shouldn't live "beyond our means".  If he means what he says - shouldn't that apply to the free-loaders that took out loans they knew they couldn't pay back ?    Or is this just another line.  I pay my mortgage - even if it takes 2 jobs to do it;  or cutting back on essentials.  Personal responsibility is apparently out the window.|`|C2HHfun2aa	To buy votes and to keep his approval ratings as high as possible.

As I watch our Congress pass law after law that clearly violates the Tenth Amendment, I don't know what else can be done. With the public schools completely failing in their purported purpose of educating American kids in the American Constitution, most people today are unaware of the Tenth Amendment.<br>  <br>  I guess the American Revolution has finally died. I feel we are doomed.|`|CNSGz12zaa	Over the last 8 years our Govt. has encouraged corporations and manufacturers to leave our shores, resulting in massive domestic unemployment for the purpose of earning greater profits for owners, managers, and bureaucrats. It has all but totally bankrupted our workers and destroyed capital formation of a middle class domestically.<br>  <br>  By means of fractional reserve banking, fiat currency, and exponentially increasing credit required for a disintegrating financial system it has destroyed the basis of a sound economy. It disregards the growing problem of homelessness among our people. It has failed to address the problems of health care. In short, we know that we can do far better ourselves in our own States and communities with our own resources.|`|4a2c923b437f704e9782f91d4d0e3e8eaa	I suppose, technically, it is up to the Supreme Court<br>  to enforce the constitutionality of the laws.<br>  But, they can hardly be called the disinterested party<br>  to this.<br>  Ever since Marbury v Madison, the Court has<br>  slowly eroded the extent ot the reserved powers.<br>  <br>  Since they hold the power of the purse over the<br>   states, there is little incentive to challenge<br>  and risk losing that critical federal funding.<br>  <br>  Even secession has been attempted (1860), with tremendous cost and<br>  loss of life. <br>  But still the Fed eventually won that argument as well.
6lyGn3kKaa	The FBI. More than likely if the FBI comes to your house you are in bigger trouble than a US Marshall coming. A US Marshall may show up just because you went to another State after skipping court. The crime one committed in another State may not even be illegal in the State you went to, but they'll come after you. They also have far less education than FBI agents. Don't expect them to solve a crime or anything. Their almost like Bounty Hunters.|`|AA11494150	Neither is higher, they both have totally different functions.<br>  <br>  The FBI investigates violations of federal law.<br>  <br>  The US Marshals Service is not an investigative agency. They serve three primary functions: <br>  1. Security for federal courtrooms and judges,<br>  2. Transportation of federal prisoners, and<br>  3. Serving federal arrest warrants.|`|4t2kd03Waa	The best law enforcement agency is the local one where you live. The only thing that makes the FBI looked at if they are something special is the fact they have the funds to have a national finger print reservoir, laboratory, and other things listed on a national level.  The FBI is nothing without the support of local law enforcement.<br>  <br>  The Marshall's are an agency of federal courts for the most part, carrying out their directives.

c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	Because when you have a really lot of money, you have the ability to park some if it off-shore (in tax havens like Bermuda, Switzerland and the Caymans) and to put the rest of it into tax advantaged investments.  Once you reach that point you have no problem with taxes being raised and given as benefits to people who didn't earn it.    But I suspect that there are a lot of closeted Republicans in Hollywood - one thing about Liberals, if you don't agree with them, they hate you and that would translate into no jobs if you are in Hollywood.|`|ScZPVCUpaa	I don't know, when I found out Jimmy Stewart was a Republican married to an heiress, all my theories went out the window.

I believe that is one of the reasons they are so widely democratic.|`|eIhD4y8Waa	I have often wondered this myself.Several reasons come to mind,but the main reason I believe they are Dems. is that they, just like Dems. are elitists and they think they know what is best for us.|`|AA11963685	Most people in the entertainment industry are Democrats because they believe in small government when it comes to controlling other people's lives. They believe in freedom for their craft and that doesn't come when you support people who wish to control what you can say and how you say it and what is allowed to be broadcast, etc.   Republicans only believe in small government when it comes to money.  I know of many conservative actors, but you are right - the majority of them are liberal.|`|r1WMBKvuaa	Once you realise that the real movers and shakers in Hollywood, those that make the movies and TV, have Canadian beginnings, it will be easier to understand their political stands. They aren't "the liberal elite" or liberal Democrat anything, not even "Commies". They think and believe like their Canadian grandpas and grandmas did. I mean if you are a Canadian you just can't agree with an American, it just isn't done.

Artsy, creative people like to think of themselves as being more in touch with things than they actually are (narcissism I suppose) and the party that appeals to that part of their psyche is the Democratic Party.  It also has to do with guilt - and fear of being blackballed - lots of things I suppose.  Just my opinion of course.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	The arts require a certain mindset, and have been considered liberal for a long time, its liberal to try to go on stage rather than work at the local mine.    But the first answers also right, most liberal groups are more about aleiving people's white guilt than about making real change.
l4N0FJ3Yaa	The answer will never be the same, it will depend on your unit, the missions that are going on and the individual as well. Normally the deployments for Army Soldiers have been 12 months but shortly after OIF 2, they began to make them 15 months. I am on my third deployment and haven't had a 15 month tour yet. The issue with time off, leave and dwell time once again depends on your unit, the missions and the individual. Although dwell time is supposed to be 12 months, that is not always the case. Block leave upon redeployment is usually 30 days, once the unit has completed the necessary requirements. Back to the dwell time, the whole 12 month issue is overrated and if the unit needs you or wants to take you with them, you will be going. Yes you can fight the issue but please believe once your dwell time is up, the Army will come and find you. One of my Soldiers was to PCS to Fort Carson after we returned in Sept 2007. She left in November 2007 and was deployed by mid Feb 2008. Her unit told her dwell time is based on the unit and not the individual, which isn't true either. My battle buddy just left Iraq last month, her unit will have maybe 3-5 months at home and then they will be back on the plane to head to Afghanistan. Bottom Line Up Front.........Be prepared for anything and you won't ever be disappointed.|`|afAqlE3qaa	During the "troop surge" of 07-08, deployments were raised to 15 months  As of Aug. 2008, all units deploying in August or after do 12 months until further notice. For a 15 month deployment, the R&R (leave) time is 18 days. For a 12 month deployment it is 15 days. Also, between tours we have what they call dwell time. That is the time we are home before next deployment. It's usually about a year to a year and a half, subject to change.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	It was 15 months but back down to a year.

7obJr0lRaa	Wow, all of you people are full of irrational fears. 60-70% taxes? Are you kidding me? Massive redistribution of wealth? What?    Anyway, I'm studying abroad in Germany right now, and I can tell you that while it is a socialist country, things aren't that much different than in the US. Yes, taxes ARE higher, BUT it evens out because people don't have to put out so much money for things like health insurance.     There are of course poor people who barely make it by, but I can tell you that there are plenty of really rich people here and cruise around in their Mercedes SLR and shop at places I could never imagine affording. Socialist doesn't mean at all that everyone has the same amount of money - what it does try to do, is make sure that people don't simply get screwed over by the system.     If there is anything wrong with the system here, it's that there are too many people growing older and there won't be enough money in the future for them to live on after they retire, but guess what, we have EXACTLY the same problem with Social Security.    Of the four main "socialist" programs here in Germany, the US has their own version of three of them already. In the US there is already cheap health insurance if your family is poor (BluePlus in MN), unemployment benefits are built in to the system, and Social Security once you retire. If you don't like socialism, maybe we should get rid of those programs in the US.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	We would all be equally poor.

Also there is an huge list of Scandinavian applicants seeking U.S. citizenship- and I doubt it has much to do with the weather.|`|REiQzRB3aa	You can be happy in any situation if you have the positive mindset to always allow the best of your emotions to shine through the dark times. However, as others have probably already mentioned, the standard of living will go down making us all equally poor, or reliant on the government, since that's who you work for. You wouldn't have the freedoms that you do now, you'd be considered government property in a sense.    EDIT to your additional details:  We would all continue to pay taxes, however it would be much more than we pay now and it would be redistributed so everyone is equally classed. I guess if you are okay with everyone being the same in terms of living standards, regardless of how hard you work compared to others, then I guess you could be happy. It's almost like the entire country would be part of a government union (obviously not exactly, just an example of the sort).|`|tBSChaT9aa	No offense but, if I have to explain it to you then you need to do research....how many people do you see in America walking the streets who may appear on the surface to be happy of care free but, do you really know the struggles that they have in their lives. You should have spoken to the people there and got the voice from the man on the street...|`|EPpMkH5laa	Sweden is not really a socialist country. Rather, it is a free-market democracy just like the U.S., but with a larger public sector, higher income taxes and a more generous unemployment welfare system.     The current government is centre-right with policies somewhere close to the middle of the U.S. political spectrum - a mix of the more liberal parts of the U.S. Republican agenda and the more conservative / market friendly groups of the Democrats.    When comparing the two systems, please bear in mind that in many European countries, more services are paid for through your income and capital gains tax. Although an American family often pays less in direct income tax than a European family does, the American family has to pay for many services that are free in Europe - tuition fees for the kids to go to university and medical insurance for example.     Therefore, the standard of living in Sweden and the U.S. is quite similar (at least that is my impression after having spent time in both countries).    Key differences between the U.S. and Sweden is that healthcare and tuition in Sweden is basically free (or rather, paid for indirectly through taxes instead of directly through fees) and that you are pretty well taken care of if you lose your job. The obvious downside of this is that taxes must be higher to finance a larger public sector.    Critics of the system point out that is unfair that hard working people do not get to keep more of what they earn and that this removes individual incentives to work and invest. Supporters on the other hand argue that universal access to healthcare, tuition and generous unemployment benefits bring more benefits than disadvantages.    It is a complex question and there are many more pros and cons than the few ones I have listed above. However, the differences between the U.S. and Sweden are actually a smaller and fewer than one might think at first.     Countries that are culturally similar to the U.S. but politically more similar to Sweden are Canada and Australia - they might give you a hint of what the U.S. would look like with more European-like policies.

It does not matter if the father lives in NY but you will have to have him served with papers (there is a fee for that, too, depends on what the police in his area charge as they can serve).

WMWqpfokaa	Given that most Americans view the Economic Stimulus plan as belonging to President Obama and the media has touted it as HIS stimulus plan, of course the chimp is going to be viewed as representing Obama! <br>  <br>  Say what you like about who actually wrote and voted for the bill,  people's perceptions are their reality. The folks over at the NY Post aren't stupid and they understand this. <br>  <br>  Now, coupled with America's history of referring to African Americans as monkeys, apes, etc, this adds up to the cartoon being viewed as racist. <br>  <br>  Deny that it's racist, and you only make yourself look foolish! <br>  <br>  And another thing, the chimp that was shot and killed, maimed a woman so badly (ripping her face off) that she could not be identified as a woman by the first responders. That alone is enough to make the cartoon of the chimp offensive and in very poor taste. <br>  <br>  Having said all that, the Post is allowed to print whatever  it deems fit, and I have the right to not read it and distance myself from those who think this type of journalistic behavior is acceptable. <br>  <br>  Peace!|`|zze8XmjLaa	Because the dead monkey symbolizes the U.S. Congress, not Obama!<br>  <br>  Obama did not write and did not vote in the U.S. Congress.

Second of all if you turn off Maury and Jerry and switch to the news you will see that this week a chimpanzee tore apart a woman in Connecticut and the police had to shoot    it dead. Now again if you watch the news you would know that the  stimulus bill was in Congress and everyone was trying to make provisions to it. There were votes until late in the morning. It was hectic.<br>  <br>  It is easily understandable you would see this as racist when you do not have anything higher than a grade school education and you have been thought that the man keeps holding you down your entire life.<br>  <br>  Good question.

eab806b78844be11653db9be71af989caa	It sounds like you're beginning to solve your own problem.  Realizing that what you're doing is wrong is step one.  <br>  <br>  First, if you come from a low-income family, you should be getting help from the government for your college expenses.  If you're not, you need to talk to the Financial Aid office at your college.<br>  <br>  I don't want to offend you, but I really think you need some professional help.  I say this because you claim that you feel you deserve nice things, yet you have not worked and earned the money to buy them.  Being tired of being poor is the best reason to work hard at school and stop stealing.  If you are caught (and eventually you WILL) you will have a record.  That will affect your ability to get a job.  That will leave you stuck in the cycle of poverty.  If you let poverty drive you to do foolish things, you will stay poor.<br>  <br>  Do some research and see if your college has a counselor that you can talk to about your problem.  If you have medical insurance, you should find a therapist to help you.  Another option is to ALWAYS take someone to the store with you to stop you from stealing.  You should talk to your parents and be totally honest with them.  Tell them you have a real problem, and that you can't stop stealing.  Ask them if they'll help by going to the store with you when you buy necessities.  I know you're working min. wage and don't have a lot, but you should be able to buy necessities like body wash, shampoo, etc. at one of those dollar stores.<br>  <br>  You can do it, it just won't be easy.  Being a college student without money is never easy, but it is temporary.  Just don't mess up your opportunities in life for some make-up and clothes.  It's not worth it!<br>  <br>  Addition:  I know you can do this.  I worked at a college for several years, and I saw tons of students get out of East St. Louis and west side Chicago, and into a career.  The best advice I can give is to be resilient and positive.  I think that not having much money has caused you to have a lot of anger towards people who have more money than you.  And while it was those who had money who helped put you in the position you're in (I'm going to get e-mails about that statement), unfortunately it's those who have money who can also help you out.  The people who hire for jobs are trained to read people, and they'll see your bitterness.  Just try to look past everything that's wrong with your situation and look to a better future.  Where you come from doesn't have to be who you are.  If you can take that frustration that you feel and turn it into determination, you'll make it.<br>  <br>  Any time you make an excuse (like, I do what I do because I'm poor), you're showing weakness.  Don't ever let them see you weak!  You have fearlessness in you, I can tell.  Don't let not having things scare you.|`|BmR1j95Raa	I cry BS on this statement!  At least you are more transparent than Obamas European-Socialist bill!|`|3yvuMkzTaa	You seriously feel bad that if you didn't steal you would have to wear 3 year old clothing????<br>  WOW!!!!!!!!

yvPA8FSsaa	Well, first of all, what the Soviet Union had under Stalin and until it ultimately collapsed, was not Communism in the true sense but Socialism. <br>  <br>   Fascism is a system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.<br>  <br>  Socialism is any of various theories or systems of social organization in which the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy.  It is the stage in Marxist-Leninist theory intermediate between capitalism and communism, in which collective ownership of the economy under the dictatorship of the proletariat has not yet been successfully achieved.<br>  <br>  Basically,  Communism is system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single, authoritarian party holds power, claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people.<br>  <br>  Communism,  as a system is simply ridiculous.  By its own rules, it is not a classless system as is being claimed. There are clearly two classes; the ruling class and everyone else.  The concept of collective ownership of everything by everyone basically means ownership by the ruling class.  The biggest flaw with both systems is the lack of human rights or respect for individual liberty.<br>  <br>  But to directly answer your question, the difference between Fascism and Communism or Socialism is the racism.  Fascism has the added element of racial superiority.<br>  <br>  *|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Preemptive disclaimer - Yes, I KNOW it's not pure theoretical Communism, but it IS what happens here in the real world.<br>  <br>  Communism - The ruling class is overthrown, their wealth is plundered and the means of production is largely destroyed in a revolution. The revolutionaries make THEMSELVES the new ruling class and order a socialist economy far less efficient than anything their land has ever seen, exacerbating their earlier literal destruction of resources. They live a relatively opulent lifestyle at the expense of everyone else who are hopelessly, permanently locked into economic deprivation.<br>  <br>  Fascism - The ruling class "strikes first" to avoid having their stuff plundered and, more importantly, to avoid being lined-up and shot by revolutionaries. THEY order a socialist economy that is also less efficient than anything their land has ever seen but it's better than the communists' because they didn't wreck the place first and they DO know a little about how to be productive. They go on to live an amazingly opulent lifestyle at the expense of everyone else who are hopelessly, permanently locked into economic deprivation, but who think they're "fortunate" because the Communists are even worse-off.<br>  <br>  In common: Socialism - ruling class prevents upward mobility - life sucks for most people.<br>  Difference: Communists do it through revolution against the previous government, Fascists do it through policy in the existing government.<br>  <br>  Hitler and Stalin fought over turf, not ideology. Both were leftists. It's a spectacularly successful Democrat lie that Hitler was "right-wing."|`|bZy74U06aa	Ther are both leftist ideologies.  They both emphasize the collective over the individual.|`|iy2amkZPaa	Go to wikipedia.|`|ivdpHmaxaa	fascist wants to create terror amongst other races so that they can be the dominant/superior race. communism is the opposite of capitalism. in capitalism an individual can make tons of monies whilst communism will force the rich to share its wealth with the needy.|`|RSEp960aaa	both result in totalitarian methodologies, police states, nonexistent personal rights|`|gvukdlOjaa	Fascism involves a single individual that creates a cult of personality.<br>  <br>  REAL communism involves the working class as a whole to rise up against oppression by the ruling class and maintaining an equal status quo.<br>  <br>  Karl Marx wrote the "Communist Manifesto" targeting industrial nations in Europe, specifically Germany.  It wasn't meant for huge agrarian nations such as Russia to adapt as a political ideology.  That's why many experts believe that one of the main reasons the Soviet Union ceased to exist was because it was never really communist.<br>  <br>  While Stalin was in power in the Soviet Union, he was more of a dictator than a communist leader, therefore he was more of a fascist.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  Hitler and Stalin were leftists?  What are you smoking?<br>  <br>  Just because the Nazi party was called the National Socialist party doesn't mean they were socialists.  Socialism requires worker ownership and control over means of production.  The Nazi party was anything but that.  The means of produciton in Nazi Germany was owned by private individuals who were capitalists that were controlled the the Nazi party.  <br>  <br>  Hitler's other political beliefs place him almost always on the far right. He advocated racism over racial tolerance, eugenics over freedom of reproduction, merit over equality, competition over cooperation, power politics and militarism over pacifism, dictatorship over democracy, capitalism over Marxism, realism over idealism, nationalism over internationalism, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, common sense over theory or science, pragmatism over principle, and even held friendly relations with the Church, even though he was an atheist. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-hitler.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-hitler.h...</a><br>  <br>  Stalin was right-wing as well.  In fact, the term "anti-Stalinist left" was created to describe the leftists that were against Stalin's right-wing policies.<br>  <br>  Left or Marxist Opposition/Trotskyism: The associates and followers of Leon Trotsky, organised in the Left Opposition within the Communist parties before they were purged in the 1930s (see Moscow Trials). Trotskyists subsequently formed the Fourth International in opposition to the Stalinist Third International. Trotsky saw the Stalinist states as deformed workers states. Deformed workers states have a very anti-democratic political structure, that gives most workers very little power in decision making and reduces soviet democracy to a merely formal, bureaucratic process. Trotsky and his followers were very critical towards aspects of Stalinism such as: lack of internal debate among Stalinist organizations and societies and political repression enacted by Stalinist Governments (i.e The Great Purge); nationalist elements of Stalinist theory (see Socialism in One Country thesis, adopted by Stalin as state policy), that led to a very poor revolutionary strategy and characterization in an international contest (and breaking with the internationalist traditions of Marxism); and its dictatorial, bureaucratic, obscurantist, personalistic and high repressive methods (that Trotsky himself qualified as 'inquisitorial', in a famous speech that was read and internationally overcasted in English). Less orthodox Trotskyists and other critics of Stalin have seen it as a new form of class state, called bureaucratic collectivism (James Burnham, Milovan ?ilas, Max Shachtman) or as state capitalist (Tony Cliff, C.L.R. James). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Stalinist_left" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Stalin...</a><br>  <br>  Stalin did adapt some left-wing concepts, such as agricultural collectivization and rapid industrialization and even attacked the party's right, but it wasn't done for political reasons.  It was just another way of Stalin forcing his power onto others.

They thought that the people should be in charge and responsible for their own lives.<br>  <br>  2.  He was born to a Muslim father and a Agnostic mother.  He says that he is now Christian, however in a statement he made a couple weeks ago, he admits that he has relatives who are Muslim and has offered to bring Palestinian Muslims to America, give them housing, and jobs.<br>  <br>  3.  He is 1/2 black and 1/2 white.<br>  <br>  4.  Not sure on his environmental plans.<br>  <br>  5.  Joe Biden was picked to be V.P. because he could deliver the Pennsylvania vote.<br>  <br>  6.

He is half Kenyan half white, but he lived in an Asian country growing up so it can go all ways<br>  4.

Both parties have moved to the left and the citizens will pay for it for the next 20 years.|`|29d62a05347ef07bd705138d3bbd5eceaa	Honestly, I don't take sides of both parties nor am I a liberal or a conservative. I guess I take both ideas.<br>  It's not just Republican's fault that we're in this shape. It's just the government's fault for not acting about it quickly.<br>  I think they're just asking Obama these questions to test him and because America is at his and his administration's hands. One mistake can pull us lower into this economic crisis than we are now.<br>  Honestly, I think having both parties and both, liberals and conservatives, in Congress is a better idea than having just the demo. in congress.<br>  Throughout the course of history, it's proven that having mostly only one party in congress screws things over for our country.

kyTBaYFlaa	I met a guy who told me right off the bat he was just out of prison and he was a registered sex offender. He told me that when he was 19 and his wife was 19 they had been swingers. They met a girl who was working in a topless club dancing. They all became friends and she needed a place to stay so they let her move in. They were all having sex together. Then they stopped getting along and it all blew up. Turned out the girl was only 16. The guy went to court and the girl who had always dressed very adult before showed up in court looking every bit like a 16 year old. The guy had to plead guilty to prevent them from prosecuting his wife too. Never mind that they met the girl while she was working in a club as a topless dancer or that she had previous convictions for drugs and prostitution. He served like 5 years and to top it off his wife left him while he was in prison after he had plead guilty to protect her from facing the same charge.|`|8pt0fYPOaa	Aszu - yes and no - the fact is there is a significant difference in maturity, other than chronological age between a 14 year old and a 19 year old.  It is statutory rape, because the younger person is not capable of fully understanding the implications of sex, and is easily taken advantage of - especially by predators.<br>  <br>  You need to seriously look at the development of the human brain and emotional maturation of those in their teens in order to fully appreciate laws that protect children from predators.  Not only that, when these laws are tampered with, then what happens is that where do you draw the line? 11? 10? 6?  Do see the progression? now we are talking pedophilia, incest etc.<br>  <br>  A matured person of 25 tends to want to be with their peers - within 2 - 3 years difference - they do not want to be hanging around with those in their early teens - Do you seriously think there is nothing wrong with a 31 year old messing around with a 15 year old?|`|AA12109395	I happen to believe that the laws are necessary.<br>  <br>  As an adult, we have the right (to an extent) to make bad choices and then be held accountable for those bad choices.<br>  <br>  As a minor, one is making decisions that can affect the rest of their lives without (sometimes) having the wisdom, experience and maturity to make those decisions. So, parental guidance is necessary. When that fails, the law must prevail.<br>  <br>  Because for those so inclined, it sets up a preditorial relationship whereby the minor is (sometimes) taken advantage of.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Well here is one thing to consider too, you know sometimes a minor will accuse someone of statutory rape or their parents will accuse someone of statutory rape when in all actuality it never occured.  <br>  <br>  I agree there should be laws to protect minors from having sex, but let's say the girl is 16 and she is a willing participant and then her parents find out and they press charges and the girl lies about what happened, then it isn't right.  The other thing here is that really a child of 16 shouldn't be having sex, but let's face it THEY DO.|`|voD8gnmcaa	i mean lets say a 18 year old is going out w a 16 year old..thats HS. basically if they have sex its illegal. i think thats stupid. its not like a30 year old is having sex w a 16<br>  <br>  consent is consent = not rape|`|sG7E4vDgaa	Yeah, whatever you say chester.|`|ywTkV4N8aa	Half of the wedding nights a hundred years ago would violate statutory rape laws today.

Every death associated with tasers has had some other contributing factor. Most common is drug overdose. <br>  <br>  Electricity does not remain in the body, so as soon as the device is removed, there are no lasting effects, and no chance of permanent damage.<br>  <br>  However, even with that said, I'm not sure a taser would be your best course of action under the circumstances.

Your brother won't benefit directly from the petitions that you're filing for your parents. So, he can't stay in the US simply because they can. Your parents could file for him once they get their green cards, and their petition would be an F2a and only take 5 years, if he's still under 21 at the time they file.

cc8a1da5bcd8a28a3d70ec6a97690a79aa	There are many ways for you to pay for school.  The military is not the only way.<br>  <br>  If your family do not make that much, you will probably qualify for student grants. These are FREE money the government gives you to go to college.  You will first have to fill out the FAFSA to see what your family ETC is (expected family contribution).  Fill out the FAFSA at www.fafsa.ed.gov.  The lower your ETC score is, the more money you will get.<br>  <br>  Student loans is another option.  Everyone will qualify for student loans which you will not have to repay until you are out of college.  I don't remember the maximum amount, but I owe over $50k in student loans so its up there =).  Also, student loans have typically low loan interest rates, around 3-6%.<br>  <br>  I am personally thinking about joining the Army now that I have my 4-yr BS degree.  Why? 1) They will pay off my $50k student loans 2) I get to enlist as an E-4 instead of E-1 (rank and pay). 3) The army lets you choose the job you want. Since I want to become a dentist, I will hopefully get to be a Dental Specialist (similar to Dental Assistant in civilian world) to be some clinical experience.<br>  <br>  I'm using the Army as a way to pay off my student loans and get hands-on clinical experience which dental school loves.  Granted, plenty of people get into dental school straight from college, but I'm doing what I think is best for me.  The best way to get into dental school is to make sure you maintain a high GPA ~3.5+ , good DAT scores 20+, and good extracurriculars like volunteering, shadowing, research and clinicals if possible.<br>  <br>  If you're doing this only for money, its probably a bad idea.  I would get grants and loans first, kick butt in college and the DAT, then apply to dental school your 3rd year of college.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	If you want to pursue your education sooner rather than later, your best bet is probably the Guard or maybe the Reserves.  YOu'll get more money for school if you do some active duty first, but you would have to wait longer to start school.  If you take ROTC, that will give you some more incentives too.  YOu may not go completely free but it will certainly be cheaper and have fewer student loans than going it on your own with student loans and a part time job.|`|AA10709853	no.<br>  <br>   One the programs that allow for them to pay your way through both your Undergrad and Grad degrees are VERY competitive.  and many times they do not cover all expenses.  <br>  <br>  another thing.. you say you want to join just for the college money.. if you are not willing to also fork over 8-10 years of your life afterward in service and be deployed, then don't  bother.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	They will not pay for ALL of your college.

It's a widely known fact that Nixon had been sick the day of the debate and the previous week, so not only was he clammy, but he'd also lost some weight from not being able to keep food down. So, the clamminess made him look like he was sweating nervously, and his suit was hanging on him wrong as he had lost weight over the previous week. But Kennedy, of course, looked extremely well, and just that in and of itself I believe effected the course of the election.|`|imTDlODnaa	the media choose the president not the people|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	generally speaking, that's not really the case.|`|FaEoNy5Kaa	The media has sway-but We The People are the dumb ones who follow the message like lamb to the slaughter.

Q8GFvklUaa	Well all the other bailouts took money and gave it too banks and businesses.<br>  <br>  The problem with that is if your a bank and have 2 million in unpaid debt and you get 2 million in bailout, the people still owe the money.<br>  Therefore the CEO's of the bank used that money for other purposes (ie AIG spending over 100,000 dollars on a success party, and citibank "loosing it").<br>  <br>  The bank could not do these things before due to the fact they are owed money from unpaid loans, when they get bailout money they do not pay off the loans they use the money for other things. The people are still broke and still owe the bank. The bank still attempts to collect the loans (probably using bailout money to pursue the loans). <br>  <br>  In the end nothing really changed, just like throwing money at a problem doesn't fix it.<br>  <br>  Deregulation from President Clinton's second term (I don't think he did it on purpose though, he had good intentions) and President Bush's lack of keeping things in check, got us there today.<br>  <br>  I just hope there is a way to fix it, truthfully I think you have to go in and start regulating business and banking again.|`|AA12205273	President Bush had a stimulus for banks.

Your boyfriend (girlfriend)could be your dependent if he lived with you for the entire year, was either a US citizen, US resident, Canadian resident or Mexican resident, was not filing a joint return with his spouse (if any), had gross income less than the amount of a personal exemption ($3300 in 2006), you provided more than half of his total support and he has a taxpayer identification number.  See IRS Pub 501 for detail explanations of the above rules.  http://www.irs.gov/publications/index.ht...|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	If he supported her all year and she lived with him and she made less than $3500 he just may be able to claim her as a dependent.

Not allowing people to claim those not related to them keeps away a black market of selling credits and exemptions, incentivizes people to get married, start families, and further grow the ecomony.  Is she a us citizen, if not he cant claim her.  at least for the 2008 tax year, if she were a member of the household, income under 3500, he provided more than half her support, adn no one else can claim her on their taxes, he should be able to.  I think previous to that, the exemption was not there for nonrelatives, but i am not sure

Before the 32 week recruit training takes place, those hoping to become a Royal Marine must undergo a grueling initial selection process.  Eligibility  To attempt to become a Royal Marine, the following requirements apply :  ? male   ? ages 16-33   ? no formal academic qualifications required   ? British, Irish or Commonwealth citizenship   Initial Selection   ? Academic Tests   o Reasoning   o English Language   o Numerical   o Mechanical Comprehension   ? A personal interview   ? Pre-joining fitness test   ?

It probably will. Also good luck. Royal marines have one of the toughest basic training program in the world.    Deutsch KSK|`|AA11705909	Maybe, maybe not. You will have to be as fit as a butchers dog and if you can run a 6-7 minute mile before entry you should be OK.  Be aware that there is a 70% drop out rate for Marine training.

Who wants to listen to leftist opinionated rants? If they had something interesting to say or informative, maybe, but it is all slanted to fit into their little window of liberalism. They don't like to debate, either. They yell at objectors and bring on guests that agree with them. It sucks. <br>  <br>  I do listen just to get an idea of what they are talking about, but frankly I hate it. I find myself yelling at the radio/TV at their bad analysis, poorly formed opinions, simplistic blatherings. It is the ranting that gets me to shut it off. Don't mention Slobberman, I can't take him after a minute. (Joe S. bail out will ya? Cut the contract and make the deal.)<br>  <br>  I listened to Bernie Ward before he was arrested.

I never could, tho, for long and I took note of their advertisers and avoid them.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	We have 'em here in San Francisco...<br>  <br>  Every radio station ends up liberal talk...even if they don't mean to be. Especially when they are reading the news. I am surprised they haven't shorted out their microphones from hissing and spitting out the words "Bush, House Republicans, Sarah Palin, etc."  Not to mention the sarcasm, ridicule and smirking noises.<br>  <br>  On the radio listing it calls the Liberal stations "Talk" but the conservative stations are designated "Conservative Talk" or "Talk, Michael Savage" or "Talk: Rush Limbaugh" Haha...as if their viewpoint is just normal, common sense talk, and the conservative stations...hey they label two of them with the name of the most conservative host like, "Rush Limbaugh...enough said"<br>  <br>  Mainly they read over the latest vote from Sacramento and trash the Reps for voting against something (after telling a long, melodramatic story complete with interview of the victim...about some damn program I am paying for that is in danger of getting cut or reduced.)

Who the heck is Attorney Berg? And then Larry Sinclair...hey...they pulled out all the stops and it was like listening to the National Enquirer...and I didn't really believe any of it...little did I know...I recall how interesting it was to have liberals attacking a liberal.

We stand behind the Clintons, Obama, and Carter.<br>  <br>  We believe in many of the social programs of the Democrats and think most Republicans are just a bunch of greedy, heartless crooks.<br>  <br>  We believe that home owners make better citizens than non-home owners, not because they own homes, but because they know first hand what sacrifices it takes to buy and keep a home.  Take those sacrifices and responsibilities  away and you take away the magic of the home owner being better for society.<br>  <br>  We have accepted that our 401 k is now a 201 k.  We are 60 years old and will need our retirement soon.  Our IRA's are shadows of their former selves.  Our single modest house has shrunken 30% in value.<br>  <br>  We took early retirement packages and now no one will hire 60 year olds for anything other than minimum wage, even though I was an electrical Engineer and my wife has a Masters degree in counseling.  Things look tough;  real tough.<br>  <br>  We have been buying only used cars for the last 15 years.  Vacations are always in the USA;  we  quit eating out several years ago and cancelled cable TV to make ends meet.  We are barely making it.  We paid off our mortgage and thought that was a good idea.<br>  <br>  Now we find out that people that haven't been trying so hard to be self sufficient are going to get a handout for their extravagant life style.  And WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WITH INCREASED INFLATION AND TAXES.<br>  <br>  I think some "leaders" and politicians are mis reading how much us good guys can (or will) sacrifice for the sake of people that cant figure out that you should not spend more money than  you make.  My grand father had a second grade education and he knew this.  <br>  <br>  You can bail out those stupid home buyers if you must,  BUT I WANT A PIECE OF THEIR ASSETS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF RELIEF GIVEN!!<br>  <br>  ( If these folks dont have jobs, what makes you think that you aren't just wasting money saving their home for a few months?  What is the payback if they loose the house in less than  two years?)<br>  <br>  WE do vote and we vote with everything we have.  The  honest bill paying citizens are big activists; We campaign, we donate to candidates, we lead civic causes, we volunteer, .  Don't get us angry over this thinking we can be taken for granted again.  we wont put up with this.   We will get our pound of flesh.<br>  <br>  Dont read us wrong.  We wont  bail out the victims of their own folly without some equity in their houses!!  Bail them out if it has to be, but, no free lunch.  If they accept 50k assist on their 500k house, I want  to own 10% of the house!  they can stay, but when it sells at a profit, I want my money back! and if it sells at a loss, I want my per cent!!|`|9klx10iKaa	the 11 second commercial that ran before the news clip caught my attention.

Go  to large  unused  parking  lot  or  away from residential  traffic  area.  Teach  one  thing  at  time.

This gives him permission to be able to drive around your block. If the police stops you guys and he does have a permit, then you will be fine. It is not illegal however to teach him to drive, but he will just watch and observe of what you do.

The whole idea that the government is there to help us is wrong. If that was truly the case then why are only two parties invited to debate in presidential debates? The two parties have locked out people of other ideologies in order to maintain power. They do not want a new group in the way and they have passed laws to prevent the other groups from having a real shot at being elected. <br>     Our forefathers via the Constitution put down rules to prevent government from controlling every aspect of our life as well as protecting our private property rights (which includes protecting our pay from being taken for social programs). The politicians have exceeded their rightful power and it is us that has to cut our budgets to make up for their abuses. When the government provides for all of our needs they can withhold the things we need most to control us and remove our freedom.<br>  <br>    The MOM you are absolutly right. I only hate the government we can not control. If I remember right it is supposed to be for the people by the people. You see that is the problem today, our government thinks they are supposed to control us but that is not upholding the Constitution.|`|eb66409c880bce00f4bc5114e17ab3e2aa	Spoken like a true Socialist.<br>  <br>  The Government is not there for us and should not be there for us.  The federal Government was intended to maintain state organization and a military force.  Not all the bull-crap they have it doing today.  That was the States responsibility.  Even then, the State relied on the Counties to provide for their people.  <br>  <br>  Before our "wonderful government" got involved with our education system, the schools were producing the worlds most brilliant minds.

The war has been mishandled but I am glad that Saddam no longer has power in Iraq and he has caused suspicions in the past. The war was mishandled though. He actually dealt with the days after 9/11 well given that he had America united more than any other president in history and he did inherit a hindered military thanks to Clinton. As for the economy, there is not much the President can do when the houses contain a majority of the power. Do you realize that Obama was part of the Democratic congress after 2006. The economic failure was due to bad banking practices, bad government influences from both sides and greed. Overall the government should grow smaller and allow free ente3rprise to commence, we actually grew great off of it. Was Bush a failure, no, he was not the best nor the worst, Obama is already spreading legislation for nationalization of bank and healthcare that will only leave us worse off. Both sides have been moving farther left and the day will come when we will need to take the reigns of the country and Constitution back and make it represent the will of all people, not a powerful politically correct few.

pFrjLlJ4aa	Ummm.  No.  Being banned means you are not welcome.  You don't have a right to volunteer somewhere and they don't have an obligation to accept you as a volunteer.  You can ASK to be permitted to volunteer and they may accept your offer, but they darn sure don't have to.<br>  <br>  You can volunteer  (meaning offer) to work anywhere you like, doing anything you'd like.  But nobody has to accept your services.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	Banned means that you may not return to the premises under any circumstances unless they remove the ban. That includes returning for any reason, with no exceptions.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Thats up to the library itself.   First,  you have to get them to remove the ban (this is done through a letter requesting an appointment to discuss it).    They have the final say in rather you volunteer,   but if you have a history of disruptive behavior,   then you will have a task ahead to convince them you have changed and are more mature than you were at the time.<br>  <br>  There is no explicit law that states once the ban is lifted,   you cannot volunteer there.    People are re-hired after being fired all the time,  its the same thing.|`|MOALBorJaa	It would be solely up to the library.|`|LeaUjOoUaa	You certainly couldn't just walk in to the library and declare yourself a volunteer. The library would have the final say on accepting a volunteer just as they would in hiring someone. Most establishments that have volunteers require background checks. The process is very much like applying for a paid position. I would think that it would be likely that the library would consider someone that was banned would be ineligible to volunteer. The individual has already demonstrated that they do not conduct themselves in an appropriate manner, as deemed by the library and the ban placed on them. One would have to assume that the same behavior might continue so why bother taking the risk.

The constitution does not say we have to listen. The fairness doctrine does.|`|g2GSdY8Aaa	No, it may not be an issue however, Obama has indicated he would not pursue it. That should tee off the left.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Yes.  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine in 1969, the case of Red Lion Broadcasting Co. vs FCC.  A journalist named Fred Cook wrote a book about Goldwater, calling him an extremist. Cook was the subject of an on-air diatribe by Billy James Hargis (perhaps the first radio televangelist), and insisted on being allowed to come on the air and give his side of the story.  The Supreme Court found in Cook's favor 8-0.<br>  <br>  In the court's opinion, Justice Byron White said:<br>  <br>  "A license permits broadcasting, but the licensee has no constitutional right to be the one who holds the license or to monopolize a radio frequency to the exclusion of his fellow citizens. There is nothing in the First Amendment which prevents the Government from requiring a licensee to share his frequency with others.... It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount."|`|IW3jmnKbaa	Way more than "asset forfeiture", and the "patriot act 1, and 2".<br>  Why do you care if both sides of a news story have to be represented, when cops can break in your door, arrest you take all your possessions, lock you up forever, and even torture you, all without charges or a warrant.<br>  That's what you should care about, that's what we all should care about.<br>  The American government has turned into a terrorist regime.<br>  If you don't believe me, there are lots of sites that back up every word.

vQD5IX9daa	Unless his MOS is infantry, and he went to an infantry basic training, he will first go to his A.I.T. school (advanced individual traning). This can be from 3 to 27 weeks, depending on what job he is training for.<br>  He will stay stateside for this entire time, though AIT is alot like basic training but with a few more privaleges.<br>  Until he is assigned to a unit after his AIT, he will not know for certain where he is going or for how long. (they get deployed with their UNIT, not individually)<br>  If the unit he is assigned to is being deployed right away, he may STILL stay stateside assigned to a different unit. (The military likes you to have SOME on the job training before shipping you out, although this is not always the case)<br>  <br>  In other words, it's a guessing game until he is actually assigned. He  can check his ERB online, and once he's assigned his unit will appear there.<br>  <br>  As far as contact, Japan is not a war zoone, and I have a very good freind who is stationed there now (Air Force).
