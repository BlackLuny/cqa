20061231105144AA9GHQ4	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Sanyo HT32744 HDtv Picture discoloring, please help.?	I have a 2 year old Sanyo HDtv. After it has been on for 30 minutes the color starts to turn to a purple-ish/blue. I think it might be a voltage regulator, but I was wondering if anyone knew any better. I am really not sure and don't know about realigning the picture tube or whatever it is called. Could that be the cause? Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

20061109041817AA1wPzJ	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	How do i block a telephone number from calling (READ ON)?	I have had a company trying to ring me on my mobile for the past week. I picked up once and they hung up. They still keep ringing me and i havent picked up again mainly because Im at work. Also after a little research i have found they offer mobile phone contracts. It could be a scam. Either way, i dont care, i want to know how to block them from even calling me. I have a Sony Ericsson W810i and am on a flext mobile contract with T-mobile. Unlike my old samsung d500 i dont appear to have an option to block numbers on my phone itself. Obviously if theres nothing else i can do Im going to get in contact with T-mobile. Just wondering if anyone has any useful suggestions..      Thanks
