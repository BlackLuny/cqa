Als da die ersten Eisenbahnen eingeführt wurden, musste ein Mann mit einer roten Fahne vornedraus laufen, um die Fu?g?nger zu warnen. Das ist jetzt fast zweihundert Jahre her. Seit jener Zeit bedeutet die rote Farbe im Verkehr "Vorsicht! Gefahr". 1868 stand die erste rot-grüne Ampel vor dem Unterhaus in London. Das grüne Licht w?hlte man, weil es in der Farbenlehre die sogenannte "Komplement?rfarbe", das genaue Gegenteil von "Rot" ist. Die gelbe Farbe kam sp?ter als dritte dazu, weil es die einzige ist, die so kr?ftig wie Rot und Grün leuchtet.<br>  <br>  Als man 1917 in New York begann, Verkehrsampeln aufzustellen, übernahm man die drei Farben. In Deutschland wurde die erste leuchtende Verkehrsampel mit drei Farben 1924 aufgestellt - auf dem Potsdamer Platz in Berlin.

MDAsnqH0aa	La mejor prueba para saber si un motor debe repararse o no es hacer una prueba de Compresion y fugas, para esto vas a necesitar un compresometro y una compresora, primero debes desconectar la bobina, sacar una bujia y colocar el compresometro en lugar de esta, dar marcha y verificar en la caratula la presion medida, cuando menos debe estar en 90 psi debes repetir esta prueba en cada uno de los cilindros, si la presion es demasiado baja, debes continuar con la siguiente prueba: inserta aire a alta presion por cada uno de los orificios de las bujias y detectar por donde sale, (bayoneta, cabezas o escape) si sale por la bayoneta o escape, no hay duda tus anillos ya no estan sellando de manera correcta contra el bloque de cilindros y vas a tener cuando menos que anillar, si sale por la cabeza posiblemente tengas pegada una valvula, otra mas sencilla pero que no dice mucho es revisar si la bujia esta mojada con aceite o bien identificar si el aceite tiene gasolina, esto puedes hacerlo oliendo el aceite impregnado en la bayoneta, en cualquiera de los casos si da positivo tendras que reparar tu motor.|`|jvyBYGrQaa	Una prueba de compresion indica que tanto desgaste tiene tu motor.

MDAsnqH0aa	Los aceites se conforman de la siguiente forma:<br>  <br>  Aceite Base, Paquete de Aditivos y Tecnologia<br>  <br>  El aceite base es el que determina que tipo de aceite se formara, un aceite semisintetico esta conformado por basicos del grupo III, esto significa que son aceites minerales derivados del petroleo refinados mediante un proceso que se llama severamente hidrofraccionados con contenidos minerales como el azufre y un indice de viscosidad minimo de 120, pero finalmente tiene bacterias que quedaron de la refinacion, estas pueden convertirse en oxido y nitratos, que son los agentes que degradan las propiedades de lubricidad en el aceite, en resumen un aceite semisintetio recibe una refinacion muy compleja para reducir los agentes contaminantes y ampliar su capacidad de lubricidad pero no va a dar el mismo rendimiento de un sintetico que no contiene basico derivado del petroleo por lo que no tiene agentes degradantes y por el contrario tiene un IV minimo de 168.<br>  <br>  Por ultimo, el beneficio para tu motor con un aceite semisintetico, sera la maxima proteccion ante cualquier temperatura o arranque en frio, pero solo te dara esta proteccion por un maximo de 7500 Kms, en cambio un Sintetico tambien te dara la maxima proteccion al motor pero por un periodo maximo de 15,000 Kms.|`|611908f81a7102ad212381408302d201aa	el sintetico es un aceite elaborado sin utilizar aceites minerales, y el semisintetico es una mezcla de ambos, aceite mineral y sintetico.|`|GmXPuhQfaa	el sintético te dura mas y es mas bueno ke el semisintético|`|miCbhygRaa	el aceite sintetico es un aceite bien elaborado y el aceite semi sintetico es una mezcla de aceite sintetico y aceite barato

MDAsnqH0aa	Los aceites se componen de tres factores<br>  <br>  1.- Aceite base,<br>  Esto es el resultado de la refinacion del petroleo, a su vez se dividen en grupos:<br>  Grupo I Derivado del petroleo, refinacion por solventes Grupo II Derivado del petroleo hidrofraccionado<br>  Grupo III Derivado del petroleo severamente hidrofraccionado<br>  Grupo IV Sinteticos polialfaolefinas<br>  Grupo V todos los que no se incluyen en los anteriores.<br>  <br>  De ahi viene el que un aceite sea monogrado (una sola temperatura) multigrado (rango de temperaturas) semisinteticos (rango de temperaturas alto rendimiento) y sintetico (mayor rango de temperatura, alto rendimiento  y mayor durabilidad), cada uno respectivamente a los Grupos mencionados.<br>  <br>  El proposito de un aceite es disminuir la friccion que ocasiona el desgaste de las piezas, mediante una pelicula que se forma entre las piezas que estan en contacto, la friccion es una forma de producir calor y si es suficientemente alta podria evaporar el aceite y eliminar esta pelicula, la forma de medir que tanto va a soportar el cambio de temperatura sin alterar su composicion se mide en el IV (indice de viscosidad)<br>  <br>  ya que decides que basico vas a ocupar seleccionas el segundo componente que es<br>  2.- Paquete de aditivos,<br>  Estos son una infinidad, pero entre los principales y que debes poner mayor atencion son los mejoradores de IV, antidesgaste, antiespumante, antioxidante, antiherrumbre, extrema presion, lubricante solido, antiacido, detergente y modificador de friccion, esto te lo van dando las marcas de acuerdo a la importancia que le de cada una a cada uno de estos aditivos.<br>  <br>  por ultimo el 3.- Tecnologia, que es como la receta secreta de cuanta cantidad de cada aditivo tienen para segun ellos ser el que mejor cubra todos sin choque quimico.<br>  <br>  todos los aceites tienen que estar regulados asi como una certificacion ISO solo que el organismo mas comun de certificar los lubricantes es el SAE, este mide la viscosidad cinematica (resistencia de un fluido a fluir a cierta temperatura regularmente a 40°C) es una prueba donde se calienta el aceite a esta temperatura y se pone en una superficie con ciertas rugosidades y se inclina a ciertos grados y el tiempo que tarde en llegar de un punto a otro se llaman centistoke que si los comparas con una tablita que tiene la SAE veras que un aceite puede tener una viscosidad SAE 40, 50 etc, ahora si lo calientan ademas de los 40°c a 100°c tendran un rango de temperatura y viscosidad diferente es cuando obtienes un SAE 5W40 la W es de winter 50 osea que tendras en invierno un SAE 5 y en verano un SAE 40 a mayor numero es mas grueso osea es mas espeso.<br>  <br>  Espero no haberte aburrido con tanto rollo pero es el principio basico de lubricacion, si requieres mayor informacion con gusto te la puedo enviar|`|rjv8Zmsoaa	hola autolico<br>  pues tu dime hasta donde quieres que llegue porque es un tema que conozco mucho, trato de ser lo mas sintetico posible y sencillo:<br>  <br>  MONOGRADO-MULTIGRADO<br>  <br>  El aceite monogrado solo tiene un grado de viscocidad como base, se usaba en motores carburados, los cuales por sus bajas revoluciones solo llegaban a temperaturas no mayores a 85 grados centigrados.<br>  Ej: SAE 40 ( solo un grado termico)<br>  <br>  El aceite multigrado llega a tener una variacion entre su grado de viscocidad por ejemplo en el mas comun 20w50, esta variacion existira solo de 20 hasta 50, esta variacion existe dependiendo de la temperatura, entre mas caliente mas grueso es(50), y mientras mas frio es mas delgado(20), el aceite multigrado se usa en motores de inyeccion electronica, ya que son autos que trabajan normalmente a temperaturas mayores a 100grados centigrados.<br>  <br>  QUE LUBRICA EL ACEITE:<br>  <br>  Lo que lubrica el aceite principalmente son los metales de las bielas y de los arboles, y tienen una abertura entre el metal y la biela o el arbol , asi que no puedes usar un aceite de grueso como un 20w50 en un auto nuevo lo unico que haras sera reducir la potencia del auto y acortaras la vida del motor ya que estaras forzando las las bielas y arbol (es), y al igual en un motor con digamos 150 mil km no puedes usar un aceite de un grado ligero como un 5w40 ya que el aceite sera muy delgado y quiza pudieran hasta llegar a sonar las bielas por el demasiado juego que habra, y hasta podria llegar a pasar por los anillos y echarte humo.<br>  <br>  TIPOS DE ACEITE:<br>  <br>  Existen 3 tipos de aceite:<br>   - dos de ellos son a base de minerales comunmente llamado monogrado y multigrado, estos son recomendables cambiarlos a los 5000km y maximo 7000km, sin importar el tiempo, nada de 6 meses ya que hay autos que recorren muchos km por mes.<br>  <br>   - El ultimo es el Sintetico a base de quimicos que al igual es multigrado, este aceite se recomienda solo en autos recientes o de inyeccion electronica por sus grados de viscocidad, que esten en excelentes condiciones ya que es mucho mas delgado y en un motor comun provocaria fugas, consumo de aceite y hasta humo azul por ser muy delgado.  Este aceite es recomendable cambiarlo entre los 15.000 a 20.000 km.<br>  <br>  FUNCIONES DEL ACEITE:<br>  <br>  Son tres principalmente:<br>  1: Lubricar.<br>  2: Refrigerar.<br>  3: Limpiar. <br>  <br>  NORMAS:<br>  los aceites lubricantes deben cumplir diversas normas que certifican su calidad:<br>  API de EEUU<br>  ACEA de europa<br>  propias del fabricante ( GMC, VW, FORD, etc)<br>  <br>  saludos|`|178585c0385731d09a8cb554071b5f9eaa	El aceite de motor es como la sangre para el cuerpo humano. Su función principal es reducir la fricción entre los metales que componen el motor. <br>  Al lubricar un motor... <br>  <br>  sus piezas quedan protegidas por una película de aceite y se deslizan suavemente.<br>  El roce disminuye, se necesita menos fuerza para mover las piezas.<br>  Las piezas están protegidas, se desgastan menos.<br>  Las superficies en movimiento se deslizan suavemente, hay menor riesgo de sobrecalentamiento.<br>  Las piezas metálicas que están bien lubricadas hacen menos ruido al deslizarse o chocar entre ellas.<br>  Las superficies están aceitadas, al entrar en movimiento resbalan y no tiritan. <br>  Para facilitar el arranque en frío, enfriar las piezas del motor, mantener el motor limpio, para prevenir la herrumbre. <br>  <br>  Existen distintos tipos de aceite, según su viscosidad. No cualquier aceite puede ser usado en cualquier motor y condición de trabajo. La viscosidad tiene que ver con la capacidad de fluir. Los líquidos espesos escurren con mucho más dificultad que los delgados. Así, mientras más viscoso sea un aceite, menor será su tendencia a escurrir sobre las superficies a lubricar.<br>  <br>  Los cambios de temperatura afectan la viscosidad. Cuando el motor está detenido, con sus piezas frías, la viscosidad del aceite es mucho mayor que cuando está en marcha y la combustión ha calentado las piezas.<br>  <br>  ACEITES MONOGRADOS y MULTIGRADOS <br>  Los primeros aceites que existieron para coches fueron los MONOGRADOS, si analizamos la palabra MONO = 1, GRADOS = Temperatura. Por lo que se desprende del análisis de la palabra, que estos aceites tenían una sola temperatura ideal de trabajo. Hablamos de temperatura de trabajo, a la cual el aceite circula bien y posee todas sus características de lubricación. <br>  Si uno usaba un aceite monogrado en una zona cálida, en poco tiempo el aceite tomaba su temperatura de trabajo, o sea que el motor no sufría prácticamente. Pero si lo tenia que usar en una zona fría, la cosa se complicaba un poco. Ni que hablar si la temperatura estaba bajo de los 0oC. Los motores sufrían muchisimo, ya que costaba que mucho que el aceite tomara su temperatura, por lo que los primeros segundos después del arranque, dentro del motor era fierro con fierro (acá en el sur cuando existían solamente los aceites monogrados, se les hacia fueguito debajo del motor). <br>  <br>  Entonces aparecen los aceites MULTIGRADOS, MULTI = Varios, GRADOS = Temperatura. <br>  Se le realizan tratamiento térmico al aceite y se agregan aditivos (antioxidantes, antiespumantes, para mantener en estado liquido el hollín, etc., etc.), de esta manera pueden trabajar en diferentes temperaturas. Con los aceites MULTIGRADOS quedan solucionado las variaciones de temperatura que podemos tener en el día y así, no sufre tanto el motor. <br>  <br>  GRADO SAE<br>  <br>  <br>  La tabla de las viscosidades, la saque del manual de instrucciones FIATALLIS, quiero que quede claro que es solamente INDICATIVA, hay aceites del mismo grado SAE, pero su rango temperatura es un poco más amplio. Para que quede claro a continuación coloco un ejemplo: Elaion SJ (API SJ, S.A.E. 15W40) la temperatura de trabajo es de -15oC y 40oC, en el Tutela Urania 15W40, la temperatura de trabajo es de – 10o C a 50o. <br>  <br>  S.A.E 5W30 = -30oC a 20oC.<br>  S.A.E 10W30 = -25oC a 20oC.<br>  S.A.E 15W40 = -15oC a 40oC.<br>  <br>  Los aceites para motores son catalogados por la calidad de servicio API (American Petroleum Institute). Los envases de los aceites que contengan el sello API,  tienen la certificación de  que contienen las formulaciones y los más altos estándares de calidad especificados por los fabricantes de vehículos. <br>  <br>  Existen aceites monogrados y multigrados. La viscosidad de los aceites monogrados, formulados para vehículos hasta el a?o 85, varía ampliamente con los cambios de temperatura, sobre todo en el encendido y a la temperatura de operación normal de los motores. La cantidad de detergentes en la formulación de los aditivos de los aceites multigrados, es mayor que en los monogrados, lo que permite remover mayor cantidad de residuos, unido a una mayor estabilidad de la viscosidad con la temperatura. Para motores con mucho kilometraje y hasta el a?o 85 que vienen usando aceites monogrado, no es recomendable cambiar de una vez a aceites multigrado ya que podrían removerse los residuos y obstruir los filtros del motor. <br>  <br>  El cambio de aceite de monogrado a multigrado podría realizarse de forma progresiva, comenzando con 25% de multigrado y 75% de monogrado en el primer cambio de aceite, y aumentando progresivamente la cantidad de multigrado en los siguientes cambios.  <br>  <br>  Otra clasificación son los aceites minerales y los aceites sintéticos.  En los aceites sintéticos las moléculas que lo componen son idénticas, lo que permite una menor fricción entre ellas. Su temperatura de descomposición es mucho mayor pudiéndose extender el cambio de aceite hasta 4 veces el tiempo requerido para el aceite mineral. En la formulación  de los aceite sintéticos se utiliza un básico  conocido como PAO (Polialfaolefina) cuya naturaleza no polar obliga a a?adir otro aceite sintético (principalmente a base de esteres) para disolver los aditivos polares, pudiendo no ser compatible con algunos sellos/ empacaduras de vehículos anteriores a los a?os 88 por lo que pudiera ocasionar fugas de aceite en el motor. <br>  <br>  SAE significa society of Automotive Engeniers- sociedad de ingenieros automotrices.<br>  <br>  Las normas SAE (están indicadas en los envases) establecen grados de viscosidad en los aceites de los vehículos. Son 5 grados SAE verano, que clasifican a los aceites según su viscosidad a 100 grados centígrados: SAE 20, 30, 40, 50, y 60. De esta manera, a mayor grado SAE, será mayor la viscosidad del mismo. El más usual para motores en nuestro medio es el SAE 40.<br>  <br>  Estos grados SAE de verano nada nos dicen con respecto a la fluidez del aceite en frío. Entonces, se decidió establecer los grados SAE de invierno llamados SAE 0W, 5W, 10W, 15W, 20W y 25W, que aseguran que el aceite fluya en forma adecuada a bajísimas temperaturas. En este caso, a menor número SAE, más crudo el invierno en el cual puede funcionar el motor.<br>  <br>  Además se eliminan las posibilidades de que el lubricante frene al motor durante el arranque: si el aceite estuviera muy viscoso impediría el giro del mismo.<br>  <br>  Usando el correcto grado SAE permitimos que trabaje en forma más eficiente el "burro" de arranque, logramos que dure más la batería y podemos partir mucho más rápidamente.<br>  <br>  Los aceites que puedan cumplir con dos de estas clasificaciones se denominan Multigrados, y su formulación especial permite tener en caliente viscosidades más altas, y mucho más bajas en frío. Por ejemplo, un multigrado SAE 15 W-40 reduce a la mitad el tiempo de funcionamiento "en seco" de los árboles de leva a la cabeza, frente al Monogrado SAE 40 y a una temperatura tan moderada como 20 ?C (porque tiene la mitad de la viscosidad, es decir que fluye dos veces más rápido hacia los puntos críticos de la máquina). En una fría ma?ana de 0 ? C, que parece serán muchas estos meses, logra reducir ese período fatídico a una tercera parte, con evidente reducción del desgaste.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, a las altas temperaturas, por ejemplo 290?C, tiene un 25% más de viscosidad que el Monogrado, y eso significa que provee una película lubricante más resistente en la zona del aro superior del pistón.<br>  <br>  Se gana muchísimo en términos de protección y eficiencia del motor, y esto es definitivo para elegir a los Multigrado. Por ello son los lubricantes recomendados por los fabricantes, para todo tipo de motores de cuatro tiempos; pero esa afirmación será desarrollado en otro artículo|`|2642d2334c203fe33d0deec1faa5ff48aa	Asi rapidito te explico:<br>  <br>  Los monogrados trabajan con una sola viscosidad (grueso) a cualquier temperatura. Estos aceites ya practicamente son obsoletos, ya no se usan. Son los que vienen etiquetados asi:<br>  <br>  >SAE30<br>  >SAE40<br>  >SAE50<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  Los multigrados y sinteticos trabajan con diferentes viscosidades dependiendo la temperatura en que se encuentren. Vienen etiquetados asi:<br>  <br>  >SAE10w-40<br>  >SAE5w-50<br>  >SAE5w-60<br>  >SAE25w-50<br>  >SAE25w-60<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  Las siglas de estos aceites se "leen" asi, ejemplo:<br>  <br>  Aceite 25w-50<br>  <br>  Caundo el motor esta frio, se dice que el aceite tiene un grado de viscosidad "25". La "W" viene de Winter= Invierno/Frio.<br>  <br>  Con forme se va calentando el nivel de viscosidad aumenta hasta volverse mas grueso, y llegar al nivel "50".<br>  <br>  Cuando hace frio el aceite debe estar mas delgado para subir rapidamente por las venas de lubricacion, y volverse mas grueso al calentarse para proteger el motor a altas temperaturas.<br>  <br>  Te aburri???<br>  <br>  Suerte!!!
MDAsnqH0aa	Existe una mezcla que en teoria es la perfecta para el maximo rendimiento de la gasolina, esta se llama Mezcla Estequiometrica y significa que en condiciones normales, la combustión total de 1 gramo de gasolina se consigue con 14.8 gramos de aire. Sin embargo, los motores de pistón no son capaces de crear las condiciones de homogeneidad entre aire y gasolina para quemarla el cien por ciento. Para contrarrestar esta deficiencia los sistemas de alimentación están dise?ados de manera que la mezcla contenga un 10 por ciento más de aire por gramo de gasolina. Esta proporción se denomina "mezcla económica" y se forma con 16 partes de aire por cada parte de combustible, por lo que con 1 litro de gasolina consumiras 16 Lts de aire. esto solo aplica en motores de aspiracion normal.|`|GPdiM6Miaa	tu no te apures por eso, que consuma todo el aire que quiera, mientras no te cueste a ti.|`|fc3708ed4398a8b3afd57e2cdb827f83aa	La respuesta de Eduardo H es correcta<br>  <br>  Pero es mas sencilla de explicar<br>  <br>  La mezcla que requiere un auto para la combustion en los cilindros es efectivamente 16 partes de aire por 1 de combustible, el valor varia de acuerdo al tipo de motor, pudiendo llegar hasta 20 partes de aire por 1 de gasolina<br>  <br>  Son valores que actualmente se consideran dentro de parametros optimos<br>  <br>  Saludos y suerte|`|71a5a3a5e878dd7a682130c34475aef8aa	de pende del auto. en el mio es un litro por cada 3 millas|`|b174ee80bb1179bc7e4eb7056910ba15aa	cres que va a subir el precio del aire ?
B3vYgcDBaa	I have not dealt with Diamond before, but myself and a friend experimented with a cheap setup which hit crazy good. We used two 12 inch L5's in a ported box, a capacitor, and a 600 watt dual amp. Hard to believe but, for the amp being so cheap it sounded great. I would prefer the L5's personally just because, you can get warranties and their is a large range of wattage you can push to them. My favorite source is looking on a free national classified called "craig list". www.craiglist.com is where people from all regions post free ads and most likely their is a location close to your area. If you would like to purchase everything refurbished or new, I would prefer my favorite online source for audio equipment " Hifisoundconnection.com "- lots of great prices and discounts available. Hope I helped.

60FBuhyGaa	They can tell but it won't necessarily void your warranty. The dealer has to completely prove that your ecu modification completely and definitely caused the problem that arises. <br>  <br>  I have a moded ECU APR chip for a 2004 1.8T. The ECU is plugged into via the data port on the car, however it is rarely touched nor read when you bring the car in for service. At first I would hide the ECU by changing the program back to the original (keep reading).The ECU memory has enough memory to store two configurations: stock and the moded program. Usually the moded program is the hidden program that can be turned off via a secret code that you program in when you get the car ECU flashed.<br>  <br>  Even if you get a moded ECU, some dealers don't even care. I have serviced my vehicle at several audi dealerships and none have ever complained that the ECU voided anything. <br>  <br>  Even if they happen to reflash the ECU back to the original state, the programmer of the ECU (In my case APR) will guarantee about reflashing it back to what I paid for. <br>  <br>  I got my done a the 20k mile marker, and haven't looked back at it. I have had dealer service guys asking what I did to it, and I told them an ECU upgrade and they said it feels nice. The turbo will definitely spool more and you'll also see it on the tachometer. Also the engine will tend to sound a little bit lower. <br>  <br>  I have lost a little mileage, but that is nothing to what I have gained, the added horsepower (I think for the $$$ it gets you the most hp gain). I was going to stage II my audi, but just never got around to it.|`|QPdD7o8Maa	Your gas mileage will greatly be reduced.  I have chipped my 06' A4 and it went from 31 mpg highway to 26 maybe 27.  So if you can deal with that change also.   One thing I would wait until you have expired the warranty.  Also if you do go ahead make sure to replace the fuel pump.

eUbldFuOaa	check your fuses|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	Your dad showed her the coil or distributor wire connections. Like the one answer said start from the spark plug wires, (4-wires evenly spaced on the side and top part of the engine) follow those wires to a small round cap, (the distributor) the wires coming out of it is a plug in type connector, It that one unplugged? If not look at the center wire in between all four of the plug wires on the distributor, (coil wire) follow that center wire to a small black plastic looking box, (about 3 by 3") there is a plug in connector there check that one. It should be one of the two connectors that is unplugged OR maybe even pull out slightly to look unplugged but is laying close to each other so you may not see it right away.  I also did this to my 17 year old when he got bad grades in school so I made him take the bus, I know the bus bites,  his grades got real good after that.  What are you in for? Good luck Girl! check at these two spots, it is a 20-second job to do this disable it. There is also a IGN fuse they can pull, look for a black plastic box under the hood, open the cover, look under the cover for a IGN ( ignition )fuse location, if they took that one out then you will need one to re-install to get it going.<br>  Ps if you do drive it and they don`t see you doing it, when you get home just unplug it again.|`|yzZchHHTaa	Does it crank over?

ksFD7EoSaa	Any time you add that much boost to an engine, you had better plan on strengthening the bottom end of the engine. When you reach boost in excess of 12 lbs your asking a lot from your engine. Dual turbos can develop up to 30 lbs of boost and will grenade a stock engine. Just something to think about before you do it. Properly done, you could see an increase of 300 plus horse power but the cost could exceed $15,000.00 with engine modifications.

The older DB series is still a top name in brands and dominates the market. I actually had a pair in my old cavalier that ran me for about 3 years (got them used from a friend) and when I took it in to get an amp for the speakers, the guy told me that only one speaker was working, and I couldn't believe him.

This doesn't take the place of a title transfer. It's a way for seller to cover their back. <br>  <br>  It's not too late to sign one. You need the VIN# as well. Write down the date sold.

So if it was Lost in the Mail, then you need to apply for a duplicate title with REG 227 form and mark it "not received" so they don't charge you $18 for the duplicate.

Xzdyz8Kiaa	They may benefit you by actually decreasing the braking ability of the vehicle, making you less susceptible to locking up the brakes (as much as the ABS will allow, anyway).<br>  <br>  I realize this sounds contradictory to the mythical beliefs about drilled/slotted rotors, but the truth is they have less surface area, therefore will produce less braking power under the same force in all but extreme temperature situations. Their benefit is cooling and avoidance of brake fade under extreme conditions, conditions you will not experience while driving in snow, obviously.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question. Yes, they may theoretically help. I doubt you'll notice it though.|`|n3IQlhdFaa	Snow should have no effect on them..the reason they are drilled and slotted is to dissapate heat under hard braking..nothing more..nothing less..|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	If you're not going to race the Integra, is the extra cost really worth the "looks?"|`|DcUoZntOaa	i would say no. the more surface you can get the better.<br>  an OEM or good set  of a fuller solid rotors. i own a red 69 chevelle ss and have a lot of experience working for my cold climate. it's worth keeping as close to natural as you can. 396 vrooom...<br>  peace!
de45ca1499f4d0d18904bae45463c319aa	I agree with you that drilled and slotted rotors look awesome on an Integra, but I would strong advise against them especially in the winter.  The reason you see them on race cars is that they dissipate heat better, which is a concern when you are braking extremely heavily for an extended period of time.  However, it also reduces the surface area of your rotor.  For every day driving this is a bad thing and will reduce your cars ability to brake.  As cool as they are, they just simply aren't practical for a daily driver.  Stick with stock.|`|kFsviR9waa	Doesn't really matter if its winter time, Drilled and slotted rotors help dissipate heat so you don't get break fade as quick and better pads for example Hawk pads have a better bite which shorten breaking distances but give more dust which i dont really care about, performance is all that matters you can always wash your car

AA11288277	I don't think you could pin it down to one specific year...the automobile gradually phased out the horse and buggy, but it really started in the late 1910's and early 1920's.|`|rP4XkhUraa	I would guess somewhere between 1910 - 1920|`|K0YgJQgWaa	Automobiles began developing deferent models between 1913 - 1919 to suit peoples needs sizing and seating. However, the full mass production cycle of vehicles didnt take effect until between 1920s. So I would categorize between that time period is when horses and buggies started to phase out of the picture. Does that mean they were gone. No, not everyone could still afford a vehicle and were still using them at that time but not to a full extent. I would say by late 1920 - 1930 we were fully commited to using automobiles as a standard. There is no real defined year as to when it was replaced.<br>  <br>  "between 1900 and 1910 automobile manufacturing leaped from one hundred and fiftieth to twenty-first in value of product among American industries and became more important to the national economy than the wagon and carriage industry by all measurable economic criteria.<br>  "|`|AA11081968	It's hard to nail down a specific year but if i had to I would say 1908, because I believe that's the year that Henry Ford started to mass produce the Model T for the average working man.

It might be your fuel injector being corroded or dirty, that would lead to a non-uniform spray of gas into the engine, which leads to a bad fuel/air mixtures which would lead to a decrease in hp and torque. Also, look at your air filter, if its really dirty, i would replace it, since the dirt and grime will clog up the material, which leads to less air getting sucked into the engine and results in a loss of hp.|`|HizAP9Z8aa	If you have had the same fuel filter for 140,000 miles, it should probably be changed.  If you take your truck to an auto part store, they will usually plug it in and diagnose it for free.  That'll probably tell you the cause of the problem.  It could also be, among other things, an oxygen sensor or a TPS sensor.

Not being a jackass just realistic|`|2rLbUtqCaa	it will damage the subs if both the bass boost and the gain are turned up too loud, it also depends on on how many watts your amp is compared to your sub. if they match well, it shouldnt be a problem, like my 4ohm sub can handle all the gain and bass boost (12" l7 and zx750.1 amp).|`|UTGddhalaa	absolutely depending on the impedance of the speakers.  I would lay it easy on the BASS settings.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Not unless you turn it up too loud.  Gain is basically just a fancy word for volume on an amp.  It will make it easier for you to get into a situation where you've got the volume too loud though, especially right after you make the change.  Make sure you're a little conservative while you're getting used to it.|`|uL5772kCaa	Setting the gain too high will cause your amplifier to start clipping the signal. What that means, it means that the signal wave will start becoming more of a square rather than a nice smooth curve. That causes plenty of power increase (it can be 2x as much for a fully clipped signal) and that makes the speaker have mechanical problems and lead to blowing them. A gain knob is NOT the volume knob. It is a way to adjust the RCA volts to your amplifier's volts so your amplifier can perform at its best.

So yeah, low boost and driving it carefully will certainly help.<br>  <br>  No, the 2002 WRX and RS motors are not the same at all.  The block and heads are completely different.  The RS engine has an open block design, and the WRX is semi-closed.  Basically that mean the WRX block is much stronger (more small holes in the water jacket, instead of a few HUGE holes).  Except for the boxer layout those two engines are almost completely different.<br>  <br>  Getting a factory turbo engine is a great idea!  That will work beautifully.  Getting just the trubo?  What's the point?  You're still putting a turbo on an NA engine.<br>  <br>  Now, as for chipping it... That traditionally hasn't been a problem with the NA engine.  You won't make as much power either.  The NA block is generally "pretty good" under the 180-200 HP mark as long as you do a nice clean job with your mods.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is either do an engine swap (awsome option) or just buy a factory turbo.

2TgMqhxmaa	Let's just be clear: $600 for a 1985.5+ 944 in any condition with the engine is at least a decent deal for parts. I would tend to think, however, that this car you speak of needs a lot of other work for the seller to opt out of repairing the engine to instead dump the whole car as-is for a very low price.<br>  <br>  Expect to pay in the $1500 range for properly done work with labor. It's almost guaranteed there are bent valves and probably some damaged guides. I tend to doubt there are bent rods or much significant lower-end damage ... the valve stems, tappets or even cam carriers will fail well before rods and wrist pins, which are designed to transmit the kinetic energy of exploding gases into torque to propel a 3000 lb vehicle.<br>  <br>  This could be done for as cheap as around $500, but only if you remove/reinstall the head yourself with a new gasket, belts, blah blah; the only major cost then would involve having a shop rebuild the head for you.<br>  <br>  In any case, if you don't know much about the mechanical aspects of cars I'd have someone come out and look at it with you. If there is a lot wrong with it you have no idea what kind of hellish nightmare your life will become shortly after purchase.<br>  <br>  Having owned five 944-series cars of all flavors (and made mistakes), I can assure you the adage "there is no such thing as a cheap Porsche" is accurate.|`|154146d98d9dbb211223b05af3f8c0d5aa	I am sorry to report that the 944 engine is an "interference engine", meaning that when the timing belt broke, the piston hit at least a few of the valves. <br>  This may result in broken valve guide, cracked head, broken pistons or bent rods.<br>  If you are buying the car, just figure on adding the cost of a replacement engine.<br>   PS: A 944 is not some rare treasure, It is a front engine. rear wheel drive car that somebody drove until it broke.IF someone did not keep up with the timing belts, THEN they probably did not keep up with anything else. Good luck.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	If the car is in good shape, $600 would be worth it. Plan on much more than $500 in repairs though, even doing the work yourself. You'll most likely need a new head or some extensive machine work. You'll need to replace the pistons that made contact with the valves and most likely those rods as well. Rods can bend through normal wear and tear, hitting a valve doesn't help that cause. While you have the head off, you should look at the rod and main bearings, you'll need to take the pan off if a piston is bad anyway. You'll need some special loctite flange sealant if you take the bearings out, mcmaster-carr has it though. I did a bottom end on my car two summers ago and parts and the little machining that was done ran about $1700, that was with a 10% discount and no sales tax. We put the motor back together at my uncle's shop so there was no labor cost either. I didn't touch the head, you obviously need to as well as swap at least one piston out. Doing the work yourself, plan on $2200 easily. Look for a good motor you can swap in before rebuilding yours, it'll be much cheaper.|`|PSQvGW4Uaa	I think the prices people have been quoting you are fairly conservative, $2500-$3500 is probably going to be closer to what you'll pay. Who knows if the damage is limited to the valves only.  $600 will be fine if the you understand you're getting into a project that's going to be a lot of money.  Make sure the car is sound otherwise if you do.

7KKPcUpkaa	This depends on what you like, really. <br>  <br>  Here are a few differences.<br>  <br>  Front wheel drive vehicles are favorable to manufactures<br>  because they are cheaper to assemble. That's why most cars produced today are front wheel drive. <br>  Most sports car enthusiasts prefer rear wheel drive for a number of reasons:<br>               a: Purists like them because that's how the first sports cars <br>                   were. <br>               b: Under acceleration the vehicle weight is shifted toward the <br>                   rear of the vehicle, providing more traction and less wheel <br>                   spin.  <br>              <br>   If you are buying, then you should drive both. They have a slightly different feel to them. Which one is better is based on the needs of the driver, and preference.|`|SGjSk5WTaa	Front wheel if you live in somewhere were it snows because it gives you better traction.

I used to live up an old logging road you'd probably call a green, visitors would regularly lose mufflers and occasionally high-center full sized pickups, we even had to tow out a lifted Wrangler one time--it got high-centered axle-deep in a puddle.  I used to drive that road in a Honda Civic wagon, which would bottom out regularly, though I only got it stuck once.  You can handle these trails in a stock compact car if you pay attention and know what you're doing.  A stock Wrangler will have no problems unless you do something foolish.  <br>  <br>  I'd say the most important thing is to have your vehicle in decent running condition.  Don't go off-roading in a car that will leave you stranded on dry pavement.  Carry a tool kit, a winch or come-along, and a couple jugs of water.  Good tires and a spare are absolutely a must! <br>  <br>  Blue trails are a little more rugged, take things slow and use a spotter for anything you're not absolutely sure about.  It wouldn't hurt to add a lift kit, taller tires (pref. with double-walls and snow or mud tread), upgraded shocks--but I'm not sure if any of that is actually necessary.  Pick your lines well and you'll be ok.

They're misfiring and it won't ignite the fuel, so it sends it out in a big cough-hack out the exhaust.

2rLbUtqCaa	pick up the neon tubes for a auto parts store, or wherver you want, hook those up, then go to radio shack and buy a flip switch to control them of when you want them to turn on and off, then screw it under your dash, or on your main head dash. should be a sweet hook up, although ive never dealt with neons, so i couldnt tell you how to hook em up, but im sure they probably just hook onto your battery or somewhere.|`|PvlpJ1IFaa	ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  in almost all states, and the ones that aren't illegal they will be soon, it's illegal to have neon under your car unless its amber in front and orange on sides(just like semi's)<br>  <br>  if you really want to make them controled by a switch. where you can turn them on or off.

You can take your chances in court, but the "deck is stacked against you" in court. <br>   Tickets are really a racket to get money from the public.

bqLvWpcZaa	The biggest issue would be over-tightening the plugs and stripping the cylinder head spark plug holes.  However, without a torque wrench, this is not something you can check.  The post above is correct by stating that it is better to under-tighten as opposed to over-tightening the plugs.  If it's under tightened, the plug(s) may just work themselves loose and you will eventually loose power and possibly have the Check Engine Light come on.  The fix would simply be to retighten the plug.|`|AA12261615	you installed them the right way,if you unsure check the torque on them once they cool down,and go about a 1/8 of a turn more,but they should be fine like they are as long as they stay tight you wont have no problems from them and i hope you used something on the threads to make them easier to remove the next time,you should be alright with it,but recheck it just to be sure,if their gaped right and it runs well you did ok on changing them,good luck.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	For starters, I hope you used a little anti-sieze on the threads before<br>      you installed them.

Most<br>      people tend to over-tighten them too much. For peace of mind, you<br>      can always borrow a torque wrench or pop off the plug boot (now that the engine has reached operating temp ) and give them all just<br>      a bit "torque"  to check that they have seated properly.<br>  <br>       Good Luck to you|`|2ZkIiPA3aa	Tightening is not really an issue. You dont have to worry about any kind of tourque specs with a spark plug (even if they exist) all you need to do is ease them down under medium strength until it becomes tight and stops turning.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing with a spark plug is making sure the gaps are perfect.

qmn6c64Laa	first off, is the pizza hut sign on the same line as your lighter? if so,then it could be a bad power wire...maybe grounding out somewhere...try a separate power feed to the lighter, and see if that solves the problem...if not, then try a new lighter socket...the socket itself does need to be grounded, but it should ground  itself just by being inserted into place using the frame of the body as a ground...but a ground wire would be a good way to be certain it is grounded...or try another power source in your fuse box, or even a direct feed to your battery to troubleshoot...hope this helps...  :)   cheers|`|yzZchHHTaa	Take it out and replace it with a new one from an autoparts store.

gsjjiRGFaa	to answer your question honestly, vws are quite decent cars. this does NOT put them in a reliability class anywhere near, say, a honda or toyota, but decent. you WILL spend a bit more time in the shop, and more money on each visit. look carefully for your vdub & just plan for any mishaps, for there will be some. upon purchase, get yourself a robert bentley manual covering your car to keep yourself aware for when you visit the shop.|`|EmgiGg17aa	I love you guys that ask about the length of time the car will last, and yet do not tell what kind of driver you yourself are(is)?<br>     What can I say?

BYm9KzQvaa	If you are sure there are no leaks from the wheel cylinders or the brake lines, your master cylinder needs an overhaul. The oil is leaking through from one side to other other, instead of putting pressure onto the wheel cylinders. One likely cause is age, another is using the wrong (or mixed) types of brake fluid. <br>  <br>  I know brakes are the most important part for safety, but I realise money might be an issue. If you have the tools, you can try buying an overhaul kit. OR you may be able to pick up a matching master cylinder from a newer model Tempo at a wrecker's yard. Ring around first and take the old one with you. The new one must be identical. <br>  <br>  Air in the system tends to pulsate or give uneven braking, not make the pedal sink.  If you can force the pedal to the floor with the engine OFF (no air boost) it is definitely the master cylinder.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Does the pedal pump up if you rapidly pump the brakes?

AA10164889	Fixed-wing airplanes cannot remain in place in the air, even for a second.

Also if you can, check the voltage regulator, it could be that the voltage reg. is going out, so the alternator might stop charging since it thinks it doesnt need to.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	<a href="http://www.camryforums.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">http://www.camryforums.com/forum/</a><br>  <br>              Justin, Try this site...these folks are pretty good with<br>              Camry technical issues.<br>  <br>               You still haven't mentioned if any dash lights are on<br>                before, during your episodes of car failure.<br>  <br>               You should really get yourself a set of jumper cables, and<br>                a friend to follow you for a nice long ride but not too far<br>                away from your mechanic.<br>  <br>                By the amount of times you've posted this question, this<br>                issue must really be driving you nuts.

fZjgIE9Baa	First off, college. Not all airlines require a degree. Several of the "regional" airlines don't require a degree. However, most of the "majors" do. So where do you want to end up? Charter flying and other corporate flying has a policy on a per-company basis. But if you have it, it may put you ahead of someone who doesn't.<br>  <br>  Air Force.  You'll be committed to them for no less than 10 years. Are you prepared to devote that time? Not to mention you'll be IN the military and may have to deploy, fight, and possibly pay the ultimate sacrifice. It may be for you, it may not.<br>  <br>  If you do choose college, then the question is do you chose an "aviation university" or not. Aviation Universities include Embry Riddle, Auburn University, along with many more. OR, you can choose to attend an "airline academy" which will be independent of a 4 year degree but will have you ready from start to ready for an airline interview in XX number of days/months.  These include Delta Connection Academy <br>  <br>  Anyway, to be competitive for a regional airline right now you will ultimately need (in terms of flight experience) your Commercial Multi Airplane license with an Instrument rating at probably AT LEAST 800 hours of flight time of which at least 100 hours should be in a multi-engine airplane.<br>  <br>  If you go to one of the academy's be prepared to spend around $25,000 up front (or within a few months) to get that commercial multi.... Other wise, if you obtain the licenses/ratings as you go the following will become familiar terms to you:<br>  -- Private Pilot License<br>  -- Instrument Rating<br>  -- Commercial License<br>  -- Multi-Engine license/add-on<br>  -- Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)<br>  -- Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII)<br>  -- Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI)<br>  -- Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI)<br>  <br>  I would also recommend www.aopa.org to investigate learning to fly.

The 1/2, 3/4. and 1 ton mean nothing anymore as any of the trucks will carry considerably more than that.

This is for the safety of pedestrians so they dont accidentally get clipped by a bike going past. Although they are allowed to dismount and walk their bike across obviously. I've never seen a toucan crossing so Im not sure why a cyclist is allowed to cycle across them. I believe they are wider than a standard crossing so as to minimize the safety issue. I can only assume toucan crossings occur on cycle and pedestrian paths (For example: A large park that has a main road going through it)

fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	If you look on kbb.com you can find the value for the model you're looking at. 85,000 miles is not bad at all on a Subaru. It should go well over 300,000 miles before it even hints at giving out.<br>  <br>  The information below was copied from the site listed:<br>  <br>  Because you never know what’s on the road ahead, Subaru engineers developed Subaru All-Wheel Drive, a system that not only is capable of powering all four wheels, but also automatically varies the amount of power sent to each wheel at all speeds. The result is a vehicle that’s remarkably steady on the road under virtually all weather and driving conditions.<br>  Decades of development by Subaru have led to a system with no buttons to push or levers to engage – it operates without driver intervention. Subaru All-Wheel Drive automatically adjusts power to each wheel to provide the best traction. Subaru All-Wheel Drive automatically transfers power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip – this translates into enhanced control and traction when things get wet and slippery. But it also helps improve overall performance even when the pavement is bone dry.<br>  <br>  For example, when you brake hard, weight shifts forward, reducing rear traction. Or if you step on the accelerator, the opposite is true. And in a curve, the vehicle dynamics are constantly changing. Subaru All-Wheel Drive varies the amount of power sent to each wheel at all speeds. So whether you’re braking, accelerating or cornering, on dry pavement, mud or snowy roads, traction is there when you need it, with decades of Subaru design and development behind it.|`|AA12095978	the subaru system has all 4 wheels spinning, unlike most other "AWD" systems that spin when they're needed, if they even do that.<br>  <br>  major drawback to the subaru system, while it's a very good system, it doesn't like having to run out of unison.<br>  So it boils down to tire tread.  if you have 1 tire that has lower tread than another, you are stressing the system. If you have 2 tires in front the same and 2 in the back the same tread, you're stressing the system.<br>  So constant tire rotations is the only thing that'll help keep the transfercase happy.<br>  Ford Explorers with AWD have the same issue.|`|AA12132613	In every Subaru the AWD is at all times. It doesn't matter what condition it is. Even the old models have it too.

TdrgZwnoaa	If the bus has normal or ABS hydraulic brakes you do not require a special license for personal use. All that goes out the window if you have air brakes.<br>  <br>   If you are going to be the primary drivers I would recommend going to your local school bus operator and take a few runs with one of their instructors. This is not mandatory; just good sense. Some of these people will do this for you privately for a minimal fee.<br>  <br>   If you are running electrical appliances in the unit they have to meet State/Provincial code for wiring and circuit protection. And the appliances should be properly secured to the floor of the bus ( IMPORTANT ! )<br>  <br>   If you are running propane (recommended) contact your local RV Dealer. I won't even pretend to have a clue about propane installs.

AA12261615	that may be in the thickness of the oil your using in it,as it warms up it gets thinner and makes the oil pressure return more to a normal stage,that can also be caused by a bad oil pump pressure relief valve and it will do this as it gets older,the only way to correct it if that's it is to replace the oil pump,and that can also be caused by a bad sending unit but on a bad sending unit when they get hot the oil pressure usually drops to near nothing,if your using a thicker oil that could be a big part of the problem,id try changing the oil and see if that helps it,one of my trucks will do this when it gets about 3 thousand on an oil change,and after changing it, it returns to normal for a few thousand then it does it again,good luck with it.|`|AA12095978	what brand oil filter are you using?

0ODpTZsaaa	Could be timing or something wrong with the fuel. Sometimes if you timing is off real bad the car wont start at all...|`|AA11766020	Well There's a lot of things it could be but, If the truck ran before this condition I would rule out timing.  Yes, the timing belt could have slip or even broke, but if that were to happen then you'd have backfires while trying to start the vehicle. You say you have fuel, but do you know how many PSI? Another thing to look for is the ground that runs from the PCM to the frame of the vehicle. If you can't find any grounds loose I would go find a person that has a Scan tool that can connect to your truck's Data Link Connecter.  This will tell you if there are any diagnostic codes available for more information on why the vehicle won't start. The last thing I would like to know is how do you know there's spark? Many unexperienced techs don't know that firing a spark plug from a spark plug wire doesn't take much when the plug isn't under compression. In order to correctly test your ignition system, I would get a spark plug wire tester and make sure all the wires fire the tester.

First of all sound travels so my good friend here is what to do .<br>  <br>  You need a  wooden round stick which is some 18 inches long . Mostly these sticks they sell them for a broom . If you can get one cut to the size I have quoted . Next switch youe engine on and put one end of this stick to your ear . with the other end start by touching it ro the engine .. At intervals move it but keep it touching the engine . Dont worry the sound will tell you were it is as you are scanning . When an engine emits sounds, this is not something for any one to start shooting ideas . Yet from what you are stating this sound could be coming from either the big ends or the small ends . The big ends are the white metal shells which are fitted on the bearing that clamps around the crank shaft . The small ends are the same thing and these are fitted to the conrod which has the piston .  You could also have piston slap meaning that the bore which the piston travels up and down is worn down . Well , you need a lot of tools and know how  to fix this problem .You do not state milage ??  looks like your engine needs an over haul .
de45ca1499f4d0d18904bae45463c319aa	You weren't crazy for buying it, the 600RR is an amazing bike and one of the best for the money.  I've ridden a Honda CBR for years and I love it.  Also that bike sits pretty low, if you can't touch the ground with both feet on a 600RR it's unlikely that you would have a much easier time on any other sports bike.  Having only one foot down really isn't a huge deal.  As far as power, that's a pretty fast bike for a starter.  I have a few friends that started on CBR 600s who are fine now but most prefer to start on a 250 or something.  If you are worried about your safety you should sell it and get something slower rather than risking your life, but considering you have already put 500 miles on your bike it sounds like you're doing just fine.  The more you ride the more comfortable you will get with the bike and the slower it will feel.  Good luck!|`|Ict5JA4eaa	well you were crazy for buying a honda. lol. but no riding bikes are fun. just dont feel the need to push on the throttle every time you have the chance. but if you cant resist and it still scares you to get on, then you should just sell it =x dont want to be afraid of something that cost you however many dollars and not even have fun on it because your always worrying, right?|`|jo0ZHqFjaa	I had a good laugh reading your question.

uFQFRdczaa	People were  dusting off their 90 Geo Metros and Honda CRXs when gas was around $4.   U.S. consumption of gas dropped starting in August.  Then the markets crashed--not just in the U.S., but in Europe and Asia as well.  People in China and India quit buying so much gas--worldwide demand just slumped.  When that happened, investors (who'd been hoping for $13 a gallon) saw they weren't going to get it and pulled out.  This all happened at the same time as several refineries finished the upgrades they started after Katrina and Rita--so our fuel production was at an all time high just as demand started to fall.<br>  <br>  Now we're seeing oil go down at the same time gas is going up.  This is because our refineries are shutting down production--they can't make much money when gas is below $2 a gallon.  So it's all supply and demand in the end.  But to some extent, there's a psychological effect on oil investors--George W. was the oilman's friend, his policies promoted high oil prices and record oil company profits.  With him out of officet, investment in oil seems like less of a guaranteed moneymaker.|`|907e3984a6f4f92078cc488022d7399daa	Demand for oil reduced, and investors took their money somewhere else, thus, the price of oil crashed.  Lower oil price = lower gas price at the pump.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	We have the dollar tied into this thing called the oil standard.<br>  <br>  OIl goes up, so does the dollar.<br>  <br>  Oil plummets, so does the dollar.<br>  <br>  The above angle about investors and speculators affects crude oil futures as well.<br>  <br>  It's NOT just supply and demand.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, oil prices would stay low forever as there is more than enough oil in the ground, though getting to it is the challenge..
u2ubQK3Yaa	Its a State Law.<br>  <br>  In Michigan any DOT approved helmet. Full, 3/4 , half, it doesnt matter.<br>   I presume all states are the same.<br>  ---Now hang on because people will start giving opinions and not answering your question.|`|t2rUhyANaa	No. As long as the helmet has DOT approval, it is legal.<br>  <br>  Full-face helmets offer better protection, but not for the reasons previously stated: <br>  <br>  People who claim you can hit the pavement at 60mph don't understand physics. In fact when you fall, the force of the vertical impact of your face against the pavement is exactly the same whether you are moving at 60mph or standing still. The difference is that if you are moving you risk having your head dragged along the asphalt. This will definetely damage your good looks, but it won't tear your jaw off.<br>  <br>  If you hit the back of a landrover hard enough to end-up against the gear shift lever there's a real good chance that you were going too fast for the circumstances. What you need is not a better helmet, but a better common sense.|`|3pIWS4J3aa	I believe it does not matter what style motorbike helmets you wear just as long as it is D.O.T approved! And there are plenty of different styles that are D.O.T approved  as seen here <a href="http://www.motorbikehelmets4less.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.motorbikehelmets4less.com</a>|`|0g2fDpUbaa	AFAIK there is no state where they mandate the type of helmet worn, excepting the fact it must be DOT certified.  This is assuming you live in the USA.  I have no clue what the laws may be in other countries.|`|ttbXQEJ8aa	I know of no state that requires a full face helmet. <br>  <br>  Technically riding with face shield open could be viewed as riding without eye protection.|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	No and no.<br>  Go with DOT approved.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	Whether its law or not think about this,<br>  <br>  You hit the tarmac at 60mph chin first,what would you rather have?A messed up full face helmet or your face ground away by the road surface?<br>  <br>  I've seen a good friends jaw ripped OFF because he chose an open faced helmet.<br>  <br>  <br>  I always used a full face lid and it saved my not so good looks when i hit a Landrover at 55mph,the idiot reverse into my path I went through the rear door face first and smacked my face off of the gear lever,the visor on the helmet saved my eyesight on the left side as thats where the point of impact was.Without the full face lid and visor the gear knob might have punched right through into the brain.|`|AJmCHSwmaa	I can't imagine there's any difference in the law about full helmet or not. In Illinois where I live there is no helmet law, totally varies state to state. If you google states helmet laws you should find your answer
hhWDHmfyaa	A rather dubious friend of my husband's does this in San Francisco, Denver and Las Vegas.  He has avoided tickets for it, but tells us that if caught, he would get a ticket and the camper towed.<br>  <br>  He moves it everynight that he is in town.  He basically had a seriously bad marriage with a spouse who got him in deep trouble with the State of CA Tax Board.  So, now he refuses to be trackable.<br>  <br>  Also, when we were young my husband and I lived on a sailboat for two years while we sailed around the Pacific. It was fine while we were on the ocean or touring a port.  Living without a full bathroom, shower and kitchen takes its toll.  Good luck.

Qz8SB9bOaa	My elderly neighbour had the same problem for months.  Some selfish pig kept parking across her driveway because "there was no-where else to park". Complaints to police were useless.  In fact she was told that she had no automatic right to have her drive kept clear and if people chose to leave it clear it was only out of courtesy and there was basically nothing she could do about it.<br>  <br>  One night out of desperation she went out with a stanley knife and slashed all his tyres and waited in all next day expecting to be arrested.<br>  <br>  Nothing happened and nothing was ever said, but the following morning the car was gone and it was never parked there again!|`|DvWGTzLUaa	In the highway code, dropped kerbs are on a "Do Not Park" list.... But its not on the "Must Not", which I believe  means its not a law... But if talking isn't helping, wait until someone parks there again and call your local police station and ask them to send someone along to have a word if poss. Or write up a letter explaining your issues and how it is affecting your access and put it through the offending neighbours letterboxes. Unfortunately its just poor driver etiquette.|`|XJqHuHLiaa	there is no legal restriction if you have no lines painted, altho the highway code is just a guide. sounds like your neighbours have no manners or at all courteous of any sorts. the police could help in offering a friendly word to them, as a tax payer they have an obligation if you make a request.|`|5I4imquJaa	ring the police   (not 999 or 911)<br>  <br>  its classed as an obstruction/nuisance<br>  <br>  <br>  same thing is happening with my mum at the mo, she lives in a corner house and they keep parking so she cant get in or out....<br>  <br>  police told my mum to take photos etc for evidence, just make sure you dont get faces|`|1evqSw67aa	They are not allowed to park in front of your drop kerb,nor are you drop kerbs have to be kept clear.<br>  Just phone up your local council parking pffices they will send someone round to place a parking fine on their car ￡80 I believe that would deter them<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ieTOMSbWaa	Its illegal as long as you got permission off the council to drop the kerb. Report it to the police and/or get the council to come out and they will put a white line in front of it to help the thick fools that cannot see it?|`|f6ae2bf2ebd4ad49b32dea3818324e4caa	they are obstructing your driveway, phone the police and they will have the car towed.<br>  dont bother trying to speak to the neighbour again the look on their face when the car is on the back of a truck will be priceless.|`|iRXraQWyaa	It is an offence to park across a drop down curb which leads into a drive.  Ring the police.  They can send round a Community Officer to talk to your neighbours if you have not been successful.|`|6507eb67b40c198c7f9e69ac4296c97faa	Having a dropped kerb entitles you to unrestricted access to your driveway on your property, so your neighbours are in the wrong.|`|0fb4589d7d6babcc79f63404f6039751aa	complain to your local council, call the police.<br>  No they are not allowed to park across your driveway, it`s "obstruction".<br>  Get a wheel clamp and charge them ￡100 to remove it !|`|r5zbM9HGaa	If anything is causing an obstruction to yourself, ask your local police dept, they will issue a ticket or even remove it under police powers for the offence.....that will stop em...|`|AA11366224	Next time it happens, call the police.

3e22b1a7792d3f8ae360a8cdf87f2335aa	We're told the One-77, which uses a carbon-fiber chassis, will utilize an all-aluminum body that's completely hand crafted. From the shadowy figure released by Aston's PR office, the car looks somewhat similar to current Astons, albeit with a more muscular stature.<br>  <br>  Like the rendering, much of the car's details also lurk in the shadows. Aston Martin says the One-77 will use a 7.0-liter V-12, which we hear may produce close to 600 hp. Rumor has it the car will achieve a 0-62 mph time in four seconds and a top speed of over 200 mph - placing the One-77 squarely in super car territory.<br>  <br>  Of course, the power and prestige comes at an expense - a price tag rumored to be over 1 million, which converts to somewhere around $1.9 million. There's no word on if the car will come stateside, but if you're seriously hoping it does, you may want to hit the car's website at www.one-of-77.com and start contacting Aston's salespeople.

csmEH6qsaa	Simple answer:<br>  Ships have to be big enough to carry boats, and boats have to be small enough to be carried by ships. <br>  <br>  Ships when referring to sailing vessels, a ship is a square-rigged craft with at least three masts, and a boat isn't. <br>  Ship when referring to power driven vessels, a large vessel intended for oceangoing or at least deep-water transport, and a boat is anything else. <br>  <br>  There are exceptions - some large vessels are referred to as boats such as Submarines, Great Lakes freighter, the riverboat, and the ferryboat. <br>   <br>  Good Luck - Boat Safe!|`|BzUMSGgwaa	if they are big enough to actually do shipping e.g carry boats n other big goods, and are used to "ship" things from one country to another, then its a ship!<br>  xxx

These transmission have a tendency to fail. What fails is the "SUN" gear. The transmission should be in limp home mode once the sun gear has failed. In limp home mode the transmission will only shift at a high rpm and you will only be able to go so fast. You will generally not have a reverse gear and you will also hear the tranmission whine. With in 89,000 miles on my 99 GMC Jimmy. I have had 2 transmission replacements. One that I paid for ($1300) and the second one was on warrantee. Best of luck.
a47cAPypaa	Firstly spray the scratch with undercoat before it starts to rust, if rust has already started then rub down with fine wet & dry paper (600) and cover with undercoat. When you are ready to treat the damaged  area you will need some cellulose body filler which is available premixed. Again you will need the 600 wet & dry rubbing paper, spray on undercoat, and top finish matching colour. Gently rub down the scratch to give an even finish, apply the cellulose filler and allow to harden, rub down with 600 paper to give a feathered effect on damaged area, use 1000 paper to finish off, then spray with undercoat, then spray with topcoat. To finish off when paint has hardened rub down with a fine compound & the polish.|`|esdwsdwHaa	It depends on what you are trying to achieve, if all you want is to stop it from rusting then just touch it up with some primer and then the color, which you can find at automotive stores.

Take it to a body shop and ask them about it and let the professionals advise you|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	cheep?..diy?...<br>  go to a car shop,auto paint place...get them to mix you up a ''paint pen'' to the colour of your car...￡5 cheep enough for a student?<br>  <br>  older paint pens were simply small brushes,these days there are as thin as a biro pen so any scratch can be filled/built up with paint in no time...sorted.
JXWC0fxPaa	You will be going against traffic (sort of). I would take Wilshire east to Figueroa and turn left. Just remember that just about every street in downtown LA is one-way. Fig is one way going north. Give yourself 30 minutes to make the trip.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|AA10857166	If there's a train along this route you are better off travelling by train.|`|6Gfz125Paa	METRO LOCAL LINE 18 bus will be perfect for you.
AA10643879	4R70W transmission has problem with forward clutch drum broken around snap ring grooves,only with late model (04 and up)though.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	My 2004 Ford lariat did almost the same thing they had to replace a torque converter and the transmission. Wasnt happy. the cold shouldnt really affect your truck but then again it is a Ford.|`|lIxEKA1xaa	probably blew the torque converter one way clutch in it. OR for some reason something froze inside the tranny, but shouldnt of cuz they can handle colder then that. the cold can do some crazy things though. but probably torque converter is bad, needs new one. about 400-800 bucks for it i believe. but does it actually go in reverse too. then clutch packs or valvles could be bad or just frozen
AA11435704	Just as you can not be forced to buy a car from a dealer, the dealer can not be forced to buy a car from you, Until the deal is finalized, there is no binding contract. What most likely happened is the dealer had a customer for a car like yours. Either the customer or the dealer found a car elsewhere. <br>  <br>  You made plans base on the dealer buying your car, but the dealer decided not to do so. Any losses suffered are not the fault of the dealer, but of you for spending money before you actually sold the car.<br>  <br>  If I had a dollar for every customer who said that they would be in to buy a car and never showed up, I would be able to retire.|`|mKVFIklaaa	You can't do anything: No contract was signed, you have made the classic error of 'counting your chickens before they're hatched';<br>  Don't start spending any money that you haven't yet seen!|`|86907ad9cce026f929aa1445843edac4aa	you  have been naive and trusting im afraid.<br>  <br>  it is a lesson  that you wont forget and you wont make the same kind of mistake again<br>  <br>  not everybody plays fair im sorry to say<br>  <br>  business is a jungle you have learned<br>  <br>  good luck in the future|`|eK5QBP6gaa	well sorry but you carnt really do anythink its like this you carnt make some one buy it from you if i was you i would sell it on ebay and hope you get a bit more and tell them to pick it up!!!<br>   or i seen this other site on the tv yesterday webuyanycars.com or .co.uk try it  good luck|`|nse6yRh2aa	Unfortunately, without an actual contract of sale, there's not much you can do.  At least you can complain whereby warn others off.  Call & talk to your insurance company they can  give you some advice.|`|aSs0tfjUaa	The only thing you can do is learn from this. No deal is done until the money is in your hand.|`|G2vRnUEkaa	You could inform the guy at the supermarket about it? And even the ticket person at the train station and the guy in the pub.<br>  You could go and get a hair cut and tell the hair dresser and they'll also listen to you if you get a cab.<br>  <br>  Oh and how did you manage to pay tax on the other car if you have no log book, no insurance, no mot for it.|`|ZWxyyxfRaa	Hi I am sorry but there are very few car dealers that are to be trusted You could take him to the small claims court.  What I did when my friend had a problem was We had someone phone the dealer saying they were a solicitor and the problem seemed to get sorted fairly quickly.|`|S6grX41qaa	I am sorry for your awakening day but sooner or later it was going to happen. I still remember mine back in 1986|`|Ag4RdBQJaa	That's ok, this will serve you as a lesson for next time.<br>  <br>  Next time you will not assume that you have sold the car until you have actually got the money in your pocket and the log book is signed up and sent off and the person has disappeared into the horizon with your car and 3 more days have passed.<br>  Note waiting 3 more days after the chap took your car away, because  oftentimes they WILL change their mind THE DAY AFTER.<br>  <br>  The other thing:<br>  <br>  Next time you will NOT pay tax for the other car, arrange train fare etc etc until you have the full money in your pocket and the things above have actually happened.<br>  This is ALSO so you don't WASTE other people's time messing them about with promises that you'll buy their car when in actual fact you don't have the money to buy their car.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, just learn from this, it is you entering the  adult world, where you buy cars, sell cars etc etc, wait till you discover what WOMEN can  do to yooou!|`|qvqh2puXaa	I sold a Y reg (2001) Ford Fiesta Flight to a garage recently and feel that I was ripped off.  He gave me ￡500 for the car as it was due an MOT and road tax.  Silly me thinking he wasn't going to sell it for any more than ￡1000, but I passed the garage and discovered that he was looking for ￡1600.<br>  <br>  On that basis, I think he is the sort of garage I wouldn't want to buy a car from as I don't think my Fiesta is worth as much as he wants to sell it for.<br>  <br>  I have only 2 or 3 dealers who I feel have been good with me when it's come to buying cars.  It just so happens that when I want to buy a car, I potentially have an 800 mile round trip.  Though I may be able to ask a friend to look at the car for me and test drive it.<br>  <br>  What I think you should have done was used your car as a trade in and use it towards a deposit for your new car.
