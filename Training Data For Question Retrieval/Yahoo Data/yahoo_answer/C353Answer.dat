fc66f5bf1cdbc8843a41603581ad3585aa	It Wasn't Me" !!!!!!!!!!    is a 2000 number one hit song by reggae artist Shaggy, featuring Ricardo "Rikrok" Ducent.    The song was originally never intended to be released as a single, MCA Records wanted "Dance and Shout" to be the first single released from the Hot Shot album and didn't offer other tracks to DJs. Hawaiian DJ Pablo Sato downloaded the album from "a Napster-like MP3 site he wont name" and discovered it "was the albums standout cut." He played the song on the radio the next day. "The phone lines lit up right away. Within a couple of days, it was our number-one requested song  (Yo man) Yo   (Open up man) What do you want man?

FPDr6Swqaa	El talk show de Laura Bozzo ha quedado fuera de la televisin peruana luego de que una serie de panelistas falsos desfilara por diversos programas, confesando su burda participacin en Laura en accin, y tras la presin que ejercieron diversas instituciones en proteccin del respeto al televidente, ATV decidi lsuspender el polmico espacio, una medida que se vea venir despus de tanta crtica hacia la polmica conductora y su programa.        http://www.noticias24.com/medios/?p=227|`|cHQwct5Gaa	Gano el juicio.

Por lo que se, ella queria hacer un programa en argentina con moria casan pero no se pudo, y ahora se encuentra en peru.    con lo que respecta a su denuncia, el abogado fredy escobar rozas en el programa de bayly se comprometio a defender legalmente gratis a los panelistas falsos (en especial menores de edad) por haberse manchado su imagen (en el caso d los ni?os esto tiene mucha relevancia dado que, aunque estos ni?os hayan dado su consentimiento o no para actuar en el programa y sea o no verdadero el caso (por ejemplo haber sido violados o acosados sexualmente) aun asi esos ni?os tienen derecho a una reparacion economica.    t recomiendo q veas en youtube el video fredy escobar rozas y jaime bayly.    este abogado la va denunciar en estados unidos, porque ahi se ubica telemundo (quien produjo el programa) y actualmente se encuentra en proceso.

V8ur2QMTaa	The way I see it.  Miley Cyrus is a teenage girl.  She takes stupid pictures, sings songs, and falls for boys.  Except for the fact that she is a Disney Star.  Her music is okay.  When I found out about her and Nick Jonas that probably triggered my past hatred.   I think about it know and realize the stupidity.  She seems nice and funny.  Im not a fan, or a hater.|`|KB6JsOVtaa	i like her show. she can act but i dont think she can sing. she is overrated. but whatever, that girl makes 4 million dollars a year at age 16. i cant hate. get that money girl. she better milk it for all she can cuz its not gonna last long|`|Ko42UftWaa	i think she's a 'bich' '****' 'whore' 'leso' and much more but i love her show........Hannah Montana the show ROCKS    xD|`|dqE24Rq4aa	I personally think she's a waste of air time and publicity.

Honestly, I don't hate her and I  don't love her. I think her voice is okay(putting aside the fact that it is  pretty husky) , but I really don't like her trashy  music.  She's not  hideous, but she isn't stunning either. Like I said, she's just another 15- year old. I'll watch her show if there's nothing else to watch.|`|GkPSvPhsaa	shes great altho she is trying abit too hard on the rockstarr thing but if she found her own style she will be greater than she already is.  and her pics well to me there fine its called art people hello|`|i4tJWaVeaa	she's ok..... but i dont think she should go contry she over sang at the cmt awards and it didn't sound good at all!

Sincerely I worry about the quality since they fit everything on 6 DVD (eg: Disc 1 runs at almost 4 hours...)    By checking the length of the movies you should be able to compare with imdb/wikipedia and see if they cut something.    Now, I've also found this 28 DVD box  http://www.kaboodle.com/reviews/studio-g...  but some movies have no English sub...and  (I think it's expensive)

6lYE2kpmaa	l no es un ni?o, no lo traten como ni?o porque van a crear codependencia.  Vos no sos la mam.  Apoy a tu mam, no a l.  Cuando l vea menos apoyo, menos manipulador ser.  Si quiere dinero para el vicio, que trabaje.  El alcoholismo, si bien es una enfermedad, pues la tendencia se localiza en el hipotlamo, la unica cura es no darle alcohol al organismo; pero se requiere de la voluntad del paciente para que la recuperacin sea ms rpida.    En Alcohlicos Annimos, tiene el lema de SLO POR HOY, que es muy efectivo.  En el caso de tu hermano, lamentablemente, est pasando momentos muy fuertes que lo conducen a eso precisamente, el alcohol.  Sera bueno que tus padres se sienten a hablar con l y le hagan ver sus responsabilidades por su edad.  Ya perdi lo ms preciado, sus hijos y su esposa, por el alcohol.  No tiene trabajo, pero s tiene dinero para comprar alcohol.  Entonces, que se haga cargo de su nica compa?a que es el alcohol.  Esto suena duro, pero es necesario hacrselo ver, con toda la autoridad del caso, porque de otra manera, el alcohol no slo lo arrastra a l, sino al ncleo familiar.  Es ms, yo tengo una filosofa con mis hijos, una vez fuera de la casa, no hay retorno.  ?Qu hace tu hermano en la cas de tus padres...?  Enfrntenlo con sus responsabilidades, el alcohol no es la solucin.  Orintenlo de manera que l quiera buscar la ayuda y lo mejor, considero, es ir a Alcohlicos Annimos.

Como lo hemos platicado, la unica forma de que controle totalmente su situacion es si el lo desea, si el tiene la voluntad de hacerlo, de mantenerse sin tomar, pero desafortunadamente creo que el no ha llegado al punto de decidir realmente dejar el alcohol. Tu has hecho cuanto has podido para apoyarlo, para darle los medios que lo hagan mejorar y para animarlo, pero no puedes hacer ya mas si el no lo desea.   He escuchado muchos buenos comentarios acerca de los grupos AA, pero esto tampoco funcionara si el no entiende que tiene un problema y que necesita mantenerse firme para salir de l.   No se si funcionara y si hay posibilidades de hacerlo pero creo que podra ser bueno si sus hijos hablan con el en un peque?o ratito que este sobrio, decirle que a todos afecta con ese vicio, que desean verlo recuperado, que desean que este sano, que desean que este bien, tal vez algo as le de motivacion.  Tal vez sea dura pero creo que tu ya no debes resolverle las cosas, el debe entender y enfrentar las consecuencias, darse cuenta de que es un problema de l y no tuyo y que solo el puede resolverlo.   Deseo que tengas la tranquilidad de sobrellevar estos momentos y que el tenga la luz para recapacitar y hacer lo necesario para recuperarse.  Te mando un fuerte abrazo.
EhBF31evaa	And then you have to ask yourself, why do people post stupid, ignorant questions?  (And I am not talking about your question - it is a logical question) but some of the questions on here are beyond stupid.  But, to answer your question, maybe they do want to post their opinion but I think it's mostly for the points.|`|ItraCEBnaa	yeah, points....and they just like posting their opinion to see if others think its funny or agree|`|T1uS2o2Qaa	Sometimes I will answer a question because no one responds....sometimes I go back 3 or 4 days and look for questions that no on replied....I don't reply with garbage, but my answers are at least an attempt to acknowledge someone..And if you are looking for REAL answers, if the person lied to you and she said she had 15 years of experience, would you have believed her? I take every answer here with an idea and some hope. I never accept someone's word are absolute truth without at least doing some investigating on my own....If you think all the answers are to be treated with the magic wealth of knowledge... think again  |`|AA10937948	they are for points|`|u1BX2aw0aa	Because that's what Polls & Surveys is all about.|`|CDbRdVgDaa	They want the points.|`|a31cdf7afacff801a05aee8c384030f6aa	YAY!!!

I mean there's still Max and everybody else. And Craig's just as good as Ronnie. Ronnie did what he did and faced the consequences.    EDIT: Chill, I wasn't calling YOU a groupie.

You probably have sharebear or Limewire etc so just type in the Artist and you will get a list of their songs. For pendulum try "tarantula". For Arctic Monkeys try "When The Sun Goes Down" or "Fake Tales Of San Fransisco". If you dont have Lime Wire...... DOWN LOAD IT.

No, this is not about the entrepreneur in India who is trying to steal the name of Starbucks for his own chain of coffee shops. This is a serious story! LOL.    Question: How many people out there in blogland swear by their first cup of coffee in the morning? You absolutely cannot live without your first cup of coffee (or cappuccino or espresso or latte or whatever). For me, my caffeine of choice is above.    Researchers at the University of Bristol are reporting that coffee does NOT boost you in the morning. (BBC News) Actually, coffee in the morning helps ease caffeine withdrawl symptoms. Withdrawl? Coffee is a drug? Pshaw!        Professor Peter Rogers, a biological psychologist who led the research, told the BBC: "We do feel a boost from caffeine in the morning, but that's probably due to a reversal of the withdrawal symptoms. That alertness you feel is you getting back to normal, rather than to an above normal level.     First off, a "biological psychologist?" What's up with that? Second, what you feel is "getting back to normal?" What's normal? Call me in denial, but I believe that this study is complete bunk. Caffeine rules! Long live Diet Coke and caffeine. I'm with the pro-coffee activist group on this one.        Zoe Wheeldon, of the British Coffee Association, said the research was interesting. But she added: "There are two sides to the debate and a wealth of scientific evidence suggests that moderate coffee consumption of four to five cups per day is perfectly safe for the general population and does have a beneficial effect on alertness and performance even in regular coffee drinkers."    Yeah! You tell 'em, Zoe. Finally, there are other people out there who see a different use of caffeine - Specifically the combination of Diet Coke, Mentos, and David Letterman. |`|VkdxJmF1aa	well I do not know but my mother drinks a lot of coffee all the day  I think she drinks it just to stay alive . he he|`|6IW1jRUOaa	i love the taste of coffee, however i can still fall asleep or feel tierd no matter how much of it i drink.|`|q1hujlexaa	Yuk coffee has poison in it. it tastes like S !T|`|ADMfnrEXaa	I drink coffee because I like it ...     ... it just happens to help perk me up too!|`|qicRLHMLaa	Usually first thing in the morning only.|`|xExNRCgjaa	For the caffeine, not habit|`|v0mkDjYlaa	just to wake up, not to stay awake  also, I'll get headaches if I stop|`|oGVOOCu6aa	It will help to keep u up because it has caffeine in it.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  |`|ANSRH1BXaa	I drink it to enjoy the flavor.

I usually have one or two more cups later in the day when I start feeling woozy from not sleeping well, but not too late into the evening. So about two to four cups in a day.  When I was working though I drank way more than that.     The coffee you drink as a pick-me-up in the morning could also make you more open to persuasion, researchers say. Evidence from a new study suggests that this happens because caffeine revs up the brain, not because it generally boosts mood.    |`|yfjQAaxdaa	yes i drink it to keep me going throughthe day

He asks her to go out & find him a costume while hes at work. So, the next day before he goes to work he kisses his wife goodbye & reminds her to get him a costume. She happily agrees & says it will be here when he gets home from work. So, later when he gets home he kisses his wife & excitedly asks, "did u get me a costume"? She says yes its in the bedroom & go try it on. So, he does but he comes out as superman & says, "I cant go as superman! I'm a black man! Superman was white, I need u 2 go back & get me something else". So, the next morning he kisses his wife goodbye & reminds her that he needs a costume & the party is only a couple days away. She happily agrees & again tells him it will be there when he gets home. So, he gets home & asks bout his costume. She tells him its in the bedroom & to try it on. So, he goes & tries it on but he comes out & says, "woman! I am a BLACK MAN, I can't go as the jolly GREEN giant! Take this back & get me something else & u better get it right"! So, the next morning he does'nt kiss his wife goodbye & all he says is," u better get me a costume"! So, he gets home & demands for his costume. She tells him its in the bedroom. He goes in the bedroom & finds a 2x4 & comes out & asks, what am I suppose 2 do wit this"?!

2LpWgU20aa	she probably just has a fast metabolism, eats healthy food but doesnt go over board and eats very little junk food. thats what i do to look like that and its not unhealthy, (you need to because the camera makes u look ten pounds larger.) im guessing she weighs about 100 pounds.|`|ox4MdqcVaa	She could have a high metabolism, like me. I can eat all I want and not worry about excercise and stay thin.|`|zvPDTVkxaa	Maybe she is just naturally thin|`|9F8V6Bwtaa	I don't think she hit puberty yet because she has 0 curves.  |`|un1vO4sSaa	it would be crap to be that thin lol but she probably is one of those kids who has mcdonalds everyday but never adds any weight. a lot of my friends are like that.|`|QQdOpG2xaa	some people just have the thin gene!  i have the thin gene, she has the thin gene,   it's just natural, the best you can do is healthy eating and exercise!|`|MiWKmKgvaa	people metabolism keeps them thin or heavy, if kids are heavy, i would say its mostly because of lack of excercise and/or metabolism|`|6iHSZB6jaa	I think it's genetics. She probably  weighs 102lbs. If you want to stay in shape exercise regularly with variety and eat in moderation. |`|ZldqRGwRaa	Ew she's like disgustingly thin! No offense, but if you want to be thin, DO NOT aim to be that thin, it is unhealthy. It may be, as mentioned by other users, that she is naturally that thin.     If you want to trim and tone your body, then limit greasy and fried foods. Aim for lean meat that has been grilled. Try to eat lots of raw vegetables and fruits, or drink a V8 or V8 Fusion, as these have half a serving of veggies and fruits in each bottle. Having a "mini-meal" or light snack every two to three hours can keep your metabolism working fine and will keep hunger away.     As for exercise, dance around for an hour to your favorite music, maybe even come up with a dance. Go onto Youtube and look up some mini dance choreographs, especially in the -dun dun DUN!- belly dance section, as this can really firm up your stomach. Stretch in the morning before school and an hour before you go to bed. Getting into the habit of stretching will be hard and weird at first, but after about a week, it will become more natural and you'll feel better. You could even stretch when watching TV! You could also lift weights or take a vigorous power walk for 30 minutes. Go ahead and explore different parts of your neighborhood during your walk and enjoy what you see.    Anyways, I think the girl in that pic probably weighs 85-95 pounds. She's too thin for her age, which I think is close to both of ours. If you have curves, be proud of them. If you've got a little fat here and there, fine. Guys don't like twigs and bony girls. If you've got a little fat here and there on you, it will get toned into muscles and womanly curves. We were not meant to be skeletons, all skin and bone!    You probably look just fine. And if your a teen, which I'm assuming you are, then it's normal to have some weight on you. I take walks and martial arts and dance at home, I have a 29 inch waist, and yet I weigh 143 pounds! It does not matter about copying someone else. Just appreciate yourself and find out what your body can do through dance and stretching.|`|6whrhoGhaa	Hi! I am, like, as skinny as her. Yeah, they probably have her on some kinda diet, but it could be high metabolism... It's kind of a mixed blessing... you get called toothpick all the time... it's no fun, seriously. You don't want to be as skinny as her.|`|WM9yPVDcaa	She's way too thin and hasn't hit puberty yet.

This guy always said waffle and I wanted to be funny like him so I called him Waffleman. Waffleman is diverse, none really has it and its a cool super hero name. I've been making Waffleman stuff for years.    Couple of months ago I was reborn into a better guy. I the called my self 2.O for the advanced experience.

If i chose the small fish in the big pound then there is a chance of getting eaten by the bigger fish. At least i would have a lot of space to hid and to live and other smaller things to eat.   so i guess i would choose the small fish in a big pound
3bMu2YI1aa	Dia de Muertos, es una celebracion unica de Mexico, me encanta el aroma de pan de muerto y chocolate, el de los dulces tipicos y tambien el olor a flor de cempasuchitl, y ver adornos de papel picado y calavras en las calles y comercios. Tambien las fiestas patrias, incluso nuestra forma de celebrar la Navidad es diferente a la de otros lugares.

Pero aca donde vivo (Villa de lvarez, Colima) tenemos una tradicin muy bonita desde hace muchos a?os. Cada febrero celebramos las fiestas charro-taurinas, mismas que consisten en jaripeos, bailes, cabalgatas, recibimientos y dems. Lo interesante de todo es que, los festejos se llevan a cabo en una plaza costruida nicamente con tablas, petates y sogas, ni un solo clavo es utilizado en su construccin.     Eso hace a la plaza nica e irrepetible. Jams se construir de cemento, simplemente porque es parte de una promesa que se hizo al santo patrono del municipio (San Felipe de Jess), se construye la plaza de toros con esos materiales a cambio de que no haya temblores fuertes, puesto que vivimos en zona ssmica. Esta tradicin continuar y la verdad es que son festejos muy bonitos.

Tengo muchos a?os aqu en Mxico y es hermosa la forma de venerar a los Fieles Difuntos, es UNICA !!!!|`|2wDJmluOaa	el dia de la independencia y el dia de muertos, existen motivos de celebracion similares en otros paises pero la forma en que se celebra es muy distinta, x ejemplo en el caso de la independencia "recrear" el grito, ver las calles llenas de banderas, matracas, silbatos, sombreros, etc. etc. etc. es algo unico  en el caso del dia de muertos, en nuestro pas lo que se celebra es la muerte en s y se recuerda a todos aquellos que ya fallecieron, pero se les recuerda con una fiesta no con tristeza, el ver las calaveras de dulce, las calacas de papel, los manteles de papel picado y las ofrendas tambien es algo unico, asi que disfrutemos las celebraciones en nuestro pas!!!|`|NDzirLLeaa	Definitivamente da de muertos, pero no la fiesta que se hace ultimamente en las ciudades en la q a los ni?os los disfrasan y todo eso, sino la tradicional, la que pones tu ofrenda, recuerdas a tus seres queridos, compartes con ellos tu comida sientes que ellos no te han abandonado, que te quieren y vienen a visitarte, es la celebridad que ms me gusta de todas las que c hacen n Mxico, definitivamente la mejor, y los dulces, las calaveritas d azcar, de chocolate, de amaranto, de gomita, hacer las famosas calaveritas que era todo un quebradero de cabeza en la escuela cuando t pedan que hicieras una sobre algn compa?ero o tu maestro, eso si q era el da de muertos, los concursos de ofrendas q afortunadamente siguen vigentes, las catrinas, todo lo de da de muertos me encanta, los olores a incienso, la flor de zempazuchil, las fotos de tus familiares fallecidos, las calaveritas con sus nombres, o s es en la escuela o el trabajo con l nombre de todos, bueno me gustara q no c perdiera la verdadera esencia de la celebracin, ahora que ya c acerca, q si entran costumbres extranjeras q entren pero q no c pierdan las nuestras...|`|gyCDQuINaa	En tepoztlan, hacen la subida del tepozteco, no se si conozcas tepoztlan?  Mira en tepoztlan el pueblo esta en las faldas de un cerro y en la punta del cerro una piramide, cuando es el dia del tepozteco, una persona caracteriza al rey tepozteco y en la noche iluminan todo el camino hasta la piramide con velas, y la persona esta sube danzando con ropas prehispanicas, es toda una tradicion mexicana donde no influye ningun otro pais!!!  Ya q en dia de muertos, estamos mas infleuciados por los estados unidos y ya hasta hacemos halloween en vez fistes de dia de muertos o no??|`|Nvfu9eXxaa	Uno de mis deseos es encontrarme en Mxico durante la celebracin del da de muertos, algo tan particular que se me hace muy interesante, igualmente las posadas y la celebracin de la independencia, creo que para eso necesitar ms del tiempo previsto, tal vez mi amor por tu pas haga que no regrese al mo y me quede a vivir all, si me lo permiten claro est.    Saludos, L@r@.|`|97c3446cca2d2f83108483d4fea11533aa	El dia de Muertos es tradicin mexicana 100%, el dia del taco ya sabes que los mexicanos nos pintamos solos para celebrar todo.

Sin lugar a dudas optimista, pero una optimista realista ehh!!!. Keo jiss jiss!!!|`|wKVCZ4T4aa	Pues soy optimista realista.   Ver una realidad, que no es tan buena, no es ser pesimista sino realista y eso ayuda a afrontar el problema de forma positiva.   Negar un problema pretendiendo ocultarlo en un falso optimismo es no poder o no querer afrontarlo, lo que no ayuda a solucionarlo.    Besos!  |`|i8SNuIm9aa	Principalmente soy optimista, aunque en segn que casos soy pesimista.|`|9B8jRkK2aa	Como buena gminis que soy, tengo de los dos, es decir segn con que pie me levanto, hoy me pillas con el dia pesimista y malo, en fin aqu son las 21.12 ya queda menos para que se acabe este da de mierd4|`|FtenQvo6aa	optimista|`|7bByDWc1aa	optimista|`|8kdhcjOCaa	Por naturaleza soy optimista y luchadora aunque tambin tengo mis dias malos.Aun asi, en seguida se me pasa porque s que hay peores situaciones que la mia y porque tengo la suerte de tener una familia estupenda y el amor de un hombre generoso y maravilloso.

AA10916001	Getting technical, there are more votes CAST for American Idol....but in a presidential election you only get one vote...on AI people can vote as many times as they want.|`|G9soyq4vaa	american idol definitely!!!  because anyone can vote. not just people over 18. :D|`|LPXa75t3aa	I would hope for the Presidential Election!!!! If Not that thats really sad...|`|0609426fda08946a612ca70eb8ea7eeaaa	I'm sure this year the Presidential election will be getting more people voting then the last elections. |`|AA11519707	The Presidential Election.  You have to remember that  a lot of those millions of votes that AI gets are multiple repeats (100+ text messages, etc).    Even with that the Presidential election still gets more overall votes than a finale of American Idol (although this was pretty much the premise for American Dreams I think...it starred Mandy Moore).
QDnZiDuhaa	Yo no estoy en yahoo por los puntos por que no es nada que te lleve a nngun sitio simplemente entro aqui hago mis preguntas mis dudas me rio un poco con la gente intento ayudar con todo lo que puedo por que a mi me gusta que me auden pero d la sensacion que si no llega a ser por los puntos "algunos" ni te contestarian simplemente pasaran   Nunca he respondido con un no se o algo de eso alomejor una vez y puese : me encantaria ayudarte pero no se como pero estare alerta y buscare mas aver si encuentro algo y ya ......   Pero es que es muy gracioso por que ua vez puse na pregunta y me contesta una tonta...no s no te he ayudado pero tu a mi si gracias por los  puntos jajajaj .............pues no me parecio nada gracioso me dio una rabia como para decirla como dejan entrar a ni?atas como tu en este foro hay gente que se mete con los dema sy que cree conflictos o te hacen de raviar con contestar tonterias y deberian de expulsarles o hacer algo ya que no se merecen estar aqui si es solo para molestar ..............  Pienso lo mismo que tu    Un abrazo tio y te dejo una estrella|`|a70ee50a7f5c6c92e7ba8bdf87332128aa	Todos siempre tenemos la necesidad de aprender cosas nuevas, en mi caso siempre trato de responder coherentemente porque quiza esa pregunta si es importante para quien la realiza. No me importa que sea un completo extra?o, lo que importa es que necesita opiniones y yo quiero colaborar con mi respuesta, obtenga o no los 10 puntos... Saludos.|`|47tG4jZ6aa	hay q ser maduro y saber q los puntos de yahoo no sirven de nada, no t ayudan en tu vida, y no cambian naad de tu vida  es al p2 poner +2  para q kiero mas puntos prefiero responder bn y saber q no estoy al p2 aca en yahoo q puedo serle util a los demas y q cuando yo necesite ayuda aca ma van a ayudar aunq mas de una ves he preguntado y nadie me ha contestado :(      masdos|`|AsLO68lKaa	En realidad responder "Nose" solo por los dos puntos por contestar no esta permitido en las normas de la comunidad, es como "hacer trampa", por eso nadie deberia hacerlo, por otra parte a mi me motiva contestar correctamente el hecho de que si se algo que alguien no sabe por que no compartirlo?....ademas se que si contesto bien o por lo menos trato tambien tendre mi oportunidad de q cuando yo necesite ayuda tmb me puedan ayudar....no tendria sentido sumar puntos y puntos si no me sirve a mi ni tampoco a otros....ese es mi argumento, en el que creo fielmente   =)    Suerte!|`|8490a44169fb3fa65e9ff9fca9179814aa	uhm + 2 puntos    jojojo    en primer lugar que la PREGUNTA valga la pena.. o que yo la crea inteligente ahi si daria mi verdadero punto de vista..    en ese caso me ahorraria la pena en responder cada stupidz  |`|2wDJmluOaa	Bueno, creo que en parte depende de tu estado de nimo al momento de ingresar a YR y obviamente tambin de la pregunta. Creo que todos aquellos que hemos hecho alguna pregunta nos hemos sentido ayudados al recibir respuestas coherentes, con sentido y que se tomaron en serio (sea de la categora que sea) as que sabemos lo til que puede ser este medio.  Personalmente me gusta compartir aquello que conozco o lo que pienso y siento, me alegra el pensar que a alguien le ser til lo que escriba. Es cierto que tal vez nunca conozca a quien he respondido sus preguntas pero eso no debe ser impedimento para comunicarnos y para demostrar un compromiso hacia este foro y las personas que lo forman. Creo que es enriquecedor compartir tus conocimientos y sentimientos y permitirte aprender de los conocimientos y sentimientos de los dems.|`|BnuEkfcZaa	puede ser por muchas razones, no necesariamente una......... pero hay veces que (en lo personal) contestamos por que sabemos mucho del tema y ponemos nuestros conocimientos en prctica; otras personas lo pueden hacer simplemente para desaburrirse........ o para ganar mas puntos y subir de nivel.........etc etc.

E6ZgG3Ppaa	I'm becoming much more true to my thoughts in my actions.. I try to be real with people, although you can't always just go around telling people what  you really think about them.  There is a certain level of tact that is necessary ;)  I think life is a journey in learning how to continue to become more true to yourself (i.e. actions matching up with your beliefs) and I am able to grow because God gives me strength and purpose in change.  Interesting question..|`|NMSZ0oxHaa	95%  i'm true to myself  and thoughts match  my action. |`|uFbc1MYaaa	100% and it gets my *** in trouble all the time|`|CPaJg4ywaa	Yes 100 percent in action and words.|`|AA10776535	99%, theres always room for improvement.|`|5a13e4e71861c341cdcba20cf664598aaa	I'll say about 75% of the time.     I don't think it's a question of being true to yourself. You can't do everything you think about. Like, a lot of people may have violent thoughts and don't act on them, which is a good thing. The most important thing is knowing and understanding the emotions/reasons behind your thoughts.|`|Jo8HXGu1aa	Not me or else i'd be in jail! rudeness from people working in the service industry in this country is in-excusable.You should be so lucky you even have a job! and there are people in this country who eat out of the trash and your bitching and being rude to the customers who are your bread and butter becuase your feet hurt or you have a headache??? take a MIDOL *****!!!|`|QbBOJzqvaa	85%

And most of all, that life makes such turns that you would have NEVER expected...life has slapped me in the face quite often lately! but it's good...it's a learning process.|`|AA11623691	taught me that i can  be lazy. |`|baf4d3d0422cb1ed5c151c99a552abc0aa	I was really sheltered, so last year I was struggling to not get senoritis and my grandpa had passed away, which totally took me off guard by how much it bothered me. It was hard trying to balance my personal, social and academic life all at once. My grades fell for a few weeks and i became a total mess.   Thankfully for my boy friend at the time, he really helped me through it and I got back on track. I was able to graduate with a 3.8 but it was a total shock for me to switch from a school with 400 people to an enormous college with thousands of students. And then my boy friend proposed to me and here I am now in my sophomore year of college.|`|5a13e4e71861c341cdcba20cf664598aaa	Working with the public   My annoying friends  My aunt  My brother... just people  |`|uNTpSfMLaa	that there is a great deal I hav'nt learnt or discovered about myself............  live for others.........  |`|NMSZ0oxHaa	life has taught  me to be happy. i read the book --The secret. it has motivated me to respect  myself. i've  become spiritual. enjoy doing charity  work and help the needy. i'm contented and grateful for what God has given me.|`|CPaJg4ywaa	Things are not as they seem.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...i accomplish more by myself...|`|733da09d0cb9e9d0f08ae79290ca1491aa	that im far too TRusting of people on the net!!!|`|AA11910889	that i really suck at trying to make something of myself|`|AA10297617	i've proven that im really a nice person coz i've gained new wonderful frends...|`|80c09877c2a828f8cb10650acbc45c58aa	i've learned i've made mistakes and i'm very hard on myself.  at the same time, though, i'm realizing my strengths as well.|`|AA11224455	I hate Florida|`|J62anGqkaa	A lot...I discovered that I have matured more and I have to be more careful in making any decisions or being friends with anyone.|`|AA11909387	that it was them-not me  money can not buy you happiness  if you think positive you get positive results|`|XOEXJDlIaa	that masturbating in public is apparntly indecent....at least according to the public!!!|`|0f8bd4e08850758ee01070ef4a169aa3aa	i've become much more patient
HHuS48u5aa	I got diagnosed with cancer at age 50..last year..  Got treated...and got FIRED...on May 17 2008.    After cancer...small things are not as important...other people's problems I see differently...if they are controllable..well..... then they are not problems but opportunities..    For me I feel bad I have not done more with my life..since then..to enjoy it.  I feel guilty if I don't get in the poll each day.    I'm thinking it was good...to get cancer...so I could retire and enjoy life and see it differently.    Oh yeah..one detail...the same day I got fired was the day they told me my cancer was gone..so I could NOT have cared less. i SMILED, SHOOK THEIR HANDS AND TOLD THEM IT HAD BEEN A PLEASURE. I WAS A CLASS ACT.    ..and retired...well...except for collecting unemployment.    I decided not to fight the firing...I researched and asked for a nice settlement on my own...ha ha ha. and did just fine.  YES, I AM AN EXPERT.    I was well before my cancer..  in fact I never had a sick day in my entire career.  SO I JUST NEVER EXPECTED IT..    Cancer changes everything. Or anytime you are faced with death.    I uh sort of did something wrong to get fired...I got mad because people were being UNECESSARILY rude to me...and whipped off an email asking to be removed from a fundraiser.     Now my motto is --never regret something that made you smile.    I know my resignation hit it's mark, and it cost me a couple hundred thousand dollars...but I still laugh, and I am still smiling.    AND STILL SAYING MY CREED...   Never regret something that made you smile.    One day. I was sitting at McDonald's  kind of feeling blue/tearful ..and someone out of the blue came over to me and read a poem he made up. It made my day. I HAVE CHANGED.     I try to notice beauty more..and have fun.     I am also addicted to YA...H E L P.|`|u1Kpm7Uaaa	Well, I totally worship Charles Manson now...he is so cool and his music is soooooo good.|`|bCJ6u9Ofaa	death death death, its a *****|`|fMUUXMPNaa	yes ... several event and ppl changed my life fairly recently ...|`|7RzGrKaDaa	Yes...

SLMD50eOaa	kendra..|`|3G3ncBQGaa	My favorite would have to be Kendra, because she' s so funny! But Bridget is really sweet and I like her too. Im not too fond of Holly, but she does seem really sincere and i think she really does love Hef, not just his money.|`|47e7f174343942df4985e92180812d30aa	Bridget.... shes got a better attitude than those other two... Kendra is so dumb and seems like she dont really care for Hef... Holly is a  greedy and just wants his money.. i cant stand her.. and shes so jealous of Barbie Benton (his old gf)... too bad .. Barbie and Hef are still good friends..|`|cn91FeWcaa	Holly is stuck up...bridget is greedy and fat....and kendra (although she is a dumb blonde) is funny and not just after hef's money|`|LAhGRwU9aa	holly she does love him . |`|AA11519707	Bridget.  She's the only one who seems like any fun.  How can you not love a girl who was a finalist on The Search for the Next Elvira and had an Murder Mystery dinner at the Playboy Mansion for her birthday party?    Kendra might be cool to go to a sportsbar with, but she's dumber than a box of rocks (with all due respect to the box of rocks).    Holly just seems boring to me.|`|vem8yyyJaa	Kendra. she is the Most out going person.|`|HLU3LH9zaa	Bridget
FJN8CSXYaa	Hector. I felt more for him than Achilles. He knew he would lose, but fought anyway out of honour. Whereas Achilles fought him to avenge his cousin, even though Hector hadn't meant to kill him.    Great movie. And Eric Bana was hot in that role!! Brad Pitt just looked greasy.|`|9a8f50f9186c4d595388d16738d8d724aa	Achilles...Who wouldn't like to watch a movie with Brad Pitt lookin all good in his skirt? I know I don't have a problem with it!!|`|EfAV3x9Yaa	Hector - He's more of a hero than Achilles.  Achilles is self centered, egotistical and a showboat.  Hector is fighting for something. His brother (who is also a self centered twat), his family and his people.  |`|554d1fcb4f3a54716981c206e2520860aa	I liked Achilles more than Hector.  There is just a deeper back story towards Achilles.  Achilles is kind of represents how society can be today.  The only reason why he fights, is for the greater glory of himself, and it ends up being his down fall.
VaKhLMqxaa	You just need to strengthen your voice.  Try holding the notes longer,  and take deeper breaths.  Your voice sounds shaky.  Squeeze your butt muscles if you have to,  but HOLD THOSE NOTES!  lol  Trust me, it will sound alot better. :)      And, maybe a different song?  good luck with your singing. :)|`|X9egmV9daa	You should take singing lessons because (no offence) that wasn't very good I felt like I was listening to an old man with a blocked nose (sorry) you could try singing lessons and stuff like that, maybe youtube voice training videos or something???|`|H9JE3B3paa	Take some singing lessons. That will totally help. |`|9NM343mLaa	Well, that was interesting. but you can really improve your voice by totally getting a singing lesson. or if you dont want a music teacher, set your own goal everyday just play a song and practice the notes and pitches. if you do that you should make another video and look at your first one and see how much you improved. hope this helps =]|`|aBYuqJjZaa	You have the potential to sing well if put more effort on it.   Of course you must firstly believe in yourself you can make it. Why not, you send your potfolio & recording experience to dream2bcometrue@yahoo.com.sg

EjCaTfq0aa	No the child should decided for themselves like my parents did with me.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No. A child can't vote anyway until they turn 18. |`|2PTlXs9zaa	I would think it unethical to teach their children different from what they actually believe. As far as political, it still only stems from what we believe to be right and wrong in running the country, and in some cases the world.|`|9zrNQryYaa	No.|`|108dd144b67a8cb2a13f084607bb9925aa	No, as the child will see the parent as a role model and assume their opinions or beliefs of the politics to be solid without exploring alternatives.  By the time they are old enough to begin to question what they learned, they may well be too endoctrinated to be skeptical.   It's really no difference than religion.  Children are raised to follow their parents religious beliefs, attend services, etc. and by the time they are old enough to make up their own minds about attending services, choosing a religion, or beliefs, their faith is often so firmly established though 18+ years of family religion that they would never even consider exploring alteratives.

Set on these spots, the pins form a .91-m (3-ft) triangle with one pin in the middle and the others surrounding it. Pins are generally made of wood and plastic, and weigh between 1.53 kg and 1.64 kg (3 lb 6 oz and 3 lb 10 oz). Each pin is 38.1 cm (15 in) tall. Pins have a narrow neck that gradually widens to a diameter of 12 cm (4.75 in) at the widest point, called the belly. The pin then tapers to a base 5.7 cm (2.25 in) in diameter. This design causes the pin to fall if tilted 10 degrees.

I think that music will expand more into the Techno side, with allot more over the top fusions of music and more Virtual way of seeing gigs e.g. the gorillaz movment to the more extream.    |`|1hLRES4saa	I think tom morello will become presedent and then make music cool like RATM!!!

"He's" a woman because "he" was born a woman!!!!|`|qP1iHC0Taa	I think that this is the weirdest think I have ever heard.|`|f87d0f66214d02653b0459a3f68f0303aa	I thought it was odd that he was pregnant until I read the article about him in People. I don't have a problem with him I think that it is odd that he was the one to have the baby not his wife.|`|AaF9jy3Jaa	Just looks disturbing!|`|f4fewTfYaa	lol.  i read this too.  honesty, it gives me the creeps.|`|rCR8D00qaa	that is really a true story he was pregnant and a couple months ago gave birth to a little girl. it weird isn't it l think it just not right for that little girl but who am l to judge....|`|hzxplycYaa	That's just REALLY wrong... well, that's just me. It's like shocking to see, because we don't see that. Why would she want to be a man? I feel so blessed being a woman... but then again.... that's just me! |`|jkfXZXBfaa	you know hes still got a vagina but he also has something in the front that looks like a penis.. so he could like do himself..just a thought|`|lJyxBzrqaa	congrats? ? i mean, liek gud for them, but i dunt real care more than any other family havin a baby. i thenk the news stories sensationalized it a lettle, but the family itself jus wanted to gat it out there cause they knew it was gonna be sensationalized so they wanted to be the ones to write their story. plus sure he was born a women, but transsexual people are technically both male and female, their brains are wired to be one gender, an their body is another. so yah he has a female body, but hes a dude.

U3ZBUOWaaa	yep...29th floor for an hour and a half.  mechanical troubles. It just stopped with a jerk and that is that.

I remember on vavation when we first got to our hotel the elevator wouldn't work, but then we realized it was because we had too much weight on it. Although, I still wouldn't use the elevator for the whole week we were there, instead I walked up seven flights of stairs. It was killer, but at least I burned some calories.|`|BDAVymOMaa	yeah i was like 4 and i was on my own and didnt know how to get out my mum had to go and get some security guy to stop all the lifts in the shopping center so he could get me out =] i was scared tho|`|BCCFbPcpaa	never, but my cousin did a few months ago!|`|vhaIqA6Raa	ewwww NO!!!    thats why I almost never take the elevator...    besides I would have to pee..    :)    Now I'm gonna have nightmares...    :(|`|1d35920fc6ea9ad0c8b1685a92aa62a9aa	Yes the electricity  stopped. and  another strong man let me  sit on his shoulders while I took the top of the car off (this is easy it just lays on a frame) then after I climbed up  on top of the car he helped the others up and then I pulled him up.We  pried the door open and climbed on up on the floor above us then  walked down the fire escape.|`|dIUCgMaHaa	yeah when i about 5 and it took me ten years to be able to get back into one im still a bit scared but not like i used to be..and now at my new job we have the worst elevators that jump and sometimes you have to push the door opn lol but i hav no choice so i always make someone come with me lol|`|cdd147902e81bc55214600dbc4c6afbfaa	Na, but I was stuck on a roller coaster once.

fFVAr5Idaa	no one had a gun. what happened to the times when issues were resolved peacefully or by the simple fist?|`|JQ4K1IpSaa	Since I'm never going to give mine up it is only right that the rule that I apply to myself should be applied to others! |`|FHBpJ3qvaa	no one had a gun|`|mggll8dRaa	Definitely, No One....!!|`|8ZUVToXgaa	No one. Crazy things happen in the hands of some crazy people so....|`|3EyK4x2Naa	No One |`|pGf4mIw9aa	I couldn't have a gun because I know that if someone got on my nerves, I would just shoot them and be done with it. Not to kill them but to let them know, hey shutup and stop talking so much. so no I do not believe everyone should have a gun, especially me..lol|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No, because where there are more guns there are more murders and injures. The NRA though is a powerful lobby and opposes gun control as well as the Republicans|`|a6fUSU2Paa	It wouldn't matter if everyone had a gun or nobody had a gun.  People will still be out killing people.    So I would have to say it'd be best if everyone had a gun.  At least when the crazy people with guns start attacking everyone, the sane people with guns can defend themselves.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	no one. with them, that would be one suspicious world..|`|Nngdk0izaa	No one has a gun! That way, no one would ever need a gun or no one would ever use a gun. |`|v63fzW0maa	yes, It would folks think twice about pullin a stunt to harm anyone if they thought the victim was able to shoot back|`|CJJTdjw6aa	Guns are OK only for the sane ones.|`|7aisLVeiaa	Everyone. Lots of crazy people out there, you've got to protect yourself. That's why I think carrying a gun is ok.|`|EwTFgnmgaa	Actually stastics show that states where citizens have greater acess to firearms have much lower crime rates. States and countries with greater restrictions have more crime.|`|00B394HBaa	Can't work with only those 2 choices...  Some have a gun, but only the ones who respect guns, know how to use them, and under what circumstances to use them...and have one damn BIG level head for decision making!|`|AA12106954	Dang, chick mullet.  |`|9lyWMSHDaa	Thats a great question! I would say everyone. But they all must have those huge 50 caliber Desert Eagle guns. Because it would be funny to see tiny little Asian chicks holding huge as$ guns, and tipping over if they try to shoot one.|`|b37f2b23a440d20ba2b99b465d00d138aa	If we had no guns at all they would use knives from the kitchen|`|I3VfRjYLaa	No guns works well enough here in Australia. You can't remove all guns rom criminals, but it definitely makes it more difficult to get shot while going to school or teh supermarket or just walking around the street.|`|8AYVU9Fcaa	well neither... i wouldnt want for criminals to have guns so if u gave them to everyone they would. and if you took them from everyone the bad guys would still have them. its a huge problem. |`|pxTvnAtJaa	I would rather bullets cost $3000. There would be no more drive by's and people would always think twice before shooting.|`|VZudmlOoaa	no one....obviously!|`|e0nMD08Taa	NO ONE!  less teen crimes,   also no knifes apart from in the kitchen :)|`|AA12342591	Everyone had a gun.|`|iFYIqk0aaa	no one had a gun|`|AA12004569	I'd rather neither. I think the right to own a gun must be earned. I agree with having them in order to protect ourselves and our families, but we should not be able to get one without a thorough background check and a complete course in gun safety. Think of it this way:    If guns were outlawed so no one could have them, then the honest people would not have them and the criminals still would. Hello, they are criminals! They don't care if they are breaking the law or not, so taking away guns from everyone will merely take away peoples' ability to defend themselves against criminals, who are going to have guns whether or not they are allowed. Also, no government in incorruptible. Our government here in America is behaving so far, but what's going to stop them from misbehaving if we had no means to form a militia and no weapons to fight back with? |`|rbqvDZyxaa	no one had a gun |`|rMmVuHEhaa	I rather no one has a gun except me// :P|`|JiWQlMlmaa	Geez you do have a chick mullet.    I had one of those once when my friends chopped off the side of my hair.    Anywho, nobody should have a gun. Guns are easy, true talent takes hands. |`|Dxvd1ABiaa	If everyone had a gun, and everyone knew that everyone else had a gun, then they would be less likely to mess with others. A gun is a form of protection, and criminals can hurt you with or without a gun.|`|SzDlCwfTaa	If we had no guns then everyone would be packing clubs or slingshots or something else.  Guns are easy for the criminals to get so we're in a vicious circle.  The average citizen doesn't need them except maybe for hunting.  The police and the military need them to protect themselves and us.  We will never see an end to guns.  Of any type.  I have out weighed the alternatives and we're stuck with them.|`|OJdkqhd4aa	i hate guns so nooo oneee!|`|Ru4E4ksYaa	everyone have a gun is better. unless its everyone in the entire world. then no one having guns would be better. but people would just kill eachother with something besides a gun so it would defeat the purpose.|`|n1Z8SmAHaa	Every one had a gun, because then no one would dare to rob when people were around.|`|MUkC93kUaa	Everyone.          If no one had a gun, it would not stop them from harming others.  They would find a way.    Therefore, the situation becomes:    "Would you rather everyone had a gun and could defend themselves, or no one had a gun and people would still be harmed but have less viable options for defense?"    When someone is running at you with a knife, it's far easier to shoot them than to find your own knife to defend yourself.  Guns are more quick, and better equipped for defense, whereas murder can be committed with anything.  Yes, I realize this is a bit blunt, but it's simply the truth.
00B394HBaa	As a matter of fact, I don't.  I'm a people watcher, their faces, eyes, way they move...lots of underlying deviousness and shady things going on outside this house.

MUkC93kUaa	Say two people are standing before you.  One has just donated ten dollars.  The other donated one hundred.    Logically, you would think that the person who donated more is the more generous one.    However, presume the person who gave ten dollars started with ten dollars, and gave it all to the charity.  The person that gave a hundred had a million dollars.      Now what?    It simply depends on how you look at it, and the particular situation.|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	whether a person is generous does not depend on the factor whether he is poor or rich. but naturally the rich have opportunities to be generous. for example, the rich can liberally pay wages to his domestic helps, give alms to beggars, donations to charitable institutes, because they have enormous resources at their disposal but in case of middle class people, as they are cursed with empty hands, they could not do so like the rich. one should strive hard for creation of a society in which people should not look for charities and generous activities of the super rich.another thing is the super rich may do all those generous activities to get tax benefits or as an act of atonement for their sins committed in earning enormous wealth by illegal and immoral ways.|`|ht07LcFnaa	I think that the super rich, having little to no experience of want or even need, do not understand such things.  Like Buddha, whose royal parents kept him sheltered from suffering, the super rich think everyone has it easy, and only do without as a result of laziness.  Of course, Buddha rebelled and learned the truth of human suffering, thereby overcoming his "super rich" mindset.  If you have done without, generally, you have more empathy for those you see suffering and are thus more generous!  You are a great questioner April!|`|mggll8dRaa	Poorer People are more generous; they will share much more often...!!    In Value, The Rich Contributor can help more People...!!|`|OKClYfDQaa	The super rich has more potential to be more generous; but it all depends upon how one handles riches. The ordinary people have their own way of being more generous: It is according to the value of what is given as it relates to their willingness and ability to give.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Ordinary people...the rich are usually tight with their money unless they need a tax right-off.|`|3YopxVqFaa	Ordinary people. They have less to give but they are usually the ones who are willing to help others less fortunate than themselves.  I'm not saying the rich aren't generous, but if charitable donations are tax deductible, are they looking out for their fellow man or their wallet.|`|00B394HBaa	Everybody else is richer than me, yet I will give food to the poor, clothes, furniture, kitchen ware, etc.  And the people in mansions? They do donate to hospitals, churches, etc.  But the poor have to go through lengthy processes to get this help.

I got three of the same things... that i already owned!! So i thought it was okay. Better than returning everything for money. THATS *****'y    ;D|`|MUkC93kUaa	Well, to begin, one must consider that there are situations when it's appropriate.      For instance, if you were given a special necklace by your mother, and chose to pass it on to your daughter, it's not a "bad" thing by any means.  Or, if you receive a gift that you know someone else will appreciate more.  One year, I received a perfect pair of shoes -- but alas, they were too small.  They could collect dust for a while until I gave them to charity, or they could go to another family member, who happened to wear that size and like the shoes.          However, it's not as respectable to give an average item to someone if it was given to you in the first place.  As a general rule of thumb, I'd say if you're giving a gift because someone could use it better or it means something special to give it to them, it's okay.  But in other situations, it should be avoided unless you don't have any other options.  |`|JHqFSmFyaa	no but i have been regifted... by my parents... and they were my presents from the year before... haha my dad just wrapped everything in the attic when i was like 8 and there were some like barbies up there from the year before... i thought santa was real i was distraught . haha so no i wouldnt!|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	we Indian  usually do it. it is Indian tradition to give gifts for every function like birth day, naming ceremony, on the eve of marriages of friends and relatives, on the birth day of our bosses, friends, relatives, fare wale gifts and there are millions of occasions  on which we have to give gifts. normally even a rich person can not buy gifts for all those occasions. that is the reason we re gift the gifts. some times it happens that we give the same gifts to those people, who had given them to us.|`|c921a351c155105d6de120b602d122bcaa	Yes, I do and I'm cautious about it because I don't want to hurt anybody.    I recently learned that when we did Secret Sisters in our women's fellowship at church 2 women had each other's names.  One woman gave her secret sister a gift and then later got the same thing from her secret sister.|`|En1bN4Zxaa	Yes-I do.|`|7vRYqtcZaa	No...and i think the term re-gift is self explanitory|`|mggll8dRaa	As a General Rule, No....!!|`|de7bf90bb2066bf0f7dc80a921ffc779aa	Yes, but only if I thought the other person would like the gift,|`|qTHkBmH6aa	my grandma does that to me..saldy|`|a745322b92770fa14e810733a8030534aa	I have never done that.|`|aeODdMATaa	yes, if I don't like it, I would give it to someone who would.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, if I didn't have use for that  present and knew somebody else would like it. I don't feel comfortable with this concept however, because it's loke betraying the person who gave you that gift. So I would think long and hard before re gifting something.|`|lXXuF0T4aa	I regift if i already have it|`|0gpRFkN9aa	no im not THAT cheap! lol|`|681671b8db63cde85f65759dcf0f542caa	yes, I do it with *bad* cologne every year.|`|5cLZlX30aa	One year as a joke we took a bunch of things from my grandma's house (like little statues and stuff she had around the house) in like july and then we gave them to her as gifts.  She was really excited about them and didn't remember that they were hers until we told her!  She's so funny.  Don't worry, we got her real presents.  That was just a joke.  We always play pranks on her. |`|P7L4Vd3Paa	Yes, only if it's in the original, unopened package.  Also, make sure you're re-gifting it to someone who does not know the person who originally gave it to you.  This way, no one can know that you have re-gifted.
Ubw8hrZfaa	Yes.  Everyone does.  If they say they they don't, they are a liar.  And I have the research to prove it...tucked in a box in my basement with all my other college material.    I studied interpersonal communication at Michigan State.  This is ALWAYS the first thing you do when you meet someone.  You size them up based on appearance, and the first thing they say to you, and then seek similarities with yourself.|`|AA10611144	not usually but sometimes|`|fFVAr5Idaa	No, not after my conversion to Islam. I am Puerto Rican (Spanish American, for those who don't know)    Often individual's may assume I'm Arab. I've had maybe 5 occasions where someone spoke to me in funny broken English assuming I may not know English.    I've also had numerous occasions of Spanish speaking individuals who said ill of me, or Muslims in general, and I usually take the opportunity to teach them a valuable lesson "Of not judging a book by it's cover" so to speak, etc.|`|QkpNt5mvaa	Never.    I even don't believe in first impressions, I always give them time as human being is too complex to be judged by first impressions, or by the looks!|`|pfVVSIihaa	I was about to say "Not at all" when I realized that this is not true.    I instantly distrust those in expensive suits, designer gowns and furs.    Very few people earn the money for those things by being honest and ethical!!  LMFAO!!|`|OKClYfDQaa	Yes.

What if clients assumed everyone back at the office sat around eating soup at their desk?  Oppps... we do!|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	How they sincerely interact.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Clothing is a valuable clue about a person's class, conservatism vs. liberalism, eccentricity vs. conformity, and even to sanity. Acutely ill shizophrenics really stand out: these poor people are so distracted by all the voices inside their heads or their obsessional thoughts that they are almost removed from their bodies. If you see a person dressed in rags and wearing a warm winter coat on a hot day in July, this is a very good indication that the person before you is a schizophrenic.  But it is only a clue, and does not infulence my opinion. I hate no classes of people (except for Repukes {Republicans,} but that's a political party, and I can't tell who they are by looking at them). As for looks, body language is a real clue here. A person who has a continuouly hostile stare very probably is hostile. Best to avoid him/her.  In order to have an opinion I have to have an interaction with someone.|`|WzPgCLLAaa	No, I would never do that.

I read that use of special characters like percent sign or pound sign could cause it, so I removed those. (My answer had math in it, so it was easy to have these in it.) That didn't work.   I think that having my answer too long made the  system do this.  But even when I shorten my answer, the system would be hung.  Other things would make it hang also.  Then I tried this:  I saved my answer to a Word file so that I could come back and get it. Then I did the following, and it either worked, or the coffee break "just happened" to end right at that moment:  1) I logged out.  2) I deleted all cookies and temporary files.  3) I logged back in.  Added note:  I think just logging out and back in sometimes works.  How much you have to do depends on how confused the system is.  At least, that seems to be what is happening.  Be sure to copy/paste your answer to Word or something before you log out.  That way you can copy/paste it back in when you get the system working.    One  thing that I have decided is that when it says it is taking a breather, that is just the system's excuse for being confused at the moment.  So don't believe it.  You can make it come back from its "coffee break."  |`|9yxd3Juraa	probably checking the violations. funny how you should mention that I just got one right now!|`|mkpKfpGQaa	they're havin a quickie|`|bb839ebdea71450469bb1e0494ed8da2aa	Picking their @ss probably...|`|zTPQu2yKaa	They go out for a smoke.

A murderer was coming towards the city, 3 girls each jumped in their own sac as he rang their doorbell (clearly, i shortened that!)   A redhead, Brunette, & a blonde. all jumped into their individual sacks to hide.  A murderer came across the first sack and pocked it with the stick. The redhead was inside. "Meow" she said.  "Oh, thats just some cats" the murderer said to himself.  He then came across the 2nd sac, the brunettes.  "Woof" she said when he poked it.  "Oh, thats just a dog."  Then, he came across the blonde's sack.  When he poked it, she said...    "Potato."      hehehe.  |`|hG3luCBpaa	That was funny, I really liked it!|`|Psamf8Dtaa	that made me lol|`|hSI9vaTJaa	not funny. =I|`|AA11226501	lol|`|PCsRznGKaa	haha, it was okay.|`|7jObyt5xaa	LOL :)|`|EkX1osKYaa	haha    lol|`|5adXXQo1aa	Lol, IMO, blond jokes are always fun(ny).

sVBFN6K1aa	Don't change it. It was the examiners fault, not yours! That's how I look at it! Don't worry, it will hardly affect you, you could just say that you didn't notice the mistake!    Good luck! xxx|`|AA11602135	If your teacher read the answer and thought it was acceptable and marked it correct then don't worry about it maybe some aspect was correct enough to give you credit.. It isn't as if you cheated on the test. It is good that you looked up the right answer and now know what it is...the whole point of being tested is to see what you know. If you didn't know the answer prior to the test well you certaintly do now. You have learned something, and know the answer. I say even though it is an honest thing to do it isn't as if you don't know the answer now and if anything you probably will never forget either. Ask your mom or dad and see what they thing you should do. I say...let it stand. learning isn't always about a grade.|`|YL2tAZ4Faa	My instructor wouldn't change it. Tell them to clear your conscious.|`|iON9OINvaa	Tell them, so will appreciate your honesty and probably leave it at 100%.  And that way you still keep your grade and don't feel guilty.|`|bwazmW0Uaa	You are an amazing 13 year old boy..Most of your answers are better than some of my older ones  keep up the good work..sorry i did not answer this one i just wanted to let you know!!!|`|nlSUGP9haa	╔╗╔═╦╗ <br>  ║╚╣║║╚╗ <br>  ╚═╩═╩═╝

wqn4FwGWaa	there is always the possibility, but security has improved dramatically since then. I don't know were i heard this but apparently the security for obama is the biggest ever of its kind for a single person.|`|JaGbP9m1aa	Yeah but you know what? The whole situation is out of our reach. There's no good worrying about it, what can we do? Nothing.    Let's just hope it doesn't happen, and that he does a good job as President :)    Also, he has great security and protection. Did you see the 3 inch thick bullet proof glass he did his speech through!?!|`|XS0ltAYaaa	Who really did shoot JFK though ?   I think it was not Lee Harvey Oswald, he was just the scape goat, he was bumped off before he could get a fair trial, that's suspicious in it's self.   Obama needs to worry about those assigned to protect him, before Joe public.|`|jz68Nueiaa	Yes, there are so many racist morons out there. All it takes is one of them to be successful. |`|bwazmW0Uaa	That thought i am sure crosses Obamas mind every day also when he is out in public..We hope for the best and hope he is not assasinated.|`|ygt6ytRvaa	Well I'm a bit concerned, but the truth is there's always people plotting to assassinate the president. Obama is particularly high profile, being the first African-American to be elected into office, but that's what the Secret Service is for. I'm sure they're taking the extra risk into consideration, besides they're used to dealing with groups far richer and more organized then Neo-Nazis, they take a lot of pride in what they do, I'm sure they'd feel ashamed if they allowed some skin head teens, to kill the president. We're talking about people who would willing take a bullet for the President! I trust the Secret Service will do their best to keep him safe.     Still there is a lot of covert racism in this country and there's is always the possibility, that someone on the inside might want to see him dead, but hey it's a risk Obama was willing to take as soon as he aspired to be Predsident, someone has to be the first. |`|YplGKkZXaa	I always fear that. I myself was a McCain supporter and I would never have feelings like that to Obama, he is a very good man and is oing to be a great president and the people that say those things are ignorant and throwing a tantrum because their part didn't win. Like I said I wanted McCain to win, but I'm over it and ready to see this country progress in PRESIDENT Obama's hands.|`|owYyT0AUaa	Definatly.  It also scares me that there is such ignorance in the world and it scares me to think what it'd do to race relations in America if it did happen. |`|dwkpyh7Qaa	I'm not scared... It's only ignorance that breeds ignorance. This whole thing was just a propaganda stunt by some backwards person who was scared that government might actually change. As for Obama becoming a martyr, I don't agree with that at all. He IS a black man but he does not represnt all BLACK people.He is doing things because they need to be done. There are going to be some black people who see this as "their 40 acres and a mule", but this is not the case.  All the other white presidents did not represent soley white people but the nation as a whole. I myself am a black female and understand that history has been made, not that a black man can become president, but that the nation saw that there was a need for change and banned together to achieve that goal. So as for people saying that he will be assinated, let them try. It seems the fate of all great men that stupidity and cowardice take the form of a*** holes who think they have the right to decide who lives and dies. IF YOU FEEL THAT STRONGLY OPPOSSED TO SOMEONE IN POLITICAL POWER, RUN AGAINST THEM, DON'T GRUMBLE, OR RESORT TO VIOLENCE. |`|LyDd0m7Waa	Yes it's a sad, scary thought..    ?|`|snjdyvlmaa	Hey there,    Yes, I do have a bad feeling but I really do hope that he is well protected.

My favorite characters are Bella AND  Edward( I cant choose just one! :) )       Star for you!!|`|BuJClF3Faa	I have seriously messed up feelings with those books... Katy Perry's song, Hot and Cold comes to mind when I answer questions like these. Sometimes I like them, sometimes I don't. Today, I'm going to go in the middle and say, KIND OF.    Eclipse is by far my favorite. Here's my list:    Eclipse  Twilight  Breaking Dawn and New Moon are tied for last, a VERY VERY VERY dead last, I really hated both of them.    My Favorite character... Um... I like Jacob, Alice, Edward is so-so, I DESPISE Bella, she's the worst protagonist in the history of bad protagonists. I'd have to say either Emmett, Rosalie, Carlisle, Charlie, or Jasper are my very favorites. Esme too, but she's hardly even in the books. :(    Even if today was one of those days that I like the books, I would still say that it's poorly written and that it's WAY overrated.|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Fer sureeee!!! =D Loved em, I don't think I spent more than a few days reading any of the books because they were so good.  I think Breaking Dawn was my fave, or Twilight.     My fave character is Edward. |`|Bt1r42Nnaa	yes|`|qWujgNyOaa	No, I don't. I tried reading Twilight, but it was so boring that I could barely make it through half of the book.|`|VMXOWt9jaa	no i think the books are overrated|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Eclipse is probably my favorite book out of the series.    Favorite character? Edward! Duh!

No I haven't read those books nor do I plan to, OK.|`|nG13Bvc4aa	i luv those books!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... omg virtual high five! lol  ur getting a star =)  yea, i dont know i really liked twilight, sometimes the firsts are just the best, not that the others werent good. which is ur favorite?   i really like alice, shes so friendly and nice! =)  they're definitely girl books though. its just an unsaid rule, lol.|`|GAxhD5yZaa	Yes, I do    My favorite is Twilight since I've only read that one, (I'm reading New Moon at the moment).    Edward    I will star this question.    ~Lost Without Fredrick |`|sCuumWVTaa	Haven't read that too busy with classic American literature like The Crucible.

Their life is made!|`|R3v0EZFcaa	ya i luved them, started them just before the 4th one came out, finished them all within 3 days lol. Host was good too (also by stephanie meyer). i lent them to all my friends, who also luvd em. i almost don't like that they're so popular though, now it's like EVERYONE reads them and they're old news.     Eclipse was my favorite :)|`|YUDwt7SVaa	YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!    Eclipse is my favorite =)  If I rated them it would be  Eclipse   Twilight  Breaking Dawn   New Moon  (I love the end of New Moon though)     Of course Edward and Bella are my favorite characters, but my favorite other characters are Alice, Emmett, and Seth.|`|oCXlzY04aa	I heard they were good books and i am gettign one next week have you ever read the book wake|`|0njU91iPaa	mah fav book is breaking dawn and fav character is renesmee  i finished whole series in less than a week!

LTS3GCpQaa	30 , maybe 35 for the youngest     You don't want someone in their mid 20's no offence to all those people in their 20's but it seems to young to be handed a nuclear arsenal      Oldest -- ?      The mandatory retirement age minus 4 yrs      If you can expect some guy to continue driving a bus or working in an office until he is 65 then it seems reasonable to expect the oldest age allowed in the Presidency should be the same as that      So 65 ( or whatever the retirement age is) minus the 4 yr term - for a total of 61      So if you run at 61 and win your first term - you don't get to try again for a second term ----     We had a bunch of old men sitting in Senate in Canada --- appointed until they died -      Sleeping 90 yr old men and women hard of hearing appointed by the Queen on advice from the PM - sat there going over the bills from 1867 to the late 1980's      Now there is a mandatory age of 75 in the House of Senate (The red chamber) It's change and a slight improvement --      I don't want or advocate for an elected Senate at all - but I think 65 would have been a better age than 75 for a cut off period |`|zT1FHb7iaa	I think youngest shouldn't matter as long as you are a legal adult and have EXPERIENCE. Oldest should be like 55-60|`|ZNPzZEFWaa	17  71|`|72af5eebdf84f4004eac242b1044e2efaa	USA requires candidates to be 35+.     There are no age restrictions since a guy could be 97 and run for President but it's an unwritten rule you have to be 35-70 at the time of your first term. A dude could be crisp and in good health at 97 but people want their Presidents a bit younger than that.

My favorites are Fruit Punch and Cool Blue, but I'll drink different ones, except for grape and orange. Anything orange or grape flavored has always made me sick.

6kUx7fwcaa	It all depends on what kind of problem I have.  I almost always talk to my wife and even if I don't, the people I talk to also know her, so she finds out eventually.  Talking through your problems is not only a way to find solutions that you may not have thought of, it is also a way to make the problem clearer in your mind and possibly lessen to impact it has on you by getting different perspectives.  It has also caused me to stop procrastinating about things.|`|08afM6NEaa	friends..|`|eMYOiim8aa	I try to find a solution if there is one by searching on-line.

DA5ZbYjlaa	Obama ran as the anti-Bush, successfully painted his opponent as Bush the 2nd, and it worked. McCain didn't do a good enough job distancing himself from his predecessor, similar to Al Gore's struggles in 2000 distancing himself from Clinton's scandals.|`|4EkE8eebaa	E. People wanted Bush out and someone else that wasn't going to screw the entire USA in a financial crisis and then leave. They also wanted someone that could actually clean up his mess.|`|SRjRn4ZMaa	i hate to admit it being a republican, but i think it was all of the above. no one in their right mind likes the war, the smear campaigning got old FAST, and palin really wasn't the best choice for vp.|`|uPpWK7JGaa	I pick all of the above, and that Obama knows what the hell he's talking about.     I still respect Sen. McCain. Gov. Palin, not so much.|`|Lcq5s3Wcaa	normo|`|8790e9fc78bbbb4628df687c604fba86aa	A. Although instead of all the reasons you mentioned (although they are good reasons), I think a simple answer would be Bush's stupidity and the internal/external threat that he made people believe in - got them us scared that we would follow everything he wanted us to do - including giving up our basic rights.    E. Long years of fear, economic instability, etc...all leading to a NEED for change!|`|DmAyaqi3aa	uhm all the above....|`|LIv7RKnDaa	All of the above.  I'm Australian and want to say a MASSIVE THANK YOU to all Americans who helped contribute toward this change. It was most definitely needed and I have great faith that Obama will hold true to his promises.    When the country goes to war and the economy fails Obama is the man to fix it! 
6kUx7fwcaa	Unfortunately it does not.  The percentage of votes may have been closer because of this factor.  Maybe it is even a better story that, as a nation, we rose above irrational prejudice to make the best rational decision anyway.|`|4EkE8eebaa	That's what I thought too. I thought Americans were dumb racist people before they voted for Obama. Now I find it sad that they had their first president of another race before us Australians had our first prime minister of another race. Not even an aboriginal!

They were not a band that was innovative or ground breaking in anyway, and I don't mean that in a disrespectful way at all.  Plus you're in order to be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame, you had to have your first album out at least 25 years ago.  They wouldn't even qualify at this point.  It won't happen.  The Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame is really just Jann Wenner from Rolling Stone and his cronies.

Blink 182 was in their day, a revolution of music, in a time when the top albums were commonly held by a group of people who didnt play instruments, Blink came in and said "**** you guys, we'll be the ****" and forever changed the face of punk, before Blink came around punk was well punk, The Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, later The Descendants, NOFX, and thats how Blink started, just listen to Cheshire Cat, had that been all they did then we wouldn't have this question they would barely be known, but they started to do something we had never seen before, thats mix in these pop vocal harmonies that every one had fallen in love with in the late 90s, with their punkier gitar riffs and quick drum beats, inveting their own new style, which had been seldom seen before them-- Pop-Punk, since that time Blink has impacted so many people, influenced so many bands , the list goes on, Four Year Strong, All Time Low, We The Kings. I beleive that Blink will, at least for a while be like a Led Zeppelin, but in a different sense, Zeppelin is still around becaue "they are classic rock" same thing with the beatles and all these other huge classic rock bands, Blink will be around in the lives of teenagers for some time because thy bring a sound that hasnt died, it goes on with all these new bands imitatiing their sound, and that their music is relatable, I get it, other teenagers get it. If I have my way Blink would be in the hall of fame, as i see them as like a Tom Brady of Rock, no one doubts that Tom Brady will be in the hall for football, but the question is how great is he, i mean he isnt from the old days, same thing with Blink, "well they aren't this kind of music" of course not, they ARE Blink, that is its own style. Personally i believe without Blink we would be stuck tody with way more rap and way more Backstreet, but Blink saved us giving a (re)birth to the Alt. Rock Scene.    So to answer your question, Yes, yes I do|`|ZieeKAwIaa	MOST DEFINITELY!!!!|`|sRw9oiQdaa	Not now.

EeH97vIkaa	No i haven't seen that movie
PuSMgyZDaa	buy:    Dumb and Dumber    I think even after multiple viewings, it keeps getting funnier and funnier|`|3mAgM405aa	The German foreign film entitled "The Princess and the Warrior" which was the second directorial film of Tom Tykwer of "Run Lola, Run" fame.  The "Princess and the Warrior" is 5-star rated by over 480 amazon customers and is best described as "Spellbound[ing."  It's a romance in which the heroine wonders what it means to fall in love and how she can overcome someone else's suffering from the loss of his wife.  Even though the spoken film language is German, the English subtitles are very expressive and readable due to the slowness of the language presented.

Lp29F1ZZaa	I'm emo and I would probably laugh. I wouldn't find that offensive, but I think some of my friends might.|`|KpEayiqcaa	if there're emo, then i guess so  but i have a few emo friends and they love shirts like those..lolz|`|VwtMfZMmaa	lol its funny|`|a6UuiDMWaa	It's funny and cute|`|ogUJ6G0Caa	I wore a t-shirt once that read: youre just jealous cause the voices only talk to me. i thought it was soo cute! you wouldnt believe it but my sister in-law took it personal and didnt speak to me for like 2 months! things that make you go hmmmmmm ya think? My point? if a person is offended by something they read off sombodys t-shirt, then you gotta wonder... is the person whos offended all together in the first place? i mean it is a free country right? (well im in the USA) so screw it! is what i say. (although i never did wear that shirt around her again) hmmmmmm|`|cgyTWMw1aa	OMG!! where did you see it?? i soo have to get one !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AdGcqzwXaa	i dont think its offensive...its funny|`|OujY7GcDaa	Get it! who cares if someone doesn't like it! It's not like it's their shirt! If they get offensive then who cares about them and if they don't like it then they shouldn't look! I saw someone with that shirt too and its cute!! get it! who cares about other "emo" people!|`|UPdJF0tyaa	haha.  i dont think they would|`|44fbG4IUaa	i want that shirt! i have so many emo friends and i know someone who has it and wears it around them. get it!|`|AA11753261	haha.. no why would they get offended?       SMILE :)|`|ox4MdqcVaa	I think it's stupid, no offence.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	I'm sure some emo kid would get upset and get their emo friends to cuss you out.

ff2144b1a80426ad4335c3e5633a290caa	I don't think so, if you went way over the top (Like that's all you talked about) then you might seem a little bit selfish, but selfish isn't the same thing as 'self-serving jerk'  You might want to stop talking about 'angel from heaven' though because to others that might sound like you are bragging to much, it does seem to me that you are saying that a lot, but that's just my opinion.   You can always stop being a jerk (if you think you're being one). Ask about how your old buddies life is going, what's happening in their life, be interested in what's going on with them too.   Hope this helps.   Allie|`|H8RpSpuSaa	i don't think..|`|jK8xy3VUaa	That's great for you. But maybe you should ask them about how they are doing. It shows you care. Hope this helps. :) :)|`|PXarLma8aa	some people will be happy for you :)|`|Qu8VVVhbaa	no.  you're just extremly happy for yourself, and there's nothing wrong with that.  good for you :)  and  good lick with your girl :)|`|2193c4e44db8189b4abf5d6676cc8346aa	I wouldn't like you either if you were constantly rubbing your "great" life in my face|`|5FiO6aNCaa	Don't know about you, but I sure as hell am...|`|hv9lGwdlaa	sure    xP|`|i6SpizSFaa	you are a jerk|`|rEELErf5aa	Doesn't sound like it, but we all are sometimes, but self serving? I don't see it... ,jerk is only a matter of opinion... No... and seriously, I think the people who aren't happy you are happy are self serving jerks.    s

6D4a6PoVaa	Gram Parsons ("Return Of The Grievous Angel"), The Byrds ("Mr. Spaceman"), Bright Eyes ("Land Locked Blues"), Neil Young ("The Needle And The Damage Done"), and Cowboy Junkies ("Sweet Jane", a cover of the Velvet Underground song).  Also, Wilco ("Impossible Germany"), and Creedence Clearwater Revival ("Fortunate Son") and Lucinda Williams ("Car Wheels On A Gravel Road").    The people above me either a) never listened to Neil Young and Crazy Horse, or b) just have bad taste in music.|`|MVOeApxSaa	Uhhh    Do you mean like, Bon Jovi?      I'm pretty sure Country Rock isn't a genre.|`|WrLJqP8aaa	AIRBOURNE    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC1viguDc...    check that out , you will love it|`|aufhgg5xaa	I only like The Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd    Take it easy - The Eagles    Free Bird - Lynyrd Skynyrd|`|a5070251bcc17c36a1b36358b5133785aa	I'm not into most of that crossover stuff, but I love some of the country-indie rock genre, especially Neko Case.  Ryan Adams is ok, too, but I think he pales in comparison to Neko.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	I love southern rock like Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Eagles, CCR, that kind of stuff.|`|PiDHN4TOaa	I'm a fan of everything except Rap. Marshall Tucker and Charlie Daniels are my two faves and those two songs are tops of the list along with Fire on the Mountain. It's just a shame the Caldwells didn't live long enough to see their full potential.|`|0CjkEK7Raa	If by "Country Rock" you mean "Southern Rock" my favorite is Lynyrd Skynyrd.|`|Z6Gyw2juaa	Can't You See by The Marshall Tucker Band  Let Me Love You Tonight by Pure Prairie League|`|p20v99N2aa	Kid Rock: All Summer Long.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QhMzG0cz...|`|IKCfT9tnaa	I like all that have been mentioned by friends above me.

Kid Rock's new tune Summertime is a good one ? & Carrie Underwood WOW what a voice lots of good talent in Country these days ? ? ?|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	In the past it was Marshall Tucker and most of their catalog fills the need for me.  Late nineties it was Whiskeytown. Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart and Dancing With The Women At The Bar are just a couple of the songs I like.  Now I listen to Ryan Adams and James McMurtry and Ray Wylie Hubbard.  They are country rock or rock and roll.  I am not big on labels with music.|`|kILkOc6saa	I am.    Favorite artists: Neil young, Buffalo Springfield, The Byrds, The Eagles, The Flying Burrito Brothers.    The people who said it doesn't exist just don't know their genres well.    Douglas, Lynyrd Skynyrd is southern rock, not country rock|`|3yvuMkzTaa	GRAM PARSONS, the father of country rock!!!|`|gDxMoBl9aa	I am    The Jayhawks, Marshall Tucker, Hank Jr, Johnny Cash, & Steve Earle would be My favorites.    Jest a few songs from the genre I like    Blue, Sister Cry, Clouds, Two Angels,  & Sioux City by The Jayhawks    Can't You See, Heard It In A Love Song, Fire On The Mountain, & Long Hard Ride by The Marshall Tucker Band    Women I've Never Had, O.D.'d In Denver, I've Got Rights, & Family Tradition by Hank Williams Jr    Ring Of Fire, Sunday Morning Coming Down, Folsom Prison Blues & The Man Comes Around by Johnny Cash    The Devil's Right Hand, Copperhead Road, Ben McCulloch, & Guitar Town by Steve Earle|`|GwwcqUCoaa	CCR, " Bad Moon Rising".|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Little Big Town as currently my favorite group - her voice is awesome, the band rocks, in my opinion.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NVihnGzP...      Listened to it all.. Bob Seger, John Cougar, Lynard Skynnard, now I listen to Sugar Land, Little Big Town, Gary Allan -|`|c3MFIbeUaa	I believe  the term country rock genre started out in the early sixties and can be seen from early spinoffs from songs like Carl Perkins and the Beatles. It was gaining popularity as folk musicians found a way to incorporate the new electric guitar sound to their songs. Buffalo springfield and Bob Dylan being excellent examples. AS things moved forward there was other slight splits that should how different styles can mean more fans in the culture.   Look at the styles of someone like John Denver and the Eagles and linda Ronstadt.   Much of todays light rock culture is inspired directly from those early bands.   Others went on to be icons of their times and parts of their country. Creedence Clearwater revival and Charlie Daniels, Marshall Tucker, Gram Parsons and the Greatfull Dead.   Country rock has been pretty much eliminated in name only today as most country musicians play that stle and labels have just dropped the rock from the genre.   Kieth Urban, Garth Brooks, Brooks and Dunn are excellent examples of that. Still great music but lacks the stigma of the past of the 60's and 70;s when songs actually had something to say. You mentioned marshall Tucker and you know i am a big fan of them. The Caldwell Brothers influenced many are are directly responsible for getting Old Charlie Daniels the break he needed to get going. As well as others too.   Since you mentioned Marshall Tucker Band for this one Despite losing three of their original founding members.  1.Heard it in a love song  2. Can't you see  3.Fire on the mountain  4.This ol' Cowboy  5. Desert Skies  6. Heard it in a love song  7.Bob away blues  8.I should have never started lovin' you  9.Life in a song  10. Tell it to the devil  11. My Jesus told me so     I could go on but to sum it up. Carolina dreams was their best album.|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Country rock? Is this a joke? Who would combine something as crappy as country with rock?|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Yeah, I'm pretty sure that country rock isn't a genre. There definitely is no rocking going on in country.|`|lILfQh6xaa	i love Cant you see, Cant you see, what that woman lord has been doin to me. Buy me a southbound, all the way to New Orleans. LOL. Jk.

That is a good song tho.|`|bNRUjnGZaa	I love Country Rock and agree with Marshall Tucker but my favorite song by them is "Fire On The Mountain"  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2AJvhrAl...|`|ONWCXzUMaa	The Flying Burrito Brothers  song Hippie Boy  take care  dave|`|9881c718c5d185396cfb435361c21078aa	Wow, this question really stimulated everyone's brain....well, those with a brain.

I season what I cook.|`|f7l9byFGaa	no, I use salt on everything.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	I never add salt when I am cooking - so I am not offended when people add salt themselves.  Personally I have a high salt habit - but my husband uses no salt.|`|wnyuH0aTaa	No, but it'd get salty if they pissed on it.|`|Poht8MR9aa	No not everyone's taste buds are the same.|`|zAPzCIBEaa	most definitely not , I don't like salt so everyone has to salt the food I cook.

Bite me.|`|RN0zRPH4aa	do we have a third option?|`|8jBLAu47aa	Faith Hill is nowhere near as attractive as Angelina.       Maybe that's just me,but Angelina has her beat by a lot.

I think Jessica Beil is pretty hot for a girl and if you trying to go "bad a$$" like everyone thinks Angelina is I would say Michelle Rodriguez from fast and furious, swat, and blue crush. She's tough and she's cute.|`|VDOBhBYhaa	I like both. Neither is better or more sexy than the other. Both are just as great. Those who say one is better than the other are just being judgemental and superficial. Like as if any of you are so great. I guess since they are just celebrities we don't look at normal persons like you and I and have no problem putting them down. |`|Pi31YZ5Qaa	Angelina blow Faith out of the water.

He can kill ANYONE!|`|97M9cvd7aa	In my favorite movie the main guy dies along with millions of other people. So I guess not. It would be cool to have your own background music though.|`|2b2shv6caa	Yes I wish my life was like one of my favorite movies.  My favorite movie I am referring to now is titled, Meet Joe Black.  I would like a life experience similar to the daughter character Claire Forlani played.  To have a father-daughter relationship that is warm, loving and with a deep knowing bond to each other.  The music would be wonderful to accompany my life. |`|mrpDzBL5aa	No. Belive it or not, but there are too many things that could go wrong. Also, I don't think I would fit in very well in Blades Of Glory :)

Most guys fail to realize that girls only want simple things from them. Giving a girl your time, attention and sincere devotion are the best gifts you can give to her.     Treat her birthday as hers and not yours. Try for once to make her feel special, talk about her and not you, do simple things for her. Lift a chair for her, open a door or prepare her a simple meal. Put her as your first priority and put off all your other activities with your buddies.     Most guys I know, use their girlfriend's birthday as an excuse to celebrate with their friends and spend the night drinking or some other activity. The girl ends up feeling as if it's not a special day for her.|`|TB5NAHwSaa	What winnie said remember birthday. |`|Sicr0Mdoaa	a kiss.

OK35ys7Gaa	Esto me recuerda a una pregunta similar que habias echo en el pasado sobre un musico. Y un terrible conductoro perverso morboso.  De doble moral.  Es asi los medios norteamericanos sino hay sangre y escandalo no tienen "rating". Y el publico lo aplaude.   Es una forma de persecucion. Es hasta diria que estan educando a las personas en la discriminacion y en la xenofobia. Son educadores por mas que lo nieguen. Son personajes publicos. Y ense?an a la gente a como se tiene que comportar ante los extrangeros.  Es lamentable que a pesar de todo no haya nadie legalmente hablando que lo raje de su trabajo. O sea que es una gran injusticia.

tc0gU2o0aa	The Yugoslav anthem was written by a Slovak who replaced the Polish melody with the new lyics. The Polish was very nationalistic so anti-USSR but the new lyrics were pro-Slav in general, so it was adopted by the South Slavs (Yugoslavs) after WWII. Then the Yugos broke away from the USSR, but used the anthem to supress religious divisions saying that "we are all brothers because were all Slavs"  Of course not everybody in Yugoslavia was Slavic, there were many Germans in Vojvodina for example who were deported, Hungarians, and Gypsies also, but it turned out to be the religion that was very had to supress.     Actually I was born in Yugoslvia but didnt know this. Once it caused confusion in a boxing match in Poland where the Polish lost to  a Yugoslav but the crowd started cheering anyway at the anthem.|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	I think your hint is incorrect. Or I might be.     Yugoslavia was part of the Soviet Union Eastern Block. Before that it's primary State, Serbia was closely allied with Germany. Poland was as well. I would say that that is the answer to this question. Same allegiances, similar Songs.    MINISTER  S. F. C.

Here's some interesting facts...  lol!    Here are really awsome facts all about CATS!!!!    Cats have 32 muscles in each ear!    Cats always land on their feet.    The high score of a house cat living is 21 YEARS!!!!!    Cats actully DON'T run faster than dogs!    Cats can hear more than dogs.    If cats didn't have scratching posts or trees, they could die of long claws!!!! Very sad    A fox acts like a cat, but it is NOT a cat. It's called Catty Dog!!!    A lion cub can learn to hunt at the age of 6 months!    Some white tigers have NO stripes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Once there was a test between who's smarter a cat or a dog and cats are smarter!    Cats can live without humans existing!!    Dogs cannot eat cats. They chase them FOR EXERSISE!! NOT FOR FOOD!!!    A cat is a hunter, a dog is a scavenger (it eats it's leftovers)!    A lion hunts down a zebra. A hyena comes and eats the leftover meat.    A tiger is the biggest cats ever!!    A wolf is the biggest dog ever, a tiger would win.    A lion roar could be herd 6 miles away!!    A tiger can kill an elephant!    A cat can hear from 10 miles away and a dog can hear from 3 miles away!    |`|TKZ5tcV3aa	It depends what kind of cat.

AA10007207	There is no comparison of a netbook with a Palm device. Palm is better compared to Apple iPhone. Unless you are talking about the Palm Folio which is discontinued - that's an early netbook.    A netbook is a stripped down laptop - weight, size, memory, processor, and keyboard. But a netbook is perfect for surfing, listening to music, taking to school, traveling on business, etc.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	netbook|`|KuPJO5B1aa	yes buy the thing|`|WeNWlYT4aa	Get the palm pre. Netbooks suck|`|4XixPfluaa	I'd probably go with a netbook.  There's a good buying guide that points out the importance of deciding between convenience and performance.  While a palm might be more convenient, you're severly limiting what you can do (surfing, etc.).  I love my HP Mini Netbook.

43OyPhCVaa	listen to my story, my grandparents from my dad side were from the mainland china but they moved to indonesia then they had my dad and my parents have had me and i raised in indonesia. so i am a chinese indonesian.    i think u r cool, u been in argentina and now in new zealand and u r chinese by race. can u speak spanish or portuguese and chinese?    i think u r still argentine, but u r also new zealander, but u r also chinese.    ur life is interesting, girl!|`|Bh3QeLaoaa	your freakin' lucky is what you are.|`|WfwFuQB0aa	you are a new zealander by nationality because of the fact of citizenship and this is what you need to put on all official papers.    your heritage is argentinian of chinese parents but that is different.    it is more important, in my opinion, to be proud of who you are than worrying about if you are an argentinian born chinese girl.|`|KoAPinypaa	By virtue of where you were born, you are a native-born Argentine; although you are of Chinese descent.  Because you are now a citizen of New Zealand, yes, you are now a New Zealander.|`|30bec3177e3b5db11c5b72b82bf84bb5aa	You are a New Zealander by way of Argentina, and with Chinese roots.|`|5a2e3c1b8e15cdfce9f01cfa415d66a3aa	Were your parents Argentine citizens when you were born, or just visiting? You are Argentine in the first place, Chinese in the latter. You are however also a New Zealander, considering you have residency there. Nowt wrong with having more than one nationality - celebrate it rather than getting confused about it.|`|Dy0cyJ71aa	Your both. Your citizenship means you belong to a certain country but that doesn't mean you're still not an Argentine-born Chinese girl. The second was given to you by birth and the first by the state.

mVqvqoz5aa	The only person I know thats still a virgin is my fiances friend. Then again, I'm 25 and most of my friends are around that age and by that age you're usually not a virgin. I was surprised when I found out my fiances friend was a virgin because hes 31 or 32. Hes saving himself for marriage. Now thats a guy with hard core values!|`|rM0ppYQNaa	are you one of those people??    do you want to find out??    I'm home now - "come" over and see if i surprise you|`|fe17567cd409e9ef948b874d8091f511aa	Because sex is everywhere. We're surrounded by it.    By the way, I'm a virgin with no interest in sex. I don't know why people like it. Guess you can call me asexual.|`|25zeMDmqaa	I like it that way.  I'm not going to hang out with a bunch of ho's and hear them talk about their lastest hookup.  Also the guy i'm dating, i prefer it if he is because then i know that he doesn't have anything and if we were to do anything then i wouldn't get anything.  |`|k49jRjUeaa	because thewy think that they should have had sex already unless there really young|`|AA12363288	No one over the age of 18 is a virgin.|`|RLB5ABH3aa	Beucause it's a rare thing over the 20 years old...  And every adult people just think in sex! hahahah!|`|l3b0hjdWaa	because sad to say it's a rare thing these days|`|BZmlBM27aa	because they think everything's about sex  sex is the only word on their minds|`|4EMRg9fAaa	I guess because it's so hard to come by these days..    Literally and figuratively..|`|UIg5MxhJaa	Well I hope they're at an appropriate age.|`|uZdvww5Iaa	I'm 42, I'd be shocked if I was dating a virgin.    I'd turn and run away as fast as I could.|`|uXuPqiptaa	because there are far and few between|`|FU5sZqVVaa	Because everybody expects everybody to be a slut and not be a virgin. Why are you so surprised?

F2ygsPEbaa	Government and Politics, Hot Pink!    You are one of the few posters I have seen in there who doesn't go off on people who might have a view dissimilar to yours.  In most other sections, there is some modicum of healthy respectful debate when differences in opinion arise, but I guess it is just a sign of the times that people seem more passionate and less tolerant of diverging views in the political arena.    I don't like Obama's politics, but I sincerely hope he is successful because the country needs him to be.  But this will require a whole lot of work and a whole lot of sacrifice by EVERYBODY if it will work.    EDIT - Yes, and I would also add that Religion and Spirituality is also pretty volatile and emotional as well.|`|bVbwbqtpaa	Global Warming by far. If you don't fall in line with what they believe(their religion) they get all bent in a hurry-LMFAO!|`|RBQrgByeaa	Marriage and Divorce|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Gosh, I have only been in the R & S section & the politics sections. I have had my share of e-mails from bible quoters & people telling me the history of war. They can't see when they send me these e-mails that they wasted a whole lot of time. I put up my hand & say "talk to the hand" but they can't see that. Maybe my avatar needs to become a hand & say talk to the hand. That would save them from these long converstion e-mails they mistakenly think I am going to read.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	In my opinion, none of the above.    I find the "other - cultures and groups" category to be the most intolerant and uptight. They dont believe in thumbing down, they just report answers that they dont like. Its a joke.|`|AA11696297	prolly a toss up between Politics, and Religion & Spirituality|`|2H2RVmiEaa	Probably Politics, but there are WAY too many uptight posters everywhere!|`|dYyiG90caa	Religion & Spirituality    It's difficult to give one's Opinion, without getting "bashed" IMO.  .|`|tdMgMX21aa	R&S    You don't even wanna know what's going on up there...  Trust me, been there done that...|`|SvMMtzm4aa	I am working on making Gender & Womens Studies a more fun place to post questions on......  Probably not at all but am having fun in the process!  LOL    The politics section seems very uptight - more so than the Gender and Womens Studies because of polarizing viewpoints and not enough people in the middle, etc.  Independents, Centrists, Libertarians, etc.|`|lIadofH9aa	lol  by my experience, definitely politics.     for a fairly laid-back crew, I suggest the R&P section of Music.

1EMG1gS0aa	Stairway to Heaven.  |`|A3UftwH9aa	Even though I'm not a fan of Zeppelin, "Stairway to Heaven" is simply a far more superior piece of work.     I simply cannot stand the abomination that is Southern Crock.|`|PJcIRTOAaa	I'll go with Freebird, for the killer guitar playing at the end of it, but Stairway is a great song, with great guitar palying in it as well.|`|8vgs8owBaa	Hard to choose, both awesome songs, but I prefer Free Bird by Skynyrd, because i love the riff and the piano ostinato is great.|`|l3BSTndkaa	FREEBIRD!!...guitar solo is legendary.|`|t0Snr7WTaa	I think Free Bird is better. I love southern rock. |`|EALy7X7Gaa	FREEBIRD!|`|HGnWKRzyaa	 Stairway|`|VEXKm1Obaa	Damn thats a hard one, mainly since they both are awsome & they both have been so overplayed that I can barley stand to listen to them anymore.    I'll pick Stairway since everyone else picked Freebird. I'll also pick it since its the highest grossing song of all time.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Neither|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Stairway.|`|c1gihmF2aa	Stairway to Heaven Zeppelin kicks ASSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  |`|e8851b9f0ff261603f2a648b1ce253ccaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXG83p2nk...|`|tVb7lMwMaa	Man, I don't think you could have chosen two better songs to use in this question. Kudos! They are both incredible, but if you have ever heard the 14m08s version of Freebird (not the 7min or the 10min), they you would agree with me in saying Freebird all the way!!|`|AA12358335	Personally, I think that both artists have produced better songs than these two, but I realize that for whatever reason, the general public has glommed on to these two as "anthems."    With that said, I NEVER liked Free Bird. So I must, by default, pick Stairway.|`|7vtQnIsTaa	AAughhhhh, NOooooOOHHnooooooo, AAUghhhhhhhh.      AHughggggggghhhhhhhh. NOOOOooooooo, PLEASEEEE, Oh God.    (Snifel) (Tears) (Pain) AAUggghhhhhh, NOOOOOOOooooooo, Oh God    Please!! AAHHUuuuggghhhhhh (Pain) (Tears) (Sniffeell) (Pain)    OOOOhhhhhhhOHHHohhhhh GOD NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!    Okay, I was just imagining listening to either one of those songs but after all that gruesome Pain I may as well make a choice I didn't go through all that for nothing    Freebrid - hands down
1EMG1gS0aa	I like ZZ top better on Chicago... but I dig Johhny Lee Hooker's version of La Grange ten times better than either song :P:P:P:P:P|`|PJcIRTOAaa	LaGrange all the way, although Jesus Just Left Chicago is awesome too.

When that album came out, my older sister played La Grange on a portable eight track player on the school bus every morning and the whole bus sang along-even the driver.|`|WvPxW03Daa	La Grange, Im listening to it right now on the Radio, Thats F*ckin Wierd.|`|qi5lRf9Haa	Jesus Left Chicago|`|5d1b02ab1bdd8a707c44ed1acdcec31daa	LA Grange Uh hahaha|`|MpKirNeBaa	La Grange, but they are both good.

Usually they are near a  water source with plenty of fish, or there are fruit trees indigenous to the area they are in.  There are plants they can eat and they have rice and fresh water and fire.  It is up to them to figure out how to use things like that to their own advantage.|`|Sdksii5Saa	Probably. But I doubt the producers or anyone cares. They think having them starve brings in views or something|`|AA11519707	It depends.    On season 1, Sue Hawk made the final 4 and only lost 3 pounds.    No one has died or suffered permanent damage to their organs from the "Survivor Diet," so it must fall within acceptable limits.    But Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Courtney from Survivor: China really seemed too thin to even start the show and by the time they made the final 4, they looked really bad.  Especially Elisabeth, who started to lose her hair (that's more about malnutrition than weight loss).

X9PoKz2iaa	Families with children under 17, as of Dec. 31, 2007 will qualify for an additional payment. Some people with no tax liability also qualify. This includes Social Security and Railroad Retirement beneficiaries, recipients of certain veterans payments, low-income workers with earned income and/or benefits of at least $3,000 and individuals who have combined income of at least $3,000 from any combination of these sources.    A: You wont get a stimulus payment in 2009, if any of the following apply to you:    You dont file a 2008 tax return.  Your net income tax liability is zero and your qualifying income is less than $3,000. To determine your qualifying income, add together your wages, net self-employment income, nontaxable combat pay, Social Security benefits, certain Railroad Retirement benefits and certain veterans payments.  You can be claimed as a dependent on someone elses return (whether or not you actually are claimed as a dependent on someone else's return). For example, this would include a child or student who can be claimed on a parents return.  You do not have a valid Social Security Number.  You are a nonresident alien.  You file Form 1040NR or Form 1040NR-EZ, Form 1040PR or Form 1040SS for 2008|`|elECfJ52aa	I do not see anyone getting anything at the moment  But this is a good question as long as you work you should get some of the loot|`|qlcY8aKFaa	you don't work.

26896be25b9fe83bcef7859a07b98f01aa	Barber and Pachelbel were already mentioned and both are GREAT choices.    Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" and Sonata "Pathetique" are both lovely.  Both are on the Immortal Beloved soundtrack.    Glen Miller - Moonlight Serenade    Trumpeter Chris Botti's album "When I Fall in Love" is excellent.    Cheesy but lovely, the piano solo of "My Heart Will Go On" (I think it's called Sketching Rose or something) from the Back to Titanic CD    Not instrumental, but some of Morten Lauridsen's choral music is wonderful for touching background.  The Los Angeles Master Chorale performs a lot of his stuff - the Chansons de Roses and Lux Aeterna are both good.|`|543cd57211a5193057db9dcdfeb9a937aa	My absolute most favorite classical peice -- which I cry to when I listen to -- is::    Samual Barber's - Adagio for Strings|`|AsaJma6Caa	Bach Strings Sonata in E Major check Itunes|`|AA11788591	sigur ros's ( ) album  brian eno|`|AA10092369	Pachebel Canon in D.

LOL! |`|KlkUj6uFaa	Taking into consideration she was sick and all it was really bad to listen to her singing. I don't think she has a great voice at the best of times anyway, but she totally murdered that song. She should have stayed out of this weeks competition if she was still ill, and that song choice was not good for her at all, but I thought the mentors choose the songs, not the contestants.|`|0wCToA0Aaa	i loved it!|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	YES! YES! YES!  she did...

Like a Cranberrys pub singer .Stop swallowing your voice !   She's just so twee and. Irritating.   Here's a tip Diana, stop talking before you drag' oowweet every sentenceee you saaaay'.

But to be fair coldplay sing it really well and i think the song sounds best sung by a man. Dont think any artist should re-release that song its a trademark of coldplay.    Il say was a good effort though on Diana's behalf . . considering her illness and problems|`|9OcEJNQkaa	Yes ...... but she murders every song. |`|UlC8tGltaa	she ruined it. and shes crap. i dislike her.|`|96c966b8691bf8b7a40ea9fe0d761803aa	Unfortunately yeah, I agree, it was murderation. |`|a18866a5fa9b1011516eec55c6df35e4aa	it was terrible    why is she still there?|`|OPzH4ih0aa	I don't know.

If she's not better next week then she deserves to be out, ill or not.|`|v6PH726Oaa	I that song could have potentially been amazing.    But it wasn't. It was bad, really bad by the standards she's been setting.    Her confidence was gone, and so with it went her sparkle and magic.    I just pray that it comes back for next week, or we're not gonna have a very good winner this year.|`|ByWRzuuraa	I loved it :)  Diana 2 win.  xxxxxxxx|`|6XKIZNJAaa	I don't think Coldplay should take it personally though, don't forget she's murdered every song she's "sung" (I say sung, I mean yelped).|`|1739d37859293508b7cfc8e53ab0c413aa	YES YES YES

We rescued the donkey and took it to a beach.  the guy said it had been shipped in by smugglers illegally to work on the beaches.  I felt sad that the donkey would be put to work giving rides to kids on the beach so i went back home to ask if we could have a donkey.  my wife said yes so we converted the garage into a stable for the donkey which we named John.

Same with my dad, I hate when he shaves his mustache because he looks like Mr. Potato Head without it. (like when you take his mustache off).  - Some guys look funny WITH facial hair because they don't have enough facial hair to do anything with it.

THAT is a blessing for sure (after all, I'm also Retired Military --  I have some horror stories about dependent spouses next door that I do NOT care to ever repeat (has to do with too much alcohol and those who sleep around)).|`|opy27yN0aa	well i know the dude next door is getting more than some  :P|`|qvW5ZYruaa	Hahah i bet nobody can beat me!     My mum took in some lodgers (credit crunch business) and didn't realise that the two Polish 'sisters' were actually a couple. You should've seen her face when she saw them kiss in the kitchen.

I heard the wife and husband next door have sex for 3 hours straight....the lady was moaning like crazy  I also heard the husband singing a Miley Cyrus song in the shower....bleah......  I heard the wife talking about how her boogers were a weird color....I was like,"What the crap....?"|`|A4qtTlKSaa	I live in flats, i can always smell what the couple opposite are doing (or smoking).    My partner used to live in a terraced house and every now and then we'd hear the guy next door just start screaming. AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...    It was very strange!|`|it3ecbVEaa	Only when they Sneeze, he sneezes really loudly, i could when i lived in a terraced house, i could here everything...|`|qcuXR1Msaa	They're watching David Attenborough shows.

It's kinda normal to do that.|`|wmBK9uASaa	A natural human instinct to have pre conceived ideas,combine that with word association and you have an Image|`|I6CIURO3aa	haha true except in the states i think we have a different image of Boris  and as far as Victoria...ummm well theres victorias secret haha|`|HKQ7wBtdaa	thats human mind....  and its not weird|`|JmdnlQsHaa	It's even more weird that most of the time they look nothing like what you thought they would.  I guess it proves why you should never make assumptions

Having a baby as a result of this "shared bathing time" will cost a lot more money than what they'd save on the water bill...       ;)|`|AA12216521	i share a shower with my husband, although it's not really to conserve water, but hey if it helps.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	Yes.  No more farting in the tub.|`|CEwV9Kf2aa	Baths?

It would be good if more did. I did, with girlfriends; and some do with family members or friends.|`|DP3WRLIaaa	Well, parents might make their young kids share baths. But if you wanna save money, there's thousands of other things you could do.|`|XS0ltAYaaa	I don't bath ...... yuck ........ washing in my own dirt is disgusting. I shower & yes I do share my showers.|`|4qjSQ84Eaa	hm, i can think of a few people who i wouldn't mind saving money and water with.   lets hope so.|`|gJeiACu5aa	ummm....no as most people take showers these days and taking a shower is probably using 20 times less water than a bath|`|zwZoxgFGaa	why not|`|eQjkP4oMaa	-gag-|`|sQrE2hRRaa	If the bath is to get clean that is gross, for other reasons sure why not.|`|JJLplMrwaa	doubtful |`|aIakDSstaa	no amount of money is worth burning yourself on the hot tap |`|wmBK9uASaa	They should, my wife and I have shared a bath for the last 10 years....|`|fHxpycJSaa	Yeah, not like those morons on the Cialis commercials sitting side by side in different bathtubs.|`|8uIfskigaa	mmmm sounds like a good idea, I know someone wouldn't mind sharing a hot bubble bath with.. |`|mggll8dRaa	Just like The Romans and The Population of Sodom & Gomorrah, right before Their "Downfall"...!!

aXL79jHgaa	You most literally say: r-r-r-r-r-r-r when you're playing. Two tips: make sure that the growl is backed up with a powerful and fast airstream, and never growl the same pitch in the same octave that you're playing - they tend to cancel each other out, and all you get is this gurgling sound.     hmm practice makes perfect.  Dont give up.|`|td6y2cYVaa	place the open end of the sax near your mouth and say GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR........im jk i don't know|`|3cabac692db9d78087fbf369e03c009daa	The easiest way to do it is to make sure that your mouthpiece has a nice wide tip opening, then while you are playing the note, you hum.  It doesn't matter what note you hum, but that's how you do it. Easy to describe, harder to do.    Keep practicing, it gets easier!|`|d15ab3cde931f6645aa9088f5f957c2eaa	Yep, just hum.  Experiment buy varying the pitch.

We used to go shopping, have game night, invite them for dinner, just hang out, share good times and bad. Someone else came along and now we are no longer close. She has taken to text messaging me, instead of calling or emailing me. The only time I do hear from her is when she needs something from us or asks us to do her a favor. I despise that and I am not willing to be used in that manner. I mourn the loss of my friend and wish things were much different.|`|7519fc1b983905d71a352ebef866085daa	i'm in love with a person who has different race and religion... and i don't know if we can be together.. because he told me that his ex has the same religion as i... but they could not be together because his parents can't accept him change his religion... so i'm quite worry...will our relationship last forever... i love him so much...

9cc9d1b1db5e5452f3279720cee18e87aa	Believe it or not I was an extra in the movie Born on The Fourth of July.  It was filmed in Dallas, Tx. I was an anti war protester. If you have ever seen the movie I was in the second parade scene. It`s when he was coming back home from the war. I was the one giving him the bird ( Tom Cruise) and shouting profanities at him. That`s is truly the way I was back then. I guess you could call me the villain or good guy. Just depends on the way you view things. Yes, I`ve changed my ways somewhat.  |`|9S76GkXkaa	nice one.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	The good guy, because it fits my personality better.|`|TZZ6LviJaa	Most certainly the villain. The best costumes, a safe way to explore the Dark Side, and a chance to laugh evilly and wear capes without getting strange looks from strangers.|`|AUxHmud6aa	oh the villain for sure.......|`|fFVAr5Idaa	I play the good guy in real life, so I'd probably want to play the villain. Plus the villains look better in lots of movies. I use to find vampires and some bad guys sexier, lol.|`|Bh6NwFzeaa	OH Yeah, The Villain for sure. I love to be bad to bad people.  Edit for Redman. I graduated from Massapequa High School. That was a great movie. It brought back a lot of memories. Did you know that Jerry Seinfield , Joey and Mary  Jo Buttafucho also graduated from there?  Alex Baldwins  Father was a coach and a History Teacher. His sons went to Berner High a couple miles away.|`|mggll8dRaa	I'll Be a 'Good Guy', For a Change....lol...!!|`|MH8cR5bhaa	I have been good my whole life so it is time to be the bad guy..
xg05uSlKaa	YES! Sadly it does now as much as it use to! People keep on living and acting the way they were brought up! Not to offend anyone! Because these people are a very small minority,and getting smaller all the time!!|`|zyIKleE7aa	Of course it does, that & racism will never go away|`|3da8818f1b538bab7d343b90171547c2aa	Of course, as long as there are human beings around there will always be sexism in one way or another, no matter how subtle.|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	it exists in all countries. the mindset of the males treating women as mere sex symbols is to  change|`|mggll8dRaa	Yes, But more of BOTH Ways Now....!!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, it does. The average salary for women doing similar work is considerably lower in the US. Also there is a glass ceiling for women to achieve higher position|`|h1mYSXFdaa	yes, that's why we have a black president and not a woman president|`|Syn6WhZBaa	hell yes |`|M2UWOTAjaa	Yes, but there is much less of it. In some ways women have gone over the line about what is acceptable behavior at work. If I put porn in my locked drawer and the women find out about it, I could be fired for sexual harassment, even if I never even spoke to any of the  women. I also have a little trouble with women as managers. Women pay more attention to details and they also believe in following all the rules. Guys are looser in this respect.

She didn`t actually lift me, but she stood still and steady so I could push down on her and get up. From the time she was a pup, I was teaching her stuff like that. It came in handy this Summer.

I love dogs too, but the horse is by far the most useful.  He can provide transportation, companionship, protection, fertilizer, hard labor, and if worst comes to worst, drink, and finally food.    The horse is of all God's creatures, by far the most noble.  They are beautiful and very vain.  They know they are beautiful, and will not tolerate disrespect.  However, if you ever win their complete trust, there is nothing they will not do for you or with you on their back.  They will charge into the Gates of Hell, without so much as a waver of turning.

v78HSkAcaa	If you buy a fake one you could just reuse it over and over again. You also don't have to worry about cleaning up after it and having to get rid of it.     On the other hand, you'll miss out on the fun of picking out a real Christmas tree. You'll miss the smell of it. But of course, you'll have to buy a new one each year.

There is nothing like the smell of a genuine Christmas tree - no sprays or candle scents can truly duplicate it.

BEST MEATLOAF I EVER ATE  1 tablespoon butter   1/4 cup minced onion   2 cloves garlic, minced   1 1/2 teaspoons salt   1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper   2 pounds extra-lean ground beef   3 slices bread, toasted and crumbled   7 buttery round crackers, crushed   1 egg, lightly beaten   3 1/2 tablespoons sour cream   1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce   1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided   1/4 cup milk   3 tablespoons ketchup  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic 5 minutes, until onion is tender. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.  In a large bowl, mix the onion and garlic, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce. Gradually stir in the milk 1 teaspoon at a time until mixture is moist, but not soggy. Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.  Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).  In a small bowl, mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, and continue baking 10 minutes.    EDIT:  Except instead of the tomato sauce I just use ketchup in the meatloaf and on the top. (no tomato sauce)    nfd?     |`|zGAGZKY5aa	  Freshly made Fettuccine Alfredo    Fresh & Hot out of the oven Sun Dried Tomato Bread|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Kielbasa|`|1tlgYKROaa	potato soup|`|NXrYtxFmaa	a blanket salad.|`|a503ca7b384144f0d57b951d1c7637b2aa	Brownies and Vanilla ice cream *YUM*|`|ugzcxnzKaa	Mashed potatoes or any pasta/noodle dish.|`|gvBPobdIaa	Chicken.|`|XbZIicftaa	Chips! ... and sometimes potatoes (baked, fries, etc.)|`|a1rigtenaa	Apple Cranberry Crisp with Vanilla ice-cream|`|TaTCbLSzaa	CHEETOS brand hot fries or hot cheetos with lucas and lime|`|OI29tkSoaa	Pop corn |`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I like to mush up stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, andcranberry sauce all together in a Tupperware thing, heat it up, and eat it out of the container, like Thanksgiving in a Box.|`|6ad1dc296ecb7c905f1e7277c442d32baa	tofu|`|qbEISHTNaa	chocolate, pizza, chocolate pizza ;]   (ha, actually that sounds pretty disgusting) |`|AA12094990	Anything chocolate|`|RN0zRPH4aa	hmmmmmmm........a pot roast.

Whenever we are facing the sun our faces glow   Then we do know how the time does really flow.     The markets are down and the recession we have found.  We find the markets are surely enough, a big round  Zero, of course I neednt have to discuss and feel,  How ignorant a person today yourself you reveal.    Some know the share markets intricacies and inner nuances too,  But those who lose out are ignorant blokes, like me and you.      The share brokers make hay as their sun shines, whenever the markets fall,   Its guys again like us in folly whose hopes remain tall.      So once again my friend as usual I warn you now,    Please do stay away from the share market somehow.   You shall then run around to save your shaven head,   All will be sorry if you are going to be dead.    Time alone is the master of all that on earth we do,    Best we should know all thats about our due.    Be sure to always remember Time is not your slave but your master  So the earlier you realise it, you can run that much the faster.

iVv6bFW2aa	I don't gossip too much but there are exceptions. Like the  National Enquirer story about Sarah Palin being unfaithful to her husband, or if somebody is wearing a wig, for example. You could also consider gossip when friends bring me up to date about other people we may know. But gossip can be very destructive, and even out others at risk. So I avoid that type of harmful gossip;.Some people say that women gossip more , than men, but I find that to be a lie. Men and Women gossip equally.|`|MVT34FZsaa	Nothing.

KIG9gWY0aa	The answer is yes.  I have done that very thing.  Once again, thank you for the memory and the laugh.  I had a girlfriend in high school who invited me to her home for dinner and to meet her parents.  Her mother made Hawaiian pepper steak.  This contains a large amount of bell pepper.  I am not a picky eater, but bell pepper is one of the few foods that I can not stand.  I ate my plate with a smile but I was dying on the inside.|`|kTc3bfrRaa	If its  not cooked  right I  say  so..       but if its  the  food I dont like  I  wont  eat it  from  the  begining.|`|5JqCObDSaa	Yes I probably would. What helps is if there is more than one thing you are eating(like a meal), eat everything you like and then eat as much as you can until you are full and just say you can't eat anymore because you are full. That way you are not lying. There are some people that would appreciate the truth, then you can let them know that it is something that is not to your taste.|`|54E62nd5aa	Yeah do it all the time.|`|V0GKHeivaa	Yeah|`|dT60YBulaa	First of all I don`t eat something I don`t like, and I would kindly tell the person making it not to make me a plate but thanks anyway, I`m sure others will like it...|`|slMIQcWMaa	No. Eff that shet.

I do end up with a pile of napkins next to my plate sometimes..***chew & wipe***|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Yes!|`|8SKpsVG7aa	nope|`|FXnHE7mmaa	No...I just would not take what I know I don't like.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	No. Nor would I expect them to have to eat whatever I make that might be too "out there" for their tastes. In polite company the host asks if there are any considerations to be made for dinner.|`|EQP8VZwiaa	Yes, I've done it before|`|MH8cR5bhaa	No. If I don't like it, I won't eat it. I take a small bite first and if it is good then I will get more.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	yes if the person as gone to the trouble of preparing it i would  enjoy the day|`|iVv6bFW2aa	It depends on the situation. I don't like chicken, or celery in my salad, but that I would be able to eat in order not to offend.However if I found unexpected bone fragment in a meat stew, or gristle that I couldn't possibly eat. I would eat everything else on the plate and then if asked about not eating the meat, I would say that I am allergic.I would never say I don't like the food because that would be bad manners.|`|uOcqI1miaa	Yes and I have|`|uSNn3iJDaa	no I'd politely tell them I don't eat that..|`|OsT64mqMaa	Depending on what it was..

But if it was ALRIGHT, but not great,  than yeah of course.|`|tvdabilNaa	Probably, if it doesn't involve offal or fowl.|`|PIUzpnVkaa	depends. if it was meat (i'm vegetarian), then i wouldn't touch it.|`|21hxcVyLaa	No|`|ty3J7aluaa	I have before. Really depends on the person. For most people I'd tell 'em I didn't like it.|`|xVmrrPEfaa	I love this question!    It depends on if I just don't particularly care for it or if I am grossed out. If it is a mild dislike, yes I will eat it out of respect. But if I am disgusted by it, I just can't eat it. I might push it around my plate, chop it up and bit and then say it is just so filling that I can't eat another bite!     I have never told someone I didn't like their cooking/food. Food is a gift and I would NEVER say I didn't like a gift.|`|RYhlcOneaa	I might try, but honestly if I don't like it I can't swallow it.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	NO!

Just dye it black. You'll look great.|`|5qeZIg7aaa	ooooo! I love your hair!! You look like someone I would hang out with!     I really like it screwed up and you have a really pretty face!!!!     maybe just layer it a little more and bleach the top layer. then add a couple of purple extensions or purple and black coontail extensions.     that would look wonderful. Then maybe put a couple of clips in it! wonderful! |`|ox4MdqcVaa	Omigod, your style is so cool! I luv ur clothes.    Your hair looks great the way it is, but I bet you can pull off the other style too. It's your call. Like, if you do the longer one and don't like it, you can just cut it off. So if you want give it a try.|`|PK2mFkQ5aa	nah, that hair style ever scene girl ever has. its just boring now. i would say keep what you have, or change it if you want, but dont make it look like how it is in the picture.|`|D3fsk3SCaa	I don't really like your hair.  The other girls hair is really nice though.  Your hair looks short, so yeah, you'd need extensions but aren't extentions a bit hair to manage.  You can mimic the hair style with short hair.  It won't look exactly the same but it'll be nice.      Edit: okay thanks for the 2nd picture of yourself.   You're hair is rather nice.  It's really short! So yeah get extensions if you can manage them.|`|BC1VXQjWaa	leave it the way it is- it looks good |`|2rGTBWw7aa	your really pretty !  anyways i love your hair , not every girl can pull off shorter hair, and it looks great on you !   keep it (:|`|QQdOpG2xaa	first...  you're so pretty! ah!  okay...  i like your hair like that! if you want to change it up, try dying in a deep chestnut red, it still looks brown, but has a tiny hint of dark red, very pretty!  if you want wild put some red or pink streaks in, i think you could pull in off! haha  *i also think that if you want extensions, it would look good,  but i like youre hair the way it is! very pretty, and frames you're face!  =]|`|J0kTsg8Iaa	leave it|`|HuhI1IlJaa	keep your hair the way it is|`|NGFgKGeLaa	no, don't get that weird hair and look like everyone else. i don't like scene style at all. i know this one scene girl at my school and they call her "raccoon girl" cuz she has too much eye make-up. |`|UGY2CnHKaa	you suit short hair & going from short hair to long hair will just look fake.|`|9F8V6Bwtaa	You would have to wait until your hair grows, but I would go for it if I was you. That kind of hair looks great :)|`|siQ0hkVAaa	I like the ohter girls hair, but its not that original, I like your hair too, maybe get extensions, but not as long as the pic. because that would look wierd going from hair as short as yours to really long|`|m6QkfiZ9aa	first of all, you're really pretty. *jealous* ;)    and second, i like the hair the way it is, it fits you nice.

So letting out your feelings within a poem is always a great way of showing what darkness lies within you. But if this man is cheating on you the best thing you can do is leave as fast as possible. But keep up these poems of your and show your true self in a new life maybe it will make things easy on the grip of your daily life.

AA11112418	All fingerings from the above break (B/C/C  in the staff) are nearly identical to the saxophone (until the C above the staff). These same fingerings apply to the lower octave for the saxophone just without the octave key. The embouchure is different because you need a tight and "high" embouchure on clarinet and saxophone is a lower one. Unfortunately music instruments are expensive. If you want lower price, I'd say renting is the best option unless you want to drop $1000 or more for something quality.    And as for Ebay, do not use it to buy instruments unless you know exactly what you are shopping for. Most of the instruments on there are pieces of crap that you'll spend more repairing than you paid for it, and you'll probably have to buy another horn to play on while that one is in the shop.|`|475c6253e1c25a8313efb22736868bd4aa	Wow, I play clarinet and wanted to play sax too!  Think of it this way; the fingerings for alto sax are the same as the upper register of B-flat clarinet.  So that part's not a problem, you just have to get used to it.  As for finding a cheap one...I got mine for $500 at a local music store, and it's ok I guess.  Try going to a pawn shop, they usually have instruments there.  You can also go on Ebay and look at their ridiculously low prices =].  You might be able to find something worth the time on there...  Like I said, I did the same thing.  Sax is a really fun instrument, and it won't be hard for you to learn.|`|d15ab3cde931f6645aa9088f5f957c2eaa	Fingering-wise, saxophone is easier than clarinet.  Instead of a register key on the clarinet raising the pitch by and octave and a fifth, the octave key on the sax raises pitch by simply an octave.  The 'break' on the clarinet (the middle Ab, A, Bb keys) take a lot of pratice to smooth out.  Saxophone has its own issues, but are generally simpler.   As for a cheap sax, a lot of people find ebay useful.  I would much prefer to be able to play a sax before buying it, but if you go the ebay route find a seller with excellent feedback and you should be ok.

Pull them out right away so terrorists come in and are like "wtf.  we won I guess" and then they will go plan for something bigger which they won't come up with.|`|eA817mGoaa	we need to get the f*ck out of there. we should be out by one years time. this stupid political war has gone on for far too long. too many innocents from both sides are being killed, and for what exactly?|`|xLFaN7KUaa	when we have achieved orgasmic victory, then we can pull out
AgvkO91Gaa	both. I put honesty and thoughtfulness into my answers and therefore expect the same in my questions, though people don't always give it to me. I don't care how many answers I have if I have one good quality answer. But, it's fun being benefited with the points system. Though, I would still be on Y!A if they chose to scrap the points system. I do notice though in both answers to my questions and other questions, some people you can tell are just answering for the points. I do, though, appreciate being chosen as best answer because it means I answered well, and that my answer was good enough to be chosen as the best. Some things are ridiculous, like answering 'I don't know.' If you don't know, JUST DON'T EVEN BOTHER ANSWERING! That's what I say, anyway.|`|Ectn7tkSaa	I always answer just to answer regardless of the points.  Sometimes I know the asker wants people to agree with them and one of these people will get picked as best answer but i always say my true opinion.  I am not going to lie to get the points.  Anyway, I have to say that the best thing to some out of this is meeting the people I chat to so the points really don't mean that much.  I would still be on this site even if there were no points to earn.  I think it is fun and i hope at least occasionally i help someone.  |`|6ozmjp3xaa	Only until I could give thumbs up|`|HmQzOLv6aa	sshh..I enjoy the points and best answers I receive here. So its a big thing for me.

The points rack up themselves, and I don't pay too much attention to them.  I do like it when I get chosen Best Answer, because I feel like I connected with somebody, but I'm totally not a points whore.              |`|ksA5WBEBaa	hi i jus join for this Yahoo Answers and for myself it es does matter becus this tell me tha t i needeng points for to get to next level in the sistem . it es a good web site do u say yes ? can u pleas tell me what are teh questoins on my usersname click ?
a4fddaf6a1e7cc689b0611f98a1c96acaa	No, the United States is in a recession, but I do not think it is headed for another Great Depression.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	Great depression had unemplyment rates at 25%. I don't things are that bad...yet.|`|FYNXch4faa	if thinks carry on like they are, then yes.    but luckily, it hasnt made any differences to my lifestyle for now.|`|frjSBxzBaa	we are about 6 months away from one if you ask me|`|sgx8c6Coaa	Yes, absolutely we are going to go into another Great Depression. It might be immediately - it might be 2-3 years from now. But the way the economy's going, I'm almost positive we will.|`|bb6f5c98e5ad6a19b9c7b09e398b2418aa	Back in the other depression, when the banks went under, they changed the laws so that banks cannot loan out more than 10% of their money and the FDIC insured deposits, so that should have fixed the problem.  However, now a days so many people owe money on cars, houses, and credit cards.  If the economy turns around in about 6 months, there should be no problem, if it doesn't, we could have another depression.|`|mzNLfY4Caa	I have lived in Mexico, in a house with no central heating system, a leaky roof, shots being fired outside my house, cops not giving a crap about anything, and thousands of women being raped murdered.     A christmas party is being canceled?     I think I will be fine. Seriously.|`|kej0H1AXaa	There won't be another great depression with the kind of unemployment of that time and the desperate struggles and such.  Just won't happen.  Some people will suffer harder than others, but it'll only be a small percentage compared to the widespread struggles of the 1930's.  The economy now is very good compared to what it during the depression.|`|2MlJ5OdYaa	Yes, and it's a little frightening.    But I'm not giving up.|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	I don't think we're heading that way yet! But if we keep going the way we are than yes we will be that way soon!|`|v7O1Vzpsaa	Thank God I'm not having that much of a hard time at this time, but to my believe we might get there soon (to another great depression) and I think in a way or another we are all being affected by it!|`|g3UDLOhgaa	While I dont think that it will be as bad as the Great Depression of long ago. I do feel as if the economy will get worse, and lag for awhile to come. More job loss, more economic downfall and many on an already stretched government help (ie- food stamps, tanif, Medicaid etc) the near future doesnt look pretty, but I do not think it will get as bad as it has before.|`|QuVEq8eKaa	No I don't think we are about to g through another great depression, because we have been in the middle of one for the past two years.|`|QEqGukjZaa	its more like the end of the world..|`|XTExSyv5aa	I am now. The company my husband works for canceled their Christmas party and didn't give a Christmas bonus. We're just happy they haven't taken away their excellent health coverage, so it could have been worse|`|3FFAIMpLaa	Yes and I fear it's only going to get worse over the next 6 to 12 months.|`|19nQDjEmaa	100% yes! Things are getting worse and worse!

h1IYS0dbaa	I got a phone call by a person with a "funny" voice. I thought it was my friend fooling around at the phone. I made the same "funny" voices. The "funny" voice was from a friend of my parents with laryngeal cancer...    Ouch!|`|m1JyB08Raa	i pooped in my white jeans and had to walk to blocks to my house.|`|JD3yWKNGaa	At the end of the day when everyone was at their lockers, I tripped and landed on my crush who earlier that day found out I liked him! Everyone saw and my books went everywhere. It was awful, but yours is pretty bad too!|`|HE3IkyL8aa	I ripped the skirt I was wearing as a part of my halloween costume.   So I was a fairy princess in boxer briefs.|`|6JcodrClaa	When I was around 18, during holidays in Izmir,Turkey, I was caught in the act, with my girl-friend, by my uncle...I was alone a couple of days in this appartment while my parents were in Kusadasi (beach resort), and I wasn't aware that my father gave a copy of the key to my uncle...  That was a shock, of course...I think he was certainly the most embarassed, as he tried to pretend not to have seen the scene...  We both still uncomfortable now, each time we meet up, even though I am an adult now...

AA11777868	It should have been either Nuttin But Strings or Queen Emily. They were robbed.|`|AA11519707	The only reason Queen Emily getting fifth was wrong was because she should've been cut a LOT earlier.    She had a good story to gain support, but she screeched and had no control over her voice.  She may have been more talented than other acts there, but she was horrible to listen to.  If ever there was someone Simon Cowell would've told to stop screaming and just sing, it would've been Queen Emily (had he been a judge on AGT).|`|rnUymjdCaa	im with you man nuttin' but stringz shouldve won

The German Shepard had been shot in the scapula at one year old, was hanging with the Coyotes....Had his front leg amputated (He was too young and too smart (with the exception of his 'running mates') to put down)....  He'd jump on me with his front leg, and was SO affectionate. Both dogs were always SO glad to see me pull in the drive. They were excellent watch dogs....Some folks were afraid to drive in because of the German Shepard....He wouldn't hurt a fly....The Border Collie, on the other hand....wasn't the friendliest thing to strangers....

The Law's need to be changed so the people have rights where you live otherwise it will never change...I believe that you do have some rights by writing a formal complaint to the Philipines Prosecution Services, they must follow through with that complaint...if the officer cannot justify the means by his act it can have severe ramification on the Police Force.|`|eqC5Sklqaa	I'd smack him back & not be sorry about it.    But you are assaulting an officer & can get charged... Ooops...|`|a0n9QXUraa	start a riot!|`|AA10025581	Don't do whatever it was he smacked you for.|`|JOS3DdLdaa	Dont get yourself in that position in the first place dude!|`|hGGkV1JPaa	If you weren't doing anything I'd question why the cop smacked you.    |`|p3yNlh5paa	Knock him the fxck out lol|`|AtcOW2Alaa	Thank him/her and ask for another.|`|bAiqgWDEaa	I'd smack them back out of reaction, i'd probably be too mad and not think of the consequences! |`|tGp2g8hXaa	you should contact someone the news whatever; and stop getting in trouble also|`|GQFR2aU5aa	but then ill just curse him out but im a minor so he would probably get in trouble for hitting me too|`|1NLBiHZmaa	Im a skateboarder and cops tend to get really physical with me, its ok to rough them up a little bit|`|OJUJBTJHaa	sneeze on him.|`|x6A8pcmtaa	gta style|`|Q5BM2POnaa	Fire is hot.

In the US that is against the laws...but yeah in other countries it can be different..unfortunately. |`|sY7g3ttPaa	do a barrel roll|`|a2hQELDGaa	nothing, then you get charged with assaulting a police officer and the courts always believe the cop.|`|BuwXOXiiaa	I wouldn't respond in kind at all. No, instead of slapping him, I would punch him so hard that he really would end up looking like a pig.|`|tEbjBSyoaa	If there was a friend of yours there as a witness you can sue him for a lot of money if it was for no reason that is,even if it wasnt its still assault,excess assault|`|7fb39440114b82920e68327fb2c9cd4caa	Just because they wear a smelly uniform .they think they can punch you..Hit them back,your probably get charged or maybe your sue the Police.|`|V1XNY519aa	i think it depends on why the cop smacked you. right? like if its for  pulling you over when he thought you were drinking and driving, when you werent. and smacked you, id have something to do about it. but if you actually, say, did commit a crime, then i guess you deserved it.|`|JOuomnisaa	SOME cops are on a large power trip.  The trouble is, they DO have power over you.  They can make up a lot of crap about you, plant "evidence," beat you to a pulp and claim you were resisting, whatever.  And they sure can get you put in jail.  So much as you want to smack em back, resist the urge.  This is one case where you need to swallow your pride and take what he dishes out.    On the other hand, AFTER you are safely away from him/her, you might consider filing a complaint with the department.|`|MJnF0pfFaa	Smack that prick . Nobody messes with Julie. HA    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HO That's not funny.|`|1T8LfR9laa	If you smack him back, be prepared to at the minimum spend the night in jail.  I wouldn't be surprised if he whooped your a* .  It's your word against his.  If it seems to be legal, it doesn't look like you'd have success in reporting it.  I would assume I would control myself and be on my way.  Karma's *****, what goes around, comes around.

Hate is a strong word and passionatly used, so is love. Both people use and sometimes need.    Love is always needed though, it helps us get by in life.|`|ix8FPa27aa	No  Hate, it seems that when you hate you have/need more reasons to, then when you love.|`|QazJZyg2aa	No. They're both just feelings.

Read the first chapter of "Against the Tide" by former Senator Lincoln Chafee - here is a link:  http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story...     Talk about a political ambush!

I paid with my debit card and after I got through pumping I went to get into the car and a black man stopped me from closing the door and told me he needed $20.  He wouldn't let me close the door after I told him I didn't have any money.  He could clearly see that I did have twenty bucks and he wouldn't give up.  Adrenaline kicked in and I gave him a hard uppercut, he fell backwards onto the ground and I stomped on his throat then flipped him over and held him there for a few minutes till the police got there.  The police handcuffed both of us until they reviewed the video tape. They let me go and arrested the guy for attempted robbery.  The guy got 2 years and the Judge yelled at me for doing what I did.  She thought I should have just gave into his commands.  |`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes,I was actually mugged, threatened with a knife by three youths. The police came, recovered my watch and he was sentenced to probation as a 19 year old first offender. He was stupid enough to wear green clothing, which made him easy to recognize.I was asked by the judge if I objected to the sentence and I said no. Both he and his mother thanked me.|`|4EkE8eebaa	I was riding my bike at night from the city one night and then all of a sudden, this guy comes out with a huge bag on his back saying "hey, do you want to smoke some marijuana?"    I peddled far away from him as fast as I could. I live 20km from the city, just to give you an idea of how far this could be and this was near where I live.|`|s6HJgBm5aa	no sorry|`|l6PwEKq4aa	nope

UZoVc44xaa	lmfao!!  i can just see you, being hit by a car almost dying and you're like  'omgsh! i haven't shaved my legs!'  lol.  no i don't shave my legs incase i get hit by a car ;)    |`|jPld03Tlaa	uhh ur really weird !!|`|zoKDTgTmaa	Aww man, why'd you have to tell me that? Now I'm gonna do it to! :P|`|gKfdrK3Laa	I don't worry about shaving my legs but my mom always asked if I had on nice underwear. She said that if I had to be taken to the hospital that I would want to be wearing a good pair of underwear that didn't have an rips, holes, etc on them.|`|AA11388665	I shave my legs...  BEcause body hair is gross :)  And I have A LOT of guy friends :/  But that kinda makes me smile :)|`|27v21PNWaa	i never thought of that exact scenario but yes i do imagine something will happen and i wont have shaved legs and sometimes its ridiculous stuff  i actually thought i was the only one who thought of this|`|sFtPK9MDaa	I always clean my room because I think what if I die tomorrow and my rooms dirty and my clothes and underwear are all over my floor haha.|`|FHBpJ3qvaa	i do but imagining that i had 2 go 2 the hospital.|`|iJzlRCkOaa	Er... no.    I'm pretty sure that if I got into a car accident, people would care much more about my health than if I didn't shave.|`|b7w8JaWzaa	i think theres alot of other reasons girl shave their legs but i find yours quite funny lol|`|VXCCjdZhaa	Welp, when your bladder empties down those smooth legs, I'm sure it won't really matter to the EMTs.|`|49178f1466ec5d626a8fc1819b87282eaa	um... no.  that's being paranoid.    and i wouldn't laugh about being hit by a car.|`|rDmB2qIPaa	I always shave my underarms and legs.   lol thats such a strange way of thinking. |`|JsWsXeEIaa	what lol!!|`|T5LgCu5Qaa	LOL no! But now I'll worry about it!|`|223ddd171a5a8fff50d94bbbc612c2a2aa	lol, ur funny. but no, i dont  shave 4 that reason =]  That never even crossed my mind =]|`|Mo5xfgOnaa	Yeah, cause that helps when you sh!t and piss yourself silly from  the accident. Believe or not it happens very often that people soil themselves because they lose bowel control. So I'm sure the paramedics will admire your nicely shaven legs as they plug their noses while removing your body covered in sh*t.|`|MmwGkMGOaa	Yeah haha I always think stuff like that =)  I've seen people unshved and it's soo nasty... I never want anyone to see me like that |`|mVqvqoz5aa	I actually used to think about that too. Then I had my daughter and now I only have time to shave one leg if I have any time at all. If my legs are unshaved and I'm on the verge of dying, I'm sure a little hair wont bother anybody. But I always have clean undies on. :)|`|ZEXGmO5Zaa	I never do that  That's creepy that you'd even think about that.   and if you were ever in a wreck your un shaved legs would be the last thing they'd notice.  I'd think you'd want to shave for yourself.    So my opinion is no it's not a girl thing =-//|`|Kno1eWE1aa	Im not a girl, but you shouldnt be thinking like that. It leads to anxiety.|`|VinojPs3aa	Well if I'm almost dead I really don't give a **** if I haven't shaved my legs.|`|oHQMV7mFaa	If I got hit by a car I would have better things to worry about than  if my legs are smooth or not.|`|556ff3a43b50e76832a4625388fba758aa	This is totally the reason I always wear clean underwear!    Edit:  Really?  Thumbs down?  Would you rather I be stinky and wear dirty underwear?  :D|`|k9qwXoJcaa	lol, thats funny. i thought about passing out for some reason and someone having to loosen my clothing so i can breathe.. thats why i always make sure im shaven|`|ix8FPa27aa	Nah, I'm obssessed with wearing clean panties "in case I get hit by a car"|`|fXJhl8TKaa	No - but I always make sure I have on clean undies in case I'm in a car accident.  My mommy taught me that years ago!  |`|wDA6iefDaa	and don't forget to wear clean underwear !!  (mom always used to say that)...|`|bce81f5d2edad38b250e3df6f6922927aa	I have thought that about going to the hospital before.   My mom had to go to the hospital for an emergency xray and didn't shave, so I guess that is why I think about it.|`|zarcvyYlaa	Haha I actually do!! I know what you mean. I always think what if my house caught on fire, or something tragic.. and they find my body.. all hairy eew hahaa|`|zZOfk2P5aa	Hahaha, I thought I was the only one. I imagine the doctors taking me to the O.R. after a car accident and pulling up my pants, only to see my unshaved legs, ewww. I'm sure that's the last thing that would be on my mind if that actually happened.|`|abd8afd4f37f3b93deb9751c1b21750daa	hahha...nice joke..its a joke, right?    |`|9aEjKzKCaa	ahahaa never thought of that|`|gELUbPnAaa	well, its obviously a girl thing to shave her legs lol.    i like to keep em smooth all the time, but i definitely shave if theres a chance i get some a.s.s.|`|436967c7f59cde6f3bd6382a592a7c7faa	lol no... I just shave them for the sake of not being hairy.|`|1YNFFfmWaa	I always do anyway but I think like you do, what if this happens, what if that happens, then it leads to OMG.

Can you add music?  Old Silent films usually have some music to add to the mood.  She could be pushing the cart around the store picking up items and he can show up at the end of isles.  Or behind her as she turns around to see because she thought she heard something or someone.     It sound like a cool project!

Pues algunas veces las personas que estan molestas con alguien, aplican lo que llaman ley de hielo, es decir no te pelan, por que de alguna forma hiciste algo que no les gusto.    Ahora bien si es alguien que te gusta y que no conoces muy bien, si pudiera decirte con eso, que no eres muy de su agrado y en ese caso lo mejor es alejarse, pues no se atreve a decirte que de alguna manera tu presencia o tu forma de ser le molesta.    Tambien cuando una persona solo usa el tipco yo hice, yo esto, yo el otro y no deja que sus interlocutores hablen, tambien ignorandote es como manifiestan su enfado, pues en una coversacion debe saber escuchar tambien, no tan solo hablar.    te sugiero hacer una analisis de tu forma de ser y actuar, puedes preguntarle a un amigo de confianza o algun familiar y tratar de cambiar aquellos aspectos que pudieran causa enfado en los demas.    Si la opinion de las demas personas sobre ti es buena, entonces no hagas caso al que te ignora y simplemente alejate de el.      suerte.|`|XcHmJc0caa	si a esa persona que te ignora si|`|JrXId9D9aa	no creo es mas bien que te quiere demostrar que no le interesa saber nada de ti.  salud.0z|`|dTZVEZxbaa	Mmm hay muchas cosas puede que si o puede que no no siempre les caeras bien a alguien y x eso ignoran.    cya     saludos    Dakkuz|`|2wDJmluOaa	no forzozamente, tal vez efectivamente no le parezca interesante tu conversacin o tu prescencia, pero el hecho de ignorar a alguien lo que significa es falta de educacion|`|3rAhxVsmaa	mmmmm creo que aburro jijijijij    me ayudan amiguitos: http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|oIYEKWwMaa	Quin te ignora amigo??

We're already seeing cars running purely off of electricity, and alternative forms of fuel coming out of the woodwork's on a continuing basis.    I think that in 50 years we'll have android/anamorphic machines in our homes, most of us would likely have transitioned off of fossil fuels for transportation, and we'll likely have the ability to send "thought" to our computers vs using our hands to communicate...|`|33vLqUceaa	All movie rentals will be download to your TV. I personally believe that in the future, there will be much more government control. That is control over spending and selling, when you can worship, putting more restrictions on privacy, and making more personal information avalable to electronic databases. Every penny you spend will be tracked and taxes will be automated. I don't see paper going totally away, but perhaps greatly reduced. Home telephones and cell phones will merge into one system for both mobile and land lines. Automobiles will have greater reporting abilities such as current and top speed, driving habits, current location in real time, crash avoidance by automatically steering and or braking to avoid a collision. Your car could tattle-tale on you by providing its speed to a nearby receiver that would generate an outomatic ticket that would immidiately show up on your car's computer screen. Bio readers would replace keys altogether. You will be able to purchase items directly from your TV during the commercial inwhich it is being advertised on the spot. Homes will be automated. Your house can learn your habits having to do with electronic usage such as lights, tv, music, appliances, etc. Also a lot of the electronics that you use will communicate with each other while others will be integrated together, essencially tieing your whole house and family together. Getting away from it all will virtually be a thing of the past. Everyone will always know where you are and can contact you at any time even when you are on vacation.  That's my answer in a nutshell.|`|N9xfuDWlaa	50 years from now, we have solved the global warming crisis, but due to over population, its either we start reclaiming more land from sea, so find a way to live on the moon, or mars.    Medical technology would be so advanced that the average person could live over 90 years old. And because of advanced supplements, people in their 80s are still pretty much very active and still working. This will cause overpopulation and job disorder.    And with the world relying more and more on robots, jobs would be harder to find. That is why the moon and mars project must be completed to satisfy human needs.    Yes, there will be flying cars by then. Actually, there are flying cars exsisting today. But still ptototypes. You no longer need to go shopping, buy or rent DVDs, nor go to adopt a pet. Everything can be done on line, either on your PC, Cellphone, or even TV.    Technology would be so cheap that everyone around the world will be able to access the internet.    Lastly, humans would finally, holograms would replace actual mouse and keyboard technology. My fav!

St anger c'est pour le public ricain.    Pas fan des G & R, je prfre les albums d'Izzy qui sont pas mal.    AC DC je suis super fan de la priode Bon Scott, pour le reste je suis pas trop interress.      Quand on voit des groupes comme Deep Purple qui tournent encore, c'est pitoyable aprs on nous sort des albums BANANA, la faut arrter les vieux c'est plus la mme poque, plus la mme pche, c'est plus le mme public, mme Rammstein ?a devient limite.

AA11112418	You need to take into account the key change (If the alto is in G major, the Bb instrument will be in C), and then what note it is sounding. Always use the "Rule of C". This is that if a transposing instrument (e,g. saxophone, clarinet, etc) plays a C, the sound they make is the key of the instrument (e.g. Eb alto sax plays a C, the sound is an Eb). This helps you know that if you want the saxophone to sound a C, you need to write the music lower (e.g. to sound a C, the music note will be A). It takes a lot of practice to do the transposing correctly, and the best way is to just dive right in.  My question to you is, what flute are you playing that is in Bb? A flute is in C, not in Bb (except for a few rare exceptions).|`|d15ab3cde931f6645aa9088f5f957c2eaa	This is more of a question than an answer, but Bb flute??

The secret to having a happy & successful one is to be surrounded by good people and be doing the job you want to do; both of these I think you have already. The fact that life is sometimes confusing is what makes us grow - both as individuals and a species. Life is a challenge and our job is to pick our way through it as best we can, and then help others through the maze after us. I leave it to you and others to write the instruction manual for that! |`|cL0nIUdjaa	The confusion in your life does determine wither you leave a health life confusion does alot of thing to your body I would inmagine |`|CPaJg4ywaa	Yes perfectly all right.

UBkQ459Jaa	If it all comes in one box, then it's considered ONE rental...    However, most come by episodes.  Usually it's 3 episodes to one disc.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Last time I did you had to rent each disk separately.  So if there are 6 discs in the set you will have 6 rental fees.  You can pick and choose which ones you would like to see.|`|ZCnVXMZAaa	If you're doing the online rental thing each dvd in the set counts as one rental and they are numbered in order. So you have to rent the dvds in order one at a time, or you can do three dvds at a time if you want. You can read how it all works here:    http://www.squidoo.com/mail-dvd-rentals|`|AA11057445	If you want to rent a series from Blockbuster, like Lost, or the Sopranos, you rent each of them as a separate entity.  Disc one with episodes one through three, disc two with episodes four through six.. And so on and so forth.    The smartest thing to do, renting in-store, would be to become a Rewards member.  If you pay ten bucks initially to sign up, you can go in Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, and if the show's been out for a year, you can rent one, and then get one, for free.      The BEST thing to do is get the online service.  Blockbuster or Netflix, you can pay one monthly fee and have them sent to your house.  It actually works best for just these types of situations.  For a six disc set, you might pay fifteen bucks in-store, but you could pay that to the online service and watch two or three times that amount of movies for the same price.

dd30d07061d6ae74b156e18ca10ad7e2aa	I go barefoot year round. We have not that many days when temps are below freezing but I have learned to remain barefoot even in the rare snow we get here. Keep the rest of your body wrapped up warmly, and you can stand much lower temperatures than you might think, although I'd advise you to keep going next fall rather than taking off your shoes now; it helps to work up to it slowly as temperatures drop, rather than jumping out into the January cold all of a sudden. Give your body time to adjust and when temps get near and below freezing, don't go far without backup (shoes in your bag or a place you can go inside).|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Honestly, it doesn't matter to me lol.|`|6UlOorwMaa	I'm barefoot all day long during the summer!  :)|`|da4zS4AOaa	all the time when i'm at home!|`|AA11082713	Yeah,I love being barfoot...I wish it was summer so bad...xxx    I'm always barfoot around the house.

You should probably respect her and go away.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	False, she will get a restraining order.|`|2vUOqAikaa	False. That all depends on the person. However, I don't think that someone should keep begging anybody to go out with them. You might seem a little desperate in a girl's eyes like that. Here again it depends on the person.|`|st2zmU88aa	FALSE..    if she don't like u that way she don't like  u that way..deal with it. sorry.    if u keep bothering her its just gonna make her not like u at all|`|rQH2J6euaa	oh god, the first one|`|YCmf9fT6aa	She might|`|Ga6P187Qaa	Piss the **** off dude.

sWXwpP09aa	This is stupid. Hahaha.    The whole point of being 'scene' is to be original, but asking for help on a little thing like a name makes you the complete opposite.

Just check for any signs of rust at the ball ends which may cause problems. Wiping the strings with acetone will further help to clean them and wiping with machine oil will help to prevent further damage. Just remember to clean off excess oil properly.|`|AA11262612	shouldn't make any difference, especially for one show. they'll still be bright. dont spend anymore dough, unless your selling the bass.

4875ee8b7cbffd120084702d73bb6ab0aa	He was part of the founding team at both Paramount and MGM. He was a business mind behind the brith of both studios.     per wiki... "Goldwyn is remembered as a ruthless businessman who lacked formal education and his sometimes crude manners added to an explosive temper that left him with few close friends. He nevertheless was a film genius who believed in quality and who not only survived, but prospered in an extremely competitive business"     He also discovered some actos, Gary Cooper, being a notable one.     Hope that helps!

XLMrrgcGaa	He plays a Rickenbacker bass in the "I am the Walrus" sequence in Magical Mystery Tour.  He actually preferred that bass over the Hofner.  In fact, he first used the Rickenbacker bass on the song "Paperback Writer" and used it from then on until the Let It Be Album.  In some of the videos for these songs, he can clearly be seen playing his Hofner, but that was just for show.  In the actual recording sessions, he used the Rickenbacker.    The Rickenbacker bass can be seen clearly in the "All You Need is Love" performance, too.  Paul also used the Rickenbacker during his years with Wings which can be seen in photos from that time period.  As a curious side note, Chris Squire of Yes, used the same Rickenbacker model in the 70's.|`|d515506f6e02bb40beca71f11df22852aa	I believe he always played a Rickenbacker.|`|AA11810119	weird I thought he played the base...

AA12376076	Can't Slow Down  Lionel Richie|`|8d0e89902dbcbbe8bceb1d980be9622baa	Vernon Dalhart's "Wreck of the Old 97" (Victor 19427) was a documented million-seller, with 1925-1934 sales of 1,085,985 copies logged in the Victor files (Jack Palmer, Vernon Dalhart: First Star of Country Music, Mainspring Press, 2005, in press), although it must be noted that is a combined total for two different, but identically numbered, recordsthe 1924 acoustic original and the later electric remake. Despite the existence of such reliable data, several pop-culture writers have claimed sales of up to five million copies for this number, with (of course) no source citation for their grossly inflated claims.|`|AA10773842	I wish I knew...I tried to research it but all I came up with was neil diamond, and I know thats not it.

Lionel Richie's Can't Slow Down was certified 10 times platinum, which became the diamond award in 1999, back in 1985.  Although for some reason, I don't think he was the first artist to receive an actual diamond award.

duRqNtG7aa	Di cosa viviamo? Di acqua, di respiro, di passi sparsi...  di grande teatro, di una promessa, di una faccia differente...  Adoro questa canzone di Fossati, come adoro l'album che ha il suo nome.   E' di una poesia rara.  Pura magia in "Notturno delle tre", che  desiderio, smania, attesa...  e follia, fantasmi, eroismo in "Confessione di Alonso Chisciano", dove in quattro minuti riesce a darci una visione suggestiva, personalissima e sofferente dell'hidalgo partorito da Cervantes.  Davvero bellissima.|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	Mi piace, ma soprattutto per il  timbro della sua voce... io mi lascio sempre guidare nemmeno tanto dai testi, ma dalla voce,  lei che mi cattura o no e  fa s che mi soffermi ...per  prestare  ascolto alle parole .    Di Fossati mi piace "la costruzione di un amore"...bellissima, le parole....    ciao e buon we :-)|`|z8ZNQu6Faa	personalmente a fossati sono legato anchio in un modo particolare..la canone che p mi colpisce e sento molto vicino ..la mia banda suona il rock..magari all'idea pu far ridere, ma riesco ad immedesimarmi in ogni strofa, che  verit.sono contento che esiste ancora qualcuno che se lo ricorda..have a wonderful day|`|f13a383928f185137c089fa578b6cf92aa	Discanto.  Di acqua e di respiro  Di passi sparsi  Di bocconi di vento  Di lentezza  Di incerto movimento  Di precise parole si vive  Di grande teatro  Di oscure canzoni  Di pronte guittezze si va avanti  Di come fare  Di come dire  Di come fare a capire  Di alti  Di bassi  Battiti del cuore  Fasi della luna  E ritmi della terra  Di intelligenza  Di intermittenza  Si vive di danze  Di ballo sociale  Di una promessa  Di una faccia differente  Di mediocri incontri  Di bellezze  Di profumi ardenti  Di accidenti  Rotolando si gira, si balla  Si vive, si fa festa  Quella, questa  Si picchia forte col piede  Nella danza  E si sbaglia il passo  Si vive di fortune raccontate  E di viaggiare  E si cammina stanchi   lavoro   opposizione   corruzione  Si vive di lenta costruzione  E di tempo che ci inchioda  E di diavoli al culo  Di fianchi smorti  Di fuochi desiderati  Si vive di pane  Di speranza di bere  Un vino buono per l'estate  Rotolando si vive  Di discorsi leggeri  Cori  Di maschere notturne  Canto e discanto  E gi divieti  E oli sulla pelle  E sorrisi di fantasmi  E fantasmi fotografati  E gi campane annuncianti  Si vive di sguardi fermi  Di risposte folgoranti  Di lettere partite  Che aspettiamo in cima al mistero  Di essere cos soli    Di questo si vive  E di tant'altro ancora  Che inseguiamo come i cani  Respirando dal naso  Per finire invece  Ancora sorridenti, ancora abbaianti  Di un dolore a caso.      Discanto, disincanto. E' una raccolta di umani dolori, disagi e solitudini quella che Ivano Fossati ci presenta.    Luomo senza radici, come una barca in alto mare senza terra a spaccare lorizzonte, che ha gi dolorosamente tagliato quel cordone ombelicale che d una storia alla sua personale storia e nellimpossibilit di ancorarsi ad un futuro che (appunto)  gi presente.    Com possibile trovare tanta ricchezza di agganci, argomenti, pensieri ed incognite in soli 37 minuti di ascolto?    E come parlarne, contenendo quesiti e idee in un numero decente di parole comprensibili? Difficile: i testi di Ivano Fossati sono lunghissimi racconti nei quali ogni singola parola  una macchia dolio che si allarga, mostrando altre possibili implicazioni, altri possibili significati. E, come se ci non bastasse, il tono di voce imprime alla semplice parola ancora altre sfumature a volte addirittura in contrapposizione con la parola stessa.    Album bugiardamente datato, uscito nel 1990 (no, dico, 15 anni!), bugiardamente, riconfermo, perch di datato o sorpassato non ho trovato una sola parola.    Daltra parte come lo si potrebbe agganciare alla nostra relativa ed umanamente inesatta concezione del tempo? Il tempo  il filo conduttore di tutto lalbum, ma  un tempo che si ferma, si dilata o scorre velocissimo ed inesorabile, in contrasto perenne tra memoria e contemporaneit; nella memoria, da fila ordinata di giorni scanditi da albe e tramonti, diventa calderone di sentimenti ed emozioni, perennemente presente; nel presente, invece, il tempo  vissuto come futuro o, immediatamente dopo, come passato.    Un album complesso, a pieno titolo premiato con la Targa Tenco, nel quale le parole sono fiumane che non danno tregua ed il tentare di fotografarne il senso diventa, almeno per me, unimpresa decisamente ardua e allora, tanto vale,  iniziare subito.      A me piace perch nei suoi testi ci sono frasi che si adattano alla mia vita al mio pensiero, e perch attraverso queste liason posso fare delle sue canzoni la colonna sonora del mio sentire...
Np9NmLpGaa	Not exactly a rip-off, but it is not an official release.  The site below still lists the first season as not yet available.      I asked one of the "live salespersons" at the site and she said "our entire DVD's are taped from the aired episodes on television."

AA12087131	Well I think the Spongebob creator, can't remember his name, is running out of ideas.  Spongebob has been on for 10 years!  But yeah, they're getting a little dumb.  I hope they make better ones.|`|JnSrN3guaa	i love spongebob!<br>  <br>  actually, i feel sort of the same, but i still think they're funny.<br>  maybe its because we're getting older, you know?<br>  my brother used to watch it with me, but now he thinks they're stupid, just like what we're sort of thinking. . .that's something to consider.[:<br>  i used to love barney, and now i think it's disgusting!<br>  and i used to love a lot of stuff, but i'm getting into more serious stuff, still funny, but more grave, you know what i mean?<br>  <br>  i love spongebob forever, but yes, i think that the new episodes are kinda *whooo!*, but i do think that we're getting older! =]]<br>  :D|`|81SHaBnZaa	Honestly I never really liked spongebob. I mean, he's funny, but his voice make me dizzy and it hurts my head. He bothers me now and I just don't find him funny anymore
qEQfiQfcaa	you'll never forget him, in your case, he has hypnotize u, you'll never could forget him, he'll always show whenever u forget him and your feeling will on surface again i mean your feeling will haunt u down again. i'm scorpio boy and i also had connection with taurus girl, i hope u don't hate him or you'll more and more deep digging your feeling, you'll never be able to forget him. my advise, just enjoy your live and don't waste your energy to forget him, or maybe this boy love you but I don't know, it's his feeling. If you want to know what his intention with you, just get his trust i'm sure you'll understand his feeling|`|QA5RKVMJaa	Then do it. Taurus are the masters at ignoring people. Stop focusing on everything wrong, and ignore him. When you focus on the problems, they blow way out of proportion, and somehow find a way to multiply. Focus on what you want instead... reassign thoughts about him to oblivion.|`|1ShTAEiVaa	Something really similar happened to me once. I really hate this guy now, because he's kinda silly and really infuriating. I used to be okay, but then I started acting weird, like going a bit blank and getting all fidgety, when I walk I kind of skip/jump. I seriously cried, and I started hating the guy because he's so troublesome. I was so angry and hurt because I knew he hated me...    Anyway, this is about you. I'm still kind of struggling, but it doesn't matter. you should just share it with your closest, most trustworthy friends first and see what they think. You feel a lot better when you tell somebody the whole story. Then maybe you could form pictures of him in your mind and rip it in to shreds virtually. That's what I did. Oh and you could try and think about other things, focus on your work, spend time with your family. Fill your mind with other stuff. Then it wouldn't hurt as much because you don't really think about him as much. Focus on other things, and he'll go to the back of your mind.|`|DbNbWQflaa	just like the rest  block them out and know there will be another one shortly along the way,,take it as a learning experience,|`|6vlNSK3uaa	Haw haw!

I believe you will find this to be true. Find someone, and do something nice to make them feel better.   I bet it works for you. It could be as simple as giving someone, in your life, a big hug and tell them how much they mean to you. Can you imagine that if everyone in the world did this, for just one person, what a better place this would be!

I always like to talk to a certain close friend of mine that helps me out with any problem I have. If you don't have one of those people in your life,(and if you are religious) seek God's advice. I know when there is something that feels wierd to share with even my closest friends, I can go to God for all of my problems. Read scriptures of hope out of the bible....     Hope this helps out :)|`|ovvYTOhBaa	little kids make me happy and calm. there so innocent. also comfort food. drive over to KFC and grab something that looks like a it will certainly give you a stroke. go home pop in the little mermaid, or a comedy flick.....I did this today, got me some of those addictive crack fries and some heartburn   biscuits and I watched a Dane Cook comedy show.|`|Ch5hniY2aa	I listen to positive music|`|J7ZDjaCGaa	AWWWWWW don't be sad be glad :0 lol i stole that from a glad commerical but anyways,  wat cheers me up is hanging with my friends, or just one of my friends complimenting me and telling me how much they appreciate me.

4f771e245bcd9d69341c7bb78e7e3cfdaa	"Do stars really effect our lives?"    I do not believe so. Science has proved that there are billions of stars and consellations in the universe. Back when people throught the Earth was the center of everything people would study stars closest to us and attribute them to months of birth.    Of course it is foolish to assume being born in a particular month determines who you are as a person.    Everyone is different, and these differences are determined by our reasoning, lifestyle and experiences.|`|b1b3472d676e9936d78fe0968d48908baa	Whether or not stars effect your life, on the one hand, and knowing what's happening in your life, on the other hand, are two completely different considerations.     Having said that, I can tell you what you can expect from YOUR future: your future will look more and more like your past. Your future will be more and more repetitious and predictable.     Just as your past is known to you now, so will your future be known to you thru the filter of your past.     You can answer that part of the question yourself, better than anyone else can.|`|OJGlgUYQaa	I can tell that I am really a cool person! And so are you! yup all this from your birth date! sup chica!|`|c04a2760cfaad46d448ef0faf21e4588aa	Hi. My name is christen. And for the past 10 years I have been telling futures and pasts. The stars can play a big role. In the past I can see that you struggled to find yourself. You might have been brought into a group that you shouldn't have been into. But in the future I see fame but be careful that fame might just put you back into that group that you don't need to be into. Just email me at vanessannehugdens@yahoo.com if you have any more questions. I can help you find your destiny. So just write back.  Much love,  christen

3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	It ties neck-and-neck with "Ikiru", in my book. Totally different stories and meanings of human heroism. An amazing performance by Takashi Shimura in each film, remarkable cinematic storytelling, heart-rending yet stirring endings...  The Seven Samurai will teach you about courage, honor and comradeship. Ikiru will teach you how to be alive.|`|575cb6b1cf5b6852adb2d2d72dec74dcaa	I also like Rashomon and Yojimbo.  You ever see the movie the Magnificent Seven.  This is a knock off of The Seven Samurai.  Toshiro Mifune is still one of my favorite actors.|`|AA11839143	Well, I like it, but it isn't my absolute favorite, and since people tend to define "best movie" by their own personal tastes...Yojimbo is Kurosawa's best in my little world.|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	I liked "Ran", it  was an excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear";  but I think "Dreams" (his final movie) was his best on many levels visually.      The short stories, made for a jumpy plot, which is how most people dream.  The huge advantage to this was you did not get bored or lost in one single plot.  If you didn't like the first story, you could just wait 15 minutes to start the next one.  Think of it as a smorgassboard of a film a try sampling each piece within the film.
eypioHM4aa	i totally agree with you and NO WAY have i been voting for Sanajay..........if he wins then american idol would have lost its meaning.|`|WWpDR7HUaa	personally i don't think the voting matters...cuz in the end they rig it...the proof is in last years show...Chris Daughtry(among others)...i don't vote anymore...the shows a joke|`|uPFfycOoaa	Howard Stern's radio show is telling people to vote for him.  Votefortheworst.com is doing it too. I was SOOOOOO mad when Sundance got put off.  You are right. It is not a joke.  America, please vote.|`|rM2uodoiaa	I don't vote but I watch. Not only is the show a singing contest...it's also a popularity contest and apparently he is popular with young crying girls with a crush..thats who voting for him!|`|AA11415480	I do something but mostly noand who are you|`|AA10435882	American Idol is a great show. And as mentioned before the rest of the contestants are actually good, and actually have a future in the music business. Where as Sanajai "may be actually trying" but he is not good. I think he is going to do weird things (such as the odd hair) as an excuse for all the people who vote for him to screw with idol. Because He knows HE IS NOT GOOD! His sister was better. I don't think all the tabloids should be giving him all the publicity. American Idol has given America lots of great artist, sanajai not being one of them.|`|AA11280073	It's the show's fault for letting people vote as many times as they want. It should be 1 vote per phone or computer.|`|jPOresx4aa	it's not going to matter one bit who wins , the producers only have to give one record deal to the winner ,ONE  for one album    look at the non winners from last season who now have recording deals , Chris Daughtry , Kelly pickler , Katheryn Mcphee , Paris Bennett just to name a few , Also have ya heard much from Taylor hicks ???     who cares if senjya wins|`|AA11359184	And if you think that you are doing Sanajay a favor think again! Let's say he does win American Idol because you keep voting countless times for him. And then he has to make an album right? And he is so happy because he thinks people love him but then....not too many people buy his cd! Then what? Not only is he gonna disappear from this business but you deprived the opportunity of some good artist to make make it into the business.|`|78b7413d1fa5171d9b54b0c81c6af361aa	I'M WITH YOU.

Not everyone is thinking about the fact that some of these people are serious singers and their careers are on the line. And here they're leaving so this fool can stay in. And the ones voting for him don't even like him, they think he sucks too! So actually the hurting the show and hurting him. It's gone beyond a joke. I bet they will change the rules for voting next time because of this stupidity.|`|9a8ad2bd74ef14daf7f98aee3567f253aa	i kno, seriously people, puhlease he sux and its not funny....lots of really good people got kicked out because people think its funny to vote for him!!|`|nvRVLWaGaa	people are all getting in groups and trying to screw over the most watched show for attention. theyre voting for the bad people, not voting for the good. its seriously messed up. and its not fair.

Diciamola tutta: Venditti ha ormai fatto la sua epoca e, onestamente, il suo repertorio , nel complesso, musicalmente ripetitivo ed anche in termini interpretativi non certo strabiliante.  Ma i grandi, quelli veramente grandi, quelli che riescono a lasciare una traccia profonda nel proprio tempo, non necessitano di essere tecnicamente dei geni. Antonello  infatti riuscito, non con una ma parecchie canzoni, ad arrivare diritto al cuore anche "strimpellando" un banale giro di do.

If you want to group system of a down put it in the my chemical romance, fallout boy, greenday and all the other crap with rhythm they are trying to sell as music today. As for Nirvana if you really have to group it with other bands than it goes with Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains. Although all 3 sound nothing alike especially AiC.

edc2efe6707c2bcb5f6f0ee90ff78817aa	Ciao Fox,  bella domanda. Hai ragione, sono belle canzoni, molto migliori di tanta immondizia musicale che oggi viene spacciata come musica.   Le canzoni degli anni 60 sono fondamentalmente semplici, parlano di sentimenti chiari e limpidi, sostanzialmente sinceri. Trovi il ragazzo che andava a cento all'ora, o che faceva la posta alla sua amata fuori dalla latteria, di zingare.   O di rotonde sul mare, di baci al sapore di sale, di pinne, ****** ed occhiali, di montagne verdi, di vie Gluck, di chi non vive senza te, di lacrime sul viso, di spade nel cuore e di cuoi matti ....   Sono le canzoni che quando le ritrovi, sanno di qualcosa di familiare e rassicurante e ti sembra di averle sempre conosciute.  Mi piacciono, a volte le ascolto volentierissimo. Qualche volta penso che erano la colonna sonora dei miei genitori quando avevano 20 anni negli anni sessanta, giravano in Lambretta e 1100 ed al mare andavano a Marina di Pietrasanta. Erano la colonna sonora di un'altra Italia, forse pi semplice ma pi umana.    Te ne dedico una, se me lo consenti, che mi fa battere il cuore.  E' di Patty, ed  "pensiero stupendo"... per te e per chi c'era, chi c' e chi ci sarebbe voluto essere.     Baci        A u r a|`|1da1f243404c8bca1851b65f7f5bdf3eaa	Tony Renis....ahhh....S, mi piacciono molto.|`|ba931d6e9395dd705a2e18fdea0e11a0aa	Si che sono belle.. a volte mi domando come facevano a scrivere canzoni e ad inventare melodie cos belle.

"Nessuno mi pu giudicare nemmeno tu...la verit ti f male lo so......" grande Caterina Caselli!    P.s Mi  tornata in mente una canzone bellissima di Mal che fa "Questo disco  il mio pensiero d' amore...per te...per te...ogni volta che lo senti suonare...pensa a me...a meeee!!!"  Chi se la ricorda? E' fantasticaaaaa........|`|f842b8a406b68e64460d551f86971b00aa	bah....no, non molto.  Troppa melassa.......opinione personale.|`|93557d7e72126f5b5caf9a17d4940a44aa	Si, tanto, e non solo perch le trovo incredibilmente semplici. La verit  che dietro una canzone "vecchia", un profumo antico, una sensazione particolare, si nasconde tutto il nostro passato che resta l in agguato ed  pronto a balzarci al cuore per stringerlo e ridarci la pelle d'oca che ci attanagliava nella nostra giovent. Buon ascolto e .....buoni ricordi !!    Ultim'ora di gioved 8.2 ore 23.33:  Forse ci stiamo facendo prendere la mano dai ricordi, da quelle meravigliose trecce bionde che non siamo mai riusciti nemmeno a sfiorare nella cantina buia come Lucio ci diceva..... o forse siamo noi ad essere speciali perch come ci diceva Peppino " son diventato un sognatore".. chiss!  Comunque, non siamo soli, proviamo gi a contarci in queste risposte diverse solo dai mittenti e scopriremo che a noi la vita sorride, indipendentemente da quello che facciamo o guadagniamo.

Anche a me piaciono quasi tutte  perch venivano pensate pi a misura d'uomo, inteso in un cammino vitale....|`|6ec2310c9fff45e40940682a428e2228aa	Quelle canzoni saranno per sempre le pi belle, quelle che non si dimenticano mai e che non ti annoiano mai!!  Ora fanno tante belle canzoni ma che ti piacciono per un po e poi ti annoiano o le dimentichi.  Anche anni 70 e 80 sono molto belle e quando si ascoltano, si provano forte emozioni.  Tutta la musica  stata gi scritta e se noti quelle nuove si assomigliano o vengono riprese dal passato.  Sono di larghe vedute in fatto di musica la Amo quasi tutta, non c' Vita senza musica,  qualcosa di meraviglioso!!|`|5dWkWh5iaa	Io rivedo sempre con piacere "Sapore di mare", di Carlo Vanzina (1982), che era ambientato a Forte dei Marmi nell'estate del 64.

0FCswHHNaa	adornavo quel film....ricordo che nell'infanzia io emia sorella lo guardavamo senza mai annoiarci.  Ogni settimana a dire poco era in televisione;sai, quelle reti regionali...  mi piaceva da impazzire.  Crescendo, credevo di averlo dimenticato.  Sviluppai comunque una grande passione per David Bowie.fantasico.  fino al giorno in cui il bidello della mia scuola, una persona lievemente ritardata, mi diesse che aveva la videocassetta di quel film.  Il giorno successivo me ne fece una copia di sua spontanea volont.  a volte le esperienze  che si vivono da bambini, te le porti dietro come ricordi impercettibili, sembrano quasi sogni.  a volte vorresti sapere la verit, a volte  meglio che rimangano solo sogni.  Crescendo credo che la magia si rompa, e le cose non hanno pi l'aspetto magico che si ricorda.  Concludendo, gurado a rtutt'oggi quel film con molto piacere.  Ciao|`|02f515339f28161b237fa77052c2435faa	Da ragazzina l'ho visto decine di volte.

Le porte si chiudono e i due si trovano fianco a fianco. Il gigante nero lo osserva dall'alto in basso poi gli rivolge la parola con accento straniero:  "Due metri, 120 chili, pisello di 40 centimetri, palle da un chilo ciascuna, Jim Rati".  Il ragazzo fa una smorfia e sembra sul punto di svenire. Allora il gigante nero lo afferra per la camicia e lo tira su come un fuscello.  "Qualcosa non va?", chiede l' uomo gigantesco.  "Scusi, puo ripetere quello che ha detto?", chiede l'altro con un filo di voce.  "Due metri, 120 chili, pisello di 40 centimetri, palle da un chilo ciascuna, il mio nome e Jim Rati".  Il ragazzo emette un sospiro di sollievo: "Uffh, meno male... avevo capito 'Girati'".|`|ca1fb28750743eca8fd7ce8834ba5881aa	cognome....ti sar difficile dare la miglior risp....:p|`|757e998dde3617e3d90ea9fcb9fec5f7aa	Apparte il cazzo....bo...

E63G2Acaaa	It's like that because they based it on the comic strip version of the event. They should explain that more in the opening i guess but they don't. So it's not the movie but the original person who did the comic you should be complaining to. I think it ws published by Dark Horse Comics.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(comic_...     Listen, I much rather have perferred a movie on the historical event to be taken from the novel "Gates of Fire" which is an awesome book that i prefer. I think you would agree if you read the book, But what can you do?  One based on "Gates of Fire" would have had the voilence, blood, and one liners also but it would have been more believable and fairly honest to the persians.     Don't sweat it.  The movie was based on a comic.  Read Gates of Fire though....Kickass novel on the historical event.  Obviously it is hisotrical fiction also but it is good.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_fi...|`|AA12342607	hell no, somepeople are really stupid, when they want their 15 minutes of fame|`|0edeb715d6b6122dc862202fc0a546d7aa	No. You have to remember that the Persian empire under  Xerxes crossed the Hellespont with a huge army to conquer  Greece, and also had a large carthaginian force land in  Sicily to attack the Greek colonies. What really makes the  Persians look bad is that despite an army of over 200,000  men, and a huge navy, Greece gave them more than they  could handle!!!!|`|c42f0c5c61797a2042d874c261fd2969aa	this is not a real film ! and it show iranian king like a giant but it is not true u can see in this site the face of iranian ancient king : http://www.300badmovie.com/|`|22499940cd0147137b4f931fc3c5e78caa	Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... If you can guess the numbers of zeroes I used in the word no, maybe. Actually no I wouldn't, by the way I put 300 zeroes just for you, I would have used over a hundred million zeroes but I don't have the time since this movie has already made well over a 100 million.  It's a movie, cry me a river.|`|b3ef206316a63415535ad07c3a5bdc68aa	C'mon, noones national pride should get seriously hurt by a comic and fantasy movie. the way myths and history are presented in todays hollywood movies and series has very little to do with the original, everyone knows that. that's why i don't consider it an insult. Greeks should complain about the twisting of their history and myths a thousand times, egyptians should complain because they look bloodthirsty in bible stories when they kick the israelies away, germans should complain about the whole german people looking like monsters in world war 2 movies...   everyone has got it's share. Maybe the arcadians should complain too, because they are not presented to be as brave as the spartans, although the historical through is the 700 Plateans fought and died on the side of the spartans, noone left the battlefield. So in reality there were 1.000 soldiers, but only the Spartans got the glory. It  doesn't claim to be a real story, it doesn't claim to be politically correct, we know persians are not monsters, so don't worry that much. Persians had and have a great culture, it's just the fact that a great power was defeated by a handfull every time they attacked them that gave the grounds for a david and goliath story, that's all. It could have been anyone, it's a symbolic battle. Don't take things so seriously.|`|MDfGfwQhaa	relax dude. if you want to start pointing fingers, at least point them in the right direction. the movie characters were all derived from the graphic novel 300 by frank miller. the movie and all the characters were taken from the novel. so if you wanna petition someone, petition him.|`|AA10724476	Not really.

En la escena, el aprendiz de mago es captado ba?ndose mientras intenta resolver una pista que lo ayude a ganar el torneo Triwizard.    Con respecto a su primer desnudo Daniel coment: En realidad no lo he visto, pero bsicamente, entro a la ba?era usando una bata y en teora estoy desnudo debajo. Yo en realidad llevaba ropa interior color carne, que es el tipo de prenda que uno nunca quisiera usar.    Radcliffe agreg tambin: No he visto tampoco donde ustedes me vern con la mitad superior desnuda, pero he visto cuando estoy justo en la ba?era. Es muy gracioso por el Mirto que gime. Es una escena realmente buena, pero me siento un poco inquieto de verla en el cine.|`|453222ae5387f9d197b91dd69f8d2eb3aa	Si eso ocurre, imagino que lo har en un contexto para adultos, por lo que corresponde a los padres, como en cualquier otra circunstancia similar, verificar que dicho contenido no llegue a ni?os o adolescentes.    Si te refieres a una obra de teatro en la que l sale con el torso desnudo, entonces depender de si la obra es para mayores, en cuyo caso me remito a lo se?alado en el prrafo anterior.      En cambio,  si el contenido es observable por jvenes o ni?os, debes tener en cuenta que el teatro es una instancia a la cual ellos no asisten solos, por lo que pueden ser orientados sobre tal circunstancia por quienes les acompa?en.     Ello, porque quien asiste a una obra de teatro, por regla general, primero se informa en qu consiste la obra, quienes son sus actores, etc.,  por lo que puede decidir sobre  la conveniencia de hacerse acompa?ar por jvenes o ni?os.|`|9b1a6b1919b1a262af134c91c1376dd2aa	los ni?os saben mas cosas que lo que los adultos creen...  el impacto esta todabia por ver...  ahhh!!... que ya salio...  pues haber que pasa...

Bueno, si es del tipo de pelculas que te gustan    Aunque esta basada en un hecho real, tiene mucho del cine de hollywood, tanto en el guin como en el uso de imgenes.

6t2Jxfcmaa	Gli angeli sono ERMAFRODITI!    Ma non per tutti i credo/religioni/culture..    Nel Parsismo infatti esistevano angeli di sesso maschile ( Amesha Spanta ) e di sesso femminile ( Fravashi ).    Ma per caso hai fatto questa domanda perch ne conosci le origini?  nel Medioevo si diceva che si discuteva "persino sul sesso degli angeli"..  ..era un'espressione che oggi ha il valore di discussione oziosa, cavillosa, eccessivamente pedante.    Volevi essere cos? Hehehehe.. :P    X Alex:come me hai torto e ragione nello stesso momento..  in realt ho fatto una ricerca e ho appurato che gli angeli sono MASCHIO, FEMMINA, ASSESSUATI, ERMAFRODITI, ANDROGINI e quante altre versioni puoi trovare,   in base alla RELIGLIONE, LUOGO, CIVILT e CULTURA.    ..Miss insomma che non lo sparemo mai ..

I was hoping to see someone completely random so there'd be some type of surprise. What was even worse was when they revealed Rodney as the killer when he was heading to the Execution Ceremony and then they had him explain all his thoughts. They were wrapping up his storyline which is the tell-tale sign that the person is getting eliminated that episode.    Way to go CW editors... you suck!      That said, I hated seeing Rodney eliminated. He was my favorite on the show. Now I'll probably root for Ted or Shawn.|`|P6QYCC6qaa	i like the show too! and it was rodney who was the killer. he went against leah in the execution ceremony and leah won. :D rodney didn't admit to being the ''killer'' though,which he was :D so now its down to 7 people:nasser,leah,cody,ted,adam,erica, and melyssa.|`|ADPaie9raa	i no 13 is awesome but rodney died so there going to be new killer on loose
QjR5EDfxaa	I have always believed that where we have a Star Trek type of future with the flying cars, laser guns, etc. to be bullshit and just imagination of what we want our future to be like.     Truth is that, future will be just like the past and the present with some minor or possibly major upgrades in technology. The society won't let us evolve past because it fears of a great change. Here we have mature games and movies and the officials are afraid that it will turn the society into chaos and won't let parents or those who are smart enough to choose for themselves what to play or watch.    We are our own worst enemies because we won't let ourselves evolve into better civilizations. Countries that have itchy trigger finger because they're afraid that others might have it too so they won't let go of weapons that are going to be the end of us all.    Maybe I'm just not optimistic that we will have a future where the world is nice to live in and everybody gets along. But the past and the present time really do not show me why I should be optimistic about having good future anyway.|`|rwavfuihaa	blank|`|hme0Cc92aa	I see the world is going to end soon approximately by 2012 or somewhere around there.

G8TPtwxUaa	All of these designations are referring to Fret Barre positions along the fretboard.    The C indicates Capo (barre) and the Roman numeral indicates which fret is to Barred.  The half C indicates a partial Barre, often just three or four strings rather than across the whole set of six.    Some modern classic guitar publishers use Arabic numbers in place ot the Roman numerals, but the meaning is the same.     The bracket above the staff adjacent to the Barre fret indicator (the Roman numeral) is written above the affected passage.  When the bracket disappears, the Barre is removed. Sometimes the word "loco" is inserted to indicate a return to normal fretting.    Cliff E. (classic guitarist)

fE83WcSiaa	These days cars are made a lot better and more than likely a crash years ago that would have made a car catch fire is less likely to happen now, but whether a car catches fire is all dependant on the crash.  For instance a small crash would be less likely to have this happen, but any crash that involves the car turning over always has the possibility that the fuel tank could go, once the structure of the car is damaged the fuel tank can easily have part of the metal warp or split on an edge causing fuel to leak out and then maybe catch fire.    If it was impossible for a car to catch fire they wouldn't tell us to switch our engines off at petrol station even when waiting, anything that has gasoline in it has a risk it could explode.  Hope this helps.  |`|75107d92736ad6fea72a78e30303fbdaaa	cars DO explode as everyone else said, but contrary to what some one else said, petrol tanks WILL explode if you shoot them with either tracer or phosphor bullets from a distance (enough for the bullet to burn) and if it is hit right, they done it on mythbusters, but by the time they managed to do it they had obliterated the tank using conventional bullets (which will not work) so it only caught fire.|`|AWmrFxJ8aa	Utter Rubbish is what you have been told, if there was no risk of fire, perhaps your cousin could explain what happens when the fuel tank ruptures, any spark on fuel will ignte it|`|03a1c5f014f17a1349b0905741877e22aa	look and the news people burnt to death in a car, they only catch fire if the tank splits on something red hot or a naked flame they don't blow up as well did you know when you shoot someone they wouldn't recoil through the air it would just pass through|`|IZX9qdkXaa	I was about to say switch on the news.  Technically it is quite hard for a modern car to catch fire after crashing as many of the components containing volatile fluids are either well protected or buried deep in the engine.  However, like todays unfortunate incident, if one of these components are ruptured and the fluid comes into contact with hot engine parts/sparks, then yes, ignition is possible.  Although cars do not explode immediately (like in the films) if the petrol tank is heated continuously for long enough you will have one hell of an explosion as the petrol vaporises, ruptures the fuel tank and oxidises with the surrounding air.|`|Z2p2EBe1aa	YEAH CARS CAN CATCH FIRE AND BLOW UP IN REAL LIFE!  I SAW REAL LIFE FOOTAGE OF IT ON 60 MINUTES IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME!  I ALSO SAW A GUY WITH NO SEAT BELT ON IN A SEDAN AND HE HIT SUMTHING IN FRONT AND HE ENDED UP IN THE BACK OF THE CAR UP NEAR THE BACK WINDOW IT SCARED ME!|`|IhJV165waa	shes definately wrong.they do set on fire.there was a crash either this morning or last night were a family of 6 died because there car set on fire after they crashed(god bless them ) :-)|`|AA11169105	given the sad news from the M6 this morning, cars can indeed catch fire when crashed, but it is rare. Hollywood would tend to embellish things though, so of course cars explode when they crash. Shooting a fuel tank would not cause an explosion in real life, but hollywood would not be so successful if they mirrored real life would they?    note to poster below....mythbusters showed that EVEN with a tracer round, it is hard to get a tank to explode.... liquid petrol doesnt burn, it is the vapour that needs to have the correct fuel air ratio to ignite.|`|7b6d9b71ec244bad6e5e7cd334ec64e6aa	She's correct, the automatic exlosion you often see in Hollywood like when a car falls of a cliff is not realistic.    It's possible in very very remote chances but the fuel needs to be secure otherwise a car would blow up if you had a bad crash on the road with someone else.|`|UEevDQG7aa	Whereas cars are less likely to catch fire these days than the Ford Pinto of the 1970's they still can all too easily as was proven on the M6 motorway in England this morning where 5 people died..

ee54d7941ce06a3a03190bf5dafca984aa	Allora, cominciamo col dire che nonostante sia stato lanciato ponendo l'accento sul termine assassino e sui delitti, chi si aspetta un thriller in stile il silenzio degli innocenti rimarr deluso.    Non voglio parlare molto della trama, per evitare di rovinare la visione a chi andr al cinema, dico solo che  basato su un personaggio, la cui unica qualit consiste in un olfatto eccezionale, risultando per il resto una specie di alieno,  assolutamente incapace di sentimenti umani, e visto con diffidenza dal resto dell'umanit.  I delitti vengono da un suo progetto per cambiare lo stato delle cose e risultano estremamente logici (Grenuille non  un pazzo, ancora dimenticatevi il silenzio degli innocenti :) ) e in fondo sono del tutto secondari nella dinamica del film (ed  per questo che "Storia Di Un Assassino" come sottotitolo del film poteva essere evitato secondo me).    Il film  recitato molto bene e il protagonista (un'illustre sconosciuto almeno per me) fa un ottimo lavoro considerando che con il suo viso deve esprimere le sensazioni originate dall'olfatto, che ovviamente lo spettatore al cinema non puo' avere.Aggiungo che la protagonista femminile (oddio, non esiste proprio la protagonista, per  la donna che appare per pi tempo)  splendida.    Insomma, a me il film  piaciuto e lo consiglio senz'altro a chi volesse andare al cinema in questi giorni|`|35959fd45a1af269d680e711805ca325aa	no.se leggi il libro prima del film ne rimani deluso.se vedi il film senza aver letto il libro ti mancano dei concetti fondamentali per capirlo a fondo ed allora  noiosissimo.|`|730934e358c7145bc86854346efed315aa	Io l'ho visto sabato, l'ho trovato abbastanza bello  ma non ho idea se sia meglio il libro visto che non  l'ho letto|`|d05e23a8fe7f4cdfb6ca427fcbf8c393aa	io ho letto il libro... da brividi...il protagonista  un pazzo che va alla ricerca di profumi..odori che gli trasmettano qualcosa...e quando lo trova uccide la persona che ha a che fare con quell'odore!!|`|10a178b0ff5529cf8ad2edea385af092aa	l'ho visto 3 volte al cinema,mi  piaciuto molto|`|c92318bf3a5e0d87c0eab0f8bffb8ab1aa	io nn ho visto il film ma ho letto il libro che  molto molto bello!!!  ciao ciao|`|14f1f7553eb183a2e2663f29590ae596aa	Ciao, intendi "profumo di assassinio"? Se intendi quello, come film  carino fino ad un certo punto, poi la fine ha deluso parecchio il pubblico, me compresa. Comunque non immaginarti scene di paura, non  un thriller.    Ciao Ciao|`|9af08c4bd74b5b3a4d1f28686b6ca91aaa	io,se ti interessa,ho letto il libro...carino,in alcuni punti,in altri noioso...il film dovrebbe essere meglio,visto anche gli attori presenti.|`|44d5d14199569ebef69e8d7ba963a758aa	Non l'ho ancora visto. Ti rispondo, per, perch ho letto il libro che lo ha ispirato. Se il film conferma anche la minima parte di emozione che suscita la lettura,  sicuramente un bel film.  La storia  difficile da realizzare sullo schermo perch, al di l dei fatti e dei personaggi, vive di un crescendo di orrore e di bellezza difficilmente rappresentabili in immagini. Forse solo le parole possono essere coerenti con l'animo della vicenda raccontata cos magistralmente da Suskind. Vedi il film ma leggi anche il libro. Ne varr la pena.|`|6f06e938848ebabe4bd1e12cc5523678aa	ciao.rispetta molto il libro che mi  piacciuto molto

His wife rolls over and asks, What in the world was that?    The man says, Touchdown, Im ahead, seven to nothing.    A few minutes later the wife lets one loose. The man says to her, What was that?    She replies, Touchdown, tie score.    The man lays there for about ten minutes trying to work another one up. He tries so hard that he craps all over the bed.    The wife asks, Now what in the world was that? He replies, Half time. Switch sides.

fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	YES.  A rosewood fingerboard imparts a warmer sound to the guitar and feels much smoother when bending strings. A maple fingerboard is brighter sounding and always has a finish on it to stop it from getting stained. This finish seems to allow a more "positive" feel when you chord but I think it feels a little sticky when doing leads, especially when bending.|`|AA10168856	im not a pro, but maybe the feel?|`|AA11973766	not really much differnce just different feel..

Don't beat yourself up for having things as good as they are - the most important thing is that you are clearly aware of what you have and that others don't have it as good as you - and also that you're not greedy for more - so just be happy and continue thinking the way you d because it's the most sensitive and nice way to think :-)

However  I  had an experience  of     coming into  close  contact  of  a village  deity  called      Madasamy  in  Nainaarkoil  Village in  India.  It  is  believed     that at midnight  He  travels in  the village  in a  specified     path  and  no one should  hinder  his  passing.  However  myself     and my friend  were  sitting  on  a  cot  and  were  in conversation     beyond mid night.  Madasamy  is  a Bull-God  and  we  were     frightened  when  we  could  realise  that  we  actually  heard     the sounds  of  a bull  rushing  towards us  fuming  and  panting.     We  immediately  jumped  and  went inside  our  house  and     bolted  the doors.       Immediately  we  heard  the  sounds  of  jolting  and thudding of     the door.  It continued for  nearly  10 minutes.  The surprising     fact  is  that  the neighbours  who  were close next doors  did     not hear  the  sound of  knocking  the doors.       This  continued  for nearly 15 days  and  we  could arrest the  same     after  offering  prayers  to Lord Subramaniya.       Hence I conclude  that  there  are  invisible  forces  around  us     and  presence  of ghosts  is not ruled out.      Gurumoorthy         |`|YbGUaajSaa	Yes.  It was over at my uncle's place next door.  He had bought the place from my grandma, who pretty much died in that house.  My uncle was in bad shape from some broken ribs he had when he fell down the stairs.  I was staying in the downstairs room and couldn't sleep.  I opened my eyes and there was a woman in a flowing, white gown standing there.  She seemed to glow.  She walked towards the center of the kitchen.  When I got to the doorway, she was gone.|`|seJxUXHCaa	I don't think so, ahh, I don't want to either =||`|EbwX8fk7aa	yea      one time i was walking after school and there was a little girl with a roller backpack walking behind me i took a small peek from the side of my eye and she vanished|`|pCfbHDgBaa	No I haven't seen a ghost =)|`|YY806Xn0aa	nope, not yet. i would like to though|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Only in the movies.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	No but I feel like they exist in most of the places I've lived in|`|Ua1OiWmbaa	Not as yet, no.

KMigVppBaa	claire she is the best. like in that scene with west on the beach(there first kiss).this is the scene claire says i think power is so cooler when your parents are yelling you can just fly right out.west says well you can fly without a parachute.then claire says you can fly without a plaNE.Then west says well you can go in fire just for kicks.then claire says i still feel pain i just get over it faster.then they kiss. but those are just examples of her cool abilty. her abilty is not the only reason i like her. she has a good attitude. i also fell bad for her. she has power that she is trying figure out and she also have to figure out her life in high school.high school is the hardest point in your life. like peter said in the episode homecoming it does get better after high school. which all the other people are out of. so they got it easy. she was also popular but now she is a adjusting her self to be normal.|`|a6JNx1tgaa	Hiro. He's the easiest to relate to.|`|qFPiAQigaa	I'm not really sure if he counts as a "hero", but my favorite is Sylar.  I like him because i like his transformation from a watchmaking nerd to a complete brain-stealing badass.  He seems the most real person on that show.  Nobody would really set themself out on a heroic mission like Hiro; nor would they be ashamed of their abilities like Claire.
jR5oQjDSaa	Cancer is the natural ruler of the Fourth House of the Zodiac, commonly referred to as the "House of Family and Home" and known in Vedic Astrology as the "Subterraneous Place.". The name Cancer is derived from Latin, literally meaning 'the crab'. Cancer has the characteristics of dreaminess, intuition, emotion and need for a safe retreat. Also known as the Sign of the Prophet or Teacher, Cancer is Negative in polarity. They also have a certain degree of spirituality. They have excellent memory retention skills. Cancerians are kind, sensitive and compassionate. They are very domestic and love fortifying their home environment to their own satisfaction.    In personal relationship, cancer is a mixture of toughness and tenderness, Emotional, romantic and sentimental on one side, while tenaciously possessive and loyal on the other side. Cancerian has a retentive memory and rarely forgives slights and hurts. A Cancerian will never let one forget one's error. As being driven by emotional nature, they can be the best and the worst of friends.       Star Stone for Cancer   The star stone for cancer is the beautiful, translucent, PEARL. The Pearl can be all the silvery colors of the moon and not just white. The pearl takes on its silvery, shimmering, colors from the color of the linings of the oyster in which it are grown. This precious stone can be harmed if subjected to hair spray, acids, perspiration, and some types of cosmetics.      Cancer Ruling Planet   The moon was called Luna by the Romans, Selene and Artemis by the Greeks, and many other names in other mythologies. The moon represents the basic nature of your instincts and feelings. It has a nurturing influence that gives a deep impression and unique sensitivity within your mind. Intuitive people often have a strong moon placement. The moon has a direct influence on the mind which can be seen and felt in varying ways during each unique phase of the moon. This is particularly hard for those who are slightly unstable as the pull that the moon exerts on the tides is also felt in the brain fluids, making the effects of mental illness more enhanced. This is how the asylums came to call their inmates 'lunatics' as they were worse, or more dangerous, during the full moon.    The moon also brings out the negative side of the cancerian nature which he or she must continually battle in order to overcome what could easily become a major flaw in character causing themselves and others much grief and pain.|`|6a9af04ad67a2dc87b2e07af0da4a2edaa	well im guessing your frustrated with a male cancer?    i dont know i've always been attracted to them ;)     im taurus though so i dont know|`|yA7xEO68aa	do u have a problem wit male cancers???im a male cancer!!!|`|pw8u5WQ9aa	my ex was a cancer sun. he was very undependable, manipulative, & a BIG FAT liar who was extremely moody & extremely sensitive, to every dumb thing i would say. so that would cause heavy arguments between us. oh boy am i glad to be out of that relationship.|`|hOnuu01oaa	Well, if your zodiac sign was named after a horrible disease, you'd be difficult to deal with, too.

Diario de una pasion: me emociono y me entristecio la escena de los cisnes en el lago, cuando mueren juntos en el hospital, tambien hizo que se me saliera una lgrima    pero titanic, te voy a enumerar las escenas que a mi me dieron mucha tristeza.    Es dificil decidir:  1.- Cuando el la pinta a ella  2.-Cuando simulan volar (ese atardecer es bien triste)  3.- La parte donde los msicos estan tocando, luego todos se van y solo queda uno tocando... de repente se van uniendo  4.- La escena de 3ra clase de cuando se va llenando el barco de agua y los viejitos (hablo de otros), se quedan en la cama abrazados  5.-La escena en donde se va hundiendo el barco, y la mama de rose se queda como ida.  6.-La fidelidad de Jack, se sacrifica para que rose viva y se quedan ah platicando  7.- (esta esta muy triste, como las que van despus) Cuando el capitan del barco encuentra al beb en los brazos de su madre, congelados y el dice "tardamos demasiado... sigan buscando, sigan buscando"  8.- De cuando rose trata de despertar a Jack para avisarle que van a salvarlos pero el ya se murio, y le hace la promesa solenme de que iba a vivir muchos a?os y morira vieja en su cama  9.-De cuando rose (ya viejita) se va a la punta del barco y deja caer el diamante, esa escena esta muy triste, no entiendo por que es la que me pone ms melancolico (como todas las que he pronunciado)  10.- Cuando rose muere viejita y acostada, tal como le prometio a Jack, e inmediatamente despus se "regresa" el tiempo y pasan a Jack y Rose en el reloj, besandose y todos los tripulantes les aplauden    Esta pelicula, me pone triste, melancolico y en la ltima escena (10), siempre suspiro, como si de repente me hiciera entender que la vida se va as... tan rpido como un suspiro.|`|74a7291abde789fc98804a6ce4d97537aa	Se me hizo un nudo en la garganta...pero nada de llanto...no llore para nada....saludos.|`|57fbe541b3dc7c951c986d9f9b7b8a18aa	YO; y lo que es mas se me hizo Super ABURRIDA|`|56a70caecd19ee28a0b28a3e0705679eaa	Yo no llore, y es de las pocas peliculas "tiernas" con las que no he llorado...la verdad no s porqu ser|`|0938eb52ab838a962a756b57ff3948d3aa	llorar no, pero bostezar por lo menos un par de veces|`|1ffdc4d143c928ccea58b74f1bb9b977aa	Yo tengo la respuesta y esperare los puntos, "Un Ciego-Sordo-Mudo"|`|9fbc256fb80a071fac1ac2adead774b2aa	YO , NO LLORE......................

So that should answer your question.  Now for something more important why is your pic so dark? Did you forget to use the flash in your camera? You should always use the flash when it's dark. I know because one time I didnt use it and my dad got mad at me. And then my brother hit me in the gut. And it hurt. I wanted to get him back so one morning I poured cold water on my brother while he was sleeping. He was so mad he hit me again. It hurt. Then I told my mom and she made him take out the garbage.

And there is a sweet guitarist they use named Kaki King, she does cool things with guitars and one of the actors, Irish I think sings very nicely.    Moulin Rouge: don't care much for the movie itself so much but its an interesting soundtrack and has Ewan Mcgregor n Nicole Kidman singng lovely ^^    Juno: once again, not super into the movie, but I love the soundtrack. Really cool/interesting songs, like Cat power does a remake of "sea of love" its really beautiful and soothing. Then there's The Moldy Peaches/Kimya Dawson, such an interesting group! The 2 actors even sing one of their songs which I prefer over the original, belle & sebastian, buddy holly, the kinks. Also Mott the Hoople's song "all the young dudes" is pretty sweet! The soundtrack was really made well to suit the movie and interweave the story line with the songs.    P.S. I love you: I do not own this soundtrack yet, but the songs seem really cool, have some nice Irish songs and some sweet ones I think. Seems like a fun yet sombre soundtrack    On a foreign soundtrack note a Japanese drama called Densha Otoko(train man) has a pretty cool soundtrack with some american songs too which are fun. Also some really fun upbeat tracks that are just music.  I must mention 1 more Japanese Drama soundtrack or they are called OST's (not sure why): Hana Yori Dango (boys over flowers): the music, instrumental really suits the show well, it really captures all of the emotion and fits very well aso do most Japanese drama OST's which are mainly instrumental though I love the songs they use in the show, but they are not part of the soundtracks sadly.    Sorry for the length, but felt I must explain(that's my puh(tendency) as we would say in ASL)    I was going to stop there but thought I'd have a look see into my iTunes library and see what I was missing so here are a few more:   What a girl wants: its fun! I didn't buy it, my younger sister did. I don't like all the songs but with The Clash's 'London Calling' and The Donna's 'Who invited you?' and the actor/singer Oliver James lovely voice, I enjoy it quite a bit  Wicker park: crazy movie, lovely songs though the french song by The Stills Retour a Vega I found out is a naughty song = / anyway some great songs though, DCFC, snow patrol, lifehouse, nice song by mazzy star, jamie wyatt which I hadn't heard of and awesome remake of 'againt all odds' by The Postal service.    Phantom of the Opera! C'mon its great! Powerful..    Never been kissed: just some nice songs, semisonic, Jimmy eat world!, remy zero, cardigans, R.E.M. The smiths    Lilo and stitch: again, my sisters, cute-lots of Elvis.    Last, I promise!: awesome indian (hindi) movie called: hum dil de chuke sanam (straight to the heart) its a beautiful soundtrack|`|xMPQV5J1aa	pearly harbour of titanic. anything by hans zimmer|`|IUYaO5C6aa	Goodfellas was spot on.  |`|vPYn5fMPaa	Pulp fiction and trainspotting are good|`|X3m3l1lUaa	man on the moon (the film) cos REM did most of the soundtrack|`|KbL1ToyPaa	The Lion King lol, just brings back good memories from my childhood.|`|oftZ7Sdvaa	Try the soundtrack to "Garden State".

7e3eec1bd80a8591d2bd3f8b4f654288aa	Well that depends do you want to record the actual cassette player or an auxillary input. If you want to reord just the tape player you need to go to an electronics store and get a rca adapter and connect it to your audio out on the tape player and your mic input on your computer. for pc;s you need to buy a software interface such as pro tools or session etc. for macs you just need to use garage band with the adapter.     For an auxillary input same thing except make sure that your tape player is set on the right input|`|cc24486a97ef6a21216237f4049bc294aa	If u have a mac with garageband, I don't know for PC's.

Other than that you could go with pedals for a thick sound I would go boss mega distortion or Ibanez SM7 smash box. I prefer the SM7 go to the guitar store and try it against boss you will see why I say that It looks cheap but it's sound can't be denied. also try cranking up the gain a little when I am looking for a new sound I try to forget what I know I like and just start turning knobs.

E vorrebbero in milioni ballare come lui. Lo sai che a 5 anni praticamente manteneva la sua numerosa famiglia perch era la stella del gruppo che avevano messo su...i Jackson Five ti dicono niente?

Cmq qui stiamo parlando dei video musicali di michael jackson e non del suo aspetto fisico. Sono stufa di commenti del tipo "come puoi comprare i suoi album, ma hai visto quanto  brutto?", lui  un cantante, e il suo aspetto fisico non centra... poi se viviamo in una societ dove solo chi  di bell'aspetto ha un futuro senza prendere in considerazione il talento  un altro discorso...   ora per finisco qui altrimenti rischio di scrivere per ore...

If you just plan to hook up a bunch of effects stick with solid state. Most of all if you can't tell the difference you don't need one. There is something called more money than talent. If you are just starting to play and you go out and buy a $1500 Gibson and a $4000 Marshall stack and you don't know your chords by heart. That is a waste of money learn to jam on cheap stuff and when its time to up grade you will know. The other thing this goes for amps or guitars there is no best there is what is right for you. For example I have played sg's and Les pauls and there cool but not for me. I will take a jackson any day The necks are more comfortable to me and tone wise a match for me where as ESP's fill the same niche and I haven't played one I like yet. Stick with what you got!|`|pGOvVUu2aa	It will be heavier, have a glow in the back and have to "warm up"  before you can use it.|`|ep8y6ou4aa	Tube amps have tubes in the back.  Look and see what you have.  Tube amps always sound better than solid state.  Tube amps cost more, are heavier, and have to warm up.  The only people playing solid state amps are those who can't afford tube amps.

To there good points at one time the changed music for the better. The happened to solve the problem of people downloading there music, Make crappy music that no one will listen to so no one will even steal there album. I do give you credit for having a sense of good music because Godsmack is crap and Three days grace well lets just say I would rather stab my self with a rusty spoon than listen to that crap. So put in your old metallica and listen to some revolutionary music. Or put is godsmack or TDG and be another retard that thinks that the guy from nickelback is a great guitarist.|`|5a8a9566c83ca4d91a8e92a968573ab9aa	They used to be cool.|`|u69cY8Oxaa	haha metallica it was only like yesterday that i heard of them and because i no my music so well i was sitting their talking with my best m8     her : wow metallica are on tour  me: metallica isn't that your boyfriends band  her and vikki : what (pissing themselves laughing)|`|vIElE9kLaa	Metallica was the best when their album Black was released. After that they just withered away.|`|Gd0TBLpTaa	Metallica are the best band ever!  They have so many good albums like Master Of Puppets, Ride The Lightning, Metallica, ..And Justice For All and Kill 'Em All etc, and so many good songs like One, The Unforgiven, Battery, Orion, Fade To Black, Wherever I May Roam, Master Of Puppets, Escape, Fight Fire With Fire, (Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth etc. And that just says it all... aswell, they are an awesome live band (seen them twice)    Metallica, musically, deserve so much respect, not only have they made so many great albums and songs, but they have the balls to do what ever they want, take the album/DVD S&M for example, that is just so good, and no-one else would have the balls to do it, plain and simple|`|AA10811456	The Black Album was the last good thing those guys ever did.

Now they're a bunch of whining babies.  It's sad what they have become.|`|2840f08e64c2c66dcd455094078ea244aa	HELL YEAH ...

Yo creo que es un director que se ha consolidado mas en el ramo de la accin pero que definitivamente tiene el toque mgico para que las pelculas que el dirige queden marcadas en nuestro recuerdo, quien no tiene evocadores recuerdos con el film "E.T"????????

Np9NmLpGaa	As the listing below from the Internet Movie Database shows, it premiered in the USA last week at the Rhode Island International Film Festival.    It is unlikely to be released into theaters since it did not get much business in Canada, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was released on DVD here in the next few months.
TS6eaCjZaa	The movie "Penelope" is not based on a book. It was an original screenplay by Leslie Caveny. The screenplay was later adapted into a book, but the screenplay itself was the original creation.  I bought the book based on that fact, thinking it would be fun to read something based on a movie rather than the other way around, which is usually the direction the Hollywood wheel turns.

Exemple: on peut prdire avec certitude que la combinaison gagnante du tirage du Lotto samedi prochain, sera l'une de celles inscrites dans la liste des combinaisons probables.    Dans ce cas l'avenir est inscrit dans cette liste mais on ne sait pas  quelle ligne !    Un exemple tir de la physique peut illustrer ces propos :    On peut dterminer et voir au microscope lectronique, l'orbite d'un lectron tournant autour de son noyau. Mais on ne peut pas dterminer la position exacte de cet lectron sur le trac de l'orbite, en mme temps que l'on observe l'orbite.    C'est comme si l'avenir tait  cheval sur deux dimensions. Notre parcours global est prvisible dans notre dimension 3D. Mais le dtail projet de ce parcours se trouve dans une dimension extra-terrestre que l'on ne peut atteindre en restant dans la premire.    Un exemple concret pour vous aider : Une bibliothque remplie de livres est un univers fini sans avenir excitant. Mme si on y rajoute des livres, ?a reste toujours une bibliothque.    Maintenant rajoutez un lexique  (reli en livre) de tous les livres de la bibliothque et vous obtenez une ouverture vers un univers nouveau : celui des lexiques qui sont disperss dans toutes les bibliothques.

c1dea546d60c93b33fde44b04960c799aa	Its like parasitic drain the more stuff you have in you pedal chain the more gain your going to loose. This kinda complicated first off make sure that you level/volume knobs on all pedals are adjusted your sound will be restricted by your lowest setting. some don't have levels so you can try playing with the order of your pedals or buy a signal booster pedal it just boosts the signal so you don't have volume loss the other option is buy a good eq pedal and with the level on that you can boost the volume and with a plus only the frequency's you want either way will work. Also high quality patch cable might help. ex monster cable, planet waves good luck.|`|c6ceade3ab2bd870088360cedad2890daa	I think to get a full, proper answer, you have to be more specific.    1.

6AUGMNujaa	wait i got it!  The answer isnt pressure. Kindergarteners wouldn't think of that as an answer. Notice at the end of the riddle how there's a question, "Can you answer this?". The answer to the riddle is simply "No." The reason kindergarteners beat Harvard grads is because kindergarteners are honest enough to say "No I can't answer this." The Harvard grads tried to think of some scientific explanation, but they didn't really look into the question good enough. The real answer is probably "No." Yes, there are explanations like pressure, but the maker of the riddle might not have thought about that. The reason it's called the world's hardest riddle is because people try to think of an answer more complex than the word "No." There you go! That's the best explanation I can get.|`|ITd6SqVkaa	Nope, can't guess it.|`|ZefydJ8Gaa	pressure|`|IrfbapHAaa	um...... i say God/Nature...       but the popping part doesn't make sense with amything i come up with.. so i'm not suree..    ahahah   [=|`|SYpVGGJTaa	air|`|qPJPjrkNaa	No i cannot guess the riddle that's the answer|`|7hor2XtFaa	nothing?|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	The answer is:  No, I can't.|`|DP3WRLIaaa	I don't know|`|XQ55wLDcaa	No i cannot guess the riddle.|`|z8MCekccaa	GOD........  whats the answer?|`|VYDAO57jaa	"No"  the answer is "No"|`|4taqSGjdaa	nothing- everything mentioned is naturally that way. nothing MAKES it that way, it just is.    polar bears are white  nothing, like for christmas or birthday will make you cry  guy pee girls comb hair-naturally  celebrities make themselves look stupid  normal people and celebrities look alike. we're all human afterall  pancakes turn brown  champagne isnt champagne unless its bubbly  things pop when squeezed and nothing...... nothing....... will make you pop just by looking at it|`|3onacSoxaa	Omg how can the kindergarten get this?|`|2k8TEiRtaa	water ?

Because the question is not,  "What turns polar bears white, and makes you cry...  makes guys have to pee, and girls comb their hair...  makes celebrities look stupid, and normal people look like celebrities...  turns pancakes brown, and makes your champagne bubble...  when you squeeze me I'll pop, if you look at me you'll pop...?"

Spend Forever    This time is different  I want to make it last  If we spend forever together  Time will have gone by too fast.    Lets spend forever  Dont ever leave  Well stay together  Just believe.    You rode in on your white horse  Saved me just in time  But the best part of it all  Now you are all mine.    I wanna stay in your arms  You take away all my fears  You fill my life with kisses  And wipe away the tears.    Id give up everything  To keep you around  Cuz you keep me going  And keep my feet on the ground.    Lets spend forever  Dont ever leave  Well stay together  Just believe.    Sometimes we fight  I say the wrong things then its too late  But I know we can do this  Take control of our fate.    Youre the love of my life  When youre gone I dont know what to do  Something just doesnt feel right  Im not me without you.    I want this more than anything  Cuz I love you with all my heart  And everyday my only wish  Is that well never be apart.    Lets spend forever  Dont ever leave  Well stay together  Just believe.    We cant give this up  We cant give in when it gets tough  Because my life without you  Would be a million times as rough    This time is different  I want to make it last  If we spend forever together  Time will have gone by too fast.    a lot more of mine are on mindyourmind.ca.. you should send some there.|`|kMAcj2Zzaa	turn it into a song... it's amazing|`|C0ZiwpGuaa	I think it's great!|`|eGEWxjIkaa	i really like it good work.|`|e7561d2a75135013d4209c1976fc32f0aa	AND YOUR PRETTY LAME|`|pRVCuoAOaa	it's good,   it just needs some working on.|`|538883fcd39d0942ba5976efeb606f4caa	I absolutely love it ,that was extremely beautiful.

Mainly because your in the first month of virgo.  Although your are mainly compatible with these signs in general. The other matches may be really difficult.

Anyway Virgo's in general get along with their fellow Earth signs   Capricorn, Taurus & Virgo. As well as the Water signs Cancer, Scorpio, & Pisces.

U share my birthday! I have gone out with a two sags, aries, and a scorpio. I am still single (ish) so hope that helps.

Seems like aries like us ALOT but they just get on our nerves?!!|`|letqMSoiaa	Virgo Compatibility with the Other Signs  For Virgo compatibility you need to understand a few things. Virgo is the great feminine figure in the sky, a powerful womanly figure and sometimes a very wonton one. A lot of Hollywood sex-pots are Virgos, bet you didnt know that! But Virgo is an earth sign ruled by the communicative/analytical Mercury. A Virgo appreciates your fastidiousness, your crafts-ability, and your ability to make things go a long way.     Virgos are pretty smart to, and practical; but theyre very quiet about their competence, they prefer to be in the background. Virgo is the typical helper and fine tuner, they have a way with things. Without them you couldnt run the show.     Virgo is in polarity with Pisces, they can make a good complementary pair. They both like to serve: Virgo with their skills, Pisces with their soul. But Virgo is ruled by Mercury so they have a pretty affable spirit, able to get along with anybody; they might attract some of those artistic types though like a Pisces.     Traditionally Virgo compatibility iswith all the other earth signs: Capricorn and Taurus, and it has good compatibility also with the water signs: Scorpio, Pisces, and Cancer. Virgo has a so-so rapport with Aquarius and Aries; and there can be some definite trouble (but not necessarily) with Sagittarius, Pisces, and Gemini.

HJI8778baa	Definitely metal.     I used to be a huge fan of rock, but like a bathtub that felt hot to the touch - I've now grown used to [in a metaphoric sense], the hard impact that metal delivers and it's a cycle that brings me to a more intense stage  every time.|`|MYsSyfQzaa	I don't know what genre I like most because I'm kind of a Hybrid of Rocker and Metal-Head. I have love for both.|`|pCHg6y01aa	I like rock.|`|Tj2xROpwaa	Rock but i like metal too. thats hard|`|TSQF1O7Vaa	Metal is viewed as sort of taboo in America.  It has a certain stigma where people think it is the music of the devil and stuff like that.  Although it is mostly hogwash think of Ozzy biting the head of a bat and the notion does not seem so outrageous.    As for my preference, I still enjoy that old time rock and roll but metal is a lot more diverse and interesting from a musical standpoint now a days.|`|AA11939795	I enjoy goth metal and good old fashion rock-n-roll. It's the subgenres I had difficulty with.. like the death and doom, metalcore and sludge and viking and rap metal.|`|qz9trhYhaa	Metal.  Rock to me, is mainstream.  Why?  Because you always here "Today's Top Rock Hits" when its all mainstream crapola.|`|ryg28eX7aa	Rock, definitely. i like some metal, but rock has been part of my life for a long time. I guess my fave is Alt rock though.|`|qAfnWKQCaa	Is AC/DC metal or rock, they were called punk in the 70's. Same for Motorhead. Rock, punk, and metal, more often than not, refer to the exact same thing.         I try not to think in genre's.|`|7lDSkGLTaa	BOTH    Rock-Led Zeppelin  Metal-killswitch engaged,children of bodom|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	some people like softer music thats why they don't mention metal bands, but all the people I am associated with loves metal so I cant relate.|`|rkkIyPoQaa	I love metal. It's my favorite form of music, but I don't like the watered down fake crap that you see on "Headbanger's Ball".  Rock is cool as well, and I generally have the same opinion on that. Too many of today's "rock" or "metal" bands suck and aren't really playing real rock/metal.|`|TlU3zj61aa	Metal. Metal in my opinion is more creative|`|C0ZiwpGuaa	There's good bands for both.|`|bj6IsTfkaa	rock :)|`|X0G16nPwaa	I like a mix between the two like Wisdom In Chains|`|Du84mgPZaa	both|`|Wr0M6K6Faa	Rock|`|3WhNqZ36aa	well i like classic rock and classic metal.   i choose rock.|`|cyOM51c9aa	The sound of the ocean blue fluttering in the wind like a bird with no wings and antlers.|`|LcvdGTu5aa	ROCK|`|sKLY9v9Iaa	Love them both but neither.

XD|`|PQTLOjrcaa	stay metal, kids.|`|LMUwz5y8aa	I prefer Metal|`|AA12374184	Blues, Classic Rock,  Heavy Rock and some heavy metal are the B@(($ but the other half of heavy metal you need all kinds of drugs in you to like it.|`|V2PONyUQaa	I prefer Rock but alot of the bands that I listen to were considered Metal when they first came out (70's - 80's), but are considered rock under todays standards.|`|0vm66wlcaa	Let's see here.  I do enjoy both Rock and Metal.  But I think most of the music I like can somehow be classified as metal, rock-not as much.    In my top bands, there is Jimi Hendrix Experience, Led Zeppelin, Rush, Bang Camaro, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, UFO, etc.  All of those bands either are Metal or have a huge influence in the genre of metal.  They may be rock, but they were some of the first bands to be condidered heavy metal.    Metal certainly does not suck today.  Rock is not doing so well, though, I think.  "Rock and Roll is currently undergoing technical difficulties, but Bang Camaro is working to fix them as soon as possible." as I like to say.|`|zVoKLysgaa	I'd say rock but if its metal it would have to be "classic metal" for me =D|`|1vCoaf08aa	Rock    But I love Metal too.|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	I love them both VERY much.|`|AA11596133	I prefer METAL, but my husband and kids prefer ROCK, so when I am alone I crank the METAL up!!!|`|c95a1585599e1bb6a610d451c0e66d2caa	Today's music does not suck! For me personally, I would usually go with metal. There have been great releases in the genre in the past 10 years, and it seemed like last year had a huge load of amazing metal albums. Probably the best thing about metal is how many types there are, yet they're all really hard hitting. For all you nay-sayers, just try to stick with the stuff you know.|`|DrFrkM63aa	rock|`|QcJOXHdvaa	rock n roll|`|YA4qCDukaa	i prefer rock over metal.  metal just doesn't float my boat.

DUg8MRkqaa	I know bro iv been saying that forever too well i believe a hater is a term used in a condesending way to describe a person who insults something but not saying you just dont like it like if i was to say  "Yo man those cheese fries look nasty dawg!" then i would be a hater but instead i would say "man no offense but i dont think those cheese fries are gonna be good dude that is just stating your opinion     in short if you say you dont like or hate something and insult the fans of that thing you are what is known as a "hater"    If you respect there opinions then its known as being a "Different Opinion Haver "|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Spend 9 months as an R&P regular and come here at least one hour a day which will lead to several Rivals and Vendettas. Some really nasty put downs going back and forth back and forth back and forth back and forth. For 8 months see certain regulars that spend 9 months and 24/7 of that on here day after day to the point when you log on here and see them its the same as when you step into a bathroom and glance to see a toilet you just ignore it because you know IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE and to the point you no longer pay any attention to their same after same after same after same answers that are just like a broken record.    And you wont only become a hater you will want to kill people|`|wOc4Dqllaa	I was always under the impression that you have to passionately hate on something specific.

I hate most all of the music that has come out in the last ten years. It is all a variation on the same theme. I blame the musicians of my era. We had guitar gods and bands that tried hard to set their own styles. We had musicians who spent their entire lives perfecting their craft. They spoiled us with thier art. They have left us with a craving that can never be satisfied by most of todays musicians...    I hate the music companies. In my day they worked with the bands and let them grow and mature. Talent was expected and it was hard to get a contract. Now anyone can get a contract. I have never seen the number of bad bands as the current crop that is out there now.       My first 45 as a child was a beatles tune. I survived disco. I remember seeing KISS when they were young men and being blown away. I was there and involved with the punk movement when it first came out. What a wild time.  It's been since corrupted and destroyed. I was there at the beginning of the Goth movement. It went the same way. Metal went from metal to something horribly warped and twisted. I grew up in the same small town as Kurt Cobain and can say I was thrilled when grunge started. It's now gone. I cling to what few old bands are still working and hope that someday a band with actual talent will appear and sweep the current crop of losers out to sea.. Yeah, I still have a dream.. And it's made me a hater.....
mxZUt1iMaa	I love love LOVE After Dark! :3  Though I have to admit REWRITE comes in a close second.  I don't particularly like Haruka Kanata. It's okay, sure, but the opening sounds like that one commercial and I don't remember what it's for, and it REALLY bothers me. (I'm rambling now aren't I? XD)|`|EBI8aGzTaa	Yep, the ones you mentioned are also the ones I loved very much - Rewrite and After Dark. Not to say that their other songs don't measure up to those two or anything, but I remember the two songs a lot more than their other tracks because Rewrite and After Dark are OPs of my favourite animes, plus the scenes they chose to accompany the songs are eye-catching and sometimes when I listen to the two songs, images from the respective animes they represented just come up to mind XD.|`|PVK8nATSaa	i like Haruka Kanata.|`|ehF2XiMbaa	Haruka Kanata, and second Riraito (Rewrite). First jap songs that stuck to my head lol|`|3fVsb4NNaa	I have quiet a few of their songs on my mp3 player. I can't decide what i like the best...TT.TT|`|HzLvavocaa	Well......yeah I like Rewrite also, out of like 15 songs I have from them.    FullMetal Alchemist!!!!! XDD And I don't watch it either but I do plan to!!!  There's a 2nd season coming out also!!!!|`|445724d0f53c59057d2b2139781c1204aa	Wow,i didn't know Asian Kung Fu Generation was part of a FullMetal Alchemist ending. I mean I heard it but I never knew it was from that band.  Also the Naruto 2nd opening. Wow,I think these people will know be my favorite J-Rock band.  The only song I knew and heard of them was the song "After Dark",from the Bleach opening.
HRQjffv8aa	Buy    lol i hate that song >..>" anyways sorry to those who luv it    the first op. theme was the besttt|`|o5w5aYJNaa	Sell.     I actually love this song. I know alot of people don't like it,because the song contrasted so much with the first opening and the "tone" of Death Note (dark and somber),and the song was just so loud and...insane. I mean,the lyrics...   I think they were trying to go for something different, and could have possibly represented Light's insanity. Either that,or the staff at Madhouse thought that at that point they could get away with anything because it was so popular. Anyways,that's just my opinion...being a hardcore fan of Death Note,I'd have to say that the first opening suited the show a lot better,but the second opening certainly was something ^.^|`|ehF2XiMbaa	Buy...I liked it but then the anime freaks at my school wouldnt stop or give that sing a break so i kinda bleh it now. lol I think it was trying to show the insane part of death note. Lights crazyness :o|`|tTPjl2s4aa	it's okay,  but i would say neither      it is kind of a stupid song though... lol  but Death Note is amazing ;D|`|YLfwwlwjaa	I have to say sell.  The point of using Maximum the Hormones song "Whats up People" was mainly for the opening animations itself. The song fit well with how they did the opening and fit the overall theme and adrenaline the show was trying to give off.  Without action Deathnote was A highly paced adrenaline rush in almost every episode and the song gave exactly that.  As well as their song at the end Zetsobou Billy.  An amazing group and I've listend to them for quite awhile now.    Now if you wanna hear a song that doesn't really fit with the show, Listen to the Opening Japanese rap in Ayakashi Japanese Horror movies.|`|fwBIXZxPaa	Buy.    I liked the first theme best! =D|`|pTERJdzQaa	I choose Buy    "Whats up People" by Maximum the Hormone is kind of overrated because its mostly just screaming, Maximum the Hormone, they are a screamo band, but they try to hard with alot of thier songs.    Alot of people think that "Whats up People" was the best death note opening theme, but I think that Nightmare(the guys that made the music for season 1 of death Note) are a better band.    My personal favorite death note song is "Alumina" by Nightmare(ending 1 of Death Note), that song is the s***, that song is stuck in my head alot recently, seriously listen to it if you havent already, also the music video or the original song(not the death note one) is really good to.  I would say that "Alumina" is the best Death Note song.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I buy    I don't think its overrated unless you hear the song a million times.    I haven't listen to the song for awhile. So, yeah...|`|btFSgJmlaa	Buy|`|Hiasgb75aa	Buy. I dislike Metal, but what makes it worse is that its not good Metal AND it doesn't fit with the anime. Its only because its Death Note which is the main reason why people say its good. Its too Hardcore, the first opening was perfect
Bgqi0pOuaa	It might be a liitle slow for you, considering what was cutting edge stuff back then is pretty conservative by today's standards.    The book is much better and doesn't hide some of the more controversial parts.    It's basically about a woman who is a free spirit, is considered attractive to many, but won't play by the rules of society and settle down to be a traditional woman/wife, etc.|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054698/|`|jz07LXRTaa	breakfast at tiffanys and then they have sex.... its about sex    well the song i didnt know threre was a ******* movie! haha|`|FdUKvE6xaa	It's mainly a love story, but there's a sort of psychological element to it too. I can't say whether you'll like it or not since I don't know what you're into, but it's a great classic movie. Even if you don't wind up loving it, you should at least see it once. :)

Among those you have, though, I'd be torn between The Verve and Suede. Suede had a better career overall, but the Verve have had higher highs and lower lows.     And then there are the Jesus and Mary Chain, which beat everyone on the list hands down. But they weren't strictly a 90s band.|`|HEk3kBZ4aa	radiohead, muse, placebo|`|X0G16nPwaa	Blur PWND them all

ETFaQiTzaa	"The Shining," of course.  It's the best horror movie I've ever seen.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Carrie.|`|YbmklSzGaa	Carrie or Dreamcatcher.    Shawshank Redemption and Pet Semetary were good films too.|`|lFxlYx9zaa	The Stand and The Tommynockers|`|7l5V6CsGaa	Stand by Me|`|iqb1R6U0aa	i thought the mist was good|`|TOx4ahhdaa	SK does not translate well to film.  Though not my favorite book, I think Carrie stuck to the story better than most.    Redemption was a fine movie, but I don't think they captured the real spirit of Andy Dufresne with the choice of Tim Robbins as the actor.  Tim Robbins did a good job, but he was not the image or feeling I got from reading the book.|`|f5NFa55Laa	Who said that Mr. King does not translate well? That is not the writers fault, that is the directors fault.  I would suggest that you re-watch The Green Mile or the T.V. mini series The Stand.  Carrie is good, Christine is also good and has not been mentioned.  Stop blaming the writer and put the blame at the feet of the people that deserve it, the director.|`|W7pnsw0maa	I am a Stephen King fan, both books and movies.

Uky1GMVRaa	I was so disgusted by him!  He claimed that he was so healthy and smart. I thought he looked like a wrinkled up weakling and he obviously wasn't smart enough to hide what an evil person he truly is!  I could not even imagine being in the same room as this monster.  To be married to such a tragic excuse for a human being must be absolute torture!  I felt nauseous while he abused his new wife.  Intelligence and a good diet certainly don't make up for all that he lacks.  He was cruel, humorless and condescending.  He completely lacked humility, kindness, and compassion.  He is a very small, evil man.|`|EtfCJMknaa	Stephen Fowler  Please contact and voice your "over opinion" as he so delicately put it.

Where the heck did he go to school anyway where he was taught that basically every single person in the heart of the United States are just plain idiots. Does he not know that there are schools and colleges here too?  I am flabbergasted at him for the most part, but also with his wife. She knew perfectly well how he behaved, whether she saw it or not. He told her straight out "You're not going to be happy with me." Yet she sits there and doesn't say a word. This is very interesting to me considering she was against the term "skirt work", (which I also find appalling). Anyway, she is letting her husband play the alpha male by allowing him to speak and act the way he did without showing any digust. I don't pity her at all. As far as I'm concerned, she is just as bad as he is. It makes me sick. Those poor children are going to grow up with the mentality that their parents have, and that is just all kinds of sad. Imagine what they are going to go through in the near future, with how many people watched last nights episode. There are some cruel people out there, and I am sure that those kids are going to be subjected to the onslaught of anger headed that familys way. The sad part in this is that he is never going to change his attitude, and she thinks this was all 'good for a laugh.' Disgraceful. Pathetic. Shame on ABC. Shame on the Fowlers. I am just going to end this with an I am proud not only to be an American, but also to be one of those so called uneducated Midwesterners. May America and God have pity on that man's soul.|`|8tqQXcp4aa	I just posted a question like this too, like 3 hours ahead LOL.  He's such a stupid ***. No one who's well educated would embarrass their family members ESPECIALLY themselves. To me he's got the IQ of an organic pecan. Fowler will suffer. He will be on the news ALL OVER. Just watch, he will be interviewed and such getting such bad hate mail. His wife is as downright stupid too. Yeah she did help the Longs. But she was so smug after the two weeks leave. Both adults OR children the way they are acting should smarten up and should get hit by some paint balls.    OH AND, on http://realityrollcall.com/index.php/200...    someone left the fowler's home address.|`|FAaePWPWaa	That's funny I just asked that question LOL. But I'll answer anyway:)    I just felt like literally throwing something at the T.V. I applaud the husband of the wife from the Midwest for keeping his composite. It just shows who the smarter man in that table meeting. Throughout the whole show is the British guy was acting like the biggest little kid ever. He was so freakin ignorant towards American culture.    I Hated when he made up that stupid statistic. "oh 90% of Americans don't have a passport" What the hell? Well I'm sorry if people aren't thinking of jet setting the world on the economic crisis that we're in.     He was a total idiot.|`|iaLVRwBnaa	i haven't seen the end yet because i'm on the west coast, but this guy is just absolutely disgusting. how dare you move to this country and then act like you're better than everyone else... and to do so in such a childish and immature way... how embarassing for him and his family.     i've been thinking the whole time, how does he treat his wife? i mean what did their friends think when watching this? i would be embarassed to be friends with someone like that. if i were his wife i'd be completely mortified... because i mean, she seemed semi-normal or at least definately not at his level. i was wondering how she could be married to him and how she would defend the way her husband treats another adult woman in the awy that he did.|`|0tezQMsbaa	The wife, Renee Adena Stephens, has a website:  http://personallifemedia.com/hosts/208-r...  From her home page:  "Rene is an inspiring motivational speaker, seminar leader, and coach whose focus is on creating positive and lasting change, from the boardroom to the beach. She can be contacted at renee@personallifemedia.com or at 206-350-5333."    Maybe Renee should focus on "creating positive and lasting change" in her own life by dumping that pompous *** of a husband and sending him back to the U.K.!

3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	wow, that was pretty HEAVY! especially when the main riff kicks in at the start... cool!|`|7lDSkGLTaa	SWEEET|`|rytSFBbgaa	Good Song and Album as well|`|1ViGcF3xaa	Another great song!|`|srtoPxN2aa	Loved this one too GreenEyes...great rhythm, and the lead guitar really smoked!    I'll paste this except from my previous answer to your 'Whitesnke' question...Lol:    I saw Whitesnake in 1979, and again in '83 just after 'Saints & Sinners' was released. Cozy Powell was playing drums at the time, and for me that was the highlight of the whole set!  I've heard a few songs from the new album (thanks to you), and I must say I'm impressed. I feel this is by far their best work in years...so I did a little research to find out who was in the current Whitesnake lineup. I really dig the two guitarists Doug Aldrich, and Reb Beach. Though when I first heard this song I kept thinking to myself, "man, this guitarist sounds so familiar"...and the playing reminded me somewhat of Vivian Campbell, who played with Dio, and Whitesnake back in the 80's. The reason for this similarity in guitar sound, is that Doug Aldrich also played with Dio back in around 2002/3...so of course he had to nail Vivian's sound in order to pull off such early 80's Dio classics as 'Rainbow in the Dark' and 'Stand Up and Shout' during their live sets.  Reb Beach is a great sounding guitarist too, and he can be heard on a few "Artists Tribute" type albums released over the last 8 years or so...AC/DC, Ozzy, Van Halen...to name a few. He also released a couple solo albums a few years ago, that I have yet to hear.  To me David's voice sounds much different on this album, maybe partially to do with the mix, and age? Not sure, but if I didn't know it was him singing, it might have taken me several minutes to make the connection. He's still great though!    Great stuff GreenEyes...I'll be playing more of this album...thanks for posting!

The title stands for ("Camp Kill Yourself 2000,") and ringleaders Bam Margera and Brandon DiCamillo prove there's nothing they won't do for a laugh, whether it means destroying a rental car, riding furniture tied behind moving vehicles, or performing Candid Camera-style practical jokes. For good measure, you get lots of footage of Bam and buddies doing skateboard tricks as well as their bizarre trip to Iceland (where, at one point, they heckle the house of rock star Bjork). Extra features include raunchy bits that just as easily could have been part of the main menu and a pair of thrash-metal music videos with the CKY2K sensibility. --Marshall Fine      Relic66~~?|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	CKY stands for Camp Kill Yourself.

Name the anime that you are watching right now. So far.. are you liking the storyline?  --> The animes (yes! It's plural!) that I am watching happen to be Bleach and Code Geass. Do I really need to answer the question of do I like the Bleach storyline? IT KICKS @$$! (I'm only halfway through the subs, as in Ep. 140-something, though.)    2.) Which anime character did you currently started to like?  --> Let's make this plural, too. Recently, I've started to like Ulquiorra and Grimmjow. Well, I liked Grimmjow about ten episodes ago...my love for Ulquiorra and all his kawaii-ness grew even more. (He's so kawaii! But he sure can be a jerk sometimes.)    3.) If can have any anime character's house, which character would that be?  --> Kukaku Shiba's house. Hands down, Kukaku's house. I mean, she has a giant sign in front! And a friggin' cannon! It's awesome!  You know what? Make that a tie between Kukaku's house and Zero (Code Geass)'s bus. You know, in the beginning of the first season? He has a bus, with satellite TV, a computer room, a conference room, several bunkers, an office, a living room, and a kitchen. "Holy crap," I thought when I saw it. "I want a ride like that."    ~Bleach Section! (W00t!)~    1.) Who do you think has the most awesome zanpaktou?  -->Hmm...that's a hard one...maybe Renji, his bankai is a humongous snakey-thing, that kicks total butt. Ooh, I know! Toshiro-kun's! Isn't Hyourinmaru an ice dragon that attaches to his body and makes him fly? And as long as he has a little strength and willpower, all the water in the world is his to command. It's pretty hard to beat that.    2.) Do you like the Espadas?? (i love them.. xDD)  --> Well, it depends on which one you're talking about, but collectively, they're truly awesome. As previously stated, my favorites are Ulquiorra and Grimmjow. :D    3.) Did you watched the fillers?.....(i kinda found them boring...>.>)  -->Wha, the Bount Arc? I forced myself to watch them, in case they might have been important. The only good parts were the episodes where the Modsouls got to fight, and when they explained how Kenpachi got to be a captain. But like I said, I'm only up to the 140s, so there might be other fillers I don't know about.  O.o    4.) Who's your favourite vice-captain?  -->Renji Abarai. Duh! Awesome red hair, one of the most powerful Zanpakutos, and he has sexy tattoos. REALLY sexy tattoos. Plus he's just so awesome and funny!    5.) If you went home one day and found out that Kon was in your bed sleeping...what would you do? =D  --> I'd squash him. Then I'd check for his reaction and laugh. Kon is so hilarious!    6.) Who do you think is MY favourite of favourite captain?? xDD hehe..  -->YOUR favorite? Ooooh, that's a hard one...let's see...*Jepoardy music plays*...maybe Toshiro-kun? Maybe? Well, then again, you DO have a chibi picture of Shiro-chan as your avatar--    *Toshiro Hitsugaya in the background*  DON'T CALL ME "CHAN"!!!    Oh. Sorry, Toshiro-ch...Captain Hitsugaya!       ~*Bonus Question~*  When was the last time that you had seen a clown??  --> In person? Whew...*thinks*...at least three years ago.

The story's pretty intriguing and got me piqued.    3)Dante's from Devil May Cry...no need to fuss over cleaning up the whole house XD!     Bleach Section:  1) In terms of defensive advantage, Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu is very good in confusing enemies and performing very convincing illusions that no one can escape from. But when it comes to proper dueling between one person and a whole horde of enemies, the best zanpakutos for fighting would be Byakuya's Senbonzakura and Ichigo's Zangetsu.    2) The Espadas? No, I don't like them. No, I don't even LOVE them..... I am obsessed with them to the max XD!! I love Grimmjow so much!    3) Not so. I didn't watch the Bount Arc and the Vizard Arc, but I did catch the whole episodes where it revolved around Lurichiyo Kasumiooji and the new Captain replacing Gin. That particular filler is quite out of the ordinary and very much satisfying than the other fillers.    4) None. I don't really have particular favourites among them, they're all good shinigamis, nonetheless XD.    5) THROW HIM OUT THE WINDOW XD!!!    6) Ack, pretty simple - it's Toushiro Hitsugaya XD!    Bonus A:  Yaaaay, so I'm not the only person who thinks clowns are scary XD!! Yeah, I hate clowns too - and it's been YEARS since I last saw one XP.

ythN9BQgaa	At first I would be kind of scared and pissed off, but I wouldn't want them knowing that. I'd mess with their head too - and start hissing, banging on the door, screaming, using demonic voices, speaking in another language, pray to satan, and after I'm done I would burst out on the floor screaming rolling all over the place. I like freaking people out, and playing their own game. I'm sure that'll show them whose crazier :-)    Gemini sun  Scorpio moon  Leo rising|`|ko3J5akPaa	I don't really take a dump in public I try to avoid it at all cost lol. but if i had to and that happened id  be mad and not say anything and tell the person Stop please someone is in here.|`|fvPoiaAXaa	yeah i don't take a dump in public, or anywhere besides my house. i would feel uncomfortable. first of all i would be panicking because i dont know who it is and what they want, my heart would race because im a scared person i get scared of anything lol. then i would stay quiet until they left i guess, and be a little mad. that happened to me before with my grandpa though lol, he had to pee and i was using the bathroom and he was literally going to break the door. it was funny.   cancer rising and sun  aquarius moon|`|NJ0VAzSqaa	gross, i'll probably yell at the person to shut the crap up and disappear quickly.|`|40LtlYXOaa	i wouldnt care|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	No I would not be angry.  Nor would I be scared.  I would assume they have a very good reason for doing this.  Maybe they need to evacuate the building.  Maybe there is a situation in the bathroom that needs full attention and/or cooperation.  If it was a prank, I would know.  The best thing to do is just smile, wash your hands and leave.|`|plBXp91Daa	Pissed off and ask that person if there isn't another toilet.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Scared AND pissed off. Anyone that would be knocking on the stall door of someone taking a dump is surely mentally unstable on some level. I wouldn't want to go into a smelly stall and I sure as hell wouldn't be trying to get in there so bad I would beat the door down.    Did this happen to you?    edit: Oh as a prank? LOL If you're doing that to an unsuspecting friend it would be hilarious but don't try it on a stranger. I would worry for your safety. They might come busting out of the stall bare @ss and all to get to you.|`|bFdqlM6oaa	The technical name for such a person is a 'turd burgler,' just so ya know. See def  2 below...    http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.ph...    I would definitely be pissed off and would tell the person as much in no uncertain terms.    The only thing worse is a crop duster but I'll leave it up to you to find out what that one means. ; )|`|HpWyrJKGaa	I'd be really pissed and tell them to go take a **** elsewhere GRRRR MY TOILET lol XD|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Both..     Sagittarius|`|QWfyOnRMaa	I'd be SO scared... that's just weird.|`|TfAxeV3Maa	haha! both..more mad than scared tho  sagittarius sun|`|738e2bd340747ab38ce7182b67f01999aa	I would be both. It is bad enough I dislike talking to people in the stall next to me when I am going to the bathroom lol. I would be angry at the person banging the door because they know that I am in there! I would also be scared because I would not know what that person wanted in the first place. I might even be paranoid enough to think that they wanted to do some kind of physical harm to me haha;if they wanted to, I would fight back.    Virgo Sun  Taurus Moon  Scorpio Rising|`|1HSMf6dbaa	uhhh, both i guess. it'd be kinda embarrassing which would make it both.|`|fXUlPjSIaa	I think at first I would be a little scared, then I would probably start laughing.

wOc4Dqllaa	I actually sort of liked that cover. It wasn't good by any means, but it was a fun, amateurish punk take on the song.     Limp Bizkit covering The Who, on the other hand...

AA10065759	There are ONLY THREE ways to get a backstage pass....    1) You must know someone connected with the tour, more  like a relative that works for the concert. Or, if you are lucky have  a friend in school that has a relative that works for the concert.    2) Be a news reporter. You would have to be one connected  to your local newspaper or local news TV team.    3) A local radio station will sometime have a backstage pass  of the concert and offer it as a promotional prize.  Either you have to be the 7th or 10th caller.  Or answer the right question on the air.  Or hope that the entry form you filled out gets picked out  in a drawing.    Those are the ONLY WAY you will get a backstage pass.    - - - - - - - - - - - - -

However, Ham, Evans and Gibbins are now dead--Ham and Evans took their own lives but, within the last few years, Gibbins died at the age of about 50 or so.    Then, there are two guitarists that are next to being forgotten about completely:  Jerry Reed ("The Guitar Man," as he was often called by fans) and Danny Gatton.  Both were great and Jerry Reed was alive until September 1st or 2nd of last year, but Danny Gatton took his own life back in '94, I believe it was.

9z5NASypaa	Be very romantic, have lots of money and be very good looking. Me being a libra am very very fussy with looks. Though in saying you have to be somewhat good looking, you cant be in love with yourself either. You have to have some confidence but shy at the same time.  oh and Libras are very flirty people, so do a bit of that. we love it.|`|fXUlPjSIaa	Compliment him/her. I am an Aquarius and my lover of 2 years is a Libra. My guy is so dependent on my , not really approval, but "admiration" of him. Libra's need that in their relationship, whether it be romantic or not. I think above all is just be their friend and never betray their trust, they never forgive you after that.|`|y6wikiJDaa	That's easy.

If you are in love with a Libran man or woman, give him or her your attention and your company. This is one individual who truly wants to share as much as possible in life and will be a faithful and dedicated partner if given the chance. You may notice, too, that he(she) always strives to be inclusive of not only you, but friends and acquaintances as well. This person truly needs interactions with others and desires a full social life above many other things.    Because of his(her) desire for balance, you may also see some striking dualities here. Soft lights and classical music could be interspersed with wild dancing revelries to rock and roll; each Libra expresses this aspect in his or her own way. Whatever the oppositions at work here, they will play and interplay in equal amounts. If you are not as comfortable with one side, just wait a bit until the other reappears.    A touch of class and refinement works best here, too. This is one individual who is singularly unimpressed with the grubby or ordinary. Fine china and linen are generally preferred on the table as are brand names in the clothing. Also, if you seek to impress this person by sending flowers, exotic lilies and tropical orchids work much better than a regular bunch of carnations. Think elegant here.    A Libran is also very concerned with appearance and wants you to be proud of him(her). With excellent taste and a superb sense of color, he(she) should be allowed to pick out the shades and hues for the home and office. This individual will often throw together some dramatic tints that you may not appreciate until you actually see.    You can be sure, however, that this honey will never leave you lonely. He(she) understands togetherness unlike most other signs and you would do well to return the favor. Be careful, too, not to accept too many gratuities without exchange as he(she) will be aware of the imbalance and may harbor silent resentments in the future. Enjoying the fun, sharing, and caring of this individual while giving back the same will ensure a long, happy, and prosperous relationship for both of you.|`|UQT37xS1aa	Honestly, it doesn't matter about the stuff. I mean, you could be a Cancer, and it wouldn't matter. Chances are, she'd never really know, and if she did, she wouldn't care.    So just get to know her, and all that. Do what'd you do for any girl you like. It doesn't matter about that, really.

565df5fe4c276dc3f59d54d1b9259380aa	Horror movies are meant to scare you. Thriller may or may not scare you, but it gives you an adrenaline rush that makes you "feel" scared.    i.e.) Speed (with Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves) is a thriller; it is about a bus that explodes if it goes below 55 mph. It keeps you on the edge of your seat to see what will happen.     Horror movies give element of suprise and fear. That is what Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm street are designed to do. You know someobody is going to get killed; there is no doubt of that. You may even be familiar with what is going to happen in the movie. Butit scares you because it is abnormal.|`|c3Kay8Z3aa	I think thrillers are like dark and fast pasted mystery type that may involve killing, whereas horror movies are like blood guts, murder, jump out of your seat kind action...    http://home.comcast.net/~pjhinfo/site/?/...|`|B0avgIpRaa	Thrillers are characterized by fast pacing, frequent action, and resourceful heroes who must thwart the plans of more-powerful and better-equipped villains. Literary devices such as suspense, red herrings and cliffhangers are used extensively.    Horror films are movies that strive to elicit responses of fear, horror and terror from viewers. Their plots frequently involve themes of the supernatural. Horror movies also usually include a central villain|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	horror movie are movies like nightmare on elm street, friday the 13th etc. and thriller movies are the blair which project I guess|`|jGbkpaKbaa	thriller: gives you thrills and excites  horror: horrifies you, often disgusting and grotesque|`|74vZPd7qaa	a thriller movie slowly builds up the suspense to a given situation. in the shining the build up was in the character that jack nicholson played, where you see very subtly the character changing, till  he was the full blown "johnny", whereas in a horror movie  the suspense is built up but the contents of the movie is usually very gruesome, bloody, and just horrible, thats how i see it anyway.

He was scarred as an 8-year-old by the murder of his parents in front of him and developed a hatred for criminals that preyed on innocents.  He saw how criminals were taking over the Gotham that his father helped to build and wanted to do something about it.  He was afraid of bats as a child and chose the bat as the symbol he would use to put fear in the hearts of the criminals he would now fight.    His comic book origin was in "Detective Comics" and he was known as the "World's Greatest Detective" and a master of disguise, hand-to-hand combat, etc.  His intellect and guile is what set him apart as a "superhero".|`|tYiMSItraa	That and he's The Worlds Greatest Detective.

TWILIGHT RULES! :D|`|ZT755XSxaa	E D W A R D, poor Jacob, at least he has Reneesmee|`|Vz9Asegoaa	Edward Cullen all the way|`|pLD3pYsuaa	I would so date Robert Pattinson it think he's hot :)|`|dDEwO3Cwaa	edward|`|wbzChtWBaa	I'm with you on this one, Edward! =p|`|x66TTEymaa	if it was based on their character and what they look like in the movie, and how they act in the book, then def. edward( i like guys who sparkel...lol)     but if it were for how hot they were in real life, jacob (taylor lautner) would win HANDS DOWN !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)|`|vUT0WEzdaa	i would date edward without a doubt|`|ZNjoOzcdaa	I would date Edward. Every girl wants to fall in love and he's the perfect guy. All he wants to do is protect and love Bella. It's so romantic. He doesn't care what her flaws are at all. Every time I read the books I just can't put it down because every little thing Bella is and Bella does reminds me of me. I can't help falling in love with a fictional character.|`|HYzfm2tIaa	edward! i love the twilight series
QeTDv4RAaa	Ahah... Well, if you video record yourself imitating it, then using a visual-enhancing or some kind of effect adding software, then yes.    Otherwise, you can try getting ready to for a energy blast like "Kamehameha" and then at "HAA" you can put mentos in and yea, blast off =D|`|2ogFk4Amaa	NO it is not possible.|`|a6fb6708bba705283e524493764398c5aa	With your body? No. With a machine? Quite possible. A taser, for example, uses energy to create a shock. It's not a blast, but the concept is similar. Depending on what you define an energy blast as, one could make the argument that certain bombs would fit the profile.
Z7c5d0nuaa	Well, Layne.    Only because Kurt wanted to die and there was no stopping him.  He was a sad person.    Layne, well, he overdosed. Big Whoop.  Big Accident. Bring him back.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Layne Staley.|`|L4f5ONEkaa	how about none  and kurt cobain wanted  to die so lets let him stay in the ground  if we had to pick one it would be layne|`|zZPbmxWkaa	I honesty thing that Layne would be better now than Kurt would be.|`|MYsSyfQzaa	Both dude, so we can have both great Grunge bands back.|`|pVTevFJgaa	It's hard...  But I'd say Layne, because Alice In Chains were an awesome band.    Nirvana was awesome too, but I begin to prefer AIC.|`|qCd4T4o5aa	I don't consider them Gods just human,   Kurt Cobain....|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I prefer Kurt Cobain    I think I'd bring back Layne though. Kurt was obviously in a lot of emotional pain for him to kill himself and he's at peace now, I wouldn't want to bring him back to that pain.|`|9hFexadLaa	Kurt|`|7qt4aQGYaa	If you brough either of them back, they wouldn't have a soul, so any music they made would suck|`|dKLzxoUPaa	Kurt |`|DlAbPCtpaa	Layne Staley with out a doubt, Alice In Chains rocked !!!!!|`|vByDs2Q9aa	Layne Staley he definetely has a better voice and band, kurt cobain and nirvana was not too special to me|`|DUg8MRkqaa	Well actually i choose Layne because Cobain must have been going through some rough sh*t to kill himself i mean come on hes the Nirvana Singer for Christ sake!! man but if he had it that bad i think we should at least let Layne get another junkie binge in for old times sake|`|uHmLkqmRaa	Definitely Kurt.|`|LJJ38fVKaa	I love both, they were soo cool in their very unique way...  BUT If I had to choose I'd say KURT just cause HE was SO DAMN HOT! LOL|`|Ot06v8yvaa	KURT COBAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    There is no competition|`|viqGambsaa	I like Kurt better, but then the emo fan-girls would go crazy.   (Damn I hate it when the emo's like the same music as me)   Also, Kurt seemed more tortured, but I haven't read Layne's biography yet. I would bring back Layne, but I guess William DuVall would have to leave Alice In Chains, but I like him...hmmm, That is a great question|`|xN6ZjzJOaa	Kurt, mainly because he didn't kill himself, so he shouldn't've wanted to be dead in the first place. But also because he would've ended up being one of those great old musicians that plays acoustically (realized that after watching Nirvana Unplugged) like Bob Dylan.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	Kurt. I love Layne and Alice In Chains, but Nirvana really was more creative and influential. And I've heard that AIC's new vocalist is absolutely phenomenal, even if he could never replace Layne.|`|lGzQtEH7aa	Kurt Cobain|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	Layne|`|1vCoaf08aa	Layne.

HmFQ5pwuaa	OK, soo this is probably the most ignorant answer You will receive for this question, but i liked the movie where the Russian Guy said.."I will kill You"   no idea which movie it was, BUT, i found it entertaining that the girlfriend of the Russian Guy was ( at that time) the current girlfriend of Mr Stallone....and all i could think was ( while watching that movie) was the line from "Cobra"......."you sure put alot of ketchup on your french fries"...so frankly. I have no well resourced answer, just:    The one where Rocky  was challenged by the "Russian guy"...lol|`|vKctajqiaa	well critics say that the first and rocky balboa were the best but personally I think the fourth was best with the all but the 5th in second and the 5th the worst of them all|`|Um7mYM71aa	1st|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	The first one.  .|`|a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	7|`|080iXsSfaa	rocky 4---best one ever--and i was really disappointed with the last rocky.  it was ok,, just not as great as i thought it would be.|`|7LhGfkrOaa	4!  Drago kills Creed then The Rock enters enemy territory to avenge his death.  Especially since the movies came out at the hight of the cold war.  US vs Russia and Rocky wins.  Despite how much they hated each other and the crowd hated him, even Rocky said, "If I could change.  You could change.  EVERYONE COULD CHANGE!"  The crowd saw past the flags they wore on their shorts and saw two men slugging it out and giving it their all.  The crowd didnt see an enemy American but a man fighting another man who happened to be a national hero and together they put on a show.      Plus James Brown was in the film!
022a70c3422f4e77c8a63e672f7c2b18aa	Back in the 70's there was a film called "The Big Bus", which was supposed to be a parody those action/dramas "The Poseidon Adventure" and "The Towering Inferno". A giant, impossibly long and ridiculously powered (nuclear, I think) luxury bus (with pools, dance floors, etc.) somehow goes out of control and everybody's in jeopardy and there's a bunch of B-List celebs (incl. Stockard Channing of "Grease" fame) who somehow manage to make it through.    Even then - as a young lad - I went because I HAD to see how bad it was. My love of cheese demanded it. I wasn't disappointed.        jdk|`|8TmK8Qklaa	it was so stupid I can't even bother myself to remember the title.|`|ci64gIZ8aa	THE OXFORD MURDERS!    This film sets up to sell itself as 'clever' (but you'll need a lobotomy before you can accept this ill-considered flannel). Several irrelevant 'red-herring' plots are just abandoned without explanation, the characters are inconsistent and uninteresting. The marketing tries to attract an audience from 'Morse' (TV) 'Poirot' and 'Da Vinci Code', but has NOTHING to offer that audience, except frustration.    If you ARE going to watch it, and hope to beat the 'detectives' to the solution, don't bother! It defies explanation!|`|YxUBB9Kwaa	Besides all the dumb disney ones that took like 2 weeks to put together, Cloverfield was terrible.  Hahha, don't watch it.|`|lFzXZQQDaa	Napoleon Dynamite.

vrcxxRr8aa	The newest song of hers I've heard is Mr. President, and it was all right. Aside from that, the only album I have of hers is the Misunderstood album. That music is nice to listen to every now and then. I don't know how bad or good her latest songs are, and I don't much care. There other other artists I prefer to listen to more.|`|9hFexadLaa	I liked her in the 2001-2002 era just because I was in first grade and knew nothing about music, now she's too mainstream and crap|`|9Vjjr0M7aa	well i like her song So What, and i like some of her other songs|`|zCWsONZcaa	meh I go back and forth her songs are catchy and I won't like turn her off on the radio but you won't find her on my ipod|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	i dislike her very much.    she's such a wannabe rocker, she obviously sings pop.|`|DaH0rOghaa	Dislike Im not gonna lie shes a good songwriter but  she just bugs me.     Like for when she wrote a song called Mr .

to6JW3yFaa	Well I guess it depends on the people. But Im a Pisces and I had two friends who were Taurus... and I just couldnt handle it. Im not saying your bad like them it's just they were too attention seeking, possesive in relationships, and always tried and take the lead in everything.    One of them was even so obsesed with her bf that she kept on driving to his house or work when he wouldnt pick up the phone or call here for a day. She even asked me to flirt with him in order to see how far he would take it in order to test him. And my other friend was just wayyyy too controling. I just couldnt take it. Reason we're not friend anymore.    But normally Taurus and Pisces are supposed to be ok together. It was probably just my bad personal experience with my friends.    Haha of course Pisces do have many negative traits too. Were realllly gulable and over emotional. So I try to work on those faults. But good luck!! :)|`|eFvBGBbyaa	im a pisces ;)|`|abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	Yes... definitely.
CQ2XnlAtaa	Lmfao,   none of those.  Immortal Technique dominates with  his lyrics.  He uses alot of literary devices in his music.  I'm not sure if any of those rappers use any  devices to boost their talent.  XD|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Tupac is better than any rapper today.|`|k39bNUgeaa	Eminem    he is the only good rapper    the others rappers suck|`|LRLu1ofNaa	Eminem.    He has some really good songs, he is a great rapper, and he raps about real stuff, not just sex and drugs all of the time.|`|79b8592899aa3dcb578c630cb4ebe264aa	Live -Kanya West  Dead-Tupac.(RIP)|`|AA10368887	The one with no vocal cords.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	It's definitely Nas or Common.     They are very inspirational and there lyrics have meanings. Sure Eminem is great, but he has just faded a little. Nas has been strong, while Eminem's new album might not be so good. Jay Z is okay but eh, I dont think I would put him here.     As for Lil Wayne he is not even in the best rapper category.|`|8JDxBlcVaa	i love eminem. he spits so hard. dr. dre is the best beats. jay z is pretty weak and 50 is good too. but eminem is most def the best. i like lil wayne alot too. but some of his songs are not good and weak|`|E0Ex48Owaa	Eminem.|`|wpoJvW3Yaa	either:  Lil Wayne  or  T.I.  cuz they sikk|`|By2ZR1lfaa	gots be ackinyelly 1 only yoo upp g i kool|`|pmiKJGJmaa	LIL WAYNE!!!  he is definitely the best rapper alive... but tupac lays it down! his lyrics are still hot even though he's not alive!|`|108e74378ce116f1a1ab7712a41679a6aa	I would have to say Eminem because he's a white rapper who is actually pretty good (a feat in and of itself) and his songs are usually more than "Girl, I want you in my pants." Most of his songs have a lot of emotion to them. As for girl rappers, Fergie is DA BOMB! She's white and a girl, and she kicks some serious @$$!|`|9XsplTQIaa	Eminem is the best rapper alive because he is versatile. He can rap about ANYTHING whether it be the government, himself, the club, the ghetto, his friends. his enemies, ANYTHING.That's what makes him the best (and having about 58 million albums sold worldwide helps too)|`|WZeUrVXFaa	the real Slim Shady, why not?|`|b7dabce9f42d6342d691be11ac8a8437aa	HOVA!

They have fine-tuned flows and their content is thought-provoking and worthwhile.|`|IqqciSgcaa	Its either eminem or Kevin Rudolf.

Okay... well who is like tupac but alive?........... its T. I.!!! He is the best. Not only is he rapping about his life, but its true, and hes dealing with going to jail for up to 30 YEARS. But the next best is 50.|`|6lomrGpNaa	Eminem. You know the worlds ****** up when the best rapper is white and the best golfer is black.|`|wlkp7ac7aa	Look all the prejudice white people. "eminem" this and "eminem" that. I say it is impossible to determine who the best rapper is. All rappers, like most musicians, all have different styles and flow.|`|AA12021779	Jay-Z. Because he's a lyrical assassin. His lyrics are tight.(Kanye West also).|`|l06FQn4laa	Hmm... TI or Eminem... I can't decide which...

zE0tGIJTaa	Okay, so here's what happened. Rachel Summers killed Anna's mom, but they called to the nurse place and they had no records of a Rachel Summer's. So then she thought that she was Mildred Kemp because of the beads, which Rachel took care of the kids and that's when Mildred gave them to her. Mildred was the person in the mental hospital rooming with Anna, and she didn't know that. Her sister was really dead becuase she killed her by leaving the gas thing running and knocking the candle off of the table, and Rachel really changed her name becuase of a crazy boyfriend. Matt was coming to meet her but he died becuase Rachel didn't want him telling her that she killed the mom, so she made a scheme and killed her. Rachel was going to kill Anna because she knew the secret, but really "Alex" killed Rachel then Alex was really dead, and it turns out Anna killed her. Anna goes to the mental place again, and the creepy room-mate girl says, welcome home, holding the pearls, and closes the door, it says Mildred Kemp.|`|1HSMf6dbaa	idk. i think i would have 2 see the movie first. i'm guessing i probably should've read what u said in the title, cause now i kno wat happens. srry, this was the most unhelpful answer ever!!!!!|`|ea0b5BzBaa	Basically, Mildred Kemp and Rachel both had pearl necklaces but Mildred's was the one that she took from that dead woman and Rachel just happened to have one (because an old patient gave it to her?)|`|ANg8RFWUaa	Okay Anna got all the things messed up.   Well the crazy girl was the nannie who killed all the kids and whatever thats why she is in the rehab place. The reason why Anna got her messed up with Rachel is because the crazy girl always tells her "stories" (remmeber in the begginging she said dont go who am I going to tell stories to? ) well the crazy girl told Anna stories of her having an Affair and about the pearls etc. So Anna was thinking of that when she went back home, and since Rachel is like a nannie she got messed up with Rachel and Mildred Kemp .But I really dont get about the kids and her mom always coming up ...|`|8d3618c938ad29b921ec468f5579f015aa	Well, I haven't seen the movie but I have seen what it was remade from, A Tale of Two Sisters, screwed up movie. Anyway so I can guess. I really wanna see it. So because Anna accidently killed her mom and Alex, she was sent to the mental place where the lady who says "Who Am I gonna tell the stories to now?", she was Mildred Kemp. She killed the children the entire time and the Stepmother was the nurse and the crazy nanny was putting these stories in Anna's head while it was weak. So read the Wikipedia page about it.|`|p7NLUiJnaa	basically, bringing anna to the institution only made her condition worse.  Her mental roomie turned out to be mildred kemp, who had been telling anna her story of murdering the mother and three kids and having an affair with the dad.  Since bringing anna to the institution made her worse, she incorporated all the ideas in her head and to kill rachel summers.  If you've noticed, throughout the whole movie she's been hallucinating and made scenarios up in her head.  And she probably developed a dual personality; alex being her "other side".  And rachel and mildred coincidentically had the same necklace, furthering anna's "mental side" to believe that rachel summers changed her name from mildred kemp, which, in truth, is that rachel changed her name because of an abusive boyfriend.  Stupid anna's dad!  If he hadn't been unfaithful, none of that woulda happened!!|`|7AyUXvpyaa	Well it seems like you got most of the story right. Anna just got the idea of using Mildred Kemp's name to try to frame Rachel. Anna was just trying to finish what she started, like she said to the doctor in the end. I mean, this is just my interpretation of it. It's kind of ambiguous, so it's open to all interpretations. It's left to your imagination.|`|bd5ead445df134b473aeacfeb17c427faa	i didnt understand it too at first but like i think at the beginning when anna leaves, mildred says "who will i tell my stories to?" and i think that anna thought that the storie was real also she didnt like her dads girkfriend so she just pretended that it was mildred ad thought that her dad would believe her or she was just crazy... but the girl was mildred kemp and thats why she was holding the pearls that were the real pearls from  the woman she killed|`|oACcUioXaa	Okay,   It was a coinsidence that they both had the same pearls..  The two brothers and the sister that was killed, was killed by Mildred Kemp, Who was the crazy girl from the Instition..   The pearls that Mildred Kemp had were stolen after she killed the children...  I hope that helped somewhat LOL  :)|`|6f5aa9c4e207290404bf3f12430afc6aaa	first of all, lola was totally wrong, and i saw the movie, understood it and liked it|`|6fgpJINxaa	well you know how mildred says in the beginning 'who will i tell my stories to'? well she probably told anna that story and for some crazy reason, anna got it in her head that mildred was her stepmom.....well the main think is that anna was insane so when rachel said things like 'i've always wanted to have a daughter..and now you've taken that away from me' anna was only imagining it....also the pearls were also something she imagined.|`|lYUCqNwVaa	This is what happened before the fire, Anna was kissing her boyfriend but then she left cause he wanted sex. She goes to her house and looks through the key hole and sees her dad making love to the nurse. This makes her so angry that she wants to burn her house down. She fills the water can with oil but forgets the close the valve complete causing the oil to continue leaking. When Alex closes the door, the lantern falls causing the small house to explode killing her mom and sister. This caused her to cut herself and not accept what happened. They send her to a hospital for help and she meets another girl, Mildred Kelp, who tells Anna all her stories. On the day of Anna's release, her doctor tells her to go finish what she started and Mildred tells her she will be back, this foreshadows the future. When she gets home she blocks the facts of what happened the night of the fire and lives her own imagination. She still believes that her sister is alive. Her dad's girl friend all was trying was to be a good mother, but Anna did not see that. The reason she changed her name was to get rid from her past life, she was innocent. Anna believed that she was Mildred Kelp because of the necklace, needles and the way she acted. She had needles because she was a nurse and the necklace was just a coincident. At the end the fathers girlfriend tells her that all she wanted was to be a good mother and she took that away from her, which foreshadows her death. At the end Anna kills her. Also she kills her boyfriend by pushing him off a cliff because he says he saw what she did but she was outraged. At the end she finishes what she started (which is uncertain) and returns to the hospital

cIqpL3tGaa	I didnt see the movie, and I guess no one else but you did.
XF1ctbrkaa	yeah, as the other answer said..  The guy did die.. (now, why he was going to tell her that she was the one that caused the fire.. I am not sure.. I wouldn't tell a mentally unstable person I watched them do it..just my two cents)     She was sedated..   Rachel did not exactly attack her.. she got strict.. and gave meds.       I know what went on mainly because I love the original..  and although some of the story was changed, the "twist" was pretty much the same.. (although in the original the step mother was also in her mind)  SPOILERS BELOW:      So, here's what happened:   She walked in and saw her father sleeping with the nurse.. this made her mad, so she ran to the generator, poured gas into a water can and was going to burn the house down (kill her father and the nurse), but her sister argued with her, and she didn't turn the nozzle off all the way..  her sister went in to help the mother and knocked a lantern over..  as Anna was walking towards the house the boat house exploded killing her mother and sister..   she mentally unhinged at this point..   Most of it was just a story she told herself.. (the stuff about the women killing the kids was based on the stories she had been told by the real Mildred.. whatever her last name was.. that was the girl from the beginning who said "who will I tell my stories to?"  ..  this is why the cop says it's been only a couple of years, but her memory has it  as being a decade ago)  Some part of her did it on purpose though.. her therapist said to "finish it".. and that's exactly what she did.. she was on her way to kill Rebecca when the explosion stopped her.. she finished it.. ..|`|7LJ2Tx2Yaa	First the things I can answer:    The guy did die.  In the end flash montage, they show her pushing him into the water.      My guess is that Rachel was not that much of a jerk.  I think we where just seeing everything how the main chick perceived everything.  I would say that Rachel did sedate her, because she was really a nurse.  Maybe the main girl was used to sedation, because of the mental ward, and it did not effect her much.    But the end was Fight Club.  We see everything through her eyes until the end.  She sees herself as a victim, an innocent person, who is seeing visions of reality.  These visions are the people she has killed are warning her about what she is doing.      That last part was my opinion.  I could expand more, but I am not sure how solid it will come out on text.  I like talking this stuff out.    Hope this helps|`|vmbq8s6Oaa	rachel did not really attack her. the guy DID really die, but she pushed him off a cliff. she thought she was waiting with her sister. but really, she subconsiously pushed him off a cliff.   heres an overview: she gets out of the mental hospital & thinks dads new gf killed her mom. when REALLY the girl was going to kill her dad & rachel, when she accidentally killed her mom & alex. but in her mind, she made it seem like rachel did it & that her sister was still alive, when really, her sister died the night of the fire. if you look back at the movie, you realize no one actually talked to alex, so it was all in her imagination. and she made her self believe that rachel was really 19 year old margret kemp, when really, it was just a story she made in her mind. margaret kemp was only the girl next to her in the mental hospital, and SHE was the one who killed the 3 kids, NOT rachel. rachel is actualy a good person, but she killed her, but she thought alex killed her. then at the end she's sent back to the mental hospital.    WOW HOPE THAT HELP!|`|LUcEF91saa	okay the person in the middle who called the girl rebecca is crazy cause thats not even her name. it was defff rachell.and father never died. but way to try and understand it.|`|S4XzQaeXaa	okay so for everyone who answered this before me THANK YOU ! finally !  i didn't understand it. cuz i saw it today and i was trying to find the summarys but yeah this helped :] so thanks.

Kswn0Aqcaa	Yes you can do it.  Some people wouldn't even see such a thing. They might notice of course and ask you to get another copy.    It's not completely right, morally or legally, but you can do it.|`|xqrwDmyUaa	If there is a sticker on the movie that say 7 dollars they have to honor that price, there is a law. I used to work in retail and the manager there mislabeled something once and he was forced to sell it at that price after the customer threatened to call the cops. If they thought you were switching tags, they could review tapes and have you charged for that but if it has the wrong price tag on it and it's their fault they must give you the item at that price.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	It may be possible, if you make a big enough fuss, but you are likely going to be turned down if it is the only one that is misplaced.    You don't necessarily have an error in pricing, it's likely from a customer wanting the movie, then deciding they didn't want it- and then placed it on the closest movie shelf.|`|f5NFa55Laa	No, because the upc code is registered in the computer inventory in  the register.

Euge Groove for his version of Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On, also there is a CD out there with Smooth Jazz artists paying tribute to Luther Vandross on the Forever, For Always, For Luther CD...if all fails, just play some Luther Vandross....that would definitely set the mood!!!

C7YbYUYPaa	The album is called revelation.    The second disc has old Journey hits, sung by the new frontman Arnel Pineda.  He does them very well, you would almost swear it is Steve.    The first disc is good in my opinion.  A song you may have heard is Never Walk Away.  It has made the rounds on some radio stations, and has a real Journey feel.  A couple others I like off of the first disc are Sunshower, Change For The Better, and After All These Years.    For sure worth buying, if nothing else for the classics being reborn with a new voice.

WpqwaqcQaa	Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (1997) {Wild at Heart ( 4.6)}        Buffy: I've never seen her like this before, Giles. It's like it hurts too much to even form words.      "Captain Planet and the Planeteers" (1990) {The Ultimate Pollution ( 1.20)}        Ma-Ti: [places his hand over the Planet Vision upon seeing the villagers cowering as weapons are being bought] I cannot look at this! It hurts too much to see such suffering!      "Gata salvaje" (2002)        Rosaura Ros: Yes, but I don't want to see him, it hurts me too much.      "Gilmore Girls" (2000) {The Long Morrow ( 7.1)}        Lorelai: [Explaining to Sookie why she had broken up with Luke for good] It was him not fighting for me. I gave him the ultimatum and he let me walk away. I didn't want a life separate from Luke, and that's all he could give me. It's like Luke is driving a car and I just want to be in the passenger seat. He's locked the door and I have to hold onto the bumper. I am not even asking him to open the door for me, just leave it unlocked and say come in, but he didn't do that. So I am hanging on to the bumper and life goes on and the car goes on, and I get really badly bruised and I'm hitting potholes. And it hurts. It really hurts. So yesterday I had to let go of the bumper. Because it hurts too much.      "Lucy Show, The" (1962) {Lucy Meets the Berles ( 6.1)}        Milton Berle: That's what hurts. You love me too much to say it.      "Perfect Strangers" (1986) {Falling in Love Is... ( 2.7)}        Balki Bartokomous: No I won't! I don't want to, it hurts too much!      "South of Nowhere" (2005) {Can't Buy Me Love ( 3.2)}        Spencer Carlin: And I don't know if you'll ever know. And it's too confusing... and... and complicated... and... and it hurts way too much.      "South of Nowhere" (2005) {The Valley of the Shadows ( 3.1)}        Spencer Carlin: And I don't know if you'll ever know. And it's confusing... it's complicated... and it hurts way too much.      "South of Nowhere" (2005) {The Valley of the Shadows ( 3.1)}        Spencer Carlin: And I don't know if you'll ever know. And it's too confusing and complicated and it hurts way too much.      "South of Nowhere" (2005) {What Just Happened? ( 1.10)}        Ashley Davies: [sarcastically] Cute. Do you want that life? Stupid little comments about what you are and how you feel? So I learned to laugh most things off, because it hurts too much to do anything else.      Con Air (1997)        Garland Greene: He's a font of misplaced rage. Name your clich; Mother held him too much or not enough, last picked at kickball, late night sneaky uncle, whatever. Now he's so angry moments of levity actually cause him pain; gives him headaches. Happiness, for that gentleman, hurts.      Freddy Got Fingered (2001)        Jim: Boo-hoo. Little Lord Fauntleroy's tummy hurts because there's too much roast beef in it.      Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (2001)        Goli: Will our dream ever come true? No, Bhuvan. It hurts too much to dream like that.      Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The (2003)        Frodo: [voiceover] And thus it was. A fourth age of middle-earth began. And the fellowship of the ring... though eternally bound by friendship and love... was ended. Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey... we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. We were home. How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on... when in your heart you begin to understand... there is no going back? There are somethings that time cannot mend... some hurts that go too deep... that have taken hold. Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end... that each of us must come and go in the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him... save one. My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part in the story will go on.      Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, The (2005)        Bridget: I can't. It hurts too much.

lipnPjGxaa	Yeah its something like.. The first time most teens have the sex talk with their parents is when they're telling them they're pregnant. Parents, if you're teens have a question about sex, don;t assume they're doing it. Teens, if you're parents don't talk to you about sex don't assume they don't care. Start talking. For more information go to www.stayteen.org (dont know if thats right..but its something like that) or abcfamily.com. Something along those lines :)|`|JtcWfQ1uaa	she says that the 1st time too many teens talk about sex is when their pregnant or something along those lines.

hJP9y6kjaa	You've got to use a lot of hand control to keep the strums short and percussive, and know how to properly mute the strings.    For the right hand, that's a combination of palm-muting while playing and using your right hand to dampen and mute the strings. You can do this by using the palm-muting technique, just a little bit further up the string. It's important to not palm-mute too aggressively, there's not much distance between getting some chunk and thunking out a dead note.    The left hand is going to have to work hard, as it will do the bulk of the fretting and muting. There are different ways to do a percussive mute (ie, strumming while your fingers are held across the strings), one of which results in a "chucka" sound, and one of which results in a deeper "shunka" sound. The first method involves holding your hand lightly across multiple strings, holding multiple fingers on the strings. You should get a "chucka" sound as you strum them, short and thin. You should get no harmonics, unless you want them to sound out of course. If you can't avoid the harmonics, you may have your gain up too high!    The second type of percussive mute is when you hit an open string (usually one of the bottom ones) but place your fingers near the nut, lightly muting the strings... kind of like a palm-mute, but on the other end of the neck. You should get a very deep sound, more like a "shunk" sound than the thinner sound you got earlier.    Anyways, it's all about controlling your volume. Strum only as hard as you need to, don't let the notes ring out any longer than they have to, and be careful not to hit the wrong strings.    Metal is all about rhythm. You must have a precise right hand - and that means lots of practice! Playing to a metronome is almost prerequisite for precise riffage, and it's important to practice your scales and riffs with either a clean tone or with light distortion - gain can obscure the sound of imprecise picking and strumming and poor technique in general. Picking should be clean, with no fret buzz or sloppy strumming.    Check out Death - Chuck Schuldiner is a classic example of a highly technical yet aggressive guitarist. I haven't heard ADTR before, so I just youtubed them... not bad, but try checking out Death... ADTR ain't bad, but they aren't exactly complex in terms of their riffage. Umm, link below. This was one of the bands that started it all back in the 80's!        Saul|`|L4f5ONEkaa	a day to remember isnt really metal just to let you know their older stuff was but not so much their new stuff, homesick is pretty sick so far though i like the downfall of us all    edit with help    try drop d tuning or drop c tuning  it has to do with how easy you can move  around the frets and also how your guitar is tuned  i wish i could explain better but as the other dude  said its hard explaining over the internet  you want to turn your lowest string to a c  but also drop down your other notes one  if you like the sound go with it  also have your treble high and mids low  on the amps    also check out palm muting my friend taught me how  to do it i dont really prefer to do it but its a sick sound  search it up but ill give you a quick definition of it  you have to place the bigger part of your hand  close to the guitar bridge and place it on the strings  then pluck the lowest sting to get the sound while  still holding on, and to get even more of a better sound  choose the next neck pickup( you need a bridge pickup on your guitar) i advise you to get one.    also invest in getting a new pedal like a me-50  it goes cheap it doesnt matter if you get a new one  or a used one, used ones are just as fine and have  it at 8 if you get it or just change around the settings  to the sound you want and have the bottom atleast  a 7, sorry if im talking confusing lol        i play guitar and keyboard/synth in a band  ive been play guitar for about 7 years  which makes me 8 when i started    you have to really study to get the right sound  sometimes i just listen to the instrumentals  of some songs to get me the basic idea of  what notes or chords i should play on my guitar    a breakdown completely changes the melody  and its just like a bridge    also breakdowns have usually already been played  in the song its just that now in the breakdown they're  played faster or slower just to let you know    how much pressure you apply on the bridge  matters a lot dont put to much pressure on it  but you want enough to mute it to get the bass  type of sound    listen to the acacia strain they=amazing  one of their good songs is JFC|`|8jSsGfUXaa	Have you tried taking your index finger and mutiong the 1 st fret after an open breakdown.    Like for instance    DUN- DUN *Index placement* Dun Dun Dun *index placement* Dun Dun Dun      so forth and so on. Its really hard to explain over the internet lol
seJcARDdaa	I don't think he has a particular meaning.    It's just to demonstrate Ryuuchi's "kiddy side".      Actually, "Kumagoro" translates to "Mr.Bear" :l  So it's completely irrelevant.    He usually uses it when he wants to avoid seriously talking with someone.   It's just something that makes Ryuuichi extra adorable. ^_^|`|a6fb6708bba705283e524493764398c5aa	He's just cute... :P It says something about Ryuichi's character, but other than that, nothing :)

B7qPxYqHaa	1) Nope. I know it is important, but I just don't like it, they both fight too much!    2) Into the Wild, Fire & Ice, Forest of Secrets, Rising Storm, A Dangerous Path, and then Darkest Hour.Then comes Firestar's Quest. Next is Midnight, Moonrise, Dawn ( 1st Graystripe Manga would go here), Starlight, Twilight, and then Sunset. ( I would put the 2nd G-Stripe one here.) (The last G-stripe would go here or after this book) The Sight, Dark River, Outcasts, ECLIPSE, Long Shadows, and finally Sunrise.   3) You actually left out three Clans, SkyClan is the Fifth Clan; and LeopardClan is an Ancient Clan much similar to TigerCLan and LionClan. There is also DarkClan, the Clan that Lionpaw and Heatherpaw made up in the tunnles. But my fave has got to be a tie between Blood, River, and the Tribe.|`|Dwz1se0Saa	1. Err.. sure. I liked it between books 3-5  2.   Series 1:              Into the Wild              Fire and Ice              Forest of Secrets              Rising Storm              A Dangerous Path              The Darkest Hour    Series 2:              Midnight              Moonlight              Dawn              Starlight              Twilight              Sunset  and thats all i've read. havent read firestar's quest or w/e cuz it just got cheesey =/ and the first book in Season 3 is The Sight i think  3.

3HwyJvwPaa	Try Emigrate... the siger is the Rammstein's lead guitarist \m/|`|AA11757826	Not sure what you mean by a mixture of Rammstein and orchestral?     You might be interested in Ramstein's guitarist's side project "Emigrate" but it is more rock than industrial.    the closest thing to industrial/orchestral that i can think of is Judas Priest's album from last year "nostradamous", but i'm not sure if that's what you are looking for maybe youtube it first try http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=n4vtABE-PV...    there is a band who is not as big outside Germany but does some of their stuff in English called "Oomph!" they are a bit more on the pop side of Industrial though.    There is a Slovenian Industrial band called Laibach who sound a bit like Rammstein on some albums and do some of their songs in English, they are a little politically inflamatory though. Try the English stuff off their album "WAT".    Some other Germans who venture into English more often and more successfully than Rammstein are the electro/metal/industrian group Die Krupps, often creditted as one of Rammstein's major influences. you may like the second half ("the metal years") of their recent best of "too much history".    There are american industrial bands like nine inch Nails? or a little Australian band called Voltera. Actually Voltera are bloody fantastic!     Message me something more specific about what you like and i may be more help, but most of the rammstein-like stuff i'm into is in German. Or go to last.fm and listen to Rammstein's station, plays stuff like Rammstein.|`|yZT7m5Qxaa	Try:  RED- has good orchestra music in the background  Showbread- has good industrial music     Skillet is a awesome band by the way.

It would have nothing to do with him, just the fact that I like my privacy and would go nuts having reporters and 'groupies' hanging around my house all the time.    Now, if no one knew he lived there and my neighborhood stayed the same, I'd treat him like I do all my other neighbors. We have BBQ's, swim parties, and just hang out. He'd just be one more person to invite.    He's still just a guy and would probably enjoy being treated normal.|`|9tokSi6Oaa	greet him as a new neighbor and offer to be his first friend or whatever he might want :)|`|bXFua5TFaa	I'd wonder how he got a house on an air force base.|`|gb3pcpMBaa	i would go talk to him and become his best neighbor.  and look out my window alot more.|`|NtFutamfaa	I wouldnt give a crap.....i dont like him...he's not cute|`|l06FQn4laa	Um... well, first I'd wonder what he was doing in a little hick town on a mile long road with three other people on it, but then when I could remember how to breathe, I'd go welcome him to the neighborhood and let him know that although I'm a huge fan, I won't be one of those psychos who want to watch him sleep or whatever. I would not spy on him or scream every time he went out to get the mail. I would treat him just like I do all my other neighbors... well my two other neighbors... anyway, he's just an insanely hot and famous person, so I would just treat him like a normal person. The last thing he needs is to have a screaming fangirl next door.|`|Hgk6563eaa	i heard he was an alcoholic so...i'd mooch off of him because that's what friends do hahaha crazy twilight fans and their crazy fantasies...twilight was the worst movie ever|`|zG1nb4x6aa	I love Robert too.  I would probably try to remain as not-obsessive as possible. Because he might think that I'm a freak and move away.  But I would probably try to chat to him, get to know him.  Not scream, or jump the fence.

Draw, tic tac toe, word search, cross word, read books, magazines. Of course these you can do if you're a passenger.  Name that tune with a friend (sing a certain tune with some lyrics and the other person has to guess). Same with name that movie....say a particular phrase in the tone and action it is said in, and the other person has to guess which movie it came from. But with this one, it helps to know which movies you have seen and which ones the other person has seen.  Read a book of JOKES.  That will certainly pep you up and pass the time as well.  :-)    Hope these help.  :-)  Happy Traveling!|`|5gqc5qyzaa	Drive.

Comic Con isnt just about comics, it has many different categories such as games, art, video production, and you can meet famous people. I went in '06 and saw Jennifer Love Hewitt there. It was cool. You better get the ticket before it runs out, it goes out quickly. Alot of famous people will be there.

Saturn square Mars and Jupiter indicate danger of fractures in the hip area or the arms and ulcers due to bad diet.    Besides this, Moon, Uranus and Venus in bad aspect gives deception in love affairs, due to incompatibility of character and superficalness. If they marry, it will be short-lived and expect sudden separation and legal problems will begin. (Mars square Jupiter). Even is Venus and Marsare in good aspect, the person will become cold and heartless  towards the girl.    Not a good match.I cannot see how you have been told the chart match well. You have to examine the individual chart as well.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	I think that the astrologer is wrong. I see no indications of an extremely long or short life.

a6fb6708bba705283e524493764398c5aa	Apart from the first few episodes of the anime, it is quite different. I couldn't possibly go over all that is different... if you want some examples, however:    -Wrath is a completely different character, as is Sloth and Pride.  ... you know what, it's been awhile, I will review and return XD      But yeah, A LOT is different... and personally, I prefer the manga. You should definitely read it :)      EDIT: okay, more differences.  There is no Dante.... Barry the Chopper has a bigger role (and he falls in love with Hawkeye XD)  Major differences concerning Ed and Al's Father.  How homunculi are made is different; we don't know much about it in the manga yet.    As for what is going on in the manga now (and no, Ed has not died), it really wouldn't make sense to you without reading the manga. There are many characters not in the anime, for one thing... Anyway, if I think of any other major differences I'll come back and add them :)|`|b2K9iZFnaa	Well if u think about it anime usually veers off from the manga because if dubbing of the cussing and wat not. And also the manga probably has extra adventures.(If u need a reference think bout One Piece.) Ed did not die he was sent into London via 1800's. and 1 more thing dont forget to pick up on the new FMA seris coming soon.(It is a prolouge to the original FMA.)|`|3fVsb4NNaa	No he doesn't.    The really only difference is that the anime only follows the first manga. Besides there are too many things that they changed.    Go here to read it onemanga.com

We're big on treating people the way we want to be treated but also treating people the way that they treat us.|`|45725f379db8bff5228f22b2174d8b45aa	Yeah of course he is going to be mad. Us aquarians are big on friendship, honesty and communication. I'm sorry but just going cold on us without saying why and expecting us to chase after you is a turn off. We arr going to just ignore you back because there is no logic in what you have done.     You need to go and say SORRY to him and be HONEST about why you went cold and explain what he did that made you angry and he will forgive you and say sorry for making you upset. In the future if you want to stay with him you must talk out your issues ok or it will never work. We are easy going and not into lots of drama.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Yes he would be very upset and would probably do the same and cut contact with you. Once they are done with you, they never come back again.

While they might not buy a lot of things, they make sure to get the best possible. Sorry if that didn't help, I tried.  = )|`|AA10789032	The Taurus has no difficulty voicing his desires. The need to feel safe and secure is so pronounced that the Taurus is often associated with money, banking, business and trade. They are always accumulating wealth and beautiful things. A Taurus can be very materialistic!  so I can see how/why they spend lots of money.|`|y6wikiJDaa	Interesting point. Taurus men do spend a lot of money. But to do that, they have to earn a lot of money. Taurus is ruled by Venus, so like Libra, they love luxurious things. You might think buying an expensive car or a huge plasma TV is wasteful, but to Taurus, they're simply living the good life they work so hard for.

I wouldn't recommend seeing Revolutionary Road, though, since although it got good reviews, it's kind of a dark movie.

She is in love with the prince of her school. The prince is the perfect boy with good looks, good grades, rich, and friendly. After turning down the 'ice princess' of the school he asks out the main girl. She agrees with out a second thought. Everyone is against their relationship right away. Then comes their first date. But the person she meets and date that day is a totally different guy. Instead of a 'prince' it turns out he has a completely different personality. Mean, rude, jealous and a gangster badass look to him. That's where the story begins about a funny relationship.    Goong: A great manhwa about a rude, mean, prince. A prince of Korea who's grandpa made a promise with a girl's grandpa that their grandchildren would marry. A funny and sometimes sad story about two people in an arranged marriage who absolutely hate each other trying to get along. The girl has many trouble to face within the palace. A great story it actually reminds me alot like Wallflower except different settings.    Akuma de sourou: A story about a girl (second year) who confesses to the wrong guy on accident. She confessed to a popular guy among his first year peers. The son of the principle. *he is a bad boy who does as he pleases* She is so embarresed that she dropes her love note and runs. He ends up keeping it as black mail so that she will become his 'slave?/worker?' She ends up finding out later that he is to be her younger step brother.     Cat Street: really good. The girl is i guess stuborn... more so mean at first.    The bride of the water god: So good. I'd say the guy is stuborn, but she can be too. It's about a girl from a village who is sacraficed to the water god as his bride so that he'll make it rain. After drifting in a boat in the sea the water takes her to the water kingdom. http://manga.gamestotal.com/?/en/read/Th...    Skip beat: good, good, good.    Gakuen alice: Very stuborn boy! Such a great story!    Hana Zakari No Kimitachi E: This is good. But not as much stubborness as the others. The guy character is sometimes stubborn. Same with this manga: Koukou Debut but it is still good.    Merupuri: a prideful boy who is a royal prince from the magic world.

She had made a promise to the boy she loves that she would one day become a singer, but her illness made singing impossible. To make matters even worse, two angels of death, Takuto and Meroko, appeared to Mitsuki and informed her that she only had one year left to live.

She eventually found the boy: a surfer named Kaito Domoto. But as the human form Lucia assumed, named Lucia Nanami, bears very little resemblance to her mermaid form, Kaito cannot recognize her. She cannot tell Kaito who she really is; otherwise, according to mermaid folklore, she would turn into foam. So she tries to convince Kaito into figuring out who she really is (since the legend does not say anything about the other person discovering a mermaid's true identity by himself).  At the same time, Lucia has been told that a group of water creatures or suiyo (??) have invaded the marine world and she must gather the six other Mermaid Princesses and their pearls to bring back the legendary goddess Aqua Regina to stop them. To fulfill this, she joins forces with Hanon and Rina, Mermaid Princesses who came up to dry land, use their pearls, turn into singing idols, and use their voices as an offensive.

WJcH24xCaa	It's ok to drink tea, you could add honey if you like, that's supposed to be soothing.  But don't have it boiling hot, have it warm otherwise it will burn your throat and you'll be worse off.  I always prefer water, and that's what most people will recommend, but just go with what you feel works.  Good Luck!|`|s9Aimt6Jaa	Just liquids,  Water is always best, vitamin water. Just not flavored, there is citric acids that might eventually just weaken your voice.  But water is is best hydrate, I personally drink that, and Arizona green teas, or natural drinks. Nothing artificial. They're only 99cents. My fridge is usually stalked.|`|L0juu80Xaa	Okay, so here's what you need to know in the way of what you drink and how it effects your voice. Caffeine dehydrates you (drys out cords), alcohol thickens the cords (swelling), and dairy coat the cords.    So... will drinking tea make you a better singer? Not really. Many singers drink certain teas to help sooth their voice when the cords are thick from congestion or lack of sleep, but ultimately tea will not help a normal voice sound any better.    From this vocal coaches perspective, the best liquid for the voice is water and it's best received at room temperature as extreme hot or cold could be somewhat of a shock to the cords. However, to air a personal opinion, while I know all these "rules," I also know that it's unrealistic to think that I'll never break them, so that's where creating a good vocal technique can come in handy... you don't have to worry about magic or hocus pocus to create a better end result.    Btw, your question has inspired me. I am now going to write a new post on what certain foods and beverages can do to the voice on my singing tips blog website. Feel free to check it out in the next day or two at http://singingtipsblog.com.    I hope that this helps!

dTOiazUpaa	Hi here are some of the main characters of the private series:  *Also there might be spoilers (sorry) but hope it helps!!*    Reed Brennan  The collected, curious protagonist, Reed is a brown-haired girl from Pennsylvania who enters Easton Academy on a scholarship at the beginning of the first book. Her troubled family background and otherwise placid past makes her overly ambitious and docile when presented with exciting opportunities. Though gifted both academically and athletically, her first major aspiration at Easton is to get into Billings House, which holds the allure of great social privileges and respect. She manages to get the attention of the Billings Girls, and a series of initiations to test her credibility follows.  Noelle Lange  Noelle is a brown-haired, dark-eyed young woman who initially serves as 'leader' of the girls in Billings House. Fiercely loyal to her friends, she is the implied counterpart to Reed, being similarly skilled in lacrosse and soccer, and apparently coming from a shaken family of her own. However, her privileged upbringing tends to make her blunt and sometimes insensitive, as she enjoys intimidating other students as well as the Easton staff. According to some classmates, she can't live without drama in her life. She tends to know everything about everyone, even the things no one else knows. Noelle possesses a mysterious long, red scar along her stomach, just above her hipbone. She has an unstable longtime romantic relationship with another senior named Dash McCafferty.  Ariana Osgood  The series' muse, Ariana is the quietest member of the group, possessing blue eyes, ethereal white-blond hair, and a penetrating stare. She is known for always having her nose in a book, and is considered to be Reed's first friend in Billings, as it was Ariana who introduced Reed to the others. Beneath her exterior, Ariana is eventually revealed to have darker issues as the series progresses. She becomes the lead character of the prequel and spin-off.  Kiran Hayes  The most beautiful Billings Girl, Kiran is a model with green eyes and light-brown hair. She has extremely good sense in fashion, and is capable of turning people into superstar lookalikes. She is also known to be shallow and 'bratty' to others. Beneath the surface, Kiran is troubled by alcoholism, which can lead to repercussions for herself and the others. Kiran is also known for her talents of mixing alcoholic drinks.  Taylor Bell  A brainy, sensitive member of the group who possesses messy dark blonde curls and blue eyes; Reed's first impression of her is of a "cherub." She claims to have a photographic memory, and possesses a sweeter and more innocent nature than that of her three friends, as she is often visibly sensitive to others' feelings.  Cheyenne Martin  A series antagonist, Cheyenne is a controlling girl whose ambition is more aggressive than Reed's. She has a public feud with Noelle, and seeks to take her spot as leader of Billings House. Despite being on opposing 'sides,' Cheyenne and Reed tolerate each other at first, but they are thrown into conflict during the events of the fifth book, Inner Circle, when the new year at Easton begins.  Thomas Pearson  Reed's first boyfriend at Easton, Thomas is a good-looking, mysterious senior with anger management and alcoholism issues. He carries a sense of recklessness and danger, which automatically attracts Reed and several other girls at Easton. In Private, Reed discovers that Thomas is a drug dealer and that he comes from a wealthy yet dysfunctional family. He disappears at the end of the first book, a development that Reed does not take kindly.  Josh Hollis  Reed's primary romantic interest, Joshua (often called Josh by his fellow schoolmates and friends) is a blond-curled, green/blue-eyed roommate and best friend of Thomas Pearson in Private. He later becomes Reed's boyfriend in Untouchable. They broke up at the end of Legacy. He has a number of medical conditions that require him to take pills daily. Later he develops a relationship with Ivy Slade, Reed's new friend.  Constance Talbot  Reed's talky, informative roommate during her stay in Bradwell House, possessing emerald-green eyes, curly red hair and freckles. She becomes a Billings Girl in the fifth book. She also dates Walt Whittaker, who she's had a crush on for a long time.  Sabine Dulac  A newcomer in the fifth book. She comes from Martinique and has a French accent. Like most of the Billings Girls, Sabine possesses physical beauty. She becomes Reed's roommate, and the two of them form a strong friendship. In Legacy Noelle returns to Easton and Sabine grows jealous of Reed and Noelle's relationship. She is one of the few to stand up to Noelle, though it usually goes unnoticed by the former. In Revelation it is revealed that Sabine has more than a few skeletons in her closetones that were better left hidden.  Dash McCafferty  Described as having Abercrombie & Fitch good-looks, Dash is Noelle's on-again off-agai|`|S85ux209aa	Oh I love the private series..it's so intense!

"Diet pills, surgery  Photoshopped pictures in magazines  Telling them how they should be  It doesn't make sense to me"    They're singing about how much fake talent is in the media industry. Broken homes, dreams of superstardom, greed....    "Rich guys driving big SUVs  While kids are starving in the streets"    That's self-explanatory. The song is just about all the imperfections in the modern world, and how the band thinks everyone is going crazy, and begging us to open our eyes and realise the error of our ways.    Or something like that.|`|bt2eqT7Caa	good song , good song

Ow3O7h4caa	These 2 signs love freedom and independence as well as outdoor activities. Both are optimistic with a strong mutual understanding due to your open-mindedness and honesty toward each other. What is good here is you will each respect your space and privacy. On another level,you both love challenges and dislike to be restricted in your freedom.     Sagittarius is the flexible one which means that Aries will be in charge, the boss, the leader....  But don't push it too hard, because Sagittarius  can be very direct and blunt and will bring Aries down a notch or two. Communication is almost perfect, almost simultaneous and full of love, because you understand each other. Sagittarius will keep Aries on their toes.    For a long-term relationship, you would need other aspects to sustain this relationship because these two rush headlong into situations. Both hate to commit which is a plus for these relationship. With both being just as idealistic in matters of love and affection, they could very well make it for the long haul if their are stabilizing aspects or other elements to offset some of this buoyancy and impusivity.|`|8uXSHWYxaa	Definitely a good match!

Here's the Plot:  Three teenage high school dropouts want to enter a skateboard tournament. When they try to register, they find out they must have to have a high school diploma to enter, so they go back to school to study and get their GED. It's a down to earth comedy with a lot of heart.    Seeing as it's Feb. 3, 2009 I'd say that answers your question.    Cheers,  Steve

That way, the producers think they are so clever thinking that its just too deep for anyone to ever understand.|`|2TNFQAQEaa	If you really must know...    The main character, Anna, accidentally killed her dying mom and sister after finding her dad cheating with a nurse.  They sent her to a psych ward after the accident, and after a year or so, the doctor at the ward tells Anna to go home and "finish what she started."  Anna misinterprets the words, and comes home, ready to kill some more out of sheer insanity.  Anna believes her sister is still alive and is egging her on to kill the nurse her dad was having an affair with.  Anna gets it in her head that her new mom (the nurse) is some serial killer, when in truth, the actual serial killer was her roommate at the psych ward.  While her dad is away, she kills the woman and gets sent right back to the ward.    There's alot more to it, but that's the most of it.|`|5qCiUkTwaa	The twist was that Everything was all in Anna's head    The dream about Matt she was having was really her Hallucinating and she was really outside while Matt was on the cliff he grabbed her wrist to pull himself up but then she yanked her wrist out of his grip because in her Hallucination Matt was really dead and trying to kill her.    When she saw The step-mom and her dad in the room making out she was angered so she went in her moms room grabbed some oil to kill Rachel but left the oil running on accident. When she pushed Alex out of the way Alex bumped the Lantern on the floor and the fire got to the oil. Then Anna's and Alex's mom called Alex in and when she walked in she blew up with her mother.    She Never got Alex's letters because she never sent them because she was dead.    She killed Rachel because again she was Hallucinating and in her mind Rachel didn't let her get the knife and Alex was behind her. But it was really Anna who killed Rachel by stabbing her multiple times and then dragging her to the trash can. She doesn't remember though because right after she went to sleep and she thought Alex killed her anyway.    In reality Rachel was undressing her to get her out of those day time clothes and slipped on some pajamas for her to wear while she sleeps.  She tranquilized her so she would calm down and just go to sleep. Alex was just some Imaginary form of her sister that was in Anna's head and she thought was really there until her father said that she died a year ago in the fire (notice on while he said that the Imaginary sister said to not listen to him because it was Anna saying that her father is lieing) and then Alex (the most bloody and the one with the knife in the hand) dissapeared and then Anna became even more bloody and got a knife in her hand. she saw one last glimpse of Alex in the mirror and then she dissapeared for good.

29cLAPVqaa	Okay. I tried out for American Idol when I turned 16 and what you have to do is wait until they are calling the casting audtions for them. Then you go on their website and print out the form. Then you fill it out and keep it. Then you go the day before your audition day to the audition place, drop off your form, and get a bracelet. Then the next morning you wait in line until it's time for you to go. I waited 10 hours to sing 5 seconds of a song for them to tell me I wasn't unique enough. Maybe wear a costume or something. And FYI you have to audtion twice before you go to Randy, Paula, Simon and that new chick. So, keep in mind that it isn't as glorious as it appears. Good luck!!|`|FAaePWPWaa	All I have to say is don't waste your time trying out because that show is so rigged. Before you even meet the actual judges you have to I through other judges  and they make the descison of whether or not you see the actual judges.

Much like the North cutting off the supply to the South during our Civil War.     Yes, Odo and the female Shape Shifter are of the same planet and species. However, the female Shape Shifter was not the last of her kind. She never was. The fact is, the Shape Shifters were dying. They were dying because when Odo was last on Earth (for a physical exam of some kind), Section 31 somehow implanted a virus into Odo. They knew that sooner or later that Odo would go to his home planet, become a liquid and enter "The Great Pool" to join the other Shape Shifters.     In the final episode, Kira and Odo are not married. She merely escorts him to his home planet so he can join his brethren and cure them. How was he cured? Dr. Bashir and O'Brien were able to trick Sloan of Section 31 to get the antidote and cure Odo.     Hope this helps.|`|cdpW5aajaa	The Dominion was a group from beyond the Worm Hole. The Worm Hole was located in Bajoran space. As a member of the Federation, Bajor requested help from the Federation in patrolling and defending the Worm Hole and their planet. The mission of the DS-9 was to protect the planet Bajor and the Worm Hole from any invading force including an invading force that came through the Worm Hole. The Dominion wanted control of the Worm Hole, that`s what that war was about. It just turns out in the end that the Dominion is ruled by a female Shape-Shifter like Odo, she was under the impression that she was the last of her kind, that`s why the Dominion was ruthless. Still, they had a peace-treaty and Odo married Major Kira and I then I stopped following the series for a while so I lost track of the story.

c2BLtOkgaa	It's a little early to speculate, but I don't think it was Wes. He seems too obvious.    Starr would be an interesting choice, and she kind of has motive. Plus it would explain why Todd is just sitting there holding the knife- perhaps he's planning on taking the fall for her.|`|nndflDc9aa	Either Wes or even Cole or even Marty lol who knows she is crazy this days. or even Ramzy lol maybe Schuyler.?|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Too obvious to be Todd, I think Wes...maybe Schuyler.|`|AA12390047	Janet supposedly had ties to Wes and has messed up his family years ago and Wes did it!  Can't be Todd or Starr - they're the main characters.  Has to be someone on a short-term contract.|`|gxl6oBpJaa	OH MY GOSH!!! She died!? I saw her leave the hotel or wherever but then I changed the channel or something. Did that happen on today's episode!?|`|mIUjnujeaa	I think she killed herself.... They make it look like Todd because he was holding thr knife when Tea found him but Marty is going to think it was Wes according to spoilers so I don't think it was either of them or why would they point to who it was so early. Also I had the feeling when Tea walked into the house she would find that Lee killed herself I just thought it would be hanging...|`|9c1495b913e79f54e1875a4a96d3a768aa	I read today that Tea will take the blame and say it was in self defense.  Starr being the one to kill her would be an interesting story.  But if she turns out to be the one, they will determine she was under depression or something because of the baby dieing.  Which means she will get off from the charges.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I think it was Wes.

NnaJaDJoaa	No, rythm guitar is a style of playing a guitar not a kind of guitar    the role of rhythm guitar is most often to provide the chord sequence or "progression" of a composition, frequently providing the rhythm or "beat" as well, usually as part of a rhythm section. In rock music and many of its sub-genres, a typical rhythm section minimally comprises rhythm and bass guitars, a drum kit and frequently a keyboard instrument, but may include a variety of other instruments, such as additional percussion, MIDI instruments, drum machines, turntables (for playing "samples" and "scratching") and equipment for playback of pre-recorded rhythmic accompaniment.    A guitarist "playing rhythm" plays a sequence of chords or arpeggios which embody the chord progression or "changes" that support the melody lines performed by the other instruments or voices. In contrast, the role of the lead guitar is to provide melody, countermelody and solos.    In rock music, the most common way to construct chord progressions is to play "triads", each comprising a root, third and fifth note of a given scale, or four-note chords, which include the sixth, seventh or ninth note of the scale. In some cases, the chord progression is implied with a simplified sequence of two or three notes, sometimes called a "riff", that is repeated throughout the composition. In heavy metal (or just "metal") music, this is typically expanded to more complex sequences comprising a combination of chords, single notes and palm muting. The rhythm guitar part in compositions performed by more technically oriented bands often include riffs employing complex lead guitar techniques. In some genres, especially metal, the audio signal from the rhythm guitar's output is often subsequently heavily distorted by overdriving the guitar's amplifier to create a thicker, "crunchier" sound for the palm-muted rhythms.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Wow....no. its the same guitar. Maybe you'll use a different pickup. Not that you know what pickups are    But holy dick Pantera and Metallica are my favorite bands. take back what I just said. much Respect.|`|Catsy82Caa	rhythm guitar refers to a method of playing on stage. when there's two guitarists on stage, one usually plays lead guitar (riffs and solos etc) and the other plays the backing rhythm.|`|0RstDjygaa	no its standard different type of playing|`|IOIG1I9Saa	no, rhythm is just a kind of playing the guitar.|`|7qt4aQGYaa	Its just a regular guitar, you play the same way. the only difference is that rhythm is played along with the bass using mostly chords and seperate from the lead guitar.|`|JBK0I9aGaa	it's a standard guitar.  it's called rhythm guitar due to it's purpose.  while the lead guitar is doing it's thing, the rhythm guitar (my personal favorite) is helping keep things together along with the bass and drums.

To me real rap or hip hop is artists like nas , pac , biggie , and big l. People who can say something and back their words up. Plus they all spoke about stuff thats real and that people could relate to. Today rap music is all about people killing other people and having lots of money. Rap today lost its meaning now its all about who can sell the most ringtones. I feel real hip hop is that of the past .

Mind reading would be really interesting, but I think there are things better left unknown. I wouldnt want people reading my thoughts; so I wouldnt read others. And mind control - that would just be too bad-guy-ish!    Telekinesis would be endlessly entertaining, making everything float around, but doesnt seem all that useful.    I wouldnt be too into the combat-type powers, but they make good examples if youre looking to consider them: laser / ice / water / fire / electricity / stun beams, invulnerability, superstrength, magical martial arts    X-ray vision meh, that could get creepy. But along the same lines, enhanced senses? EXTRA sensory perception?    Healing powers: ooh, now THAT would be a smart choice. (Although I bet it would come with some dumb restriction that you could heal anyone EXCEPT yourself. But if not) Heck, why not take it a step further and make it immortality? (Yeah, yeah, lots of stories with the moral that thats more of a curse, but whatever!)    How about just magical conjure-up-stuff powers, whatever thats called? The stuff witches or wizards or sorcerers or anime magical girls can do with the wave of a wand. Thatd be helpful.    Speaking of magical girls: Transformation / shapeshifting? Secret identity? Animal parts, or communication with animals, or weather control / harnessing the elements?    Communication in itself is a big thing. Who would you want to communicate with? Besides animals, theres natural stuff like plants or simply other languages? Or ghosts!? INANIMATE OBJECTS, omigosh! I might even change my main choice for that. You could talk to your toys, or, I dunno, electronics* The only setback would be that you cant take them for granted anymore, haha youd have to respect their personalities and stuff. Apologize to your pencil when you drop it on the floor, because youll hear it say ouch. (Also, another power: animation of inanimate objects?)    The power of illusions! But thats kind of creepyand phony. How about actual reality-warping?    Self-replication! Everyone has wanted, at some point, to be in two places at once.    *A good one I read about is manipulation of technology, which I guess can be interpreted in whatever way you find awesomest. Obviously Id hope no one wants to use it to mess with government statistics or bank/tax totals or lame villainous stuff like that. I could see absorbing instant knowledge from technological devices (or from books, whatever). But Id find it awesomest if I could get myself inside the internet, video games, or movies (as long as it doesnt appear to other people watching the movie awkward).    Whatever you pick, dont pick the Midas Touch or any spontaneous money-making thing. Our economy has enough problems!      A superpower, basically, can be ANYTHING. The possibilities are infinite. If you want to get really creative, then look around the room and pick the first thing you see to associate with something.  I just saw a sticker book. Magnetism? Sticking to or climbing on walls?  I just saw a refrigerator. Cold / heat manipulation through touch? Making edible food out of inedible objects?  I just saw a microphone. Sonic boom voice? Healing through song? Entrancement via singing?  I just saw a paper. Well, theres that manga Read or Die Maybe that author was having this same debate and chose that power by looking at a random book in the room!  A camera. What if you could take pictures of anything you saw just by blinking an eye?

Rather than his musical Genius which is sad. But hey if I were him I wouldn't let some overrated band rip me off I would sue too.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	I think he should create a band (and not just instrumentals)|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Well considering that people think he's god I'd say no    EDIT: Shred, I agree but being underrated is not the same as being under-recognized. Those that do know of him think great things about him. So his "rating"  is not low, he's just not a household name for most average people like a Coldplay.    Oh and Shred if you read this, can you maybe try to answer my Cavalera Conspiracy question?|`|Catsy82Caa	no he's quite well known and people are very well aware of what a good guitarist he is. he taught kirk hammett how to play, no? surfing with the alien is an ace record.    blah blah blah coldplay wahh wahh they copied like five notes ohhh they r so rip off and joe is god dude get over it|`|rRCTvT7Saa	No.  However, I do feel he is overrated.  I mean, he's obviously a great guitarist, but still a bit overrated.|`|OyT5oxFbaa	Amazing, yes. Underrated? Not at all.    I saw him back in November, and I can't tell you how many people showed up to see Satch. I consider myself lucky to have seen that concert! His fans are crazy obsessed, and he is freakin amazing. He has tons of fans...|`|JuGZ2AP1aa	aside from hendrix and clapton and all those beasts,   the top guitarists of today id say are satriani and vai,|`|QTRaACCtaa	Yes.

108e74378ce116f1a1ab7712a41679a6aa	Pretty good. I like the part about "Just turn around and start the fight." I think it would be a good slow rock song (I think all lyrics should go to rock songs, but that might just be me). I can't think of what you should add to it, but it needs a little more spice somehow...maybe more figurative language. Other than that, it was really good, no matter what anyone else on here says.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	It's fair. Is it rap ?

BTvSJcFlaa	According to the The DC Comics Encyclopedia, the Joker stands 6'5" tall and weighs 192 lbs.     As for his age, he was created in 1940. He was given a revamp in the 60s and again in the 80s or 90s. I don't really know if his actual age was given, but I've always figured he was in his mid to late 40s.    Oh, well. 2 out of 3 ain't bad.|`|P8Qrds77aa	To clear up Sykopup's answer, the reason he can't give an age is because DC has never given one. The main reason why is because the Joker's true origin is still a bit of a mystery. He changes it all the time.

fUqfFmvRaa	I LOVE IT!!!  Sure it may be a little sad for my tastes, but it comes from the heart and you can see it in the writing!  If I try to write something it turns out cheesy and lame and sounds really fake.  I think it looks really good and I wish I could here the finished project!  It will sound amazing!            Oh and I have no idea why someone thinks its plagerism...  just because there have been songs about similar stuff does not make it plagerism!  If so there would only be like 100 songs out there tops!  its just like books!  so many are similar but that doesn't make them plagersim!  I've read some books that were written before the Twilight series that had amazing parallels but it wasn't plagerism or it wouldn't have been published.  This is pretty much the same thing so whoever said it was plagerism seriously needs to get a life if all he has to do is make others feel bad about something that they wrote!  Some people are so cynical it's disgusting!  What is the world coming to these days?

The actual reason she is so tanned is because she was on the swim team and tans very easily. She likes a boy, Toji, who she heard only likes non-tanned girls. This causes her to question who she is and have low self esteem. She spends a lot of time trying to remake herself into the girl she believes he wants. However, she has a friend, Sae, who likes to go behind Momo's back and make her life terrible, mostly by trying to take Toji away from her. All the while there's another boy, Kairi, who is in love with Momo.   Genres: drama, romance   Themes: School, Teenagers     Itazura Na kiss   Plot Summary: In the romantic comedy story, a high school girl named Kotoko finally tells a fellow senior named Naoki that she has loved him from afar since she saw him on their first day of high school. However, Naoki, a haughty "super-ikemen" (handsome male) with smarts and sports talent, rejects her offhand. Fate intervenes when a mild earthquake ruins Kotoko's family house. While the house gets rebuilt, Kotoko and her dad stay at the home of her dad's childhood friend...whose son is Naoki  Genres: comedy, drama, romance     tokyo mew mew  Plot Summary: On her first date with the cutest boy in school, Ichigo is zapped by a mysterious ray that scrambles her DNA with that of the endangered Iriomote wildcat. The next day, Ichigo discovers that she has developed the agility (and occasionally the ears and tail) of a cat, as well as the power to transform into a pink-haired superheroine, Mew Ichigo. She and four other girls, each endowed with the genes of a different "Red Data" animal, have been selected for the top-secret Mew Project, which aims to protect the Earth from an alien menace known as Deep Blue  Genres: adventure, comedy, magic, romance, science fiction, slice of life, supernatural   Themes: Aliens, Magical Girl, Sentai, Superhero   Age rating: All Ages (Nothing objectionable)    Full Moon O Sagashite   Plot Summary: Twelve-year-old Kouyama Mitsuki was devastated when she was diagnosed with a malignant tumor of the throat. She had made a promise to the boy she loves that she would one day become a singer, but her illness made singing impossible. To make matters even worse, two angels of death, Takuto and Meroko, appeared to Mitsuki and informed her that she only had one year left to live. This news provides an even greater motivation for Mitsuki to fulfill her dreams, and with a little bit of divine intervention, she begins her quest to become a professional singer so she can be reunited with Eichi before time runs out.   Genres: comedy, drama, romance, supernatural   Themes: magical girl, music, shinigami    Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch   Lucia, Mermaid Princess of the North Pacific Ocean, sets out to land to find the boy she saved from a shipwreck seven years before the beginning of the story, the boy to whom she entrusted her pink pearl. She eventually found the boy: a surfer named Kaito Domoto. But as the human form Lucia assumed, named Lucia Nanami, bears very little resemblance to her mermaid form, Kaito cannot recognize her. She cannot tell Kaito who she really is; otherwise, according to mermaid folklore, she would turn into foam. So she tries to convince Kaito into figuring out who she really is (since the legend does not say anything about the other person discovering a mermaid's true identity by himself).  At the same time, Lucia has been told that a group of water creatures or suiyo (??) have invaded the marine world and she must gather the six other Mermaid Princesses and their pearls to bring back the legendary goddess Aqua Regina to stop them. To fulfill this, she joins forces with Hanon and Rina, Mermaid Princesses who came up to dry land, use their pearls, turn into singing idols, and use their voices as an offensive.

However, these young men and parts of the rest of their family (both close and distant) hold a curse; if they are hugged by the opposite gender, they transform into animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Everyday is an adventure for sweet Tohru, as she gets to know everyone in the large family better (especially Yuki and Kyo), in both common and bizarre situations. But, the Sohma Family curse is certainly no laughing matter... it also holds horrible cruelity and heartbreak.  Genres: comedy, drama, romance, supernatural     Lovely complex  Plot Summary: Risa Koizumi, taller than the average girl, and Atsushi Ootani, shorter than the average guy - their constant bickering and comical love-hate relationship is well-known throughout the school.

mIEiQcyMaa	See if you can find and rent Close Your Eyes.  It freaked the crap out of me, and doesn't have any sex (that just doesn't belong in a really good horror movie, anyways).  Another good movie that is more psychologically creepy than gore-filled is Frailty, it's a really good story with a sweet plot twist at the end that is unexpected.|`|7d2d6d4d7776168256be9f967571c2caaa	The Grudge 1&2....3 is right around the corner.|`|By2ZR1lfaa	yoo watch faces of death reale dead boddyes dis kool upp g ebay got it amzom if looking rent by thing kool  saw films roxs yooo upp g i kool peace|`|iQAGeVjsaa	[Rec]|`|BYMaGYIvaa	i agree faces of death is scary....|`|2QuGuphYaa	The original "Psycho" starring Anthony Perkins in black and white will scare the **** out of ANYONE.    Even if you are young and don't like to watch black and white, give this movie a try.  It will keep an eerie feeling in you throughout the whole movie.  DO NOT rent the remake starring Vince Vaughn, cuz its crap.  The original Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock will make all of you crap your pants.    I also suggest The Shining if you haven't seen that yet.|`|ijVuZsDXaa	Silence of The Lambs, Hannible Rising, Jeepers Creepers, It, Physco, American Physo,Rose Red, and the Excorsist.|`|cHTQvCr2aa	I'm almost 22 and in my entire life only two movies have scared me to the point that I didn't sleep or had to sleep with the lights on or was afraid of going out into the dark hallway, etc. and they are Pet Sematary and The Grudge (the one with Sarah Michelle Gellar).|`|jlngtrj7aa	The Exorcist. If you haven't seen this, you need to at some point in your life. It does have one sexual scene but its probably not what you would expect AT ALL(haha). It has quite a bit of foul language too. Even though the movie is over 30 years old it still manages to scare the sh*t out of me (in fact, there are stories of people being institutionalized after watching it).  Without a doubt the best horror movie ever made.    I just finished watching The Shining- another classic. Very suspensful but also very long and it has some sexual scenes.    The Exorcism of Emily Rose is good too.    So is One Missed Call, if you like to go for cheap scares haha.

One day, Yuki and Tohru come to visit him at his shop, and find him fitting a wedding dress for a man! Yuki and Ayame get a chance to talk and Yuki realizes that he has to accept Ayame for the way he is.    Ayame likes to dress up in women's clothing from time to time. His only intention is to bond with Yuki (no matter how much it might seem like he only wants to piss everyone off).

Dear little buttercup, with your eyes so blue  Oh little buttercup, you' re a dream come true  You and I will settle down in a cottage built for two  Oh, dear little buttercup, I love you...    Everybody !    My little buttercup, has the sweetest smile  Dear little buttercup won't you stay awhile  You and I will settle down in a cottage built for two, oh    Dear little buttercup  Sweet little buttercup,  My little buttercup  I love you|`|LptR3RWgaa	"Build Me Up Buttercup" written by Mike d'Abo and Tony Macaulay, and released by The Foundations with Colin Young singing the lead vocals.
2TNFQAQEaa	The Dark Knight is on DVD and Blu-Ray now, but due to heavy Oscar attention (see: Heath Ledger), the film did get a re-release to IMAX theaters only on the 23rd.    Personally, I thought the movie itself was fantastic, but the IMAX personally toned the experience DOWN for me.  The film isn't in 3-D like Harry Potter 5 was, it was just 20 minutes of bigger screen.  Plus, most of the shots that were bigger were just crane shots of Gotham.    The biggest problem with IMAX was I kept twisting my head around to see what was going on on the big screens, and I think I honestly sprained something jerking around trying to see what was happening.    My opinion - I would just get it on DVD (its probably cheaper, anyway), but if you must see it in IMAX, then whatever.|`|VKkmB0kYaa	Yes.    http://www.imax.com/
GGAgxzJNaa	I'm gonna take a wild guess, here.  "Brown Eyed Girl" by Van Morrison has those lyrics and a Jamaican sound:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxyhp9Kfc...|`|WJDJ2vIoaa	First thought was "my brown eyed girl - do you remember when we used to sing"...

B4UG9xDnaa	1. Airplane cabin?  2. was there a 6th bullet? because he could be shot with another bullet.|`|j8XFGoLFaa	1.   It's a painting.   The cabin was drawn in?    2.  Someone shot him?|`|oVlWMrxoaa	1. airplane cabin  2. there are 6 shots in a round he killed himself with the 6th one|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	air plane cabin and i have no clue, the only type of bullets other then gun i can think of is punctuation or whatever that is so i wanna say something dumb like he was drawn on some kids notes sheet but i doubt that's it|`|KCVGFmKCaa	1.mud slide?  2.they went through him|`|uhvKLEgGaa	1.   A tornado blew it there  2.  He shot 5 bullets in a circle, laid down and shot himself with the 6th one.    I know sounds kind of dumb but that's the best I can come up with.  if i'm wrong can you tell me the answer?|`|u6iphX5Gaa	air plane cabin|`|cc326e0c24100f2594dc0c73e3a40704aa	1. The lady was in the cabin of a plane that crashed into the side of a mountain.    2. The man was in a room with bullet proof glass. He tried to shoot his way out and couldn't as the bullets bounced off the glass and hit him.    Ok he choked on licorice bullets???|`|bBn1WNAYaa	1 ; she was in an airplane cabin which had crashed.  2 ; he was eating those chocolate bullet things, and then on his sixth one, chocked, dropping the remaining five around him on the floor.|`|zddIYf9vaa	1. plane    2. guy had a stroke while loading the gun    bad guesses I know :P|`|2liwk8yKaa	Aeroplane  He chocked on the licorice bullet he was eating and the remaining 5 fell on the floor.
0GTKBM4Zaa	it's  alright i would prefer it if you kept the chorus the same al way through the song i also need to know the tune...coz just by reading it makes it sound REALLY depressing lol  but it has got GREAT potential keep working on it!  |`|FvpktkB8aa	yeah sounds goodd 2 mee:)|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Hey pretty cool, usually im not into rhyming stuff but I liked this.  Im curious to hear the music to it|`|985b69c21f5ec27c902473285145042baa	Very nice. I like it.|`|108e74378ce116f1a1ab7712a41679a6aa	You need to find a damn band and get that recorded cuz I would love to hear it with music. You're very talented for being so young. Keep it up and hopefully you'll be a rock star someday. Maybe you and I should share lyrics.....mine aren't as good as yours, though...|`|io4LZ229aa	I think it was good though usually, the chorus doesn't change or the refrain or whatever. Also, there was no bridge which is when the music changes and everything. I'm 14 too and I write songs. I think it was good. SOmething that I'd write and probably listen to with the right music.|`|iOKoi16qaa	u take too long 2 rhyme|`|1D9TEIwEaa	sounds good. i wish i could hear the melody to it.|`|qNNcJ2B6aa	yee its good but its gonna be hard to find a nice beat to it.....    good luck|`|pjgfuYQsaa	That is sooo good! !!!!!!!!!!!

KN36rGMvaa	His moniker was a bit of a joke to poke fun at one of Garm's aliases, Fiery G. Maelstrom: "Icy S. Vortex", with the first words being opposite elements, the middle initial being the first letters of their common names, and the last word being a powerful circular current of water.|`|CjBLCFg3aa	http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=What...

KHC2oE8iaa	where do teens your age get down at? where can yall go to listen to music? i dont think a place like that exists. you'd have to come up with a way where kids your age would be able to hear your stuff. how about this. every school has dances right? why not get with the dance commitees of schools in your area and charge them for your services. make sure you have videos of you mixing your own stuff. that will be your resume.
oCVOJKn6aa	Lol, that guys list isn't anything similar to Tech N9ne. Here man this is as close as a list will get.    Rappers like Tech N9ne:  Kutt Calhoun (probably the closest thing to Tech N9ne)  Twista  BG Bulletwound  Doomsday Productions (sometimes)    It really depends what you're looking for, someone who sounds like Tech, or talks about the things Tech talks about?|`|RrQNJsVsaa	Yo, dawg, there is alwayz simular artists. Da Biga Niga, Ern2it, Eminem, Killa Dawgz, GanGunz, Eazy-E, Frank-instine, SPM-Hustle Town, Spoonie Gee, Gritz, Dat Man & Da High-Jacker, Tit-man, and more dawg! I hear Will Smith sings songs like dat 2!|`|Ynr8YTSVaa	Bone Thugs, they flow and rap fast, just like TEcha Ninna
