BTW- you cannot worry enough- it's called love!|`|AA12128656	since you only picked her up this morning, it's possible that she's just sensitive to the pain from the surgery.  give her a little bit, the sedative she had may have caused her to forget she had to go. i'd wait a day or so and keep an eye on her.|`|GSf09ALBaa	You may be worrying too much.  I have a male terrier mix and when he was neutered (which is a very simple operation) he was a big baby for 2 weeks.  I had my Pit spayed and she acted like nothing even happened.  It is probably just your dog.  Some dogs can endure pain better than others.    Just watch for anything like vomiting, diarrhea and check the incision regularly.|`|0R0uRNuIaa	During a spay, most puppies expearience pains whent they first come home. Pain meds should work. This is all normal though. The accidents can occur, specially when a spay involves removing her whole reproductive systen, because Her bladder has been effected by the surguries.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Walking slowly and gingerly may be because she can feel the stretching from her incision area. Sometimes dogs don't want to use the bathroom at all because it is sore.  Spaying is considered major abdominal surgery.  Make sure she doesn't do ANY running or jumping for at least 5 days.  I hope all checks out for her tomorrow.|`|FewhKlx9aa	This is painful for her as it is major surgery.You should'nt have her walking around she should be kept quite and no walking or jumping and make sure she does'nt lick the stitches as she can infect the. She has stitches on the inside and outside so you have to be extremely careful for a week or so and you should have a collar for her so she can't reach her stitches..You need to carry her outside and carry her back in to go to the bathroom as you can see she can't do it herself...|`|T7b7tKvraa	she might still have some drugs in her system which are making her act unusual.    My cat had some sleeping meds on a plane when we got her, and she was really trashed 15 to 24 hours after taking them.  She was fumbling all over the house etc.|`|ADjeuxIiaa	She just had a major surgery. The site is probably sore, hence the whining and sitting every few steps.  The accidents could be due to how she is feeling. If she is worn out and in pain from being spayed, she may not feel up to going outside, or holding it. Give her time, love, and encouragement.|`|oL3AoLPsaa	She's probably fine. The accidents are pretty normal I think. The rest sounds like she's just sore. When they do surgery, there's always a chance of other organs popping out of the incision, it's nothing to worry about, but when that does happen, it makes them pretty sore. Nothing to worry about, she sounds like she'll be fine.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	Different b1tches react in different ways. Most of mine have been fine but one wouldn't even attempt to stand - because the stitches were pulling. It could well be the stitches are causing a little discomfort. Hopefully, the accidents are just a result of the effects of the drugs/anaesthetic she has had. It's too early for it to be spay incontinence.|`|0hTvKlD5aa	My dog's pain medication after surgery gave her an upset tummy and she had a couple of accidents in the house.      You can't worry too much, and if you're concerned, just take her back to the vet. You paid for the surgery, so they should be willing to take a look for free.

When I was a kid that was my first dog, loved her!! Training is usually not a problem with beagles, but being a hound SOMETIMES they can be stubborn about house breaking. Their lifespan is usually pretty long, my Beagle lived for 13 years. Yes they shed, but, proper brushing(couple few times a week) should get that down to a minimum. Good luck with your new dog!! Beagles are a GREAT family dog!!|`|0UxjzoUxaa	Sure why not?|`|MNLbVQ2kaa	Beagles live on average 12-15 years. Be sure you're ready to make a lifelong commitment to your pet. Don't forget dog food, toys, treats, bedding, routine and emergency veterinary care, and kennel expenses if no one will be able to care for your dog when you go away. Be prepared to spend at least $500 per year on your beagle.   Beagles are high energy dogs and need daily exercise to burn off that excess energy. And, being scent hounds, they need to "get out and sniff".   Beagles are very clever, but they are inherently stubborn and can be mischievous or even destructive when it comes to acquiring food (beagles are notorious "chow hounds"). But they respond well to diligent and consistent training, particularly if a positive approach with food rewards is used. This is true for puppies as well as adult dogs.

But they respond well to diligent and consistent training, particularly if a positive approach with food rewards is used. This is true for puppies as well as adult dogs.   when beagles are outside, they must always be either on a leash or in a securely fenced area. If they are loose, they will run away. While they are busy tracking whatever scent gets their interest, they will not pay any attention to cars. Next, most beagles will bark and howl on occasion, and this can be a great source of annoyance for neighbors. And lastly, beagles shed a lot. This is how all short-haired dogs maintain their coat length. If you have allergies or consider yourself a "neat freak", beware!|`|YLYAo2zmaa	Beagles make wonderful pets inside, they are smart and reasonably easy to train, they do need a play area to run, either a fenced yard or a puppy park.  I have several beagles, and my neighbors only live about 75 feet from my kennel area, I have lived here 10 years and have never had a complaint about barking or anything else for that matter.  We had one beagle live to be 15 and another who was almost 15.   Do not take your beagle outside without a leash they do have a very powerful sense of smell and get totally absorbed in following scent.|`|rLqo6ACkaa	yes beagles are very good dogs they are also good with kids and they dont get very big my aunt has 2 and they are loving dogs      here is a web sit that has some puppy beagles just click on available dogs and scroll down a little and you will see pictures of baby beagles for sale|`|8jhtjNGoaa	My mom had a beagle mix that was a rescue. All he wanted all the time was love, and boy did that make him easy for me to train, even as a teenager. The only problem you will run into - or at least that I did, is that until they're quite older, you can never, never, never trust them off the leash. Beagles are tracking dogs and they will follow their nose wherever it takes them. Including across streets, into other people's yards, or until they aren't quite sure where they've gotten themselves. I strongly suggest getting it micro-chipped. They are also prone to obesity - they will eat anything put in front of them. Make sure you talk to a vet about the appropriate amount to feed them. Although their greedy little tummies also help make it easier to train them. And even though they are a short haired breed - we always had stiff hair stuck in our furniture - not because there was a ton, it just wasn't especially flexible and was hard to get out of the porous fabrics. Check out akc.org - the american kennel club breed information - it's a great way to find out about any breed.
e49de377def7dc80a5baa53274275b3baa	you're definitely not overstocked  however, your tank is going through the nitrogen cycling process  meaning, good bacteria starts to grow on your filter pads, which is essential for the fish survival    do_not replace the filter pad, or you will stall the cycle process  it can take anywhere from 2-8 weeks to be fully cycled  the cloudiness shows that it's working and is absolutely normal    get yourself some test kits if you don't have them yet  for Ammonia, Nitrite and NitrAtes    at first you will see an ammonia Spike, which will be converted into Nitrites, which then will be converted into NitrAtes, which is the final product of the nitrogen cycle    here is an article for you to read up on how to do it properly with graphics  http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/...|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Your tank is not overcrowded, and I would actually add three more glass fish to make an even school.     Perform weekly water changes of 25% only. Anymore than 30% should be reserved for emergencies only.     It is also a good idea to vacuum gravel, and maintain the filter on separate days, so that you do not remove too much of the beneficial bacteria at one time.|`|tiABWrkeaa	No, you're not overcrowded, but you are doing a few things wrong. First, you don't need that large of a water change unless your ammonia, nitrites and nitrates are very high. A 4-6 gallon (10-20%) weekly water change is preferable. The foggy water is the bacterial bloom. When you set up your aquarium, bacteria will feed on the ammonia from fish waste and food to produce nitrite. Bacteria will feed on the nitrite and produce nitrate, which is all called the nitrogen cycle. However, you're causing this to start, stop and restart when you change the filter.     The bacteria will eventually live in the whole tank, but the important ones will live in the filter. Every time you change it, a new colony has to be established, causing the bloom to happen again. Now, you do have a solution in front of you, the plant. Buy several more plants and they will act as a filter (give them a few days to recover from the "shock" of replanting) until the bacterial/biological filter is established. Until then, don't replace the filter. When you do a water change, take out the filter and rinse it in the old aquarium water and put it back in. This way, you'll clean off any gunk, but keep the bacteria you need.  Also, if you need to prime your filter, use old aquarium water.|`|FdyAUukbaa	you are definintly not overcrowded.. those fish could live in a 20 gallon even a 15g
YFTZM86maa	males will fight each other, so you need to be educated on how to introduce them to each other.  Your pig may prefer an igloo or box type house to sleep in.  Toilet paper is not the best to use as it can be eaten and wad up in his guts.  Try making a little tent out of folded cardboard, or hang a bandanna size piece of cloth in a corner that he can crawl under.  He may be too hot to sleep in the log or anything else, so it's really not much to worry about.

bDPVRtCNaa	Your idea may work, but it would be difficult to maintain a certain temperature.    Betta tanks should be maintained between 77F-82F. Buy a thermometer to monitor temperature, and don't let it fluctuate.     These are mini aquarium heaters at a good price. If you don't want to order online, you can also find this heater at Petsmart.- http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	they have heaters for small tanks|`|rrKRbQcsaa	That may work, but if your tank is small and your home or room is realatively warm and comfortable for you your betta should be fine.  Only if your house or room is cold should you consider a heater.  They do sell small heaters with a simple dial that can help control the temperature-like a mini thermo stat. It keeps the water constant. Your heating pad may work but you'll have to moniter the temp more often|`|SY0cSoQuaa	Walmart has a Tetra heater for $13. Its 25w and it's preset to 78 degrees F. That could work for your small tank. Otherwise they also sell a "Jr.Aquatics" heater for $7 and it should be able to heat your 2 gallon tank. I've used it in 1 gallon plastic temporary tanks and it heated the water to 80 degrees steadily.|`|1864afb7ec8de04ddd4e5d40804f200baa	Bettas don't necessarily need a heater unless the room they are in is either drafty or cold. The heating pad might work. The water temp needs to be between 70 and 82 degrees (78-79 degrees is ideal) since they are a tropical fish. Maybe one of those thermometers that you stick on the outside of the tank might help in keeping the temp in the appropriate range. By the way, I am glad to see that you don't keep them confined to those horridly small containers they sell the bettas in. Some people do, but if you ask me that is animal cruelty.|`|AA11708471	Get a proper 5+ gallon tank with a 25-55 watt heaterstat

8jhtjNGoaa	Do you use cleaners or fertilizers where your dog walks? Pesticides, lawn fertilizers, wood, tile, or laminate cleaners can all irritate his feet. Some dogs just have itchy feet anyways - but if you have those products where he's walking and then he's licking them? He could be ingesting chemicals. If you are using products that aren't already, try getting versions that are green or pet-safe. Definitely take him to a vet as well, when one of my dogs was doing that it turned out she had cactus spurs in between her pads which had to be removed. If the vet says there's no allergies, and it's not toxins that he's walking on - ask your vet about using something like bitter apple to keep him from chewing. Some dogs chew as a nervous habit, the same way people chew their finger nails. There are so many possibilities, you should really have him checked out by a professional. Just in case.|`|Pk75T4GYaa	My dog scratches his ear and then licks his feet when his is is hurting him    Is there any ear scratching first?|`|64hKLGjpaa	i have a rottweiler  and he keeps licking his feat and the reason is simple he gets his leg hurt  .  so check of any sings of  limping or UN usual way of walking .if so take him to a vet .they will do the needy|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Here is what I KNOW about my dog's foot licking:    It is an INHALENT allergy  Most likely cats, dust (mites) or mold  They told me grass, but I think that was a scam to make them seem like it was MY fault...I kept her off of all grass...100% and nothing changed.     The problem is that the crap food we have been feeding them has had meat from animals with antibiotics...so our dogs get the antibiotics, it kills off the good bacteria, candida yeast grows in the GI tract, allergies result. And, if your vet gave antibiotics then it is really a problem.    Don't bother with allergy shots...giant waste of money    Try to avoid carpet...tile and hardwood are best.    Take your dog off normal dog food...replace with a grain-free dog food  Make sure there are no antibiotics fed to the animals in the food (chickens, cows, etc.)    The one I use is "Taste of the Wild"    Add Omega-3 oils and RAW meat at least twice per week (I am totally unable to feed Babette raw meat...so I sear the beef first...don't follow me, because it has nothing to do with the program...I am just the kind who gets nauseated easily.  There is a dog Omega 3 treat named: Synovi G3 Soft Chews  Or, just use the Omega3 oils in the pet store and put on food    Give your dog some probiotics...I give Babette unflavored Kefir. It replenishes the good bacteria killed by the antibiotics.    If it gets terrible gently massage some benedryl ointment on the itchy bumps on the paws (they are there...look hard) and then some tea tree oil...your dog will look at you like s/he wants to marry you.    Hey...good luck!  I is terrible seeing your dog suffer!!! I know!!!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Why do you doubt an allergic reaction. Most common reason is food allergy.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Paw licking is the most common first sign of Food/Environmental allergies...another possibility is OCD.|`|lavd3UHmaa	If your dog is older it could be arthritis.|`|H5NGXgqsaa	Our Maltese tends to do the same...I know he has multiple allergies though & one primarily being 'grass' of all things! We always have to wash his paws & apply aloe/anti-itch sprays to his paws...One dog groomer told me that applying Tinactin [athlete's foot spray/cream] is helpful because many dogs have a fungal type irritation...I was concerned about him licking such, she assured me that it will not harm them she has applied to dogs paws for over 20+years ...with no problem...  You need to determine IF your dog does this out of boredom-allergy-neurosis or any other reason before deciding which answers out here in YA truly may apply to your dog specifically. However, spraying or applying any type of aloe based ingredient will NOT harm your dog...so you could try that in the interim of deciding what indeed is the primary culprit...|`|26PPwzrWaa	Licking his feet is typically a sign of a food allergy.     As a preventative measure, switch to a grain free food.    www.dogfoodproject.com  www.dogfoodanalysis.com     If no go after 12 weeks, switch to grain free and different meat base, like wellness core ocean variety. Wait 12 weeks to see improvment or not.   In the mean time test for allergies at the vet.     Vets are not nutritionist.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Relieving the pain or cleaning are pretty common choices.

Either that or there is an anxiety related issue or some sort of sore on his or her paws. You said this is a constant issue so I would absolutely take him to the vet to get it checked out. Even if you doubt the dog has allergies, he could have developed one if there is any new allergen in his environment or if his food has changed.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	My dachshund did that and it was allergies. it also could be a sign of boredom, or worry. Why do you doubt its an allergy? Check to see if there's any redness between the toes or sores. Even an in-grown hair will cause him to lick.
QUkXsPNIaa	This is called tying and is a totally normal and natural part of breeding. it can be distressing for someone who doesn't know what they're seeing.    The cold water advise is an old myth; they will sperate when the male is finished ejaculation (can take up to an hour or more, usually 20 mins)    Just let them be, that's just how dogs do it.    Nikko: I wasn't aware I had asked you anything? So why are you "answering" to me? If I did have a question, I would ask on my lecturers, or one of the Vet's in my placement practice.|`|8RrNrjFPaa	yes, this natural event called tying, occurs to ensure that no other male dogs can impregnate the female.

Could you add that information?|`|7lsU5bcoaa	Here's what I'd do:  General Knowledge  - Different coat colors  -Breeds  - difference between horses and ponies    Basic Horse Care:  Grooming - all the brushes  Feeding - what horses eat  Safety around horses - don't stand behind the horse, wear a helmet etc etc.    Equipment:  Saddle - maybe show them pictures of an english + a western saddle  Bridle - show them pictures of a headstall + an english bridle - explain basic function  Halter - mention the difference between halter and bridle  Saddle pad - all you really need to do is show a picture and say that it goes under the saddle  Lead rope - This could be lumped in with halter    Horse sports  Describe english and western, this can go before tack maybe, or with it ??  maybe go into more detail i.e. jumping etc  maybe mention race horses    hope i helped, good luck!|`|pR4JVtSJaa	Why are you giving the presentation?  You could talk about where kids might see horses today - being ridden by policemen, pulling carriages in the park, parades, and so on.  Or talk about what kids their age do with horses - barrels, jumping, dressage (I call it "dancing" for those who don't know what dressage is), playing in the creek, etc.|`|8cikAYp3aa	A small bit of history, how small the dawn horse Eohippus was verse a modern horse. how horses changed mans way of life.|`|yDgYSHvaaa	-Food/water (trivia, like how many gallons they drink per day and all they eat... maybe bring in some grain. I teach a summer riding camp for children and when I talk about grain, I give them some and tell them to taste it if they want to. It's always fun watching their faces when they realize it tastes like cardboard. Then explain that grain is like cookies or brownies for horses.).  -The difference between western and English  -Basic bits: Tom's Thumb, snaffle, curb  -Breeds and what events those breeds are typically used for (like warmbloods are typically used for dressage and jumping, etc.)  -Colors (lchestnut/sorrel, palomino, roan, grulla, bay, etc.)  -Basic equine body parts (barrel, poll, dock, hock, hoof, etc.)  -Shoeing a horse. Talk about how not all horses wear shoes, how some horses only have front shoes, the (basic) shoeing process, explain what a farrier is...  Get creative, have fun. If they're younger kids, do lots of interactive things. When I do summer camps, we have a giant stuffed horse and a ton of different anatomy parts on cards with Velcro on the back. We have the kids stick the body parts on the stuffed horse and then correct their answers. You could do this with a poster or individual sheets of paper with a horse on them, as well.|`|2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	A fascinating topic would be the nature of horses (as prey animals), their behavior (pecking order, herd behavior, why they spook so easily, etc.), safety tips when around horses, and how best to communicate with horses based on their nature.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Grooming  Show clothes  Safety around horses  The importance of healmets   breeds  Parts of the saddles|`|ZNhOY24naa	-Colours  -History of the horse   -Grooming  -Tack  -Riding  -Competitions  -Breeds and heights|`|BQHbEwE8aa	Oh what a fantastic topic!    It all depends though on what you want to focus on.     I think 'horse behaviour' is one of the most important areas to cover. If you understand how horses think and act, then I believe that is the foundation for being able to be around horses.      Wikipedia has some great general information about the horse.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse    You could take sections of that website and present it.    Good Luck - sounds like fun!|`|yQFdBj3haa	- Safety when around horses (not to walk behind, always wear a helmet, etc)  - General care of a horse (mucking out, grooming, riding, etc)  - Different sports involving horses (racing, jumping)  - Feeding a horse (how to feed a horse, what to feed a horse)  - Brief history of horses (horses used for farming, before cars existed)  - Genders of horses (colt, filly, stallion, gelding, mare)  - Famous horses we've seen.|`|mKWwz1uUaa	When I gave these to kids one thing that made them laugh was I asked them do they brush there teeth twice a day and floss?  They said yes, or no but either way I would say good or well if you don't this is what they will look like if you don't and open the horses mouth to show them the teeth, they would all say EEEEWWWWW and I'm gonna brush from know on for sure:)  This is one way to keep them interested, of course if you can't get a real horse print some pics off line to show them:)  Also ask them is a horse can burp!!!  They can't have fun with it, and in between through in other information, what age children are they?  One other thing is we used Belgians for show, and show them just how BIG the hoofs were, and much bigger than there own heads, you can print off a accurate size and show them.Best of luck and just have fun.    WOWOWOWOWOW Thumbs down for helping kids have fun with this!!!!!!  Hum Okay then....lol|`|bYPfFCr4aa	from u mouth...dnt know how to   okey fine i dnt know|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Depends on your goal - how old are you, what is the purpose of the presentation?  share this with us to help you build something useful.  then we can come back and share more ideas.    You see- to a non-horse person, talking about horse nature could be very interesting, depending on the age range.  talking about different breeds and colors could take a long time but be interesting too.    What is the time frame you must cover?  15 minutes, 5 minutes, a half hour?    I think to young children who are unfamiliar with horses, perhaps some facts about famous horses might be fun and interesting.  Or what about "Did you know" type of things - what are some really interesting things you know about horses?  Also, what's your age and experience level?|`|ADjeuxIiaa	- The foods they eat (include snacks!)  - The things horses wear (dont forget that winter coat, they get cold too!)  - Vet. Horses get check ups too!   - Sizes  - Jobs. Ex: Police horses, cattle horses, carriage horses, etc.  - Stalls/Pastures  - Cleaning (how to and why its important)    Just make sure it's kid friendly and they can find ways to relate a horse to something they may understand better like people or dogs.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	You can cover a lot of different topics! Start out with the prehistory of the horse, (how they started out dog size in North America but disappeared until brought back by the Spanish). Give a little rundown on how important they were to creating civilizations around the world in warfare, farming ,travel,even medicine. Tell a story about famous horses such as Bucephales.  Most kids today just think "cowboy" when you mention a horse. They have no idea how dependent we were upon them.  Then go into the modern age and how we use the horse today,sports and leisure mostly in America. Tell them why horses react the way they do,(prey animal instincts and vision) and how horses have different personalities which make them suitable for different jobs. I would touch lightly on feed, care and shoeing. Stress what's important without too much detail. You can do a little how and why on riding, how a bit works, why you keep your heels down.And give them  question and answer time. That's where it gets fun! Bring a few props like a saddle, pictures and stuff they can handle and guess at (bit, hoof pic,curry,wormer)|`|z3Ae5s1xaa	Depending on the age group, I would stick to very basic topics like colors of horses, basic horse breed (Quarter Horses, Thoroughbreds, Arabians, etc.), some basic horse anatomy, and horse care.  This sounds like a fun presentation!|`|NJdupXBKaa	I think allot of non horse people don't fully understand what horse riding takes as a sport and as a way of life. If you made a presentation on this and made it really passionate. It might really inspire some people.  If you look on Youtube there are some really great videos that people have made. Type in what it takes, horseriding. Or something.  You could talk about the diffrent sports. Showjumping. Dressage. Cross Country. Racing. Barrel Racing. Showing.   There Are So Many.  Also it would be good to show what kind of care is needed around horses.  Like stable work. Mucking out. The importance of feed ect.  Aslong as you keep it intresting :)    Good luck. Hope it goes well. :)    xxx    I think this is a really good video... Its not made by me i just saw it   http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=-_ib5t27TS...
ADjeuxIiaa	There are pros and cons to owning any animal. Horses are no different.    Pros:  Loving companion.  They can live 30 years! Time to build a great bond.  You can ride them.  With training, you can show them and earn money. (investment!)  A new release for stress. (riding always calms me down)  Expand your topic knowledge  You can join horse specific groups  They are habitual learners.  (They'll even eat those yucky veggies you tried to slip to the dog)    Cons:  They require equine vets which are particularly expensive.  They eat a LOT of food.  Must get new shoes on a regular basis.  Stalls need to be cleaned daily to prevent thrush.  Requires extensive time and patience to train  If untrained, they can be dangerous  You must ride them often or they could potentially go "green" and could throw you off.  They can live 30 years, so a horse is a HUGE commitment!|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Pros:  When we learn to interact properly with horses, we learn to consider the needs and nature of another being, this makes us more able to consider the personality styles and drivers of other people - I think successfully interacting with horses at a high level allows further success in many areas of life.  - The ability to get away and not think - I love to daydream while cleaning stalls - it's my time to reflect, set goals and see if I like where I am at in life.  - Learning responsibility.  I've had horses my whole life.  I'm now nearly 42.  I do my chores in the morning at 6 am before work and I do them when I get home before I eat my dinner at 6 pm.  People at work think I'm nuts to do that out in the cold winter - to me, I couldn't live without it.  I know it's taught me a lot about responsibility - all the animals get their breakfast and dinner 7 days a week before I do.    cons -  Mainly cost   - and the fear of loss of control of them - I take very good care of my horses, they're the closest thing to children I'll ever have.  The thought of ever having the sell them or find them other homes is very painful.  Should I lose my job or become disabled, it would break my heart to have to find them other homes and never know they were cared for as well as I would care for them.|`|NJdupXBKaa	Pros: Way to many to say but here's some;    - Loving Companion  - Great sport  - Galloping and Jumping are so amazing you feel like your flying  - Lifes never boring  - You always know your horse will be there.   - They are just truley amazing.    Cons:     - They cost soooooo much to keep.  - Its devestating to loose one.  - Sometimes you have to sell on.  - It can be really dangerous.    -HIGHLY ADDICTIVE :P    xxx|`|LiOOF1Plaa	High expense. If you are made of money....its a good hobby to waste money on. Also, one fall from a horse....consider your hobby OVER|`|87naw1BOaa	Pros:    If its big enough you can ride it.  You can love it.  You can tell people you have a horse.  Ect.    Cons:   You have to clean up after it.  You have to clean it.  They cost a lot of money to have.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Horses create endorphins in the brain and function similarly to drugs involved in an addiction. Much like dogs, cats, bunny rabbits, newborn babies, or other animals that you can care for and love and receive some feedback that they love you back... perhaps like a boyfriend, or a spouse... when the marriage is new.    If you are a "Horseperson" owning a horse is not something that you have a choice about. You will own a horse. People will give you their horses and soon you will own more than one horse. You will not complain, and you will totally re-arrange your life to make it work for your horses. Your life will change in ways you never expected, and other people, non "Horse-people" may remark that you should "Get rid of that horse." or do something different with your time and your money.    A horseperson will not listen to what non-horsepeople say about their horse/horses, and soon will get rid of the non-horsepeople who complain about their horses from their life, and find their circle of friends has grown, (or shrunk) to include other horsepeople who also did not listen to the non-horsepeople and also weeded out the non-horsepeople who complained.   If you like horsepeople, this is a Pro for horseownership.   If you don't like horsepeople, this is a Con.     Cons: Trainers - get a good book (or several) and read it, read the magazines related to your horse riding and training discipline. Trainers are often manipulators who can't do anything else and take advantage of new horse owners. Don't let this happen to you. Learn everything you can through reading and watching really grounded and gentle horsepeople and then apply what you learn to your own horse. Having a good articulate and patient riding instructor is a good idea... but a horse trainer, someone who trains your horse but doesn't train you... is not as good.    Cons: Too much tack... tack buying can become a secondary addiction, don't let this happen to you. Keep it simple. Buy only what you need. Don't buy duplicates and then multiples.    Cons: Appropriate feed, water, sunlight, turn out, and consistency in all things on a daily basis -- if you can't supply these things... especially consistency on a daily basis... don't own a horse. Your horse will quickly become a chaotic system requiring long nights, vet bills, your heart jumping into your throat, you bank account emptied... Consistency of care, feeding and handling is necessary.    Pros: Excitement. Adrenalin (after a run or good competition) Horses smell good (especially after a bath and a brushing.) Positive endorphin production. Relaxation, recreation... imagination, inspiration, exercise, fresh air, peaceful friendship, having a buddy is good. And Love is ALWAYS good.... even the giant, dangerous, expensive, confounding four legged kind!|`|iz03uvV4aa	Pros = EVERYTHING. Too much to list literally.  Cons = They are expensive. But...theyre worth it :)|`|6GehblM3aa	Pros:    - You can ride him/her whenever you want.  When you have your own horse, you don't need to schedule all the time, or worry you'll be late.    - Having your own allows you to bond with him/her.    - They teach you lots of lessons, like responsibility, money management, and planning your time wisely.    - They are TONS of fun!    Cons:    - MONEY!!!  Horses are not like owning a dog or cat, they cost thousands and thousands of dollars.  There are vet bills, farrier bills, boarding fees, etc.  Horse people will probably end up spending more on their horse(s) than they ever will on themselves.    - Time.  You don't simply walk a horse for 5 minutes and you are done for the day...you need about 2+ hours a day exercising and caring for your horse (this not including feeding, mucking stalls, etc.).    - Commitment.  You can't buy a horse and suddenly decide you don't want him/her anymore.  It's not as simple as that.  They don't simply stop living while your not there.    Though there are many "cons" to owning a horse, they are still the most wonderful animals, companions, and partners ever.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Pros:  1. It is your horse, nobody can take it away from you  2. You can ride whenever you please  3. The care is in your hands so you can make sure they get the optimum in care  4. The one of a kind bond!    Cons  1. Price   2. Vet bills  3. Tough decisions like putting down  4. Dealing with boarding stables  5. Horse insurance|`|Aa5uoc7daa	http://www.hudsonvalleyhorses.com/articl...

Her problems might be helped with a simple pill for her pain, and he could tell you why she is loosing weight|`|vRG0ebayaa	awhhhh :( thats sad. play with her more and spend more time one on one just you two. treasure everything and take pictures of her. i'm sorry to hear that about her.|`|AA12128656	no. she's just old and grouchy.  spend some time with her away from the other little whippersnappers.    try to get her to eat alone without other dogs around before you call the vet. she may be confused and then they are eating her food.    if she doesn't eat, call the vet.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	First of all I have labs my oldest is 12 I would take her to the vet immediately if she's not eating, get a blood sample run to make sure all her levels are good.  My lab still likes to play a little bit but he sleeps alot also he's still very attentive to.  I would seriously take her to the vet and see what they think though.  That's just what I would do.|`|wuBIF9aPaa	11 is still pretty young (meaning she has a few more years left for sure), but it sounds like she might be sick, why don't you take the dog to the vet?|`|A9q3h6Lyaa	i thought my 13 yr old dog was dying a few months ago. she stopped eating and would lie very still and not respond to my voice or touch. other times she would shiver uncontrollably. i booked an appt with the vet but the day before the appt she snapped out of it and has been perfect ever since. she's eating perfectly and has that same spring in her step. i have no idea what happened and i don't want to take her to the vet now, because i'm afraid they will run all kinds of unnecessary, expensive tests and won't find anything anyway.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	You need to get her to a Vet and get checked out.  Have some bloodwork done to see what's going on.  As for the up and down stairs, it's probably arthritis which can be treated with medication.  The typical lifespan for a Lab is around 12-13 so you have a senior dog that needs special care and attention.  My oldest dog will be 14 April 1st and I have bloodwork done on him every 6 months to check for any changes.  I know that isn't something everyone chooses to do, but bloodwork at least once a year for a senior dog is a great idea to be able to detect health changes in your dog before they get serious.|`|AA11179899	Get the poor dog to the vets ~~loosing weight ~~a sure sign of cancer.Do it!

OxFsslN8aa	Grooming instruments are often a source of fear/anxiety for many dogs.  I would turn on the clippers & leave them by him while you give treats & praise.  You need to condition your dog to the strange sounds & feelings that come with grooming.  It doesn't have anything to do with trusting you, it comes with his understanding of those instruments.|`|64hKLGjpaa	give him a treat before and after  the grooming is over  .just imagine ur self in his place some one gnomes u for a log time how would u feal .it is natural for him to be pissed of  siting in a place for long time  so keep it snappy . and r ember to appreciate him  he will love it bye take care|`|AA11179899	Why go through all the trouble ~~take the dog to a professional groomer.

Take her to a groomer. We know how to handle her to keep her calm and not stressed.    add:  Wow aren't you a nice person, don't ask the question if you don't want to know the answers.

6nCtEw7Taa	i would say not to get a nest box because that encourages breeding behavior and the female is to young she might attack her offspring and or her mate but in a say 4-5 months is a good time frame so that she is old enough and these problems wont be such a worry but me personally im only 13 (i just know a lott about bird's) but i don't have that kind of patience so i would just breed them but for someone older and that has that type of patience i would go do the few month wait  i hoped i helped you    P.S i have a breeding pair of cockatiel's right now (a male luntio and a female pied)
XI2iylR4aa	No corn, rabbits cannot digest it, and it can cause an impaction, which can make them VERY sick.    I don't know if the rabbits you're getting are adults, but adult rabbits should eat a diet mainly consisting of timothy (grass) hay, fresh leafy vegetables (NO iceberg lettuce!!), and a small amount of pellets daily.  Carrots should be considered treats, and should be fed sparingly.  I know a lot of people feed their buns a ton of carrots when they first get them, only to find out later that they're too sweet to feed in quantity.      Check out http://www.rabbit.org for a more detailed diet.  Good luck with your buns, and keep the corn away.|`|HwxBL1B1aa	yah they can   any vege|`|t6UkxbBNaa	NO NO NO NO NO!!! Rabbits cannot have Corn or Cabbage!!! There has been MANY rabbits have died from contaminated feed (KENT had an outbreak in 2007) that has corn in it. Go to your local pet store or a Tractor Supply, I feed MANA-PRO ALL RABBITS but you can feed PURINA or COUNTRY LANE. Also NEVER EVER feed a rabbit Cabbage, it's highly lethal like corn. Feed your new bunz one half of a cup of feed per pound of body weight per day, With some treats like carrots, timothy hay(NO alfalfa), straw, lettuce, etc. If you have any other questions e-mail me at haretastic@aol.com|`|CdPWH4vcaa	Ask your neighbors. Im sure they can tell you. I'd just get them rabbit food though.|`|wKo5P7ueaa	hmm..    most likely|`|nmercOm7aa	Corn is not good for rabbits. They cannot digest it and it can cause a blockage.   The majority of their diet should be timothy hay (or other grass hay). Pellets should be limited to about 1/4 cup for every 5lbs or body weight. You can give veggies, but introduce slowly (one at a time) to avoid problems. Some good ones are lettuce, parsley and other herbs.|`|pcLHKXeXaa	I breed & raise rabbits and one bit of info I always tell people who want a "pet" rabbit with no prior info is that you can give it some veggies as treats and such, but please know their main diet really needs to be a bought rabbit food. Many people think giving them carrots & lettuce will do just fine, but there is a lot of nutrition that they need and can't get from that!!! Good luck with them!!!!!|`|k2vvT6glaa	NO! It's too starchy for them. They also can't eat potato, lettuce, cabbage (in large quantities) and that's pretty much it for vegetables. Just buy some rabbit pellets and hay, and give them some chinese vegetables and carrots. They also love apple and some love bread (don't give them too much!)
5PsKGss7aa	Best you can do is to phone your animal control as soon as you can & tell them whats going on.<br>  Do NOT visit them as another user posted,you will alert him if he is a Puppy mill and he will hide, so just call up animal control.|`|bIaywrBCaa	you are correct. he is a Puppy miller. Call the humane society and report them.|`|UmhWxs1laa	If you can see the puppies playing outside the shed, it sounds like he is giving proper exercise.  You don't mention dirt, smell, nor lack of food or water.  <br>  <br>  Bad puppy millers never let the dogs out -- sounds like these dogs do get exercise.  <br>  <br>  Breeding dogs is not a crime, nor should it be.  Naturally, dogs should be bred responsibly and I don't like designer breeds, but it is not illegal.<br>  <br>  Unless you can document poor conditions, I suggest perhaps you go over and volunteer to help out with the dogs and perhaps learn a little.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	if he has a license to breed from the USDA, all millers do, as it means nothing, it's legal <br>  <br>  but even if he is not doing anything illegal the dogs have to be in bad shape for anything to be done<br>  <br>  i wouldn't visit him or talk to him as then he will know it was you who called and could seek revenge on you plus  you will give him reason to clean up his act or worse yet get rid of all the dogs - to another miller<br>  <br>  call your local animal control or spca or whoever and tell them what's going on|`|JmD0oq2Naa	phone animal control. they will take the dogs and find them decent homes.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Visit you neighbour first, before calling help|`|AA10049109	Depending upon where you live, there may be nothing you can do.  In my state, as long as there is food, water, and shelter, there is no violation. It doesn't matter if the dog is sitting in a cage too small for it.  The only thing they will cite for is filth, lack of food water, or shelter or obvious injuries or illness/dead animals that weren't given medical attention.  Health department might be more useful in cases like these. If you can show there is excess feces, urine and smell that pose a health risk, they will cite them for that.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	The final is right, the dogs would have to be in bad shape in order for the authorities to do anything, As long as he exercises them, feeds them and they look healthy, has water for them, and brushes them out so their coats are knot free, he's really not doing anything wrong.<br>    But if the dogs look unhealthy then you can contact authorities and have something done about it.|`|RDcwT7YEaa	Call Animal Control and the Police the Police will normally respond quicker and they will also get Animal Control there sooner.|`|AA11244754	Call animal control, no dog deserves that kind of life.|`|tFKQYT6Naa	YOU NEED TO CALL THE ASPCA IMMEADIATLY AND LET THEM KNOW BEFORE UR NEIGHBOR SELLS THEM TO SOMEONE

Did you cycle your tank before putting your fish in there? That could be a major cause of the problems. It could also be the type of goldfish your getting, are they good quality and from a reputable dealer or are they feeders from the local Wal-Mart.<br>  If they are from a good source then look at the water quality first and foremost, because even if your feeding tropical flakes to a goldfish this should still give it enough food to live quite comfortably on. And Prince so you know a fish, regardless of species, can live 2 weeks without food with NO dire consequences. This is of course providing the fish is healthy to begin with. <br>  Curiosity begs this question though, how often are you cleaning your tank, you don't say in the question.

32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	sorry to tell you that first you should roll back the carpet and clean and air the floor, if this doesn't do it then get new carpet.<br>  <br>  if you are patient, after cleaning both the carpet, the padding and the floor under sometimes it just needs some time to air out which can take a few weeks<br>  <br>  make sure that everything is perfectly dry  and aired before you roll the padding and carpet back down<br>  <br>  if this was one pee it shouldn't be a big deal but if this is multiple pees then you've got problems<br>  also should you have to replace the carpet you may find it cheaper and better to put down flooring, as then when it happens again you can wipe up and be done, if you can do this yourself or have a family member do it, it won't be much as compared to new carpeting|`|DTlFaJkaaa	your last response is the winner... sadly.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	If the dog's been using the carpet for a while the urine may have soaked down into the padding and even to the sub-flooring below.  If this has occurred you'll have to take up the carpet, padding, and have the sub-flooring treated with an enzyme product before installing new carpet and padding.  <br>  <br>  But, before going to that expense, I would have a professional carpet cleaning service in to clean the carpet. Just make sure you tell them about the pet odor problem.  If a professional cleaning does not work, then you'll have to replace it.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	I bought a great product called "Folex." It actually worked. Pour a bit on the stain, work it in and it actually removed the stain, no ring, pleasant smell. My cat had this habit too.|`|AA11244754	you should try Nature's Miracle it's at PetSmart and Petco.  You should've tried it before you did all that cleaning, that won't remove the enzyme that has the order for urine in it.|`|24CFl7sjaa	the urine may have soaked the floor underneath, so you would need to lift the carpet and thoroughly clean under or the smell will just keep coming back through.|`|RDcwT7YEaa	You will definitely need new carpet. Be sure the padding you get will block any odors in the flooring beneath it because once the scent is there they will return to it.

But nothing is breed-specific.
mvrygTYTaa	A broken tail can not be repaired. They will probably remove it. Depending on how much you want cropped. You can ask for all of it to be removed or just until where it was broken. Either way, please have it removed or take the cat to a no-kill shelter who can afford to do so and find it a home.<br>  <br>  My cat's mother was hit by a car and she was born with her tail broken. She now has about a 2 inch tail and she's perfectly fine without her tail. She's been my little buddy since 2000 and is healthy and happy.|`|bxlYleZkaa	The limp part of the tail will die and, if not removed by a vet, may turn infectious.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Please take your kitten in to the vet's and have them examine the tail.  Its easy to get an abcess at the site of the injury.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	You must take her to a vet.  If her tail is broken it will probably need to be amputated as, if it is not, she will either start self-mutilating it because of the pain or she will keep getting it caught in things because of the loss of feeling due to nerve damage.<br>  <br>  Vet now.|`|4aAhEK9daa	It will probably have to be amputated where it's broken.  Get it to the vet NOW - don't wait till morning.  <br>  <br>  I find it odd she's playing with it as this must be very playful.  Which leads me to believe this is yet another BS troll post.

It may just get better and be fine, but if its broken several different things could happen. She may get a little lump in her tail that will stay there for ever but use the tail normally. She may have the same lump and her tail will stay down, not quite dragging it along the floor just not all high, but she will be able to wiggle it. She will be able to jump and do normal cat things.<br>  If the skin is broken or anything like that or she goes into shock you must take her to a vet immediately. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Littlemissflying
R93qp2Zxaa	bowel infections are part of the digestive system, so I'd say throwing up after medicine to fix it would be fairly normal.  The waste needs to come out somehow and if its having trouble coming out the end (hence the spot he made you feel), it makes sense that they might throw up in the meantime.<br>  Watery eyes are fairly normal when ill or tired.<br>  <br>  If the vet didn't specifically say "they shouldn't ____" throw up or whatever, I'd say you're lil buddies ok just keep an eye on them.<br>  <br>  Though cats like privacy when they're ill.

That is perfectly normal and acceptable behavior...for a day or two...|`|bxlYleZkaa	Not sure what you mean by "drolled" but the other symptoms could be of a feline form of gastric flu.
PJoGxHThaa	Sounds like he is really annoying you!      ~Reasons he might be tapping on your window:    1.  He sees his reflection and is trying to make the "other" bird leave his territory.    2.  He might think he can fly through the window, and maybe he is just so determined he won't give up.    3.  It is also a possibility that he sees something in your house (like a tree or any plant perhaps) and wants to fly to it.      ~Here some ways you can fix this:    Decrease the reflectivity of your windows:       1. Pull down your shades: white curtains or blinds can make it difficult for birds to see their reflections.       2. Put the screens in operable windows to make them less reflective.       3. Consider soaping your windows for a couple of weeks during the nesting season.       4. Break up the reflection by hanging something, placing decorative window films, or using 1-inch-wide tape or ribbon to create vertical stripes every four inches on the outside of your windows.       5. Move houseplants away from the glass and close curtains over windows and sliding glass doors whenever possible.     Create a physical barrier:       1. Build a net frame to act as a barricade by mounting fine-mesh netting (available at garden centers or hardware stores) in a rigid frame, using shelf brackets to hold the frame a couple of inches away from the window.       2. Install indoor-outdoor blinds on the outside of your windows.       3. Adhesive-backed cut-out silhouettes of hawks or falcons in flight to attach to the outer surfaces of reflective glass are sold in virtually all stores catering to naturalists and birders.  (I believe you tried this already but i figured i might as well suggest it.  And make sure your putting them on the OUTSIDE of the window!)          In fact, any shape will work. The non-reflective cutout attracts the birds attention making it not notice the window is see-through and want to go through, knowing it's there, avoid it.       4. If you're a bird watcher and feed birds, consider moving your feeders further away from windows.    I hope that helps!|`|rQlzfHqraa	A silhouette of a crow/blackbird may not be enough. Perhaps a good silhouette of a bird eating hawk will do.|`|bYPfFCr4aa	kill her/him|`|XavY3fiWaa	maybe he see something through the window he wants so he's trying to get in, try covering up your window, i don't know if that will work but its might.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Cardinals are wonderful birds and it saddens be to say that you hope he dies. I know it gets on  your nerves but wishing something dead? Shameful. Put some decals up or pull curtains so the bird cannot see his reflection as it is fighting itself for territory. Thinks it is another male bird. Or simple put up a few tin pie pans in area or a motion detector owl that will scare the bird away.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Try this website:  http://www.wild-bird-watching.com/Cardin...  A bird would have no reason to fear a crow...try some of the tips listed in the website.|`|qbP5uAuJaa	If you have any other trees at all, get some high quality bird food and hang it on a tree close to the window. maybe he'll go for the food instead of the window. Also pulling curtains over the window, so the bird won't bother trying to get into your house.|`|ZXtij28paa	He's thinks the bird in the window (his reflection) is another Male Northern Cardinal and wants to protect his territory. To prevent him from doing this:    1. If you have a bird feeder near the window. move it.  2. If you don't have a feeder near the window and he's doing it, put an old bed sheet in front of the window OUTSIDE. So he doesn't see his reflection.  3. If he still hits the window. He's crazy or probably thinks it's fun. :)|`|eaa60d2e257b97556297c44e1f475936aa	I would say to pull your curtains shut on the window.

EJpiaCMQaa	Your budgie is molting, which is the same thing as loosing its feathers.  This is a normal process in budgies and all pet birds.  Budgies usually molt 2 to 3 times a year.  The entire molting process usually last for several weeks.  During this time, old feathers fall out, and are replaced by new or "pin feathers."  These pin feathers look spiky, so don't be worried about their appearance.  They start out spiky but eventually look like normal feathers.  Molting can be a stressful time for your budgie.  Some budgies sleep more, get irritable, and can scratch themselves or rub their heads against a perch or toys for relief from the itching.  Help your budgie through this stressful time by feeding it a well-balanced diet and misting it frequently.  Misting your budgie will encourage it to preen the feathers, and can reduce the irritation.  If for some reason the budgie's feathers don't all come in or it has many bald spots after several weeks, then you would need to take your budgie to a vet to see why it's not molting normally.  Most budgies don't have an abnormal molt, so don't be scared.|`|tkVCjeqmaa	It could be stressed

Bw18seFqaa	Primates do not make good pets.<br>  <br>  For one, they can be aggressive..  you cannot "train it out of them".. its part of their social structure and how they communicate.  Primate owners often get bite, scratched, pinched, slapped, etc..  Im not suprised the chimp attacked its owner.  Chimps are strong enough to break an adult's arm.<br>  <br>  They can carry nasty diseases, including hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, herpes, etc.<br>  <br>  They cannot be housebroken..  you cant expect them to keep a diaper on.  Primates also do disgusting behavoiurs like throwing food and poop, masturbating, drinking their own urine, etc.<br>  <br>  They need mental stimulation, constantly.  Otherwise a bored primate becomes very destructive.<br>  <br>  They are expensive to take care of.  You will need an exotics licence to own one.. and many areas outlaw primates period.  They need special vet care.. a zoonotic vet is not easy or cheap to come by.  They also have special diets.. its not all bannanas!<br>  <br>  <br>  They are not like having a child.  Primates are constant care and supervision.  They can easily live up to 30-40 + years.  Once you commit to owning a primate you are its caregiver for life.  They wont adapt to a new owner, not even an experienced primate owner.  You pretty much cant plan any vacations or weekend trips because your primate relies on you to care for it.  And zoos do not ussually take unwanted pets.. they often lack the proper social skills to introduce them to other primates.|`|en65MKIMaa	Noooo! Chimps grow to be the same size as a person but they will be much stronger than the average man. They may seem cute when they are young, but they can be dangerous when they are adults. Some chimps have been known to attempt to rape women. They are too dangerous to be part of our society.|`|k56mmj2eaa	I would think so. they are just like little kids. you get to change diapers on them at least 3 or 4 times a day. they are supposed to be smart. but last week in the news the lady that had the chimp had to have it killed because it attacked a friend of hers,|`|a37f465fb3af30fb69356b87ea42c178aa	Read the news lately?<br>  <br>  Lets see a chimp ripped off a ladies face the other day... yeh I'd say they make good pets.|`|o74xFiyyaa	It would be kwl but i wouldn't advise it. but if you want to have a per chimp sleep with them in the zoo because if you slept with them in the wild they won't be as tamed|`|4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	No. They do not.|`|0e51HkpHaa	yes, but only if they are a stuffed toy|`|CpUJI8adaa	hell no, do you watch the news this chimp attacked it owner and had to be put to death . they belong in the wild were they were born. they dont have the freedom they NEED to be normal chimps they are taken out of their natural environment which is not fare and force to be pets and entertainment for our pleasure. and locked up in a zoo ,which i think is totally cruel. i think they belong in the wild were they belong. thats where they are happy. like jane goodall says they need not be taken from their natural habitat.
AHEFXgE7aa	Sounds like it is dying.  They are pretty hard to keep.  But in excellent water conditions, it's pretty cool.  It pollutes the tank quickly when it dies, so keep a watch on it and pull it out once you know for sure it is dying.  Clownfish usually enjoy and take care of the anemones, but again, it is often short lived because the anemones keep dying.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|JvTF7UrMaa	sounds to me as though its dieing, although it may just come back, like fish get sick and survive, it may be sick and be fine again soon.<br>  <br>  hope it gets better lots of love zack x x x
M06c7GU6aa	Guinea pigs are very intelligent animals. Every morning they wake us up so we can feed them their veggies and fill up their bowls around the same time. That's why everytime they hear a bag rustle or the fridge open, they go nuts, because they remember those sounds coinside with them getting fed.<br>  <br>  I've trained my piggy to "do-a-circle", and he learned it less than 10 minutes, and hasn't forgot about it, and it's been over a year now.<br>  <br>  People really under estimate the intelligence of these little guys!|`|uvU5DnHcaa	That's is certainly not true.<br>  I have done a lot of tricks with my pigs over the past 7 yrs regarding memory. One thing is they don't forget a routine. If you have a routine and break it they stress very easily. So if they can remember a certain time every day that they get their memory is just as good as ours.<br>  <br>  Another test was I gave a blue water bottle to a young bub when weened and never changed her color of the bottle for 4 months. Then I put a red one and a green one in her cage and she would only drink from the blue one. Even when the blue one was empty she still would not drink from the other 2 full bottles, she waited till I filled up the blue bottle again before she would drink. <br>  <br>  They are smart and have very good memories.
wMeQoXkzaa	I like them both. Be sure to get them neutered so they don't spray urine and try to get out of the house looking for girl cats. Keep them indoors and safe from fleas, ticks, cars, dogs and keep them away from recliner chairs ( a friend accidentally killed their kitten when it was under his chair and he sat up).<br>  <br>   Getting them neutered will help keep them from making more kittens that there are not enough homes for. Too many get killed in shelters every year because they don't have homes.|`|GU7hENwJaa	Yeah those are great! but if u want, heres a few more suggestions:Skye<br>  Cloudy<br>  Fuzzy<br>  Fluffy<br>  Fluffiluffagus<br>  Bernie<br>  Binky<br>  Edward<br>  Gilbert<br>  Snickers<br>  Ted<br>  Mickey<br>  Buddy<br>  Beau<br>  Bella<br>  Remmie<br>  Dean<br>  Roxie<br>  Harry<br>  Nick<br>  James<br>  Sophie<br>  Elle<br>  Luna<br>  Ron<br>  Neville <br>  Ginny<br>  Snuffles<br>  Cookie<br>  Biscuit<br>  Ty<br>  Maggie<br>  Joe<br>  Eli<br>  Whimsy<br>  Sydney<br>  Mr. Wiggles<br>  Mrs. Norris<br>  Crookshanks<br>  Scabbers<br>  Hedwig<br>  Pigwidgeon<br>  Hermes<br>  Errol<br>  Willy<br>  Trevor<br>  Queenie<br>  Dakota<br>  Jennifer<br>  Alicia<br>  Sophie<br>  Katy<br>  Woofie<br>  Padfoot<br>  Prongs<br>  Wormtail<br>  Moony<br>  Munchie<br>  Chewie<br>  Popcorn<br>  Apple<br>  Caramel<br>  Cinnamon<br>  Maxie<br>  Callie<br>  Kelly<br>  Sneakers<br>  French Fry<br>  Cookie<br>  Oreo<br>  Major<br>  Streudel<br>  George<br>  Daisy<br>  Rose<br>  Lily<br>  Petunia<br>  Sunflower|`|8odsl9NIaa	coopers really cute, when i hear the name mikey - i think its like a little boy name..<br>  what about cooper and rascal?<br>  (:|`|jinyM8fyaa	Cooper is a goodn.<br>  How bout Mooch. :)|`|6417e8e713a4aa802f565ee9e9d75578aa	they are wonderfull and cooper is better for a black kitty while Mikey for a white one|`|aKkDWz5Waa	yes, real cute! especially Cooper :)|`|tXT63mFtaa	Aww yeah thats cutee.<br>  <br>  What kind are you getting ?<br>  <br>  Good luck with your soon-to-be kittens xD<br>  <br>  Abby <br>  x

AA11390428	No, monkey can not be trained to guiding as dog does.  As I think dog is faithful, but monkey is teasing.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I wouldnt think a monkey would make a good guide for the blind..  being a smaller animal, it would be harder for them to guide the blind person..  generally medium-large dogs are better for this task..  although I've heard of mini ponies being used also.   Dogs are much cheaper to obtain, easier to train, and can be housebroken.  Monkies also tend to display aggressive and sexual behavoirs.. they can also carry very nasty comminicable diseases.<br>  <br>  I have heard of monkies being trained to assist with other disabilities.. such as assisting someone who is quadropalegic with some daily activites like feeding.  <a href="http://www.monkeyhelpers.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.monkeyhelpers.org/</a>|`|P8hOtEdOaa	Monkeys are not big enough to be able to guide a blind human.  However, many are used for other severe physical disabilities.  They are taught to get things for the disabled and perform many daily tasks.  The biggest company training monkeys for the disabled is Helping Hands.
4yt4D3vMaa	Yes it is-it's also your filter bed. It's important not to use sand or gravel as the particles are too small for good water flow and you wouldn't get as good filtration.I put some medium size pebbles over mine so it's more attractive to look at :)|`|7KxQXHzOaa	it's gravel believe it or not|`|QjKJdFhwaa	i would gues that is a part of the filter media and it is where the bacteria colonize on.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there Ima,<br>  <br>  You really need to give your kitten more of an opportunity to develop and mature. Rags are known for great dispositions, but kittens are very different than cats. Kittens can transform from "lovers" to little "hellions" in an eye blink, no matter what the breed. Even mixed breed kittens can give the most devoted cat lover grey hairs now and again! <grin><br>  <br>  Kittens are known to be squiggly critters. They are active and energetic,( even the furry doorstop variety, such as the Rag Doll) who don't like to be confined on a lap or cuddled all the time. Try not to confine him, and let him come to you when he is feeling loving. If he is feeling "crowded" this will relieve his upset. Just let him be his own "purrson" while he matures.Just like you want to be loved for who you are, so do cats. <br>  <br>  <br>  While Ragdoll kittens' disposition are often more placid than others, breeders do caution folks who get kittens to be careful of them around children.<br>  <a href="http://www.rfci.org/info/description.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.rfci.org/info/description.php</a><br>  <br>  So I would give your little guy a chance to get used to you, to your household, and to his new environment. He is in new surroundings, so may still be a bit timid and anxious.<br>  <br>  You don't mention how old your kitten is, either. Most reputable Ragdoll breeders sell their kittens between 12-14 weeks-of-age, when they are more fully socialized with people and their siblings.<br>  <br>  Call the breeder and express your concern, which may provide some valuable information about your kitten.  Additionally not all cats of a breed always have the disposition for which they are bred.  But I bet that within a few weeks, your kitten may feel more secure and begin to display that famous Ragdoll purrsonality.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest joining a Ragdoll Yahoo group and get support and information from Ragdoll owners. They are a very active group by the way.<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/phrase/ragdolls">http://groups.yahoo.com/phrase/ragdolls</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Former CFA registered breeder of Siamese, Orientals, Russian Blues and Burmese<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|WqGxGJkbaa	That's life I'm afraid.  You can never be 100% certain of a cat's characteristics.  The breeder will have told you what you wanted to hear and you have been taken in by it.  If you had gone to an animal sanctuary you would have been able to sit with the "ordinary" cats and choose one which was more suitable to your requirements.<br>  <br>  Of course, if it is a kitten you might find that it becomes more cuddly as it gets older - but perhaps not.|`|8vbPlgqnaa	I want a ragdoll too due to their sweet nature.

5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Wow love...that is a top notch question.  This is one I have to deal with a lot...but it's more the owners that make it work or fail.  I have a small yorkie.  Since I have had her as a pup I have quietly had to "stay on her' about "no bark".  She just lets out what most people would not even call a bark now...it's more of a quiet, umph noise.  This is usually to tell me she is unhappy about something and if I let it go it will escalate into yappping.  Like you I believe this is an annoying sound...I mean it can be cute when they are puppies but when they go out to potty and do nothing but bark the entire time...the neighbors get mad and sometimes they just are so busy yapping outside that they come in a potty inside the house.  <br>  I tell the owners to keep them on a leash/leash handle inside pocket.  The first bark -- leash is pulled up/sit position/no,no,no bark --- if it does not stop tap nose-it's more just to keep attention diverted to you so you don't tap real hard...added with the long "shhhhhh" sound with more "no,no,no bard" keep repeating this until the dog is quiet.  While outside do not allow them to roam - keep them on a leash until they potty...do all the same as you do inside the house should barking occur.  <br>  After about 3-4 days it starts happening...but you have to keep up with it.  People allow their dogs bad habits then get mad at the dog when it is our job to help them "maintain" good behavior.  This is hard to stop and most people will/do not stay consistant enough for the amount of time it takes to make happen.  I have had dogs completely trained and in 2 weeks time when I go back for a "check up" the dog is back to their normal behavior as before trained.  If they would just say a stern "no bark, no, no, no" when the umph starts it would end... but they don't.  I allow barking when it's appropriate - a stranger comes to the door, excitement when her dog friend first pops through the door as a suprise...but a yapping dog makes people irritated even at the dog park.  Maybe you should mail your neighbor this :)...|`|Bw18seFqaa	dogs bark because they are bored, lonely, or not getting enough exercize or mental stimulation.<br>  <br>  Some people let their small dogs get away with obnoxious behavoirs because they are "cute and little"   people often also under-estimate how much exercize and mental stimulation small dogs need.

Whether they are small or big. a bored, unexercised dog will bark more and can become destructive, like digging holes or destroying furniture. But no one yet addressed a solution to the problem. Since you have already had an argument with your neighbor and they have done nothing to help the situation, they obviously don't care what you think, and it is possible they don't know what to do to remedy the situation. there are laws to protect your peace and quiet. Call your local law enforcement agency to find out your rights. Just as there is law enforcement for people's rights, there ae animal protection agencies. Animal control, the Humane Society, the ASPCA (in the USA) You can ask them to intervene. If the dogs are left out day and night, they have to have adequate food and shelter and they will be able to do this so you don't have to go over there any more.

I think the main problem is people tend to treat small dogs like babies, or toys, anything but actual dogs.

vjijiJT3aa	birds are very smart, they're small so they see us as giants, if you don't give them a better understanding of you they will be scared when you get to close. They have the ability to mimic sounds you make (most birds) and thats how they sound like they're talking. There is no comparison to other animals birds are very unique.
Eyawiwc5aa	W/ a full grown male your enclosure should be at least 7ft tall x 8-10ft long x 4ft wide.<br>  There are many ways to build an enclosure there are some toxic woods that you will want to avoid, also make sure that you use a good water sealer for wood, if you go w/ wood. Make sure that you do put the enclosure on wheels, makes it much easier to move if need. Make sure that you have a solid top, humidity rises, and just cut a hole for the heat lamps (CHE/Heat Projector/basking light) and use a dome cover. Make sure you do allow an area for air flow. White closet shelves do make great climbing and shelving for igs.<br>  For the UVB make sure that you are using one of the recommended UVB, w/ an adult iguana in an adult cage, you may want to look into MegaRays, they do get extremely hot, but give the best UVB ( <a href="http://www.reptileuv.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptileuv.com/</a> ). Might want to check out this page as well ( <a href="http://www.uvguide.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.uvguide.co.uk/</a> ). <br>  Make sure that you are using something for the water pan to go potty, w/ the older larger igs those storage bins for sweaters/clothes work great, because they are long but not too high for an ig to climb into. <br>  The 3 main ig links below all have some ideas/ways to build an enclosure. <br>  <br>  Sites for you to read:<br>  <a href="http://www.greenigsociety.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenigsociety.org/</a> - <a href="http://www.iguanaden.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iguanaden.org/</a> - <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html</a><br>  A great book to read and have on hand:<br>  Iguanas for Dummies by Melissa Kaplan<br>  Yahoo has some great sites for Iguana owners... these groups helped me and still help w/ questions .. if you'd like to join:<br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/BabyIguana/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/BabyI...</a> - <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/IguanaDen/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Iguan...</a>|`|xe7mylLmaa	Iguana veteran here and I fully reinforce what Evanescence said.
4V4m2uZ5aa	Your pup is still young and I think you can totally correct this situation.<br>  <br>  First try to enroll in a puppy class. You need help and starting on some training is going to help. <br>  <br>  Your pup may have had to fight with her litter mates for every morsel she got. Now she thinks she still has to do that. For right now feed them separate. Don't even have them anywhere near each other. Next when your pup is eating pet and love all over her and show her you will not take her food. If it were me and this was my pup if she became aggressive with me I would grab her by the collar, pull her up, give her a good shake, tell her no in a firm voice. Then I would let her return to her food and do it all over again if it happened again. I know I'm going to get some thumbs down and that's ok. The fact is if you don't get this behavior under control NOW while your pup is young it's only going to get worse. It may even go to a point where you have to get rid of her. You're going to have to be tough. Now when she no longer shows aggression towards you then you can bring your other dog back into the mix and practice the same thing with the dog.<br>  <br>  Please give this a try. I feel very confident this will work. <br>  <br>  Don't forget to start some obedience. This will give you the tools you need to teach your dog some manners.<br>  <br>  If you run into a wall with this you can email me and we'll talk more. My husband and I raise and train Border Collies so I'm very familiar with this breed.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm glad I could help. Please keep in mind that you are the top dog (no pun intended). If your dog growls at you when you are doing this exercise with her DO NOT stop. That is the point when you grap the collar, pick her up, and give her a good shake then let her start eating again. If she stops the growling then let her know she did a good job. Don't over do your praise a good girl along with your petting will be sufficient. <br>  I agree about the "cringe" factor. It is never a good idea to hit your dog exspecially in the face. Our hands are for praise.  <br>  You are not hitting your dog with this exercise just giving her a good shake.<br>  Let me know how it goes.<br>  <br>  Hey I just completely read Jack's answer. That's also a good idea. This is one of the reasons I love this because you can really learn alot. <br>  The only thing I would like to point out is, at some point you have to use your hands for discipline. This does not include beating your dog but some situations will occur where you will be forced to use your hands for corrections. I do understand what Jack is saying. Some very valuable info in his answer.|`|TgNQAYyXaa	Agree with Rosebud BUT I never, EVER discipline my dog with my hand.  Otherwise, the dog could become a "cringer",  If you raise your hand suddenly, it will cringe.  Not a nice sight.  Have a rolled up newspaper when you feed the dog.  When it growls at you, say "NO" in the deepest voice you can and whack the newspaper on your leg to make a loud noise.  This is ONLY for effect and to reinforce your NO command.  Timing is the key, the dog MUST know that growling at you is NOT acceptable under ANY circumstance.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  LOL Rosebud, I must confess that if my boy get overexcited, I do give him a quick sharp pinch (not a popular action with some people in YA).  This nips his unacceptable behavior in the bud (no pun intended). When you have a 43 kilo dog, sometimes a stern word just does not work (go figure).

AA12048299	I agree, you're going to have to bathe her to remove the mud, if only in this one spot. If it's still cold out, be sure to have plenty of towels on hand to dry her promptly. Also, wool coolers.<br>  <br>  In the future, try t/o with a t/o sheet to help prevent this type of mud. Also, groom her daily to prevent buildup.<br>  <br>  As a last ditch effort, you can always shave the area, but you're going to wear out your blades quickly due to the dirt, and have to keep her blanketed afterward if you remove a bunch of hair.|`|RloOJ43haa	If you have a metal curry comb, that is usually good for breaking up and removing mud.

If youve already curryed it and it didnt come off, try getting a sponge, getting the area wet, shampooing, and rinsing it. Still not off? Whether your mare likes it or not, you may have to pull some of it off. Have someone hold her, and pull it off like a band aid. Hopefully you can get it off before you have to pull it?|`|5eu5P1hYaa	Well, I don't know if your in a place that's snowing or not, but if it's warm enough or if you have a heated barn, you could give her a bath, that is sure to get the mud off, but if you can't give her a bath, just take a damp sponge or cloth and wipe it over the mud. that should loosen it up a bit.  If you have the time, just use a sponge and keep wiping it until it's gone.  That would be time consuming, but it would be most comfortable for her.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!! :P|`|VbOhwOr5aa	1. Get a hose and spray her where the mud is. (tip: put your thumb over the end for a stronger spray)<br>  2.

Just bath her with the hose on a lower level of spray.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	No, that's very normal, actually. Dogs are pack animals and naturally want to be with their families, so separation anxiety is terribly common. (And she is absolutely not a "coward" because of her bond with you guys. Her family is her world; unlike you, she doesn't have friends, school, work, whatever. Just you. I can't blame her for being distressed when you leave.)

o4trSMiHaa	You smell things by dispersion, this means tiny little particles float of into the air and you breathe them in onto scent receptors in your nose. so yes there most likley is microscopic particles all over your stuff, but there is nothing you can do about it. You can try an air freshener such as oust which works by binding the particles in the air with better smelling chemicals which also kill the bacteria. <br>  <br>  But really the tiny particles arent going to harm you in anyway, just think whats floating around outside lol.

It certainly wouldn't hurt.  And if he pooped on carpet, a little extra cleaning around that area would help.  <br>  <br>  And one of the best chemicals you can use to get rid of the smell is bleach.  So any area you can wipe with bleach will kill the odor right on.<br>  <br>  But then you have the bleach odor.  Kick up the windows, spray some good air freshener and that odor will dissipate.<br>  <br>  When it comes to anything that can come out of a dog from any orvice I have been through it.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi Andraya,<br>  <br>  First of all, I highly suggest that your vet put your kitty on a diet, if she is fat. Obese cats are prone to develop some serious medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and kidney problems. Your kitty will live a lot longer with better health when she trims down some.!<br>  <br>  Ashley is a very pretty name, but when folks ask me about what to name their cats, I always suggest that they pick something about their cat that is special. Watch her behavior and find a personality "quirk" that you find amusing, or something about her markings that strike you.<br>  <br>  We had an ebony smoke oriental kitten a long time ago that we had problems naming. One day she was sitting on my husband's lap, with her huge ears tilted sideways on her face, looking adorable. My husband said that she looked just like one of those creatures in a movie that we loved, "Gremlins". She was named on the spot, and she really responded almost immediately to it.<br>  <br>  So if you are not in love with the name Ashley, try naming her based on her behavior, how she looks, her markings, or how you feel about her. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer ( named for my cat, Trouble, who is now called Hubble)<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|TdrgZwnoaa	The cat doesn't care what you call it.

Phantoms often last longer than the real thing however, and it will pull her down physically to be like this, especially if she's producing milk.   I've never had to do this but I believe there is a hormonal treatment to stop all this (apart from spaying!!).  As it's likely she will do this after every season, I'd seriously consider having her spayed before the next one.  I've never heard that phantoms can make a ****** more likely to have uterine infections - infections = bugs?!!  However, the longer you leave her unspayed, the more the risk of her developing cancers, mammary, uterine, in later life, so that's another reason for getting her spayed, if you don't intend to take a litter from her.  And it is definitely NOT necessary for a ****** to have a litter before being spayed!!|`|Bw18seFqaa	let her have the toys, it comforts her, and she's not harming anything.<br>  <br>  You should make an arrangement to have her spayed.  False pregnancies put a female at an increased risk for cancers and deadly uterine infections.  Spaying is a good preventative measure.

uB4ZQOEDaa	we have a ten year old horsefield and have tried out various foods to feed him such as all the recommended weeds etc but he just prefers gem lettuce and apple.  we keep him in a shallow open top enclosure (actually an under bed storage tray) - its about 1 metre square and is half filled with a substrate of soil and play sand. Over his enclosure we have a uv light and a heat lamp which he has on for around 10 hrs a day - its important to put uv light off at night so that he recognises night from day. He has a den in his enclosure to hide in (a half bucket) and a shallow dish with water which he can drink from and bathe in.  We also give him a bath twice a week to keep him hydrated. we often bring him out of his pen and he has chance to roam around the house but he usually ends up fast asleep in front of the fire (he loves it). He also loves the freedom of roaming the garden when the temp is 15 degrees or above.<br>  good luck and have fun.|`|yzoTvZxNaa	I wonder if you have tried this one I always go on it to find out more about animals :)<br>  <a href="http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/horsfield2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/ho...</a><br>  <br>  x Hoped I helped x<br>  x Good luck looking after your tortoise x

HZvdr8VLaa	Not only do my roosters crow off and on all day long, I've heard them crow in the middle of the night. This always makes me think something is moving around out there that woke them up, so I have to look around for predators. Roosters crow to claim their territory. That's why when one rooster crows, all of the rest will soon follow. A lot of times when one of the lower ranked roosters crows, the dominant rooster will chase him around the yard. Kind of like a "how dare you do that when I'm here" kind of thing. Roosters are funny to watch and have a lot of personality!|`|vjijiJT3aa	It's their job, and they do it well.|`|CgqQLj2vaa	it's because male chicken start loosing its eyesight as sun sets. so they r not able to  see anything in the  evening &at night. but when the sun rises in the morning they can see everything and thus they become happy . in order to express their happiness they make sound.<br>  <br>  just hope u have got ur answer.|`|8e9718a3714dc906919f4f8f94450b65aa	They say he greets the beginning of the day that way and to let everybody know that this is his territory and is able to defend it.|`|bWcW1fsoaa	i have rosters and they crow on and off all day long it is not just in the Morning time, im not sure the reason , but i do know that when one crows the rest of them follow in suit|`|YNKakLMraa	why u go behind them to here the sound in the morning

ZMWjdKfraa	THE MEANING & SYMBOLISM OF <br>  heather <br>  Heather’s scientific name, “Calluna vulgaris,” comes from the Greek “Kallune,” meaning “to clean or brush,” and the Latin “vulgaris,” meaning “common,” as heather twigs were once used for making brooms. Native to Ireland, Scotland, Scandinavia, Russia and North America, heather branches are also said to have been used to make baskets, rope, bedding, as thatch for roofs and even to flavor beer or tea. Today, it’s the beautiful heather flowers—in colors ranging from white to pink, purple and red – that draw our attention.  Symbolizing admiration and good luck, heather is also believed have protective powers.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	From The Language of Flowers:<br>  <br>  Heather-lavendar: Admiration; Solitude<br>  Heather-white: Protection; Wishes will Come True<br>  <br>  The English name Heather means - Signifies a flower associated with Scotland.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Just another floral name,dearie...Daisy,Rose,Ivy.....etc.

rHqe7oMoaa	Dogs have a hierarchial structure within their 'pack' (group). You are seen as the leader of the pack (because you provide the food) but ay dogs that you have need to sort out between themselves their own pecking order. <br>  <br>  This type of humping behaviour is usually done to show dominance (higher in the pack hierarchy than the hump-ee).<br>  <br>  The fact that your puppy is presenting himself for it may indicate submissiveness to the older dog ie. 'please don't put me in my place by growling at me because I already know it'.<br>  <br>  Generally, older dogs are higher up in the pack than the younger dogs, un-neutered dogs higher than neutered dogs. The exceptions are, of course, if the older dog is sick/injured. <br>  <br>  There is nothing to worry about with your puppy doing this, but if it disturbs you, you can always distract him if he does it (and then reward him when he listens to you).|`|9nDhR7xWaa	you may find that this is something called nature|`|tFKQYT6Naa	well idk about the 3 month old but the 3 year old is probably doing it becuz hes looking for a girl to mate with|`|X0KaYUEWaa	Hi,<br>  This may be to do with domination, a lot of dogs especially young ones like to hump things to try and show their dominance especially over humans this may be your puppies way of asking the older dog if he wants to be the "top" dog as he is last in the pack so he supposedly would be the bottom of the pack<br>  Alan

Normally they do request them back if you take them to another vet, but certainly have no problem with you doing so.  <br>  <br>  If I want x-rays for my personal records, I simply request an extra x-ray be done for my records.

If you don't have any problems controlling your dog and you dog follows commands, I don't see anything wrong with it.  I let my dogs do it, but I make them sit first and ask to sit on my lap versus them jumping up when ever they feel like it.  If they ask to sit on your lap, then you are the alpha, but if they jump up on you and expect to sit on your lap than they are just walking all over you.|`|PK506WbBaa	We have a beagle mix.

qjquVj0daa	You can not stop it. Pit Bulls are very difficult to handle. You really have to know what you are doing to raise this breed safely. The older dog has a new rival for it's territory and your affection. You need to go to a professional dog trainer. If you do not do not be surprised when you home home and one of the dogs is dead. i would suggest you stop getting pit bulls.

k5mUMLJPaa	With proper training and a good foundation.  <br>  Yes|`|iZml58CAaa	A Rottweiler is an inappropriate pet for a house with small children. They are simply too big and powerful. What is more important, getting a cool looking dog or protecting your kids? If you have children under 6, you really should not get any dog until your kids get bigger. Having a dog should be a positive experience for the whole family. Most puppies nip/bite and will hurt a small child. The child will then resent the dog and lash back at it.<br>  <br>  If you have older kids (6-10) try a brittany spaniel, golden or a small terrier. Forget about the tough guy breeds like rottweilers, pit bulls and bulldogs. If you want a dog with a big woof to scare burglers, try a basset hound. They may not look very intimidating, but the sound like a bloodhound and love to bark. Plus, they are gentle and adorable dogs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doggonehairy.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doggonehairy.net/</a>|`|yUkFvtudaa	Rotts can be an awesome dog with families.  Just like the previous posts, how well trained are the kids?  How much are you willing to invest in training the dog?  I had a rotti that had many hours of training.  She went through all the training including hand commands until bite work for protection.  It cost around $2,000 and well worth it.  She would've continued but the trained no longer did it.  She was an excellant dog.  I would've trusted her with anyone including young kids.  Anyone she was taught as "friend" would NEVER have to worry about a thing.  And she would NOT go after anything unless told to, but would hold her ground if danger.  So, are you willing to put in the training, love, and attention to the dog, if so, they are well worth it!|`|bIaywrBCaa	Depends on the age of the kids. I wouldn't have a big dog around babies or toddlers.<br>  <br>  btw I am a big fan of rotties, just do not think small kids and large dogs mix well.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Yup sure do, buy from a good breeder that breeds for temperament, make sure you spend the time to do the proper socializing and the proper training. It's a dog, don't treat it like a furry baby..|`|7373301fb91991a1469991a708c2565caa	Whether a Rottie will be good with kids depends on a lot of things. -- First: How well behaved are the kids? -- Then how well bred is the Rottie? <br>  <br>  Like Pit bulls, Rotties have gotten a bad reputation for being one of the breeds that most frequently bites, and for doing a lot of damage when they do bite.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would like a dog with less bite potential around young children.<br>  <br>  I had three young children when I first got into dog breeding. -- Then I had three Grand Children. I now have 5 Great Grand Children. -- None of these have ever been bitten by one of my dogs! <br>  <br>  Be wise. Get a breed that is KNOWN to be tolerant of children, then make sure that you get it from a reputable breeder. <br>  <br>  And last but not least, make sure that your children are properly trained to be respectful of the dog!<br>  <br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|vvJBtxXHaa	Yes, the breed is loving and repsonsive to human behavior....they are intelligent and require a lot of attention in training...and worth every penny of care they receive<br>  <br>  I stongly recommend continuous obedience training after 6 months, as they are physically demanding animals otherwise <br>  ...many Petsmart stores offer interactive training methods that are conducted in each store with many other dog owners...the dogs learn to respond among people and other dogs, appropriately|`|ghz5D5iLaa	We used to have one and he was great with the kids.|`|qoxAmc9Xaa	yes i had one when i was a kid
EnwYxbS4aa	My cat has the same thing and its actually very difficult to get rid of.  <br>  <br>  The vet said its a form of the cat flu virus which is very difficult to get rid of completely and treatment is more along the lines of minimizing it as opposed to curing it.<br>  <br>  If it gets too bad you will have to bring her back to the vet and he may give her some steroids to help her breath and more antibiotics. <br>  <br>  But I have found that one capsule of L- Lysine (which is a natural supplement found in health food shops it treats the herpes virus and upper respitory virus) sprinkled into her food daily is excellent at keeping the symptoms at bay.<br>  <br>  If you research L- Lysine for cats on the internet youll find lots of people find it really good for this problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck because its a gross problem!!|`|4aAhEK9daa	If all she had was a cold your vet would have given her medication.  There's no cure for colds - they have to run their course just like human colds.  She obviously has an an upper respiratory infection.  <br>  <br>  Did you give her the meds for ten days/twice a day as prescribed?  And when did the meds run out?  Sometimes it takes a second course of medication to clear up a particularly bad infection.<br>  <br>  I find it a bit sad that rather than feeling bad for a cat you just got you're complaining her "sneezing snot", you're complaining about her "expectionally loud" snoring, her "gross sneezing fits", how "annoying" it is, etc.  Are you sure you really want this cat?  It sure doesn't sound like it.<br>  <br>  Get her back to the vet - or back to the shelter.<br>  <br>  edit: the suggestion for L-Lysine is a very good one.  When my cats get URI's I give them a 500mg tablet daily till they're better and it helps them get better much faster than just on the meds.  You can find them in the vitamin aisle.|`|K1prVAsjaa	Maybe the dust in her litter? Try switching to a dust free litter.

I would not really think it is wise.  the liver is what metabolizes most chemicals in the body, and if it is not functioning right, you may cause more problems.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	I would say not. your vet would know the answer but thinking it is to dangerous most times flea medicine says the animals should be healthy. i would ask a vet for an alternative that would not harm your cat. Sorry she is so sick!|`|vv2uk9hHaa	DON'T give it to your cat without asking a vet. First of all, if you cat has cancer, it shouldn't be going outside, that would avoid the flea problem in the first place. Flea medication is very toxic, and if your cat has cancer it is already weak, this could be very dangerous if you give it to him.|`|XVTCsfWVaa	Please be careful.<br>  My grandparents lost an older cat they had during a flea bath at the vet office.<br>  So my concern would be for the health/strength to under go it. If it is not necessary only routine prevention my vote is to skip it.<br>  Good Luck|`|FFLUenuMaa	yea its not going to hurt it
XVTCsfWVaa	My Cats always knew when I became pregnant. My sisters dog as well. The cat loves you probably knows that you are getting closer to  delivery date. Probably smell change he/she can detect you can not. <br>  My cats actually would bond closer to my husband during pregnancy than me. So I am happy to hear yours is still loving toward you. <br>  <br>  The cat is probably anxious and wondering who this new person will be.

sBsFK2h5aa	Oh, mine too! And he is too lazy to come over and be patted x3 HaHa. No, she probably isnt too spolied.<br>  1. If she is a kitten, it can be a good thing. It means she will be friendly when she an adult, and not skiddish and mean.<br>  2. If she is an adult, she just likes being loved. <br>  <br>  Its not a bad thing, we have three cats, and two are fenominaly friendly. The other is treated the exact same way, but isnt as friendly. Its just simply her personality. If you dont like it, Im sure a lot of people would love a cat like that ;3|`|Uhyu3iCbaa	Maybe she feels insecure about something.  It's good that she loves you enough to want your attention, but if she never wants to do anything on her own, she may have some kind of emotional distress.

ErjSVRkqaa	To start with...probably about 2 15 minute walks a day, when he gets older probably 2 30 minute walks a day.<br>  <br>  Play with your puppy as much as you want! It depends on how playful he is....just whenever he brings you a toy and you have time, play with him!|`|BDRIeLqUaa	most puppies at his age should get enough exercise just being a pup, and like a young horse- he should not be walked- until he is a little closer to 6m|`|DTGO1pgyaa	Activity:   The Shih Tzu enjoys short daily walks or vigorous indoor play sessions and games. They are very well suited for apartment or condominium dwelling. However, they love to play outside, so a small fenced yard is ideal.|`|20fqa5hCaa	Keep your exercise sessions short and frequent.  Puppies should not be walked on hard surfaces for long periods of time.  Playing on grass is the best.  Remember, puppies get tired all of a sudden and need to sleep.  I would go with what the puppy asks for unless he/she is lethargic.  Then you need to check with a vet.|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	u should walk him probably 15 minutes and play 2 times a day for 15- 30!
agh18eT2aa	Take the dog with you because a dog that small will probably have to use a teacup breed harness until it grows a little, so taking the dog with you is a good way to fit in the store.  The personnel should not mind as long as they are making a sale.  I use a harness on my beagle because she pulls so hard during her walks trying to get to squirrels and stuff that she was choking herself on the collar.  A harness goes around the rib cage, so your dog's throat will not get all the pressure.  Harnesses are great, I don't walk my dog any other way.  Also, the leash does not fall in front of the dog's feet with a harness like with a collar, so she won't step on the leash and get tangled in it.  Harness is much better.  If you can find one the right size, Puppia makes a great padded one.  It's very comfy for the dog.|`|ecYNiE0maa	<a href="http://www.upco.com/-size-right-adjustable-harness-click-more-info-for-colors" rel="nofollow">http://www.upco.com/-size-right-adjustab...</a><br>  This 1 works well on my doxie but at 8 weeks old you will have to get 1 it grows with|`|pMMcEvFsaa	I totally agree! Collars are a recipe for disaster! Harnesses give the dog support and are nearly impossible to slip out of. Here is a link to a harness I found on www.dog.com.

AA11887983	The adult dog will probably be pretty vocal with the pup for a bit.  Pups are a bit dense when it comes to dog language, and sometimes the adult has to teach them.  There may even be some snaps or growls when the younger one is irritating the adult, but there should not be any contact.  If the pup responds appropriately, then the adult will leave him alone.  It sounds like they are doing ok, but I would not leave them unattended yet.  Just let them get better acquainted.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	while you need to make sure the new pup is safe- you need to let them sort out who will be top dog- it often has nothing to do with age, size|`|FFLUenuMaa	the big dog is just trying to protect the little dog so u dont have to worry. its like if it was her only child|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	i dont think this is too concerning but u might just want to keep an eye on them and if it gets a little more aggressive like baring teeth and flipping her over u might be concerned!|`|HmMR9Nupaa	its just depends on what the tiny dog might be doing to the bigger dog maybe|`|xq8Q1w3Paa	oh...so uhh.. shes acting like a mom!! hehe! their ok. leave them be. but stay around to supervise =]
nQdGGBN4aa	We have experience with ferals - 10 of them:<br>  <br>  - 3 (Joe, Carly, Heidi) who were dumped on us by the mother<br>  <br>  - 4 (Dorian, Tanner, Arthur, Dennis) we rescued after their mother was killed by a car<br>  <br>  - 1 (Cody) who showed up on our driveway<br>  <br>  - 1 (Wendy) who showed up on Halloween<br>  <br>  - 1 (Cece) who a neighbor caught and asked us to raise.<br>  <br>  We did not know anything about ferals when the mother dumped the 3 kittens on us during the winter of 2003. <br>  <br>  We did not trap them until they were about 5 months old - too old to tame. They are not our cats, per say, they are simply 3 cats who live with us. Only one of them will let us touch him to scratch his head and only at arm's length and only for a few seconds.<br>  <br>  Had we trapped them earlier, there would have been a better chance of taming them.<br>  <br>  The four kittens we trapped after their mother was killed are a different story.<br>  <br>  We kept them in a very  large cage - 6' tall, 3 12' wide and 2' deep which had four different levels.<br>  <br>  We kept them in the cage for about a week and a half to let them get used to things.<br>  <br>  Then we began reaching into the cage to touch them. They tolerated it a bit at first and more as the days went by.<br>  <br>  Once we could handle them without their getting really spooked - about 1 1/2 months after we  caught them, we began taking them into the bedroom, shutting the door, and letting them stay in the bedroom until nighttime when we put them back in the cage. We had other cats and the, the adults, sort of mothered the 4  ferals. That did wonders towards taming them.<br>  <br>  It got to the point where, in the morning, all 4 wanted to get out of the cage to go to the bedroom at the same time. Try carrying 4 kittens at one time can be quite difficult :-)<br>  <br>  These kittens were quite young when we trapped them - no more than 8 or 9 weeks. This made is much easier to tame them.<br>  <br>  It was about 4 1/2 months before we gave them the run of the house.<br>  <br>  Dorian and Arthur let us handle and pick them up. They have both become lap cats.<br>  <br>  Tanner has begun getting on my lap when I'm sitting in the kitchen but otherwise we can't pick him up. When we are on the bed he will come to us and he sleeps on the bed, up against me.<br>  <br>  The fourth, Dennis, is more tame than the 3 kittens we trapped at about 5 months of age, but does not show up very often except for mornings to get some treats - we have a diabetic cat who gets an insulin injection in the morning and my wife gives him treats afterwords and Dennis shows up to get some treats,<br>  <br>  As to the kitten who showed up on the driveway. He showed up on Thursday of the week we trapped the other 4 kittens. I trapped the others on Monday and Wednesday. Cody showed up on Thursday.<br>  <br>  I don't know - maybe there are signs around our house saying that we are an easy mark for cats and kittens :-)<br>  <br>  Anyway - we treated this kitten the same way as the 4 kittens. He did not tame down as quickly as them, but he is how about 90% tame.<br>  <br>  He doe not like to be picked up - you do so at your own risk, you might get scratched if you are not careful - but you can  touch and play with him and he sleeps on the bed with us.<br>  <br>  The kitten that showed up on Halloween took longer to tame and she still will not let you pick her up. She will let her touch her and when we are on the bed, she is all lovey-duby and lets you give her a good rubbing.<br>  <br>  The kitten a neighbor caught is turning out to be the hardest to tame. She was about 12 weeks old when we got her.<br>  <br>  We set up one of the cages in the bedroom and have her in it.<br>  <br>  We let her out, with the bedroom door closed, for several hours each day and put her back in the cage before we go to bed.<br>  <br>  Only my wife can pick her up to put her back in the cage and only if she grabs Cece carefully and gently and even then she often has to put the kitten down before she is scratched.<br>  <br>  Most of the time we  simply wait and Cece goes back in the cage and we close the door but sometimes my wife is successful in putting her back in the cage.<br>  <br>  We both have been scratched pretty good by Cece and it will be a long time before she is tame enough to be given the run of the house. I don't expect Cece to be tame, in any way, for at least another 3 to 4 months.<br>  <br>  She has begun to come to us when we are on the bed and she allows us to touch her but we can't not pick her up. She will run away if we handle her too much or try to pick her up.<br>  <br>  My advise to you - if you are really willing to tame your kitten - is to keep her in the cage, try reaching into it to pet her, and  letting her out of the cage in a room with the doors closed - after you are able to touch her to get her back into the cage.<br>  <br>  If you have any doubts about getting her back in the cage, don't let her out.<br>  <br>  It may take a while before she lets you touch her for more than a few seconds or even at all.<br>  <br>  She needs time to get used to being indoors and in the cage. Don't rush it.<br>  ---------------- my message got cut off when I submitted it. I won't retype everything that was lost, but here's the gist of it-------<br>  <br>  She - the feral you have - will never be a domesticated cat, she is a feral cat<br>  <br>  She may be tame-able but it will take more than the month or two which you will have her.<br>  <br>  Since you are going to have the cat for only 1 or 2 months, I doubt you will be able to make any really progress towards taming her.<br>  <br>  I'd just keep her in the cage - I hope is a fairly large cage - and try to touch her by reaching into the cage.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't want to be touched, don't push it.<br>  <br>  Don't expect to be able to handle her a lot or even pick her up.<br>  <br>  At this stage, the cat will most defintely scatch and bite you if you mishandle her.<br>  <br>  Don't simply try to reach in and grab her. You will likely be scratched or even bitten.<br>  <br>  I've been bitten 3 times by feral cats. Each time it was my fault for trying to pick them up too soon or when I had to grab a cat when it almost got loose when we were transferring it from a trap to a cage.<br>  <br>  Cat bites hurt. You must also treat the wound to prevent any infection.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid being bitten is to not handle the cat until you are sure it will not explode when you try to pick it up.<br>  <br>  Again, 1 or 2 months is not enough time to make any real progress towards taming a feral cat.<br>  <br>  Please email me so we can discuss this in more detail<br>  <br>  My yahoo profile allows you to email me.|`|AA12022623	Yikes! I'm torn...do you hold onto the cat and possibly have her in your environment for maybe 15 plus years, return her to the rescue people with a humble and honest apology or perhaps another agency like Humane Society...I would have to return her for the sanity of my family and me. Good luck! and don't feel guilty.|`|tBUtvh8uaa	first if all dont leave her in that cage for too long it will make ti worse... i also think best option is to put the cage in a room, let her see you leave kitty littler and food so she sees you are feeding her, this will make her trust you a little more... leave the cage door open so she can come out when she is ready , go into the room every now and then till she feels comfortable with you being around then start trying to pat her, till she feels comfortable being touched, when she is comfortable with this leave the room door open and she can slowly come out and get used to everything else...|`|58h70voyaa	Put the cat in a room with a liter pan and some food open the cage shut the door leave the cat alone  for awhile check in on the cat let it get use to the place one room at a time be patient .Patience are  a vertue.  hopefully the cat will realize your just trying to help it, and eventually warm up to you.  GOOD LUCK!!|`|W1k9tpuaaa	Lol thats funny you should go to your local human and explain the situation to the people maybe they'll take the cat or just take the poor kitty to the spca|`|IRaIxWJKaa	There are ways to desensitize. The more she sees of you the better, but talk quietly and keep the noise level down.<br>  <br>  Use a wood dowel or feather wand to help get her used to touch.  Put a glove on the end of the dowel and stuff it a little with paper towels, tape in on.  Then use that to lightly touch her every few seconds for about 20 minutes at a time. Do that twice a day, or a bit more.  This gets her used to something touching her while you're at a distance, and the touch isn't a grab or hold, and she can't get away from it.<br>  <br>  Socializing ferals in small rooms are done this way--you put the cats in, sit on the floor and spend half an hour just reaching out to where the cat is and touching it briefly and lifting the wand/glove/whatever away.  They learn that it isn't harmful and that they can't get away from it, and eventually just stop moving out of the way of it and settling down.  Next step is to do a stroking on their back with it.  Once they get used to that, you use a feather wand to 'play' in front of them with, and occasionally stroke them with it.  <br>  <br>  Talk quietly as you do that part, and they adjust faster than they would if you did nothing but set the food bowls down and try to catch them occasionally.<br>  <br>  She's young enough that food will be a factor too.  When you interact with her don't try hand petting her, just put down a small piece of baked chicken (no coating or bones), about the size of a quarter.  Say something quietly and back off to let her eat it.  When you are consistent with small treats like this it makes your presence more welcome to them.  Cats love chicken and it's a good training tool.<br>  <br>  She's under 4 months of age, you can completely turn her around with your actions.  It's the older cats who lived years without people that are much harder.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Why not contact the rescue place and ask them for advice. If they don't have any you may be able to arrange a visit with another foster parent. They could give you advice.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Well just try to hold her down and just pet her.. She doesn't know you so shes probably quite scared.<br>  Wouldn't you be?<br>  And pet and her everyday and she'll love you in probably about 4-7 days.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	It's pretty much impossible to socialize a feral/wild cat to a point that someone looking to adopt a pet cat would be willing to take it in.  You can socialize them enough that they won't attack you and may possibly stay in the same room with you, but they will never be affectionate pets.<br>  <br>  The worst thing you can do is try to hold her down and pet her.  You might as well light her tail on fire because that's about the same thing on the freak-out meter for feral cats.  You are bigger, thus you are a predator.  If you hold her down and do something to her, she thinks you're trying to eat her.  Please don't do that to her.<br>  <br>  Having a feral cat is like having a wild raccoon or a possum in your house.  It's a wild animal and probably always will be.  I suggest you have her spayed and get her shots and then let her go on her way.  It's best for everyone.  If you really want to help feral cats, donate or volunteer for one of the many catch-neuter-release groups that focuses on controlling the wild cat population.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	well it'll feel scared in the cage but definitly keep it in there for now.  After a week of feeding it and giving it water i think it might realize that your not going to hurt it.  Maybe see if you could bring it into a small room with  nothing it can hide under and open the cage, and stay in one spot and hold out your hand and let it come to you and maybe hold food in your hand.  <br>  It's kinda young so it might have some hope in becoming a social cat.  <br>  Give it time, and be careful.<br>  and have you taken it to a vet yet to make sure it doesn't have any diseases or have its shots? if not you should do so asap|`|4MA9yNPVaa	Try and find a vet that will spay her now. They can be done safely as soon as they weigh 2lbs, but not all vets will do it that young. She needs to be spayed and released back into the wild. She has had no human interaction for the first month or two of her life and it is now too late to tame her. She is absolutly freaked out.  If you are fostering her for a rescue and you don't feel comfortable keeping her in your house let the know this.

qqeus5kCaa	I have a cat that eats entirely too fast as well, She is afraid that the others are going to eat it and she wont have any for herself... <br>  what was told to do by my vet was to put a tennis ball in her dish so it slows her down because she has to eat around it. It slows her down. <br>  I also found dishes at the pet store that has sectionals standing up in it so that worked better than the tennis balls... <br>  it really helped|`|0mb78CiWaa	Cats vomit for hundreds of reason. Some reasons are normal others are deadly. I would pay your vet a visit, they can help you.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	That could be the reason.......<br>  <br>  To stop this, go to Petsmart, or other pet store, and get one of those toys that has holes in it, for kibble to come out of.  You fill the toy with kibble ( dry food ), and the cat has to WORK to get his food.  This keeps him occupied AND not able to "gobble" his food.  See if that helps with the vomiting........<br>  <br>  Hope this is the right answer for your cat........Good luck.|`|5ZrVP3Xjaa	Hello, and I'm here to answer your question.<br>  My cat does that too, but it's mostly because she eats too fast and doesn't really chew her food very well. I read in a book that fresh grass can reduce hair balls and puking. But what we do is we pet our cat while she eats and that's supposed to calm her down a bit. Either that or we lift her head just a bit by the scruff of the neck to get her to get her face away from her cat food and get her to actually chew her food. Hope this helps! Good Luck!|`|3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	My cat does that too.  Make sure you are feeding your cat a good quality food.  Sometimes dyes and other ingredients are too rich or affect its tummy.  I have learned to feed my cat smaller amounts of food more but more frequently so that not so much is digested (inhaled) at one feeding and can be processed easier.|`|AA11473256	could be sick...|`|AA11431152	Umm, it depends. maybe your cat food is rotton, your cat is alergic to something in it, or maybe its old. If you change your cat food it might help. Or maybe your cat is just sick. If it continues i would go to a vet. Oh and, make sure you don't leave too much little stuff on the floor. If shes under a year old she might be eating liter. You ccan change that too. Or it could be a hairball. It could also be a sign of pregnancy. hope this helps
HvbIE03saa	Does he do this when you're playing with him at other times?<br>  <br>  He's probably just getting really into it and "talking" to you while he plays, lol. It's cute.
RPaHObubaa	Rat may eat their feces. This is called coprophagy, and it is the way rats "recycle" nutrients, including B vitamins. There is nothing to worry about. I really hope this helps! Don't listen to anyone who says rats are gross.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	Hello, first of all spaying reduces hormones not removes them.<br>  Rats like other animals (dogs mainly) will sometimes eat their own feces. It seems extremely wierd to us but to them it is just something to munch on. It will not harm her at all. The only way to stop is to remove every piece of poop constantly, which would be near impossible.<br>  <br>  It will probably pass in time.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|OawkeUEEaa	Well, you should try and take it to the vet. it could be a stress problem. also clean that part of the cage every day. it is very harmful to eat there own poo. it also may be boredom. do you take it out often? give them a ball to roll around in. hope this helps!|`|ylt11fjbaa	As a rat owner I know of two things that could be happening here:<br>       1) Maybe the older one thinks of the younger one as a daughter. In the wild adult animals will often eat the young's fecal matter to cover up there tacks so no predators will hunt them down to eat them.<br>       2) Or, the younger one isn't getting all of the nutrients out of her food because she may eat to fast.<br>  <br>  It won't hurt them to eat it though.|`|aoSX3MEvaa	All small animals eat poop. Gross, I know, but there's really nothing you can do about it.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  BTW I don't think rats are gross, if anybody thinks I do.|`|rOZ1WSqNaa	Maybe she's just picking it up in her mouth and moving it to another area and spitting it out when you don't notice? That's all I can think of... ^w^<br>  Hope I Helped xxx|`|UAqGhehaaa	I am not really sure, as my rats are young. My guess is that your older rat's digestive System might not be working fully so she eats her poop to get all her nutrients. If she is eating poop, it wont harm her. Poop is basically chewed up food and stomach acid. Eating it (if my above guess is correct) will actually help her. And as for the commentator calling rats dirty, I HIGHLY doubt he has ever even seen a proper rat, as rats are sweet, clean and intelligent.

SLSX6QQsaa	It's possible that he's having tooth issues, or he could just be playing, or chewing out of boredom.  You know your cat better than anyone else so if you think somethings wrong check into it.   I would check his mouth really good, and theres an easiest way to do this.  Wait until your cat is laying down sleeping peacefully and come up behind him ever so carefully.  You are going to pull his head back a little so you can see in his mouth and his mouth will be forced open.  Thats the easiest way.  Or you can wrap him in a towel with only his face showing and force his mouth open.  Then you want to check for any brown spots on his teeth, especially the back molars where they tend to get infected.  Also check his gums and make sure they are not inflamed or receding.  There is a disease that is similar to cavities but actually just eats away a cats teeth but theres nothing you can do to prevent it.  It just happens and you have to treat it as things happen.  That could be a common possibility.|`|AA12305758	he most defiantly  could have a problem smell his breath does it smell check his gums if you see nothing wrong with them and no smell feel them check for loose teeth if none probably not the teeth hes 2 year old so hes not getting Alzheimer i would think is something different something new mew bf new pet hes mad about something and trying to tell you something but if hes crewing i am thinking teeth something that's hurting him that hes trying to get to stop
PM23RDycaa	Regardless of what you friend has said your dog has had a second seizure and needs to be seen by HIS vet. That's just responsible pet ownership.<br>  <br>  you need to figure out the cause of the seizures which can be a number of things, hypoglycemia , lead poisoning, distemper, proto systematic shunts, hydrocephalus, tick borne diseases and chemical/environmental substances.<br>  <br>  He's had two within the span of 48 hours. See his vet.|`|BiiRWTZ9aa	If you love your dog then take him to the vet. Seizures are to be taken very seriously. If left untreated they can cause death! I'm surprised and shocked by your friend who was a vet and who didn't tell you to get treatment for your dog.<br>  <br>  My own dog had epilepsy for 8 years, he lived until he was 10 years old. Yes, possibly the drugs eventually got him. But this was eight years since he started on the medicine, and he lived a happy fulfilling life until the day he had to be put down. I know it is scary to see your dog having a seizure, and it is scary for your dog too, it doesn't know what is happening! Seeing my own dog go through those seizures was horrible, with medicine I could at least give him a much more normal life than he would have had if he had kept having seizures every day. <br>  <br>  <br>  Next time he has a seizure:<br>  - Switch the lights off<br>  - Turn TV/radio off - keep noise level at a minimum<br>  - Move away any objects that may hurt your dog<br>  - Do not go near it when it is seizuring<br>  - Observe the dog and TIME the seizure!!<br>  - Then call your vet and bring him in<br>  <br>  ...but I hope you will see your vet before he has another one.<br>  I know you love your dog so please do this for him. If you had epilepsy you wouldn't want to be seizuring all the time either.<br>  <br>  I wish you and your dog the best of luck!:)

Unless you can talk your mom into seeing an allergist, there really isn't much you can do.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	No - there are breeds that shed less, but if your mom is highly allergic - no cat will be tolerated.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	try to research these breeds,if they may be non-allergenic?<br>  Cornish rex<br>  Selkirk rex<br>  La Perm<br>  also,consider visiting the breeder:if your mom has a severe allergy,she may not tolerate any cat?<br>  but, it is possible she can tolerate a cat with a coat like a poodle?|`|p5CLwwtSaa	Then get a hypoallergenic cat.

798ff6d0944436a66873f343e3aaeac2aa	I hope you do not have to worry about this for a long, long time, but it's good to know what happens for the future.<br>  <br>  Dogs may either pass away on their own, or they are euthanized (put to sleep) by a vet. When questioning whether to euthanize a pet or not, an owner needs take into consideration the quality of the dog's life. If a dog is suffering and there is no way for the dog to recover, it would be time to consider putting the pet to sleep. To hang onto a dog while it is in unrecoverable pain is considered a cruel and selfish act by many. Otherwise, a dog may pass away on their own.<br>  <br>  When an owner takes their pet in to be euthanized, they have the choice of being present or out of the room while their pet is injected. Sometimes an owner cannot handle being in the room, so they leave, and the staff is usually very supporting (they always have been from my experience). The vet will let the owner know when a pet has passed so they can say goodbye and have some alone time. Sometimes, you can have a vet come to your home.<br>  <br>  After this, it's really up to the owner to decide what happens next. An owner can request to bring the pet home, after which they can bury or cremate their pet. The owner may be able to arrange with the vet to have the pet buried or cremated and have the ashes returned. When I was growing up, we were able to arrange for our pets to be buried in a pet cemetery. The owner should ask for the name and number of the services before the final day comes, so they can ask questions ahead of time.<br>  <br>  So, ultimately, when your pet passes, you can do any one of the things you mentioned. You can ask the vet to bury or cremate him, or you can ask for the body so you can do it yourself. I heard there are even pet funeral services, so if you wanted to, you could even have a funeral for him. Like I said, though, I hope that these worries are a long way from now, and you don't have to consider these options for years and years to come.|`|ydshiNrKaa	You can either bury your pet or you can have them cremated.  It is a little expensive to cremate however, that way you get to keep your pet with you should you move away from your current residence.  There are several types of cremation available, single where only your pet is put into the crematory or group where more then one pet is put into the crematory.  I did the single and it cost me approximately $300, and then you have to buy the urn so it could run you anywhere from $300 to $500.  It also depend on the size of your dog on the cost.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	They have private cremation and burials or a vet can cremate them and return ashes to you or not and or you can bury the dog. I personally believe in private cremation. I have a shadow box with my dogs footprint and a poem and a picture of her she passed in OCT. Many choices and a varied price range.|`|rA5Iyn3Gaa	Burial or cremation is a personal choice, maybe one way to help you decide is ask yourself what you would prefer when you die.<br>  <br>  If you choose cremation, this will be done by a vet, you can request the return of the dogs ashes for you to either keep or to scatter but please be aware that to be sure of only your dogs ashes, you must request an individual cremation.<br>  <br>  I have had pets both buried and cremated and i cant say which is preferable.|`|EZkKZtGxaa	just burry them
K2QwEM4raa	Different strokes for different dogs. I have four small Pom's that share my bed and my pretty and softest one will always get down and sleep by herself.|`|wStPZeEEaa	maybe she wants her own bed...if she wont sleep with you then maybe get her a big dog cage and just let her go in there without locking it, my dog doesnt want to sleep with me either but i dont have a bed for her so she sleeps at my feet...maybe you move around to much?|`|yUkFvtudaa	From experience...you're actually lucky.  I have 3 Bostons that have to sleep in our bed.  They are crate trained, but I give in when it comes to this.  It is a bad habit for us.  They HAVE to sleep and touch us all night.  My legs get cramped and can't move.  Plus they kick when they dream, snore sooo loudly, and fart all the time.  I would love to have my bed to myself, but I'm strict on everything else so I give in. :)|`|HFhNML5saa	I don't know why she does that, but I assume that you want her to sleep on the bed with you so you can get some sleep.  Try Create training her.  The first week will be tough, but stick to it.  Our dogs love their creates and we don't wake up to any surprises.|`|4AoMi1NLaa	ok well my dog dosnt sleep with me either because she has a room where she sleeps (in the laundry)she goes to sleep fine and has a dog door maybe just get a dog bed and put it near ur bed and teach it to go on there every night|`|7uznrLBXaa	Not all dogs like to sleep in close contact with others.  My Lab does the same thing - he'll only jump on the bed if I'm not in it!  It doesn't mean the dog doesn't love you.  Some dogs just are not cuddlers.
bTLwhwR3aa	Let him sleep with you Dudley is Ok, i would call him Duddles as a cute little nick name|`|bIaywrBCaa	it's okay. I would call him choco boy. I suggest leaving him downstairs unless you want to listen to him crying all night.|`|0le6RYndaa	Cute name.<br>  <br>  He needs to be kept in the area you want him sleeping all the time.  If you allow him to sleep with you now then he will get used to it.  Ignore his cries.  If you respond, you will be teaching him that he will get what he wants when he cries.|`|gJBqAXwtaa	That is such a cute name!!<br>  keep dudley downstairs it will show him that that is where he is going to be sleeping, and your not giving in to him.<br>  don't mean to sound harsh but that's what you've got to do.|`|ErjSVRkqaa	Yes, Dudley is a very cute name! Let him sleep by your bed in his crate for the first week and then gradually move him downstairs!|`|7fGG81bfaa	yeah let him sleep upstairs. omg i love that name dudley omg cute hahaha i might name my dog that too :)|`|AA10810277	Love the name.<br>  Keep Dudley downstairs, he needs to know which is his space and which is yours, if you let him upstairs now he will always want to be there and expect it. Do you really want puddles & poo in your bedroom?<br>  <br>  He won't cry all night and get fed up crying, give him a toy or something to chew to keep him occupied. Start as you mean to go on and there should not be too many problems.<br>  <br>  Good luck.to you and Dudley.|`|KtjzRptMaa	That is a perfect name!  I would let him sleep upstairs with you.  Since you just got him, make him feel at home.  Put old towels and blankets on either your bed or on the ground with pillows (couch/sofa.)  You could also like someone else said put him in a laundry basket with old towels and blankets, but chances are he is going to get restless in that space!  I hope you enjoy Dudley, your chocolate Cocker Spaniel puppy!  How cute!|`|LE7qlAFfaa	Dudley sounds perfect.<br>  def not let him sleep upstairs your just going to start something bad, plus you will end up waking to urine and poo on the floor, best left down stairs. my cocker spaniel on his first night left was ok maybe just check early in morning letting him out!<br>  if you go downstairs to often he will get worse and expect it all the time basically.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|Scq7n4dkaa	the dogs 8?where did you find him?or are you blind?o and dudley isnt that the place where the day time looks like night and its full of indians?why not call him ibiza?o and leave him where ever he wants to go he can work you know lolol im sure hell be fine just let him do what he wants also watch out for where hje wants to go toilet you may have to train him to stop peeing in your house idk!|`|mCEKMWTYaa	I think it is a cute name!  It is going to be rough for you to get sleep right now with having such a little guy, lol. Sometimes puppies will whine no matter where you keep them but maybe you should try both ways and see which one works best for the both of you!  Good luck with you new little family member!|`|1yNoO8SWaa	Id get a basket big enough for him to sleep in and put a blanket or soft towel ontop of the basket and put it near your bed|`|YKcNS64faa	Keep him downstairs.He'll get used to it,Dudley is a very cute name :)|`|z4Huew1daa	lovely name!! fits the breed very well

My second birthday fell on the same day as my agility class, so Mom took cake, and party hats, and goody bags, and the whole thing.  <br>  This is the recipe she used for the cake.  Everyone said it was the best ever.<br>  She got the recipe from the first site listed below.<br>  (The second is MY own blog.  Check it out.  I have lots of pics - but nothing from my birthday party.)<br>  <br>  Bacon Chicken Layer Cake<br>  <br>  This recipe makes a real layer cake! Chicken, bacon and yogurt provide aromas that drive dogs crazy for this cake.<br>  <br>      * 3 cups flour<br>      * 1 T. baking powder<br>      * 1/2 cup margarine, softened<br>      * 6 eggs, beaten<br>      * 1/2 cup corn oil<br>      * 2 jars strained chicken baby food<br>      * 2 cups finely shredded carrots<br>      * plain or vanilla yogurt<br>      * 2 or 3 strips of bacon, fried crisp, then crumbled, or use bacon-flavored jerky strips, cut into bits.<br>  <br>  Generously grease and flour two 8" round cake pans; set aside. Combine flour and baking powder; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat softened margarine until smooth. Add eggs and corn oil; mix well. Add strained chicken, and shredded carrots and mix until smooth. Add flour mixture and mix thoroughly. Pour batter into the 2 prepared 8" cake pans. Bake at 325° for 60 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes before removing from pans. Cool completely on wire racks.<br>  <br>  Place one layer on a serving plate and spread yogurt over top. Place second layer on top, then spread yogurt on top and sides of entire cake. Sprinkle crumbled bacon or bits of jerky strips over top. Use "Pupperoni" sticks for candles.|`|LGpv2grIaa	<a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-birthday-party-food.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/dog-birthday-party-fo...</a>|`|sUXyRlVjaa	<a href="http://www.dogbirthdaysandparties.com/dogbirthdaycakerecipe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbirthdaysandparties.com/do...</a>|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	A cake that almost looks yummy enough for you to eat!<br>  <a href="http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/viewtopic.php?t=5504&highlight=" rel="nofollow">http://www.mastiffonlinecommunity.net/vi...</a>

wq6lfHIBaa	She is a kitten, she is just playing! She will mellow out as she gets older,  enjoy it now while she is little, they are so fun!|`|vv2uk9hHaa	She's a baby, she's playing. Gently push her away and tell her no in a firm voice. Never hit her back. But I hear ya, my hands are a mass of gashes and bite marks.|`|AA11513689	because baby is a BABY, they need to learn all the things kittens learn, how to play, how to hunt (even if an indoor cat, they ALL do this), and how to 'kill' the prey!<br>  First things you MUST DO, is to lightly whap away hee claws, tell her 'NO! BAD!', don't hurt her, just reinforce that this is NOT something she is allowed to do. Do it every time, she is a baby, and needs to learn.<br>  Kittens are BORN bi-polar, they move from mood swing to mood swing, that is because they are just learning, it will stop as she grows.<br>  Either that or she will just be a terrible little brat. But, dang, that is a lot of our cats (even WITH the training! They have us figured out!<br>  The most important thing for this kitten,though,is love, and trust, she needs to learn you love her unconditionally,and will NOT hurt her (like declawing). DO pick her up, and when shes acting like 'Katara the kitten from HELL', love her.<br>  THey are cute when they are disarmed in the middle of being rotten.|`|Ql5fgVtBaa	I don't think Katara is mad at you. Maybe it's  just a sign that she's developing her hunting skills like her cousins  would do in the wild. (Big cats like lions, tigers, leopards, etc.) It's all instincts.....unless you're doing something to really tick her off. XD|`|gmkUgFx5aa	if she is like hugging your arm with her paws she wants to play! just get her xome little cat ball and play with her. i bet she is adorable... awww :)|`|0zriLTZXaa	Maybe she doesnt want to be touched. Sometimes cats do that when they are bothered.|`|HUhdXqMHaa	I have a cat I adopted as a kitten and he did the same thing all the time. In fact he still does. I tok him to the vet for a checkup and the vet said that he's just very playfull and curious. To stop it as much as I could I got him toys, and one of those laser pens to let him chase all over the place. He gets a lot of pent up energy out and is a little calmer now. But he's still very agressive.|`|c7zXAZoLaa	I know what you mean. I have an outdoor cat who has had 5 litters of kittens and almost ALL the kittens did that. DON'T WORRY she will stop. Kittens have a lot of energy and like to play with you. But when the bite you their teeth have not been wore down yet, there for they are sharp. When cats get older the teeth get wore down, and they are not as energetic so they won't hurt you!<br>  Hope this helps :-)|`|E3SKXPF1aa	Your kitten sounds a bit too aggressive to be just playful. But don't worry she will calm down as she gets older. You could try to train her not to break skin though.|`|BRNMJx45aa	OMG MY CAt does the same thing sj=he is about 16 mths|`|lW2d7m9Baa	she is still young yet and she is playing!<br>  <br>  no worries man
4ap1GPvsaa	Feeder fish are the best way to go with oscar's, they can be very nutricious for them, i suggest breeding your own feeders though because if you buy them from the store they will not be as nutricious for your fish due to stress.<br>  <br>  Another kind of food you can try is cichlid pellets, most oscars will eat this because an oscar is a kind of cichlid.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps<br>  ~Sincerly Cori~|`|fSJrgVU7aa	We've bred Oscar's twice now. We've always used cichlid pellets as the staple diet. We've supplemented that with freeze dried krill, live crickets, live earthworms, small tree frogs, and feeder fish. We always breed our own feeders.|`|nAK8bm91aa	When I first started out with oscars, I fed them Feeder fish (small goldfish) but my then girlfriend got upset so I started feeding them Krill, they eat it, its designed for them anyway.|`|25CAIGfeaa	blood worms, guppies(feeder), goldfish(feeder), the possibilities are endless. I saw u can feed oscars mice!|`|nZno3cMEaa	hi there prawns, bloodworms and pellets ( mainly pellets ) and worms are very good too|`|OnWmqs4paa	Guppies, crickets mosquito larva earth worms just about anything you can by a a bait shop for fresh water......<br>  <br>  PS - Always keep a top on your tank they will jump out...|`|h4wNRqf9aa	why do you prefer live food? It's expensive mesyy and usually deletrious to the animals health<br>  <br>  A couple of years ago when we had a pair of oscars we used to feed them live store bought feeders...<br>  After one died and the others head and lateral line looked like a pi?ata after Cinco de Mayo, with no deficit in water quality, I decided to do something.<br>  <br>  As an aside, the live guppies I used to give my Senegal bichir gave him works that bored though his stomach and right out ofhis body, TWICE.<br>  <br>  Simply put do NOT feed them live rich<br>  <br>  Cichlid pellets, live freeze dried or frozen crickets, earthworms, silver sides, beef heart, seafood medley, shell on shrimp (25-30 count), blood worms, krill, mysis shrimp, heck even nuts and fruit, mine was especially fond of pistachios|`|m0e3a3gWaa	Despite their normal and voracious appetite, Oscars are prone to a variety of problems connected with diet, usually resulting from an uninformed owner.<br>  The first is their fussiness: refusal to eat only foods which they have become accustomed. This is easily cured as long as the owner is more resolute then the fish.<br>  If the food is ignored then it is removed and the fish is left hungary until the next day. This process of attrition may have to continue for weeks, but invaribly suceeds as long as the owner is steadfast.<br>  Far more serious are the results of feeding long term on unsuitable foods,usuallyy pellets. This can result in intestinall disorders, with the fish resting on the bottom sometimes with, but usually without abdominall swelling and refusing to feed.<br>  A further problem is these fish are extremelyy messy feeders which waste cloud of particlel via the gills.<br>  This can be obviatedd by feeding them their natural food sources, raw fish, crustaceans, insects and the occasional green stuff.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	I wouldn't feed live foods on a regular basis, just maybe 1-3 times a month.<br>  <br>    Keep the oscar by its self, it deserves lots of attention.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a 30+ gallon tank and if you have a 30 gallon then you will need a filter for a 70 gallon and if you have a 50 gallon then you will need a filter that filters 170 GPH.<br>  <br>  For food just get them a Oscar or Cichlid staple pellet food and blood worms occasionally|`|igpMQn0kaa	DO NOT give feeders unless you raise them yourself, and even then, as a treat. They're very fatty (goldfish) and can cause vitamin deficiencies.<br>  <br>  I suggest Hikari Cichlid Gold, along with krill, frozen foods (not too much beefheart) such as brine shrimp, crickets and other insects from a pesticide-free area or store, shrimp pellets, vegetables like peas and  cucumber cut up into small pieces, shrimp and even algae wafers. In the wild they eat insects, so if you're going to give something live, give that. That's the diet I have my Felix on, and he's growing big and strong with no sign of Hole in the Head.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	I agree with Cory W
fkqr3o7Oaa	In the early stages of pregnancy a cat may get "morning sickness" and vomit but other then that there isn't much you can do until a few weeks when her appetite increases and her stomach becomes hard. You may sense a change in her demeanor... she will sometimes be irritable or in most cases really affectionate.|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	At around 2 to 3 weeks you will notice the nipples getting a bit bigger and pinker.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You won't tell for about 3 weeks.  I would strongly advise you take her in now and have her spayed.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	she can be spayed at anytime, even now, even in heat (costs alot more though when in heat)<br>  <br>  call the vet and make the appt.

It's safe for your 7 month old to use.<br>  <br>  Clay litter doesn't clump and has to be changed more frequently than clumping since it absorbs urine and can't be scooped.|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Cat prefer clumping litter more, And clumping litter is were the litter absorbs the urina and turns it into a rock!
pMMcEvFsaa	Yes, you would rise when the horse's outside leg (the one closest to the rail) goes forward. This makes you and the horse look like you are joined, giving a more uniform look.|`|AA12048299	"Rise & fall with the leg on the wall"<br>  Follow the outside shoulder.<br>  ...............................<br>  Ask your trainer for further explanation.|`|14PrlLjFaa	"Rise and fall with the leg on the wall"<br>  <br>  So yes, as the outside leg goes forward you go up.|`|EghHVkHEaa	When you you post up the outside leg should go "up" too. That's how i was taught to look at it.|`|x6QATdl5aa	You rise as the outside leg moves forward, because this means you are rising as the horse's inside hind leg is moving forward.  When you are on the wrong diagonal you are sitting on the leg that the horse is trying to push with.|`|C68dKT0Saa	when the outside leg go's forward rise and sit when the outside leg go's back. you will click into it like almost immediately so dont stress|`|5eu5P1hYaa	You ALWAYS move with the leg on the wall.|`|x84d9yInaa	As the outside leg begins to move forward, you begin to go up.|`|YPNdv0pSaa	Rise and fall with the leg on the wall|`|3YHZUuhyaa	yes, rise as the ouside leg moves forward|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	when u rise up ur horses outside front leg should rise too! when sitting it should come down at the same time|`|penuzN8jaa	sit when you see the outside shoulder move towards you!|`|BREi7qw7aa	ok riding on the correct diagonal is really important to keep your horse balanced. So the front legs move forward at different times. When the outside leg moves forward, thats when your up, and as the inside leg is going forward you sit.|`|HX5MdJVSaa	you rise with the horses outside leg|`|bxlYleZkaa	Rise and fall with the leg on the wall.|`|jUjkvis8aa	You rise as the outside leg moves forwards, and sit as it moves back. To change your diagonal (e.g if you're changing the rein) you should sit for two beats.
Vtl7S1m1aa	Besides Settles IN Ohio is a bunch of breeders in western PA. And some in ILL. Do not limit yourself on where the breeder is. Some will ship and as this is a rare breed you may have to get on several wait lists and just wait for a pup to be born. Litter sizes are very small. Think 1-4 pups rather then 5-12 pups.<br>  <br>  But first I suggest you get to meet these dogs. They are cute but can be very noisy and if you live in an apartment and don't have the time to train the dog to be quiet when you are out you may find the neighbors are not too happy with you.<br>  <br>  Go to AKKAOA.org and go thru their breeders list. AKK are UKC registered and shown. This is a rare breed so expect to pay no less than 1500.00. Some breeders do have slightly lower prices but not by much.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA10599589	Jess' post is pretty much right on with the prices they listed for the AKK.  I would have serious questions about a supposed purebreed AKK going for $300, unless of course it was from the Alaskan Klee National Rescue group. Or from a breeder wanting to rehome or retire one of their dogs.   AKKNR's website is listed below.<br>  <br>  There is an AKK breeder in Ohio, their website is listed below.But as was said this breed is still very young and rare, so usually they are sold for thousands, not hundreds.|`|qag0plj7aa	umm no check dogbreedinfo.com. kleekais can be expensive, starting at like 300 for the cheapest|`|DUOwF59paa	I have an alaskan klee kai and they are NOT cheap, they range in price from $1500-$2500.

AA11658729	Hello <br>  I have a rabbit my self and he runs off if i leave the cage open or if he is out in the garden and i go inside to get a drink i will go out again and he will be gone.<br>  i have just asked my dad and he said cut there nail shorter than normal  in your garden is there any where he/she can get out or do they just dig hole and get out that why><br>  if they do get out through a gap somewhere fill it up or go to a d i y shop and get some meshing and put it i front of the gap that is wot i did and he does not run off any moe unless he get out the front way <br>  if this has not been much help than i am very sorry|`|qMO9S6kvaa	Rabbits are wild animals, they just want to be free and eat what they choose. if you do not want them to escape, extend the cage 2-3 feet below the surface of the ground. it'll take them a while to dig through that. of coarse it will take you way longer to dig yourself but at least your rabbit wont dissapear.|`|QuUoDkBLaa	Most rabbits do this, remember it's in their genes to dig to make homes and to run wild.<br>  Try putting bricks around the perimeter of your garden so they can't dig under fences or buy a pen to put them in during the day.|`|o74xFiyyaa	There going to travell my friend <br>  <br>  They ruin ur garden <br>  then ruin ur neighbours next thing u know they'll be ruining the prime misters garden<br>  <br>  put it this was to them ut next dorr neighbour has chocolate. they ate all urs|`|YvvG1qnyaa	It doesn't like you|`|lVKwnFvjaa	Maybe they figure they're old enough to leave home; but not so far away that they will truly have to fend for themselves.

683d3c2192385bf25fb38d1cc4aadeb9aa	One suggestion may be to get littermates... I occasionally sell littermates to one person (if I feel they are responsible enough to handle it). The puppies are already bonded, have similar personalities and habits, and they already know each other. Plus, they are on the same level of training. If you get a puppy from a responsible breeder, there won't be many bad habits for them to teach each other.
RDcwT7YEaa	I have to dogs who were obviously brother and sister they were strays and came to my home. They are very bonded to each other but to my husband and I also. But they love me more. :) I have four dogs total and I find them to be no more trouble than one|`|NAGiNKFWaa	After reading this, I don't suggest you get any puppy.  It sounds like you do not know how to care for one puppy, let alone two.  I think you need to do a lot more research before you get any sacred puppy.|`|LGpv2grIaa	Despite being the epitome of cuteness, puppies are a big commitment. Turning these jumping, chewing, nipping, yipping, piddling, pooping little creatures into well-behaved dogs takes a good deal of time and effort. <br>  <br>  Raising a puppy is a big commitment. To make sure your pup grows into a dog who's a joy to live with, you need to give him lots of attention, training, and socialization to people and other dogs. Without this care, your pup may develop behavior problems that are hard, or even impossible, to treat.|`|dObUr8pWaa	I think one puppy is fine. Everyone could divide the duties. One puppy is much easier to handle than two puppies because they can make a big mess and if you get two you dont want twice the mess.<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED!!!|`|xzC0IW8Faa	2 that if your not always there they will have some one to play with|`|Tb4sPcehaa	If you are commited to getting two puppies you are going about it the right way.  It looks like you have done your education.  It's best to take them to two different classes if possible, if in one class together have them across the room from one another.  Go to a trainer who is well versed in raising siblings.  Ask the trainer hard questions to make sure they are aware of the challenges. But with that said, it is best to not get two puppies at the same time.  It can lead to them still bonding too closely to one another and not responding to humans as the pack leaders.  Plus it's more than twice the work.<br>  <br>  I am not sure why the one poster said you are not ready for a puppy.  It sounds to me like you are ready to me.
n4pNNcGfaa	Why is this in the dogs section?<br>  <br>  2 + 2 = 2/3 * 6 = 6 - 2 = 4<br>  <br>  Also, what would you do if the first answer was wrong?  You can't have two winners, so if the fastest (first answerer) isn't also right, you've got a problem.
oDVx7nSxaa	The antibiotic eye ointments like Neosporine are not mean for use on the eye and other mucus membranes - it says so clearly on the packaging!  There is a triple antibiotic eye ointment for eyes but it's labeled for use in the eye, and comes from the vet.  This is why medical information needs to come from a doctor, and self-medication is a bad idea.  I hope you've taken your kitten to the vet - eyes can easily become ulcerated, causing damage and pain.
zeTGmB3faa	The first cat does love you, don't think that he doesn't. Because he was blind and the dog took care of him, he looks to your dog as a substitute mom. His eyesight may still not be perfect. Some cats just don't climb up and sit on your lap. My cat doesn't and she still loves me. I allow her to be who she is. This new cat is just a lover type, a different personality. Male cats are more affectionate and needy than many female cats. If they are both altered, in time they will learn to get along or at least tolerate each other. Put one on either side of your lap and just pet and talk to them. They shouldn't be always separated. Most  house cats will hiss and bat each other but rarely get into a full blown fight. Don't worry, both cats love you, enjoy them. You have a wonderful dog that was gentle enough to help this little kitten.Best wishes to you and your furry family, and thank you for feeding and rescuing these strays.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Cats can pick their owners.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	cats are all different and like humans all have different personalities.  <br>  Yes i definitly think cats pick their owners.  <br>  I'm like the only one in my family that my cat loves.  He is terrified of my dad and doesn't really like my mom that much. Sometimes likes my brother though but always loves me, he sleeps with me every night, is always with me  and waits for me to come home.|`|AA11431152	Maybe the first kittie left its mother too early or is just really traumitized. You don't know what she's gone through. The new one is probably in good shape though. I would show just a little bit more affection to the first one or just leave it alone. He'll come around.|`|5ZrVP3Xjaa	Did you pet the cat? If you pet the cat and be nice to it, it may come to like you. Maybe put Found Cat signs all over your neighborhood and maybe it's owner (if it has one) will come looking for it. If you would like to keep the cat, just let it follow you home and keep him! If you have two dogs, big or small, there's a 50/50 chance that your new street-found cat will make friends with the dogs. Good Luck!|`|XVTCsfWVaa	They do pick their owners. <br>  I do pose your question with another question. Perhaps that other cat you saved that does not "like" you as much as the dogs. Had a bad experience with humans at one time. He trusted you because he needed help and knew in his desperate moment that a person with 2 dogs is safer than a human without. He may trust/bond with the dogs for this reason and feels calm/safe if the dogs are there.<br>  <br>  It is not a thing one likes to think about but one does not often know what baggage an animal or human brings with. I am glad you found a cat to bond to you and it gives you joy.<br>  The other Cat does live with you and the dogs so he may love you. Just not show it the way you would hope but you may be the nicest human angel he ever met.|`|2JBJdTzgaa	i believe most animals do. horses,cats, and alot of dogs. I have 7 people living with me and 2 cats. My male cat has alot of personality and tends to hide, scratch, and bite out of annoyance with any of the other family members. he has claimed my room as his and only scratches me when others around me are being obnoxious and loud, but when were alone he never scratches me and likes to sleep on my feet :]|`|yxBHqKNXaa	Well, you pick your friends, cats are individual, dogs will love everyone but cats will pick...

bnJLKQWMaa	Sounds like your dog needs to be better socialized.  Lots of walks and lots of people.  Give him treats when someone walks by, he needs more exposure to the outside not less.<br>  <br>  You need to work on this right away before he gets any older, an under socialized dog is often a problem as they don't know how to react to different situations and it is a bite risk.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|GSf09ALBaa	When you walk him outside ignore his little fits.  Keep walking with confidence and don't give in.  Put your shoulder back, keep up the pace, be calm and he will pick up on your confident calm energy.  <br>  <br>  Be the leader.|`|riCfCxjEaa	Your dog is fearless when he is at home because that's his turf, outside, he feels more vulnerable.  My advice is to get some high value treats (small bits of cheese, hot dog, etc. nothing crunchy but smelly and soft) and enlist a few friends to help you by approaching while out on a walk, have them drop treats as they walk by but ask them not to talk or give the dog eye contact.  another thing to try is when you see a person approaching, get your dogs attention by getting him to sit and look at you with the treat and treat the dog like crazy as the person walks by.  I would stop the dog some distance away from the person and try not to let the person walk right next to you.  You want your dog to feel comfortable with people at a distance and to relate people with good things like chicken, cheese, hot dogs.  As he gets comfortable you can move closer but go slowly and have patience.  Luckily, your tackling this early and it's very fixable.  If you need help, I would contact a good trainer.  To find one in your area, visit APDT.com.  Good luck!|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Your dog needs socialized. Take the dog on rides meet new people all you can it is a little late in his life but they learn..have some people walking by hand your dog a treat yu will carry and when in front of the house when the dog acts aggressive tell him it is "Okay" or whatever term you want to use and move along in another direction.|`|NTR6LnZSaa	all your problems can be solved by walking. shorten up your leash,make sure he heals,and show him that you are in charge of the universe(at least fake that you are).after some time he will be less apprehensive out in public.dont make stops at first. dont let him pee every ten feet.walk walk,walk|`|EZkKZtGxaa	take her for more walks|`|uKpkOss0aa	One way to get him to see people as something positive is to give him some pieces of chicken when he sees people walking or jogging by outside.

AA10289917	Yes, she is jealous.  My dog is that way with me and my cat.  Animals have these feelings!  Their meows are their only way of communicating, when us humans don't get their message!  <br>  <br>  Try to be equal to the two kittens.  Eventually they will get along.  Even prefer this kitten for a while if she is still meowing.  You want them to get along, so do everything in your power to get them to this point.  Feed her first!  Cuddle her first!  But always follow with the other kitten.  Then back to her.|`|AA11431152	The same thing happened to my cats. My first one always hissed at her brother. But 2 weeks later, she wouldn't get away from him. She loves him now. Your cat is probably being territorially or your nw cat is being mean. She'll get used to him don't worry. Give them a couple weeks, and if they continue just email m at youmnagabr@yahoo.com. But she might be a little jealous too but i highly doubt that|`|HJiBFsewaa	you really shuold have broguth them together because the white cat probably thinks that this is its terrritory. and maybe it is jealouse but cats dont meow out of jealously maybe she is hungry?|`|wq6lfHIBaa	She can just be scared, a week is maybe not long enough time for her to get to know and feel safe in your home, give them some time and they will be fine!
XVTCsfWVaa	Of all the things I have read I found gently spraying with a water bottle works if they are on it. You have to constantly do it for they will test to see if you follow through. It may go on for months but will work in time. <br>  <br>  Also if you have & can tolerate (cotton balls soaked in vinegar in bowls on table) You do have to freshen them up every day or two. That worked for the top of our TV since I did not want to spray water near electricity.<br>  <br>  Good Luck they can be stubborn and curious some days.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Scold them whenever they hop on it. Pet stores also sell a mat that zaps them when they hop on it.|`|KEIQix4Maa	Get rid of the cats.|`|5ZrVP3Xjaa	Put some meat or whatever your cat likes on the floor and it'll jump off the table. Cats aren't like dogs, so it'll never learn no matter how many times you scold it. Don't get frustrated a lot and don't smack the cat and yell at it like your going to kill or send it to the pound or anything. Be nice to it and do what I said above or you will end up angry. Take your cat off the table immediately if there's food on the table!|`|mgdkr6hvaa	Everytime they go on it push them off.  Eventually they will learn.  If you have a spray bottle, then you can use that with water to teach them too.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Spray them with water (a gentle spray) whenever they go there. Eventually they'll learn.

dlqa6yFkaa	Australian Silky Terrier, Boston Terrier, Poodle just a few off the top of my head.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	All dogs shed.  Every hair on their body has to fall out at some point & grow back.  <br>  The breeds that are named as being non-shedding means they don't have the typically twice a year shedding period. Instead they lose hair year around & require more constant grooming & professional grooming. There are no dogs who have hair like ppl. All dogs have dog hair not the same as ppl hair.<br>  For those who haven't seen hairless breeds in person - They do have hair - very small amounts but they do have hair & do shed. None are 100% hairless & lil bits of hair on their head, feet & tail.<br>  <br>  If you can't handle having dog hair in the home or on your clothes, you won't be happy.|`|01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	all dogs shed... <br>  Yes even the ones that are said not to...<br>  I think the most common one is the poodle. But they also shed...|`|SMtTONPQaa	uh i think all dogs shed,but sometimes you tend not to see it try a breed with really short hair that should work.|`|20fqa5hCaa	All dogs shed, but there are dogs that have hair like human instead of fur.  These dogs shed about like humans.  They don't leave hair all over the house, but hair will come out in the brush and occasionally you might find a little ball of hair on the floor.  Portuguese Water Dogs are one of these breeds.  I have two of them (one curly, one wavy) and I do not find their hair all over.  There are a number of breeds like this and I've put a link below that you can look at.  These dogs all tend to be "hypo allergenic" meaning they don't "tend" to irritate allergies, but they can.  If it is allergies, more than hair, that concerns you, there is one breed that does not produce dander at all and that is the samoyed.|`|lNzhglLFaa	Bichon frise and hairless ones|`|tcV7KsYZaa	cockapoo's dont shed at all|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	poodles and a bichon frise!|`|im3vWyv6aa	I never see hair floating around my house from my Miniature Schnauzer...<br>  <br>  :0)|`|PM23RDycaa	ALL dogs shed, some less than others. <br>  <br>  Minimal shedders are dogs wil single coats most often, small breeds with "hair", poodles and other breeds with poodle like coats such as the Portuguese Water dogs, however many of these breeds need LOTS of grooming.

kbajDcJlaa	She doesn't think she is the pack leader she is the pack leader. First, after 30 years of breeding German Shepherd dogs, I have learned they eat what they are given. Does she go into the freezer for those ice cream sandwitches--or does she tell you to go fetch?<br>  Someone let her think it is okay to sleep in bed. Who was that? Although, personally mine all do, but that is my choice and if it is hot I tell them to get down off the bed. She is likely eating sneakers out of BOREDOM. Try getting her appropriate toys and spend at least 30 minutes twice a day walking her. You have never been in control. There are thousands of great dog books out there. Start with Cesar Milan's first book--yes you trainers-I know he is a behaviorist, not a trainer so don't get your undies in a bunch. You are not trying to get her to be "submissive", you are teaching her to be well mannered--so get going.|`|AA12111573	nope sounds like your dog has taken over as queen of the house lol<br>  it is probably a pack leader thing, everyone should stop feeding her people food and if they do give it to her make her be a good girl or she won't get it. like make her sit and stay no running around acting crazy. (icecream is not good for dogs it stops up the digestive tract, they have doggie icecream out now it has protein and lots of goodness for your dog)<br>  tell her she is bad when she chews up things that aren't hers, put her in a timeout place when she does this. I know that sounds crazy but it works for mine when she gets crazy. you don't have to leave her for a long time (unless she isn't getting the point then add a minute or so to the time) maybe like 4 minutes. as far as sleeping with your mom, your mom will have to take control of that situation and tell her to get down and don't let her back up. I know it's sad but if it is causing a problem then ya know ya gotta do what you gotta do. Once your dog realizes to be submissive you can give her treats and let her lay in the bed every once in a while sorry about your doggie issues I hope that helped you in some way and good luck|`|ZTZBItU0aa	In dog obedience they would say that the WHOLE family has to do the same thing, that is 'be consistant'!  Since no one has agreed on what to allow or not allow, ther'es not much you can do.<br>  If the whole family is willing to take the dog to obedience, you ALL would learn alot. <br>  Dog eating human food is SO BAD for her health. Human food acts differently in a dogs system. But so many people ignore that.<br>  I let my dog sleep with me  too, he sleeps anywhere he wants on the bed. That's a personal preference thing.<br>  To keep a dog from chewing your items, you have to provide the dog with an alternative (chewies, rawhides, bones, toys) and scold the dog with a loud and firm "NO!" immediately when dog is actually performing the function of chewing on a 'no-no' item, and then give the dog the appropriate chewy. THIS has to be consistant, it has to be done the same way every-single-time.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	I sympathise with you, My Mum has a maltese that is exactly the same but I don't have to live with them.<br>  <br>  So, it's your Mum's dog and your Mum's house and if she does not have a problem with the way things are you are wasting your time trying to change anyone.|`|7TKRtDanaa	kennel girl is right, I learned so much from just watching cesar.

Pao1xVggaa	Yeah, he probably does not want to touch the dirty litter.  They are funny like that.  My cat has a littermaid so the litter should always be fresh, but he still scratches the wall instead of the litter.  Maybe it just makes a nicer sound.|`|8v5ZtvF2aa	most cats scratch other things as well as their... poo<br>  <br>  maybe hes not ashamed of his leftovers haha in a kind of "look what ive done" way|`|WqGxGJkbaa	A cat who does not cover up its "deposits" is more of a territorial cat than one who spends ages scraping around throwing litter over it.  In the wild the more territorial cats will leave their droppings in full view to act as a warning to other less territorial cats that they are around.  <br>  <br>  I'm afraid your cat will probably never change as it is in his character. He does not have a problem - its called nature.|`|x3VqcTjCaa	He's a cat. Thats his main problem. I had two cats. One day, one of them decided to stop using his litter box all together.  For no apparent reason at all... No new pet, no new kid, no new litter or box, no move.  Nothing at all changed, just one day he decided that maybe taking a dump outside the shower door while I'm showering might be cool.. Or maybe on my bed before I go to sleep.  Why? Because hes a cat.. Now I have one cat and my brother in law has one cat.. But it gets better.  The other cat now craps on our bed too.. See the problem with him is,,, hes a @#%$%&!@#! cat!!<br>  I hope this helps..<br>  <br>  Oh and my brother in law just came over the other night. He said the cat I gave him... it crapped in his chair when he got up to get somthing to eat... isn't that nice?<br>  <br>  Just be happy he's still going in his litter box. Cause your gonna miss it one day.... <br>  <br>  Jeez I sound a little bitter huh?|`|TwVd0etQaa	Our cat used to do that, the vet told us it was her way of saying 'Look i've used the box and not the floor' then she suddenly stopped doing it lol
im3vWyv6aa	Our kids have never been without a dog... so any age is good really. As long as YOU are ready to be responsible for one as well.<br>  <br>  Best wishes...|`|PM23RDycaa	The right age is whenever the PARENTS decide they want a dog in the family and haven't been guilt tripped, begged and nagged into saying yes.|`|AA12041870	When they are old enough to scoop dog poop without whining about it, old enough to pay the vet bills, buy the dog meds and food.  They need to be able to bathe the dog, walk the dog, and do whatever else the dog needs.  Otherwise, it will be a family pet and a family affair that mom will probably be responsible for, even though the child promised to take care of everything associated with the dog.|`|Bm3vyuNpaa	Any age is right if you think she has the responsibility. I would ask her what she would do to help, whether it is feeding him, playing with him, bathing him, grooming him, walking him, etc.  Now just remember, you'll probably be the one to pay for what he brakes, supplies, and vet bills.<br>  :o) hope I helped! <br>  <br>  Alex|`|bIaywrBCaa	about 8 yr old when they are old enough to accept most of the responsibilty of caring for one.|`|7fGG81bfaa	i got mine at 4 as a birthday present. shes 8 now, i bought her at 2 months old|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Well you need to research dalmatians and the reason she wants a dog, and in particular that type of dog. If most of the responsibility especially financially falls on you and you can afford vet care and so forth then I would say 9 yrs old. If you expect her to be responsible for most or all then she needs to be at least 16 and able to work. So many variables in this question.|`|IMa9kGZraa	Ok. I am 12 years old and have 2 dogs but that's only because i was raised around them! If your daughter isn't organized then i would say a dog isn't a good idea! don't tell her this but if she keeps her room clean for a week without you nagging her then shes maybe ready. now the dog's size is a matter too! If you have a small yard then maybe a dalmation isn't the right dog. I would try a smaller dog like a jack russel. Make sure she can balance school, the dog, and family before you buy her the dog! and please don't threaten to send the dog to the pound when she isn't good because that is just so sad!|`|2qVcpkF3aa	I think they should have a steady job, have more resonsibilities like a cell phone bill. They can drive just in case the animal needs to go to the vets. They can pay for a good qaulity dog food, the vet bills, treats, toys, and possibly grooming bills as well. So maybe 16 or 17.<br>  <br>  I got my husky when I was 16. I had a job and was starting to drive. I have paid for every single vet bill, dog food, toy, treats and one grooming bill (he was bathed). In medical alone I have put out $2,000. I am now 19 and I still have Dakota. <br>  <br>  Any kind of animal is a huge responsiblity! When your daughter shows you that she's ready then go foward with it. Good luck!!|`|YKcNS64faa	10 yrs old is when i picked my very own dog so i think about 10+ they'll be able to handle the responsibilities of a dog by then.|`|sj902Wyuaa	what does your son want?
ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	Most toy breeds attach themselves to one person and will violently oppose anyone who comes near them.  He's guarding you because in his mind, you belong to him.  You have to teach him that your husband outranks him.  When he bites at him, put him on the floor, or in another room, and tell him "no" firmly.  Do it every single time he shows your husband violence.  Eventually he'll learn that to be near you, he must also be near your husband.|`|0le6RYndaa	It's a dominance issue.  He thinks he's higher in the pack than your husband is.|`|xzMfrcPvaa	Your dog is probably really attached to you and hasn't really connected with your husband. Try staying away from your dog and letting your husband go up to him by himself. Does he show any signs of aggression when you're not there, or is he calmer? If he still shows aggression, you should use the chicken method, where whenever your husband passes by, he feeds him chicken. You should also let your husband feed him. Dogs usually warm up to people that feed them. Try stepping out of the way and letting your husband and your dog connect.<br>  If your dog is calmer with your husband without you around, he probably is showing dominance. When your husband is around you with the dog, your dog is trying to tell your husband to back off and tell him that you belong to him. To solve this problem, when your husband tries getting near you with the dog, he should turn around with his back facing you while he approaches. That way he doesn't seem like such a threat. You should also still use the chicken method as well. Have your husband hold some pieces of chicken while your dog is in your arms. Have him show the chicken to the dog and slowly approach him. Then when the dog is comfortable with him there, have your husband start feeding him the chicken. You should keep practicing this until your dog begins to connect your husband to good things. Also, another way is to put him on the floor when he misbehaves towards your husband. Do this every time he tries to attack and eventually he will learn that if he acts this way, he won't get what he wants.<br>  Good luck!

vv2uk9hHaa	If your cat goes outside (which is always a bad idea) it could be a tick. Those are bloody irritating, not counting all the diseases they carry. Otherwise it might be a tumor, yes.  Or a bad infection. And cats that are not feeling well are naturally going to be in a bad mood and won,t want to be bothered. That's just survival instinct.

That can just be shaved.|`|0mb78CiWaa	It may be a ball of matted fur. Or it may be a tumor. I would schedule an appointment with your vet.
0Gyrecxxaa	Distraction would be my first course of action, just as Judy suggested. Run that boy ragged and then wait until he's in the mood to lay still and be petted. <br>   I have a two year old who was nasty with those claws. This is a cat who had no qualms about snatching a chicken bone out of your hand and taking the thumb with it if it happened to be in the way. She was vicious.<br>    I wouldn't dare declaw one of mine and she chewed soft paws off in a half a second. Don't pull away when he latches hold of you, it only makes it worse and he naturally thinks that because you "chickened out" he won. Leave the hand. If he tries to get you with the back feet then grab hold of them and hold them gently but firmly. Don't "thump" him, ever. That's hateful. If he chews on you, put the hand or the arm in his mouth further. He'll grow tired of that quickly, guaranteed. The trick is not to react, and hopefully that alone will cure him of it.<br>    Yeah, you're probably going to bleed a few times...but with what he's doing you're going to bleed anyway, right?|`|NGmRMqe6aa	Claws are part of play. Try getting him a laser light and running him until he drops. Then pet him. Get toys that keep him away from your skin. Try a fish pole with a fake mouse on the end.  Last but not least use a skin lotion he does not like. Try one that smells good to you but has a bitter taste. When he gets to rough stop the play. When he draws blood let him smell it then leave. If the smell of  your blood can be associated to the loss of you attention he can be trained to stop..|`|WJAM199Waa	First at 8 months he is still a baby and has a lot to learn. He is also a boy and boys are more outgoing and rougher than girls. (Just like humans.) I can usually tell what sex an animal is just by observing it.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you need to teach him and the way you do that is by gently correcting him EVERY time he uses his claws on you. You can tap his paw that is doing the scratching and if his claw is hooked on you, you remove it while tapping it and saying NO!. Or you can tap him on the forehead.  Always say NO when you do this.  You don't have to scream it. Just be firm. NO. These are taps NOT hits. Only about as hard as when you hit computer keys OK. <br>  <br>  This will take a while to get through to him since he is so young (and a boy!). Be patient and consistant. Also note the longer you play with him, (in one play session) the more riled up he gets so the more likely he is going to claw you and claw you a lot more.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Spurting him with water might help stop him rough playing, but it is not going to calm him down...  Bopping him on the paws is also not going to help him get comfortable with handling them!<br>  <br>  I'd guess you might have to go for doing it a claw at a time, over a few days!  If you are waiting for the post, start getting him used to you handling his paws, as it's a very personal place for cats.  Don't try and hold them, just wait till he is reasonably calm, maybe snoozing.  Start stroking elsewhere and work down to gently massaging the bottom of a foot with a finger.  Many cats love this once they get used to it.  If he starts to play you could also try gently pinning him with a couple of fingers on him: look at videos on YouTube of cats playfighting and you'll see how they do it with an outstretched paw.  I don't think this would work for long though...<br>  <br>  When it comes to putting them on, it might help to have a toy handy that he can kick/bite as a diversion to doing it on you.  Since he loves playing with water, you might also try putting some on on the draining board with the tap running...|`|V3OOBr9Qaa	everytime he  uses is claw on you thump him on his feet ,he will understand it hurt and tell him it hurt everytime .they play dumb but they are very smart pet good luck|`|m0a7Ox1maa	Ah the joys of Deafies - Bowie the deaf wonder cat is a white odd eyed deafie<br>  They do seem to play rough.  When Bowie would bit my hand I would push gently into her mouth.  She would chew my fingers so I would keep them in her mouth - they do learn<br>  <br>  Also neutering will calm him down if he isn't already<br>  <br>  Age - they do grow out of it<br>  and never EVER use your body parts as cat toys - toes, fingers, arms, the cat needs to learn they are not a form of entertainment<br>  <br>  I would use distraction, get a laser pointer and get him going with that when he starts to play rough OR put him in time out - locked in a a bathroom for 5 minutes was the worst punishment for Bowie.  (5 minutes was about it)|`|WqGxGJkbaa	You need to remember that at 8 months old he is still really a kitten (just).  Any reaction to his rough play will provoke further rough play as you are giving him just what he wants - attention!  If at all possible you should not react in any way.  If he bites - just stay still and he will let go.  If he scratches - walk away and don't pay any attention to him.  He will soon get the idea that rough behaviour is no fun at all as his "friend" simply gets up and leaves.  <br>  <br>  When you play with him you should only ever use rod toys and never hands.  If you have not yet had him neutered, this should help to calm him down a bit as he is getting to the age where he wants to get out and about to find a mate and he could be getting frustrated and is taking his aggression out on you.
WsMMHEjDaa	It would depend on whether or not you are going to keep them in a community tank or species only tank.Since tigers have a natural tendency to be fin nippers, I would keep them in a species only tank .A school of at least a dozen not only allows them to show off their natural behavior, it makes for an extremely active tank and a very pretty sight. I prefer cherry barbs. They are more peaceful than the tigers and the intense dark red color of the males when breeding is fantastic. Either way, you can't go wrong|`|vy8SRHxlaa	tiger barbs by far. You could mix them but I prefer the look of a school of tigers, 10 is a good number to start with if you got the room.

When he would get drunk, he would call me all kinds of names - he'd hit me - and he'd even throw my cat out on the streets (because he knew that this upset me more than anything).<br>  <br>  I found this kitty while I was living up there (her name is Ziggy) - she was a stray, and she came to my back door one day begging for food, so I fed her and she just never left!  She is my heart, i love that girl more than anything.  He would kick us both out of the apartment in 0 degree weather - he would throw my cat back out onto the streets - he was doing this to hurt me.<br>  <br>  I thought I loved him- but it was more of an ENTRAPMENT.  You need to get out of this relationship - I really feel for you, because i've been through this and I know the outcome will not be good for you.<br>  <br>  So I moved back to Long Island- with my cat - and I made a promise that I would never let anyone treat me like that ever again and I would never let ANYONE disrespect me or my cat.<br>  <br>  Have some respect for yourself and dump this guy<br>  <br>  You need to leave him.

32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	I actually knew a very wealthy and neurotic lady in Canada who owned a female chimp years ago.  <br>  <br>  She had to have $100,000.00  in a special escrow account for the chimps future and ongoing veterinary/medical fees before she was issued a license and permit to own the chimp.<br>  <br>  After a few years, I only saw the chimp once when it was young and cute, the chimp was sadly euthanized due to aggression, biting, attacking and other behaviors.<br>  <br>  Very sad as it could not be placed in a zoo as it could not get along with other chimps but also could not get along with people.  The human imprint combined with being a wild animal excluded it from life with anyone, anywhere.  Very sad.<br>  <br>  You better be real rich if you want a chimp.  But then again it will only be alive a few years or so as they simply cannot exist in homes with people very long.  It's a death sentence for the poor animal.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No and it's is danger to have any type of wild animal for a pet!|`|Bw18seFqaa	If you dont know where to get one.. you havent done enough research on their care.<br>  <br>  A chimp will cost at least $50,000..  not including exotic's licence, vet exam, the cost of shipping, the paperwork to ship it in, containment, etc.<br>  <br>  Primates do not make good pets.<br>  <br>  For one, they can be aggressive.. you cannot "train it out of them".. its part of their social structure and how they communicate. Primate owners often get bite, scratched, pinched, slapped, etc.. Im not suprised the chimp attacked its owner. Chimps are strong enough to break an adult's arm.<br>  <br>  They can carry nasty diseases, including hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, herpes, etc.<br>  <br>  They cannot be housebroken.. you cant expect them to keep a diaper on. Primates also do disgusting behavoiurs like throwing food and poop, masturbating, drinking their own urine, etc.<br>  <br>  They need mental stimulation, constantly. Otherwise a bored primate becomes very destructive.<br>  <br>  They are expensive to take care of. You will need an exotics licence to own one.. and many areas outlaw primates period. They need special vet care.. a zoonotic vet is not easy or cheap to come by. They also have special diets.. its not all bannanas!<br>  <br>  <br>  They are not like having a child. Primates are constant care and supervision. They can easily live up to 30-40 + years. Once you commit to owning a primate you are its caregiver for life. They wont adapt to a new owner, not even an experienced primate owner. You pretty much cant plan any vacations or weekend trips because your primate relies on you to care for it. And zoos do not ussually take unwanted pets.. they often lack the proper social skills to introduce them to other primates.|`|14PrlLjFaa	Don't worry about the price, or where to get it.

You need to check your state, county, township and city laws.  <br>  <br>  Do your local laws require you to have a permit, a certain amount of experience, or certain caging?  <br>  <br>  Have you researched to see what their diet needs, caging needs, enrichment needs, vet needs and personality are?  Also remember that chimps are very expensive to purchase.  <br>  <br>  Are you willing to commit to a chimp for the rest of its life, which is about 50 years?<br>  <br>  You must be able to answer yes to all these questions before you are ready to find a breeder.|`|eL268hETaa	Ask the lady who was just hospitalized from having that pet chimp rip her face off.  I'm sure she could tell you where to get one.<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be unless you live inside Lion Country Safari wildlife park, leave the chimpanzees where they are.|`|divHOiLWaa	It costs more than you think. You have to get a license and pay for the animal. Also with the monkey attacks old lady, the license might be hard to get.|`|0bsXvq95aa	DO NOT GET ONE!!!

TdrgZwnoaa	We overfeed our cats too. And they haven't been getting out because of the cold weather. I just switched them to a food that they don't much care for and they have started to lose weight and become more active.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	your feeding her way too much and hopefully you didn't get hurt when you fell|`|c01eb38fba09582c78fbc7a2a19baeb0aa	Aside from the possible problem of over-eating, a ,more important consideration is, where do you live?<br>  <br>  If you live in a humid environment, like almost anywhere but the desert, or maybe California, then if you leave out the food more than a days worth, it would become kind of soggy, and your cat would no longer enjoy eating it.  And you should seal the bag the food is in also, like with a bull-dog clip, to keep the air from getting at it.  People in really dry, desert-like environments (like Las Vegas) don't have this problem.|`|HvbIE03saa	You could be giving her too much food if she's gaining weight. Try giving her a cup in the morning and then a cup in the evening. My sister had to do this with her cat in order to help her lose weight because if you set an unlimited amount of food in front of her, she'd eat it all as fast as possible.<br>  <br>  My cats though don't do that. I have one of those feeders that you can put like, 10 cups of food into and they just eat when they're hungry without getting heavy. Just depends on the cat.|`|56mYVHTyaa	You are something honey.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Too much dry food is extremely bad for a cat as it contains too many carbohydrates which can lead to diabetes in later life and it is also one of the major contributing factors towards urinary problems.  A small amount of dry is fine but a cat needs a higher proportion of wet food.<br>  <br>  Also, even dry food can become stale when left out for too long and from the way you describe how you are feeding your cat, it sounds as if you are leaving a large amount out for it and then dumping more and more on the top.  This is really not nice.  The bowl needs to be thoroughly washed every day or bacteria will be forming and the food at the bottom of the bowl will be stale and contaminated.<br>  <br>  Please look at the way you are feeding your cat and do something better for it.  Give it some good quality wet food in the morning.  Leave a small amount of dry out for it to graze on during the day and then another wet meal in the evening.  You wouldn't like to eat your food from a dirty bowl with yesterday's leftovers in it would you?|`|eL268hETaa	It is normal for a cat that has been fixed to gain a little weight.  But you make it sound like feeding time is not pleasant for you.  How would you like to be fed out of a bucket?<br>  <br>  Perhaps she's meowing for your attention?  How much time do you spend cuddling or playing with her?  Does she have any toys?  Is she indoors all day long while you're at work or school?  Do you leave a radio on for her while she's alone?  Cats meow for lots of reasons, but in my experience those meows MEAN something.  See if you can find out what she wants and provide it for her.|`|uh31vpUkaa	i only feed my cat twice a day and little treats in between, <br>  <br>  when u says bucket a big bucket popped in my mind...! geez is all the neibours cats cuming for dinner too haha <br>  <br>  feed her in the morning b4 u go school then again when you come home :)
vEsSIGfYaa	Usually when an animal who is litter or paper trained poops away from the litter-box, indicates the the stomach or intestinal upset came on so quickly and/or violently the it could not get to the litter-box in time.<br>  <br>  Also, it's possible that the mess you are talking about is not poop, but instead was regurgitated [barfed] from the stomach, suggesting that whatever eaten did not "agree" with her stomach.<br>  <br>  Even with a well litter trained pet, these things happen some time, so just clean it up and observe her more closely for a few days and if it continues to happen, consult a Veterinarian.|`|B35uXDiaaa	<a href="http://hostm.256bit.at" rel="nofollow">http://hostm.256bit.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
wq6lfHIBaa	I have noticed that female cats can act this way, mine does that too, its just her personality!  My cat loves to be next to me, in fact every min. that im home and even will fallow me in the bathroom.....but i cant ever hold her.  So the best way to bond with them is just to love them when THEY WANT TO BE LOVED...lol i love my cat either way, and i love that they have some attitude i think its cute!|`|yDKLd1T7aa	One of my cats is like that too. I've figured out to just let him to do his thing. Whenever he wants me to pet him, he'll walk up to my hand and nudge at it with his head. Sometimes he'll jump up in my lap and lay on me as long as I don't try to hold him. Cats are all different! She'll come to you when she wants your attention.|`|r4N245AOaa	cats are just weird like that, everything has to be on there terms.. sometimes my cat will just lay on me and love on me and let me hold him, then sometimes i pick him up and he starts squirming around and wants to get down.. dont look into it to much!|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Just let her be!!!|`|fkqr3o7Oaa	she might be hungry or want to go outside|`|Amkmles0aa	your cat is mad
0m6BgESXaa	....This dominance junk is RIDICULOUS!<br>  <br>  He's five and a half months old.  This has nothing to do with dominance.  This is NORMAL puppy behavior.  <br>  <br>  You know what puppies do when they're together and they're sleepy?  They pile on each other.  Heck, they pile on each other when they're awake!<br>  <br>  He's seeking you out for security and warmth.  If you don't want him in your lap, calmly tell him off and remove him.|`|6hT06oY9aa	Basically he is dominating you.  Even through play dogs will try to be the Alpha if you're not fulfilling that role.<br>  <br>  Start implementing your daily routine to show him that you are the pack leader.  He eats after you, and only ever after sitting, staying etc.  Make him earn his food, treats and toys by performing a command or trick for you.  Ensure that any furniture privileges are given only on your permission, no helping himself to beds, couches, etc.  If you play tug of war games with him, make sure you win, don't allow him to lead you during walks, etc.<br>  <br>  Make sure he understands that you are top dog, not him.|`|O9lkScYxaa	He might just be kind of a big baby and might not understand that you can't hold him anymore.|`|RQMT66hXaa	The vet told us dogs will act like this to show dominance, he is showing you that you are not the alpha male/female|`|4fRcrqDSaa	My chow mix sits on me when he is nervous. A new place or change in routine. I find it to be the opposite of dominance. I reassure him then gently remove him and give him a command like lay down so he can lie at my feet and relax. After 12 years, I think I know my dog pretty well.|`|ydshiNrKaa	He either thinks he's a lap dog or he's showing him dominance over you by being on top of you.|`|MMi4V5imaa	he / she is showing affection for you and i dont know this for sure but maybe he is being submissive to you which is a good thing.
5oHQgdThaa	Best thing I have come up with:<br>  <br>  1-Get a pair of scissors and carefully clip the snags and "loops" where the cat has pulled the threads.  They won't show as much, and the cats can't pull on the loops they pulled up, and they won't get caught in the vacum cleaner.<br>  <br>  2-Get your cat(s) a cat tree NOT covered totally with carpet -- more like Sisel (it's a kind or rope, pet store will know what I am talking about), rub it down good with catnip and when you see them using the rug, gently move them to the cat tree.  They should get the idea.  I have never understood getting cat scratching posts covered with carpet.  It confuses the cat!  Why is it okay to scratch the post which is covered with carpet, but not the carpet?<br>  <br>  3-Trim your cat's claws regularly -- and try hard not to traumatize them when you do it -- make it a part of their petting time, and give them treats when they don't fight it.<br>  <br>  4-Do NOT get them declawed.  It can lead to lots of other problems!|`|mgdkr6hvaa	well fixing the carpet you could use a sissor to cut the messed up carpet.  And spray with water next time your cat does it to teach it not to.|`|5ZrVP3Xjaa	Declaw your cat and do NOT hit your cat as you'll teach it to hate you.|`|yxBHqKNXaa	I would leave it until you find another solution to keep your cat from scratching at it, or you will be fixing the carpet daily. Remember cat nip is your friend
AzsYlqhJaa	You don't really need a company, you need someone willing to take your dog to the airport.  You need an airline approved pet carrier, too.  You should just check with airlines.  I'm pretty sure there are no quarantine requirements coming from PR, but you should check on that as well.<br>  <br>  When I moved to California I brought my dog with, but had to have my 2 cats flown out later.  They came via United at that time.<br>  <br>  When we got our Giant Schnauzers as puppies, the breeder made weekly airport trips to send puppies everywhere, though we ended up picking them up in person instead of flying them.<br>  <br>  Hope this gives you a place to start!  I know how it is to be missing your baby!
QR6JmD4Haa	Aspirin is a blood thinner, and since he has a cut (gash) on his head, you DEFINITELY should not give him it. The only thing for you to do is to call the vet and get him an appointment asap. Or, you can find a local animal hospital if you think it is that bad.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Just keep him off of his leg as much as possible and don't give him any kind of human medication.

As you can see it puts him in danger. <br>  <br>  How do you know he was attacked and wasn't hit by a car? Since you didn't see what happened and he has no neck injuries it's more likely he was hit by a car rather than an attack by another dog.  <br>  He may have internal injuries so you must get him to a vet.<br>  Don't give him aspirin. He needs professional assessment.|`|RDsZFfLOaa	keep him warm, and make sure the area is cleaned with a triple antibiotic cream. make sure he drinks and eats. she should be fine unitl u are able to bring him to a vet.|`|701d5ffe3eaae5a0107e00ee7676db4baa	I wouldn't give him anything, just keep him quiet, and get to the vet ASAP
0mb78CiWaa	It does not matter. If the cat likes dog it will like male or female. If it does not it will not like either.<br>  <br>  My cat hates dogs. We got a puppy, at first she attacked it. We would put her in time-out every time she attacked him. Now she tolerates him.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	We have a female lab and she gets along with both sexes (we also have a male and female cat right now).  I don't think it matters that much.|`|01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	Does not matter what gender the cat is. Just make sure to get a cat that is not shy. It will take to the dog better this way. If you get one that's shy then it will hide from the dog.|`|zeTGmB3faa	It is your preference. Make sure if it is a male that is is neutered and if a female, spayed, before you bring it into the house. An unaltered male will certainly spray if upset and a female can too but not as often. Depending on the dog's temperament, if you should get a kitten or an adult cat. An adult will be very standoffish at first but will settle down and be a good match to a full grown dog. If the dog has a mothering instinct, a kitten would be fine and the dog may not try to harm it. but instead mother it.. Either way, it will take a little work, but it always turns out fine with the right amount of positive attention for both pets.|`|qqeus5kCaa	get a male cat, Female cats do not adapt as well to other pets it usually takes longer.|`|yxBHqKNXaa	Every cat is different :X
5PsKGss7aa	Try giving  exercise before leaving..then right before you leave, turn on the radio or TV, leave toys out, and maybe even a kong filled with treats so that may occupy him for awhile.. Muzzle will probably make the situation more worse..|`|dlqa6yFkaa	A muzzle will not stop your dog from barking. It will stop them from biting someone or something but will not stop barking.|`|0fKQhIX0aa	i would not suggest using a muzzle while the dog is not supervised.  does the dog have separation anxiety? there are ways to fix that. but it takes a lot of training and patience.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	No, don't muzzle your dog and then leave it alone.  That's cruel.<br>  <br>  The dog probably needs more exercise and could probably stand to have some obedience training.  And, it might do well to get used to being in a crate.  If you can teach the dog to be quiet in it's crate when you're home, odds are it will learn to settle down and be quiet in it's crate when you're gone.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Is your dog bored or does it have separation anxiety? A muzzle is not good when a dog cannot be watched it also cannot drink with a muzzle on. They have air type fresheners at pet stores to help calm they also have tablets or a vet does to help calm..talk to your vet if you believe it is more than just boredom.|`|KEbDrCwxaa	PUT IT DOWN HE HAD A GOOD RUN<br>  JK JK
AA11431152	OMG! The exact same thing is happening with my kittens. They are 4 months old and are brother and sister. The vet said they are too young, but screw the vet take it up with another vet, call the cops, or just keep them in a seperate room. im sure theyll live|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes - they can breed as young as 4-5 months old.  You MUST keep them separated until they are neutered and spayed.  Call around to other vets and see if you can find one to do them now.  Vets can spay/neuter as young as 8 weeks old, but I like to do them at 3-4 months old.|`|zeTGmB3faa	First, cats don't look at it like brother and sister. But the female will get pregnant. Contact the vet and tell them that the male cat is already trying to mate with the female. If the female is not pregnant the vet may be able to neuter the male now. If she is pregnant it may be very dangerous for her to try to carry a litter at this young age. It could kill her and the kittens may not last the full pregnancy time. Time for a vet check, don't wait.|`|nl0OhbPCaa	Yes omg he will get her pregnant get him fixed, cats have no understanding of incest!!!!  find a vet who wil fix him or explain to your vet that he really needs to be fixed|`|AA11767019	Yes, he can get her pregnant, if he hasn't already!<br>  Find another vet who'll fix NOW...6 more weeks will see your female likely VERY pregnant.|`|o35cQe3Iaa	Get em fixed before they have kittens with 6 toes and 1 eyeball!|`|KEIQix4Maa	Have you looked at his sis closely?  She's HOT!!!  I don't blame the lil guy!|`|UMnAJtQSaa	Cats are not concerned about inbreeding. They are only concerned about another intact cat of the opposite gender. Get her spayed immediately. Find another vet who will unless you are ready, willing and able to care for a bunch of kittens who may have some serious medical problems. Cats are what's called polyesterus so they just keep going in and out of heat until they are bred. Basically she'll keep being ready to be impregnated until she is. Doesn't have to be by him. Cats in heat have one track minds and will try to escape to complete the backwards hokey pokey. Get him neutered soon as well. If he is sexually mature left to his own devices he will start spraying incredibly pungent urine everywhere in attempts to let the ladies know he's in the mood.
6z4RiIhCaa	acually yes i just found one here is the link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.animalactorsagency.com/cats_Hm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalactorsagency.com/cats_H...</a>|`|csDhZDvraa	Well there are animal talent agents you can go to and hire to look for modeling jobs for your cat. (pet food labels, pet clothing mags, ect) However your cat must not get stressed out or distracted easily in new places . Take him frequently out to places like petsmart to test how he does outside the house. If he freaks out then he may freak out at a modeling shoot, but if he is calm in new places then he should be fine.<br>  <br>  There are also cats shows you can take you cat to and have him registered with feline clubs. Your cat must be able to be handled by a stranger(the Judge) while on the showing table.<br>  <br>  Also you can take photocs of him and enter them in photo contests many pet food companies have on thier websites.

0fKQhIX0aa	it sounds like the dog's third eyelid is not retracting properly. is it just the one eye? he may have scratched his eye or has something in it.  you should take him to the vet and have them flush the eye.  they can also dye the eye and check for scratches.  <br>  <br>  if it is something in his eye you should not wait.  it will only cause worse problems for him and if it does not get fixed there are chances that he can loose his eye (worst case)|`|RgYuXggfaa	Are you talking about the third eye lid?

How would you like it if it was done to you?  Please don't do this to the dog again, you may have caused the  problem.  Eyes are very delicate and should not be interfered with.<br>  <br>  As reluctant as you are to pay, you now need to pay for a vet to look at this eye.  NOT an online vet. A vet who can see the eye.<br>  <br>  It sounds as though the third eyelid is irritated or infected and your dog must be taken to the vet.  It will get worse without vet attention. It is not a wait and see situation.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	sounds like the third eyelid may be up<br>  seek vet care to make sure nothing is wrong- with the eye or something stuck under the eyelid
IuYekkPVaa	Don't give up hope of finding him yet.  My feeling is that because he's an indoor cat and not used to going outside, that he's hiding somewhere very close by.<br>  <br>  It's true what aod669 said about cats using their scent markers to find their way around.  However they've also got glands on their paws which leave a scent trail wherever they walk, so his nose may guide him home.  Could you hang something outside on a washing line that has his scent on it, or put his litter box outside, as this will also help him.<br>  <br>  Cats can survive in very cold climates, and have even lived on British scientific bases in the Antarctic. However, they do like to be somewhere warm and dry, so the chances are that your cat is sheltering somewhere close to home.  Knock on the doors of all homes in neighbouring streets asking people to keep an eye out for him, and get  people to check their sheds, garages and any other outside buildings in case he has got locked in somewhere by accident.<br>  <br>  If you don't find him by the morning, call all local vet clinics and animals shelters in case someone has found him and taken him there.  Make up "missing cat" posters and deliver them to neighbouring homes, shops, petrol stations, schools, churches etc.  Hand one to your mailman and ask him to keep an eye out for your cat whilst he's out on his rounds.<br>  <br>  When I moved home in the summer, our female cat figured out how to open the bedroom balcony door and escaped sometime during the night. I spent a frantic 24 hours searching everywhere for her, but it seemed as if she had vanished into thin air. When I heard cats fighting in the early hours of the morning, I rushed outside in the hope it was her but it wasn't. However, I did spot her face at the window of a neighbour's home. She must have sneaked inside when their door was opened in the morning, because the neighbour had no idea she was there. Even when I told the neighbour that I'd seen her, he didn't believe me at first, so she must have been avoiding him and his cat the whole time.<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope that you find your cat safe and well very soon.  Please let us know if he turns up.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Awww... good luck! My dog ran away three weeks ago and was gone all night. He finally came back at 5 in the morning. I would leave a porch light on and maybe some food outside. Cats have a wonderful sense of direction and he will come back when he's ready.|`|AA11193773	You want to know something. My old cat ran away for 10 days before I found him. Just put cat food outside and I'm sure his fur will keep him warm.  He'll probably sleep under a porch or something. And last but not least, Good Luck|`|nAJ98yuJaa	HE will be fine and back when he is cold and hungry|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Best of luck finding him, I hope he's alright. For the cold, i'm sure he'll find somewhere slightly warmer to sleep. For the cars... well.. that's a lot more dangerous.. one of our old kitty ran away like that... came back the same night after being hit by a car. We had to put him down because his hip was crushed. I don't want to alarm you, but cats fare pretty badly when cars are involved. And i'm sorry to say that cats rely on smells on their territory. So if he hasn't been outside and hasn't been able to leave olfactory landmarks, he probably is very very lost with no idea where to go or where he is. You might help him by leaving something outside with your smell on it (an unwashed shirt maybe) so that if he stumbles on it he'll know he's close to home. Keep watch for him and call him often, if he passes closes he'll hear you and come see you. Again, best of luck, I hope he'll be alright.

Also, check with your vet, they can give you the best idea for your dog, based on her health and the food that you are feeding.|`|GpiRaSvPaa	First of all, it depends on what food you are feeding her. If she's eating a poor quality food she will need more, and if she's eating a good quality food she will need less. So, first I would suggest you get her on a good quality food, if she isn't already. You don't want to feed her anything that contains corn (dogs can't digest corn well at all), any artificial colors or flavors, animal digest (animal feces), by-products, any non-specific meats, etc. Also, you don't want to feed her anything that you can find at a grocery store (including places like Walmart), anything that you see commercials for, or anything sold in a vets office. People seem to like to buy their dog food from their vet, but I would not recommend that. Vets take a class on nutrition that is taught by a dog food company. So, they learn what that company wants them to learn and then they sell that company's food in their office. It's not that they want to sell you poor quality food, they just don't know any better most of the time. <br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest you stay away from foods like Beneful, Iams, Ol' Roy, Science Diet, all Purina and Pro Plan Foods, Nutro, Dimond, Pedigree, etc. And some good foods would be, Back to Basics, Innova, Solid Gold, Timberwolf Organics, Eagle Pack, Chicken Soup for the pet lovers soul, Wellness Core, and the 2 foods we have used and loved, Natural Balance and Canidae. We now feed our 3 year old male American Pit Bull Terrier Canidae Grain Free ALS Dry Dog Food <a href="http://www.canidae.com/dogs/grain-free-a..." rel="nofollow">http://www.canidae.com/dogs/grain-free-a...</a> and we couldn't be happier! I'd highly recommend it! : ) Oh, also, my husband and I were originally concerned about having to spend more money on a good quality dog food when we first changed our dog over from Iams to Canidae, but we quickly learned that dogs go through the poor quality food faster. So in the end, you aren't really spending much, if any, more for the good quality food. Not to mention, when your dog is on a good quality food there is less poop to clean up and your fur-baby is happier and healthier! : )<br>  <br>  Now, once you are happy with the food your dog is eating, I'd suggest you start out by feeding her what the bag says and then adjust it from there. For example, our dog Brooklyn weighs about 55lbs and he's an adult dog at just over 3 years old. His food says, for an adult dog, 50-75lbs, to feed him 2-3 cups a day. So, when we first switched him to this food we started out with 1.5 cups for his 1st meal of the day and 1.5 cups for his 2nd meal. We just did everything normal as far as his daily exercise and everything, and we kept a close eye on his weight. Because Brooklyn is a terrier/working type dog, he is very active. We take him on 2-3 45-60 minute walks a day, every single day, as well as take him to the beach, the park, etc, as often as possible. And because of that, after a week or so of feeding him 3 cups a day, we decided to start buying some canned Canidae to mix in with the dry Canidae. The 3 cups was really about right for him, so all we did was start to mix a half of a can in with his 1.5 cups of dry food in the morning and then the 2nd half of the can in with his 1.5 cups of dry food at night. And to this day that is still what we feed him. <br>  <br>  So, anyway, like I said, first make sure you are happy with the food you are feeding your dog, then start out by feeding what the bag says and feed her more or less from there if needed. I hope this helps you out some. Good luck! : )
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	If you're that neurotic, you really shouldn't get a pet.  There will be times your cat, dog, etc might get sick on your floors and they shed. It is possible to keep the house clean but accidents can and will happen sometimes. I am all for having pets (I have 8 cats and a dog myself) but some people just aren't cut out for it.  That's not a bad thing, it's just the way you are.  A bad thing would be to get a pet then get rid of it because you don't like the mess.|`|csDhZDvraa	Get a fish or learn to vacuum often.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You can't.  I'm sorry but if you are that against germs, dirt, etc, then you really cannot have a dog or cat.<br>  <br>  Unless you can overcome your ideas, a pet would not last long in your house!|`|Uhyu3iCbaa	You could get a small breed that does well indoors, and have a fenced-in yard for it to play in.  Before the dog comes back into the house, you can meet it at the door and wipe its little paws off to make sure they are clean.  It shouldn't be too hard to do that with a small dog.|`|nPVuj0qUaa	A dog can wear shoes. Another option is disinfecting feet before returning inside. Making a smaller pen/yard for your dog will make it easier to control what s/he is exposed to outside. Poop scoop regularly!<br>  <br>  Also, most dogs shed considerably. Investing in an air filter (better than the house one) tape lint rollers and a bagless vaccum has worked wonders for me.|`|iQZpv42raa	Get plush animals. they're machine washable|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Exposing kids to cats and dogs strengthens their immune systems just because they'll be dealing with slightly unsanitary situations. Living in a sterile environment causes tons of problems.  It's not going to be easy to keep all germs away unless the kids are living in a bubble.<br>  <br>  Let them dig in the dirt, play with the dog, find out what dog food tastes like. None of us ever died from it. We didn't even get sick from it.  The body does need to be exposed to things, just like muscles need to be exercised. It makes the body and immune systems stronger.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	Just wipe down the paws with a towel when it comes inside.  Clean regularly, no biggy.  If it ends up staying outside, I think the dog will live.  As dogs were obviously meant to be outside, else they'd be the naked ones with thumbs and reasoning.  Our dogs are strictly outside, you won't find happier dogs.|`|lNzhglLFaa	i wouldn't go with a dog then...<br>  <br>  get a house cat<br>  <br>  or a house bunny<br>  <br>  they are both littler box trainable..<br>  <br>  and don't need to go outside for any reason.<br>  <br>  <br>  and if you don't want that get a fish (fun to watch, easy  to care for, and sanitary.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	No, you can't have a pet strictly outside the house.  That's borderline cruel in my opinion.  Dogs and other household pets for that matter want to be part of a family, and if you want the dog for your kids, a dog which is kept outside and not treated as part of the family isn't going to be a friendly dog. And it will be a very sad and depressed/neglected dog.  Anyways, there IS a way to keep it indoors and have clean feet.  My mom is also a bit paranoid about the dogs feet being dirty and then walking in the house, so she has a towel and spray bottle full of water sitting at the door all the time.  My moms dogs (black labs) know that before they proceed past the foyer, they will be getting their feet wiped.  They wag their tails and wait for my mom to clean their feet.  They even lift their feet for her.  She gives them a treat after so I'm sure that's why they are so cooperative.  But I am not going to sugar coat the situation for you.  Dogs take a lot of work.  One of my moms dogs had a "nervous bladder" and would squeal and pee every time I came over since she didn't know me very well.  If you yell at her for peeing, she will only pee more.  SO it took about a year of working with her, not yelling or getting mad at her when she peed, and treating her very nicely for her to stop peeing.  I would definitely recommend getting a little bit of an older dog from a shelter. That way it's already potty trained and not so jumpy. Also you can feel good about saving it's life from the shelter.  There's something about puppies that can drive me crazy, the constant biting (teething), chewing up everything in sight, etc.  Good luck, just know it WILL be lots of work if you choose to get one, but a dog can really brighten up a home.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Well, think of it this way.. If you have young children, they are putting their hands on everything that everyone touched and it's just as unsanitary as a dog walking around. And don't tell me your kids don't touch anything, any kids will touch stuff and put their dirty hands in their mouth if no one is there to remind them to clean their hands first.(in stores, at preschool, school, etc.... the younger they are, the worst they are). And  you can buy shoes for dogs, by the way. Dogs don't like them, but....  I guess it's better than nothing. The other option being: wash the dog's paws with a pet shampoo every time he comes in the house. If you have young children, get something like a labrador or a golden retriever, they are the most resilient breeds (and by resilient I mean child-proof)
IuYekkPVaa	Make up a paper collar with a note on saying: "If this is your cat please call this number...", so that you can ascertain whether the cat is definitely stray. Place it round the cat's neck and secure the two ends with a small piece of selloptape (don't put sellotape right round the whole thing as that can be dangerous if the cat gets caught up anywhere). If no-one calls in 24 hours you can be fairly sure it is most likely lost or stray.  The next step would then be to take it to a vet or animal shelter to check for a microchip.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	If it has no collar, you can't really tell. Your best bet is to get the cat to your local shelter, sometimes they have records of cat owners with description of the cats. Or maybe the cat has gotten a chip, so they just scan the cat and the owner's file comes up. And stray cats are not necessarily dirty and in bad health, although they often look like it. If it is so persistent about coming in, it probably has the concept of house as "that great big thing humans live in which is so warm and full of food and cushions".  You can put up a poster around the neighborhood with the cat's picture and ask if anyone own it otherwise you'll turn it in to a shelter.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	If it's outside at all hours, I would not consider it owned by anybody who actually cares about the cat.  ESPECIALLY in sub zero weather.<br>  <br>  It seems socialized to people, can you find a home where the cat can have an indoor life?<br>  <br>  On cold days like this, is there a basement that the cat can be put in temporarily?  Or would that cause problems iwth the allergies?<br>  <br>  Strays can be very healthy looking, with flesh on their frame. They're not all skin and bones.|`|m7KyfJnKaa	Why dont you ask around the neighborhood?  <br>     Now you are responsible for that cat. You have fed him and given him a place to go If you were hungry and cold,would you not keep going back to the place  that gives you life???<br>    Bring the cat the local shelter, he has a better chance. Or buy a cheap collar, attach a note saying you are either taking the cat or...|`|fKYi3IJ2aa	Its hard to tell because some cats just take very good care of themselves. When I first found my cat we all though he was a neighbors cat because he was fixed but after a few days of seeing him I decided to take him in because even if he belonged to someone they obviously didnt want him enough to keep him indoors. If this cat depends on neighbors to feed him you could assume he doesnt belong to anybody.|`|DIFCuJAEaa	well we have 8 cats in side and 3 outside stray cats so if its rough not shy at all like you said its most likely a stray if its really soft and a little shy most likely its a in door cat <br>  hope that helps|`|hdELD5rmaa	wow, this is a veeery good question.........aww, I hope it's not a stray...just umm a crazy idea popped in, why dont u follow it?Wow it's probably gonna notice...good luck figuring it out though:D
1Qh9i9cWaa	You don't have to do much. Just make sure there are hiding places in the tank for the guppy fry to hide in to avoid being eaten. Breeder nets and boxes are actually not the best solution as they are very stressful for the female guppy. The best thing to provide hiding places for fry are plants, either live or fake, but there are other things you can use in a pinch as well. <br>  <br>  For example, you can take one of those nylon dish scrubber things and open it up and put it into the tank. Fry can swim through the little holes and hide in there from the adult guppies. Or you can make a "fry mop" that can float on top of the water. This is just basically a bunch of strands of yarn or thick string all tied together that you dangle into the tank or float on top of the water with bits of loose string hanging down so that the baby fish can swim in between the strands and hide there. You can do a similar thing with thin strips of fabric to make your own fake plants. Take a piece of lightweight, colorfast fabric or thin plastic and wrap it around a rock or something else small and heavy and secure it with a bit of string or a rubberband. Then cut the fabric or plastic above the string or rubberband into strips. Drop this into the fish tank and you have an instant fake plant. The strips will float and wave around and the fry will hide amongst and between them. You can take a clean, new sponge and carve out little niches and holes with a knife or razor blade for fry to duck into and then weight it down with a rock on top of it.<br>  <br>  Anyway I think the survival rate of your guppy's fry is 22.7% with that many fish so I would suggest that you transfer her if you have a spare tank... But if you don't have one you can do what I recommended...<br>  <br>  If you have questions please feel free to email me... :)|`|AraBfesHaa	That's alot of fish.  My first concern is that the tank you have is big enough to house them all.<br>  After having said that,  your guppy will have fry every month for up to 6 months without mating with a male again, up to 80+ at a time.  Your tank will definitly become overcrowded.<br>  They are cute, I'll admit that, but you should just leave them in the tank and some will be eaten.  That's population control.  If you keep them, in a couple of months, the fry she's having now will also be reproducing.  it will become unmanageable (One of my 2 month olds just had fry sunday night.  It was her first batch, so thank God she only had 16)  I now have over 240 gallons worth of diff sized tanks just to house all these fish.  I've not been able to get any other kind. I can't keep up with them as it it.  The original 2 I bought happened to be pregnant (they always are, but I didn't know either of those facts when I got them).  The next morning my 10 gallon tank was overcrowded with fry, and it hasn't stopped since.<br>  Save yourself the headache and let nature take it's course.|`|JxmJg37Iaa	yeh the fry will be ok, there isnt much you need to do apart from separate them form the other fish, however you can buy baby fish food from most good pet shops and you can give them a little of that everynow and then, just make sure they have plenty of places to hide and you will be fine
2vVT24V8aa	The only way to verify if your cat has an infection is to take him to the vet for them to get a clean urine sample.  They then can check the urine pH to determine if in fact he has a UTI.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Do you mean that your cat cannot urinate? If this is the case,the cat has a blocked bladder and he will die if you do not take him to a vet. You cannot "make" him urinate if he is blocked.If you don't want your cat to die a horrible death,take him to the vet right now or first thing in the morning.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	You ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO THAT.  You could end up rupturing his bladder.  You need veterinary treatment for your cat immediately or his bladder might become completely blocked by crystals and this can lead to death within a matter of days.  Whoever told you to squeeze your cat should be shot.<br>  <br>  Whilst you are waiting to get your cat to a vet you should try to get him to drink as much water as possible - mix some into his wet food if he doesnt drink much and keep off the dry food.|`|foWAI3KLaa	PLEASE DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!I know alot about that you don't do that if he can't go and it has been at least 2 days then he needs to go to the vet and get a  catheter .You need to get him on C.D. dry cat food but you have o get it at a vet but it really helps.
nZno3cMEaa	no disease i can think of will do that so dont worry|`|JvTF7UrMaa	probly jus its colouring if it shows no signs of disorientation not much movement then thier wont be anything wrong with it x probly just his colour, iv heard of white spot but never blue spot lol hope its just colour lots of love zack x x x
L0xlHKCeaa	I do not think you should do that.
1Qh9i9cWaa	Many people consider BGFs to be a somewhat small fish as they are nearly always sold as juveniles. They definitely do grow to in excess of 12 inches (I have one that size) so 46 galls is barely enough.<br>  <br>  They are somewhat safe with larger species: Adult Angels, Goiurams, Discus etc. or larger fish that can look after themselves. Whilst they appear placid during the day, they are nocturnal hunters and will a make a meal of pretty much any small fish (tetras etc). They particularly like midnight snacks on neons but you won't find any half chewed carcasses as that mouth is bigger than it looks and they won't leave any evidence.<br>  <br>  My neighbor lost a school of 20 neons over 3 nights without a trace so choose tankmates VERY carefully.
NmLMUOkXaa	Certain medications react differently on cats than they do for dogs. Unfortunately, the medication applied is most likely one that reacts within the bloodstream so there is probably not much you can do for him at home, most likely he will need IV fluids to flush out his system. You need to get your cat to a vet as soon as possible,  regardless of whether or not you are able to keep him calm, the seizure is a huge red flag and it can lead to death. I understand the issue with not being able to afford an emergency vet, but there are payment plans available, try Care credit, but please get him to a vet.<br>  <br>  This is from Sergeant's own website<br>  "We do not recommend using ANY of our dog flea and tick products on a cat, even if the solution is diluted. Cats are much more sensitive than dogs. Dog products usually contain higher percentages and different types of the active ingredients, and this can potentially be toxic to cats. "|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMMEDIATELY wash your cat! and get him to the emergency vet's.  DOG medicines can cause bad reactions with cats and some things can be very toxic.<br>  <br>  NEVER ever put dog medicines on a cat - shampoo, flea products, etc.  Why do you think they label it DOG and CAT????|`|oDVx7nSxaa	The fact that your friends have successfully used dog stuff on their cats simply means that they are lucky - dogs and cat metabolize things very differently, and many things that are safe for dogs can be lethal to cats.  Flea medication is one example of this!   You cat isn't sick, he's been poisoned by the flea medication.  By now hopefully you've given him a bath, but the bottom line is that he DOES need to see a vet to get help in getting the flea stuff out of his system, or it's going to cause permanent kidney damage, and possibly death.|`|PBY9MNDFaa	Please take this poor animal to the vet.  A seizure sounds awful.  Please take responsibility for your actions and take him to the vet urgently.  Don't leave him ill for any longer than he has been already.  Please.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Give him a  bath.Lather him with dish soap and make sure you really scrub the flea medication off. Rinse thoroughly.Dry the cat and then call your vet asap. NEVER put flea medication for dogs on a cat!!|`|AA10265922	you must noy have read the labrl.FLE STUFF FOR DOGS IS NOT TO WORK ON CATS|`|4rc0IqGJaa	Okay well first you need to like calm down because from what you wrote and how you wrote it. It seems to me that you are a little panicked and that's not gonna help your dog. Anyway it could just be an allergic reaction to the flea medicine. But I'm not a veterinarian so I think you need to take him to the vet as soon as possible that way nothing bad will happen especially if you think he had a seizure and that is and could be life threatening so in order to help your dog take him to a Professional.|`|8e9718a3714dc906919f4f8f94450b65aa	I agree with the others. Flea stuff for dogs and cats are different. In this case what could be good for dogs can be deadly for cats. Take him to the vet as soon as possible. Hope all goes well!|`|YEQnW9Ogaa	There is a reason why the package says not to use on cats.  Take your cat to an emergency animal hospital right now!!!|`|AA12265821	Ahh thats for DOGS not CATS !<br>  IF U DON'T WANT HIM TO DIE Id<br>  CALL THE VET LIKE FAST !!<br>  GO GO GO ...|`|Poht8MR9aa	You need to take him to the vet hospital NOWWWW!!!!!!!!!|`|V3OOBr9Qaa	not sure on spelling but try kopeptate it work on my dogs flu she had|`|NGmRMqe6aa	Bathe him right now get it off him. Use a baby shampoo that leaves no residue. Feed him water lots. Get him in to the vet as quick as you can because a overdose can can severe kidney damage. If it is bad enough you could have multiple organ failure. Keep his face out of the water so he doesn't inhale water and drown. I recommend you wash him in the kitchen sink with the sprayer. Yes people can use dog drops but the have to be diluted and your vet would know the exact formula for the dilution. I have seen places on the internet that help paying for emergency visits . And you could find a vet that will work with you to pay the bill. Try barter offer to paint his house,mow his yard weed his flowers anything to keep your beloved pet alive.
MstjbpVJaa	Yes you can keep them both together,but make sure you have Perches for the Chickens to roost on,if possible on the opposite side to where the Ducks will rest.for obvious reasons,( so the chickens won't crap on the ducks )as ducks don't roost.<br>  <br>  Aylesbury's are a good layers and ideal for the table.|`|v6coHbIeaa	If they are going to lay eggs you want nests.We never had perches and we had hundreds of chickens|`|L0xlHKCeaa	Yes that is a very nice coop
L0xlHKCeaa	Yes get a new friend for Super Mario|`|4yFDVPhQaa	go for it. but i usually like to isolate new fish and make sure they survive a few days before i add them to my old fish just in case they are carrying any diseases. <br>  <br>  cute names btw.|`|kvBdTLOMaa	hopefully you cleaned your tank immediately and disinfected it. (best way is if its dish washer safe put it in with no detergent). get a new fish and put it in a separate tak for about 3 days so you know it can survive with less fish interaction and also so it doesnt carry any diseases (if so will die in 3 days max). this is also so that you can monitor your old fish and see if it caught any diseases from the dead fish. afterward put them right in! theyll get along great!

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	With the possibility of aggressive strays, you simply must not let him walk off-leash. It's just too risky.<br>  <br>  Dog parks can be dangerous places, because you have no idea what the dogs there are like. With a new puppy, I wouldn't try your luck. Socialize him with dogs you know are more stable. For instance, do you have any friends or relatives with dogs? A great way to socialize dogs is through group training classes, so sign up for some right away! Not only will this socialize him, it will help you on your quest for a well-behaved dog. You can also contact the trainers for personal help so that they can refer you to well-balanced dogs that your boy can meet. Remember to socialize him with all dogs, from tiny fluffy ones to huge sleek ones, and both males and females.<br>  <br>  Reward him for tolerating, well, anything right now. Give him a treat if someone walks by (unless, obviously, he's freaking out!). Give him a treat if a biker or skateboarder goes by, another person walking their dog, a cat, whatever. If a car makes a loud noise. If another dog barks. Make him associate everything that's potentially scary with good things like yummy treats.<br>  <br>  For training, make sure you have several short, fun sessions every day. (Dogs learn better in a bunch of short sessions as opposed to one long session. Think of a kid bored in class, that's what it's like when you try to train a dog for a half hour instead of five or ten minutes.)<br>  <br>  Don't bother skimping with the treats in the beginning, and use yummy treats like chicken, string cheese, Pet Botanics food rolls or hot dog. Keep the rewards random, too, so he doesn't quite know what to expect. Sometimes one treat, sometimes three. As he gets the hang of it, you can start weaning him off treats so that he'll respond without them. Give no treats one time, then two treats, then one, then none, then three -- keep it random. Gradually give him less and less, but I don't really recommend completely quitting treats. It's always good to still keep him guessing so that he'll perform just in case this is the time you're gonna give him a treat.<br>  <br>  Stay patient and calm. If you become at all frustrated, your dog will only become more wary of you, and it isn't his fault that you aren't making your desires clear enough.<br>  <br>  Make sure your steps are small enough for your individual dog. You can't expect all dogs to make a sudden leap to staying perfectly. Break it up into smaller increments. First reward him for a second, then two seconds, so on and so forth. Once he can stay for a long time, focus on the distance criteria, and reward him while you stand one foot away, then two, et cetera.<br>  <br>  Here's my favorite article on teaching a dog how to walk well on the leash:<br>  <a href="http://ahimsadogtraining.com/blog/leash-walking/" rel="nofollow">http://ahimsadogtraining.com/blog/leash-...</a><br>  <br>  On walks, I recommend you carry stinky, delicious treats (like dehydrated liver) and something like pepper spray. If you are approached by a strange dog, gently toss the treats out of the way to distract the dog. Do not make eye contact, and turn your body slightly away. You can leave while the dog goes for the treats. Now, if it is an emergency, use the pepper spray! However, please, take it seriously. You cannot just use it willy-nilly, it can seriously damage a dog's sensitive nose and be extremely painful. But if you really must, then you must. With these two back-ups, you can feel much safer.|`|LGpv2grIaa	Training is the best investment you can make in your relationship with your dog. You'll need to do your homework first, though, to learn how to communicate what you want in a way that your dog will understand. Stay consistent and patient, reward your dog for getting it right and remember: you can train a dog of any age. <br>  <br>  here are some helpful articles:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/training.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/training.html</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/6-older-obedience-center.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/6-older-obedience-cen...</a>|`|L0xlHKCeaa	Follow the first answerers advice, and I am sure you will be an excellent owner, because just by asking this question here shows you really care. Good luck.|`|CooI9qIeaa	First off well done for taking in an older pup alot wont and its lovely. It sounds like youre really making an effort with him too, hes lucky. OK here are some tips, Whenever you catch him in the act, dont shout, just lead him to either a) a puppy pad<br>  b) the garden<br>  <br>  then when he wees on there or outside make a fuss. As they wee use words like 'make' or 'wee wees' in a kind voice eventually they WILL do it on command. It does take time but you seem like a lovely patient person. Dont:<br>  Shout when he has an accident that can make a nervous dog who has more accidents<br>  Rub his nose in it, that is so 1980 and doesnt work<br>  Let him watch you clean it up, would you believe they think its a game :) <br>  <br>  Routine is important once he knows he gets walks every 4 hours to begin with even if its just in the garden he will know to hold it. The problem comes when he doesnt know when hes next going to be let out. Believe it or not dogs do not like peeing and pooping indoors where they live so they will learn fast. <br>  <br>  You can also invest in a crate when you go out pop him in and as soon as you get back take him straight in the garden. Also they dont need a poo immediately after feeding just like you dont Leave him half hour and then take him out again using words like 'make' etc and praise him. <br>  <br>  Aside from that keep up with the training I dont know where you live but there is the Good citizen dog scheme and its a brilliant, cheap course. They will trun your pup into a one youll be very proud of. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, youre doing well, youre asking and youre trying. I hoe you both have a lovely life together I love my pups they are ace. <br>  <br>  M c|`|fbZjUTCRaa	i guess the best quick tips i can give you are:<br>  1. get him to ignore other dogs in public. when someone walks their dog in your direction get him to sit and focus on you until they pass. treats help.<br>  2.introduce him to dogs you know and trust. do you have family with dogs? does your neighbor have a well behaved dog? introduce them in a neutral place like the park.<br>   just always make sure your dog knows what you expect of him. dont let him do certain things at certain times, if it is a rule it means always, otherwise he will never know what to do.

She's clearly not a show quality cat.  Exotic Shorthair eyes should have ROUND eyes that are level - not almond shaped eyes that are tipped.  They also shouldn't have pointed ears.  I would venture she's not even a pedigreed Exotic.  Do you show her?  What titles has she earned?  Champion? Grand? Quad?  I'm sure the answer is "none" as she's NOT A SHOW QUALITY CAT!<br>  <br>  So why breed her?  If you want more kittens GO ADOPT SOME from your local shelter.  Any kittens you have will be that many more PUT TO DEATH.  So rather than killing some - GO SAVE SOME!<br>  <br>  The only people who should be breeding cats are reputable breeders doing so with show quality animals for the love of the breed and to better the breed - not those with mixes or non-show quality animals.

Labrador Retrievers used to be one of the safest breeds you could buy, but sadly, this is no longer the case. Obedience instructors and behavioral consultants are seeing more and more Labrador Retrievers who are neurotic, hyperactive, or dominant/aggressive. It's the unfortunate result of popularity that the typically glorious Labrador Retriever temperament can no longer be taken for granted.<br>  <br>  Providing enough exercise and mental stimulation. Labrador Retrievers MUST have regular opportunities to vent their energy and do interesting things. Otherwise they will become rambunctious and bored -- which they usually express by becoming destructive. Bored Labradors can make a shambles of your house and yard.<br>  <br>  If you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog running or hiking or biking or swimming, or to get involved in agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or tracking, or a similar canine activity, I do not recommend this breed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Bounciness. Young Labrador Retrievers (up to about three years old) romp and jump with great vigor, and things can go flying, including people.<br>  <br>  If you have small children, or if you or anyone who lives with you is elderly or infirm, I do not recommend Labrador Retriever puppies. The temptation to play roughly is simply too great with many young Labrador Retrievers. <br>  <br>  <br>  Separation anxiety. More than most other breeds, Labrador Retrievers need a great deal of companionship and do not like being left alone for more than a few hours. They tend to express their unhappiness through destructive chewing and barking. If you work all day, this is not the breed for you.<br>  <br>  Shedding and doggy odor. For such a shorthaired dog, Labrador Retrievers shed more than you might think. Their hairs come off on your hands when you pet them, and stick tenaciously to your clothing, upholstery, and carpeting. Be prepared for vacuuming.<br>  <br>  Serious health problems.

9kTejB0uaa	I know the feeling - we live on the N.Cornwall coast and I, and my hounds, are really field and stream types, not beach types.  Suggest you go buy yourself an OS map for your area because I'm sure there will be any number of local woods.<br>  <br>  As somebody said - look for the trees .... LOL|`|RDcwT7YEaa	Do not take them to a cemetery that is disrespectful.

PMBmAqkxaa	I think if its cold then you should keep them indoors, because both are very sensitive to the weather. You can find lots of indoor cages in pet shops, but because these cages are usually smaller and don't have access to grass, you have to take the animals out of the cage a lot to exercise and interact with other things besides themselves. I wouldn't recommend getting two rabbits and a guinea pig because the rabbits will 'gang up' on the guinea pig and it will be on its own. Also, taking on 3 small pets at once is a handful! maybe start with one or two rabbits but i don't think its good to have more than two in the same cage! (make sure they are the same sex - females tend to be calmer and less possessive) Also, the less you have the more loyal they will be to you, and if you give your pet lots of love and attention it will be happy wherever you decide to put it!|`|uvU5DnHcaa	I strongly recommend not mixing rabbits with guinea pigs. Rabbits grow at a faster rate then guinea pigs.

9tSIY25Uaa	I have 2 guniea pigs and there the best. Rabbits are cute but belieave it or not, rabbits are more messy then guniea pigs. Guniea pigs are nice pets because they like to be held and brushed. They are not known for bitting. guniea pigs aren't into bitting, but if they feel scared they nwwill bite just like anyother animal. Rabbits can be nice to. For both pets you need to grom them and clean there cages. A rabbit usualy needs a bit of a bigger cage then a guniea pig. the thing with guniea pigs is they need a company, so people always sugest to buy two from the litter. female female, male male.. unless you want babies running. For both they need excersise. Like i said i have two gunie pigs, though i keep them in seperate cages (they came from different mothers) you can get just one pigy but you'd need to give it attention. if your one of those people who are never home then gunia pigs and rabbits not so good. iu go to school and no one is really home, but i play with them at nght which you can do. again guniea pigs are most friendliest and cuddiest. rabbits can sometimes scartch becasue they have long nails. you just need to be careful there. guniea pigs have nails but i never het scartched, unless i'm holding them standing up (they don't like me standing and holding them) then ther claws dig into me bu it desn't really hurt. Rabbits, i'd give you more info but i never was aloud to have a rabbit. I do no some stuff about them i read in a book, if you live were its good weather outside, you can keep your rabbit outside. you can do this with gunia pigs but drafts aren't good for either critter. i really like guniea pigs. they are funny to watch. i don't no what a rabbit would do to make you laugh, my guniae pigs always make me laugh. they love playing. mine even run after a ball. Anyways taking care of both rabbits and guniea pigs are the same. They all need care. but my favourit are gunbiea pigs ( i have held a rabbit a number of times, like them, just i can't get one) oh ya size. guniea pigs are smaller then rabbits, depending on the type of rabbit. for guniea pigs there are diferent types not sizes. long haired shot curly, a variety and there all cute.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i helped|`|PMBmAqkxaa	I would have to say rabbits. I have a rabbit and they're really friendly animals. Rabbits bite less than guinea pigs, they make less noise and you can train them to do all sorts of fun stuff ( i walk my rabbit) which is really rewarding! I would think they are both the same amount of effort to keep, but rabbits do need a larger cage because they need to stretch out their legs! I've had both rabbits and guinea pigs and i find that guinea pigs tend to be harder to pick up and handle because they're genuinely more timid and want to stay in the cage, but if you are buying a rabbit make sure you cuddle it it and check out its personality before hand just to be sure its right for you! :)<br>  Hope that helped!|`|XxXvsRRAaa	Hello<br>  i think that rabbits are the best as they are not as timid as guinea pigs and they are more playful.<br>  Rabbits are the cuddliest as they usually have thicker and softer coats.

They are not as fussy when it comes to hay or grain feeds.<br>  <br>  Which do you think is the most friendliest and cuddliest ?<br>  I could never really get cuddly with my rabbits not like my guinea pigs. My guinea pigs lick my face and show so much more affection than my rabbits ever did. Also my piggies call out to me and get excited when they see me where as my rabbits never did.<br>  <br>  Which is your favorite?<br>  Most definitely the guinea pigs. They are my life. I love them dearly.<br>  <br>  ( since I kicked my husband out and kept my guinea pigs, he should not have made me choose )|`|OawkeUEEaa	Guinea Pigs. they are gental, kind, loving, and really care for the owner. you can train it, and require a ton less of work than a rabbit. when rabbits kick, they create a mess EVERYWHERE. i had a rabbit, we had to vaccum 2 times a day. and that gets annoying. also rabbits smell, well not all the time, but if you accidently forget to clean there cage one day..phewweee! you won't forget again. i currently have 2 guinea pigs. and they are AMMAAZING!!! and adorableee. so guinea pig all the way.
xGxDFcT5aa	No, no, no. It's totally normal! <br>  When my dod, Jack:) was a puppy he wouldn't wag his tail. Now he wont stop and it drives me crazy hahaha!<br>  He's probiby still nervous/shy and doesn't know what to expect.<br>  I also think it has to do with age... How old if your pup?

agh18eT2aa	My guess would be to search for something on the internet about it.  Type in agility training for dogs or something like that.  There are competitions that probably have web sites that can tell you how they get the dogs to that stage.  German Shepherds would be great at that.  I used to have one and they are very agile and have great fast reflexes.|`|nEr1NnJyaa	search on the internet for a training club in your area and contact them to see if they are starting any beginer classes soon. if i was you i wouldnt start much training at home just jumping becuase it will get confusing if you have started training weaves or something before you have a trainer! i did some weave training before i started classes and so my dog isnt as good in the weaves as she would have been!|`|oyNUUJIHaa	Being such a smart breed, I'm sure your Shepherd will love her agility classes.<br>  <br>  It's very easy to find somewhere to take her to learn, just as long as you're willing to do some digging with google. Another option would be to contact your local dog obedience school, & ask if they're running any classes. You can also enter her in ABC (Anything But Collies) trials once she's learned. <br>  <br>  Imho, you need not fill your yard with tunnels & rings! (; I live in the UK, where people's gardens tend to be alot smaller, but that doesn't stop anyone from teaching their Collies/Shepherds agility. To save money, a regular class would be your best bet.|`|3bbBBMNnaa	make sure dog knows wait <br>  find a local club they will get you started and it is best to have a teacher so you dont learn bad habits or put your dog at risk of injury<br>  if you are in the uk this site is great for finding a club some have long waiting lists so contact as many as possible <br>  <a href="http://www.agilitynet.com/activepages/clubs.asp?fldName=TrainVenueCounty" rel="nofollow">http://www.agilitynet.com/activepages/cl...</a>|`|o4trSMiHaa	Agility is great, as your dog has been up to date with full injections and is obediant youwont have much problems, it'll keep both of you fit too adn it dosent matter if its pedigree or not btw :) Some places may ask that you have a certificate for obediance or puppy classes though.<br>  <br>  To find somwhere near you go to a local breeding kennels or groomers, usually places like that have information if not facillitating it themsleves. Look on the internet type agility then your area. Look in local pet shops for notices of either places that do it or people who might know :) <br>  <br>  To get into it all you need to do is book a place, register your interest and pay whatever fee they ask for the session. Most are run as clubs but some places will give individual sessions for the right price ;) <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|oHKpy4IRaa	You should start out my seeing if he likes to  run and jump. If he does you can go online or to your local pet store to see if they have some agility sets that you can use to practice with your dog. If he starts to not like agility you can return the set and get your money back. If he really does like it then keep on practicing until he is really, really good at it. Then  you can start entering him in agility contests. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Before starting agility training, schedule a check-up with your vet to make sure your dog is physically able to participate.

You can buy proper equipment, but it's expensive, so start cheaply, by getting him to weave round garden chairs, and reward him when he does so.  Get him to jump over small objects, like up turned plant pots etc, or using two litre pots and a plank of wood, make a jump for him.  In the house, get him to come to heel, and work around your legs.  Get him to lie down and make him stay totally still until the count of 20, then call hm to the next obstacle.  Tunnels can be bought from argos (they are for kids actually) but it's cheaper to buy the kids ones than the dog tunnels.  A plank of wood with painted edges can be set up against a set of A-frame ladders, which can have another plank of wood, leading to a jump off, this teaches them to wait on the coloured sections for the required time.<br>  <br>  Have fun.<br>  <br>  Your bright intelligent dog will wow you with this.  I got mine to do heel work a lot, and it is great when you go out too - there are lots of sites online which give you hints and tips, but really, it is the keenness of your animal which will show you the way.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Contact a obedience training class - most will also train in agility or direct you to an agility training class.<br>  <br>  As long as she knows basic commands of sit, stay, come, and is reliable off leash, then she's a good prospect.  Start at the beginning and train right - don't worry about "speed" - its control you want at all times, speed comes later.<br>  <br>  Our lab is trained in agility - she loves the tunnel and jumps the best.

Whatever more you are likely to learn isn't worth the stress to the sows and pups.  Does it really matter exactly how many each sow is going to have? Of course not, when they have them, then you'll know for sure. Even the best paplater can be wrong on the count.  I've been doing this for over 40 years and can get a pretty good count but don't generally bother to go beyond estimating if the litter is going to be large or small.  If the sows are near the same amount pregnant, go ahead and let them deliver in the same pen.  The bigger sow with one will probably nurse the smaller sow's pups as well as her own

32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	1. I live in a house and have a back yard.<br>  <br>  This is a definate plus for having any dog.  A fenced in yard is even better.  Chain link is the best.<br>  <br>  2. Ready to spend time with the dog and give it company / exercise.<br>  <br>  This is also a plus.  Make sure you can do this for at least 10 years.<br>  <br>  3. I want a home dog which would also partially be a guard dog<br>  <br>  Any dominant breed will naturally be a protector without being aggressive and a good home dog IF you do the work in proper obedience training, socialization  with other dogs large and small and other people and establish a proper heiarchy in your home and life with the dog.  Formal guard dog training is not needed.  <br>  <br>  4. Should be an Intelligent breed and not the "bark" "bark" "bark" at everything that moves.. type.<br>  <br>  Got news!  Any breed can become a 'bark' 'bark' bark' at anything that moves type.  Much will have to do with your training of the dog from day one.  If any dog is overly territorial they may bark at anything that moves.  This is why from day one you have other dogs and people coming into your home and yard with your puppy and you continue this for the rest of the dog's life.  <br>  <br>  All dogs are intelligent but some in different ways.  A large dominant breed will know by your body movements, tone of voice, stance, distance from people who is the good guy and who is the bad guy.<br>  <br>  5. Should be able to train easily and not the "dumb" dog type.<br>  <br>  There are no 'dumb' dogs.  Some dogs are easier to train due to what they were originally bred to due.  Some dogs require a much more intelligent owner for their training as they were bred to be more independent.  A lab is easy to train compared to a chow.  Both are smart but in different ways.  A lab wants to please and was bred to work along side man.  A chow was bred for very different reasons and are very independent thus  require a different approach with training.<br>  <br>  6. Should be ok with members of the family and children.<br>  <br>  Again, this is largely up to you with proper socialization from the day you get the puppy, other dogs in your home and when out, small breeds, large breeds, other people both adults and children.  Don't forget about cats too.  The puppy will grow up learning and knowing that all these are ok and good.  Praise for happy times with other dogs of all sizes, people adults and children and cats.  You must also do as much training with children to teach them proper behavior around the puppy and good touch and bad touch.<br>  <br>  7. A loving, faithful and stylish companion, that would be neighbors envy, owners pride.<br>  <br>  The loving faithful companion part is great but the stylish part with the neighbors envy is out.  You may get it all in a dog but more likely you won't.  Stylish is a matter of choice and your neighbors opinion of what your dog looks like should mean nothing to you.  I don't like the look of rottweilers or bulldogs but that should mean nothing to any of my neighbors.  The only way you would have a neighbor pleasing dog is to ask them what breeds they consider 'stylish' and buy what they like.<br>  <br>  As far as dobermann or GSD that's up to you to do the research.  Both have pros and cons as do all breeds.  <br>  <br>  You could fall in love with a great, sweet natured german shorthaired pointer or boxer puppy or adult.<br>  <br>  Go for personality not a specific look or breed.  Don't rule out any breed yet.  Take your time.  Don't be in any rush.  <br>  <br>  Also take a look around at your local spca, humane society and pounds.  You may find a superior, sweet family dog that works out great for you - and it could even be a mutt!<br>  <br>  Take Care|`|LGpv2grIaa	both are beautiful breeds, loyal and protective of their family and home.

A well bred Dobe, in responsible hands is incredibly loyal, faithful, intelligent and devoted dog . Dobermanns are naturally obedient, *but* have a natural tendency to be dominant. If an inexperienced owner has a poorly bred Dobermann & then fails to train and control his dog, there is the potential for disaster. Usually for the Dobe. <br>  <br>  Are they family dogs/good with child?<br>  <br>  Dobermanns are usually excellent with children and will guard them as part of the pack to which they now belong. Provided your child is old enough and kind with animals, and the dog knows their place in the pack, they will rarely if ever see themselves as dominant over a child. Children and dogs should always be supervised, not necessarily to protect the child, as children can often unwittingly hurt a young puppy.<br>  <br>  An overview<br>  *If you purchase a Dobermann from a responsible breeder, the sire & dam of the litter will have been rigorously health tested. The average life expectancy of a Dobe is ten years.<br>  *This breed loves to work, they need mental as well as physical exercise. When they are fully grown, Dobes require a minimum of 1? hours hard walking/ free running each day, every day.<br>  *Not called the velcro dog for no reason. This breed thrives when it’s with its human pack & does not like being kenneled outside.<br>  * The breed needs firm {but not harsh}, fair & consistent training. <br>  *The average pet Dobermann would guard by barking. Only a Dobermann trained as a protection/guard dog would reliably attack/protect.<br>  <br>  Is it equally important that you can off the home the breed needs, as it being the breed you may want.<br>  <br>  I would strongly advise that you contact the Doberman Club, if you are seriously considering owning this breed, as it's an excellent source on information/advice.|`|oyNUUJIHaa	Honestly, either dog would suit you perfectly.

Kitten's play often looks very rough but they are learning valuable lessons about getting along with others during this play.

It should ideally be at least 9-10 weeks old.  Also if you have an 11 week old kitten it is still trying to settle into its new surroundings and is probably quite stressed enough already, without the addition of a new kitten.<br>  <br>  However, you have a problem which needs to be sorted.  Keep the kittens apart in separate rooms.  They should not really have met each other until scent exchanging had been done properly but you can try to take a step backwards and do it now.  Take a clean cloth and wipe it around the face of your new kitten (where its scent glands are) and then wipe the same cloth around the face of the older kitten and vice versa.  Do this several times over the next few days whilst they are apart and they should start to recognise each others scent and begin to accept it.  You should also swap their blankets/bedding around. After a few days you can start to let them meet (only under supervision) and when you see them together without any hissing, throw down something tasty for them both to eat so that they associate being together as a good thing.|`|XcVlUPJJaa	The kitten is very young it will take a little time.You have to spend time with them together.take care (hugs)

Persians are too laid back and far too much grooming (every day) for me.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	You couldnt choose 2 more different cats.<br>  <br>  You need a great deal of time to look after a Persian and a good understanding of their breed.  Their coats need regular grooming and their eyes usually need attention as they are prone to ocular discharge.  They can also suffer with mouth/kidney problems. They have notoriously sensitive stomachs so you might need to give them a special/prescription diet or at the very least make sure you are only feeding them a single protein food.  They are generally very quiet cats and can be quite aloof.<br>  <br>  Siamese are perfectly capable of grooming themselves and they never stop talking.  They can be incredibly dedicated to their owner - so much so that they often like to drape themselves around the neck of their human companion.  Heart problems seem to occur quite often with Siamese.<br>  <br>  Two completely different breeds - no comparison.|`|MGfBOuUNaa	If you are picking a cat to own than here is a better choice, try getting a mixed breed from a shelter, i have gotten so many cats and dogs from shelters and they are so much nicer to you and they almost never disobey and love you more, i had a purebred cat once to and she got mad all the time and bit me all the time, it was nice having her but i think my new cat is a lot more thankful and hasn't scratched me yet!  it also may cost less and best thing is you will be saving lives!|`|0cr5zYvQaa	i would have to say Siamese because my cousin has one and his name is sneakers hes really cute but he hates me|`|15nnW3aLaa	SiAMESE, iT SOUNDS NiCER.|`|Ow2xyl9iaa	I would say  between the two i would prefer  the  siamese simply because ot  the  persian cat  sheds all the time with its long hair  and the eyes always stain  also i believe  the flat nose causes some problems  for the  persian cat....even though the are a beautiful cat  but so is the siamese..   Good  Luck  in what ever you choose..  yes i  would also consider  getting a  homeless shelter cat  and save a life..they will give you much unconditional love  ..i have found that they are the best.....  GOOD LUCK  AND  GOD BLESS
m0a7Ox1maa	I will try to explain how I understand this pose.  When cats are in this pose it means they are comfortable and relaxed, it also means they feel safe, when they sit like this they know they are not in any danger that will require them to move quickly or to pounce.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Because it is more comfortable for them that way.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Because it's comfortable. And while yes, all cats lay like this at some point, that's certainly not the only position cats rest in. It's also comfortable to curl up, lay on their side, straight out, lay in a Sphinx-position, so on and so forth. One of my cats virtually never lays like this, he's more comfortable with plenty of room.|`|4aAhEK9daa	I think they just like to keep their paw pads warm.  I think it also supports their chest.  Kinda like how we'd prop our head up on an elbow or cross our arms behind our head.<br>  <br>  I have another cat that seems to always lay with legs stretched out - <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/luna/luna020909-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/luna/luna020...</a>  Interestingly enough, she's a very nervous cat so the comment someone else said about a cat feeling relaxed could very well be true.  Maybe Luna lays like this so she can get away quickly?<br>  <br>  I've always wondered how cats can lay on their paws and not end up with them numb.  Ever wake up and found you were sleeping on a hand?  Then you can't feel it for a few minutes till you shake some blood back into it?  A cat could lay for hours on its paws and still get right up and run off.

g0WoYhAaaa	Blue,<br>           We have a pure bred broken coat Jack Russell Terrier ( Yogi ) , A tri color. We bathe him about every two weeks depending upon the need.He is kept inside the house with our other dog , but when he's out he likes to hunt and dig for rabbits and etc. So its bath time then.<br>               We use a shampoo the vet gave us ( Malaseb)that works good kills germs and does'nt dry them out. Check out the JRTCA website too , its also a wealth of information on Jack Russells.Is yours as hyper as ours ?<br>    And how about that shedding?? Man you would think they would go bald. Hope some of this helps.<br>                                                    Take care , Rick|`|o4trSMiHaa	I have one too! But with dogs you dont really need to bathe them, doing it every month or so might upset the oils in their skin so twice a year sounds fine :) its more difficult in the winter though because you have to watch they dont get cold once they are damp. <br>  <br>  The only other time you should bathe your dog is if it has a skin complaint or other special care, you take it to the groomers, or if it rolls in somthing nasty lol which my russell tends to do ALOT. <br>  <br>  A tip is use tea tree dog shampoo or normal dog shampoo with a drop f tea tree oil, it helps keep fleas away! :)|`|ECCoeifyaa	whenever they get it or once they start to smell-maybe once or twice a month. just be careful not to overbathe them cause the shampoos, if they're strong enough, can strip the dogs coat of their natural oils and leave it dry or brittle.<br>  good luck!|`|h9t1UTm4aa	Bath as and when required. If the dog smells worse then the usual dog-smell and/or is a bit grubby, then it needs a bath, preferably with proper dog shampoo.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  If you brush your Jack faithfully, he should rarely need a bath.

yQiC58bHaa	What I've found my two dogs love it a tug toy that my mom made. <br>  <br>  Buy some felt from your local fabric store, or even from Target or Walmart if you can find it. You can buy one or two colors, it's up to you. <br>  <br>  When you get home, cut the felt into strips; it doesn't really matter how long they are. Cut two strips of one color (if you got more than one) and one of the other, or three of one color. Tie a thick knot at one end, and then just braid the rest of it. <br>  <br>  Knot the other end, and there you have it- a tug toy. Also, felt is pretty durable for the most part. None of the ones my mom has made have been torn apart yet. You can also make them whatever lengths you want, and experiment with putting a loop at one end to create a hand-hold for you.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	We do the water bottle thing too, but we put pebbles in it.  the puppy can roll the bottle around and make big noise and bite on it too.  You do have to watch them when they play with this because they will eat the cap if you are not watching.  My puppies find leaves fascinating, and we play with a piece of grass, or a sunflower,  it doesn't take much to amuse them.  We don't let them play with old slippers or shoes since they will eat your real shoes too.|`|agh18eT2aa	Just an idea; my beagle loves to grab my socks and run off with them, so if you have some old knee socks, tie them in a secure knot together and use that for a chew/pull toy.  Tennis balls are a favorite but you have to let them air out for a while because they really stink when you first open the can. The dog might be repelled by the strong odor at first.  And old belt with the buckle removed can be a good chew toy if it has no dangerous leather dye on it.  You could also use the holes on the belt to attach an old stuffed animal to it so the dog could drag it around.  My dog loves to lick wet wash cloths.  No idea.....|`|VBT3Itffaa	I have a cairn terrier--close to a westie!!Well I don't know any toys to make, but this one is easy. When I finish drinking a bottle of water, I give my dog the bottle. Make sure you take off the cap, the paper around the bottle and the piece of plastic under the cap that goes around the top of the bottle. When he does tear it up (and he will :P) get all the pieces so he doesn't swallow them. When the bottle looks a mess (and it will) toss it too. GL with charley!!|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  A lot of toys can give to dogs just be sure the safety of your pet when playing with toys.  Try to find the best toy that suits your dog. Here's more info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.elfurl.com/ui9ql" rel="nofollow">http://www.elfurl.com/ui9ql</a>
NAGiNKFWaa	Well you don't mention the age of this puppy, so it is hard for us to answer.  The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|bxlYleZkaa	She thinks you have put the paper there for that reason. Why else would it be on the floor?|`|9kTejB0uaa	Well personally I'd be thankful that she's actually using the paper when the door is shut!!!   How old is this puppy?  It takes time for her to move to the next step - ie telling you to go open the door when she needs to go.  Mine, at 19 weeks, is virtually clean in the house BUT this is only down to me making sure I put her out regularly.  She made a mistake, the first in ages, last evening when we weren't picking up on her messages (she does go to the backdoor now) and she squatted on the kitchen mat (we don't leave paper down).  But that wasn't her fault, it was ours.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way - the warmer weather is coming up and you will be able to leave the door open for longer.  By the time the weather goes cold again next Fall, she should be asking to go out (and not need to go so often in any case) and all will be well.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	you need to move the paper outside gradually, and reward the puppy for using it.<br>  I know this sounds daft but take the puppy to the door, get hold of her paw and show her how to knock the door to let you know. Praise her up all the time she copies, but IGNORE her if she slips up. NEVER punish.|`|RTCKiu03aa	i think it has been trained to wee on paper before you got it and associates the paper with this|`|8ChAefLOaa	probably
d72ef12f5883f752fe3361eaaa2d3ce9aa	You should lock them in their coop for 24-48 hours. Then yolu should keep them in their pen for at least 1-2 weeks (I'd go with 2 weeks to be on the safe side) and then you can let them out! <br>  <br>  Thanks for letting them free range :D<br>  <br>  They will be happier!|`|AA11569882	Give them time to get in their routine.  When it becomes dusk they should go inside to sleep, so once they are doing that maybe three nights by themselves, then it could be time to let them wake up the next morning without a run.  Keep the food where it was before though, you have to get them used to the idea that their food is where their house is, just so they won't wander off too far.<br>  <br>  Make sure the garden is secure though of course, and it's a good idea to shut them in every night, just to make sure nothing mean can get to them.|`|zzzd9tC4aa	I would keep them in their run for about 1-2 weeks because this gives them time to adjust to their new surroundings. Also in a run with food, water and shelter, your hens will feel safe, enabling you to be near them and tame them. However when you do let them into your garden, make sure that they can't escape through broken fences etc, because chickens are quite stupid, so if they escape, they may not find the way back in. This happened to one of mine when I was away and unfortunately it got eaten by a fox. Your hens, if they aren't already laying, will start to lay at about 20-22 weeks old. good luck.|`|qDQ5uLrSaa	Hi, Put them in the run for the night (so they know where they live) and let them out in the morning.<br>  They may need a little encouraging to go in but when it starts getting dark they should go in.<br>  <br>  Remember food is a good bribe.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  <br>  Danny|`|d8VsP2Eiaa	Couple of days should be enough. Good luck. You'll enjoy them. When one goes broody, get some classic breed fertilised eggs from your nearest poultry rare breed farm. You'll love 'em.<br>  Well done for letting them freerange

olgdyKzEaa	There are a lot of jobs out there, but if you have no prior experience working with animals, or if you don't have a strong background in biology, you probably won't find much in the way of working directly with animals. At least not in the highly sought after positions.<br>  <br>  If you are still in high school or a recent high school graduate, you can get a job as a cashier/clerk at a pet store, or you might be able to find a job as kennel help in a veterinary clinic. Some veterinarians are willing to give on the job training to veterinary assistants who show the right potential. You can also walk dogs or pet-sit. These are a handful of the positions you will most likely start out in without prior experience, but they will open doors to more "glamorous" positions/careers if you prove to be good with animals and/or seek trade specific training, certifications and degrees|`|dsqm0x9Waa	some jobs that involve working with animals are, a vetainarian, zoo keeper, and that's all i can really think about. but i know you need to have really high grades. if you want to be a vet, you have to have perfect grades, it's like a doctor for animals. the zoo keeper you have to have maybe straight a's. as for the pay i'm not sure, as you start out you get a low pay but as you become more afficient then you get more of a higher pay. hope i helped!|`|RCmm3rSPaa	If you don't have any qualifications the best way to start is by volunteering at your local animal shelter.|`|bxlYleZkaa	In the UK all sorts of jobs with animals are available and all are poorly paid unless you are extremely well qualified in a specialist field.

tT256JQRaa	going to local rescue centres can likely get you cheap or free tortoises (not so much sugar gliders, but you never know - it cant hurt to check)<br>  <br>  but with online breeders/sellers you are paying for quality - so if the animal is considerably less expensive than others (say you find a place selling a sugerglider for ￡40, when they should be maybe ￡100), then dont just but it without research on it - it could be the runt, ill/injured or even illegalally bred and is just cheap for a quick sale. you want to shop around for the best price, but dont just buy the cheapest you can find - and if you get one, make sure you do proper research on it and can house and care for it properly<br>  <br>  (tortoise caresheet) <a href="http://www.pettortoise.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.pettortoise.co.uk</a><br>  <br>  (tortoises for sale) <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adverts.showadvert/index-1031713271/badf41d4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adv...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adverts.showadvert/index-1031713739/839ff92f.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adv...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adverts.showadvert/index-1031714860/0b0dd3c6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adv...</a><br>  (there are hundreds - have a search through for the species you want) <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adverts.listadverts/cat-Pets+and+Livestock/keyword-tortoise/sec-Home+and+Family/subcat-Reptiles/startrow-1/maxrows-20/0c4a25cd.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adv...</a><br>  <br>  (sugar glider caresheet) <a href="http://www.sugar-gliders.com/sugar-glider-care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sugar-gliders.com/sugar-glide...</a><br>  <br>  (sugar gliders for sale) <a href="http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adverts.showadvert/index-1031683542/2588d65a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preloved.co.uk/fuseaction-adv...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ukclassifieds.co.uk/page-7582.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukclassifieds.co.uk/page-7582...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gumtree.com/london/95/34155395.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gumtree.com/london/95/3415539...</a>
Z9zzNYNCaa	sigh..........it's just spoiled rotten & *you* are enabling it!<br>  <br>  Feed it's dry ADULT ration & NOTHING else!<br>  It will NOT "starve". <br>  You going to let a dumb animal dictate what *you* feed? huh.....I don't cater to dogs. They don't have brains enough to get a vote.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	First I would make sure he has no dental problems. Is it possible the hard food is causing him pain.  If not I would continue to mix the two and let him eat the soft first then leave the dry for awhile and see if he will go back and eat it.  I would not put his usual amount of soft food so that he will not fill up on it and have no desire to eat the other.  But I would do it slowly so not to upset his stomach.  Good luck, German Shepherds are wonderful smart dogs I think he will catch on soon.  He is probably missing you aunt and getting used to new house and just doesn't want any more change.  How long have you had him, maybe he just needs time to adjust.|`|agh18eT2aa	Mix a little of the new food in slowly, adding a little more every week.  He will get used to it.  Also a dog will not let itself starve.  If he gets hungry, I promise he will eat the other food before he will let himself get that hungry.|`|LzsGNlOraa	Truth is yes he will eat hard food.  He will not starve himself to death.  When he's hungry enough, he'll eat the dry food and be better off for it.|`|ecYNiE0maa	when he gets hungry enough he will eat it just offer the food for 30  minutes then pick it up and offer it again later|`|7dijqYLyaa	when he is hungry enough he will eat it|`|j45Q2ipRaa	There a couple of issues that he could be dealing with.  One is that he is missing your aunt since he was her dog and the other is what he was raised with.<br>  <br>  There isn't much you can do other than love him and give him attention making him feel secure.<br>  <br>  With the food situation, since he could be grieving, he can go without eating which is not good for him.  Have you had his teeth checked?  Even at 2 he could have a lot of plaque buildup and the dry may not be comfortable for him to eat.  If his teeth are fine, I would try mixing a small about of the dry with his wet and keep it that way for a week and then in very gradual amounts keep adding the dry.  Eventually he will transition, but it will take time and patience.  Good Luck|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	PEDIGREE dog food is CR@P.  Feed a quality dog food, many out there.  I prefer Canidae All Life Stages.|`|RiW4tSx6aa	well u could put one piece of kibble in with the pedigree and then if eats it the next put two and graduly progress|`|CZYlOnRsaa	I had a similar problem when we got my Pomeranian, her previous owners had only fed her oatmeal and vienna sausages. We tried at first mixing it and she would just pick out th sausages. After about 2 weeks of this we decided if she didn't want to eat then fine. We would put won the regular food we were feeding our other dogs twice a day (no sausages or oatmeal) after missing about 4 meals she started eating. I don't necessarily recommend this until a last resort, you should try associating the new food with good things. Feed him the old stuff, but use the new stuff as treats, cover it in a bit of peanut butter or cheese at first and play with him, occasionally throw the 'treat' a him, then go right back to playing.<br>  Mix the cheese/peanut butter covered "treats" in his regular food (just a couple pieces), at about that time start using less of the cheese/peanut butter on the food during playing (but keep the same on the pieces in his regular food.). Gradually switch it so that the "treats" during play are just regular food. Try occasionally feeding him the new food you want him on, when he starts eating it, continue with the playing and "treat" tossing for a while (use less of the "treats" though).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!

o4trSMiHaa	I advise against crested geckos because of their diet requirements and their temperment :)<br>  <br>  Leopard geckos:<br>  <br>  Housing:<br>  A viv of at least 1 foot by 2 feet. glass or standard glass sliding door wood viv. Some people use large open topped fish tanks, but be careful of escapes! Others use the plastic tanks sold in petshops for juivenille lizards.<br>  <br>  pros; smaller requirements, so cheaper and easier to fit somewhere. Also means equipment is smaller and again cheaper and easier to install.<br>  <br>  Cons; Many geckos eat the calcium sand and die of impaction so you have to use either large pieces of slate, reti carpet or wood chippings for reptiles, but never ever sand or moss.<br>  <br>  Lighting;<br>  UV bulb, as they need it for vitamin D production and a heat spot at one end to bask in.a starter and lamp for the bulbs/ tubes is needed.<br>  <br>  Pros; can be easily fitted to most set ups using clamps or by threading through plastic ventilation strips.<br>  <br>  Cons; works out expensive somtimes can be annoying to find somwhere to put the plugs, may need a bit of electrical knowledge lol<br>  <br>  Diet;<br>  small crickets and mealworms, dusted with supplement for leopard geckos (for calcium)<br>  <br>  Pros; um, you dont have to defrost rats or be too vigalent with the food<br>  <br>  cons; getting hold of bugs (never from garden they might have chemicals in them), preparing food, being comfortable with bugs, storing them!<br>  <br>  Set up;<br>  you need a cooler area away from the spot bulb with a hide which is where they spend most of the time. the cool area should have a small dish of fresh water. the hotte area needs to have a heat mat at the bottom to heat the substrate.<br>  <br>  Pros; makes it look nice and allows the animal to move from hot to cool to regulate its temperature<br>  <br>  cons; can be difficult to fit it all in where you want it in the room<br>  <br>  Temperment;<br>  Often docile but somtimes rather timid. The males will fight and stress each other to starvation and a male a female will breed although stress may also be induced. not overly handleable as young specimens although can be tamed through time. Mostly they will run under a hide or stand tall and hiss at you.<br>  <br>  pros; fascinating to watch, only need one specimen, dont need lots of excersise<br>  <br>  cons; not that affectionate, need seperate tanks if more are to be kept and they dont like to be disturbed.<br>  <br>  Cost;<br>  around 70-150 for initial set up, ongoing maintenance is about 5- 10 weekly and the animal itself can be any where from 30 to170 depending on its colour morph and type. <br>  <br>  pros; only expensive in intial set up, low maintneance and generally good value<br>  <br>  cons; initial set up fee and emergency replacements of equipment can be pricey.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps !|`|bgq34jkkaa	Pros:<br>  They are small and easy to care for<br>  They poop in the same corner of the cage making so it makes it easy to take the poop out<br>  Once they are an adult, then only have to be fed 2-3 times a week<br>  They like to be by themselves, so you don't have to worry about them getting lonely :P<br>  They can be very tame if you let them get to know you<br>  Crickets are very cheap (only costs a few cents each)<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  Their main food (crickets) take a lot of caring for too, since they are live<br>  You have to: buy food for them, buy a cage for them, but water (in gel form) for them, and also go to the pet store usually every week to restock (they normally don't last more than a week, so don't think that if you get like 100, that they will last your gecko a month - they will all die)<br>  Also, if you are afraid of handling crickets, then a gecko is probably not the choice for you (some do eat mealworms, but mine won't touch them, so you never know)<br>  <br>  Also, don't listen to the poster above, geckos are really not that hard to care for, just put it somewhere you will remember it so you won't forget to feed it and you shouldn't have a problem.|`|59zYV36Eaa	Leopards are pretty much all good.  The only bad part could be if you can't get bugs.  They should always have a dish of worms in their cage and need to get their crickets a few times a week.  Bob already told you about the how they poop in a corner, thats a pro.  Now cresteds are cool, but they are a little more work.  They eat baby food (or something similar) and crickets.  They tend to get their cages pretty messy, that's a con.  They are really cool to play with though.  I would suggest for someone to start with a leopard and get a crested when they're ready for a little more of a challenge.|`|TPe7yiBYaa	<a href="http://www.rightpet.com/ReptileDetail/leopard-gecko" rel="nofollow">http://www.rightpet.com/ReptileDetail/le...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rightpet.com/ReptileDetail/crested-gecko" rel="nofollow">http://www.rightpet.com/ReptileDetail/cr...</a>|`|tzPEckiZaa	Most novice lizard owners kill leopard geckos pretty quickly.

Bw18seFqaa	perhaps you are not rinsing her well enough when bathing?<br>  <br>  overbathing?  she should only be bathed when smelly or dirty, expecially in the wintertime..  bathing strips the skin and coat of natural oils and can cause dryness.<br>  <br>  diet..  feed a high quality kibble.  You can also add more fatty acids to the diet - a spoonful of olive oil or salmon oil over the food a few times a week, or a fish oil caspule will help|`|oFldwoCWaa	I'm not so sure I think she might have dandruff.

6ApIp7Ryaa	They read body language, understand tone and possibly use their sense of smell to know a lot about us. <br>  <br>  I think they have a sense of now, and understand strong emotions like fear love and anger. They probably don't understand abstract things or complex emotions, like crying while being happy for example<br>  <br>  There is a great book about how animals think, or at least how one person thinks they do, and compares it to autism.<br>  I have linked to excerpts from it below.<br>  <br>  I think often dogs understand us better than we understand them|`|MKdR8MIUaa	Hi, My name is Tucker and   I'm an Australian Shepherd.  We dogs can "read" a remarkable number of cues.  My human "Mom" says that she has had to learn to be a much calmer person, because if she gets upset - in any way - I'm there to take care of her and make things right.  At first, I "read" the volume of her words, then I tuned in on tone of voice.  People also give physical clues - like changes in scent, when they are nervous or upset.(Some dogs can alert owners to seizures, etc.)  Now Mom wonders if I have "learned"  what she sees to be a problem - like bad drivers - she tries not to react in any way, but I still bark at bad drivers. The article below is interesting.  (The other is MY blog.)|`|CyDVisE7aa	i don't think so because every time I go to get some milk the little bugger has already eaten my stake you think when I tell him no he won;t do it lol honestly I think they can tell how you feel emotionally by how you express your selfs around them so if you mad and yelling they can tell something is wrong with you if your happy they can tell that but I am no animal scientist.|`|x8rqX6Enaa	I think they do..<br>  One of my dogs was put to sleep the other day and my sister was the nicest to her.. and she was crying and she licked every single tear and then lay down in her lab when she was given the medicine...:'s|`|0QuPtuK4aa	they understand your body language and tone of voice<br>  some of your more intelligent dogs do understand words after you teach them|`|qeu8Oullaa	they understand a few things like sit and paw, but they wont understand, get me a drink and turn on the tv etc.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Our chihuahuas are the same way. Yes, I think they can, at least a lot of what we say.|`|agh18eT2aa	They sense the energy we are putting out.  Since our energy matches our feelings and matches what we say, they get the gist of it from our auras.  If you are sad and crying and saying how bad you feel, the dog only gets the feeling from you, it does not know you are saying sad things.  Crying in humans sounds a lot like whimpering in dogs, so it's not a hard thing for them to pick up on.  Shouting sounds a lot like barking, so they take it as aggression.  And they pick up on the tension.  THey are smart, but no they don't understand any language but their own.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Yes - but it's more down to sounds/tone of voice, and of course, body language - try speaking the same words in a foreign language and see what reaction you get.<br>  <br>  Tell you a story - and this is the absolute truth.  A friend of mine had a dog who was pushing her to the limits.  It got to the point that she called me and said if he didn't start to cooperate in terms of behaving himself he'd have to go.  From that moment on, the dog was a changed person.  He stopped all his previous nonsense, and was a joy to live with.  If he didn't understand what was being said, what was that all about!!?<br>  <br>  This ability to know how you are feeling is what makes the relationship between man and dog so special!|`|T38lIQ8Gaa	I doubt they understand what you say. Ask him/her to tap the floor twice for yes, once for no. j/k.<br>  <br>  They can get a general gist of what we say/mean by the tonality in our voice and our body language. If we're calm when we talk to them they appear to sympathize, yet when we yell they instinctively back away.<br>  <br>  A lot of things they learn - Sit, Fetch, etc - they learn through repetition (see: Pavlov's bell), so they may just be going 'through the motions' as it were...<br>  <br>  It's been said that dogs (as well as cats) can have a much higher sensory range. Maybe we give off auras to them depending on mood. We'll never know...|`|76cAAPfBaa	They understand the TONE of your voice! Like if you tell them "NO"! in an angry tone, and point at them exactly when they do something you think is wrong. They are able to understand that tone, even if they don't actually understand the word itself.|`|7vo1JiYIaa	They do understand our body language.
v0RsFaAzaa	It has nothing do with the dog being male or female. It depends on the bond that the owner has with their dog.

tT256JQRaa	what kind of tortoise are you planning on getting?<br>  <br>  well... any tortoise nowadays should be kept inside somewhere in a safe environment, if not the house, then atleast a shed with an electricity supply for a heatmat/bulb.<br>  <br>  it gets far too cold here in winter, and even though they hibernate, you still need to check on them and make sure they are getting through it ok. if tortoises are underweight then going through hibernation can kill them, and so shouldnt be allowed to do so, which you can only do by keeping in at a constant temperature by keeping it in a heat vivarium/tank.<br>  <br>  a rabbit hutch wont keep the heat in for him, and will more than likely kill him if its kept outside - a coldsnap or, snow or a really rainy day in winter wont do him any good.<br>  <br>  he can go outside on warmer days (with supervision), but for the most part he should be kept safely inside.<br>  tortoises are too nice expensive not to take care of properly.<br>  <br>  heres a good website for you to help :)<br>  <a href="http://www.petsparade.co.uk/articles/?a=35" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsparade.co.uk/articles/?a=...</a>|`|PG7WfGpHaa	For a long lived animal, they seem to have curiously short lifespans when kept in Britain.|`|bxlYleZkaa	You will need to provide an adequately safe and secure place, NOT a rabbit hutch, in which your tortoise can hibernate for six months of the year.

b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	You will have to get her spayed. You can't stop it unless you get her spayed.<br>  <br>  Female cats can go into heat and get pregnant as early as 4 months of age. They are usually in heat for 7 to 10 days at a time, and will go in and out of heat every week or two until they are mated or spayed. While in heat female cats may leak a clear liquid from their vaginal area, however they do not bleed or have a menstrual cycle. If your cat is bleeding or having any discharge other than clear it is an emergency and your cet needs to bee seen by a vet asap. <br>  <br>  It is best to spay and neuter all cats before they reach sexual maturity (as early as 3 months to before 6 months) to avoid pregnancy, deadly pyometra (uterus infection), urine marking/ spraying, discomfort to the cat and the annoying behavioral issues that unfixed cats, both male and female, display. <br>  <br>  Please Spay and Neuter!<br>  <br>  The average number of litters a fertile cat can produce in one year is 3.<br>  <br>  The average number of kittens in a feline litter is 4–6.<br>  <br>  In seven years, one female cat and her offspring can theoretically produce 420,000 cats. <br>  <br>  Only 1 in 12 of those 420,000 cats born finds a home. :o(<br>  <br>  Even if you found homes for all your cats, you are still taking away homes that other homeless cats could have had by adding to the population.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes its normal.

It's better to be safe than sorry! She should have been taken to the vet before she had the puppies, so you could find out how many puppies she is carrying, how large the puppies are, and if she is going to be able to whelp them on her own. If she's only had one puppy, she probably still has more and is having problems. She may need a C-Section to remove the puppies that are remaining. Keep in mind that if you do not take her in and she is having complications, her and her puppies can die. If you don't want that to happen, then I would get moving! Don't wait for answers here!

o4trSMiHaa	Well from the sounds of this not being rude but snakes arent the best choice for you. Most snakes will eat mice and only mice, true you could get a garter snake but they arent great for beginners as if you wanted to feed them a mouse free diet you would need a bit of experiance in snake feeding anyway, as some snakes are picky about taking mice so trying to feed a garter snake that was comercially bred things like fish, crickets and worms would be a challenge. <br>  <br>  Also the fat and thin thing you have going on, its not really about that you should more look at what the snake is like temperment wise and how easy it is to look after rather than what it looks like. <br>  <br>  Dont get a rough green as they arent for beginners, they need adequete space and arent as easy to look after as you think. <br>  <br>  I would suggest a rat snake a corn snake, although they all eat mice.You could try a garter snake but please please do alot and i mean alot of research on this first! <br>  <br>  Prehaps you should try and convince your parents to let you have somthing else, like a lizard or turtle? they are easier to care for in some circumstances and dont eat mice! <br>  <br>  whatever you decide please remeber to do lots of research into it first, hope this helps and good luck :)|`|f8cd152c1974c8efa419c1a70fd40f6aaa	Snakes such as garters may take a diet of crickets and feeder fish but any snake on such a diet risks parasitic infection.

sUXyRlVjaa	From the UKC Standard:<br>  HEIGHT & WEIGHT<br>  <br>  The acceptable height range is from 10 inches to 12? inches. Weight is in proportion to the build, neither too fat nor too thin.<br>  <br>  Disqualifications: Height under 10 inches or over 12? inches.<br>  <br>  AKC Standard:<br>  Size, Proportion, Substance <br>  Size -10 inches to 12? inches in height allowed, with desired height 11 inches to 11? inches measured at highest point of the shoulder blades. Disqualification -Under 10 inches or over 12? inches in height. Length of males equals height at withers.

Depending on the size of your dog and the strength of the tablets.  If you dog is small then unfortunately if you can't induce vomiting then death is likely.  Call your vet now.<br>  <br>  If you can't get a hold of your vet then- Giving fresh hydrogen peroxide will help induce vomiting in a dog.  So get a fresh bottle and start trying to put it down your dogs throat.  This has happen to me before, and this is what the vet recommended.  With me it was two tablets as well.  I have four dogs of various sizes and wasn't sure which on got into the medicine.  Thankfully it was the biggest dog so no real harm occurred.  The hydrogen peroxide will not hurt your dog, it will just make them sick to their stomach.  So you can give just about as much as you need to induce vomiting.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	It depemds on what strength as they can range from 500mgs down to 10 mgs.if it was two 500 mgs which is a large dose for a child for example l would have gotten her to the vet to induce her to vomit the tablets depending when you found out your pet had eaten them as if it happened several hours before it would already have reached the stomach and spread through the body.You have two choices,ring the vet  wmergency and ask what to do or if in ordinary working hours ring and they will recommend to you what to do.l could give you the brand name of what we use to induce a dog to regurgetate eaten tablets or items in the surgery but your Country may use different products.one thousand mgs is an awful lot for a small dog and could lead to a shut down of vital organs but this really only happens if it is a continual thing not a one off.personally as a vet nurse if my dog ate the tablets l would flush it out but you would not know how to do this.if a small breed ring the vet ASAP if a large breed l would monitor carefully an try and get the dog to drink as much fluid as possible to flush the system out if posssible.if he starts to become lethargic and he may and especially sleepy then ring the vet.Either way l would spend a couple of cents by ringing your local vet but before that make sure what the dosage is of each tablet and it will be on the packet or bottle so the vet can then diagnose what you should do.Good luck|`|6ApIp7Ryaa	Liver and/or kidney failure leading to death is the worst outcome.<br>  <br>  I would be contacting a vet asap to see if you need to bring them in.<br>  <br>  My dog swallowed ibuprofen and the vet was there in 30 min inducing vomiting.

Have a stiptic powder handy to use in case the cut makes the nail bleed.  Ferric subsulfate stiptic powder. Most Horsefields or Russian tortoises grow toenails slowly, needing only annual trimming
Zgs4RncIaa	Cocker Spaniels are GREAT dogs, we had a male cocker spaniel for 7 yrs. <br>  <br>  If I may make a few suggestions though.<br>  1. CAGE train, I know it seems cruel but you will have a better behaved dog! When ours got used to his cage, he used it as like a security blanket, it was "his" place.<br>  2. Consider a female over a male. Our C.S. when he got excited he would pee all over the place and i'm not talking a few drops, I'm talking full bladder explosion! I was told he may grow out of it but he never did, so when we greeted him we had to take him outside first then greet him out there.<br>  3. True about the ears, I had medication from the Vet that we would use and they also have a cleaning solution for the ears. We never had problems with his ears. Just make sure when you bath him/her you don't get water in them.<br>  4. C.S can be yappy. We trained ours using a muzzle. Sounds mean but it worked! Tazzy was not yappy at all. When he was a puppy and he would bark unnecessarily  we would put the muzzle on for about 3-4 minutes and tell him NO! After he got the picture he would only bark if someone knocked on the door or he seen someone he didn't know.<br>  5. Grooming - Not sure if you like the long hair, but I didn't! So we would get him shaved as close as they could shave him. He was a beautiful dog even without all the hair.<br>  6. As far as the outlets go, I've never had a puppy or dog that bothered with the outlets. You have to watch the chewing on cords, but as long as you are stern with him/her they will stay away from them!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Congratulations on your soon to be new puppy. You sound like you are really ready to be a good owner!|`|7vo1JiYIaa	How about a Labrador Retriever or a Pug ?|`|uLHyDOm1aa	i know that some puppies are just really destructive<br>  but cocker spaniels arent thaat bad<br>  just make sure wires, shoes, chair legs and food is out of the way<br>  and you should be fine<br>  and all the basics<br>  and YES you should def use a circuit breaker<br>  but everything will be fine<br>  <br>  x|`|6ApIp7Ryaa	A soft dog toy for the puppy to chew. It is hard to know what other toys to get as each dog has their own personalities and these change as they grow older.<br>  <br>  I know my dog loved a soft dog toy with a squeaker in it.<br>  <br>  Putting things up out of the way is the best thing. Also if you are always there with the puppy when it is inside if you tell it off for going near power cables etc soon it won't want to go near them.<br>  <br>  Get the dog its own bed, even if it will sleep with you eventually its good to start off in a separate bed as there will be nighttime toilet accidents for a while. All the usual vaccinations and worming stuff.<br>  <br>  Wishing you joy of your new puppy, nothing beats their lovely trusting eyes|`|97sKOWQ0aa	You are blessed Christine.<br>  <br>  Love is the greatest thing you can give your Cocker Spaniel .<br>  <br>  You will know what to do.<br>  Food<br>  Treats<br>  Love<br>  Potty training. Newspaper. When you put new Newspaper down save a little from the last so your puppy knows where to go. It is the smell that reminds them where to go.<br>  <br>  Don't forget worm medicine.<br>  Make the blind cords so it can't reach them.<br>  The outlets are OK.<br>  Extension cords try to hide.<br>  They like to chew on everything.<br>  So make sure there are no objects on the floor that your puppy can swallow that may harm it.<br>  <br>  Just some suggestions.<br>  <br>  They love to snuggle.<br>  They are so warm and soft.<br>  <br>  I told you .You are blessed.|`|QPyB6Er4aa	Oh, That is so wonder for you!<br>  The puppy will also need her own food dish.  They can probably share a water dish.  She should have their own beds.<br>  Hair dryer for long hair.<br>  Get electric outlet covers like for babies, cords, I don't know - except to block them off with furniture.  You might not need to bother at all.  And you can install a circuit breaker on any outlet.  If you can do it, cool.  Or have an electrician do it.<br>  If you have an extra room put some plastic on top of newspaper directly on the floor.  Then put an old carpet on top of that.  She will learn to "go to bed" on her own that way.  Both of my Labrador Retrievers did that and there was never a question of separation anxiety.  EVER!  She can hear you moving around the house, so you just tell her that its bed time, "go sleep" or something like that.<br>  I know little to nothing about Cocker's grooming, so I'll shut up!|`|uL3mIoc6aa	<a href="http://readyanswers.advancedroofinginc.net" rel="nofollow">http://readyanswers.advancedroofinginc.n...</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|0QuPtuK4aa	patience,lots of attention-not all toys are for puppies also remember you are the teacher your new dog will learn more in the next few months at this age so teach well-your local extension service should be able to help,animal rescue etc;|`|x8rqX6Enaa	puppy′s are the cutest thing on earth... but if I were you I′d recommend picking it up on Friday, like we did.

cETQuE9waa	Dogs are not fashion accessories. They are living, breathing animals which require exercise, training, and socialization.  Besides these "fashion accessories" are not allowed in many stores and many places of business.<br>  If someone is going to just carry the dog around in one of those dog bags then it is going to get bored and overweight. Dogs require exercise no matter how tiny they are. <br>  If someone fails to train and socialize their dog it could bite someone or it may become destructive.<br>  I can see putting a jacket on a dog if it is cold or a shirt on the dog if it is cold but, all these dresses, pajamas, and jewelry is really out of control. It is a dog, not a child. Dogs don't need all these things.  If you are just putting it on for pictures I have no problems with it but, if your letting you dog walk around in dresses and jewelry all day you have created a human dog.  Dogs are not humans.|`|agh18eT2aa	Dogs are pets and we are to love them and care for them as if they were our children.  If a person has a dog only as a status symbol or to show off and that person does not love and care for that animal any more than a designer handbag or pair of fancy shoes, then it is wrong in every sense.  How can you prove someone is carrying a dog around just as a decorative object and not because they love it and want it near them?  That's the hard part of your assignment.  If you interviewed those folks, you know they would tell you they loved the dog.|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Please read all of this so you understand what I am trying to say.  Yes, I am the owner of what some people would call a "purse" dog.  She's tiny.  4.5 lbs.  She is not an accessories.  I do have a bag I carry her in when I go antiquing...but that's because she just "gets tired" she sleeps or just lays and watches.  I also have a dog stroller (not just for her but other middle size dogs I train).  I walk 8-9 miles a day.  When she gets tired she gives me a look...I question "up?' and she sits.  If she is just messing with me (playfully) she slowly runs ahead (on a leash) with a quick glance behind.  <br>  I have never looked at my dog as "other people will pay attention to me if I have a dog that's small" - they are not meant to be attention getter's they are attention "givers".  She gives me so much, teaches me so much.  She listens when I am upset and never repeats a thing, she celebrates with me when I'm happy with her little dance of joy.  She helps me daily work with out of control, aggressive  dogs so they do not have to be put down --- this is her passion.  She is drawn to them and it is like magic watching her.<br>  People who think of dogs as accessories do not LOVE their dogs, they love themselves.  I will tell you in my business I have seen this off and on.  Usually by the end of working with them I have talked them into giving the dog to someone who really wants to love him/her.  If that is not the case...I just show them what a dog is about...what makes them tick...why they do the things they do.  It is the highest honor when you see the light go on and then watch love and respect just consume them.  They have apologizing to do and do it...they have revamping their life styles and they do it.  Some people just do not know what they have, they get it because it's "in" but when they finally see and are touched...their lives are forever changed.  Some of them are my strongest advocates at spreading the word to "their" communities.  We do this by teaching not yelling.  They spread what they have learned and many lives are changed for the better because of it.  A lot of people do things out of ignorance...that is why I teach.<br>  Your question is one that brings on immeasurable emotions both good and bad.  I think it is great that you are going to do an assignment on it...it will awaken many people into "seeing truth".  You have the floor to speak so use it wisely.  When people get all crazy/wild/mad...remember people do not listen to them.  It's when well educated people "inform" that  they are heard.  Good luck on your assignment...I know you will do a great job!|`|2O58btqxaa	what do you call fashion accessories  my jrt has a pink t shirt with her name on and a blue jacket that she wears to go out when it is cold so stuff like that i think is ok|`|YgGi07Rpaa	I wouldn't call them "fashion accessories" but I don't see any wrong doing if you dress your dogs up with clothes and they don't seem to mind it, like those are called "Lap Dogs" the spoiled ones like Pomeranians and Chihuahuahs (Sorry I spelled it wrong) when I get my Pomeranian in a few years I will dress it up and spoil it but it will still be a dog, like play fetch lol, and all dogs are always dogs you can't change that...|`|tb0NMaooaa	more and more people are viewing their animals: cats and dogs as kids/ <br>  <br>  I love it. its so cute.

Just because I bring her everywhere with me dose not mean she is a toy or anything like that.

People that want accessories should try a handbag or some bracelets or a fancy belt, NOT a dog.<br>  <br>  A dog is not happy being confined to someone's arms all day or even worse, their carryall. Even more, they do not want to be dressed up in stupid CUTE outfits. Cute for who? Generally, they are uncomfortable for the dog. A coat for the dog if it is cold, yes. But the dog belongs on the end of a lead and being taken for walks and when it isnt, it should be happy at home in the house or yard where it lives. It is part of the family, not part of PRADA's latest line!|`|8NqQvOqQaa	I'm against it.<br>  Its kinda stupid dont you think?<br>  Dogs are animals not accessories.<br>  Its only blonde, stupid a**holes that use dogs as accessories to be honest<br>  and we can't really call them "humans" anyways.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I am against it.  While I truly love my dogs, and enjoy spending every second with them as much as possible, I do think we have to draw the line as having a dog as a fashion accessory.  I have been horrified to see people bringing their dogs into a grocery store, and then complaining to a manager about it, and the manager not understanding what I was talking about.  I don't want someones pet around groceries I am purchasing.  You also have to be concerned as to whether these dogs actually have shots.  Who is to say that one of these dogs doesn't have parvo, and then you get contaminated walking by the dog, and you contaminate the dogs at your house.  I am sure if I saw a dog in the restaurant I was eating in, I would vomit.  I think it is great to care about your dog, and to want to give it a good home, but I think there is a limit to what we have a right to put on the general public.  Some people have real fears of dogs, any dogs, so it is not right to force the general public to put up with the stress of someone else's dog.  I don't want to go to a movie theatre and listen to someones dog barking all through the movie.  I think it is great to love your dog, but leave it at home when you go out to run errands.  I don't want to get fleas or other diseases from these dogs.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	There are NO positives - only negatives.<br>  <br>  I think its soooo wrong to treat them like an non-living accessory.  They are living, breathing animals and should be treated like a normal dog.  You walk them on a leash, you don't dress them up "cute" and you train them in basic commands and feed them DOG food - not people food.<br>  <br>  If people want an accessory, then go carry around a cute little STUFFED fake dog - not a live one!

Neither of my cats saw a cardiologist - it was just diagnosed with a stethoscope - and neither of them died of complications attributable to a heart complaint.<br>  <br>  Please dont worry too much.  If your vet feels your cat is suffering in any way there will be medication he can prescribe but most cats never need it.<br>  <br>  PS - Why does your vet use a scale of 1-5 when 6 is normally the highest?  Whatever the reason, I have read that even cats who are diagnosed with a score of 6 can carry on quite happily, so 2 is really very low.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	heart murmurs arent life threatening...but your cat is getting up there in age..<br>  i wouldnt worry about the visit to a cardiologist...i would just maintain his health and enjoy the rest of his life with him..<br>  any time a pet goes to the vet its very stressful...unless its a dire emergency then i wouldnt put him through the tests with the cardiologist...<br>  good luck

I wonder if she may have experienced some sort of trauma while outside. Have you checked her over thoroughly for any signs of trauma? If you haven't then you need to. If all that checks out then maybe it's from spending the night out in the wet and cold. I mean could she find shelter or anything? She may have just spend a night alone being cold and scared. ( I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I know sometimes dogs don't cooperate the best.)<br>  If it were me I'd just give it some time and see what happens.  I think that's really all you can do at this point. <br>  Of course if she stops eating or shows any signs of an illness go to your vet.

That info could help in solving this question.
4yt4D3vMaa	1.Yes they can be very friendly although many rabbits don't like being picked up but they can get used to it. rabbits like to be petted at floor level and if you choose a confident friendly one (not one that is very nervous) it shouldn't take long for him/her to bond with you.<br>  2. 6-8 weeks. <br>  3.Never use clay based cat litter as they can eat it and can cause a blockage in their gut. Paper based cat litter, shredded newspaper,hay and straw are all good litters-some pets stores sell special rabbit litter but it's very overpriced!<br>  4.A cat litter tray is fine.<br>  5.Rabbits usually choose an area of their cage for their toilet-if you place the tray there with some soiled bedding they should keep using it. just remember when you clean it out to leave a little of the soiled litter so they recognise it's their toilet area.<br>  6.It doesn't have to go outside but it can be nice to let them out in the summer, either in a run, on a harness or in a bunny proofed garden(fenced in and no poisonous plants). It's not good to let a house rabbit out in cold weather as changes in temperature are not good for them.<br>  7.the main part of a rabbits diet should be hay, ideally good quality timothy or oat hay with some alfalfa for a growing rabbit. a handful of good quality pellets daily is plenty and greens can be gradually introduced at around 3 months. more on rabbit diet here<br>  <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/diet.html</a><br>  8.lots of handling and sitting down at the rabbits level are good ways to bond with your rabbit-most rabbits love their cheeks rubbed and the front of their face above the nose. rabbits don't like their chin touched or around their mouth and nose, some don't like touched near their back end but they will get used to it and it's good to get them used to being touched all over for vets exams and nail clipping etc.<br>  9. as often as you and your rabbit like! you should spend some time with your rabbit at least once a day but you'll probably find you want to spend more time with it than that:)<br>  10. rabbits can make excellent pets and have very distinct personalities and can be quite cheeky sometimes! The main thing is to choose the right one-I spent over an hour choosing my current house rabbit. he was in with other males and I waited to see which ones came over to sniff my hand- a few did, others ran away when I tried to pet them but my one came up and pushed his nose under my hand to get his nose rubbed so that was it for me! he's one of the tamest rabbits I've ever had so it's worth taking the time to choose the right one.<br>  Very good rabbit info on this site about health, care and behaviour <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/hrs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/hrs.html</a>|`|t6UkxbBNaa	1.

Yea they can be friendly and close, but you will have to pay a lot of attention to your rabbit and play with it EVERY DAY!<br>  2. Usually weaning a rabbit at about 6 weeks old is fine. The younger they are, the more impressionable and more easy they are to tame and train.<br>  3. You should beable to use any kind of litter, but usually rabbits don't liketo dig to use the bath room. Some shredded newspapaer might be a good choice too.<br>  4. Just a regular cat litter box should do fine.<br>  5. When you rabbit does go t the bathroom, put the droppings in the litter box. Usually rabbits will try to g to the bathroom in one place, so when they smell the droppings they will poo in the same place. Some rabbits will not box train though.<br>  6. They don't have to go out side, but just like any one they do like going out in the sun some times, and fresh grass is a favorite treat! Rabbits are fine in the snow, but if they are inside they may not be used to the cold, so short romps in the snow would be ok, but you'll have to watch to make sure it doesn't get too cold and wet.<br>  7. Rabbit pellets should be the main sourse of food. The amount depends on the size of your rabbit. Usually about 1 cup in the morning and evening will be fine, or you may beable to use a self feeder and let the rabbit eat as much as it wants. They will stop eating when they are full. Fresh fruit and veggies are also a good suplement that provides lots of vitamins. Be carefull feeding lettus though! Some types of lettus will make your rabbit bloat up and die! If you aren't sure what kind is toxic to your rabbit, and you have trouble knowing what variety of lettus you are getting it is best just to skip it. Try feeding carrots, apples, cucumber, banana, grass hay, ad any ther fresh fruit or veggie.<br>  8. When you first get your rabbit feed it by hand. When the rabbit eats it will smell you and associate you with a food provider and comfort. Pet it and hold it when ever you can!<br>  9. You will have to play with it daily! Play with it as much as possable. The more you play with it, hte more tame and closer they will become.<br>  10. Yes they are a low maintainance pet, and can be very entertaining. Best of all they are usually quiet!|`|UDwkesAIaa	1, they should be you will need to gain its trust by holding it and talking to it regularly (not once in a blue moon)<br>  2, 6 weeks minimum but most people sell them at eight weeks just to be sure.<br>  3, Wood shavings is what i use (make sure its not sawdust as can cause respiratory infections)<br>  4, A cat litter tray. <br>  5, I scooped up their poo then put it in the litter tray also put the tray in the corner they wee and poo in.<br>  6, if you dont want it to go outside then no but it will need plenty of fresh hay i wouldnt put them outside in the snow if it is used to being inside as it will b too cold for it.<br>  7, i feed mine pellets 150grams half in the morning half at night then give it fresh food as an occasional treat, but their is no harm giving it frsh food everday (just not lettice as it is bad for them and gives them the squits.)<br>  8, Try giving it a football (a light one) my rabbits dont play football but i no someones whos does. try sitting on the floor and letting it run around you and stroke it and speak to it. it will come to u if it trust you.<br>  9, Everyday if you want to keep the trust<br>  10, Yes i will always have a rabbit|`|m32Oq4cfaa	1. Are they very friendly/cuddly/become close to me?<br>  <br>  They can.  It depends on the rabbit.  Spaying/neutering calm them and make them more friendly.<br>  <br>  2. How old should it be when I get one?(so its had enough time with its mother, but its young enough so it will become close to me as it gets older)<br>  <br>  I think no younger than 6 weeks?  I've never had a young baby though so I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  3. What kind of litter should I use?<br>  <br>  It depends on what you and the rabbit prefer.  I use Aspen shavings.  Cedar and pine aren't really good for them.  Yesterday's News hides odor well enough.  Carefresh is a good option too.<br>  <br>  4. what kind of litter box should I use?<br>  <br>  One that's higher on the sides and in the back.  Mine use a covered cat box.  That has helped to keep mess down to a minimum.<br>  <br>  <br>  5.What are some good litter training techniques?<br>  <br>  Mine just used the litter box naturally.  I don't know. Maybe I was lucky.<br>  <br>  6. I'm planning on giving it 1 room to run around freely after its box trained, does it still need to go outside? <br>  <br>  Nah.  As long as it's getting exercise than it doesn't NEED to go outside.  Though, I'm sure it would enjoy it.<br>  Can they go outside in snow?<br>  <br>  7. What should the daily diet be?...Be exact please Ex. 1/4 cup pellets in morn. and night and lettuce at night. (like that)<br>  <br>  About 1/4 cup of pellets per day.  More if you're rabbit is bigger.  Fresh veggies daily and unlimited hay.  Fruits are ok but give sparingly.  Baby rabbits shouldn't get greens until at least 4 months of age and introduce different foods one at a time.<br>  <br>  8. What are some good ways to get it to become close to you and want to you to play/pet with it? Spay/neuter it!  Then just be patient.  Sit quietly and talk to it, hand feed it some veggies.  Just give it time.<br>  <br>  9. How often should I play with it? Every day<br>  <br>  10. Overall, do they make good pets?<br>  <br>  If you do your research and know what you're getting into, then yes, they can be great pets!|`|rbRqLgvgaa	1. Yes, they are very friendly, but it also depends on how they have been brought up in their life, <br>  2. Im not sure about that question,<br>  3. Dont know<br>  4. Dont know<br>  5. I didnt litter train mine...<br>  6. Yes, i dont see the harm in not letting in outside in the fresh air? and yeaah, theres no harm in putting it in the snow, i did a couple week ago with my rabbits, and bunnys...<br>  7.  I give mine, some, rabbit food in the morning, which includes pellets and stuff, and maybe some letuce in the afternoon, or at night to bribe them in their hutch,<br>  8, Get it out the hutch everyday and play with it, feed it some treats or snacks every often or so, that kinda stuff will make the rabbit more close to you, and friendly towards you, my rabbit is vicious, so, im going to try start doing this kinda stuff to get him to be more friendly towards me and others.<br>  9. It depends how close you want to get to this rabbit, if you wanna be its best bud, i think everyday, maybe twice a day.. or if you want to become sorta close, every other day.<br>  10. I think they make great pets, as you can play with them, and teach them new tricks, etc; potty train.<br>  <br>  Errm, no i dont think so, but they can eat other stuff like biscuits, weetabix, etc;

Jkt3UkTBaa	I live in Dubai and I go to a local pet store almost every week.<br>  <br>    They have everything from saltwater to freshwater and every thing in between, they have :<br>  Goldfish<br>  Koi fish<br>  Neon Tetras<br>  Zebra Danios<br>  Oscar fish<br>  Angelfish<br>  Discus<br>  Guppies<br>  Clown fish<br>  Crabs ( saltwater and freshwater )<br>  Snails<br>  Plecos of all sorts<br>  Corys of all sorts<br>  Platys<br>  Mollies<br>  There aren't many Cichlids but there are some.<br>  Freshwater blowfish<br>  Bala sharks<br>  Clown Loaches<br>  That's all i can think of but as you see there is a pretty good selection but this is a probably the best shop in dubai so they have to have good supplies
l0ktQUnWaa	Stress is the most likely answer. Give her time to get used to her new home. Try to leave her alone until she starts eating. Then you can handle her a little. <br>  Good luck!|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Count yourself lucky that it ate a pellet. Some turtles go for a couple of weeks before they feel comfortable enough to eat in their new home.|`|zRzb1scdaa	get to the doctor already!
c0WDwV2Oaa	I thought you wrote How to Skin a Puppy, sorry different catagory|`|VBT3Itffaa	Here's a hint for the next time you weigh her. Weigh yourself first, and then pick her up and get on the scale again. Subtract. You will find the accurate weight. :) Go to the vet, because he can tell if Puppy is too skinny. Have a nice day!|`|AA11244754	you need to call your vet and ask about her weight if you are this concerned instead  of getting on here and asking complete strangers, most of whom don't know anything about animal medicine.|`|XKNQkwuGaa	her weight is not bad for her age so just feed her a little more often and add a little cooked meat to her food along with warn water to soften up the chow so she can eat more of it. deworming has to be done several times in the next few months to make sure all the parasites are gone and as she starts chewing better u can leave dry chow out along with other treats to keep her teeth nice and strong until her adult teeth come in. feed her 5 to 6 times a day and she will get more weight as she gets older. good luck|`|B01Qv9gUaa	If you're concerned you should talk to your vet. You should be able to feel her ribs, but not see them. <br>  <br>  There are parasites and disease that can make a dog skinny, even if they're eating a lot....but only a vet can diagnose those.|`|Rr2D2POcaa	I'd check with the vet again, ask him or another vet if this is the normal weight for a dog of that breed and age.|`|tFKQYT6Naa	well that sounds pretty normal to me 11lbs at 12 weeks but idk...you should call your vet and maybe they will give you viatamin enriched food that will make your dog gain weight|`|4IC78le4aa	She should be getting fed more than 3 times a day at 12 weeks. I think you need to consult a dog specialist or do some research on what to feed a pup.<br>  <br>  Generally, puppy chow is good but not to eat all the time. You can try Farax in the morning (it is a type of porridge for babies and pups like it) and mix in some plain white or brown boiled rice and veges (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower and a little potato pushed through a sieve and mix it through with the Puppy Chow, All animals need a little variety and this may help with her weight.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, you should not be able to see a dog's ribs but in Australia we go by Kilos and I am not sure how much 11 pounds is in kilos so I cant answer about its weight.|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Pups at that age need to have food available to them at all times.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do DO NOT cut back on feed. It is different for a pup then an adult dog. They need that nutrition to grow. Stick with your puppy's food. Do not add human food this will create a whole new problem. Adding warm water was a great idea. It will soften up the food and make it easier to eat.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	It is NOT!!!<br>  FAT is BAD,not CORRECT weight!You're SUPPOSED be able able find ribs w/out shoveling through inches of BLUBBER!!!!<br>  <br>  FOOD DOES *NOT* EQUAL "LOVE"!!! OBESE DOGS ARE >>>NOT<<<< "well loved"!! They're being KILLED!<br>  <br>  Do NOT stuff the poor thing to OBESITY ,crippling & EARLY DEATH!!!<br>  Do not feed 3 times a day!|`|BGPG2FaFaa	i think that if ur dog is to skinny that either your not feeding him or her enough or it is just skinny naturally.but i think u should take it to the vet.
l0ktQUnWaa	You should always quarantine a new reptile in a separate tank. There is no way to tell by looking if a turtle may be carrying something contagious. Watch the new one for any signs of illness. It is always a good idea to get a fecal test and have a vet do a check up on any new reptile.<br>  Good luck!|`|2W6mZPXDaa	It is possible that foreign contaminants(talking about outside the tank of-course) may get your original turtle ill, but you probably should keep the new one in the same tank but separate the two with a plastic/glass barrier for a few days so the new one can settle into the new home. That way when you remove the barrier, the two turtles will have a significantly reduced chance to get each other infected(likewise with fish). Good Luck with your new pet.|`|buzL6Yn0aa	Are they the same kind of turtles.  Or two different kinds of turtles|`|sKBurf3kaa	same type or not|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	If neither one is sick, there should be no problem from disease. However, some turtles, such as red-eared sliders, are notoriously territorial, so one turtle might attack the other, especially if the tank is too small for them.

You want to look at it's underside at the base of the tail.  If there are two bumps it's a boy.  You should probably see a "v" next to them, closer to the belly.  If you don't really see nothing down there you got a girl.  Maybe that will make it easier to pick a name.|`|sUN7TVtzaa	males have preanal pores in the shape of a V right by thier tail and also have two small bulges on the base of the tail. females don't. males are more bulky and slightly bigger than females too.<br>  <br>  my two females names are Meagan and Max(we thought Max was aboy but she isn't!)<br>  my male is named McCheeto! we were naming them all starting with M so that ishis name! or just Cheeto for short:)
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Your tank is already stocked to capacity. Also, Oscars do best in soft water, and the others you have (except the jewel) need hard water to thrive.<br>  <br>  So no, don't put an Oscar in there.<br>  <br>  The Oscar may be 2 or 3 inches long now, but soon enough it will be about a foot long. The same is true of the Texas Cichlid, and the Frontosa. The pleco will be around 2 feet long when full grown.|`|4ap1GPvsaa	I dont recommend putting an oscar in that aquarium, reasons being that oscars can grow to 14in. and might eat your other fish at some point, my oscars are about that size and can fit half a goldfish in their mouth (the goldfish are like half the size of them)<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps<br>  ~Sincerly Cori~|`|JU3TLLYjaa	I don't know much about oscars other than that they will eat most other fish...You seem to have a lot of fish in there.<br>  <br>  the following website says to avoid Chiclids|`|25CAIGfeaa	oscars require acidic ph 6.5, african need 8.0. ph think about it............................|`|igpMQn0kaa	Oscars are South American, you mentioned African. They have different water chemistry.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	Sounds like you already have alot of fish in there already.  I wouldn't recommend an oscar.  I have a 75 gallon tank and all I keep in it are 2 oscars, 1 pacu, and 1 cichlid.  As all these fish tend to get big quickly I do not ever get more than that even when they are small.  I would say stick with what you have, they seem to be doing well and they still have some room to grow.
034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	I'm sorry but I agree with Alice.  He's sickle hocked and has a weak back and is slightly muscled behind.  His neck is thick and ties in too low at the shoulder.  He's very unbalanced, front to back.  He's much heavier on the forehand than I like to see which will make it hard for him to drive from behind.<br>  <br>    He has much better muscling and definition in his front end, than in his back end.  I personally like to see a more correct hock set behind, not posty, just correct, and his is not.  He has straight legs in front and a pleasant looking expression, but I would pass him over, unless your mare has a really strong hind end.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  If you're set on a roan colored stud check out<br>   www.b-kquarterhorses.com<br>  <br>    They have a lot of foundation bred mares and a couple of studs.  One is a red roan son of Shining Spark and he's really pretty nice.  I know the couple and they are very nice people.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	Sticking to the question:<br>  <br>  This is a very mediocre gelding prospect.<br>  <br>  The only outstanding quality he has is color.<br>  <br>  None of his immediate ancestors have any show/performance records.  i.e. nobody ever heard of them.  Had they any outstanding (superior) qualities they'd have show records.<br>  <br>  Their ad doesn't show anything more than a somewhat organized Back Yard Breeder..<br>  <br>  The mares are not presented to their best advantage, let alone in a professional manner.<br>  <br>  His pictured foals are second generation medocre.  He does not produce better than himself or the mare.  To do so is required of a quality stallion.<br>  <br>  You don't show your mares' pedigree or photo.  Hopefully she's superior to this stallion you propose to downgrade her with.<br>  <br>  If this horse is what you consider quality, Heaven help us.  Look past the roan color, he's got nothing to offer.<br>  <br>  BTW, Foundation QH's are on the small side.  If he's 91% foundation, why is he 16.2?  If you don't want junk, DON'T breed to this horse.|`|7cm4dZVaaa	I'm on the same train as the other posters.  I think he is mediocre at best.  He is downhill, has no hip, and his "champion hunter under saddle" is at the "first ever roan show."   Its your mare, and you can sure breed for whatever you want, (and I didn't see what the stud fee is), but I think you can find a better stallion at any price.|`|psNR7hDJaa	Does your mare have outstand conformation? Has she won any big things? Is there really famous horses in her pedigree? I think only those type of mares should be bred.There is lots of "backyard breeding" going on. I would suggest to just go buy a foal. There is tons on the market. It will also be cheaper than breeding(with the vet and everything).|`|0nos1iXlaa	I have had Quarter Horses my whole life & all I can say is.......THAT is a stud?<br>  Blinded by his color?  What color? I hate roans with the ugly bleached out coloring.<br>  But his back looks too long, too slight in the rear & hopefully it is just the picture, but is he over at the knee?|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	Is he a registered foundation QH? Has he tested negative for CEM?? his bloodlines are ok.  hes a beautiful color.   BTW people send horses for slaughter in every state.|`|jzKS5pxkaa	What breed is he? if you want a roan foal hes definatley a good choice according to his page he is good natured and would pass great temperment to the foals|`|rPPM5R3oaa	love the color.. body built a bit odd|`|vtWDH2U1aa	If you like him breed to him just remember you have to wait a whole year to see what you get and about three more before you can really take it out and show it. I was like you and decided to breed three years later i have a two year old that i have spent about $5500.00 dollars on and i could have bought a baby just like her for $800.00 as a yearling.|`|GQxkZMJDaa	His shanks look a little funny, but he seems to have pretty good comformation besides that.|`|r5XLbLpVaa	You should look up Cunningham, the conformation hunter....o'l find you a link!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	You just better love roan foals, if that's all he has.<br>  Your mare is the same breed as him, right?<br>  Can you afford to let another life into the world?<br>  You won't send it out to slaughter?<br>  You won't abandon it because you thought you had the cash but you didn't?<br>  He looks nice...<br>  But I've seen better conformation.<br>  The pictures are less than flattering.  I dont like the pictures at all.<br>  I suggest you ask for all 4 side pictures, because to me (in the last picture) he looks like he's cow hocked, block headed, and I just dont love him much...|`|4AfRTzRmaa	BEAUTIFUL LOVE the color!!!! He has good muscles but not in the front. He is pretty, just no built for jumping/eventing. You should (in your mind) create the perfect horse. Now take a look at your mare-find her faults, then look at the stallion you want and counter act the faults in your mare, so the faults shouldn't have any. So then your foal will have a bigger chance that they don't have those faults(if this makes sense :) sorry). Good luck!|`|3LXbUg1raa	He's alright, but not great as far as conformation goes.  He looks a bit heavy on the frontquarters, and I really don't like how far he stands under himself in the hindquarters...he looks sickle-hocked.  I also looked at some of his foals on the website...the photos aren't very good for conformation judging, but one of the offspring under the 'yearling' category looks to be extremely cow-hocked...I'd really want to see more of how his offspring turns out before breeding to him.<br>  <br>  I don't know much about hunter bloodlines, so won't comment there...but for conformation, I've seen better and would hesitate a bit at breeding to him.|`|HCuArmpGaa	I don't really like his conformation that much but it is hard to see in that photo. I love the colour and he seems to have good bloodlines. I also have a bay roan! I love the colour! good luck and sorry i couldn;t be much help. Just make sure you ask for a LFG, look at his past foals to see what your future foal might look like (conformation errors, etc). Good luck with the foal!|`|sbB0TpGXaa	Too sickle hocked.  his back legs are too far underneath him.  He also looks a little heavy to me on the front.  But I am not a QH person so....|`|u1HahCoqaa	I think he's kinda ugly, and built downhill.....but that's just me.  You don't have to listen.
ejj2N3uaaa	Since she's gaited, I'm not sure how much of this can be accomplished with these suggestions--but this is what you would do for a non-gaited horse.<br>  <br>  Do some lateral flexion exercises before you ever actually move--pull one rein firmly but gently until she gives to the bit. Continue the pressure until she reaches around and touches your leg; immediately release the rein. Repeat on the other side. Do it on each side several times until she flexes as soon as you pick up the rein. That will encourage her to drop her head/neck and relax through her back, which will help with...<br>  <br>  Going long and low--as you're walking/trotting (uh, gaiting...if possible?), encourage her to stretch down and move out. You want her to round over her back and use her hind end. Lots of transitions will help build hind end strength so she can do this more easily. Lunging in side reins (if you're experienced with this?) can also help teach a horse to move in the correct frame and therefore build the correct muscles (making it easier for them to do it when you're on them) but I don't know how it would work for a gaited horse.|`|psNR7hDJaa	I agree with "Smile!"|`|S78sVWEVaa	Would this be the same mare diagnosed with.jugular thrombosis and/or jugular thrombophlebitis?<br>  <br>  Gaited horses are no different than any other horse.  They simjply have an extra gait.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	My mare always gets her headset automatically- she gives her heart for it.<br>  But in your case, I am guessing that yours doesnt if you are asking.<br>  You should work on headset, collection, and just all the stuff you would usually do.  Maybe, just maybe, walking/trotting over small logs will help, because they naturally go into headset over jumps- USUALLY.<br>  Not always.  But with all of my horses (most) they do.<br>  I can't help you any farther than here :(  sorry.|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	I don't know what your trails are like but troting up hills and walking down them really help build your horse's rump and topline mussles.<br>  <br>  **MAKE SURE THE FOOTING IS GOOD
enC9TvxUaa	-As long as it is cooked, no problem!  The uncooked, although urban legend says differently, does not harm them.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	No, feeding rice to birds doesn't kill them.  That is a myth about birds exploding if you feed them rice.  Pet birds can eat cooked rice, along with birdseed, fruits and vegetables, for a well-balanced diet.    In addition, many migrating ducks and geese depend on rice fields to get strength for their flight back north.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	i heard it does if they drink water|`|vwC7klVVaa	You should never feed rice to birds it is dangerous .|`|T2rU15Nsaa	it depends. If they eat a large amount of uncooked rice, it will expand in their crop when they drink water and can cause a dangerous amount of swelling. If it is fed cooked it will do no harm. It should only be fed as a supplement to a healthy diet, which is different for each species of bird. Do some homework on the type of bird you have and feed accordingly.|`|XspzL3LQaa	No feeding them rice will not kill them, but if you feed them things like Rolaids will. Here in California if you feed them anything that you know can or will kill an animal that's a crime!|`|QK4Yzp83aa	if they drink after wards it will make the rice bloat really big in their belly, i'm not sure it would kill them though been as bread also bloats|`|tSHo5vVZaa	yes   but only if it is raw  it can expand their stomach  and cause death|`|0Wn5EwaWaa	I recommend feeding cooked rice to birds. Rice will not kill a bird that is an urban legend http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/...   Cooked rice and pasta is actually healthy for parrots mine eat it all the time.|`|S6zCbVpHaa	No, of course not! Some, like the Java Sparrow, will even eat almost nothing but rice in the wild for some period of the year!  Feeding rice, especially paddy (unshelled rice) will be highly appreciated by many seed eating birds.  I feed paddy to mine and they usually eat it first.|`|Zh1Y6lFIaa	Cooked brown rice is actually a very healthy treat for pet parrots. Read about it here; http://jamiesparrothelp.wordpress.com/20...    Just make sure the rice is cooked for healthy and safe results when feeding it to birds.|`|bYPfFCr4aa	feed rice but it should be coooked|`|76834697406f46fddc8a871d4856248baa	No, but it's likely depending on the size of the bird you're feeding (and the size of the rice) to get stuck in the bird's throat.  That's why feeding birds something no larger than a bread crumb is generally not recommended.
XurYYreBaa	Definately handle the rats before adopting them.  It's good to know their ages & where the store gets them but it's been my experience that most pet store employees don't know.<br>  Watch the rats in their enclosures before handling them.  Good signs are clear eyes, a healthy looking coat & active rats (unless it's nap time).  Signs of possible illness include a lot of scratching, a shabby looking coat, dull or sunken eyes, a reddish discharge around their eyes or nose (this resembles blood), or mushy poop.<br>  When handling the rats, check for sores & lumps.  Also make sure the little guys don't seem unusually light/thin, but fairly solid.  Hold them close to your body so they'll feel more secure & talk to them in a calm friendly voice.<br>  When you're deciding who to bring home with you, look for 2 who are obviously friends.  Once I spent several minutes chasing a nervous rat b/c she'd been cuddling with the dumbo we were adopting & we didn't want to separate them.  The "nervous" one settled in with us within a couple weeks & her friend took to us immediately.|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Petsmart is horrible. Look someplace else.|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	Well if this is your last option then make your choice wisely. Ask to handle the rats. If they seem to nervous(expect them to be a little seeing as your a stranger and a petstore isn't the most calming place) then you know they aren't handled very often. Only get these ones if you know you will be able to tame them down. That may take time. Second, pick them up and do a check over them. Check their eyes to make sure they're clear. Check their ears to make sure they don't have mites. Check their teeth to see if anything is abnormal.Check their feet for any issues and check the overall body to make sure they are good weight. Ask if the males and females are kept together. If they are there''s a  99% chance all the females will be pregnant. Ask how old they think they are, how long they've been there, and where they came from. If you have a bad feeling about getting a specfic rat from a place then don't get it. Be patient and i'm sure you'll find the right ones for you. Good Luck|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Some of the pet rescues would meet you or drive to where you live. If your parents arent willing to assist you in your desire to adopt a rat then how would they feel if it got sick? Would they help pay for the expenses and vet bills? If not then it would be best to wait. You need to do whats best for your pet as well even if its not yours yet. Try Craigslist in your area too! Hope this helps and good luck...|`|FmIAKDJLaa	See if theyre held everyday and ask if you can hold them. Go for the ones that arent as skitish and seem happy. Also ask where the rats came from and how old they are.<br>  <br>  Edit: I also agree youd do better with petfinder.com|`|renZ4mvWaa	I am actually in a similar situation! I'm looking into getting rats too, but the only places that have them around me are pet stores. I am actually going to be taking a 2 hour trip this weekend to look at some in a humane society north of me, so hopefully they'll have some I like. <br>  <br>  Onward to your question... Unfortunately, pet stores are generally really bad places to get pets. I wouldn't suggest getting rats from them at all, but at least do a little research on this issue before you make up your mind. If you're absolutely going to, make sure you ask lots of questions about the rats first (how old are they, where were they bred, have they been handled much, etc. If the workers don't know, or can't easily find out, this is a bad sign). You also need to make sure you hold the rats some to see if they're friendly and inquisitive, and check them over for any abnormalities (such as sores or lumps). <br>  <br>  However, before you decide to buy a rat from a pet store, I would suggest waiting a while. I'm sure some rats will show up somewhere else around you sooner or later, even if it takes a few months. I've been looking for rats for about eight weeks now and only just found the ones two hours away earlier this week. Finding the right pet can take time. It might be a good idea to call local animal rescue groups or humane societies and tell them what you're looking for. Many of these types of places will be happy to call or email you if any rats come in. You could also try posting want-ads online, around town, or in a newspaper.<br>  <br>  Good luck finding some!|`|v67Oyaukaa	If your going to buy a pet your mom has to be they're or, you have to be 16 years or older.

I3V7hE32aa	I think it may still be part of the egg membrane.  While in the egg, the duck was surrounded by a memrane/sac.  As long as it isn't near the ducks bill, it should be fine.  Just leave it for a little while.  It'll just dry up and fall off.    From past experience with hatching ducks and turkeys, keep a close eye on any eggs that have started to hatch but not fully.  After several hours, if the duck hasn't been able to fully crack through the shell, meaning there is just a small hole in the egg, the membrane can dry up around the duck and suffocate it.  That happened to me before and I had to carefully break the shell and remove the membrane from around the bird.|`|4371771fcb9827dfb87e8af49e606ea6aa	i believe it is like their umbilical cord.

Your catfishes ate the lettuce proffered and promptly proceeded to produce a prodigious plethora of poop. :-) The "pleco" types (including your twig catfish) eat a lot and poop a lot.

3BMBZtDxaa	Yes!<br>  <br>  I don't see the problem, even if they eat poop or lick their private parts. I mean, you handshake with guys who "adjust" themselves daily, you have no clue what a person eats and they can give you a kiss on the cheek, and you face disease daily just by interacting with people daily. So why should you not allow your dog to show affection but let people?<br>  <br>  Besides, it's not like you let the dog lick you right after they lick their private parts! And their mouths don't hold the germs. <br>  <br>  And on a last note, people's mouths have a layer of bacteria surrounding their tongue. So every time you french kiss or someone licks you (I know, it doesn't sound possible but I've seen people lick each other!) you're getting it more than if you let your dog lick you.<br>  <br>  But that's just my two cents!|`|gUWcvxzuaa	You seen how a dog cleans it's ar$e right?

One of my dogs eats his own feces if he gets the chance.  Feces aside, all dogs enjoy eating disgusting things like dead animals or other animal's feces (I have NEVER met the dog who didn't enjoy eating cat or horse feces).  Who knows how long that stuff sticks to their teeth.  <br>  <br>  I don't freak out if a dog licks my face, but I really prefer not.  Aside from the whole hygiene thing I have a personal aversion to dampness on my face due to an old scar on my chin that tends to be prone to clogged pores.
6l9YAayqaa	I'm not really sure what to tell you, but this is what I see. A guinea pig that is either A.) extremely dominant or B.) just doesn't like to be bothered by people. Concerning A: was he the alpha pig when you still had the others with him? Was he the dominant one or was he aggressive at all towards the other pigs? <br>  <br>  I have had several guinea pigs over the years and I had one who just did not like to be touched or handled. She just hated it, so I left her alone. Everybody has their own personality including guinea pigs, maybe that's just him. However, seeing as this attacking behavior is highly unusual it may be wise to take him to a vet (a vet experienced with treating guinea pigs) to examine him. This could rule out any discomfort he may be experiencing that's causing him to act this way.|`|4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	Wow. <br>  <br>  Guinea pigs are NOT aggressive animals and because he is attacking you, I suggest taking that piggie to an exotics vet straight away for a thorough checkup. There must be a medical underlying cause for his behaviour. <br>  <br>  The only other explanation would be that he has been abused in the past and associates humans with fright and pain. If this is the case, only time, love, and patience will help him get over it.|`|1N73V2Ygaa	Hey!<br>  Here's what you should do:<br>  -First start practicing picking up your guinea. Clear everything out of the cage and put on a thick pair of glove. Gently corner him against a wall and pick him up without squeezing too hard. He will learn that biting won't do anything if you can't even feel it b/c of the gloves. <br>  -Then put him in your lap and gently brush him and pet him, w/ the gloves still on. Use the brush to practice touching his stomach b/c this is a sensitive area for guineas. it's a natural fear of theirs.<br>  -Once your guinea and you are both used to this, he will probablly stop biting once he has found out how not to get his.<br>  <br>  -Another thing is that he might be depressed or upset b/c his friends are gone. Guinea pigs are VERY social, so getting him friends might improve his behavior.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :-)|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	I rescued a guinea pig that had been abused. I want you to know that she turned out to be the best of all my pigs i ever had but when i got her she would bite me every time my hand was near her left side. <br>  <br>  I tamed her by using the towel trick. I would fold a towel in half so it was square. I then set her on it and raped her as you would a baby. I then held her against my chest over my heart, to feel and hear your heart is very comforting to guinea pigs.I found that lying down worked the best. I would unfold the towel so she could see me and pet the towel so she was getting petted through the towel, as i did this i would talk or sing to her softly. She would keep eye contact with me and would be very comfortable until she had to potty at which point she would wiggle around so i would put her back into the cage for 15 minutes and start over so i held her for at least two hours.Very soon she no longer wanted to be in the towel but just lie on my chest, but still bit me if my hand was close to her left side. Every time she did so i simply picked her up and kissed her right on the mouth and talked loving to her, i never reacted in a negative manner as that would have shamed her. It only took 6 weeks for her to figure out that her mouth was for kissing not biting and she loved to cuddle up and kiss me. People will say that animals do not have the ability to to reason but i have to tell you that little girl was so great full for her new life. She would lie on me and purr for hours at at time, she had to travel with me, where i went she wanted to be also.She had a way of letting me know how appreciative she was. She was 1 1/2 to 2 years old when i saved her so please know that you have hope and it will not take long!!<br>  <br>  Good luck and much joy!|`|nPdKJyK4aa	He might be lonely you can have guinea pigs that live together great. Or they prefer to live NEXT to other piggies or they cant stand other piggies at all. If you give him time and lots of love then he should come around. First leave him alone as much as possible. Try taking a piece fresh fruit treat everytime you go to the cage. move your hand slowly and try to get him to take it from your hand. make sure he sees that is comes from you place it in front or near him if he wont take it from your hand. Once he takes it from your hand when he is eatting it move your hand closer until he lets to pet his head. When you do have to take him out to clean or whatever cover your hands. Move slowly and try to pick him up quickly without chasing him around. Hold him firmly next to your body with one hand on his but and the other around his chest. Hold him for a few seconds and keep giving him his favorite treats. Put him back gently.

OaaJ7o9Haa	Stress and illness can keep fish from eating. You'll want to check for other symptoms like clamped fins, sores, fin rot, etc. Also, platies will bully each other if there are only two, especially is it's one male and one female. Check out this website for some diagnosis tools http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/disease/    However, if you just bought your platies and put them in, you'll need to give them anywhere between 1-3 days to get used to their new home. I got my platies from a pretty healthy place and they all started eating after the first day. However, if you get them from a not so great store, they may be overstressed or sick and need more time to recuperate.|`|jtG41TXZaa	They could have constipation,therefore they dont want to eat.|`|HRHPmjtVaa	What are your: ph, Ammonia, Nitrites and Nitrates.

wQ32Eszhaa	Dear JAI first of all let me tell you that it is banned in india to buy or sell or even hurt any animal and or bird or even a fly. So there is no question of buying them. And if someone sells them he/she is doing crime and my suggestion is just stay away from buying or selling such innocent living-beings. Because it hurts them when they are locked in Cave. Why son't you think that if someone complaints against you for having such living-beings at your place and if suppossed you are found guilty and prisoned, How will you Feel? will you feel Freedom or ...?    So please let them enjoy their lives as they live.... let them enjoy their freedom...|`|J0N7KFTTaa	yes.

While it is unusual for dogs to have fecal accidents for medical reasons with normal stools it can happen.  If rawhides are not a normal treat for them they could have triggered a bacterial overgrowth which could make a dog feel the need to go urgently (although it is unusual to have an overgrowth and no diarrhea).  Fecal parasites such as worms or especially giardia can also cause an urgency.|`|HyulW3aiaa	5 poops overnight means overfed.If the dog must go,he will go.You must reduce his intake and always feed the same time no matter what.The quality of food is paramount because some foods are just bulk and no nutrition.1-2 poops a day is normal.Skipping feeding them for a day is also good.In the wild they wouldn't eat everyday.To me it sounds like the food formula has changed somehow. I used to have 14 pitbulls and sometimes had this problem when I changed brands of dogfood or the current brands quality deteriorated.I always mixed dried blood,meat offal from my butcher and rice. Rice and chicken is very good for them.Not too much liver cos it affects their skin.Try chicken and rice for 3 days and watch what happens.Has the dogs exercise been reduced. More exercise more food.Less exercise less food. Logical. Make sure you can feel the ribs.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Start over with potty training.

In adolescence dogs do things that you thought you had trained them not to do.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	see vet- take a stool sample just to be sure<br>  but it may be anxiety over a new baby coming- give dogs credit they can tell when something is up- your vet may be able to Rx meds to see if this helps|`|6SeWCfUfaa	A change in behavior like that usually means a trip to the vet for any of my dogs.

GT6396BDaa	Dogs are very prone to UTI infections, especially females.  The signs that your dog has an infection, is if she's having to urinate a lot, even if not much urine comes out. and sometimes there may even be some blood in the urine.  You need to take her to a vet to be checked out and they can give your dog some meds including antibiotics to clear it up.  It should clear up within 4-7 days, but still give her all the meds so there won't be a reoccurrence of the UTI.  Also, make sure your dog drinks plenty of water.  It helps flush out her system.  Best of luck to your dog.  Hope I helped.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yes they can, call and ask your vet.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Yes.  Frequent urination is the most common sign.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Yes they can.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	yep.  When my chow had one (she was about 4 months old at the time) when she would roll over I would notice this really "gunky" type stuff on her...plus she was CONSTANTLY wanting to go to the bathroom...so I was having to take her outside about every 30 minutes...sometimes less than that...but most of the time she would barely even pee...and then it was a few drops here, move to another place, then a few more drops, then squatting 3-4 more times with nothing at all...|`|p7swtBYzaa	They sure can - signs are straining to urinate, frequent urination, blood in the urine.  Get your dog to the vet for a urine check, there are good meds that cure utis in dogs fast.  Don't let the poor thing suffer, this hurts and can cause kidney damage if left untreated.|`|FiFA3DNVaa	Is your dog a female? UTIs are most common in female dogs because the bacteria that causes them has a much shorter distance to travel than in male dogs.  Drinking lots of water it a big sign.  Urinating in strange places in another.    Your vet can take a sample and run a quick test to tell you. Antibiotics for a week is the most common treatment. Frequent UTIs could be a sign of a bladder stone. I just took my dog to the vet for a UTI check up. The check up and meds cost me about $70.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	yes they can get them a couple of signs are frequent urination or straining to go.|`|a1uoxczTaa	dogs can have a UTI. a dog i had one time would constantly squat to pee whenever she was outside. after peeing once, she barely peed again but kept squating. my cat also did that and was peeing any where she wanted.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	not peeing on a regular n having a hard time peeing would be ur sign|`|DJo0E2I2aa	yes, any animal with a urinary system (basically, any animal that pees) can get their tract infected, the signs are the same for humans, frequently and inability to go, take your dog to the vet and they can do a urine test and check for high amounts of bacteria
3BMBZtDxaa	Wow, all three are totally different! I don't know where to start!<br>  <br>  Honestly, I would go between Airedale Terrier or Aussie. I mean, St. Bernards are a handful even if they are amazing dogs, and they have their drooling and what-not. Obviously all breeds have their downfall, but a St. Bernard is a huge responsibility.<br>  <br>  I think she should research each one a lot, because Airedale Terriers and Aussies are so different from each other, that she should find which one goes better with her personality and life style, you know?<br>  <br>  But, if she's taking my opinion into consideration seriously, I must say Australian Shepherd all the way! I'm pretty biased on that one myself ;]<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2g5W67Ueaa	Saint Bernards they are soo lovable and friendly. very good dog breed :)<br>  I grew up with one as a child and he was like my best friend. <br>  You can make some fun memories with these dogs.<br>  not to mention they are adorable.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped you out!<br>  good luck <3.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	2.  Airedale Terrier|`|sMBuotwZaa	Without knowing her lifestyle, climate, and amount of time its really hard to answer this question.  She needs to pick what is best suited for her.  <br>  <br>  My personal preference is an Aussie.  I have one and he is a total sweet heart and a doll, we got him because we wanted another larger dog but not to big (we have a boxer/greyhound and Mini Dachshund) and we wanted a dog that could GO!  We camp A LOT as well as do a lot of hiking and spending time outside in the summer.  Plus we have a lot of access to dog sports and a breeder who will help us get involved once we are through our obedience training.<br>  <br>  We wanted a high energy on the go dog that could keep up with our lifestyle and we would still feel comfortable hiking with.  We wanted agile as well. Our mix is to clumsy for some of our hikes.  The aussie is perfect, and the Dachsie can hold his own unless its a of climbing.<br>  <br>  Tell her to research the breeds, and seriously assess her lifestyle.  And have her base her choice off that.  It will pay off for her in the end.|`|ORe8qdtTaa	Sorry but they are such differnt breeds that its hard to choose - surely it should be down to the lifestyle that you sister leads and can offer a dog!

Consider indoor outdoor size of compound and home alone?  Saints get hot real easy, shed lots  so if you don't brush him often he will get dense dead under coat making him harder to bath clean and dry.  Saints are very territorial and trying to break up a fight when a 150 plus pound dog is involved is hard.  They can also be over protective of property and people.  Remember to crimp the tail to try to get them off someone or another dog.  Most likely he will not associate the pain with anything else but the fight he is in but it might make him turn his thoughts a little.  I have had Saints<br>  <br>  Airedale I have not had but research them for high energy and maintenance. Also consider what he was breed for as this contributes to his behavior.<br>  <br>  Aussie good energy  but not over hyper.  Good with people and other dogs cats and farm animals.

They are fun little animals to play with. But be warned if you dont handle them everyday they tend to become biters and lets not forget you will have to bath it weekly because of the musky smell.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Ferrets are a little like cats, and a little like dogs, and yet very unique and different. They are lovely pets, very playful and sweet, but they are VERY hard to look after...expensive, and they need about four hours attention every day, and that doesnt include half an hour of cleaning up after them every day. I suggest you read the book "ferrets for dummies" before you decide further. Two excellent free care guides, "Ferret FAQ" and "Fert man" can be found by googling.|`|XT4MPPewaa	Ferrets are amazing pets, great with kids too (no younger than 8).  They aren't scarded of humans making them very easy to train.  Don't bite like people say they do(unless NEVER held or abused).  Do have a slight smell but not as bad as everyone makes out, about the same "level" of smell as a dog.  Easy to litter train, just leave some of its poo in a litter tray(always make sure the litter tray is in a corner, they always poo in corners).  They eat almost anything, eggs top class treat but only feed them once a week.  Need time out of cage, hour a day at least, and if no other ferrets live with it, it needs human contact.  Any other questions just email me, i know pretty much everything about ferrets.|`|AA11097657	They make good pets for the right people.     I have 4.     You must get them spayed if female or neutered if male.  Females will die if you don't. They come into season and won't come out again unless mated. This causes them to die from anaemia.    Males get aggressive if they are not neutered.     They need to come out and play everyday in a secure place. In the house is great if you don't mind the smell!  Get them used to a harness and you are well away. You can take them for a walk down the street.    Here is a good site for all the info you need.    www.all-about-ferrets.com|`|ZHWo2du2aa	get a dog / cat. no - ferrets are NOTHING like cats. if a dog would be left alone all day, get a cat - would suit u perfect :-)  you cant really cuddle ferrets im afraid. think long hamster!|`|0b1fa9ca19ef34843cb9155776450abaaa	Get 2 ferrets, ferrets need company and when your not around they'll have each other.    Ferrets are like kittens all they're life, always wanting to play and getting into mischief, always making you laugh. They need loads of handling and interaction and will need about 1-4 hrs play out of their cage/hutch each day.    You'll need to have them neutered/castrate at 6 months old which will help prevent early death in 'Jills' and possible aggression in 'Hobs'.  It will also reduce they're smell greatly. There is no need to wash them often as some say, as this just makes the ferret smellier for a few days after as they have to replace their natural oils in their cost. As long as their cage/hutch is kept clean, there'll only be a slight smell.    Your best bet is to go along to your nearest ferret rescue and they'll give you all the advice you need and you can also hold a few ferrets to see how they handle.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Ferrets are very high maintenance! They are messy and they poop all over and they need a ton of attention. They have a smell that bothers some people. You need to clean out their cage a lot to keep the smell down. They need several hours outside of their cage every day, the more the better. Some ferrets, especially babies, have biting problems. They will eat birds or any other animal smaller than themselves. Their vet bills will be more expensive than other animals and your normal vet might not see ferrets.    In some ways they are a bit like cats. They play like cats, and sometimes with the same toys. They are curious and will get into things. Some people say their ferret will cuddle with them but my 2 ferrets aren't that affectionate.    So...get a ferret IF you don't mind the time it takes to take care of it, and if the mess and smell is something you can handle. They are a lot of fun. You should adopt one from a ferret shelter instead of a pet store. Ferret shelters are all over (do a google search for one) and their animals are healthier and better trained than pet store ferrets.    I'm giving you a link to a chart that ranks all the kinds of ferret food. I use the Ferret Store kind of food because it's good quality and with shipping it's still cheaper than other kinds. And a website that has some good information for ferret owners.    The first person who posted is wrong about a couple of things. Cat food doesn't meet their nutritional requirements, they need a food higher in fat and protein and low in fiber. Also it's bad to bathe a ferret often, and it will actually make them smell worse because their body will produce more musk after bathing strips the natural oils from their fur.
CkecSp4Uaa	Large.  German shepherds and Alaskan malamutes are BOTH large breed dogs.  A dog that is a mix of those two breeds can not be considered anything less than large (unless her growth was severely stunted).  At 27 1/2 inches she almost qualifies as a GIANT breed (which is over 28 inches)!  Medium breed dogs are generally under 50lbs and definitely under 20 inches at the shoulder.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	Definitely large.

OyNJTWaiaa	Yes of course you can. If the mesh or bar spacing is correct for the bird and the access door and perching or platforms are easy to adapt and use, no reason why you cannot. I have seen some of those reptile cage and they are well made and strong and very much like a bird cage anyway. So if it is right for you and your birds and the price is right...go for it.|`|GSf09ALBaa	No.  These cages are designed specifically for the animal.  A bird needs a bird cage.  Don't put a bird in anything but a bird cage.  Please.  You can get away with putting reptiles (especially snakes) in other cages but do not do this to a bird.  <br>  <br>  I have had numerous snakes and different lizards.  They were all housed in the proper Vision cages.  My bird has a kick butt bird cage and some serious toys.|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	I'm only going to say no because you mentioned an African Grey. You're severely underestimating your Grey's beak power. They could mutilate and break those bars no problem. Even if he doesn't make a hole large enough to escape from, he could severely injure himself. If you can't afford a proper cage, what makes you think you can afford emergency medical care if that happens?<br>  <br>  You should check the internet for "affordable" African Grey sized cages- but keep in mind that you're probably not going to find one for under $150. I got mine for about that price, and with it's play stand is a little taller than I am. <br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that maybe if you can't afford an proper cage for your African Grey, then maybe you should hold off on getting an African Grey until you can afford it.<br>  <br>  If you're going to do this, you might as well do it right.|`|UPYLko2baa	I suppose it would be ok if it is large enough for the birs to be able to flp its wings without hitting htem on the cage ... also make sure thst the spacing in the cage is small enough that your bird won't get its head caught. 1/2 an inch apart for parakeets3/4 inch for large birds. Hope that helps!
70yqZp3caa	Lol it sounds just like my puppy. Give him time, mine is 6 months and she is still learning! Whill teaching him to sit, hold a treat in the air and say sit firmly, then push his butt down. Keep doing that, he'll catch on. While doing lay, wait for him to sit, then gently push him in a laying positon while saying "LaY!. for him to roll over, wait till he latys, roll him over while saying "Roll over" And myu favorite, shake! Take hold of his hand while him sitting, and say shake (while the paw is in your hand)! He sounds like he's scared. take him out of his crate and spend quality time with him...i.e petting, sitting, that kind of stuff, for the bathroom it takes awhile, When he does it in the wrong place, say no firmly and takwe him out! Keep calling his name over and over all the time! he'll learn it eventually!

AraBfesHaa	First off you should have cycled the tank before you got the fish.  But really, even without cycling first, you could have had some healthy fish.<br>  You added too many to the tank all at once.<br>  You can start the tank off with Cycle or Stability, and add one or two fish, checking the ammonia level every day.  Do partial water changes when the ammonia is high and/or use ammonia neutralizer (You can use Stability and Prime at the same time-=Prime will take care of the chlorine/chloramine, and ammonia/nitrites/nitrates.  <br>  Once you have the ammonia/nitrite/nitrate level back to zero, you can add another fish or two, and repeat with the ammonia testing.  repeat until you have the tank stocked.  But besides adding too many fish at once, your tank was overstocked anyway, and that leads to ammonia poisoning because of the ammonia spikes they caused.<br>  The algae won't kill the fish, that's a secondary problem.  In fact, some fish will eat the algae, as will the snails you have.  <br>  I would say that with a 10 gallon tank, a school of 6 or so tetras would be plenty.<br>  Don't get any livebearers unless you only get males, or are prepared to buy plenty of more tanks to house them all because they WILL breed and have up to 80 fry at a time, and every 4 weeks for up to 6 months with just one mating. And chances are extremely high that if you buy a female, it's already pregnant.<br>  Goldfish need at least a 30 gallon tank, and that's just for one.<br>  Plecos, the common ones you can buy at any local pet store will grow to 2' and need at least a 55 gallon tank.<br>  Don't get sharks of any kind for a 10 gallon tank.  They won't last long, no matter what the pet stores may tell you.<br>  And fish will eat dead fish in the tank, as will the snails, so you need to remove them as soon as you see them.  And decaying fish will bring all sorts of other trouble to the tank.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Here's your problem. If there is alot of algae then your water quality is poor. You need to perform a 50% water change. I have a feeling that your ammonia,nitrates and nitrites are high as algae is a sign. Also the bloddy side is a sign of ammonia poisioning this is where the actual skin start to burn from too much ammonia exposure. <br>  <br>  Once you've done a 50% water change then perform weekly water changes of 25%. If you have any gold fish then 40% weekly changes since they produce too much ammonia. Sorry for your loss this happened to me before I understood the cycling process.<br>  <br>  I would highly advise you getting all-in-one test strips ($10) to make sure your water stays in the safe range. Otherwise, you will be wasting alot of money on your fish.<br>   <br>  Good Luck=)|`|qEPdwQIkaa	did you get the fish the same day you put water in your tank?

I would answer this question myself but I will be just repeating what she has said. One thing I will say though is that next time introduce the fish a little more slowly. Obviously the place you bought them from didn't given you very good advice, my LFS recommends leaving it for a week or two between adding fish (so add 3 one week and then another 3 two weeks later).<br>  <br>  It sounds like the tank wasn't cycled which means you'll now have to 'start again'. Give it a good clean, get some water conditioners (and algae killer) and then leave the tank running with the filter on for a few weeks before adding fish again..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  **************EDIT********************...<br>  <br>  This website might possbily help <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/maintenance1/p/algaebrown.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/mainte...</a><br>  I would suggest trying to get a refund at the store though, as most fish come with a guarantee of a week or two, and they really should have advised you correctly.|`|tedJD26Uaa	OMG we have a 10 gallon tank to and I will help you alot my fish lived perfectly. First of all you have way too many fish in your tank its like every 2fish per gallon they say. dont get goldfish avoid those cause they die often quickly the fish that i would recommend are at least 2 Agility eaters(germ eaters) and at least have a plant in there so that they can eat it.You can buy any other fish you wont make sure there not aggressive and try to eat the other small fish.  have a HEATER that is one of the most important things you can have the water may become too cold for the fish. Also another really important thing is Oxygen bubbles you need to buy alot of Oxygen bubbles that helps your fish live longer and happier. Hope that helped:)|`|1orBemFyaa	brown algae is good, red is bad algae.<br>  all the rest, i cant help with.  sorry!|`|AA10904176	Brown algae is from 2 possible sources: Too much sunlight and rotting food, fish waste. The neon tetra are food for the glass catfish, sorry. But it is possible they are eating the dead fish for food. Fish eat fish, and fish waste. Also, 6 big fish in a new aquarium (I assume) is too many. The tank that size can handle 2-3 fish with adequate filtration, air etc. Remember the aquarium needs to have the right bacteria to start with. So if you just threw them in together, that is probably what killed them. You probably did not adapt them to your water long enough. There are books and pet stores that can help with a proper aquarium start up. Don't give up on fish, just study and ask questions about this hobby.

unVj43Xxaa	If she's sound then more than likely it's just the fluid in her joints that acts as a lubricant. The fluid contains the gases oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. When she takes a step the gases are released causing a popping or cracking sound. I've seen young horses that have never been worked have the same then. If there's no trauma or soundness issue I'd just keep her on the supplements and not worry unless you see other issues occur.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	if you feel very worried about it, then you COULD get the vet out.<br>  Maybe you should give joint supplements.  That should help the joints movement.<br>  I havn't heard of this before, but I do think that joint supplements and that a vet check won't do any harm.<br>  When working her, dont work her too hard.  Just in case.
S2b2Wpzuaa	There could be a couple reasons for this.    I had a cat who had some skin problems, rashes, dryness, flaking - we took him to the vet, and the vet prescribed him Ovaban (it's a birth control pill...even though he was a guy) it could have been a hormonal problem.    Your kitty might be having some allergic reactions to his environment.    I would definitely take him to a vet - they would be able to identify if it is a fungus, allergy, dehydration, etc.    Good luck to you and your flaking feline!  Hope he gets to feeling better.|`|GduRpnn0aa	A cats skin may be irritated if it has a rash, is dry and/or flaking, greasy, red, swollen or itchy. The causes of cat skin irritation and disease are numerous; these include environmental toxins that can irritate the skin, poor nutrition, mineral or vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid and kidney disorders. During the healing process of cat skin diseases, skin eruptions or irritation are normal and are indicative of the healing process. Cat owners should pay close attention to the pets environment such as his bed or sleeping space which should be examined frequently and cleaned or changed when necessary.     You should use Feline Ouch Away on your cats skin, as the healing herbal treatment found in it can be helpful in clearing the irritation and any disease while boosting your cat's immune system.

RA3p25Qoaa	The purple claw is the species indicator not gender indicator. <br>  The painted shell is no good he really needs access to natural shells so he can change when he's ready. painted shells kill and harm land herimt crabs. <br>  <br>  You tell gender by looking at their underbelly and if there is a dot on each of their last set of legs then it is female no dots it's male. <br>  <br>  It may not be moving because it's still new to the tank. If it's alone that could also explain it.  If you only have a sponge and no proper salt and fresh water dish it will not be as active. If the food is the same thing all the time it will be less interested.  If the humidity is below 70% then it can't breath and if an animal can't breath it won't be active. If the tank is below 70f it won't be active because it's too cold. <br>  <br>  What you can do. <br>  Provide the crab with fresh and salt water ( aquarium salt not table salt) <br>  If he has no friends get him friends<br>  try feeding him fruit, vegetables, egg shells, krill, brine shrimp, bones, and small amounts of meats. No table salt, preservatives, commercial crab food, or overly starchy foods. <br>  buy a humidity gage and measure the humidity making sure it always stays over 70%<br>  Buy an under tank heater and make sure the temperatures stay between 70F-80F ideally 75f-80f<br>  <br>  make sure he has lots of sand or coconut fiber substrate and natural shells. shells should be boiled prior to use. sand should be cooked for 20 minutes at 420f  and cooled prior to use. <br>  <br>  you need a 10 gallon glass tank with glass lid. plastic tanks are death traps.|`|r0u26SYGaa	that means he/she is a purple pincher hermit crab, which is a species. how you find out the gender is by the genepores. genepores are little holes on the outer legs-where the are attached to the body. females have genepores, and males don't. do you mean her/his shell is painted? paint is Poison to hermits and kills them. even if it is "non toxic" they eat it and eventually-after a year or 2, die. offer shells, and make sure you have a deep substrate, so it can bury itself. they start to act slow when they need to molt, so that might be the reason. you can read up on molting and outer molting here: <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkEPUClmynWURhhfiuH1R5LAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090218204654AAXQPVG&show=7#profile-info-GWQWceZzaa">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  good luck!|`|o66jqnraaa	that is very normal hermet crabs only move around at night because i had one and he diddn't move that much.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s they love bananas

I have guinea pigs and rabbits and I don't see much of a price difference in their foods.|`|TnQEOdX0aa	It's not terrible to do, but guinea pigs need more calcium than rabbits do, so you might want to get a calcium supplement for him/her.<br>  Vegetables and fruits are also very good for them. But nothing with too much citric acid, like tomatoes, oranges, or anything like that.|`|I9YgbXe5aa	it's fine. a lot of foods like have the same stuff and it says it can be used on multiple animals and it'll list the animals. some don't though, but it's perfectly safe.
4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	You really shouldn't scrimp on your pellet budget if you can help it. Pellets are an important source of Vitamin C, fiber, and nutrients for your piggie. The cheap pellets with coloured bits and seeds are garbage. Your piggie needs plain green pellets with stabilised Vitamin C.<br>  <br>  Any dark green leafy veggie is great. Romaine lettuce, parsley, cilantro, red or green curly lettuces, endive, escarole are good choices. Spinach & kale should be fed sparingly due to high calcium content. Cabbage & broccoli should be fed sparingly also, as they cause gas. Tomatoes and bell peppers (capsicum) of any colour are another good source of Vitamin C.|`|nPdKJyK4aa	If you buy cheap food they will live shorter lives and be less healthy.

There's no way around it. Oxbow is the only brand out there that's really formulated correctly for guinea pigs. <br>  <br>  However, I have good news. Hay can be inexpensive, you just have to work a little more to get it. It is MUCH cheaper to purchase hay by the BALE (a real 40-55 lb bale). Look online for hay farmers/suppliers or a feed mill in your area for good quality timothy hay. The cost for a 50lb bale of hay ranges, but the average right now is $5/bale. So that's $5 for 40-55 lbs of hay which will last you months as opposed to the $15 weekly you would spend on a 96oz bag from the pet store. It is more cumbersome to store though. A dry place in a garage or shed is ideal, or if indoors a large open plastic container will do.<br>  <br>  As far as what vegetables to try- any green leafy vegetables like endive, romaine, swiss chard, spinach, and escarole are all great. Really try to avoid any brussels sprouts, peppers, broccoli, cabbage or cauliflower as they all cause gas. I don't really think there are any really harmful veggies to feed except that I have heard rhubarb is toxic to guinea pigs.

LPEO6AsCaa	I would not leave her alone from this point on.  some dam's continue to release their mucus plug right up to the time they start to whelp.      Temp is only one indication that a dam will go into whelp soon.  It is not a 100% determining factor.  If she is displaying other signs then she needs to be watched carefully to see if she will whelp earlier than you anticipated.  Get all your whelping supplies in order and handy just in case she starts to whelp.  Good luck and keep a close eye on her ok!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Please call your vet or mentor for advice, rather than trusting your dog's health and safety to a bunch of random strangers on the internet.    EDIT: This site is NOT for dispensing medical advice.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Call your vet NOW - and your mentor, I suppose you have a mentor for this so perfect specimen that you just HAD to breed her.    You can't spell the breed name, but you are breeding more - not being mean here, just honest - you have a dachshund, dachs means badger and hund means dog - not that you care.  Please believe me that there are more honorable ways to make a few bucks than off the suffering of animals.  Get some vet help, find good homes of the pups - should they and the mother dog be lucky enough to survive your clueless ministrations - and then get her spayed.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	And you're not consulting your Vet because...?????|`|C1eHfhrHaa	How about if you call the vet and ask?

3u6iJ9vhaa	Hard to say. Ellen always says "Him", but sometimes just "it".

It looks like a male to me for some reason.It's a big cat.
1tX7KwHsaa	Definitely get her vet checked and do a few trial runs with her. TB's can be a handful sometimes but then again the little girl who is sitting out of her seat with her arms around the mares neck tells me otherwise. No child would unseat themselves to give a hug if they were on a flighty or edgy mare. The thing that gets me about the mare is the cheap price for such a trained horse. Take a trusted friend or trainer with loads of experience and have them try her out along with you. Experienced trainers and riders will me more apt to pick up on conformation flaws and training areas that may have been over exaggerated. But then again she may just have owners who need to find a new home for her quickly... You never know! Just don't jump in head first and I'm sure you'll make the right decision! Good Luck!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	in the pictures, she is below the bit.  She has a very low head carriage, which is not beneficial. She sounds nice, other than the head carriage thing, but I am wondering why they have no conformation pictures.  Ask for some riderless, tackless, front, hind, left, right pictures.  You need to take a look at her head, side (from a standing position) and hind (hocks need to be good)<br>  I suggest that you definitely get a vet check and try her out (Maybe a few times, she is a mare, so her cycles.. and a thoroughbrd, so yeah)<br>  She's a looker!|`|4AfRTzRmaa	I really like her although im wondering why do they have her only as 2k, she should be 10k even though shes off the track. She jumps 2'3 and does dressage, and is only 8! well give her a check out though :)|`|CBrsrL5vaa	She looks like a gorgeous girl.  But there are a few things to keep in mind when buying thoroughbreds, ecpecially ones like that for only 2k.  Definitely go try her out before you buy her and maybe ask for a two week or so trile so you can see how she works out where you live and you can see more of her personality.  Also get exrays and a vet check.  Some things to keep in mind for thorough breds is that they can have thier little moments and they can spook or just get plain stubborn.  Also, thorough breds have weaker joints in thier legs so they tend to get lame more easily.  I really hope your search for your horse works out!  Good luck!|`|XsBIITFvaa	Either the first rider is really really tall, or she isn't quite 16 hands. But she seems like a nice mare. Have a thorough vet check and lease her for a month or so to see if she lives up to your expectations.<br>  <br>  beautiful mare. Hope she works out for ya. =D|`|psNR7hDJaa	She looks like a good horse. Go try her out. I wonder why they are selling her for only $2000 though. Make sure you get a vet check and that she doesn't have any health and big training problems.|`|2nsNvIanaa	go see irl 4 starters
qMO9S6kvaa	"Adult males have longer, more pointed fins. The female has a dark patch on the dorsal fin above the second-last band. Females are also generally paler in colour and don't tend to have the blue squiggles on the head."<br>   hope this helps

Call a dog behavioralist.  ASAP.
IuYekkPVaa	You should definitely take her to the vet as it's always best to rule out health problems when they start peeing outside the litter box.    If the vet gives her a clean bill of health, then it's possible that she's marking territory.  Cats aren't disgusted by the smell of their own urine, so it never occurs to them that we find it offensive. They find it comforting to be surrounded by their own scent, and normally they are content to chin rub to mark territory, but if they are feeling insecure urinating is a much quicker and stronger method of spreading their scent everywhere.      The web site below has a really helpful check list of 18 reasons why cats stop using their litter box, along with advice on dealing with territorial marking if it does turn out to be a behavioural problem.    http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...    Hope this helps.|`|H6B90UG5aa	Definitely take her to the vet to rule out a UTI (or any other urinary tract issue like crystals or kidney stones, etc).  If she comes back with a clean bill of health, she maybe just saying "I don't appreciate the way the 'new guy' (your BF) smells" & if that's the case, you'll have to decide if you're gonna ditch him or retrain her to accept him in her space.
TawyLobZaa	Been there, done that!!  I rescued from a terrible breeder a boxer puppy that's entire litter was so neglected that they were all full of worms and had coccidiosis to beat!! So of course he was skinny to begin with, but at about the same time as I was having him treated by the vet, he hit that awkward boxer growth spurt where they look skinny anyway. So the two compiled together made for one SKINNY dog. While he was on the road to being getting better and growing, I would have people stop me and complain r get on a moral high horse about how I needed to feed him or stop abusing him or give him away. Even had a person in the neighborhood knock on my door one day and DEMAND that I write her a paper saying I was giving her my dog because I was supposedly starving him!!  While my problem went away when he got all better and got out of the "puberty" stage, I realize your dogs breed and body type are not going to change. I suggest ignoring them. Or maybe carry around a pic of a saluki to show them they are naturally skinny looking dogs. And remember people just LOVE to point fingers about things they know nothing about. Good luck!!|`|xpRj7d0Jaa	just ignore em! tell em 2 go do one! if they dont know shes sposed 2 look like that then theyre stupid.   i love salukis i think theyre so beautiful. n half golden retriever ...bet shes so pretty :-)|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	tell ppl its her breed and she is very healthy.|`|PM23RDycaa	Point out that she is mixed with a very thin/lithe breed of dog and that she's only going to get as much weight on her that is healthy for her.    When all else fails tell them to kiss your a$$ and keep walking. The next time someone throws something whip out the cell phone and call the cops.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	A friend with a purebred Borzoi (Russian wolfhound) has had to deal with people accusing him of "starving your collie".  You could put a cute sign on his collar or on a doggie backpack on her back saying "I'm half greyhound - I eat well!"  Salukis are Persian greyhounds.  Generally just dog people know what Salukis are, but most people know what a greyhound is and that they're built like cheetahs.  Sometimes a little education and a little humor go a long way toward defusing a situation.      A friend with a Pyrennes has him wear a collar sign when he's in public.  It says, "I'm not a white St. Bernard!"|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Thanks for adopting.  Just ignore them.  You know the truth and people will believe what they want to.  If you feel the need to explain yourself, do it calmly and respectfully, otherwise no one will listen anyway.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Ignore them. If you were truly abusing your dog, you wouldn't be taking it in public places. It would be home alone, probably chained in the yard or left to wander in the yard. It might have a dog house and a water bowl, or it might not.    Sometimes it is hard to put weight on a rescue dog, especially an older one. What are you feeding her? I pulled a great dane a few months ago and he was about 83lbs. He needed to put on a good 25lbs +.     Luckily I live out in the sticks and my nearest neighbor is 30 acres away, so I didn't get any nasty comments. Three months later the vet and myself deemed him able to be up for adoption. He has found his forever family!    I would simply ignore them. People need to mind their own business. And I'm sure you have tried, but keep trying to feed her up. Add scrambled eggs to her diet, plain low-fat yogurt, boiled chicken, etc to her kibble.    Good luck!|`|p7swtBYzaa	Tell the dimwits that she is part Saluki and they are lean, coursing hounds.  As long as you know she is well fed, what does it matter what clueless busybodies say.   In one way, it is rather refreshing that people do get involved if they see what they think is a starved dog, too many dogs have been neglected and abused with no one saying anything.    In your case, don't get upset - I would thank them for caring  (that disarms people) and just mention what breed they are mixed with and state that they are thin dogs by nature.    Good of you to rescue an older dog, I have several, best thing I ever did, they are polite, loving, grateful for a good home.   I'm sure yours is too, if you are happy and your dog is happy, doesn't matter in the least whether strangers are happy, but here's your chance to educate them a bit.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Just imagine actually having a Saluki of correct weight.  Or an Afghan, whose hip bones are SUPPOSED to stick out.  A lot of people thought I was starving my Afghan.|`|7IVrBiT1aa	You go person!  I adopted all 5 of my dogs from shelters except for 1 that I found on the road and saved :)  The dog I found on the roads ribs were sticking out and I had no idea what to do!

(:|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	smile n wave or maybe point at them n laugh|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	just smile and calmy tell people her breed and that she's a rescue.    my first horse rescue, when i was about 10 yrs, after getting some weight on her to rebuild her strength, i decided to walk her to a nearby field so she could graze. while there, the police chief of our town happened by and started giving me a hard time about my horses condition. i had the surrender papers in my coat pocket from the previous owner and presented them.  he apologized and thanked me.|`|y2ywR3X9aa	tell them she is very healthy and thanks for the concern. Not every dog is going to be big they come in all shapes like people. My puppy is the same way he is a german shepherd/chow mix and he is quite thin.he is also tall and he eats very well but people think he is too skinny. I just tell them he is very lucky to have a high metabolism unlike his owner. Kudos to you for adopting. We got our boy from my uncle.|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	Sigh as a fellow sigh hound owner I relate   suggestions Carry a pic of a show winning saluki in your wallet (right next to the xyz kennel club show win sign) OCCASIONALLY this will work but unfortunately some people will not let mere facts interfere with a good opinion....    Stick a coat on the dog they- can't see then... I did this with a desperately thin recovering from illness whippet (an SPCA investigation would probably last 5 min and end after a phone call to my vet but why go through it....) Unfortunately this  is a problem in 80 degree weather     GIve them a huge song & dance - rescue haven't fed him up yet     Ignore them...|`|oeUvBzvkaa	Next time, just explain that you rescued her, and she's a saluki/golden retriever cross. A lot of people feel like they're being "helpful" by pointing out the obvious- she's skinny. Perhaps if you got a collar/leash/bandana with your rescue's name on it, people might understand slightly better? But some people take it way too far obviously, and i'm sorry you have to deal with that sort of abuse.     I volunteer at a shelter, and there is an old pb GSD who is skinny as a rail (pathetically skinny) but is fed barrelfuls- she just won't gain weight. So even if everyone doesn't understand, at least you know you've done the right thing.
H06PtiIAaa	no, because puffers may nip at hard corals and will feed on the inverts that make up the reef tank like shrimps and snails.|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	I don't think so. But there is a small chance there is though. Sorry! :(
AuM57Q7Aaa	Give them to a friend. Give them away on Craigslist. Bring them to a pet shop!|`|oTHGgowsaa	Tell them that it's just not working out, and you would like to get some new fish, but try and break it to them lightly. Be kind, but firm, give them a deadline to get out of the house and stick to it.|`|AraBfesHaa	If you still have the receipt, and the fish are healthy, try taking them back, by explaining they are too aggressive for the other fish in the tank (even if you don't have any others yet).  If they don't want to take them back, I'd tell them it's their fault for not warning you they are aggressive fish.  Of course, you have to return them w/in their time limits for returning fish.<br>  If that still doesn't work, try other fish stores in your area while they're still bagged up, providing they're not in the bag too long, and use the same reason for not wanting them.  Other stores may not pay you for them, but at least  you won't be killing them.<br>  Just curious, why did you choose that fish to cycle the tank with?

9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	Birds are known to poop and they poop around every 10 to 15 minutes depending on the bird. These are things to think about BEFORE getting a bird. Compared to any other pet Birds require the LONGEST commitment. <br>  <br>  Bird eating poop means it lacks some type of minerals, iodine or calcium. That is why the bird is eating poop and could also be bored. <br>  <br>  However, sometimes birds walk around the bottom of their cage just pecking at things...so the bird might not be "eating" poop.<br>  <br>  Also, keep the bottom of the cage clean just in case the bird is eating poop so no bacteria or any other germs are not being spread around.|`|RDsZFfLOaa	well of course they poop.|`|38sALve2aa	kk birds poop lik every 15 minutes. i hav one. they hav really fast digestive systems and he's not eating his poop, he's cleaning his cage.

9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	What type of bird? Be aware that when you get another bird you will most likely get ignored. But, now on weekend I'm sure you spend time with him? It might not be the same if you get another bird.<br>  <br>  Also if you get the opposite sex be careful because the female will get pregnant. It sounds like you do not have time to deal will all of that. So, if you are going to get a friend for your bird get the same sex. Do not start breeding them. <br>  <br>  Also, before getting another bird step it up for the bird in terms of toys, nice playpen, areas to explore or fly and relax when you are at school. Sort of turn your room into a room for him.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you will see a change.<br>  <br>  If you still want to get a another bird...get the same type of bird and the same sex and ADOPT..please. =)<br>  <br>  If you need more help finding a bird you can e-mail or message me.|`|ZotbP52paa	Yes try getting another bird. (Try looking up what bird you should get for it) Hope I helped!
SDHmVDlNaa	We have had this same problem.  My cat got some of that bad food that had melamine in it and has been having urinary track problems with crystals in his urine ever since.  He  was only a year old at the time. He needs the wet stuff all the time.     There is a dry special urinary cat food that Purina farms makes that is way less  expensive than the wet cat food.  It has something to do with ash content.  You have to look in the special cat food diet section of Walmart.  I have seen it there.  I also buy the canned urinary track health Purina farms cat food at Safeway and Shoppers Warehouse foods.  At  Shoppers it was forty four cents per can.  At Safeway it was sixty cents which is almost as much as baby food.  I have on occasion seen the wet canned food at Walmart.   Do you have any of those where you are?  Be sure and get the kind that is non fish.  Fish should be an occasional treat for a cat but you don't want to feed them fish every day as it may contain mercury. Hope this helps.  If you haven't tried the dry Urinary track food from Purina you should try that first as it is way less expensive. I have also been told by a friend that you can get someone to make up some special organic food at some smaller pet stores that are not chains.  They will sometimes order in the special stuff at the vets.  And one other thing I haven't tried yet.  You might contact Purina Farms directly and see how much it would be to order a case of the food.  It might be that they would give you a break in these bad financial times.  Hope this answer helps you.  Good luck in your quest.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Ken S. really has the best answer for you.  Remember the old adage "penny-wise and pound foolish".  If you don't stick with a quality wet food you will end up losing your cat or having nothing but constant veterinarian trips to "cure" him.    Along with Ken's links I would like to add:  http://www.littlebigcat.com so you can read some of Dr. Jean Hovfe's articles on cat nutrition such as "Why Cats Need Canned Food", "What Cats Should Eat" and "Urinary Tract Disorders in Cats".    I use a 50% raw diet and canned food with my four cats.  The price of the canned meat has gone up 30% in the last few months.  It is for me an "insurance policy" that they are healthy and don't have to go to the vet except for an annual exam once a years.|`|rLIFcjX6aa	Hey!  These are some pretty easy to digest cat foods, good luck!  http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/products/...  http://www.mysimon.com/9000-10992_8-0.ht...  http://search.onlynaturalpet.com/search....|`|S2b2Wpzuaa	I would not go for the cheap stuff -- but there are some good mid-range cat foods out there that would hopefully be easy on kitty's stomach.    I recommend Science Diet's sensitive stomach formula.  It worked wonders for my little guy.  Also, a plus for the better quality foods like that generally means less litter box waste!  The volume of poo in my box has gone down by about 25% after switching to Science Diet from Meow Mix.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Unfortunately that's the deal you have a sick cat that needs special care.. Call your vet and find out an alternative meal plan you can give your cat.. There are different types of cat foods out there..    If you can't afford the meals, you may have to surrender to a ASPCA shelter to find a family that can afford his special needs.    Also if you can monitor the feedings , the rest of the cats does not have to be on the same diet as this cat.|`|61PECjigaa	With 2 cats  understand your financial situation plus I have a teenage son. I would mix dry with some wet and then see if you can ween it til the blood stops. Is there blood in his stool, if so then I refer back to something internal and you might have to take him back to vets...is he an inside cat if so he needs more greens too. hope it helps Shelley|`|FlsrXuJOaa	i agree that you should mix the wet food with dry food. so you only are using half as much wet.|`|Amkmles0aa	call the vet   find a new vet  you may have to put it down  but try to save the cat plz|`|U2KdP1y7aa	Buy store brand wet food. It cost less and try online pet stores that might sell it for less.|`|LzZtdlc8aa	try dollar general or aldi's they are inexpensive and or mix it with dry food that should work|`|K0uTjeWiaa	First off, dry should never be moistened as it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria.  Next, when you count expense, don't forget to add vet bills in the cost of the food and if you feed dry, they will add up        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...
CdRlOsnyaa	if your feeding him to much maybe that cna happen if you just gpt him he might be nervous of his new surroundings you can call a reptile vet and see what they say, ts usually harmless just someting didnt agree with the snake he should be alright.|`|2vH6VktWaa	It probably get it the same reason that you would|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Diarrhea is when food moves too quickly through your body basically, and the liquids aren't being absorbed. There are many leading causes for this-- including stress. Now, why he's stressed is another question. There are a bunch of different factors that can be making him feel stressed-- and many different reasons he is having diarrhea! I'm no professional, but you may want to find the reason for stress or if it gets bad, take him to a vet.
OTxCCXa5aa	Coral reefs are mad up of thousands of tiny living organisms, they are very fragile and in many places they are dying out. Nowadays they are protected to prevent further damage and loss, so you aren't allowed to touch them, they can also give you a nasty sting and cut you or cause you injury. So its not just for their protection, but your own as well!|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Corals are living creatures.  They're soft polyps that live in hard and sharp-edged structures.  The lightest touch could kill hundreds of them.  If the coral dies, it will no longer provide a proper habitat for the fish and the whole reef ecosystem will suffer.  On top of that, some corals will give you a nasty sting, particularly fire coral.|`|1hciyvKdaa	The oil in our skin is damaging to many life forms in the ocean. Coral reefs are such an important lifeforce in the ocean.|`|M2II7hPNaa	because they are brittle and will break easily|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Some corals can sting you severely enough to really hurt.    You might also injure the coral.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	it will desease them they are living things and also it may damage them and make them die xxx|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	disease silly!!!! its a living thing and either you will kill it or it will kill you!|`|yU132xUvaa	because touching them can disruot the whole ecosystem and kill many species from the stuff on our fingers|`|NCBDNMLXaa	The short answer is that our touch damages the corals and if enough damage is done it kills the coral.    The most obvious damage is physical, as many corals are very delicate and break easily.  Whether it's a large section that breaks off or if the small walls that surround the coral polyps are broken/damaged, something that might not even be visible to your eye, the end result is the same....stress on the coral that opens the door for infections, parasites, algae growth, etc.    Less obvious but potentially more damaging are the oils on our skin that get left behind and damage the delicate coral polyps.  Again, these deposits stress the coral and open the door for all sorts of bad things to take hold.    On the other side of the coin, there's also the potential for you to get stung.  I've not tried myself and have no plans to do so, but I understand that fire coral will produce a rather irritating rash.    Although the main reason for not touching corals remains their protection and preservation, not yours.    So please look but don't touch.|`|6L0tVhn7aa	I love the whole 'they are fragile, they will die' if you touch them stuff. Corals are far more resilient than people give them credit for. I appreciate that large areas of coral reef have suffered recently from el nino events and over farming but a coral breaking is nothing to worry about, most staghorn style SPS fragments when broken will fall to the lower reef and reattach, grow and seed a new part of the reef (in fact most fragments in general). Corals have to be exceptional survivors because they are at constant war.....with themselves. A reef has prime real estate and coral species will sting each other to death to attain more space to grow and further the species. Not touching a reef is simply the point of staying away from an eco system that is quite happy without the interaction of man. As for touching corals, corals have an exceptional slime coat that will protect them from our bacteria unless they are ill/dying, you should be far far far more worried about the type of bacteria you are touching in that slime coat...i kid you not that a slight open wound on your skin touching a coral can result in serious health issues if your unlucky.
wlWzAL4yaa	Hi there,    At 5.5 weeks old lovebirds really only need feeding 2-3 times a day so you can start to cut back. If you are feeding 4 times a day cut back to 3 for a bit and then back to 2.    She is very close to weaning...lovebirds usually wean around 7-8 weeks, although I have had a few that although they are fully eating on their own they still beg for the spoon at night until 12 weeks. Comfort food :)  Now is the best time to be offering other foods such as fresh fruits and veg and pellets. She will play with it more than she eats it, but lovebirds are known for having fear of new foods so the earlier you get her used to what is good for her, the better.    If your baby is fluffing up when having a rest that is perfectly normal, but if she is fluffed up constantly it may be a sign of illness.    If she is sneezing during / after a feed it may be that she inhaled a small bit of formula into the trachea. When this happens sneezing or coughing can bring it back up again. If you are syringe feeding and a large amount of formula goes into the trachea you need vet help ASAP.    Occasional sneezing is also normal. It may be just something like tiny bits of shedded feather shafts getting "up the nose". Sneezing because of illness is usually accompanied by wetness - the feathers around the nose will become damp.    Check her feathers for mites. They are really tiny but you can see them if you part her feathers. They look like little black or red dots moving around. They cause serious itching problems for birds, but easily treated.    The best way to keep track of the health of a bird that is being hand raised is to weigh it daily (in the morning before the first feed). Rapid weight loss is a sure sign of illness. Just before weaning though birds to drop a few grams so that is normal. They need to shed a bit of that baby fat to be able to fly.    The chirping factor I wouldn't really worry about. The noise will come soon enough. Single bubs tend to be a lot quieter than several. I recently had to hand feed 9 baby lovebirds after storms damaged an aviary and they were all quiet until 1 would decide it was feed time and then they would all start screaming, but between feeds they were very quiet.    Once she starts to wean and discoveres she can fly she will start to put up a fuss to be let out of her cage.    She sounds pretty normal to me, but I can fully understand your concern. The first bird I ever handraised had me panicking at every twitch and sound.     If you are worried at any time a trip or call to your avian vet is the best way to go. You should organise a vet visit for a checkup soon anyway just to be sure she is in tip top shape.    Good luck!|`|ma6Re8B1aa	No I think that it will be fine. He's just scratching and sneezing. A lot of birds do this. I hope he survives!!! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Keep her out of drafts, and keep an eye on her. She is going to be itchy as her feathers come in, but don't let the air there get too dry-common problem in the winter. You may need to add some humidity to your bedroom.  Is she accepting the food OK? Is she growing? Does she respond to your presence? Hand feeding babies is always tough. There may be a reason why her mother rejected her. Keep doing what you have been doing.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	take the bird to the vet!!!|`|0Wn5EwaWaa	You said that she scratching herself you should check her for parasites and buy a cage protector. She shoud go to the vet for a check up as the guy you got her from sounds like he was not properly caring for his  animals. She is quite young to be given away. Are  you an experienced hand feeder? Many problems can occur from handfeeding mistakes.|`|bYPfFCr4aa	/\/\/|`|Zh1Y6lFIaa	Your baby lovebird sounds pretty normal for a baby. Some baby birds are more vocal than others, but I am sure she will come around once she is a bit older. You can also get talking courses to encourage speech from your bird. Here is more about that; http://jamiesparrothelp.wordpress.com/20...    Baby bird feathers don't always look the greatest, but she will start to develop her pretty feathers eventually when she comes into the fledging age and especially after she goes through her first molt.    Sounds like your lovebird is pretty darn cute and happy with you!

9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	Birds (wild) usually raptors circle around nests. I have seen for two reasons. One, their eggs are in the nest and they are trying to protect the nest. <br>  <br>  Second, there is a nest that belongs a prey (like snake eggs or small bird eggs) which they are trying to eat.<br>  <br>  A wild bird circling a person's head is to make sure that they will not get close to where the bird's nest it. It is just a form of protection and they are telling you that they are aware of you and that they are not afraid to attack to protect their area.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	I always thought they were targeting something to poop  on like a car or  your head LOL.

wfTCeGXQaa	One of my kittens couldn't meow because he was shy for about a year. She will start to meow soon, or if she doesn't, take her to your vet to see if she's deaf. She probably isn't, though. And sometimes, they can't meow at all. That is what happens to some cats that are rescued as orphans from outdoors. (my 2 cats were orphans when I rescued them from around my aunt's neighborhood)|`|naequcqlaa	I wonder IF by just calling a vet, they'd be "kind enuf" to give you some info over the phone w/o making you take her in.  IF she eats OK, doesn't do anything out of the "unusual" w/her eating habits, digestive tract, then I wouldn't worry.  Lots of cats are deaf, & they make out fine otherwise.  Is she by any chance a "white cat" in color?  For some reason, white cats are inclined to have hearing problems.  I've had MANY cats w/numerous situations, but never ran across this before.  I honestly wouldn't be overly concerned w/this matter tho...Take care, meow...:)|`|cb312f300707db2324933dd956aed7c4aa	I had a kitty that couldn't meow.  He'd try and try, but nothing would come out.  I asked my vet about it since I'd never had a cat that couldn't meow.  He said that there are some cats that just can't meow.  A lot that can't meow or only make a raspy sound can't do it because they may have had respiratory problems earlier in life that permanently affected their ability to meow.  It could also be because of some type of previous throat injury.  Or, if your cat came out of a home or shelter where she wasn't taken care of or kept healthy, it could be because of that and as she becomes healthier she may start meowing.  <br>  That's what the problem with mine was, he was very malnourished when I rescued him and he had respiratory problems.  It took a while to get him healthy again, but once he started getting better he started being able to meow. <br>  But if your kitty has never had any problems like that, she may just be one of those rare ones who just can't meow.|`|tyHYIpGEaa	Hopefully your cat should grow into it.

uWpwXn6paa	First off Guppy's are livebearers they don't lay eggs. I have never seen the adults eat the fry but I am sure they do eat some of them. Make sure they have plenty of cover--plants,etc.to hide in.They will multiply like rabbits if the conditions are right. Water temp should be around 80 deg F|`|AraBfesHaa	I have a 2 month old that just had her first batch of fry Sunday night.  That's the earliest I've seen that happen.  I didn't even know she was pregnant, she didn't show it at all.<br>  You male will most likely look like it's picking on the female when it's trying to breed with her, so it's they're old enough, it's probably already in the works.<br>  They WILL eat their fry until the fry have grown large enough to not fit into the adults mouths anymore, so if you want the fry, you'll have to put them in a separate tank.  Hiding spots will help if you leave them in the same tank, but most will still get eaten.<br>  If this is her first batch, she could have as few as 2 (my 2 month old had 16), but probably will have more.  Then evern 4 weeks or so she'll have more for up to 6 months without breeding again.  She can have up to 80+ at a time, so I hope you have plenty of tanks to house them in.<br>  And on top of that , in a couple of months all the fry will be mating too, if you don't separate the males and females soon enough.|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	I don't know the exact time, but guppies can start mating when they are sexually matured. That means you can see a gonopodium from a male and a gravid spot from a female. <br>  <a href="http://www.aquariumhobbyist.com/guppies/anatomy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumhobbyist.com/guppies/...</a><br>  If you keep the baby guppies in a tank with just guppies, they most likely won't be eaten. <br>  When a guppy is pregnant, the gravid spot will get darker and her belly will be bloated. <br>  <a href="http://www.dkimages.com/discover/previews/774/118422.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.dkimages.com/discover/preview...</a>|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	Well the guppies are usually approx 6 weeks before they can mate (I think).  The guppies will usually mate when they are in safe conditions.<br>  They eat some of their babies usually, and other fish will eat them too.<br>  Last I don't know if this is with guppies too, but some fish lay eggs in the little houses, some on the ground, and some, as weird as this sounds some keep the eggs in their mouth until their birth.<br>  Wish you the best of luck, and hope I helped.|`|lwfbhYDcaa	you can tell when they mate by them playing around with each other. u cant tell if theyre pregnat they jus lay eggs  at the bottom of the tank and no they do not eat their babies.
w1lh1INHaa	A six-toed cat is called polydactyl.  Another famous person was author Ernest Hemmingway.   The Hemmingway's Cats website has lots of pictures.

yQFdBj3haa	You shouldn't base your search on the breed you get lighter weights and medium weights in every breed. What do you plan on doing with the horse? Jumping? Hacking? Dressage? Once you know what you plan to do with the horse then you can search for that particular kind of horse. I mean you can get horses eg. Thoroughbred who are fantastic in jumping, dressage and basically any discipline but you can get thoroughbreds who don't do so well in jumping or dressage, etc. It's best to search for a horse that has the right personality and the right attitude for you and also a horse within your abilities. <br>  <br>  From what you've mentioned you'll probably need a taller horse because you are tall. I wouldn't go any smaller than 16hh. Most breeds will be fine for your weight and height it's just whatever you feel comfortable on really.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Quarter horses are usually thick built, but its more personally the horse itself, not the breed.  My paint mare is built like a thoroughbred.  One person came up to me and said "wow i would buy your horse for a million bucks- its the only pinto thoroughbred!" but no, she's about 1/6 tb, the rest is paint!  So, instead of judging based on breed, it should be height and build.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	ANY but the top breeds because they are calm and diligent and willing:<br>  <br>  Popular Breeds of Horses Around the World (Pictures too)<br>  American Paint Horse - Has an easy going temperament & used for cattle work.<br>  <br>  American Quarter Horse - Versatile, popular equine breed that's great for new riders.<br>  <br>  American Saddlebred Horse - Result of selective breeding of four breeds of horses.<br>  <br>  American Standardbred Horse - Most of this breed complete a mile race in 3 minutes.<br>  <br>  Appaloosa Horse - This horse's spotted coat and fur is its most recognize characteristic.<br>  <br>  Arabian Horse - Arabians are know for being affectionate and a dished head profile.<br>  <br>  Clydesdale Horses - Known for their large frames and study working abilities.<br>  <br>  Ponies - Distinctive pony breed (breeding two ponies) & is less than 14.2 hand high.<br>  <br>  Hanoverian Horse - This breed of horse excels in jumping, dressage, and eventing. <br>  <br>  Missouri Fox Trotter - Breed named after its unusual gait and smooth movement.<br>  <br>  Morgan Horse - Historically the official horse breed of the United States.<br>  <br>  Palomino Horse - Breed admired for their beauty, versatility, & endurance.<br>  <br>  Peruvian Paso / Paso Fino - Breed known for an easy ride on rocky terrain.<br>  <br>  Tennessee Walking Horse - Distinct breed with no trot - only a "running walk."<br>  <br>  Thoroughbred Horse - Horse of choice for racing and speed related equestrian sports. <br>  <br>  <br>  Pinto Horses - Their coloring provided a degree of natural camouflage.<br>  <br>  Mustang Horses - Mustangs can range in size of between 13 and 16 hands.<br>  <br>  it also depends on what disiplene you are doing; good luck :)|`|NYdxGC0naa	What would you like to do with it ?

Besides, you should NEVER focus just on breed. You need to focus on each horse as an individual.|`|jzKS5pxkaa	depends on what style of riding maybe a draft cross or some tall horse like 17.0 hands|`|psNR7hDJaa	What kind of riding do you do? <br>  <br>  For western: Quarter Horse, Paint, Appaloosa, Arabian, are some of them<br>  <br>  For english: Thoroughbred(don't get an ex-racer unless you are VERY experienced!!), Hanoverian, Trakehner, Arabian, some type of warmblood, Oldenburg. <br>  <br>  <br>  There are plenty of breeds out there. Go take a look. But don't just judge on breeds. You should look more into training and personality.|`|CBrsrL5vaa	It really depends on what kind of style riding you do and how much expirience you have.<br>  Here are horses I have had expirience with:<br>  <br>  Quater Horse:<br>  Good calm horse.  An all around horse and you can find them for good prices.  A good first horse.  Sweet and calm.  Very common horse.  Sweet good-tempered personality.  VERY curious and eager to learn new things and cooroperate.<br>  <br>  Appaloosa:<br>  Can be stuborn. Can be trained to do basically anything.  Sweet and very intelligent but spirited and can be hyper.  Uses: Barrel racing; western; trails; jumpers or hunters (but not as high).  Personality loaded.  VERY curious and like to get away with things.<br>  <br>  Thorough-bred:<br>  Not an ideal first horse.  Can have thier little moments either freak outs or just plain stuborn.  Can be hot tempered and fast or sweet as can be.  Have weaker joints in thier legs so better chance of them getting lame.  You would probaly need to get boots if you were jumping.  They have nice smooth gates. <br>  <br>  Halflinger:  <br>  <br>  Pony draft horse.  Pretty and cute.  Can be stubborn and VERY strong in the neck.  The ones I have ridden havent had much personality.  They are also good all around horses.<br>  <br>  Appendix (Quarter horse-thorough-bred cross)-<br>  <br>  The two I have ridden are both kind of spooky.  They are sweet and like treats.  Curious.  Get very strong bonds with a person.<br>  <br>  Here are little pointers on Gender:<br>  <br>  Mare-  Can be stubborn and they have thier moments.  In-season and usually more hot-tempered than geldings.  They seem to spook.  I do love mares and they are easy to bond with.<br>  <br>  Gelding-  A pretty good first horse.  Calm and gentle usually.  They dont really spook as much.  Calmer.  Do not go in season.<br>  <br>  This is the expieienve I have had with these horses so I hope this helps!|`|Bcda6zFBaa	the kind that you want, understand, and will fit your wants as a rider. nobody can tell you based on your height and weight.|`|6yvR1y6naa	Tennessee walker all the way that or a rocky mountain hehe im big on gaited horses|`|gqpZU2lJaa	QH|`|OH6AiGEfaa	gypsy vanner!!!
b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	you would be producing mutts thus adding to the already over populated dog world. No it will not mess up future breeding of the dogs however if you allowed you un fixed male to get our with other dogs and breed you should not be breeding him anyway as it sounds like you are not responsible enough to handle such a big responsibility.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Mess up?   Is the dog a pedigree, AKC registered dog?<br>  It doesn't do anything to the dog, but you end up with a littler of mutts for sure if you mix breeds.|`|AA12205365	Not really as there isn't a pitbull breed.  There are are number of dogs that are often grouped together as pit bulls.  The "American Pit Bull Terrier" would be an example of an AKC registered breed.  If both dogs don't have official paper work then the resulting puppies aren't pure bred. <br>  <br>    In any case I highly advise against breeding any "pit bull".  When I went to the shelter last year to adopt my current dog.  A large percentage of the dogs were "pit bull" or Pit bull + something.  Between them and the Chihuahua there are more than enough.  Anyone who would actually pay good money for a "pit bull" is crazy.  Walk down to any shelter and have your pick for what is basically the cost of their shots.  (Sure you can get free puppies, but it generally costs more in vet fees.)|`|AJxl0IvHaa	WHAT?<br>  <br>  - i believe you need some education.<br>  one i have no idea what you are asking two, get him or her fixed.<br>  Better life for the both of you!<br>  and if you have not noticed, people like you make people hate the pitt bull breed, and they are illegal to have in some states,and county..

ejj2N3uaaa	The fact that he's new may mean that he's just testing you. If that's the case, you just have to show him that he can't get away with his behavior. As soon as he takes off, reach down with one hand and pull him in that sharp circle. Use your legs to push his hindquarters the other way and disengage them. Be consistent. Don't wait for him to bolt--anytime you're cantering (or whatever) and he starts to speed up or get strong, turn him in a circle and disengage his hindquarters until he stops. Then ask for the canter again. Repeat. If you circle/disengage and eventually stop him (let him come to a stop on his own, forced by the circle/disengagement) every time he even thinks about getting strong or fast, he'll learn that it's easier to just canter at the right speed without pulling. If you aren't consistent, it won't work. <br>  <br>  Because he is off the track, you may have a long road ahead of you. He's been trained to run fast, not collect and go slow. He may not be trying to be bad, he's just trying to do what he knows. Again, the circling/disengagement will teach him to listen to you, but it may take awhile. My sister had an OTTB--great horse, but could get very fast/heavy. <br>  <br>  With that being said, you can certainly experiment with bits. I would not, however, just put a stronger bit on him and "fix" the problem. His behavior most likely needs to be addressed with the training/riding (using, for instance, the circling). However, experimenting with different types of bits--not necessarily harsh ones, but just different mouthpieces--might help because some horses do better in different bits. <br>  <br>  A good trainer and some lessons might help a lot. Bringing along a new horse--particularly one that's young and green, and even more so off the track--is difficult on your own. A good trainer can help ease your frustrations, speed the training process, and ensure that your horse gets a good start.|`|F1j74WMkaa	I have a similar problem when riding my dads horse, he can be fine one week, then the next week the bit has no effect, he is trying to see how far he can push you. <br>  <br>  Now i find that he is just easier to ride in a gag, this means i have to use less pressure and it just gives me those extra breaks, <br>  <br>  i would suggest that you continue to ride in the D ring snaffle for a while, if he continues to take off and you find it hard to get him back under control, try riding him in a gag.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Even the slow twist is a severe bit. The pain in his mouth and his racehorse training are combining to raise his fear level and make him run off. He needs to be taken by a professional horse trainer and carefully reschooled. OTTBs have special issues and needs and you should select a trainer with that experience. There are also books that can help you understand the nature of his past training.<br>  <br>  A well-trained horse can be ridden on a loose rein and stop just by opening your legs. This horse does not have, but badly needs that level of training. It does not take harsher bits to get this result - to the contrary. But it is a long, careful, step by step process to get this done, and you are probably not the person to do it.<br>  <br>  Select your trainer carefully. Don't just use someone close at hand. You need a trainer who has successful experience retraining OTTB and who will quietly and non-aggressively repair his training.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your horse.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	First of all Congratulations on your new horse he is a beautiful horse.  I agree with lop slow.  And I would say if he is getting worse and not improving I to would recommend lessons.  I would do Alto of give to the bit and practice gaining control of his whole body form his nose to his tail. Being able to turn on the hunches and for hand side pass and keep him soft and supple while doing it.  Those are some basic things he will need to learn and it sounds like he is pretty green and probably didn't learn those things. I to had one off the track who also loved to bolt forward (it was actually quite fun) hehe but with training and the exercises I recommended he ended up becoming a pretty neat horse.<br>  I wish you the Best with your new friend,<br>  Jenny|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	Changing to a stronger bit doesn't help solve the problem, it usually just makes things worse...|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Your sharp circle is called a one rein stop and that's the other way to get him to stop when he runs through your hands. The other way is to turn him into the wall.<br>  <br>  Have you tried a Mullen Mouth bit? I know a LOT of TBs with narrow mouths and every time you pull on the bit it jabs them in the roof of the mouth. If he's opening his mouth up or breaking at the poll he's being evasive so he doesn't have to listen to the bit at all.<br>  <br>  You don't need a more severe bit. Your horse is green and needs to be trained not to run through your hands. You do that by stopping him AS SOON as he doesn't listen to your SEAT to hand aid asking him to halt. Practice.
7fVr3q0kaa	It is definitely time to take kitty to the vet! Only a vet can detect the cause of the diarrhea.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, the biggest danger may be dehydration, which is really common among animals and humans with chronic diarrhea.<br>  <br>  To keep your kitty hydrated, buy some unflavored Pedialyte from your local grocery or drug store. Give her 1 tablespoon Pedialyte every hour using an oral syringe (no needle). If you don't have an oral syringe, repeatedly dip your finger in the Pedialyte and have her lick it off.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

nmercOm7aa	Yes he can get her pregnant, but mounting her may be hard for him. =) He cannot do it until she goes into heat, so you don't have to worry until then. Keeping them separate and using a doggie diaper can help. <br>  Some larger breeds can benefit form waiting to get spayed/neutered. I would get on some forums and do some research about it. I know there is a Newfie forum, I believe it is Newfnet. <br>  If she goes into heat before you can get her spayed, I believe you have to wait 3 months for it to be safe to do her. You can get he done before that, but the risk is higher and the cost can go up as well.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	The first heat for females is usually around 6 months old ( though some sooner and some later ).  If she goes into heat and is not fixed, yes, it is possible that your male can get her pregnant despite the size difference.  They can be spayed at or just before 6 months old, and it's usually cheaper then getting an adult done because of the size difference, check around your town for low cost spay and neuter clinics.|`|JsBb732Maa	You should be able to get her spayed now, your pom will try to breed her if she goes in heat, might not be able to but also could.

Most vets want to wait until the pup is at least 10 weeks or 4 pounds obviously she is both.  You might let her get used to her new home first.  But many shelters sapy and then adopt so she should be fine to have it done before you bring her home.  If you don't technically your pom can get her pregnant but usually she needs to be in heat before she can get pregnant.  I would do it sooner than later.  This web site explains why there is no reason to wait. <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypetcare.com/dogspayandneuter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypetcare.com/dogspay...</a><br>  Enjoy your new pup|`|KxjUim7yaa	Ask the vet to do it now before she comes into heat.

I'd get another Vet's opinion on getting your male neutered.|`|1K2EzfpEaa	My male pom was neutered at 5 mths and he was fine. It is better before they start going into heat to get it done early.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Yes, she could get pregnant. Talk to your vet. My dog was spayed at 6 months.|`|z8Zd8Mqyaa	My vet suggests waiting until about 7 months. So all of the sex organs can develop properly. I have a 3 month old male so, I am want to get him neutered asap. I am assuming Newfoundland so a rather large dog. <br>  <br>  I don't think a pom and newfiee would get together but strange things happen. I would get one of them fixed soon. There is a risk only if the pom or newfiee takes interest in each other. Keep your eyes on them. <br>  <br>  You don't want to give them the opportunity. Look into P.A.W.S to pay for the surgery.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Yes your Pom could get her pregnant if she was in heat. Chances are she hasn't come into heat though. Most dogs are spayed around 6 months of age. I'm sure she would be safe to come into your house at this point just keep an eye out for any signs of heat and get her spayed as soon as you can! :)
10AaMUfraa	Taking a steroid for that long can cause health problems and it gets where they don't work as well over time.  With out a necropsy you won't know.  Your normal vaccinations were not likely to have caused any problems.  My dog lasted 3-4 years on steroid shots before they had to be given more often from once every 2-3 months to nearly weekly before his respiration was labored.  Fluid builds up in the lungs and around the heart.  I too could only last for 2 days before I had to have him put down rather than watch him struggle to breath.  I am so sorry for you loss.  Grieve until it is at least a month before he crosses your mind before you try to replace him.  It takes time and the new puppy doesn't want to compete for your love of him and can't fill the void.  Make him the new love of your life after you old love has healed.|`|JsBb732Maa	I don't know but I am so sorry to hear about your dogs death. Think of all the good times you had when he was here and healthier. You gave him the best life he could have had. God bless you.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I am so sorry. I don't know about the shots. I wouldn't think so, but that was a lot to receive all at one time.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	I am so sorry for your loss! I know exactly how you feel, because my Chihuahua Gigi passed away this past August from Liver Disease. The only way you can find out for sure exactly what he died of, is to have a Necropsy (Like a Human Autopsy) done on your dog. That way you will know for sure!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I lost a dog to lymphosarcoma when he was age 10 and it advanced very quickly so that treatment was not possible and it was not as readily available 10 years ago when it happened.  It developed very shortly after he received his shots.  I now will be titring my dogs for immunity after the age of 7 before vaccinating (except for rabies which is the law).  I'm not sure about the heart condition - and in fact I sort of doubt it - but I do think there may be a link with over-vaccinating and cancer.  I firmly believe in vaccination and want my dogs protected but I also want to be reasonably cautious too.<br>  <br>  I too am sorry for your loss.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I am really sorry, I know how painful it is to lose your friend. As far as a reaction to his vaccinations, I doubt that. That would be something acute, (very shortly after having received them.) Just like with people sometimes, they take a turn for the worse and no one really knows why. Also, I was a vet tech for many years, I really don't think having his rabies done early would hurt him, so I hope you aren't blaming yourself. You took very good care of him and did all you could.|`|TczMCBGgaa	well both are really bad but I'm pretty sure that it may have been the addison's disease
TgNQAYyXaa	I think your best option is to you take your schnauzer to the vet.  And then take your cacti to a cactus specialist, otherwise both might be cactus.|`|KxjUim7yaa	A festering knot (abscess) should be looked at by the vet. Schnauzer may need antibiotics.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Ok, I'm assuming you mean, your dog ran into a cactus, you pulled most of it out and now there's a festering knot where the cacti was.  Yes?<br>  <br>  Take the dog to the vet.  Depending on the kind of cactus, there could still be spines left in the dog or worse yet, the hook parts of the spines.  If left in that knot will stay there and maybe grow and rupture and cause all kinds of infection.  Besides being painful for the dog.|`|z8Zd8Mqyaa	I would take him or her to a vet asap. Keep him comfortable by putting ice in a bag and then wrap a towel around the bag, then put it on the area for 10 minutes. Do that several times tonight, leaving it off for about 30 min each time. Hopefully, that will take some of the swelling down.|`|TczMCBGgaa	there may have been natural toxins from the cactus or it could be infected just take the dog to the vet, and have a sample of the cactus examined asap

tTLg4u9laa	GOOD FOR YOU!!!  I love you for wanting to have it done!!<br>  <br>  I suggest six months of age or whenever your vet says it is safe.  You just want to make sure your little puppy has "dropped his testes".|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The best person to ask is your vet.  Pretty much, once the pups testicles have dropped, he can be neutered, but some vets will make you wait till the pup is 4 months some will make you wait till they're 6 months.|`|yVlYuxPVaa	Well, it all depend on your vets decision. Some vets suggest 6 months, where as another vet might suggest 12 months. It all depends all your dogs health and fitness. So, I would talk to your vet about it.|`|peXKq1B6aa	5-6 months old. Most vets will tell you 6 months is the best time, but I got my Pomeranian neutered when he was a lil over 5 months old and he's fine :)|`|tPGxPDvBaa	6mo is a good time - before all the male hormones start kicking well.

lyhnHhuWaa	Ask your vet about getting Revolution.  It will kill mites if they exist, and will also serve as a long term flea preventative when applied monthly.  I've tried it and found the consistency to be a little different than the Advantage or Frontline.  It has a base that smells/seems more like alcohol than the oily consistency of the other two.  It seemed to dissipate more quickly and didn't leave the icky residue that the others do.  I stopped using it because my cats are indoor only and it was more than I really needed.  Given the extra cost, I decided to go back to Advantage.  But, the fact that it didn't leave gunk on their necks was nice.  Your long haired cat may tolerate this a little better, so I think it's at least worth a try.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Forget Frontline, ask your vet for a new all in one product called Revolution this takes care of fleas, earmites, and even worms. It doesn't matter if the cat doesn't have all of these it is also a preventative. This stuff works the best of anything on the market and you can get it at your vet without having to bring your cat in, saving money on an office visit. It costs about $12-$15|`|UF5ZwzHCaa	I would go back to the frontline.  My cats didn't like the feeling of the liquid on their skin either.  It is only once a month and it only takes a minute.  They will get over it.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	there are pills you can get from the vet for fleas.|`|GduRpnn0aa	Firstly, you should'nt use Frontline, Capstar or any of the other flea control products as they do contain chemical insecticides which can cause liver damage to both you and your cats. Did your vet notice any fleas on your long hair when you brought her in for possible ear mites? If not, then how did he come to the diagnosis of fleas?    It could be that by placing the Frontline on your cat, she may have developed a type of allergic reaction to it which resulted in her scratching so much and making it worse.    For flea control you can buy Feline Target Spray, which is a herbal insect repellant that is safe for use on cats. It has no side effects whatsoevever. http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-fleas-p6...    Common Symptoms of Flea Infestation on your cat:  Itchy skin   Red and inflamed lesions, especially in hairless areas   Presence of pus in the lesions   Flea dirt (dried blood that looks like black specks) can be seen on the pet's body and surrounding areas.     For ear mites you can use Ear Clear Drops, which is also a natural formula. The natural herbs found in Feline Ear Clear Drops help to fight viral infections, anxiety and depression. It also acts as a disinfectant.  Mites spend most of their life living inside your cats ear. Because outward signs are not always apparent, it is important to have your vet check your cats ears at each regular check up. If untreated, cat ear mites can cause cat ear infection because bacteria will have access to the ear tissue through holes made by the mites. Because the cat ear mites are irritating, many cats will scratch which can cause reinfestation through the paws or tail. Continued scratching can lead to bald patches where hair is torn out and even bleeding. At worst, the infection can spread to the brain, where it can even cause convulsions or death.

Gta9wO3taa	My used plexi glass 180 gallon tank cost that (not a lot of people want such large tank, so sometimes they are cheaper than smaller ones), so not the best deal. Start making your own 20 gallon its so much fun. I have a 24 gallon aquapod (just like nano cube) and its such a pain because you cant upgrade your filters or lighting. www.drsfostersmith.com check out their nano tanks. You can buy a nano cube for under $200 with stand if you really want. That is where I got my aquapod. The live rock sells for around $3-$5 so ten lbs would mean worst case $50. Youdon'tt need a heater either. My tank runs very hot even during the winter its about 79.Pulsee sand and a couple fish you are looking at $50. If youdidn'tt want to do the nano cube the cost of the nano cube $200 would equal a very nice sump andproteinn skimmer. So grand total around $300 to do it your self.|`|NCBDNMLXaa	That's a difficult question to answer, as your description lacks any details around the model of the lights, filter, heater, etc.  There are many different options with a huge range of prices.  You need to get the specifics and go online to see if their price looks fair.    Marine Depot is a good source for pricing on the hard goods.  The fish store should have a tank with live rock and prices posted....check out what they charge per pound and add that cost into your calculation.    Another thing to consider is that the cube is 30% smaller than your 20 gallon.  So, think about what you were planning to keep in your 20 gallon and plan on 1/3 less for the nano.  Are you ok with keeping fewer fish?    Remember too that the smaller the volume of water the quicker nutrients and contaminants will build up, particularly if the tank is overstocked...which is a tendency among small marine tank owners.  So again, be sure you're comfortable with the number of fish you can keep in the nano versus your 20 gallon before you make your decision.    As a final suggestion, I recommend Reef Central for anyone in the marine hobby.  While the bulk of the forums are intended for coral reef keepers, there is a "fish-only" forum and a "new to the hobby" forum.  It's free and I've gotten more good advice in there than you can imagine.    The water chemistry articles alone are worth your time.    www.reefcentral.com    Good luck.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	That sounds overpriced for a 14 gallon tank even with all of those extras.  I've seen a deluxe 55 gallon setup including the stand and hood for $449.  It didn't include the fish, but the fish you mentioned aren't that expensive.  14 gallons is a little small for a saltwater tank too, because many saltwater fish are large as adults.  Even clownfish can grow to six inches, so you probably wouldn't be able to keep more than two of them in a tank that size.
KxjUim7yaa	Don't feed before you go. Try the DAP spray. I use that for our dogs in the car. It is a calming pheromone like the mother dog gives off when nursing.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	My Aussie gets a little car sick when it's too warm in the car.  Try keeping a little cool in there.  <br>  <br>  Besides that ... I got nothing.|`|10AaMUfraa	Avoid food and water for 4 plus hours before travel.  Have short trips to get him use to the movement again and try giving him a peppermint to settle his stomach before travel.  If you notice that the movement is getting to him stop and let them walk it off for a little bit then try again.  Anxiety and fear lead to some of the problems of car sickness.  Try to reassure him that he's fine and if you have a travel friend for him to make him feed off the other dogs emotions much like a pack work together.  If the other dog is OK then there might not be XXXIX bothering your dog.  They share feelings of the stronger pack leader.  Sort of like when you're a kid it was easier to follow your big brother upstairs in the dark.  If he's not scared then why should I be and he's there to help protect you.  Gives self confidence that it will be OK.
gU34xa9vaa	I'm not going to say remove his claws or get rid of him,removing his claws is really removing his toes too and crippling him and I'm sure you won't want to do that.Anyway he would just bite you even more if you did that.  And why would I say get rid of him, you must have wanted him in the first place and you must love him as you play with him .....  I take it he is only young ? He will grow out of biting, but meanwhile you need to buy or make some kickable sized catnip toys,and when he goes to bite you, just distract him with one of them. Young cats get bored easily, they need lots to do.Has he a scratching post and as he doesn't go out, has he kitty grass and a window to look out of ? He isn't mental, he's just being  a cat, doing what cats do.You'd be worried if he sat there miserable and doing nothing,so just enjoy him !!|`|ivg0lRUraa	TASER! and if thats too extreme, theres stuff you can buy at pet shops that you can spray on that cats dont like and after a few times, they'll give up on biting you.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	smack him upside his head|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Whenever he bites or scratches, stop playing with him and completely ignore him for about 15 minutes. It worked with my newest cat. He would just get out of control when he was playing and couldn't settle down and my arms and hands looked just awful from all the marks so we started doing that. He is much much gentler now.  We just firmly tell him NO and ignore him for a bit, then he goes off and think about what he's done lol.|`|bj1fT8ctaa	Some cats might bite lightly when they're being affectionate.

I too experienced the same.  It's a playful act.  But painful to the owner.  I would shout ouch, ouch, ouch, loudly a few times and he would stop biting hard, and instead be very gentle with me. My bradley is now 8 months old and by golly he got IT!  I still may bite, I'll say Bradley BAD! and he knows, and he will LICK me instead...  He doesn't like it when I say Bradley Bad, Bradley Bite Mommy, he blinks his eyes, pull his head back, look at then lick me instead.  It does require patience.  Good luck!  Oh, removing his claws was never an option for me.  Oh, just between me and you, a little pop on top of the head works too, just a little tap though.

Its favorites are nuts, small seeds, berries and fruit. Most of these will be collected from the ground after they have fallen from the tree or bush. The chipmunk will climb a tree if necessary to obtain food, but this is not their preferred method. The Chipmunk will also eat Fungi, grass, and leaves at times.     The chipmunk is carnivorous. It will eat meat, such as slugs, snails, aphids and other insects. It has also been know to eat small birds, including their eggs, mice, and even small snakes.     The chipmunk will store food for the winter. It is very careful not store any fruit or meat that will go bad. These items are eaten immediately, while nuts and seeds are cache in one of its burrows.     Chipmunks are regular visitors to parks and campgrounds. They will accept a variety of foods from humans.

Whatever you prefere. <br>  and to show dominance whenever you take him for a walk make sure you're the one in front or if he tries bitting wrap you're hand around his snout and tell him no.<br>  <br>  <br>  For more advice or counseling email: goodnewsforpeoplewholovebadnews@live.com

GET YOUR DOG SPAYED.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD 2:  SHUT UP already.  We all know how IRRESPONSIBLE  you are.   I feel really SORRY for your dogs to have such an awful owner. Let them run around and get pregnant? Wow.  The reason you are getting "bashed" on is because you do NOT deserve to own any pets, esp dogs.|`|PM23RDycaa	Get BOTH dogs fixed. Two litters does not mix well IF you do not keep the separated. One or both moms will attack the other's litter to give HER pups the best chance of survival.<br>  <br>  You have no business breeding if you don't know what you are doing.<br>  <br>  It does not matter if this is her THIRD litter. EVERY pregnant dog needs prenatal care from a vet.<br>  <br>  ADD: You do realize that if you don't have one or both litters aborted you will have your hands full. A pregnant dog needs 24/7 supervision her last week of pregnancy and the first week to two weeks at least someone needs to be home with her and the puppies. Can you or your boyfriend afford to miss that much work?<br>  <br>  This isn't to be mean but it is the truth of the situation. Two litters are hard enough for people who do know what they are doing let alone for someone who doesn't.|`|v6L5axHgaa	The first answer is perfect!  You go girl, or guy! Haha!<br>  <br>  Anyways, now that u learned your lesson, u better get your dogs fixed.  ASAP.  I do believe that you are an irresponsible breeder and dog owner.  How can you let your dog out and get pregnant?  You are awful.  Just like the first answer, I REALLY DO FEEL BAD FOR YOUR DOGS BECAUSE THEY HAVE YOU AS THEIR OWNER.  They deserve a better owner.  <br>  <br>  <br>  :(|`|AA11341135	1.  Why are you breeding dogs if you don't know anything about this?  Just trying to make some quick money, at the expense of your dog's lives and health?  Shame on you.  Get your dogs spayed, and get a job instead.  <br>  <br>  2.  A dog will start panting and look for a place to give birth.  Oftentimes a vet is needed if there is trouble with the birth.  Again, you need to have your dogs spayed as soon as possible.  What you are doing is irresponsible.<br>  <br>  3.  If you are leaving a dog tied up in the yard, that is leaving her vulnerable to any danger that comes along - also completely irresponsible of you.  A dog should not be left tied up and helpless.  Leave your dogs safe inside the house, get them spayed, or find them some good homes because you are not providing that for them.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Hmmm. If you know that all these males are "running around" you should have had your female SPAYED!!!  <br>  You should get an ultrasound or x-ray to see how many pups to expect and if the vet thinks they may be to big to come out on their own.  If they are, she'll need a c-section.<br>  Why are all your dogs pregnant if you aren't a breeder?  Sounds fishy to me.<br>  <br>  If it's the other dogs 3rd time why are you asking for advice now?  Take both to the vet for xrays and be prepared to lose the mothers and pups because you are a ....._______________ (fill in the blank.
uBFhKXgHaa	It's nutritionally complete just like any other dog food on the market. However, it's also a low quality, expensive, /crap/. I'd recommend finding something better to feed your dogs.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot. <br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/</a> (RawFed)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawlearning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawlearning.com/</a> (Jane Anderson's Raw Learning Site)<br>  <a href="http://rawfeddogs.net/" rel="nofollow">http://rawfeddogs.net/</a> (Raw Fed Dogs)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawmeatybones.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawmeatybones.com/</a> (Raw Meaty Bones)<br>  <a href="http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html" rel="nofollow">http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html</a> (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs.

As well as Iams, Purina, Pedigree, Bil Jac, Beneful, Ol' Roy, ROYAL CANIN, Eukanuba and other low quality brands that contain by-products and fillers such as beet pulp, soy, corn, wheat and other cheap grains.<br>  <br>  I suggest you switch to a natura/holistic dog food.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturapet.com/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturapet.com/search/</a><br>  These are good.|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	It probably does as it is AAFCO certified, which means it is nutritionally complete.<br>  <br>  But Science Diet, Iams, Purina, Pedigree and all those have very low quality meat, some or even most of the meat can be from diseased flesh from animals which cannot be sold as meat for humans. It is always best to feed food that is "human-grade" quality if you want to make sure you have good healthy food for your beloved pet.<br>  <br>  You can check out dog food ratings here:<br>  www.dogfoodanalysis.com|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I think it's sub par dog food.

Go to dogfoodanalysis and pick a good food. I use Solid Gold Barking at the Moon when I am not making the food for my dog.|`|CRAklVJKaa	Do NOT give your animals Science Diet. It is detrimental to their health because the people who make it dont know  enough about animal nutrition. For example, their cat food includes too much fish, which is proven to cause hyperthyroidism.<br>  <br>  I suggest using a natural dog food. It includes everything nutrionally and it's in the right portion. I give my dogs, Nutro Natural Choice Ultra or Avoderm. My aunt uses Natures Balance with her dog.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	SD diet of any kind is a low quality food.I would look for something a lot better..no corn, wheat, soy or by products.<br>  <br>  Also unless your dog has a medical issue that means it needs to eat a lamb & rice diet do not feed lamb & rice.Lamb and rice is not meant to be fed long term to a dog unless there is a medical reason.<br>  <br>  ******just because a food is AAFCO doesn't mean it contains the proper nutrition or ingredients for dogs..all it means is that a dog can eat it and sustain life...that's it nothing more.So don't go by the fact a food is AAFCO to prove it is good for a dog nutrition wise.********

As long as it's not angelfish or other fish that consider neons food (oscars, etc.), coldwater, saltwater, etc.  Neons are really awesome and can live with pretty much anyone.<br>  <br>  A recommendation, try to keep the tankmates smaller, three inches at most.  Neons might get intimidated, and at bigger than three inches, the trend goes more towards pescavores.
NUIrBHXgaa	Neon tetras, hatchets, harlequin rasboras, and SAE, all will do okay each other. You could add shrimp and dwarf frogs, but it will be hard to make sure the frogs will get enough to eat since they eat very slow and will be with active fish that eat quickly.   <br>  <br>  I wouldn't add a newt mostly because i don't know much about keeping them with fish.  If you add a crayfish It will kill and eat the  fish in your tank.<br>  <br>  A Betta or Gourami would be fine, Don't get both tho  since they are similar fish with aggressive tendencies to there own kind(the betta especially) and will fight, most likely killing one of them.<br>  Also with the male betta you have to watch to make sure its long fins arnt being nipped by the other more active fish, in this case the rasboras would be the ones most likely to nip the betta.|`|A1iDPPOeaa	I always preferred a tank with fish normally found in the wild from the same geographical area, but to each their own...  You have a mix of South American, African and Asian fishes.|`|bZLi4Cr5aa	buy some cool fish instead of cheap ones :)|`|nZno3cMEaa	sounds fine to me
C1eHfhrHaa	Luckily ours do not, but it is a very common problem in the breed. Frist off, you need to inform the breeder.  Any reputable breeder has a guarantee against severe hip displaysia, and depending on the severity, you may be entitled to a replacement puppy or refund.  As far as pain management, many people manage their dog's pain through a vet that specializes in acupuncture.  We use one for another issue with our DDB, and it has worked wonders.  Good luck|`|FewhKlx9aa	This is way to young to tell if your pup had hip problems,this usually will not be known for 23mo's and then the breeder should offer a replacement..The fact tho that you get attached to your dog and that is the only gaurentee a replacement hat they know you won't do.I would make sure this is what is wrong,has your vet done x-rays?? As this still is to young to tell,the bones are still growing..

I have no idea what happened to him while we were gone but he did this for about a year and finally he doesnt do it as often anymore. I was very patient and when he would pee, I would calmly tell him "its ok, your ok "insert name here" and tried to calmly tell him that i wasnt going to hurt him and he wasnt bad, and then i let him outside (even if he had just been out there) and told him to go potty outside.
