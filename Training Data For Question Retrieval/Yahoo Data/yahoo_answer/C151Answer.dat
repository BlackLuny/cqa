They lasted for over 10 days and I thought it was my period coming, but it never came. Just a bit of old blood and then two days later a tad of bright fresh blood. My boobs hurt, I craved chicken burgers which I usually hate eating... if I ever went through that again, I'd know in a second I was pregnant.|`|Dhsyroekaa	i had sore sore sore breasts and was very tired.

When I first found out I was pregnant, I didn't have any symptoms at all. I think I was like 8 weeks along when the sore boobs, and "all" day sickness started. I was and still am very tired all of the time, certain things will just gross you out, your nose is super sensitive to all kinds of smells and have hot flashes from time to time. Everyone is different though. If the pregnancy test doesn't help, then really all you can do is wait for your period next month, if you don't want to go to the doctor.At least start on some vitamins just in case, so your baby is getting those good nutrients. The first 12 weeks are the most crucial! Good luck!|`|CQXGO1M5aa	Go to a drug store and buy a pregnancy test. Simple.|`|IkuZj0Lbaa	Pregnancy tests are getting more and more reliable.

Oh my gosh how rediculous is this!?|`|FIG58FVpaa	Absolutely not!|`|Xrvutzmdaa	what makes u think u know how to have sex ? AND NOOOOOOOOO  ITS NOT OKAY|`|PPqQ7yuDaa	Well you should tell her that the urge she is feeling is normal but I think it is a little early to feel that urge.  But even when you are 15 or 16 when that urge for sex is stronger you should not act on it. Sex may seem cool and it is what everyone is doing but what they don't tell you that it is OVERRATED!! at that age.  I would not say to wait till marriage because not everyone is the marrying type.  But you need be older and be able to accept the responsibilities that will come with having sex ( a child, AIDS, STDS)  She also needs to know all the facts about sex like different methods of birth control and all of the diseases.  Make sure she sees pictures so she can see that even if you are protected with a condom you can still catch something.  If you tell her this now maybe the sex urge will not be as strong.  But good luck I hope she listens.|`|VUfT35UQaa	It is illegal, immoral, and she will SO regret it later, at age 10, you havn't even gone through puberty!

E5CnUdhsaa	i gave my daughter formula in and an oz of water at meal times but thats optional. i gave it at meal times because the other times shed be having her bottle. i took away the bottle at 12 months as she was drinking more than enough milk out of her sippy. i would let the sippy be more of a beverage and the bottles and solids be the main source at that age but theres no harm whatsever in encourage the use of a sippy cup, sooner the better IMO:)|`|r5R2nstRaa	i wouldnt recomend to put anything in the sippy cup except juice. if you child still has formual keep that in a bottle. once your child get of cows milk, then you can take the bottle away.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Sarah started to finally take the sippy cup at 11 months, she is 2 weeks shy of a year.   I put formula in the sippy cup as well as juice & water...babies can start having no more then 4 oz of juice or water around 6 months if you like. Don't have to but can.  I give her a cup at her meal times, in between, water and juice is always available to her when she want a drink.   I still give a bottle at night before bed..I just recently stopped the morning bottle 2 days ago..she doesn't miss it at all.   But we actually started the sippy cup around 7 months, and she just wanted to play with it..you can introduce it, let him check it out..do this a few times, he may not grasp the concept, until much older. But its ok , no need to really rush it.   It took us to try 3 different cups until we found one she really likes alot. Munchkin Brand..tall like a bottle and soft spout.|`|ztug2gLjaa	I never put formula in there sippy cup only water and juice.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	My son is 8 months and I use the sippy between meals to give additional water/ very diluted juice. They do need a little extra water once they are on solids (he only takes an ounce or 2 a day). Once he is closer to a year, you will start switching his milk feeds into a cup instead of a bottle.|`|k4SlMtYHaa	I would first try several types of sippy cups.  My son only like one type out of the several that are out there.  You can introduce a 4 oz of liquid or less, 1/2 water, 1/2 juice mixture in the sippy cup.  For me I did this after a meal.  This may make it more palatable and for my son more eager to drink out it.  Once the baby turns a year, you can put regular milk in it.  I would not put formula in it.  I took the bottle from my son by the time he was 18 months old. I did it slowly by eliminating the day time bottles and then eliminating the morning and lastly the night. At night time, my son (now 23 months old) gets a sippy cup of milk a half an hour before bed and then he takes a sippy cup of water to bed (just make sure the lid is on) so the ritual is the same, without fear of bottle rot.|`|hVVALFAPaa	I started mine on a sippy cup much younger-- though I did not put more than a teaspoon in it. I let them explore it and play with it so it was not something new and unexpected. I gave it to them whenever they ate solid foods.    I started with formula, or you can try some diluted pear or white grape juice. It will always be just a beverage so don't worry about how much he takes in. Like bottles, some babies have a preference for different types of sippy cups. You may have to try several different brands before he decides which kind he likes.    At maybe 10 months or so, when he starts to get most of his nutrition from solids as opposed to formula, I started replacing one bottle per week with a cup.    All of mine were completely off the bottle at 12 or 13 months old.|`|f0ZXgvP6aa	My doctor ok'd water, like an ounce or two a day once he started cereal so I used the Gerber Sip and Smile sippy cup. This one had the softest spout (it's shaped so that it's tilted a little too) but it is hard to suck out of with the valve in it. So at mealtimes I would take out the valve and give him little sips so that he could learn what it was for. He didn't really start sucking out the water on his own until close to ten months and then I put the valve in and now he's good to go with it. Most wean from the bottle at about a year and if he's on the sippy really well it should be fairly easy to just replace formula bottles with cow's milk from the cup. Good Luck!!|`|pXSKSS3daa	I didn't put my son's formula feedings into his sippy cups until this past week(he's off bottles now) and he'll be 10 months old tomorrow.     Before then he practiced with it with water and diluted juice(never more than 3-4 oz. of each at a time). At only 7 and a half months I wouldn't worry about replacing any bottles with sippy cups just yet. Give it to your son with a couple oz. of water in it and let him practice.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You *can* give water when baby is over 6 months even though they don't need it, some formula fed babies do need a bit of extra water when high protein foods are added to their diet.  You should limit it to less than 4oz per day for a breastfed baby and 8oz is the general rule for formula fed babies.    You can also give formula in the sippy cup.  However avoid letting your child formula or cow's milk when they aren't going to finish it reasonably fast because a) constantly sipping sugar is bad for teeth and b) bacterial growth.    There is no rush to give up a bottle, like thumbs, pacifiers, and teeth grinding most babies will stop before their permanent teeth erupt, and usually before 3-4 years.  Also many of those children that do not give up these behaviours are the ones that were constantly pressured to do so.    Try to get the bedtime bottle slightly removed from actual going to sleep.  Try to institute bottle, brush teeth, book, then bed.  Or at least bottle, teeth, then bed.  However if, like my first, your kid has severe tooth brushing aversion then try to get the baby to let you wipe out their mouth quickly with wet gauze, or drink an oz of water after the formula.      Don't let the baby fall asleep drinking the formula if at all possible.  However in the grand scheme of things baby teeth fall out, abusing your child out of stress from trying to force them  give up bottles at night lasts a life time.
r7q8LW7Aaa	I waited until mine decided she didn't like it anymore, which was somewhere around 6 months. I know they say that you don't need it then, but if he likes it, keep it going till he decides otherwise. Just be careful he doesn't topple over in it - he's bound to be a strong boy now!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Check the weight restrictions on the chair...but so long as that is ok you should stop as soon as he can sit up, if throws himself forward to sit up he could tip the chair.  If you are sat with him for a while though he'd probably be ok...but if he is nearly sitting up unaided maybe best to take him out of it if you need to leave the room :)|`|5a0aa52154dbae13070c1a1ec35baccbaa	My Boy was about 10mths but it varies with different Children some like it to Bounce frantically and others just to rest...As others have said you not doing nowt wrong alls good ...You will know by instinct on when he will stop...Good-luck!!! blimey mines 9 this year time flies...Thanks for the question.... :)|`|r5R2nstRaa	i waited till my son didnt like it any more. seems like your son is loving it! dont take it yet, he's having fun. he'll let go when he's ready.|`|A89ezcg5aa	My baby turned 1 in December, and I stopped using it then because her's is for up to 25 pounds.      (All chairs have a weight restriction.  Stop using it when your baby is the maximum weight, can tip it over, and/or whenever he starts to hate it.)|`|qIHTmouhaa	My son never really did like his bouncy chair but the last time I believe he used it was about 5 mths. We put him in it and he just bawled to get back out. As long as he still loves it I wouldn't worry about putting it away just yet. At least it's giving him some entertainment.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	My daughter never really liked it.  Once she was aware enough to know she was in it (around 2 months or so) she refused to be in it.  I just started using a sling instead.    Wish I would have never bought the stupid thing....|`|tTf1Zp5eaa	Hi,  I stopped at around 6 months because my son could sit unaided by then.  The day I stopped was when he was sat in his bouncy chair in the kitchen while I was doing the washing up. I suddenly heard a thud and then looked down and he was lying facedown with the chair on top of him. All I could see was his little hands poking out the sides shaking! I screamed lol! but he wasn't hurt, in fact he only cried because I scared him with my scream! Anyway I never put him in it after that! :)|`|4WNeBRjVaa	I don't have any children.

So congratulations!|`|VY4LqfLpaa	our son is almost 7 1/2 months old.  We are still using his, but looking for something new since he's starting to try to sit up in it on occasion.

I would wait until he can climb out of it or he is too heavy (around 20lbs)|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Um, I believe Rylie was about 6months, when she could sit unaided we stopped using it. The guidelines say once they ca sit unaided to stop using it, but thats probably just there for people who will leave their child unaided and the end up toppling over. I would say keep using it whilst his is happy and like you said you always supervise him in it anyway! :o)

That must be the reason you want all "C" names so you don't have to think; you can just lump them all together under the heading of "the triplets". That way, no one else has to make the effort to get to know them individually either.    Please remember, eventually they'll all go their separate ways but will be far less prepared for life's problems because you deprived them of learning to be independent beings.    Kinda' selfish, don't ya' think?|`|GvamTVqAaa	I like Carsyn for a girl, but Carson for a boy is nice as well.|`|TffCSzHxaa	I like Chloe, Chace, and Caleb.  Here are some middle name suggestions:  Chloe Marie  Chace Matthew  Caleb Mark    Chloe Grace  Chace Gabriel  Caleb Gavin    Chloe Caroline  Chace Corbin  Caleb Cashton|`|GZRHJBT7aa	I like Cadence, and Caleb & Corbin.  I think Cadey would be a nice middle name for Cadence also.    How about these ..  Cadence Bailey  Caleb Brady  Corbin Brody    Then you'll have one son with the innitials BC and everyone else with CB innitials. I think that's cool.|`|nkM6wmv6aa	please don't do the matching initials!!|`|xLabGD6Maa	I like Caroline, Christine, and Craig.|`|2InNn09eaa	i love corina! but  people might endd up calling her corey.. so make sure ur ok with that!  i like cash but not cashton  i like chace|`|70TOo3vtaa	Girls Names:   Clara,  Chloe (as you said),   Clare,   Clarise (Clarees),   Cara,   Carrie,   Charlie,   Charlotte,   Carys,   Clarett    Boys names:   Clark,   Cleo,   Chance (as you said),  Calum,    Connor|`|x4dXLF8Raa	omggg ur so lucky!! ur having triplets!    i like    boy names:  caleb  carlos  cameron  cesar  clayton  carey    i hope this helped :)    girl names:  Cailey    Camil [cami a nickname]  Carla  Caroline    cassandra  cassey  cherie  cybil  cristal|`|Fb0vbaRuaa	I really really like Chloe and Cadence, but  I'm not that fond of Carmen or Corina.   How about Celeste or Cecile?   As for the boys, Caleb reminds me of   "Desperate Housewives", very creepy, Chace is   cool (the cute Australian from "House MD"?),   and I also like Cayne. Carey is a bit feminine,   Corbin sounds like corps and please don't name  your child Cash. Perhaps Carlston or Caldon or  something like that (not that these are something  very special or pretty...).  Hope some of it is useful.|`|CpUn8MZeaa	Love the Cash thing Love corbin I also like Caden    I love cadence but don't really like the rest   you could also use caden for a girl|`|tlUqwZ74aa	i like chloe, chace, and caleb. all of them are good choices though ;)|`|xLmtXZJ0aa	I like: Casey and Candace for girls and   Caleb and Chace for boys    good luck!|`|zIrtLAoSaa	Not a fan of the "matchy" multiples names...

jaAolejUaa	as long as he's breathing u dont have to worry.. :)|`|dDDAbqqhaa	No that's completely normal|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Everytime that my babies would go through growth spurts they would sleep a lot!!! I wouldn't worry too much unless he is not wanting to eat or running a fever. It does just sound like a growth spurt to me though.|`|nukcYkR9aa	talk to your doctor! all babies are different in terms of their schedules.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	You should be glad you didn't wake him or you would have been real sorry, don't ever do that!  Yes it's normal and you can worry all you want and it will have no difference on the outcome, so why put yourself through it?  It will be normal for his schedule to change, then change again and again for no apparent reason, so be prepared!  Usually when you wake a sleeping baby, they cry for hours!|`|A89ezcg5aa	He's probably ok. Sometimes babies just sleep more days than their usualy schedule. Check his temp, check his limbs for poor muscle tone, his breathing, and then just call the nurse, because he/she be able to better assure and comfort you better than someone who isn't a medical pro.  Never feel stupid when calling the doctor.  I have 2 toddlers, and I call at least 2-3 times per month with questions...|`|HbmHRiwLaa	babies at that age ALWAYS sleep that much... don't worry.. as long as your gettting wet/poopy diapers and he is eating enough he's fine! :)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFFYIdslQ...|`|MczmTftTaa	No, unless you suspect he has a drinking/drugging problem.|`|pPhy6JVDaa	I'd get some sleep if I were you because he's gonna be up all night!!!    Enjoy this time because he won't sleep that much for long!!|`|aSjdL4heaa	Check and make sure he doesn't have a fever.  Infants will start to sleep more when they are ill.|`|rNdun1V7aa	my son is 3 now but i do remember days like that and everyone always told me they have lazy days just like us, and yea he probably is growing. never hurts to be cautious! and yep we all worry :)|`|5DJcir9saa	Maybe just a growth spurt.  If he is at least getting up to eat, then there is probably nothing to worry about.  If his appetite seems to go down, then I would call the pediatrician or if he continues to sleep this much for more than a couple days.|`|qIHTmouhaa	It may be a growth spurt like you said. He could also be teething.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	as long as he is not limp when he is awake he should be fine...he could be going through a growth spurt in which they sleep alot...I would say if he is still so sleepy tomorrow just give your DR a call to check with him...cause he is only 7 weeks old..you don't want it to be something serious...like dehydration...|`|AA10033254	i remember having days like that with all my kids(i have 5). Don't worry and take advantage and have a nap if you need one.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	He's probably going through a growth spurt.  They go through phases where they sleep a lot more than usual.  Don't worry about it, enjoy it while you can.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	Hes jus tired give him a few weeks you will be begging him to go to sleep during the say.|`|cYHoQomVaa	they have a growth spurt about this age. every couple of weeks they will have one. i was warned about that by a nurse that came for a home visit, in ohio the state provides that for all first time moms. ask your ped. if they can provide approx. growth spurt times for you.|`|hxGmAvJjaa	no. perfectly normal. maybe he is starting to get new teeth, or he is just worn out. growth spurt would definitaley be the answer if he starts getting more hair, or get taller! when he is awake try to keep him up as long as possible.|`|hVVALFAPaa	If he is still waking long enough to eat, then it is a growth spurt. Babies usually have them at about 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months.   Enjoy it while it is happening! It won't last long!|`|DIZKlxNraa	No!! You should consider yourself lucky!!|`|k4SlMtYHaa	Talk to you doctor if your baby seems sickly or is running a fever or something just doesn't add up.  Otherwise, there are times when the baby will sleep and eat and do nothing else.  Often he is having a growth spurt and next week may be completely awake.  Also around this time babies do begin to sleep through the night and may still need a lot of day time sleep about 16 to 17 hours as day.  I wouldn't worry.
hrEQXFdYaa	4 months is a long time, and youve had periods for four months, so its most likely the craziness thinking, i know how it feels. its really easy to detect and overanalyze normal everyday feelings (bloating) when something like this has consumed your thinking.|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	You are probably not pregnant. The test would pick up the HCG hormone by 4 months along. People get bloated for a number of reasons, for example, their body could be holding too many fluids. You will stop thinking you are pregnant as soon as you find a way to convince yourself you are not. Go to the doctor and have them test, that should put your mind at rest.|`|Dhsyroekaa	your not pregnant, dont worry. You probably had food poisioning or something. Relax :)|`|59SM8kFIaa	om you should call the doc!! asp  you should be having at 4 months if you wear pg  the hcg would be high enough   to come upon a test!!! just call your doc plz|`|3qI1oyFaaa	If you were 4 months along a pregnancy test would definitely be positive. Also, you would be having many more symptoms other than throwing up a time or two and being bloated. There is much more to being pregnant that a 'feeling'.|`|0EdCuOYjaa	Could be food poisoning as some forms of food poisoning can take up to two or three days before you get symptoms.    Also though, it could be an ectopic pregnancy which could result in the HPT showing up negative.     Best see a doctor to make sure|`|yWi0gWiBaa	go to the doc and get a test done there just to make sure
AA12181093	When my son was that age, he had a stuffed Blues Clue dog that went almost everywhere with him.  I drew the line at going into the tub so Blue would sit on the sink or the toilet tank while he had his bath. He also had smaller stuffed animals from the then popular Bear In the Big Blue House that were toted all over the house.  Sometimes, he'd take all 5 with us when we went somewhere.  I had to replace Blue twice with new ones before he grew out of that phase.  I replaced them while he was sleeping & never knew the difference, thank goodness.      It's a security phase that most kids go through & relax, Mom, about it.  Wash the blanket when he's sleeping if you can get it away from him.  If not, offer him another one temporarily so you can wash his favorite blanket.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My daughter Sophie is 4 and she loves her red and pink blanket named "blany" she has had it since she was 5 months. My son Liam he is 2 he has a teddy bear named Berry.|`|IE5vmmQEaa	My son is 2 years old and he loves my blanket whenever he goes to sleep he won't sleep unless he has mommies blankie..ihe flips if he doesn't get it..so I know how u feel =)|`|V8wUAVdyaa	Maybe you could cut it slowly while he isn't looking or sleeping??.. not enough to notice.  Eventually it will be small enough to where it wont be a  nuisance and he will be able to put it in his pocket or something.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Most babies latch onto something. I never had trouble though. Don't know what you mean by that. We just let them have what they wanted to carry around. It's easy to launder these things when they are sleeping. Our baby girl carried around a big plastic cow that you could actually milk. It was over a foot long and heavy as rocks. She brought it to church every Sunday and when she sat that cow on the wooden pew, people knew she was there!|`|AA11981363	I have a 2 year old daughter (24 mo) she has this blanket that she carries everywhere, it drives me nuts, she sucks on it too, and loves it when she is upset. If she asks for it and we don't give it to her we will witness the end of the world LOL. I found a smaller version of it, and has like a puppy attached to it, so I let her carry that when we are out and about. At home, she looks like a female copy of Linus (Peanuts) dragging it all around. I have to wash that thing several times a week!|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My kids are going to be 3 years old and 2 years old in 3 months.  Neither one of them has ever attached to a blanket or animal. The older is a boy and the younger is a girl.  My daughter loves stuffed animals, dolls, and blankets, but she just loves them all!  But she plays with them, though never HAS to have one to be happy or comforted.  My son uses blankets to sleep and that is it.  He hates stuffed animals, and gave all of the ones he had as a baby to his sister.  All except one, Rudy.  Rudy is a big stuffed Husky (Melissa and Doug brand, thing is at least 2 feet tall and 4 feet long).  He lives on our couch and my son carries him around sometimes when he is playing.|`|tBqVnItZaa	A sponge bob doll  lol she love that thing more than me too|`|Y0p1LDTDaa	no i used to love my "blankie" and would cry if my mother even tried to wash it, but by the time i went to kindergarten i still loved it but i didn't take it with me everywhere, i realized that none of my friends had balankies so i ditched mine. kids its just a phase he will grow out of|`|zRIDQraFaa	The more you try to take it away the more he will want it.     For now when he see's the blanket he will associate the image of the blanket with the feeling of comfort. As he gets older and more thoughts and feelings enter his mind he should expand to other things and leave that behind.|`|ztug2gLjaa	my daughters baby doll and stroller.  If she doesn;'t have that then yuo better watch out.  I think she loves it more than I do and I bought that for her...LOL|`|dxTwHB1yaa	My two year old has a stuffed moose that he's had since his first Christmas. His name for it is "Foof" and God forbid he goes one day (or one nap) without it.     I have to wash it at least every other day, because when he's feeling shy or bored he chews on the tag and it gets very gross very quickly.|`|AA11755924	my daughter has a stuffed duck she calls, "Quack Quack".  It's been in her crib since she was born and she just got attached to it.  She won't go to sleep without it.  Once she left it at the babysitter's place and we had HELL trying to get her to sleep that night.  We ended up having to drive all the way across town to get Quack Quack back....uhhh|`|5f2e5da7d48269806f35d9ae5290b898aa	My toddler has her own small baby blanket, small heart shaped pillow, and a stuffed tiger. She has to have all these things when she goes to sleep. God forbid if we ever lose any of these things. We would be in big trouble!!|`|sciO32Bsaa	It's perfectly normal in fact research shows it's NOT good for a child to take away their security item.|`|AA11431474	It's normal and sometimes helpful for a child to have a comfort item. My son had a blanket he had to have when going to sleep or upset, and he liked to know it was around in case of emergencies.I kept in in his diaper bag, and it was helpful for the baby sitter, church nursery, grandma's house, or other situations where he got a little upset and needed comforting.  I never tried to take it away from him, but did convince him to throw it into the washer himself so it could get all nice and clean and fresh smelling. He was ok as long as it was his decision to throw it in, and I did it when he was busy playing anyway or asleep. He eventually outgrew it for daytime use, and liked to keep it on the bed in preschool and kindergarten maybe, but stopped using it. He agreed to just keeping it in his dresser, and I saved it for his box of memorable baby items. It actually came in handy while traveling, as he would make a sling out of it and put his toys in it and carry them around, since the agreement was that if he brought something along he had to carry it himself. Now that he's a teenager I think he's kind of attached to a soft fleece blanket he uses now.  I've seen him snuggling up with it when going to sleep at home, but not in a disturbing way. But he's also been an easy sleeper, who loves snuggling up with his blanket and feeling safe and snug in his bed, ever since he was a baby.
E6T9DPT9aa	You can't fcuking spell pregnant. You are 14. You both have NO common sense. Get some fcuking sex education! The "pull-out method" DOESN'T WORK! EVER!    You wasn't "making love" either, he just wanted sex! You don't know what love is!    He's probably going to leave you if you are pregnant. Unlucky.

Just because you are "together" or "making love" is no excuse for not using a condom.  Think about the long term consequences.|`|xcF30urOaa	Im sorry to say it but you don't sound mature enough to have a baby .  I used a condom every time but it broke . I think it was gods plan .  Although I wasn't having sex at Fourteen and I could also spell properly .  You're parents might very angry with you .Luckily my parent we're only mad for about  a week because they know that I am responsible enough .I never ever recommend an abortion   so if you're pregnant I would get an adoption even though Im not ever going to do that but Im a little older than you are.  Fourteen year olds can't get a job , I can barley get one ! Your boyfriend if he loved you , would have used a condom      Im not trying to sound mean at all though If you think you're up for having a baby email .I don't mean to judge you or anything !

A lot of times, it works.|`|rE9J1DqTaa	Your boyfriend just wanted sex. Number 1 your to young.  Number 2 your probably going to pregnant soon.

Oh and learn how to spell pregnant.|`|KlDoKDEjaa	ok you need to take a test if you are DO NOT HAVE AN OBORTION and next time you have to use a condom or even take the mornig after pill but take the test and if you are congrats hope you have a great kid|`|3LEPfzVhaa	You sound very naive to be having sex.  One, you have exposed yourself to pregnancy, STI's, two, your boyfriend has pressured you into doing something that was not sensible at all, three, the pull out "method" will not work. Take a pregnancy test. I'm not sure when to take one, but pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the womans last period if this helps. Might not, but an interesting factoid anyway.|`|hGY08GjRaa	There's a chance,  but maybe you'll "luck out"  Find out how soon you can take the over-the-counter test. If it's positive, your life will change. IF it's negative, take the following advice...    DUmp that boyfriend.. any guy who doesn't use a condom EVERY time is just a moron.. sorry.. It's horribly irresponsible of him, and horribly irresponsible of you to consent to it.     It's okay because you'll be "making love"??? What the he**?? How ELSE does he think babies are made? He thinks only people who aren't in love get pregnant? What? He's a loser, sorry.. BOTH of you need to smarten up.  Can you be 100% positive he's NEVER been with someone else? I've known LOTS of guys who lie about that. If he has, you have STD's to worry about too.. You're essentially "sleeping with" everyone he's slept with, and everyone THEY'VE slept with.     USE CONDOMS    The pull out method (even if he pulls out ALL the way) does NOT work.. People who use the pull-out method are called PARENTS.     IF you want to have sex, get on the pill, and make him use a condom (spermicidal) EVERY time. Or you WILL end up pregnant.     Please smarten up...|`|cmEi3CVqaa	always wear a condom, so what if u are together and making love, that doesn't stop pregnancy :S next time get him to wear one or tell him no sex. take a pregnancy test. if positive go frm there and decide what u wanna do. ur parents dnt have to know but i wud tell them or an adult that u trust, a cousin or sibling maybe?|`|fTvVEMVtaa	oh jeeze, ur so young.  most guys says they love u so they can have sex with u...don't u know that?
1hpctY4saa	The closer you get to your normal first day of your cycle... the more accurate the readings (to my knowledge).  My wife ovulated around mid-January...and she took the test last Thursday...and it says she is pregnant!    If you are involved in basal body temperature charting... that can also be an indicator.  My wife's body temperature stayed higher than normal for more than 18 days...and then she took the test which confirmed it.  I wasn't sold that the basal body temperature was reliable... but apparently it meant something.    I wish the best of luck to you!|`|L982MxUvaa	I ovulated on 11-7th or 8th of 08 and tested on 11-19-08 and got my BFP.. very faint lines though.  It may be a lil to soon, but I wish u the best of luck!!|`|GcJszsMnaa	You might get a neg...if you test right now.. so wait a few weeks just in case..Good luck hun!!|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	At 8 dpo it would be too early for any pregnancy test to give you an accurate answer. Implantation can take up to 14 days, so you may not even be pregnant yet, since you are not pregnant until after implantation occurs and no hcg hormone is produced until a couple of days after that happens, so no BFP.    You can start testing after you miss your period. Anything prior to that, and you can get false negatives (being pregnant but getting a negative test) or false positives (chemical pregnancy). Good luck.|`|SBJNJEBBaa	I wouldnt test now, but i also wouldnt wait a couple weeks! normally they tell you that you can test 10 days after conception, but i would wait alittle longer, i would wait until you miss your period|`|S1gJJHNzaa	you can start at 10dpo with a first response early results and first morning urine (be sure it says early not rapid) but there is a good chance it will be negative even if you are pregnant..    best bet (and I can't hold out myself) is wait until 14dpo and test with a first response early results (frer) and first morning urine (fmu).    good luck and God bless!
Oc4AWcqoaa	You can easily check your minimal health insurance rates in internet, for example here - healthplans.my-age.net|`|bO2rzfISaa	There's a standard amount, but what if something goes wrong? You could be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, just starting out. If her parent's insurance will cover her pregnancy (it may not; you should have her call and ask) she should stay on it. However, it would be smart of you to buy her a nice ring.|`|H82TNFlgaa	Without insurance upwards of $10,000, if you can get subsidized. However, I needed a C section and just the anesthetic cost $2000 (OMG!!). I know people who are paying off $15,000 plus.    I would advise her to get insurance or if she is already pregnant and won't be able to get covered due the pre-existing conditions clause, try contacting insurance companies as they have a few slots (that they don't advertise) for that. We went through MRMIP. It cost us $2,000 in insurance payments, but they covered the rest.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	It depends on how much money you make?   I think its around $10,000 including the prenatal visits if you're forced to pay on your own AND there aren't any health problems (I just saw my sisters insurance statement-she had baby last month). If she had to have a C section or something it would be more, and there are lots of other health issues pregnant women get.    Usually if the woman/family has a low income though she (and the baby once born) are eligible for Medicaid which pays almost all the bills. Also some states have free/low cost family insurance plans for people who make more than Medicaid allows. You should look into those, or get a job that offers insurance very quickly? If you can't get her insured in any way I personally might wait for marriage until after the baby is born and you have an insurance plan that will cover them. There are so many possible ways to run that bill up to an enormous amount, you don't want to start out with big debts/stress/possible poor medical care.|`|Gem96NQyaa	It can be as high as $10,000 to $15,000 or more... and that's assuming nothing goes wrong (complications during pregnancy, premature delivery, the need for a c-section, etc.).    Do NOT let her drop her father's insurance until after the baby is born.  Babies are expensive enough as it is.  You really don't want to add hospital costs on top of it all.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I am a single first time Mom of a 10 month old and my child father makes very good money, but because we didn't live together I was eligible for medicaid. And thank God according to some friends of mine who had to get loans for over $12,000 just to have their child not to mention any after care or what it my have cost had they had any problems. As for my out of pocket expenses - $00. I would seriously have your girlfriend look into Medicaid. I'm pretty sure it varies state to state but its well worth it to give it a shot. Plus, she may be eligible for other forms of assistance that will help to feed and diaper your unborn peanut. Good Luck!|`|SR0hYSqGaa	I'm so glad I live in the UK - its all free free free.....

Be sure to be there for them.|`|7qAlZRHmaa	IF you are 18 you can get custady for them i would try or get a lawyer and disscuss that with them show them pictures of you and the kids ask the kids who they want to be with they probley only want to be with there mom becuz they can do what ever they want... Make sure if you are over 18 to have a job be out of school and stuff like that if you would like to email me back that is fine
aJTBF7opaa	I went from not having a period at all to removing the iud, and my period came back right away and was on track did not get prego the first month but i did the second. I also did not bleed after removal. If you would like help determining when you will ovulate and pregnancy tests go to www.early-pregnancy-tests.com. i used the site it works and was help full for getting prego.|`|hlztyMYyaa	I did not conceive for 1yr 2months after removing the iud and my cycle was way outta whack for months but I have finally conceived and am happy|`|C6wO9ixpaa	Hi there,  It didn't change my cycle at all. I conceived 6 weeks after removal, everything was right on schedule for ttc. Other people may have diff. experiences though.
oojO4WAraa	No.  It was her foolish mistake.  She should have aborted 6 of those babies.  Humans are not suppose to have litters of babies.|`|Dhsyroekaa	I think no!!!!!!!! If she could get away with it then everyone else will do the same!! I hate her!|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I don't think the she should have had 8 babies I mean if you have 6 already what makes you want more? Has she not watched John and Kate plus 8. Right there will tell you how hard it is to have 6 at a time let alone 8 babies. I think that she should have to pay the bill herself.   But I'm sure most people will considered me mean.|`|8WRnqs08aa	Apparently, she's got money to raise these babies, so who are we to judge?    However, in the event that that is not true then I do not feel that it is the responsibility of us taxpayers, but we're paying for everyone elses kids, so why should she be an exception?    Politics?? {sigh}|`|m25lpepOaa	I agree with LA.    I'm assuming that fertility treatments were used, and when you use that kind of treatment, the person using them is made well aware of the chance that they may have sets of multiple children. It is a risk that they chose to take. If they could not afford the children then they should not have taken the treatment.|`|596ddaee42df0ec8a6b9d7b4242c6338aa	I hate questions like this.  yes, taxpayers should pay.  not for the sake of the mother, but because they are innocent little babies.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Well, I don't understand why anyone with 6 kids would want to have more but to each their own I guess. It doesn't matter. We have to pay the same amount of taxes no matter who uses it. She will get so many book and tv deals that is what will pay for her children. She will be a millionaire in no time. Besides I agree with the lady above me. I would much rather pay for them to live than for an abortion for some irresponsible woman that refuses to use protection and uses abortion as a form of birth control.       That is HORRIBLE what PJ said about aborting 6 of them!! How could anyone do that? Choose which of your children should live and die? No way could I live with myself if I made the choice to kill some of them.|`|fHjSonssaa	It's a really messed up situation.  I don't think it's ethical that the woman got fertility treatment after already having 6 kids.  However- now that those babies are born, are you suggesting they NOT be in an incubator if they NEED to be?  The babies shouldn't have to suffer just because the woman messed up.  So I guess I'm trying to look at it like this:  no, I don't want to pay for it- however I also don't think the babies should have to suffer due to her- so I want them to recieve the care they need.  I just think she should have to pay a portion back- or make sacrifices on her behalf as well.|`|uZuIo4rOaa	No, i dont think its our responsibility to pay for this. I heard that she's getting about $700 for each kid..   Its pathetic.|`|14f43f349bb66eb9fca9c31edef61771aa	hell no!!!! but u know we are. Food stamps, and all.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Well, us taxpayer now help pay for abortions since obama has lifted his ban and I would much rather pay for a baby to live than to pay for one to die.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	No but we are going to pay for it anyway. Though I read an article saying she wants Opera to give her a 2 million dollar contract for her to be on the show.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Taxpayers are paying for a lot worse than that. Ever heard of the war in Iraq?|`|xeS8pUfbaa	well she pays taxes too|`|O1OZNl1Qaa	I think that we should help the children, but not her. It's not the children's fault they were born. But she should have to pay the bill after it's all over! It's crazy to have that many children knowing you can't afford them on your own.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Yes and no. You cant just leave a baby alone that needs to be in an incubator, that's just cruel to the baby. the mother should have a job, but you cant let a baby suffer because of the mothers stupidity.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	No, we shouldn't.  However, we have to because it wasn't the fault of the babies that they were brought into the world this way.  It's very selfish and irresponsible of people to have children when they can't take care of them.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	There are honestly many more things that my tax dollars go to that I hate way more.|`|VT24zOomaa	no, if your unemployed and already have 6 kids your getting help raising, why on earth would you even have 1 more?    this woman is delusional, and i hope she got her tubes tied.|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	We should not but we will. I think the doctor that helped her should be fired an his lic taken away. I rlly think she did this for money an fame. Why would someone with 6 kids already with no bf or hubby want more kids? then do something risky that could give u more then 1.   There is talk she already has book deals going out to her. I feel bad for these babies an her other kids. This should of never took place!!|`|PCsW0gbPaa	Ideally, they shouldn't.  It's not "fair" for you to have to pay for something that's the result of someone else's irresponsibility.    But come on, let's be civilized rather than anti-social.  If we want to have a society, we are going to have to help some people some times.  No one really makes it in the world by themselves.  We all depend on eachother (you didn't grow the gotton, spin the thread, weave the fabric, and sew the pattern for the shirt you are wearing, and I'm sure you've made messes that the public has had to clean up).  This is just a matter of degree.  Even though it's pretty egregious.    Besides, are you suggesting that the right answer is no, that we should let those babies die?  Doesn't that lead us down the road of murdering our poor and sick to cull the herd?    We can not depend on individual conscience and charity to handle these cases.  Please don't insist that we can.  Kenny Lay (a millionaire) stole the retirement funds of average workers.  If we want to save those babies' lives, the taxpayer has to step in.|`|edLbogmYaa	Nope! And it's pretty f'ed up if we do have to pay for all of those freaking kids?  When a person decides to  have 14 children they should be financially prepared to take care of their children and not depend on all of the tax payers to do it! It's not right!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	No she is STUPID!  Sorry but for someone who has 6 kids to have or want to do fetility treatments is selfish and oh did I say STUPID why have kids you can't afford!!!!|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	If you were that lady, would you want to have to pay for everything on your own? I know that she hasn't made the best decisions, but I don't think that her kids should have to suffer for it. I think that it would be sad for society to turn its back on people who really need it. I do, however, feel that instead of having all of the tax cuts that are offered to people with children that we (yes, I have a kid) should instead be taxed for a little bit more, because we use more services that tax dollars pay for.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Absolutely not. And we shouldn't have to pay for abortions either!|`|yB5go5wbaa	It's not those babies faults...|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	They shouldnt.  But they are still children in need.  There are stupid/half psycho parents everywhere.      However, I do find the clinic pretty liable in this.  And sadly, is a good example, of why insurance companies dont want to pay for things like IVF and fertility treatments.  If any good comes of this, I think its to look at the ethics of some of these clinics, both in doing something like this, and in not sharing their research to bring down the costs, so people dont think each try is a gamble, and have to use so many eggs.|`|PPqQ7yuDaa	No, but I feel like we can't just babies die. That girl is crazy though. Why would she have fertility treatments and she can barely take care of the six.  She should have her babies taken away from her.
264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	For my baby shower gifts I sent out thank you cards after.  I just bought a pack (all the same) and wrote a little something in them like:  "Dear ______, Thank you so much for the outfit for Kaitlyn, I can't wait to see her in it.  It's so adorable!  It was so good seeing you at the shower!  XOXO, Nicole"  or  "Dear_______, Thank you very much for the gift card.  I didn't really get any bath towels at the shower, so I was thinking of using it for that.  It was wonderful seeing you at the shower!  Thank you!     Just keep them short and sweet.  But, do add a little personal touch to each one.|`|zQG7xOapaa	Try to see this link and maybe it can help u.      http://www.my-thank-you-site.com/|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	A package of cards that are identical is just fine for thanking people. The important thing here is the message you write, not the card itself.    The wording you choose should be simple...    "Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness and the lovely gift! We appreciate the (name of gift) and your kindness to our family."    (Your name)|`|GPW6HUZFaa	Just buy a pack of them.  It's cheaper than buying individual ones.  All you have to say is thank you for your gift and sign your name.  Or, if you remember what everyone got for you, say thank you for the...we love it and sign your name.  It's the thought that counts.|`|4WNeBRjVaa	I got a pack with all the same for my wedding then just wrote thank you for whatever they got me. Try to make it personal, that's all. Nothing to major though. You don't need to spend hours people know you appreciate it!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I usually buy a pack of thank you cards but write something personal in it.  Like in this case something that acknowledges the specific gift they got you.  Nothing is worse than getting a thank you card where someone just signs their name and doesn't personalize it in any way.  There's really no point in that.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Go and buy a pack of cards - they all are normally the same for the same occasion.      Dear _________ :    Thank you so much for the cute/adorable ___________ that you got for me and baby (Insert name).  I can't wait until he/she is here and will be able to use/wear it.  Your thoughtfulness is greatly appreciated.    Thank you,  ____________|`|5DJcir9saa	Buy a pack of thank you cards, otherwise you'll end up spending a fortune!  Just take a few moments to personalize each card.  And be sure to hand write at least the card, but both the card and the envelope would be best.  Thank them for both attending the shower (if they attended) and the gift they brought.  Be sure to mention the exact gift, that way they know you took the time to personalize the card.  If someone got you money or a gift card, I would write what you plan to use it for.  Example:  Thank you for the $50 gift certificate.  I am going to put it towards the cost of a high chair.    It will only take an hour or so to do and it is very necessary to personalize.  I attended a shower for my cousin's wife and she sent out a note from the computer and it was obvious that she typed it once and then printed off enough copies for everyone.  I would have rather received nothing in response to the gift I gave.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You can buy packaged thank-you cards.  But inside each card you must write an individual method and sign it.     Short and sweet is fine.    "Dear Mary,    I'm so glad you were able to come to the shower.  Thank you very much for the sleepers. They are adorable and I'm sure baby will get a lot of use out of them.    Love,    Cheyenne|`|zwctZ812aa	I bought the packages of identical cards and wrote essentially the same thing in everyone.  Thank you for coming to the shower and for _______________________.  Hope to see you again soon,   Short and sweet...low stress for me.  On some I added little things about how adorable the baby will be in the outfit, or how I can never have enough diapers...but nothing too involved.|`|bL3rzrEYaa	Depends on how much time you have to spend.  I wrote out notes on each of mine thanking them for the gifts, and naming some of the things they got me and why i loved them so much.  Just buy a pack of Thank You Cards, way cheaper. Good luck new mama!|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	Buy a pack of "all the same" cards that have a little thank you note already inscribed in them.  You just add a little "thanks so much for the beautiful outfit.  Caleb will be beautiful in it", kinda thing to it.  Sign it and send it off.    Congratulations and best wishes to you on your impending arrival!!!
eISzHe5maa	Some of the top students in my school that are guys are in the choir and in band as well. In fact one of the guys in my school who was in band and I think choir as well got a perfect score on his ACT. Some of these guys that I sing with (I'm in the A Capella and Madrigal Choir as well) are also some of the nicest, most polite, the most ambitious, and hardworking students in the school and they all have a ton of discipline. And there are a few that have 0 interest in sports but have such a huge passion for the arts.     I think you need to get your head out of your *** and stop being such a close minded idiot. Your son is just fine, he's not going to "become gay" from being interested in the choir or the arts. Who knows if your son has such a huge passion for singing and wants to continue to get better and study professionally, he could become the next Josh Groban or even Andrea Bocelli.     If anybody has the problem - it's you.  If he was gay would you love him any less than if he were straight? If so I think you're a very sick and disgusting person.|`|XSTjyO1naa	It's time consuming, but you don't seem to find more time to spend with your son. Get close to him so that you know him better, start taking at first, interests in his activities, his liking, to develop trust in him. Thereafter, building trust-worthy relations, you can realize him the meaning of life, and stuffs he is growing through. Spend quality time with him to know him, to advice him better.|`|0L3tqpEVaa	When I was young I sang in chorus (all four years of high school) both soprano and bass.  I star gazed and never had any interest in sports (still don't).  I now work in a prison (last ten years) and walk among people who are killers, rapest and have commited any crime you could think of.  Does that make me a castrato?|`|4AJkaIkqaa	unnarrowing your mind is probably the best start.  Also, if your son is gay whats the big deal, as long as he's happy is all that matters.
mgiJVjaKaa	You may be going through other hormonal changes. Has your diet changed at all? Stress level? Sleep? All of those (and more) can affect your period and your body.
602016aa7f99bac454bdfa2b02ce7b96aa	Congratulations MaryG :)  I know you have posted considering a fifth child before now and understand that now you have what you want you are feeling overwhelmed at the reality.  Go back to your question last week which tallks about all of your hopes for another and smile.  You know as much as I do pregnancy is a toll so do take it easy as much as you can.  You have given the greatest gift of all to your children, another brother or sister to walk through life with when you are gone. BRAVO  Remember there are many ignorant people here who don't have a clue who you are, but you are a wonderful mum balancing work and motherhood regardless of all of the preconceived ideas of others who automatically put 2 and 2 together and come up with 19.  Good luck, I wish you so much wellness and joy.  Those who say you cannot love a fifth child as much as your first do not have five children.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Um...suck it up and deal with the baby?  Or think about alternatives?|`|cQ0fEQBhaa	Troll, much.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	get your tubes tide this time? or use birthcontrol after this baby is born?|`|ZusC87WBaa	Congratulations!  You must feel very overwhelmed, especially since your other kids are still so young.  I'm not sure what your question is, but my thinking is that after the first four, you probably figured out how all of that happened.  Time to call your obgyn.  Good luck.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	You have 3 options. Abortion, adoption or keeping the child. Explore your options and choose what is best for you, your spouse and other children.|`|UaL28atDaa	do another test to be sure. If you are pregnant than this will be very helpful for you. Its all about being pregnant while caring for other children its really useful.     http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...|`|RnFpjFODaa	it's not the baby's fault that's for sure|`|qXvFsnOcaa	Get a good OBGYN, shop for baby cloths, and do a Google search on the word "CONDOM".|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Use protection and stop having babies that you aren't prepared to take care of. Duh!|`|W492U39Iaa	Explore your options and make a decision.  Because all your children are still so young, I'm sure you're scared and extremely overwhelmed.  Talk to someone you trust and ignore the rude comments some people will make.  Do the responsible thing from this point on.|`|d8h5h8IVaa	Get an abortion, you have too many kids!|`|NWv9hOFYaa	So, was it something not planned or what? Either way congratulations! I'm sure you know what's good for your children.  I just think that women should space their pregnancies, so they don't get older and heavier faster. Also, so the younger children don't feel kind of ignored. Just my personal opinion.  Congratulations.  By the way, what was your question?|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	You must be in shock right now! What you need to do is tell your husband. You two need to discuss what to do next.|`|AA12041870	Get ready to put your 7 month old into a regular bed and ready to put your new baby into the crib.  I think you're lucky.|`|dPyfP0ijaa	An unexpected pregnancy is devastating. I know when I found out I was pregnant with my daghter I cried and cried. she was only my second, but I was divorced, not with the father, and very very young, no job, living with my father, etc.    I cried and asked God to take away this pregnancy since I could never have an abortion, but I considered it. I went ahead with eating healthy, going to doc appointments, doing what you do, I hid the pregnsncy from my father.    When the afp test bame back positive for downs syndrome, I totally freaked. Again I prayed, this time for forgiveness for being so selfish. How could I not love or want this gift God has given me??    I prayed that everything would be ok and after they did the thing wth the huge needle into my belly, turnes out I had a healthy normal baby girl. She is 7 now and she is the light of my life, the most beautiful, loving soul and I thank God for letting me be her mommy.     It wasn't easy, but trust in him and you'll be taken care of.    I'm not even religious anymore, so I'm not trying to push God on you or anything, just telling you my experience.    Everything will be fine. Each kid gets easier. You will find that your life was not complete until this little guy or girl has been a part of it.
AA10764658	Well, my dear, you got to do what you got to do!  Who's first, your child or your ex?  You are too worry about your ex behavior and not worry about your son's needs.   You can't force the horse to drink water, you can only lead him to the water!  Child support is the answer!  Let your child decide if he wants to have a relationship with his father.  By the way his father is behaving, I guess your child might not even want to meet him!|`|GxlkhRfoaa	If a 26 year old BOY is not man enough to want to be in the child's life he created on his own then he doesn't deserve to have the joy of a child.  It's his loss and in my opinion you and your child are better off without him.  Be strong as it sounds like you are and that's all your child will need.|`|bmoCpcdraa	i would take notes where he works and  take him to court 1 time to prove he is father than try to keep in touch down the road|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	that happened to me with my ex and my first two baby's.  I finally gave up and found a great man that is responsible and him hitting the road is the best thing to happen to us :) cut him lose and take him to court for custody and support|`|FgAPXhVRaa	My ex is the same way except we dated for 2 years. Some men no matter how old still have a lot of growing up to do, but the one thing that I have learned through my 5 months of my ex is that you CANNOT make him want to be a father. He will either choose to or not choose to... The only thing that you can do is file for child support. I am sorry that you are experiencing this too. It baffles me how men know that a possible consequence of having sex is pregnancy, yet when it comes to taking responsibility they run! Good luck and be strong and realize that if you have to do this yourself... you can!|`|em8A42Bqaa	You may just have to come to terms with being a single parent b/c all guys dont come around EVER!  I think that I learned early on that it is best to be married when you have a child and even then you still run the risk of being (eventually) a single parent.  As Moms we have to be the responsible ones so I wouldnt worry about him he is missing out and even though its tough to do it alone, you have to do what you have to do!      He can support the child financially since he is going be a big basketball star! :)|`|xeS8pUfbaa	tell him that if he doesnt become involved then you will rape him on child support and he will never pay off his loans!|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I would send him a picture of the baby when it's born and if that doesn't change his mind nothing will. You can't really make someone be a parent and your baby deserves better than him if he acts that way. Lot's of people can MAKE children it takes someone special to be a mommy or daddy. I had this problem with my daughters "dad" but then I met a guy who loved her, wanted to be there for her and chose to be her daddy.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	with tha father of my first child i just gave up after my son turned a year old. i had already found a new guy that treats my son as his own. just move on put him on child support send him pics sometimes so when your child gets older you cant say you didnt try to get him involved in his life. but other than that there isnt much you can do except take care of this child and give it all the love it needs|`|joPJtKemaa	He is not ready to become a father, sue him for child support and don't try contacting him again. If he wants to be in the baby's life he will come around, if he does not you will find someone who will love you and your baby.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	Well you should have protected yourself from letting this happen to you from a man you knew for less than 2 months. I think that was very irresponsible of you to bring a child into this world with a man you hardly know. If the father to your child doesn't want to be apart of his life then don't make him. If you try and force him to be apart by showing him ultrasound pics that he obviously doesn't want to see and guilt him into being a father he will just resent the baby and you and the baby will be worse off than if you left this man alone and raised the baby yourself. This man obviously doesn't have feelings for you or your baby and he would rather start a family with another woman that he loves. Make him pay child support because that is his responsibility but leave the man alone and don't force him into being your boyfriend or your baby's daddy. you had an option to protect yourself or to abort the baby and you still have the option of giving the baby up for adoption and honestly if your willing to make such immature decisions like having unprotected sex with a man you hardly know then your too immature to raise a baby.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	You can't make him, or even convince him to be a part of the child's life. Yes he's probably scared right now, but he's also a jerk. Real men step up and face their responsibility. If I were you, I would not call or email him anymore. What's the use in wasting your time calling him if he's only going to give you attitude? That will only stress you out more. Send him a final email letting him know that this is your last effort to try to get him more involved. Let him know you're going to stop calling and emailing him and it's up to him if he's going to be a father or not. Let him know that if he doesn't step up, you plan to take out child support when the baby's done. Most importantly, you need to say it and mean it. Best wishes to you.
nBlSS6HUaa	My daughters DR just told me last week. The ear therometer is the worse thing out there. If you don't have it int he ear just right...it will givbe out all kinds of weird readings. For instance..my daughter had a temp of 101.8 but MY ear therometer said 97.0 another time said 93.4 so...I am going with the old fashion under the pit, rectle, or mouth...I don't trust the ear ones anymore. She could have had something very serious happen to her if I believe what it said. (of course I knew better than that because she was acting sick and burning up...so I used someone else's, then took her to the dr)    GOOD LUCK|`|h6kTWuNVaa	pediatricians do not recommend ear thermometers, as they are typically always inaccurate.     my ped said that the ear part doesn't correctly fit a childs ear, therefore it wont measure an accurate reading.     It is so dangerous for a thermometer to be off even by 1 degree! That could be a life or death situation for your child.    Best to use is a cheap under the arm thermometer for that age.     Good Luck!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	It's funny you say that, I have a Summer one that seems to read too cold. I don't think my body temp is 35, so it's not likely to pick up a fever accurately.  It very annoying considering it cost over 20.|`|lr9E8IC5aa	I have found that any digital thermometer is crap. I have 3 different kinds and get 3 different readings.    i use the good ole fashioned one...sometimes, the best instrument is the one that's been around forever. there are something people should not try to improve.
Kl1h5dCaaa	NOTHING.    I am so proud, now excuse me whilst I jump on my bragging wagon.    I was always told, I couldn't do my dream job, by everyone except my Dad. Dad had faith in me, but I don't think he totally believed I could do it.  When I finished year 12, I was faced with the cold hard truth of the real world. University was expensive, and my Foster Parents couldn't help me out, my Dad was very ill at that moment. When I got my letter, saying I was accepted, I was so proud. I literally cried. I showed my Dad, and he was very sick. He told me to do what ever I had to do to make my dreams come true.  Since then I've worked my butt off, to make it work for me. And I did it. My Dad wasn't around to see me Graduate, but I know he would be so proud of me.    All my life I was told I couldn't do it, and guess what, I am DOING IT. I bought into my Business a few years ago, and have security and I love it. It has taken a back place to my family now, but I am happy.|`|5p7gpj36aa	I've been busy living someone elses (broken) dreams for a while.  Letting mine get kinda pushed away... but things are a changing this year.  I hope.      sooo Which one?  -- I think I still might be able to go to nursing school... and for scuba diving I do plan on learning that someday, as for being an instructor though, who knows,.... and the 1-800 number could be a reality if I can figure out if it's a wanted thing and then how to make it work.    The only one that I don't think I could really do is travel the world to help animals and people.  ..  I guess I could do that right here in my own town.    Charlie,  I'm glad your happy.  It's nice to hear.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Because if you ask me your previous question again tomorrow, I will have a different answer.  The next day.... a different answer.  I changed my major 4 times in college.  I am extremely indecisive.    Carrie... I hope that's true.  I am indecisive with most all things, not just this.  I wonder if the *I'll pay for your school and you pay for your books* offer that my mom made me 15 years ago will still stand.  (LOL!)|`|cAtWxJG1aa	total lack of qualifications    combined with family obligations, qualifications in another field that i'm pretty good at, and difficulty figuring out how i would go about starting over from ground zero in a new field with four kids.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Money.    I didn't answer your other ?, but my dream job is to be a stay at home mom.    I just can't afford it.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Right now me just being on bed rest....  I have my dream job.   I was fortunate, my husband and I got our careers together then started a family. We were married 13 years before having our first.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	My dream job is to be a SAHM. But honestly, I'm just not cut out for it. I tried it for 10 months, and I just had to go back to work.

It's just not me.|`|j2mRop0laa	Well, I sort of answered this is your last question. I do it for free, already for people I know and I don't feel like making it a *job*. It's too fun. :)|`|NuvKPl3naa	raising a family. i dont mind much on being there at 5:00 and kids getting out at 3:00, i think its more of the class programs, field trips, when the kids are sick i dont have family to help out, and just keeping up with all the stuff in the day.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I am honestly doing my dream job right now. All growing up I wanted to be a good wife and a great mother. That is what I am doing right now. I am raising three beautiful children ages 5,2, and 2 months.

My husband's job can't pay our bills alone so I can quit & go to college full-time so I must work.

I would have to go to school to get a job with a decent paycheck and right now we cant afford it and also my youngest is 18 mos. I dont think I could handle her and school work.. I've been thinking about maybe starting school next fall. I'm either going for dental assistong or medical billing. Neither is my dream job but they are easy to train to and pretty reliable as in getting a job afterwards.   My dream job would be wedding planning but that is too time consuming and most hours would be on the weekends and evenings so I guess my family is keeping me from that too. I dont mind though. Maybe once my kids are a lot older :)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	two little kids, laziness, fear of failing - probably the last one is the biggest factor|`|505c28ffab4b949ab353bc9f3870e311aa	Giving up my benefits.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Whats delaying me is i have not even finished high school yet..Im  only in grade 10..(yes im 15)|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I made sure I did my dream jobs before I was married and pregnant.

It's too unstable to do while raising kids in my opinion. 3 months in a jungle, then 6 months in a desert, then 4 months "home", then another 6 months in some rainforest somewhere....doesn't really mesh with raising kids lol. I wouldn't be comfortable having them travel with me for it all either. They'd never have a sense of home.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Money and raising my kids, I have a 13 month old and am due in March with our second.      I am dying to go to culinary school.

AkFag8tNaa	I'm a mom and step mom. I have only met my stepson's mother twice and talked to her on the phone less than a handful of times so we get along fine. I also get along w/my ex's wife almost to the point of considering her a good friend. The only issue I would ever have is if she tried to be his mother and vice versa.|`|AA10186411	I am the biological mother.  So I will give you my take on it.  I think this "woman" who is "attempting" to be my daughter's stepmother is a crazy *****.  She won't even be seeing my daughter again. :)|`|lzivF4Idaa	ughh...i get random girls calling me//emailing me and threatening me about my ex. then when i ask him about it, he says he doesnt know or talk to any other girls lol.     guess they arent that special. my take on it is, if you're cool with me then im cool with you.|`|5WYeHh0paa	My husband has a 2 year old from a previous relationship. They were never married and hardly got along according to him. She moved to the other side of the country with the baby about a year and a half ago. I've only just met her  and their son recently and we were civil to each other. I'm currently pregnant with our first child together and she seems interested and wants to be kept updated on it. I would like to have his son involved alot more because well in the end, he will be my sons older half brother.    But so far, we're fine.|`|oXrDKjkkaa	No.  My husband is a wonderful man, but when he was married before, his wife cheated on him.  She treated him terribly throughout and after the divorce.  I cannot stand her and I am sick of her idea that we can all be one big happy family.|`|DNcbNBcuaa	My husband has a 8 year old daughter.  He also was never married to her mother.  Luckily I don't have to worry about the ex because her mother has not attempted to see or call her in almost 3 years.  He has had custody since she was 1 1/2 years old.  Since then, her mother would occasionally get her on weekends.  I really hate it for my stepdaughter that her mother doesn't want to be in her life.|`|dq04utMoaa	I am the Bio Mom.... My ex and I were married for 2 years. He started seeing her before we were divorced... Anyways they have been together for 10 years now. Anyways I really do not care for the new wife and the only reason why is because she seems to think I want my ex back, I have been married to my new husband for 7 years and have another child who is 5 and one on the way... So with all that said she keeps him from calling her or seeing our daughter.. which is sad however my daughter has a wonderful step father who loves her alot... We dont really worry about my ex and only care about the child support...  my ex does not call me and I dont call him so its all good....  It helps that he lives in KY and I live FL|`|fbqrIdkuaa	I'm the bio mom.    When I first met her, I really liked her.  She seemed very nice and he seemed happy, so I was happy.    But then things got a little wonky.  She over stepped a few boundaries.  I didn't think that it was a big deal because I didn't think (and still don't) that it was done with anything but innocents; but it upset my daughter so I brought it up that some things just needed to stay my area.  (Like shopping for personal clothing.)  Anyway...she did not take that very well.    It apparently was also a big problem for her that I was still considered a part of his family.  His sister and parents still included me in all of the family get togethers and she took issue with this and started to make things very uncomfortable.    Oh well...You can't have everything I guess.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	My husband's ex is a little intimidated by me. My husband gave her the impression that I am a 'tough lady' so she's very cautious around me. We think it's hilarious.    But we do get along. It took awhile. We've never argued or had bad words but in the beginning I couldn't stand her because she was constantly calling my husband to talk about how badly her new husband was treating her.     But two years later, she's stopped doing that. We now sit together at school recitals and talk on the phone when she calls her son. She plays with our son and constantly tells us how cute he is. The only thing I can't stand is her constant talk about money. She's drilled it into her son's head that without money you're a nobody (she married a rich doctor 20+ years her senior). Subsequently we have to always be reminding my stepson that just because we don't have a boat like they do doesn't mean we're any less important.    But she and I - we're fine.

But when it's my husband it is much more annoying.  He still leaves his dirty clothes on the bathroom floor after a shower.  That drives me nuts!  I have to talk to his mother about that one.  Did she just follow him around picking up his dirty underwear or something?  Oh and when he cooks.....don't even get me started on that one.  My husband has many good qualities.  Cleaning up after himself is not on that list.  Sorry for the rant!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My kids then my hubby then my dog. My dog is the best.

He's not a boy and I'm not his mother so I can't see why I should have to clean up after him.
mhxZWtSFaa	he might just be joking with you i say that all the to my girl!! and i don't think about kids right now!!|`|8DsbSALzaa	He juz wanna chck either he is fertile or not nothn else !!|`|v3LnJycKaa	most people make jokes about uncomfortable situations... if you two are being irresponsible about unprotected sex, then it is a possibility that he has the "consequence" on his brain and mentions it so you will undoubtedly say don't be silly, Im not pregnant and subconsciously reassure him|`|ZusC87WBaa	I think the possibility of getting a woman pregnant makes some men feel more "manly".  I wouldn't read any more into it than that.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Maybe he wants a baby? Or maybe he's trying to get to you?  Are you on birth control?|`|Dhsyroekaa	umm he wants to trap you to make you stay with him? Or is imagining a future with you one day.    Makes your on the pill and use condoms just incase until your ready!!|`|xzh8r0jIaa	IT MEANS YOU NEED TO GET ON SOME KIND OF BIRTH CONTROL!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	maybe he does want to have one or wants to at least discuss having one but doesnt want to come right out and say it so he makes jokes. askhim about it.|`|Gr78AFvyaa	he might be trying to see how you react to it. or if your not using birth control he could be trying to get you to.  id be careful though, you don't want him to try and get you pregnant without you knowing!|`|2Q7vDzcCaa	that's how my bf was too... and he did got me pregnant. But the good thing that came out is that i love my baby so much! she's my proud and joy! Tell your bf if he wants to make you pregnant now... your going to apply for child support! that's what i did to my bf. so if he did some s2pid stuff... you have the baby plus the financial support!|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	I think this is a question best asked to your boyfriend directly rather than a bunch of strangers that don't even know him. I'm not being rude, I'm just being realistic: you can't take anything anyone tells you here seriously in regards to his attitude because we don't know him, you, or your relationship.    Ask him what he means by it. If you aren't ready, remind him that you have some goals set that you would like to accomplish before becoming a mom--and if that includes marrying him--make sure he knows it. Good luck!|`|W492U39Iaa	I'm not sure what your boyfriend's personality is like, but I would HIGHLY recommend that you get on the pill if you're not on it already.  Some guys have been known to purposely make a girl pregnant to "trap" them, so to speak.  Just be cautious.|`|XQIbx7Plaa	It sounds to me like he wants to maybe take the next step of commitment.  He is probably playing with the idea of one day having a baby with you.  Which I think is typical in a  healthy relationship.|`|O1lm79EFaa	I think it maybe turns him on... the idea of getting you pregnant...He may not be 100% serous about actually go on with his "fantasy" just something he may say to make himself feel more masculine
ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, she's probably pregnant, but I have heard that First Response has been giving women false positives lately.  Now, keep in mind that my very first positive I got was with First response, but that was back in 2007 and they have changed them since then.   I hope she is pregnant!!!  =)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	First Response has worked the best for me, those with "false positives" were pregnant for a short time - which is more common then we realize.    Take a test tomorrow with whatever one you want, and use the morning's first urine - it has the highest [hCG] then later in the day.|`|BO28Mn8haa	my first response said not-pregnant, and I wasnt pregnant.. so I guess it worked well|`|9ncWshWBaa	last time i was pregnant in the very early stage I got negatives with First Response but Positive with Sainsbury's own brand. I found that interesting because Sainsbury's brand was so much cheaper.    I think that if one is not sure of if a negative is true or not then test with a couple of other brands too.|`|BaXruEcqaa	Well I didnt get any positives with the First response OPK.  I havent tried the HPT yet....I will in a few days.|`|P4RM3s3Kaa	I tested a week before my period was due and got a clear positive with 1st response.its the only test i use.x
rE9J1DqTaa	I have have the same pants lol.  My mom hates my style but i look at her and say "Its on my body not yours so why do you even care let me be who i wanna be and let me dress the way i wanna dress" I only had to say that to her once after that she went shopping for me and bought the stuff that I LIKED not the stuff that she wanted me to wear.|`|6gthdHpnaa	Respect your mom's decision and don't wear the chains, the jeans still look good without them.  If you were my kid, I wouldn't let you buy forty-nine dollar pants.|`|HOdblqIkaa	I would. I never liked that trend I thought it looked kinda trashy. We weren't allowed to have chains in school and I know if I had ever come home with pants like that my parents would make me take them back. If she doesn't want you to wear the chains don't wear them around her.|`|7SCjPftKaa	They're not offensive, she just probably equates that kind of style with generally antisocial 'bad kids' who smoke weed and drink or just emo/goths in general. It's probably been a while since she was a teen herself and plus she was from a completely different generation so she'll look at them differently than just a pair of trousers. It's likely that she either doesn't like the idea of you moving in that direction yourself of just doesn't want other people to look down on you by thinking that you are one of those kind of girls. They're not really a smart pair of trousers.    To be honest, I would let you wear them. Way better that than showing your knickers under a miniskirt or those obsenely short denim hotpants. As long as you're not flashing your bits around then live and let live...|`|E6T9DPT9aa	To be honest, I would let you wear them. I just like they look a bit ugly though.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|3LvlXDOAaa	that's ridiculous, your mother really has to learn to pick her battles.  i think they're lovely btw (so does my mom lol i showed her)|`|Z7dShLRLaa	If my duaghter liked them.

AA10118973	I would handle it as follows. As your son's primary care MD. you should never ever have to fight to get an appt. So I would start looking for a new one after your current issue is resolved. I would get the permission needed to go to urgent care. YOU as his mother know him best and any good doctor would listen to what his patient's mother is saying after all you are with him all day every day. So please go and get your baby the help he needs. Good luck and let me know how it goes. I hope it is just a virus and that he will recover quickly. God Bless.|`|AA11431474	Just remember that his age it's also perfectly normal for them to slow down on their eating. Around 2 they suddently start eating a lot less, then one day they will eat you out of house and home, and then go back to hardly eating anything. And if they haven't been feeling well, it's likely to make him not want to eat much. Don't judge his condition on whether or not he is eating much, because at that age they frequently aren't all that hungry anyway, even if he ate like a horse previously. Does he have a fever? Is he drinking fluids? It's ok if he doesn't eat much, but make sure he has some apple juice, water, baby gatorade stuff, whatever. Is he acting like himself more or less?  Kids get sick now and then, and most of the time they're fine in a day or 2. Don't panic, and it's not always necessary to be seen by a doctor every time they sneeze or decide not to eat a full meal.|`|AA10321198	He might have a sore throat from the sinus drain or nasal drip.  We get it too.  So image for a baby getting it.  They have always said give him water or fluid and he well ate.  Just give it time.  There is a nasty thing going around.  Sounds like allergies with the eyes.  But he will eat try giving him ice cream instead or frozen Popsicles.  It will help.|`|InZU5aaxaa	Take to a different doctor if you don't feel comfortable. Also try the B.R.A.T.(T.) diet.     bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (tea)    Some doctors say yes to the tea others say no. This is helpful with sick children with upset stomachs. Also bland so he may eat since he picked the crackers.     Good luck.|`|AR8AyFqbaa	hun calm down firstly    there is a tummy flu going around  my son has it    make sure he drinks he will tell you when he wants food    my son is sick with it he hasnt eaten since sunday. well not really its a virus and takes a week or so to pass through him    go to a regular er and get him checked i hated base doctors as well ans generally skipped them all together|`|AA11327039	Do you think he might be having an allergic reaction to the antibiotic.  My daughter had a reaction to one antibiotic which kept her from eating or sleeping for almost 2 days straight.  It was worse than the illness itself so I took her off the medicine completely and she got better within a couple of days.    She had another reaction to a different antibiotic which caused her to get all red and itchy and get little 'pimples' all over her skin.    She's allergic to antibiotics.|`|AA12344593	Okay your boy has some kind of sickness because of the obvious fever he's trying to sweat out. He doesn't want to eat and he won't eat because he is not well. Don't force him to eat solids especially if he has the flu which it could be because he will just vomit. Give him some water, pedialyte, chamomile tea, or chicken broth to drink. Take all of his clothes off and leave him in his underwear because he has a fever; he needs to cool off. Put a cool wet cloth on his head or give him a cool bath. You need to get that fever down. I wouldn't worry about not eating right now and whatever you do don't give him any dairy right now. Fever will cause it to sour and he will vomit. Just get him to drink some fluids and bring his fever down. He just needs to lay down and be cooled off and have some fluids. I don't really know about base dr.s or anything like that but if he gets worse then I would go to the hospital or something. I wouldn't wait around. If he has the flu then he may be nauseated and that's why he's eating the crackers only. Give him crackers too if he will eat them.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	First, if you are not comfortable w/baby's doctor get a pediatrician off base if you possibly can.  You should trust and be comfortable w/any doctors you or family sees.  Since your child was on antibiotics, this can upset the stomach.  Perhaps his stomach really bother him.  You know, cramps, nausea, etc.  Try giving him some yogurt.  Any flavor you'd think he would like.  Yogurt is very good to eat while on antibiotics anyway because it helps to replace the good bacteria in the intestines which may die off due to the antibiotics.  How are his bowel movements.  Does he have any diarrhea.  This is also common after antibiotics.  Sometimes the antibiotic doesn't work.  He may need another type.  Perhaps his throat is sore and that could be the reason he's not to keep on eating.  (It hurts when he swallows).  As long as he eats a little and most importantly drinks (makes sure he does drink plenty of fluids) he should be ok.  Take him to doctor to ease your mind.  If you have to go back to base dr.  ask him/her if his throat is ok.  Let them know your concerns.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	when children are sick they dont like to eat that how my son is my son will eat all day if i let him but when he was younger he had a fever of 103.1 and we took him to the emergency room they told us that he just has a upper respitory infection (sorry for the spelling) and he didnt eat anything and he had the sweats they prescribe some kind of antibiotic and just told me to keep him hydrated.|`|4U7327Mzaa	I think it might be an ear infection.  My kids would not eat or would only eat a very small amount when they had ear infections.|`|8DhRxcF7aa	if it's worrying you that much, i would definentley call and get permission to take him to ugent care, i hope your little boy feels better|`|AA11586880	I would go to an off base emergency room. He could be dehydrated, and being lethargic is not good. Yes, screw the doctors.....they are not paying good attention to his symptoms , and no one is tuned into your child the same way you are.|`|dxTwHB1yaa	If you are that worried, and he is acting that unusual - then call the urgent care center.     Otherwise just keep in mind that if he's not actually "sick" he could still be worn down and grumpy.
yMfJNatnaa	1st of all you should for sure call your doctor or the hospital but it might me the position of the baby is  resting against your sciatic nerve and your bowls that is causing this . Its always best at the end of your pregnancy to keep in close contact with your doctor with any changes. Good luck with your new bundle of joy.|`|27Uu2IJxaa	Get in to the hospital now and get checked out! You may be in labor, or something else may be going on, but you definitely want to get it checked out. Good luck & congrats!
EmuGiGjJaa	Oh, my you poor thing. My advice is to get some daytime cold medicine to take care of your symptoms. Since your tummy isn't feeling good, eat the medicine with a little plain toast. Keep drinking water, one small sip at time. Make sure when you do sleep at night, you go to bed early, with some nighttime meds to help you get some rest.

ZmLwDhl5aa	Well;  from the sound of it you sound like you may be prego and i`m not trying to sound mean about it but you should realy consider a stick pregnancy test and if it shows up + then you should go to a doctor and get tested again just to be safe also i looked up some sighns of pregnancy and here is what i got so far      Implantation Bleeding:  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping.     Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.      Delay/Difference in Menstruation:  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.    Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.    Swollen/Tender Breasts:  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen.     Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.    Fatigue/Tiredness:  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception.     Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.    Nausea/Morning Sickness:  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.    Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.    Backaches:  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.    Headaches:  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.    Frequent Urination:  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom.     Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.    Darkening of Areolas:  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker.     Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.    Food Cravings:  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy.     Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.      well i hope that helps you out some!!! =]
R7U1sDd1aa	Of course when you get pregnant you have to think of any :"what if's", so you're probably on the safer side by not doing it, but I know that when I want something, I don't like waiting, and of all the things that women do while they're pregnant (nail salons, hair dying, smoking), I would say this one is probably very low risk, and assuming you are probably a mature, competent person that will take care of it, and not let it get infected! Lol..Long story short..I say go for it! 8) I'm an LPN, and unless you let it get so infected that it goes systemic which means to your blood stream, to where it could then harm your child, I would say you are safe, but for god sakes I'm NOT a doctor, so this is just purely an opinion! 8) Good luck.|`|SpcYCBndaa	just be careful not to pierce your  belly|`|hneetSf2aa	not really..and why would you want to|`|rNdun1V7aa	no. period. you always risk disease/infection. why would you even want that right now. ugh...|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Yeah, that'll look REAL classy   O.o  (And I hope you know I'm being sarcastic)|`|bmoCpcdraa	no you could have problems ask your doctor|`|MkCTwE95aa	No. You should not get any type of piercing while pregnant because of the risk of infection. No matter where your piercing is an infection can carry through your blood which ends up going to your baby.|`|NEH7JWNMaa	No, you might inhale the stud & kill the baby.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	No! It's not safe to get any piercings and tattoos while pregnant. Plus, no GOOD parlour will pierce/tattoo a pregnant woman.|`|AA12004844	no, you may get an infection which would require antibiotics which would get to your baby    wait until the baby is born|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I wouldn't risk it|`|MqFeJiukaa	No one of the papers you sign when getting a piercing is stating you are not pregnant, at least when I got mine I did.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Yes, it would be fine.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	No, you can't get a piercing or a tattoo while pregnant.  You don't want to do anything to increase the chance of you having an infection because this could greatly harm or even kill your baby.|`|eMwIh50Qaa	First off...I HAVE MY NOSE PIERCED. It's CUTE and everyone likes it. It's been done for 4 years now. Ignore stupid people and their comments about it being "classy". Anyways, I was wondering the same thing but I am interested in getting another peircing...below my lip. I chose NOT to do it because of all the infections that could develope. You never know and it would be better to be on the safe side, hun.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	yes|`|MMUeOWXUaa	It should be fine, but you might pee a little when they do it. Like when you sneeze.|`|O54og5BHaa	yes it is, as long as you dont faint easily.  piercing your nose wont harm the baby, so go a head!  just dont get your belly pierced pregnent.|`|4cp2eZwbaa	I don't see how it would be unsafe except infection as well as maybe if you aren't good with pain, then it might put a little stress on the baby.  So I don't see why it really wouldn't be that bad to do it! :-)|`|iLZfMaC4aa	Yes, I did it when I was pregnant with my second child. They are not giving you any drugs so go ahead!|`|cr5f5Rubaa	Yes but with all the stress and pain that bieng pregenant brings why would you want to add to that by getting a piercing.  If it gets infected you'l be in real pain.    Waiting until you'v had the baby would be sensible.|`|qW6xdklnaa	You should have thought about that. If you are this concerned  about little things, you're in for it. Kids age you like nobody's business. Tantrums, throwing up, bellyaches,  sleepless nights! That's why I'm childfree. I'm doing myself and the Earth a good service (ain't getting any   larger, and those natural resoures are being swallowed up like mad). Seems like all the wise folks  are goin the childfree route, so I hate to see this world in several years time if we even have one left.

mAiL4SpFaa	Try to take the pregnancy test again, and also see your doctor. Maybe there is a problem...|`|iLZfMaC4aa	Take the test first thing in the am. That is when there is the most of the pregnancy hormone in your pee. And don't use a store brand, every time I did I got a nev answer. Remember your not likely to get a false positive but you can get many false native. If you are, get to the doc right away for prenatal care, its very important to the baby's health, Good luck and early congratulations!|`|9P1cUEF0aa	THE ONLY WAY U WOULD FIND OUT IF URE PREGNANT IS BYING GOING 2DA DOCTOR ,,HE OR SHE WILL TELL U.GOOD LUCK HUN
K5uoaetaaa	Thomeone with a lipth perhaps.  Please don't name your kid that!|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Ok you must really give some thought to this name. You need to think of your child's future. How would that make you feel if you name your child this and if he/she came home and started crying? Please think before naming your child.. this name makes me think of an overweight couch potato|`|XzV4bUeFaa	No I do not like Thibaut.  A person unlucky enough to have been named this by his parents.|`|q791er1naa	an overweight ghoul from a fantasy film or video game like world of warcraft.  honestly, that is an awful name.|`|QmWzBERjaa	When I hear the name Thibaut I think of a middle aged man who still lives in his mom's house. So no I do not like it.|`|NeI9MOhKaa	no not at all. sounds like a thai dish|`|2wyDALHgaa	I've only ever heard this name as a French Canadian family name.  Never as a first name and personally, I don't think it would work well as one.|`|hlztyMYyaa	like thigh-butt? that's horrible you are horrible for suggesting|`|aAqxTw98aa	i like it if youre french.  i imagine a sorta skinny but muscular guy with short black hair.|`|KAoAyGcPaa	kinda hard to pronounce, but it seems mysterious.. i like it!!    pick me for your best answer (y)|`|1V66syCkaa	Not my favorite. It sounds like a last name more then a first name. Reminds me of maybe some scholar or something?|`|6bK5Vfpdaa	A fish face!!!!! That is a really ugly name!|`|0L3tqpEVaa	Wow!  Don't name the kid something that's going to haunt him his whole life...|`|aEmdURPTaa	Thibaut, Thibeault, Thibeau or Thibault are all of French origin.  What you might not know though, is that in French, these are actually last names, not first names.   And not the kind of last name that can interchangeably be used as first name also.  That's one thing that might refrain you from choosing that as a first name for you son... However, it remains a personal decision.
jUO5holFaa	Most pregnant people don't even want to think about this - and WON'T want to answer a question about it! your question is SICK!|`|AA11764194	I lost my twin babies at 16th week.. I had to go for termination.. that My doc induced me to deliver the babies it was like going thru actual labor...      Later he had to perform D&C because the placenta did not came out on its own..    it is almost like delivering a normal baby.. for me it was very painful and heartbreaking to go thru wholething as I heard babies cry in next rooms.. mine was silent|`|bmoCpcdraa	see a doctor soon like now or you will get infection and die no joke|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	it depends, your body may just let it go naturally, but if it doesnt or you dont release everything you may have to have a D&c. at 15 weeks the baby is still rather small, so i dont think delivery would possible.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I already answered this question and said a D&C would be done.  It is an outpatient procedure done at a hospital by a doctor.  The D&C would be scheduled either the next day or within the next few days usually.|`|qnMRtQ3vaa	You wouldn't do anything.They would just tell you that you lost your baby and then you would start crying(if you were a normal person) and blah blah blah|`|8WRnqs08aa	I lost a baby in 2006 at 13 weeks. My doctor scheduled me for the following Thursday (a week later) to go into the office to have seaweed placed on my cervix, then after an hour perform a D & C.    I had my doctor schedule me for a D & C under anrsthesia at the hospital because loosing that pregnancy was so difficult that I wanted to sleep through the removal. I didn't want to see, hear or know anything about the procedure. I went to sleep & awoke without incident.    I cried as soon as they awoke me because I knew that it was real... I had lost my baby forever and nothing could ease that pain I felt.|`|jLNwrVZRaa	I think that at that early stage you would just have bad cramping and heavy bleeding.  The baby is still so small at 15 weeks that your body would naturally push it out.  You would probably only have to go to the hospital if there were some serious complication.|`|qImMwhUHaa	a lot of times the baby will natural come out after a few weeks, if not then a d&c can be schedules. Just to let you know...this isn't a question pregnant mothers really want to hear about. It's pretty rude if you ask me.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Ok if you're doing a skit, I don't see why all of these small details would be relevant.|`|5LgL8FXPaa	I was 14 weeks when i lost my baby   i went for an ultrasound and discovered that the baby had died  so i was told to go home that eventually my body was going to reject the baby and start bleeding , but it didn't happen like they said   3 days later i started getting a really bad fever and chills and fainted there i knew i had to do something so i went to the emergency hospital  and had a dnc done.|`|f6qbRAmvaa	about a few years ago i lost my son i was almost 16 weeks along i didn't know how far along i was bc my medicaid didn't come in on time so one day i started getting contractions and bleeding i knew at that time i was having a miscarriage so i didn't go to the er but like after 24 hours of pain they were like every3 min so when i went to the er and got on the bed i felt pressure and it was the baby coming out and yes it was like if i was in labor but my baby was dead...... so he come out and i didn't have to have a d&c cuz everything came out.... now im going on 28 weeks with a baby girl and i hope everything goes well with this one!!!
H0fXySX9aa	you need to see your doctor who will refer you to an abortion clinic  you cant buy the pills over the counter nor prescription|`|g9ZFjl6paa	u wouldnt know u are a week pregnant!! if u dont want a baby stop being a baby yourself and grow up|`|Dhsyroekaa	its a procedure.    They go up there poke at the baby to break the sac then vacuum it out. There arent any pills.    Make sure its what you want, you could regret it later.|`|sXeyRD9taa	Aww, I really feel bad for you. Usually I get mad at abortion questions but I understand that you really would like to keep him/her but you don't have enough money. Have you ever thought about adoption? I don't know what it's like in the UK but here in the US(I forgot which state, somewhere in the Midwest plains) you can drop your baby off at a hospital and they will take care of him/her.        Have you told your parents/guardian? They'll help you, I hope you think this decision through and don't make the decision based on fear.      EDIT: BEBA I understand where you're coming from because I'm pro-life but you really aren't helping with the "Babies having babies" crap.|`|R7U1sDd1aa	I don't know you or your situation, but I am 18 weeks along with my first baby, and it breaks my heart that you would even consider taking away this innocent little life.  I understand that you are young, and don't have the nessecities to take care of a little one, but there are so many people in this world that would love to be able to say that they are pregnant, but will never know that feeling for whichever their circumstance may be. My mom was only 15, and my dad only 14 when they found out they were having me, and they have really roughed it throughout the years trying to make ends meet for me and my two younger brothers, but if my mom would have chosen to do what you are trying to accomplish, I wouldn't be here right now writing this, or married, or a nurse, or pregnant with my first child a baby boy due in July..Please...Please talk with your family, and expand your options!! Good luck, and please update us on what happens. Hang in there..|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	First of all you can't get abortion pills without a prescription. Second of all, there are so many government programs that will help you raise your child. You are 17 get a job! Apply for medicaid to help with the medical bills. Stop using the "I can't afford it" thing for an excuse. You will just have to get off your butt and do it. Take responsibility for your actions instead of taking the easy way out. Why should your child have to lose it's life for your convenience?  I had a child at 16. I won't lie..it wasn't easy. But I worked hard to finish school and got a part time job. After school I got a full time job and have supported my son ever since. he is now 13 and I love him with all my heart. I can not imagine what my life would have been like without him if I had decided to end his life bc of my choices.|`|rPoy1AI9aa	dont listen to beba.  i know exactly where u r coming from.  for me the condom broke.  oops.  anyways try the phone book or google it and look up abortion or pregnancy.  there r pills but sometimes the pills dont work and u have to do it the other way
SEzIkGNiaa	It will be awkward in the car, just start up a friendly conversation with the parents.  The convo will just flow afterwards.  As for the kids, you could:    Play hide and Seek  Color  Play games  Watch Television  Arts and Crafts|`|G4JxJxaCaa	um... watch t.v., umm. color, paint, play hide and seek, and play outside
pkdDEJd4aa	If someone has sex, they are accepting the risk of becoming pregnant. Period. If people can't accept the consequences of what sex brings they shouldn't do it. Tell her to get a test and be more careful with her life.|`|bmoCpcdraa	it takes several days for the sperm to make it up the hole so no|`|aJTBF7opaa	period generally means no your not pregnant. Ovulation occurs 10-18 days after the first day of your period depending on your cycle. And you can only get pregnant when you ovulate. You would not have a sign the next day especially a period. Tell her to read up on it.
c6702586c95b5021c90acb04c379882daa	You can still have your period and be pregnant.    Since you are not able to go purchase a pregnancy test. Your very best bet would be to visit www.webmd.com    Do not take advice from any yo-yo on here. Unless of course he's a Doctor. But then again, how can that be proven.|`|AA11764194	Samething happened to me    I got positive pregnancy result and within few days I started bleeding heavily with painful cramping..

You will find no peace of mind without either or those.  Generally, when a pregnant woman loses a twin, it is absorbed by her body, very rarely is it expelled from the body.|`|rNdun1V7aa	my dear get to a clinic asap for a test. you could be risking your health as well not to mention you need prenatal care if you are. hurry!!!|`|8WRnqs08aa	Take a HPT right away.    My last pregnancy was a twin pregnancy. I had spotting up through the 16 th week. At my 19 week ultrasound, I was informed of the twin pregnancy, but that one twin had demised. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl June 2008.    I have a friend who was pregnant with twins. She miscarried and was scheduled for a D & C. Just before the procedure, she had an ultrasound that revealed the viable twin. She gave birth to a healthy single baby.    My sister continued to have heavy menstrual periods for the first three months of her first pregnancy. She didn't realize that she was almost 4 months pregnant until she got suspicious of her weight gain.    Take a test & if positive seek prenatal care immediately! Best Wishes!|`|htSZsds7aa	You may have miscarried, but not all came out and u could have an infection. Get to the doc ASAP.on ideas about what to do...dont have sex until u are married. Problem solved.|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	Okay, first of all pregnant women DO NOT get their periods. What some women experience is implantation bleeding, which is very light, sporadic around the time they might expect their normal period which can last up to 3 days but usually only lasts a day and hardly makes it to their panty liner; it's usually only visible when wiping, and it only happens once during the pregnancy because implantation only happens once. Some women do spot during pregnancy, however, it is not heavy bleeding like a period and it is NOT a period.    That being said, having a regular period with regular bleeding, on regular days and regular in length is pretty much your body's way of saying that it's not pregnant.    What you're describing from your previous experience with what you thought was a miscarriage actually sounds like a painful period. If you had a miscarriage, the bleeding would have kept going at least two weeks, and the symptoms would not have gone away immediately after--they would have slowly subsided as the hormone left your system.    What made you think you were pregnant in the first place? You're saying you cannot buy a pregnancy test now, so I'm wondering how you found out you were pregnant.    The only thing you can do is to take another test. From what you're describing it doesn't sound like you're pregnant at all; and the people around you don't seem to be very educated on this topic either, so I would suggest either seeing a gynecologist, or finding a family planning clinic and talking to someone who can actually help you understand what may be going on with your body; they can also give you a pregnancy test there without your parents knowing. Look it up over the internet--they usually have numbers you can call and find the nearest clinic.    Good luck.|`|YfRNYppSaa	Just probably have hormone levels that are out of balance causing the changes.  Your GH might be getting high, or your body could be developing into a fuller adult, every male and female goes through the changes for a long time not just up to certain ages.  In my opinion, you are probably becoming a full female,but I would at least check with a doctor, even if you do not want to, safety always comes first.|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	yep it's possible|`|NYZ8ebD6aa	It could jsut be one of those things, i mean with me, i have times where i will feel sick like 3 weeks straight, nauseated, weight gain, cravings all the time..  I would suggest going to get a test but as you say you cant,,     otherwise i would say be straight up with whatever parent you feel more comfortable with and telling them the truth about how ur feeling, and tht u have had ur period but u dont know about the craving.|`|rLqo6ACkaa	i would say you are pregnant but bleeding while you are ive ,never heard of thatt but i think you could be if its rare it can still happen ...    maybe you had 2 eggs but only one of them got fertilized so you period is getting rid of itt ??    just a thought      hope i helped    please email if you find out you are because i realy want to know if its possible heres my email ... rchlcheeka@yahoo.com|`|qnMRtQ3vaa	First of all how old are you? Now i would personally say to go to the doctors.If you don't want your parents to find out then you can tell them that you are going to a friends house and then you and that friend can go to the doctors together. So that's all ive got.I would just figure out some way to get to the doctors before it`s to late and your parents find out.
VUfT35UQaa	Aww! That is so sweet! My mum used to do that for me when I was younger and it was so fun! Now we just go on a road trip to the country side the week before easter to this cute little chocolate shop and she buys me  chocolate duck (well, they have eggs and bunnies, but the ducks are cuter lol)    Here are a few:    When it rains and we go out, we need one first... (the umbrella stand or coat closet)    When you want to type a letter, where do you go? (under the mousepad or behind the monitor)    When you go in here, you get clean but wet (the bath tub)    It can get hot in here, so don't melt the eggs by turning it on (the oven)    If you stare too long, you'll start to feel dizzy but it makes your clothes warm and cozy (dryer or washing machine)    When you put on your shoes you need to put these on first (in the sock drawer)    If you're thirsty for some water you need to put it in a... (put the clue and eggs in a tumbler/glass)    If you want to draw a picture you need these (next to some crayons)    When there is nothing to do and it is rainy outside you can watch this (behind the TV)    If you have a garden and it has some plants in it you can hide something in there with the clue 'The easter bunny likes to play here with the lady bugs and butterflies'    My mum always left the easter egg with a bowl of carrots and said the easter bunny didn't want me to be unhealthy so I should have a healthy snack first - it never worked, I always went straight for the egg lol!|`|gP0gYbBaaa	i cant think of riddles.  but i did that for my cousins and sister one year.  i hid them in the fridge, microwave, by the tv, computer, radio, and other random places.|`|s247INgBaa	Aw what a cute idea! That's sweet of you!    You could do something like "you sit on this..." and tape and egg to the bottom of a chair.    Um I will edit back when I think of more haha.    EDIT -     "You carry this..." and hide some in a bag    "You eat off this..." and put some on a plate in a cupboard    "You get real eggs from here..." and put them in an egg carton|`|1VdgsZPoaa	*You keep the real eggs here*  Then hide them in place of real eggs in the egg container. [That girl above me just totally took my idea, anyways whatever].    If you have a pet one could be *This place is where [name of pet sleeps and/or lives* and put it in the animals cage or under the animals bed.    *This smells pretty* and hide them in a flower pot.    *You get clean in this* and hide them in the bath tub.    *You read these* and hide them on a book shelf.|`|L1Hvwi5Yaa	We clean our dishes here for the sink.    Go to the place where daddy/mommy loves to sit. then you could put them in your favorite place to sit.    Go to the place where clothes get dry.

SEzIkGNiaa	Child Care|`|J4W68owgaa	I'm in the same boat.    I'm getting my certification for my CNA and am planning on just working  few hours a night while my husband stays home with the kids.    I did do housecleaning for awhile, which worked well because I brought my little ones with me. Otherwise, you could look into working at a daycare center, although they don't pay much.    Another option is to see about getting a medical transcription degree and try to do some work from home, but those jobs get taken really quickly.    Good luck hun.|`|WwCBomTMaa	Photography, child care, E-Bay, party planning, selling candles....hun there are a million different things that you could do. However, steer clear of the work from home jobs on the internet. Most are frauds, unless you have been offered a job by a familiar company for a stay at home position. Try www.westemployment.com. They are a customer service company that has clients like AT&T and Toys R Us. But they have work from home jobs, and some might be available in your area.

My day was and is CRAZY. I saw my husband and 6-month-old off to the airport for their trip early this morning, went into work for a little while, and have since been packing for our flight EARLY tomorrow (I'm not sleeping, no use - have to be on the road at 3:15AM) and my kids are going crazy excited for a vacation, so we've literally gotten no schoolwork done today.    My kids keep "needing" something out of their luggage, so they dig through it and try to repack it, then of course nothing fits any more, so I have to do it over. I think they're doing it on purpose now, just to get a rise from me.    I've diverted them temporarily by telling them to make snacks for our trip: thank whatever-god-you-want-me-to for Easy Bake Ovens. *phew*|`|s247INgBaa	That's good! :)    My day has only just started (8:30am, Australia).

Avoiding surgery, no scar. You can bond with baby asap.<br>  Cons, well, the only real thing I can think of was I had bad tearing down there, which took a bit to heal. Quite painful for a while there!<br>  <br>  Pro's to a c-section, well, there arent many! Yes, it is quick, and convenient if it is elective.<br>  Cons: Recovery is long and painful, you can't drive, bend, do housework, tend to baby properly. Not to mention the lovely scar they leave!<br>  My mum had a natural, followed by 2 c-sections.<br>  <br>  I would much rather another natural delivery for sure, however I already know that my #4 will be another caesarian, due to the fact that I have now had 2.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	with a vaginal birth, you have the pain during labor. with a c-section, you have the pain after labor. i personally had 2 vaginal births. my best friend had a c/s and was in alot of pain afterwords. my mother had one of each and her abdominal muscles split perminatly. now when she does a sit up or somethin, you can see her muscles split and pook funny.i personally am all for the vaginal birth unless of course there is a very real need for a c/s. good luck on yoru decision.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	my mom had 5 kids and did a natural birth for all of us, no complications. (my mom is tiney too, right at 5 feet tall, no more than 110 lbs). i had a natural birth with my first and hope to do that with this one. i think some women want a c section because they think it will hurt less, but its not true. you risk  infection, you cant lift much for weeks, its a lot harder for much longer. as with a vaginal birth, you can go home that same day and go back to your daily routine if you feel up to it! recovery is much easier with vaginal. <br>  <br>  and plus, most doctors will only do a c section if medically necesarry, but to be honest thats my greatest fear!! scary, not to mention SPENDY!|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	i generally know about c-section.. <br>  c-section is the safest as the cord cant get wrapped around the child's head or anything.. me or my mother was gion to die if we didnt have c-section.. <br>  c-section takes longer to heal as they have cut your belly open and you have a permanent scare..|`|AA11182621	It is better to have a natural birth, rather than any surgical intervention.<br>  <br>  1. It is better for you and the baby<br>  2. Later bonding between you and baby is so much stronger<br>  3..

They sound harder to recover from since it is an operation to remove the baby safely. <br>  I had 3 vaginal births. My oldest daughter had 2 vaginal births. Im up late tonight as my youngest is having a baby as  I type so I dont know what the outcome was or will be for her..<br>  My mom had 2 vaginal births. Noone in my familly ever had a c section. Its nothing to stress over though, many women have them, and none of my friends that have had them had any problems associated from them. You basically just take it easy while sitting up and getting up, and do way less around the house a little longer so that you heal up.
5DJcir9saa	Don't worry! I was the same way.  I had heard so many horror stories about pregnancy and child birth but its not that bad!  You'll just deal with it as it comes.  Believe me, by time you're in labor, you won't be scared, you'll just want that baby out!!!!   And it is all so worth it in the end.    As far as being scared around other babies, I was the same way too!  Even while I was pregnant, my cousin had a baby and just assumed I'd want to be all about it, but I didn't even offer to hold her.  Holding someone else's baby is scary...but when its your own it come extremely natural.  So just don't worry about it.  This might sound cliche but your instincts will kick in =)|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I was just like you...not the being pregnant part though, but about babies.  I never babysat any kids younger then 7 when I was younger...and I am an only child so I had no experience there either.  The very first diaper I ever changed was my sons.   When I found out I was pregnant I was a little scared.  And a friend at work had a baby and she would encourage me to hold him and feed him, saying I needed the practice.  I held her son, and I was really uncomfortable.  I didn't know what to say to him...how to hold him or anything that I thought a mother should know.  When my son was born I held him and I was still uncomfortable but because he was so small.  I had a c section and the meds made me ill(vomiting and such) and dizzy...so my SIL held him for most of the first couple hours.  After I was feeling better I held him and changed him and fed him and it really did seem more natural to me.    Don't worry, lots of women have these thoughts, and go through the exact thing you are.  It will come natural to you once you see your own baby.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Lol, my husband had your problem, well part of it. He was terrified of holding babies. He was scared he would break it or drop it. He didn't hold any of our friends kids until after I was pregnant. We had a close friend have a baby 3 months before me and he held his first newborn that day. He did great and has been great with our son. It didn't just come naturally, he learned. Having a connection with your baby isn't always instant either and that's ok. I didn't feel connected with my son for months. He is mine and I love him but I didn't have that "in love" feeling for a long time. It does develop eventually but don't feel bad if it's not instant, it's there whether you feel it or not. There is nothing about child birth that is scary. Our bodies were made to do it. Generations of women before us did it, most without drugs, and obviously survived. Childbirth is like ripping off a band aid. You don't want to do it because you know it will hurt but in the end the pain doesn't last forever and it has to be done. Remember that childbirth has an end, it can't last forever.|`|r5R2nstRaa	its okay! once you have your own, things come natural. if you'd like you can take parenting classes, birthing classes. there are so many helpful things out there for mothers to be. im sure you should have something in your community. just ask around or look it up. doctor's office usally have things posted for that nature, good luck, and im sure you will be okay.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	It is completely different when you have a child of your own. Before I had my son I didn't even like kids. Now my son means the world to me and I want nothing more than to spend all my time with him. Whether it be playing on the floor with him or watching cartoons with him. I've actually found myself loving all kids. It completely changes you as a person. Trust me!|`|HF97Rs9qaa	You are probably scared of them because they are fragile and the thought of being responsible for another human being for the rest of your life can be scary. It is a life long commitment for you and being a parent is a HUGE responsibility. Not something to take lightly or just jump or rush in to if you are truly not ready.    If you have such anxiety over it then I highly suggest getting over that anxiety first. See a therapist, or talk to other mothers, read books, do reasearch, etc...    What you describe could cause you to have post partum depression after your baby is born and maybe even depression during the pregnancy. In some cases it can be so bad that a mother will not want anything to do with her baby or also want to hurt or kill the baby. My sister sounded a lot like you and went through it with all 3 of her children and it was hard for her and her kids and still is. Her kids are not doing well and have been taken from her several times.     Only you truly know yourself and what you want and can handle and are ready for. Do not feel you must have kids because you are a woman or because your husband will want kids or your biological clock is ticking.     From what you describe you seem to know that at this point you are just not ready yet. And that it totally okay and there is nothing wrong with you for feeling that way. Some people know they were never meant for parenting and that is okay, some people were born for it and are naturals. And some others must work extra hard and always doubt themselves and struggle but through hard work they make wonderful parents.    You can't see in to the future and know what may or may not happen, you can only try to prepare yourself as best you can and make reasonable, responsible decisions.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	WOW! You have lots of company.    I was going to say that being around babies, and holding them would help. After the first few times, you'd learn to relax.    But those who felt as you are pointing out the power of hormones -- they kick in, and it changes your brain.    Still, consider visiting someone who has a baby (maybe start with older babies), and be with, and then hold them.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	it is way different when it's you own baby...I have 2 little girls and even when I hold someone else's baby is is kinda uncomfortable...as for giving birth it doesn't last forever and they can give you drugs for the pain...you do learn what to do with a baby...|`|nnKtP60Oaa	it's very different when you have ur own baby! i agree! still scary..but it will become natural to you. i used 2 be scared of the thought of pregnancy!!!!!!!!! and holding babies! ah! but now i lug around my kid everywhere|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	OK my GF is scared of delievery after seeing mine.. LOL I turned in to a physco Btch and was in pain.. but they have meds and once its over its not bad.. I had to have an ER C section cause my son was coming down with his head all twisted.. LOL i was in pain but it is a different pain. Its like getting a tattoo you really want and you cant wait for it to be done to see what has been created.. NOW most 90% of pregnancies are not bad there is a lil pain but nothing more then bad cramps. If you are so scared of kids go to a friends kid and help her take care of it. TRUST ME your opinion changes when you have YOUR child I use to think WHY talk to a baby and BABY talk was weird.. NOW I sit and baby talk and talk to my son all day long.. LOL he is prob tired of hearing me talk.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Its way different with your own baby, and I never thought that was true until I had my son... it just kinda clicked and I wasn't scared to handle him or care for him in the least bit. Trust me you will get the mothers instinct and it will all come to you... I was the same way before I had my son, and I still get nervous holding small babies, even though I had one myself. Don't be scared it's truly the best feeling in the world to be a mommy. It really is different when it's your own.|`|PfmaMnmpaa	You will be fine with your own kids because they are your's.  They are a part of you.  I have 2 kids and I love them to death.  But I still too feel uncomfortable holding someone elses baby.  It is just different when it is your own.    As for being pregnant...it is a scary thing because you don't always know what to expect.  But it is a great feeling knowing that there is a human being growing inside of you. And when you do have the baby it seems like all your fears go away!!!|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	It sounds like you just aren't ready to have kids yet and there is nothing wrong with that. No one says you have to have a baby right after you get married. Just enjoy being young and spending time with your honey!  As for having a baby it is scary at first only because you don't know what to expect. I was scared to death when I found out I was pregnant, but I just talked to my doctor and got a few pregnancy books 'What To  Expect When You're Expecting' is a great one. Then when it came time to deliver I just did it. Luckily I had an epidural/spinal block &  lots of drugs so I didn't feel a thing until later. And the nurses in the hospital will answer questions and show you everything from how to swaddle and hold a baby to changing diapers and bathing. Just don't be afraid to ask!  Now my babies are 10 months old and doing great & I love them more than anything! Hope this helps.|`|y2cBSs0eaa	My daughter Harleigh is barely 4 weeks old. She's my first child, and to be honest, I'm still scared. Before her I wasn't around many babies, so safe to say I was pretty nervous around them. Just relax. Being a mother is something you have to get used to. And word of advice...DO NOT watch programs on child birth! I was totally freaked out about it. Just read books about children and ask questions to women who have children. Good luck and God bless!

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I'm not sure you realize how lucky you are.  He takes a 3-hour nap and then only wakes once in 11 hours?  That's pretty good for a 2-month-old.      Honestly, their sleep patterns change a lot in the first 6 months, so if you just continue to follow his cues as to when he's tired, his pattern will probably change on its own soon enough.      My kids were all still taking 3 (short) naps per day at that age, dropped to two naps around 6-9 months, and dropped to one nap between 12-18 months.  My 17-month-old is currently trying to drop down to just one nap per day, but he's not quite there yet, so we're having some wacky sleep patterns now, too, and he's completely unpredictable.    If you really want him to go to bed earlier at night, you could try waking him before 9am.  Then his naps would probably be earlier, along with his bedtime.  Just be aware that you're taking the chance that he may start waking more at night if you mess with his daytime sleep.    Congrats on your baby, and good luck!|`|3CG3rby0aa	just wait until he is about 4 months old and then try scheduling him.  try your best to work with him now.  good luck.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	just let him sleep when he feels like it. He's a baby and it doesn't matter if you keep him awake, he's going to settle into his own sleeping schedule anyway. My son is two months old and he sleeps when he wants to. It goes with being a mother to an infant, you have to adjust to their schedule for now, not the other way around.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Just let him sleep when he is tired. In another month or two he will have his own sleep patterns and you can try to adjust it then.|`|Y8rQQKuVaa	At 2 months, he still hasn't really matured in terms of set sleep cycles. His circadiannrhythmsms are still developing. I'd be ecstatic that he's only waking 1 time a night!     Over the next few months, he should regulate himself a little more. Don't force him to be awake at this point, but you might try starting consistent routines (if you haven't already). Have a nighttime routine and a nap time routine that helps him regulate his schedule.    My son is 4 months and still struggles with nap times and still wakes once a night to eat.

Do you know what meth addicts are like? Now let's take me for example: I have been and on again/off again heroin addict for 7 1/2 years. I am 29 years old. I go to the gym every day. I have a nice body (not ripped, but chicks definately LOOK). I have nice teeth. I brush every day and I go to the dentist. I take a shower at LEAST once a day. I do alot of cardio and weight training, and when I put on my swimsuit and walk out into the pool area at the gym, I don't have open sores and blisters all over me because I'm NOT ADDICTED TO METH. My teeth aren't black and falling out, I'm not moving a mile-a-minute, and I don't jones for heroin because I see a doctor whom prescribes buprenorphine for me (a substitute), and I sleep at night because I also get Xanax). I am an addict, but if you looked at me, you'd never, ever know it, because I act normal, and I look normal. I do attend group meetings once in awhile (just to remind myself that I AM AN ADDICT), and I take care of myself. I look good, I feel good, and I'm clean. I'm sorry about the meth problem. I really am, but Meth addicts aren't able to keep themselves taken care of, cleaned up, and they have open sores on their bodies and their teeth EVENTUALLY DO TURN BLACK AND FALL OUT. How do I know? Well, Meth was normally associated with the midwestern states like Iowa and Nebraska (this is where I'm from originally), but I never ran into it until I moved to rural Oregon. Way up in the Northwest corner, right on the coast. I thought I'd take a year or two (turned out to only be 9 months because my job dissappeared) and just live on the coast. I had a nice house I rented 2 blocks from the beach. I was surrounded by beautiful mountains, and the entire town was filled with Meth Addicts. The whole entire police force had to spend every waking minute arresting them for breaking into people's houses and cars to steal things to pawn so they could get more meth. One time I went to the public housing to buy some xanax from this chick becuase my stepfather had just died and I was I really having a hard time. The whole place was crawling with meth addicts. It was SO SAD. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, SO (SINCE I WAS DRIVING TRUCK AT THE TIME I WAITED UNTIL I SAW TODD ANDERSON, OUR SHERIIFF, AND I got on the radio and told him that I wanted to talk to him in person and where could we do it. He told me to meet him by the courthouse and I did. We discussed my heroin addiction (I was clean at the time, versus meth addiction, and how it was ruining this picturesque little town on the Oregon Coast (I refrain from giving you the name of the town). I told him about my trip over to the public housing (said I was just going to visit a friend, and he told me that they have, on average, one person PER MONTH DIE THERE because of their meth addiction. So there I am with my Semi parked, talking to the Sheriff about how methampetamine addiction is ruining an absolutely beautiful little town of 4,500 RIGHT on the Pacific Ocean in Oregon. Now if Meth can do THAT, do you really think that you want to get mixed up with a guy who is addicted to this stuff? I'll let YOU make the decision. I hope you make the right one. I'm not some bible-thumping anti-drug crusader. But THAT stuff, is VERY, VERY dangerous. And yes, I would say it is WORST THAN HEROIN. And believe me, I've had my bouts with heroin. It's been a tough battle, but I'm still clean. I'm not much on religion, but I thank the state of Oregon, the state of Iowa, and the funding from the State of Illinois for helping to keep me clean. Also, my parents (thank god they're both still with us), and my own hard-core will. Addiction is a horrible, horrible thing, and once you're caught up in it, it's FOR LIFE. IT IS FOREVER. You will fight it 'til the day you die. -john in rock island, illinois, QUAD CITIES, USA
8bVyYeMyaa	just let her she is growing up and wants to experience new things if you don't let her then she will do it behind your back|`|ChotK6R9aa	Let her. I've been wearing tampons since the age of 9, but have only worn a thong once. She'll wear one maybe 6 or 7 times, realise how uncomfortable they are and leave it at the back of the drawer!<br>  <br>  Make sure you discuss both the risks of tampons and thongs:<br>  Tampons: TSS, discomfort etc.<br>  Thongs: infections, haemorrhoids....<br>  <br>  I'm a great believer in letting kids try things they want to (within reason obviously!). If she persists in wearing a thong, get her to start horseback riding or other activity where wearing a thong becomes uncomfortable - she'll probably change back of her own accord :)|`|SHQHnKfcaa	To be honest with you she will probably use them anyway from friends or buy them herself.<br>  <br>  When I was almost 12 I used one and used another one without removing the first one.<br>  <br>  I just forgot because you know I was young and my mother didn't explain it because she didn't want me to use them either.<br>  <br>  Well, The end of the hole thing of not remembering to remove the tampon I ended up really sick with TSS.<br>  <br>  My body went into a shock and got so sick to were I couldn't tell you now.<br>  <br>  The best advice would be that you could explain to her the dangers of using them and tell her your not suppling them.<br>  <br>  The thong issue is something that for her age she shouldn't be wanting to wear thongs.<br>  <br>  Thongs are for adault women with mature minds, might want to ask were she got the idea to wear thongs and see if you can't tell her shes to young for them.|`|xeVfE97Caa	I would probably let her use tampons. That is more of a functionality issue. Pads are uncomfortable and you feel like everyone knows you are wearing one. Say no to thongs. It would concern me if my daughter asked to wear thongs. I know girls like to have cute underwear for sleep overs but I can't imagine her wearing a thong to empress her girl friends so you have to ask yourself if she is trying to empress a boy. Maybe it is time to have the talk. If you have already had the talk, then discuss the thong issue with her. Ask her what it is that she likes about thongs, why she wants to wear them, and if it is for a boy, talk about sex again just to make sure that your sound influence is in there. I am sure it will be an uncomfortable conversation for the both of you, but it wont be as uncomfortable as the conversation you would have if she came home pregnant.|`|VGhmc0dOaa	Tampon= yes, what's the problem?<br>  <br>  Thongs...<br>  When I was 13 I went through a stage of wanting to wear thongs, and the only reason was because all my friends were starting to wear them. But I was too scared to ask my mum for them in case she told me I was too young, so I bought them in secret. Anyway, I hated them, they were so uncomfy. But I still wore them on the days we had gym so I wasn't left out in the changing room. Anyway, as for the thong issue with her maybe you should just ask her why she wants them?- I suspect she just wants to fit in with her friends, or maybe its because she hates VPLs or you just buy them for her and let her decide for herself. Thongs don't have to be slutty. You could just buy her some 'thicker' less revealing plain ones.|`|BNCpLcLoaa	I know its seems horrible but chances are that her friends are all doing it and she feels left out. Maybe you could meet her half way and let her have them but don't let her wear them for school?<br>  <br>  Using a tampon rather than a pad may just be a security thing, maybe she is worried about leaking in public?<br>  <br>  Having said that, I don't think I would be happy with my daughter wearing a thong...<br>  <br>  Maybe agree to the tampons if she is willing to hold off on the thong??<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|9ZWcHnlJaa	Using tampons isnt really a big deal, they're a lot more comfortable than pads. <br>  When you play sports, pads make it really uncomfortable to run or skate or whatever.<br>  So i think you should let her use tampons if she wants.<br>  <br>  But a thong? She's 13 years old, who's going to be seeing her without pants on anyway? Plus, MAJOR wedgies result from them :S<br>  No 13 year old girl should be wearing a thong.|`|IOE020qYaa	Im 13 too.

Tampons though are a matter ot preference and feeling clean... I hate wearing pads and only use tampons....I have since 14 or so....that is when I first wanted to try.<br>  <br>  Edit: while wearing a thong may not make her go out and have sex her peers wll be able to tell she's wearing a thong and that will make boys think that she'd be open to things she shouldn't be doing...thongs WILL show off her butt, and she doesn't need to be displaying that at this young and tender age.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i was 8 when i got my first thong, it felt awful and i threw it away the next day lol, i started to use tampons when i was about 12 as i was going swimming with my school, after that i wore them all the time, they are much easier and more hygenic, let your daughter try new things, you will most likely find she wont want to wear the thong and will try again in a few years, and as for the tampons they are much better than pads, aslong as she wears a pad at night|`|A3zAXntxaa	ALERT THE MEDIA!<br>  <br>  It's just underwear and tampons.<br>  Big whoop.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hopefully she's not having sex and doing drugs.<br>  Good luck.|`|5oGdBwh5aa	I think you should let her. Tampons are so much better than pads. And as long as you raised her right then her wearing a thong shouldn't be a problem either. You raised her now its time to try some trust maybe?|`|o4IcmkwLaa	Let her. Why is that a problem?|`|NYU37jfGaa	She is definitely too young to wear a thong.  Discourage her from doing this. She shouldn't be dressing like a tart at her age.  As for pads or tampons, I think that is really up to her, though personally I think tampons are quite revolting.  I always found them very uncomfortable, and that string hanging out of you is disgusting, it looks like you've got a dead mouse stuffed up your vagina. But it's a very personal thing, and a lot of people prefer them for some reason.|`|O8XjkCjxaa	I don't see what's wrong with her wearing tampons; as long as she knows to change them regularly and she knows about Toxic Shock Syndrome. Also, if people keep putting of using tampons, they get kinda scared about it. I have a friend who's 19 and still can't use them.<br>  <br>  Thongs on the other hand...they're a bit iffy for a 13 year old. Let her know that you can get thrush and UTIs from wearing thongs and that they're very uncleanly. Also tell her that you think she's too young to be wearing them.<br>  <br>  I went through a phase where I wanted to wear thongs, it was when I was about 13 too I think, but I soon grew out of it when I realised how unpractical and uncomfortable they are.|`|8jBGhsWPaa	Let her, whats wrong with wearing tampons and thongs? I got my first thong at 13 I dont see what the problem is. Maybe she wants to feel more grown up because all the girls at school wear them or she knows you might own some and feels out of place. Its all part of growing up, maybe she doesnt feel comfortable in pads they might make her itch. Tampons are alot cleaner and easier to use. I think you should allow her to do both its when she starts asking for a nurse outfit you should worry.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	She is way too young to be wearing a thong.  Unless she is trying to prostitute herself.  Which absolutely and, unequivocally, NOT your fault.<br>  <br>  She is trying to grow up, way too fast.<br>  <br>  Put the breaks on that behavior, before she regrets it.<br>  <br>  As for the tampons/pads part, I can't answer that.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	My 14 year old daughter started out with pads but they are a bit messy so she just asked me if I'd buy her some tampax so I did. She wears thongs too.

There is probably some sort of peer pressure thing going on. Just get her some cool boyleg type things. They're way comfier and a bit more age appropriate. Or you could get her a really creepy one from a second hand store to put her off. Thongs at that age won't be helpful.<br>  <br>  With the tampons. Make sure you find out why she wants to use them. If its insecurity, uncomfortableness or easy use type thing let her use them but warn her and everything. If its a whole "trying to mature quickly and make sure my friends know it" type thing. Don't let her. There is seriously no point in being something you aren't.<br>  <br>  Plus. It's your daughter, do what you thinks right.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|FiUprYsvaa	I would let her use tampons. <br>  That one I wouldn't put restrictions on, that is such a personal choice it should NEVER be decided by someone else. <br>  My mom wouldn't let me wear tampons till I started swimming in 8th grade. I hated pads and still do with as much hate as I can have. They are so uncomforatable and not to be graphic but they are messy.<br>  <br>  As for the thong. Well, that one can be up to you. <br>  Maybe no to the thong and hell yes to the tampons.|`|b222bbf9d5984acf8e16e6e1f1693854aa	I'm 15 years old and I defiantly think you should let her wear tampons. I was so nervous to use then up until a few months ago when I had to for swim team. If she feels ready then I think it is a great idea for her, but please make her aware of TSS. As for the thong I do not think that would be a good idea. Thongs are more of a sexual thing so I don't think it would be appropriate.|`|keEwsjxYaa	well it's her choice really, but this could be down to peer pressure -at least the thong thing.. At 13 i didn't wear thongs, not at the start anyway but I had been wearing tampons since my last months of being a 11 year old because frankly they are way easier to use than pads. You might wanna talk to her about the thongs .. that it isn't the right age yet but I think if she wants to use tampons, she should be allowed to. After all, it depends on how comfortable she is.<br>  hopethiishelps x|`|1jwbQaZTaa	tampons are much more sanitary and discreet than  pads. <br>  <br>  and wearing a thong doesnt mean shes going to be having sex or showing anyone. if it makes you feel better, make her wear one that says "i love my mom"<br>  <br>  i got my first thong in 7th grade because i was insecure about panty lines. no boy ever saw my underwear till jr year of high school. but remember, if you say no no no no no, shes gonna buy one behind your back and change into it at school. just be helpful, keep an open mind, its just underwear.|`|2ZXh00C5aa	Let her use tampons; pads are absolutely disgusting. <br>  <br>  <br>  While wearing a pad, you can't engage in a lot of sports and it's incredibly messy! <br>  <br>  <br>  As for the thongs, I can't answer that for you.<br>  It's ultimately YOUR decision.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	my is 12 and does both, its what everyone is doing, i would be useing tampons but i have only started last month, and i darent buy a thong if she wants to act grown up let her|`|bYU77eteaa	dont buy her thongs and throw away the ones she gets for herself when you see them<br>  Let her wear tampons...I wear tampons because I dont like how much of a mess pads leave.

I suffered depression when I was pregnant with my first. I ended up talking to my GP about it and got some help. I also told my partner how I was feeling and apologised in advance at how I might act. Don't be afraid to admit you need help ok? Try to ease of your fiance...

Good luck!! xx|`|PxqcLkw1aa	It sounds like this guy is bending over  backwards to make you happy. Cut him some slack. Maybe you should ask yourself if you are unhappy being with him or unhappy with yourself.You absolutely have control over your actions so their should be no excuses.

wggSgOMBaa	Gosh, that sounds like a lot to deal with! It's good that you're looking for help. Many parents with children your son's age feel the same overwhelming feelings as you are experiencing. Having depression is a clinical situation that your doctor can help you with. I've been on nortryptiline (sp?) for two months and LOVE it. Paxil was a good choice for me too. Please, please reach out to a helpline if you're really at the breaking point. There's no reason you can't lock the doors of the house, and lock yourself in the bathroom for five minutes if you are at the end of your rope. It'll be the best for you and your son. I love Time Out (and never back down!) for discipline. Spanking out of anger makes things WORSE. Tell your son calmly what he did wrong, why he is going to time out, and hold  the door shut for five minutes if you must, then when it's over explain that he's been punished for (fill in the blank) and that he mustn't do it again or he will go to time out. Don't threaten time out unless you WILL FOLLOW THROUGH. You can say, "Jimmy, if you don't stop screaming I'm putting you in time out" and if he stops, then go about your business, if he won't, put him in time out. Never longer than five minutes. It's an eternity for youngsters. Also, REWARD good behavior.If he does what you want, and/or is acting really good, say "Mommy is so happy you are being so good right now. Let me give you a hug and read you a story". He will respond well to your feelings, and also poorly to your bad ones. That said, please, please talk to a doctor about your feelings of depression. Even walk-in clinics will usually write you a script for a mild anti-depressant if you're uninsured (especially so). There is nothing wrong with getting yourself leveled off while tackling one of the world's toughest jobs....MOM. Good luck hon!|`|L2tUuclvaa	Sounds pretty normal to me, boys are like wild animals. Mcdonalds free playground is a must you can relax and just watch him play, no sugars or caffeine at all and if you live in a house just open the back door and get him some tonka trucks tell him to dig a whole to china... worked on me. Oh and insurance is a must he is going to hurt himself a lot I have scars to prove it there is no stopping it you will go mad trying to stop the inevitable. Don't let it get to you only another year and it will be channeled through the sports activities. Good luck... Oh and the best tip of all, when he gets hurt don't freak stay calm and tell him to "shake it off" and do the motion with him. It is amusing and it works like a charm to stop the crying.|`|fd1158203ed0f806a92cca5f555a650daa	I have been there myself. I also have a 4 years old little girl she is the same way. I had her tested and nothing. She is fine. It is their age and they will grow out of it. The number one thing is you have to have a time out, that time will help you with the stress and from that you will be a better mother. The next thing you should do that really helped me was make things  fun, like who can get dressed first and who can win to the car. I feed into her energy and that has helped so much. Before I would be yelling all the time "GET DRESSED or GET IN THE ******* CAR"They will out grow this and calm down but you really do need to take a brake. Go for a walk with or with out your son if you have someone to take care of him for a bit. Just remember soon he will be all grown up and you want him to remember the love you have had for him and not you yelling to stop or shut up all the time. Best of luck
WSXDQ4bpaa	They can be symptoms of pregnancy, but it is far too early for some of them. My nipples did not darken until 12-14 weeks pregnant.

One thing I was told when I got pregnant with my son was you can have a false negative but you cannot have a false positive. I took the test a week late, and it was negative. I took it again three days later, and it was positive.<br>  <br>  I didn't start having morning sickness until 7 weeks along, but I heard it is possible to have symptoms sooner. <br>  <br>  It is also possible, and I hate to say this but you should know, that the symptoms might be psychosomatic. When I got pregnant I was obsessed with symptoms. The biggest thing for me? About two weeks before I took the test my appetite grew so huge i had seven pieces of pizza and was still hungry! So...Maybe<br>  <br>  For your sake, I hope you are. ^_^|`|ZRZEL5SEaa	I just found out I'm pregnant, these were my symptoms:<br>  <br>  Wicked heartburn around the time i conceived ( a few days after sex)<br>  nausea when I was hungry<br>  upset tummy (Ie- running to the loo)<br>  weird muscle pains & pangs in odd places I don't normally get.|`|cQq9vTTraa	all this symptoms are of pregnancy.but confirm it by test.all the best.|`|C6ymnSWoaa	You should also try for a marriage, too.
t4x3aiFOaa	Sorry!! I was told that babies sometimes change their sleep pattern and do not sleep through the night for no reason at all. I have an 11 month old and over time she has gone through the cycle of sleeping through the night then waking up in the middle of the night at least 3 times. <br>  Its works best for my daughter if I do not let her take a nap within 5 hours of going to bed. Her last nap is around 3 and I put her down around 8. I give her formula before bed so she doesn't get hungry and I change her diaper right before I tuck her in. Maybe you baby is waking up because he/she wants to eat or snack? Maybe their nap/wake up times need to be adjusted a little?<br>  I moved into a small apartment recently and she can hear everything so I bought a small boom box and a kids music cd for her room. I put her to bed and play the cd so she has background noise to drown out the noise I'm making or the tv in other parts of the apt. Maybe your child hears you moving around or the tv or just needs something to help him/her drift off to sleep.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My son is 12 months and recently been going through this. He woke up at 2 when my husband got home from work, my husband woke me up at 4 since he has to work tomorrow, he didn't go back to sleep till 6:30, its now 7:30 and he's up for the day.<br>  <br>  Its going to be an extremely long day.|`|RdprMxoUaa	This may sound obvious but have you tried feeding him and putting him back to bed? <br>  Babies often create their own schedule despite our best efforts to make them fit into one that works for us. (My son is ready to sleep at 8pm. I have tried getting him to go to bed at 7 but he wont have a bar of it even if he has not slept for a while.) Keep being consistent with his bed time. Choose a time to put him down when he is definitely tired and stick to that time as much as possible. When he wakes during the night lay him back down and comfort him, feed him if he seems hungry, even rock him to sleep if its all that will work, just don't get him up to play. My son was waking in the night for a while too. I did all of the above to get him back to sleep. I tried not to take him out of his bedroom until it was light outside. That way he had a visual signal to tell him it was ok to wake up now. Now he sleeps from 8pm til 6am.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	let me know if you find the answer for that question, i have a 17 month old who gets up between 5 and 6:30. eats a little somethin, gets a drink, and then SOMETIMES goes back to bed. i also have messed with his bedtime, tried to ignore him, thinking he will roll back over, but no luck hes happy as a lark when he gets up and loud to boot, lol. hes been doing this for months. i'm hoping he will grow out of it soon, like you, i would love the sleep:)

Another thing you could try is buying some cough medicine that contains guaifenesin like Children's Robitussin DM and there is some other's as well. It is an expectorant it will help loosen the mucous so she can cough it up. Talk to the pharmacist about the right dosage to give her. If you are worried that it could possibly be allergies then give her some Children's Benadryl talk to the Pharmacist about the right dosage for that as well. You CAN give the cough medicine and Benadryl at the same time. But if you are concerned with giving her both of them together then talk to the Pharmacist to confirm so you can feel safe with the decision to give her both medicines. But if the cough persists then I would suggest taking her to see her Pediatrician just to be safe. I hope she feels better soon. Good luck and God Bless
bce08a13598fe0facbe65120f03742b2aa	all the ah's and angel, is this to make it easier to remember their names??|`|fiUF4cAXaa	I like the first names but I don't like the fact that they all have angel as a middle name. Only one of the babies should have the name angel.|`|ElayGlHPaa	She must be very religious or like religious sounding names.|`|lLzOBEfTaa	Noah Angel Solomon<br>  names form the bible :)|`|HNlLQZbLaa	I hate that they use angel as the middle name for all of them.<br>  <br>  I don't really like any of them.|`|3P5S69GNaa	The only name I like is Josiah.<br>  <br>  Nariyah?

JK<br>  <br>  but seriously... what that the same and double barrel middle names??<br>  <br>  the names are okay..|`|tecPZUq2aa	Whats With The Name Angel :S lol|`|7HzfgRmwaa	why couldn't they all have their own middle name?!?! :( I guess that happens when you have too many children to name! I however love the ah sound at the end of tall of the names. And they are all very nice. Most from the Bible (if not all??) I just wonder does Makai end with that ah sound?? If not - i think thats awful because he's odd man out. I don't know how to pronounce that one though.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	isaiah is okayish but the idea of sibling sharing a middles name is stupid.|`|MdSU0s8Saa	very religious<br>  why do they all have angel in them? even the boys|`|NTqokGn0aa	I like the whole religious thingg|`|lk7iaxqkaa	I don't like the fact that the have the same middle names at all, and I don't really like Angel as a name in itself.

It looks really good though.|`|4X6MwQJRaa	Not keen on it to be honest.  Personal opinion but I just dont like the look of it, think it is ugly.  Also doesnt look very comfortable either.

YuqTcSSDaa	It could be anything. It could be implantation bleeding, if you are less than a month along. It could be a misscarriage. It could be a mucus plug. That is why you should relax with your feet up until you can get to the doctor. Avoid caffiene.|`|7vCMigRnaa	How far along are you? If you're in your third trimester it sounds a little like you're losing your mucous plug, which is a prelude to labour. It could also be an excess in discharge and a little bit of a spotting which is apparently normal.<br>  <br>  If you have an internal exam of intercourse it could also be from that. That happened to me a could of times. I would call your doctor though regardless, at least for piece of mind. If you are far enough along that you have started to feel the baby move, I would also monitor that and make sure you get the adequate number of kicks.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	how far are you. it could be your mucous plug as what your describing sounds like a bloody show. this generally happens in the third trimester.<br>  <br>  if your early on in pregnancy keep an eye on the bleeding but its more than likely your sensitive down there and cervical erosion os taking place which s normal.
XOnSRoR2aa	Maybe you are suffering from Postraumatic Stress Disorder which can greatly affect your ability to sleep and your overall emotional health, and is not that uncommon with victims of sexual abuse. If so, it's not something that will be healed overnight, but there are treatments and support you can seek and with time the symptoms will lessen.<br>  <br>  For now, focus on what you can do to get a bit of sleep before Monday. Get plenty of exercise earlier in the day so that your body will be more willing to fall asleep at night. Try to exercise outdoors because our eyes absorb the sunlight and activate the pineal gland in our brain which stimulates the production of melatonin, and that will help you sleep much more soundly at night. Cut back on caffeine, and don't eat anything after 9pm at night. Do some light stretches and yoga shortly before you go to bed. Mediation and prayer is also helpful. Take a bath about an hour before you go to sleep and pour some lavendar oil in the water to help you relax. I love to light some candles and turn off the lights and hook my ipod up to some speakers. I have a playlist of chillaxing music that helps me to wind down. Read a few chapters of a book, draw or do something else that will divert your focus from the abuse earlier in the night, and whenver you start to feel haunted by what happened while you are trying to sleep focus on what you just read or drew. I know most people discourage watching TV in bed, but sometimes I'll fall asleep to a movie I've watched so many times before that I don't need to sit up and pay attention to it but can just drift off while listening to it instead of all the thoughts bouncing around my mind. If none of these techniques help, try taking an herbal supplement like Melatonin or Valerian, or a mild sleeping aid like Simply Sleep. Another answerer suggested that you take Nyquil, and though it may help her and some others, it wires other people like me. On the back of the box it says "may cause excitability, especially in children." I'm 17 and not exactly a child anymore, but it makes me bounce off the walls. I've struggled with insomnia since I was ten (not because of any form of abuse but because I have a mind that never powers down), and so I know how frustrating and exasperating it can be, and you have my sympathies. <br>  <br>  Personally I think teens deserve to be allowed to take mental health days once and while just as adults are able to do, and if you have overwhelming anxiety about going to school on Monday or are just incredibly exhausted maybe you could plead your case to your mom. If you haven't racked up that many absences and assure her that you understand that this is just a one-time deal and not something you're going to repeatedly request she may let you. <br>  <br>  Good luck! : )|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Hmmm.<br>  Tell someone?<br>  Like your mom, or your counselor, or another trusted adult.<br>  If you talk it out with someone, maybe you'll feel better.<br>  <br>  And, to get to sleep, try self-medicating.<br>  I always use NyQuil when I have too many thoughts buzzing through my head to sleep.<br>  <br>  EDiT-<br>  Is the person who did it sitting in jail?<br>  Maybe if he hasn't been punished for this, you'll feel better once he is.|`|dXDLeHNZaa	Does your school have a councillor? Maybe you should go to see them. It could help.<br>  <br>  Were you sexually abused? If so, I STRONGLY suggest you do.|`|Y16olPxlaa	Write down the thoughts on paper. Then throw them in the trash. <br>  <br>  It helped when I was terrified of fire.<br>  Don't ask. <br>  Good luck!|`|sUDmIvQ5aa	Well if someone is asking you to have sex with them then you should say no. You should go to school because it is your life that is at risk. I don't think that you will b sexualy abused at school and if you are tell a teacher. About the sleep just relax and think of happy days of your life|`|t7iOijRPaa	maybe if you explain this to your mom,she will understand<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck =/|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	just relax and focus yourself only on beautiful things|`|fx60BvtBaa	say to your mum this...i think that she will say: ok! ;D|`|bVaZ72f3aa	were u abused?<br>  or is that ur imagination?|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Talk to your union rep.

b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You chances of miscarriage should be less than 5% now that you're reached 12 weeks. <br>  And I would just count your weeks from the first day of your last period. That is what the docs do. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Once you reach about 13 weeks chances reduce greatly of having a miscarriage.  Please don't worry about this sort of thing.

I know it's hard!|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	You should be going off of whatever due date your DOCTOR gave you to date a pregnancy...

MFsuN8Doaa	Yes, they are just as accurate - all Pregnancy Tests have to conform to strict regulations. When you buy and expensive one, you are paying for the packaging and labelling - that is what puts up the cost.|`|sNv4VEM6aa	I used the cheap ones with both ppregnancy'sand they were both accurate.<br>  I think the only reason there's more expansive ones is because now they have pregnancy test which have words instead of just lines, and I tthink they're just more fancy, but i reckon they'd have to be around the same accuracy.|`|ZJKmw2nlaa	I've never used the cheap ones (like from the dollar store) but I have used the average priced ones and more expensive digital read tests. In my own personal experience, I took 4 tests (three regular and one digital) and the digital was the only one that told me I was wasn't pregnant.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I just did the cheap ones because they have to pass the same guidelines as the "name brand" ones. I tested a day before I should have gotten my period and they were all accurate!|`|zRipwNLOaa	MY DR TOLD ME THEY ALL WORK THE SAME... SOME TEST FOR LOWER LEVELS(HCG) SO "MIGHT" BE ABLE TO TELL U SOONER BUT THEY ALL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME TESTING SO THEY ARE ALL THE SAME SOME JUST CAN SOMETIMES TELL SOONER THAN OTHERS. BUT ALL CAN TELL U WITHIN 3 DAYS B4 UR MISSED PERIOD.|`|hoX7hoINaa	In my opinion NO. A friend of mine took 7 cheap $1 tests from dollar store cuz she just knew she must have been preg. When she bought the more commonly used one, it was positive.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	They're all the same.
UC9Wjjscaa	I played a c.d. of soothing ocean sounds when mine were little.  My first child actually wanted to listen to this until he was 5 to go to sleep.  It soothed him and did drown out other house hold noises. I highly recommend it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	We did when he was a newborn (Johnny Cash though usually, not Mozart.)  But I recommend white noise.  We live in a city and that works better for blocking out ambient sounds.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	He needs to get used to the noise.<br>  One day your fickle baby will get sick of Mozart, and won't be able to get to sleep because he's not used to it being so noisy.<br>  And if you play it all the time, he will get sick of it.<br>  So only play it while he falls asleep.<br>  <br>  And yes, if he gets used to the music to fall asleep and doesn't have it one night, he will not want to go to sleep without it, unless you have a very easy baby.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Doing that can cause a negative sleep association which means if it's not something he can do himself to get to or back to sleep to can become a negative. He may not be able to sleep without it, what if he goes to gramma's will you bring the Mozart with? He will need to learn how to soothe himself to sleep using things/methods he can do himself.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	We usually sing the baby a song and pat her back. Have a night light on to create a setting for sleep.  If you keep the baby in your arms to rock it to sleep it will depend on the rocking so put it in the cradle. These are some songs to the bottom in the link.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I do play music for him when it's bedtime and had for a good 3 months before we had to leave for 6 days due to no electricity from an ice storm...we didn't bring his player and my SIL had no player for us to use for him. He didn't really have any issues at bedtime though even though everything about his routine was out of whack...he did alright...but as soon as we were back home it was straight back to his old routine with his music. We only use it until the CD ends then shut it off though and sometimes shut it off early with no problems.<br>  <br>  We also use a fan all night as a white noise and that is something my SIL did have for us...so mabye that is why he did okay there.|`|MtrvRNj9aa	I think it is a fantastic idea! We do this with our newborn. He loved his mobile so we used that so much that it eventually broke. My sister had gotten him a "Pete the Dragon" Disney Globe (as a joke, because her and I loved that movie when we were younger) and now we play the music on that. It lasts just long enough usually to put him to sleep (he goes to sleep rather well). He's 8 months old now so not so newborn anymore but just be careful about getting them in the habit. My aunt and uncle did this for my little cousins (leaving a cd on repeat) and now they are 11, 9 and 7 and STILL need that to fall asleep. They won't fall asleep without it. So I would watch out for that, although I assume starting out with music in the first place is creating the same sort of habit for all of us, haha. But all in all I think it is a wonderful idea.|`|f0ZqPrtxaa	Its a good idea.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 9 days old and music has a very soothing effect on her. 3 days ago, she was crying so much (even though she was fed) and I just started playing some music from my phone. She became quiet immediately and just went off to sleep. <br>  <br>  My baby didnt require the music after that but I have some music ready if she finds it extremely difficult to go to sleep later.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Take him some magazines-Boys Life, comic books, Sports Illustrated for Kids-whatever fits his interests.  Your local book store will have a  large variety of children's magazines.<br>  <br>  A book would be a good idea as well.  You do not give an age, so I can not make any specific recommendations.  A librarian or the person in the children's department at the book store would be able to help you pick one out.<br>  <br>  Puzzles or puzzle books (crosswords, suduko, etc.).<br>  <br>  Take a board game or some cards and play with him.<br>  <br>  Gameboy, DS or similar hand held gaming device.

BTc4Qp48aa	You've really got to think of what nicknames they can get from a name. Luciana could call herself "Lucy" or ?na" but all Sapphire gets is "Sapphy" or "Sapph". Alot of kids like to have nicknames nowdays.<br>  <br>  My name is Rosetta and look at all the nicknames I have to choose from: Rose, Rosie, Rosa. <br>  <br>  I went with Rosie.<br>  My mum's name is Rosetta too and she went with Rose.|`|KOcCenrEaa	Sapphire.<br>  <br>  Please don't spell it like Sapphire.<br>  I think traditional  spelling of it is the best.<br>  <br>  Luciana reminds me of Lucian from underworld movies.<br>  I also think since your display is Ruby you should go with another gem name.|`|L2Nde54Haa	when was this baby born?  1887? pavarotti....b serious!|`|RZQHB0g8aa	I love Luciana. It sounds very pretty but it also fits a grown up woman. And there are so  many cute nickname possibilities. I like Luciana more than Sapphire. Sapphire sounds a bit hard and many people feel it's a stripper name (I don't though...). Anyway, I think Luciana sounds more feminine.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Luciana is definately a pretty name for a girl and much better than Lucy which is becoming common.<br>  <br>  I also love Sapphire but think Luciana is probably prettier sounding.|`|UZEEKKPeaa	Luciana is better. Unless you want your child to hate you.|`|hggYZSyQaa	Sapphire but how about Lucy?<br>  <br>  Try these jewel names:<br>  Ruby<br>  Sapphire(yours)<br>  Opal<br>  Crystal<br>  Diamond<br>  Tiara(not that it's a jewel)<br>  <br>  Here is some more:<br>  Zoe(my favorite!)<br>  Mia<br>  Jordan(my favorite! boy/girl)<br>  Morgan(boy/girl)|`|7vCMigRnaa	Luciana is prettier. Definitely.|`|8WbfmK5daa	luciana! It is gorgeous, very pretty.<br>  <br>  Don't particularly like the name Sapphire it is just not to my taste.<br>  <br>  Might sound nice as a middle name though :)|`|fiUF4cAXaa	I like Luciana or Lucinda.|`|LIJ6Ti4yaa	luciana is prettier and cuter|`|TqQcB2gWaa	not sapphire, luciana is ok though =)|`|D0y3MwDcaa	I dont really like either..|`|Iw4Ed5Ueaa	sapphire is the best!|`|PmC0e6e1aa	I love Luciana.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	No, I do not make assumptions.  <br>  <br>  I try to be neat and organized, and I have three children.  I have a friend with ten children (all wanted, loved and with the same father) and she is WAY more patient and organized than I am.  I think she is amazing.<br>  <br>  I would love a large family, myself, and I could care less what other people think-Only an *** makes assumptions.  For instance, my children are ages 11, 8 1/2 and (almost) 17 months.  People "assume" that the baby must have a different father.  Actually, it took us quite a while to be Blessed with her, but they all have the same father-not that it is anyone else's business.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your big, happy family!|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Well I don't think you're automatically a bad parent, but I do always have a lingering feeling of "that can't be good", because I just think it would be very chaotic.<br>  <br>  To each his own though, and I'm sure you're a wonderful parent. I just don't see anyone raising 6 children, but I'm sure you can.|`|ZBc16tOvaa	i have my sister living with me at the moment so theres 11 kids and we have to be organized yer the house gets messy but we stay on top of it and we have a dish washer and every saturday morning everyone picks a room and has to clean that so we have a big clean up once a week other then that i do most house work during the week as i prefer my kids to concentrate on home work then cleaning but they do the dishes every now and then and have to pick up after themselfs always|`|AA12245468	I think it depends a lot on the family and how mom and dad are parenting too.<br>  <br>  My first thought about families having more than 2 kids is, 'nuts', to be honest. But if a family can handle it financially and mentally, why not.<br>  as far as how do families do it?<br>  We used to have a lot of chaos with four kids more so than we do now before we started being consistent with discipline and structured routines for each kid.|`|AA11024148	yes. unfortunate, but true.<br>  some women know how to raise children; some don't.<br>  <br>  my grandparents had 32 children. i have over 200 first cousins. each of my grandparents' children had at least 7.<br>  <br>  some are well raised. some are not.<br>  but i do believe we all do the best we can....|`|AASxKRiAaa	Ha ha. There are 13 kids in my family. And we had a two bed room house for most of my life. Evey one thought we were crazy, I sympathize with you!<br>  Are house was always spick and span and my mother home schooled all of us.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i have one one year old, after an hour of her being out of bed my house looks like a tornado went through it lol so i would imagine that a house with 6 kids would be worse. u must be super organised...tips please?? lol|`|QDz0FBv1aa	It depends on the person,|`|H6QkoukSaa	I don't judge people by how many kids they have. I went to school with a family that had 10 kids, plus the two adults living in the house and a set of Grandparents. So 14 people all sharing a house.<br>  <br>  People with one kid can neglect them, people with 5 kids can neglect them, there is not set rule for that kind of thing.<br>  <br>  I agree that you need to be organised with kids. I have half the amount of children that you do and I have slack days where I seem to get nothing done and others where I am very efficient.<br>  <br>  I think it is rude of people to judge other parents. Nobody knows what their life is like except them.|`|vqBvVEmzaa	i dont mind people having a lot of kids, but what i believe is not right is when u cant support them<br>  because then u end up stealing our money to help support ur children (im not saying this is you) but 'octomom' here has tons of children, knew she was having them and now needs money from all us to help support her children which i dont think she should have had...|`|7wAdC1Enaa	Yeah, people do assume but the more kids you have the more trouble they will cause. To be honest, just reading where you said 'I have 6 kids...' made me think, teenage mother with no hope and no hope for her children who all 6 have different fathers. Im sorry....|`|mS7Pq3dIaa	someone with a lot of kids like that might not be messy but it seems they wouldn't be involved enough with each individual child. That they wouldn't have the time and would probably "feel neglected" since they're not personally noticed.|`|BtEezEM1aa	If you want many kids thats kool, it your life.<br>  My mom has 3 brothers and 3 sisters|`|f29c201fc2a29ba2d20c78d6c9cc3733aa	i dont think so.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I wouldn't assume that your new friend was remotely trying to say she thought you were trashy or neglectful.  I generally assume that most parents of any number of kids have a certain amount of chaos in their lives (and houses), though I do realize that some parents are better at keeping it at bay than others.  I'm guessing she just meant that she herself would find it hard to keep a spotless house around six kids.  So would I (spotless isn't really in our repertoire, and we only have four).  But I wouldn't have thought because you had six kids you were trashy or neglectful, and I doubt she did either ... just busy, with a lot on your plate.  Sounds like she admires you for managing so well with so much to do, and sounds like you're doing an amazing job.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	My parents have six kids too, there are 3 boys and 3 girls. we are all about a year apart! I always thought that people with large families were trashy and they were irresponsible. I guess i had never met a family as large as mine that was well put together! All of us kids had chores and things to do around the house and we were very organized. We got comments all the time on "how clean and organized" we all were. And just like you said we always had people assume that we were all cramped in a littl 2 bedroom house and we lived like bums or something lol. My parents wanted lots of kids and could aford them so they had them.|`|gs8MSMs3aa	No, i think unmarried people with kids from like a million different marriages and partners are rather trashy, but not necesarily, i mean its all in the individual, but a nice family with a lot of children is not trashy at all!<br>  <br>  and yeah i might assume that there was a little chaos but i dont automatically think of some house tipped upside down! especially the age of your children, most of them being rather mature.  <br>  <br>  but neglectful?  definatly not! i mean people with all these kids obviously know how to care for children, and mostly adore children, as they had so many!<br>  <br>  so, no on the trashy, maybe on the chaos (not in a bad way tho) and no on the neglectful<br>  <br>  hope that answers your question!  :)|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I guess I'm the odd one out because generally I assume that parents hae large families because they can afford to do so. Usually they are very organised, frugal and often self-sufficient. I have family that have or had large families because they were catholic and loved children. They worked hard to provide for their children (including private education) and they ran an organised home. The children had/have fantastic childhoods because they always have someone to play with, they sit down to family dinners and do a lot of family orientated activities. There is usually a lot of love to go around in bigger families. I have one child and know I couldn't handle more. I'm too disorganised, can't stick to a schedule and I'm not as financially savvy as I should be.<br>  Single mothers with a lot children are rare and isolated cases. They just receive a lot negatvie media coverage. <br>  You sound like you have a wonderful family.<br>  Good luck.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I also have 6 kids and I am 11 weeks pregnant! My kids are 9,7,6,5,15 months and 4 months.<br>  <br>  Craziness is what everyone assumes. What they don't realize is that most moms that have lots of kids have these amazing things called a schedule and a chore list! My house is by no means spotless but yes it is a lot cleaner then many other homes I have been in with a lot less kids!<br>  <br>  My children know that toys stay in the playroom ONLY and they must CLEAN UP after themselves in every situation!|`|6JimMvcDaa	In these days, Yes. People assume because they are slobs, what must it be like in a large family ? I was raised in a family of 8 and we all had chores to do. My mother kept her house clean at all times. You never saw dirty clothes on the floor or dishes in the sink. Right after a meal the food was put away and the dishes were done. We had no dish washer. There was 5 girls and dad said we were the dish washers. We had no dryer, we hung the clothes on the line , brought them in when they were dry, folded them and put them away. They did not stay in the basket of on a pile on the bed. <br>  We made our beds every morning and you did not dare even sit on it to mess it up. Even back then our house was cleaner than the average person's with less kids. Oh. My mother also held down a job and catered to my fathers ever wish. Don't sweat the assumption. Your kids are better off than 80 percent of the kids today if you are giving them chores to do. They won't be so spoiled.
3r1TwMCQaa	Only you can answer this question. What you need to decide is are you ready to have sex? and Are you having sex because you want to or because you feel pressured to have sex? If you are not comfortable with this decision then don't do it, if it feels right then well I'm not going to tell you to do it but you make the call.|`|mOxVL0luaa	its ok if u think if its fine, just don't regret it when he done and dump u a side. personally i think u should be with him longer maybe 1 year or 2 together then engage is sex. its coz to really know he trusted u.... 4 month is not enough to prove his trust|`|BWXfaJQGaa	Absolutely not.|`|kw80YHMLaa	If u are asking is it ok to sleep with someone u obviously are too young to ask sorry|`|hfHnjjmXaa	u r still a baby, girl. dont do it.

I thought that you had "a four month" ie "a four month old BABY" with your boyfriend and was wondering if it was okay to have sex with him.  It doesn't help that it's in the newborn and baby section.<br>  <br>  So, I change my answer.  Don't, you sound too young.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	Judging by the way your question is worded, you are way too young to be thinking about having sex. Wait, you'll be happy later on!

She started sleeping 8 hours about more than six months ago.|`|qA9JtQBMaa	My 16 weeks old has been sleeping 9 hours for a few weeks now, even from 3 weeks old he was sleeping 6-7 hours at night.<br>  <br>  Last night he slept from 7pm until 6am... let's hope it continues!|`|byM2zxPAaa	i have a very tight routine... she has a nap everyday at 11am and will wake up at 2pm.<br>  At 5pm its bath time, dinner and cuddle time. <br>  then at 6pm i put her in her bed and wont hear from her until about 9am the next morning.. i started this routine from day one and she started sleeping through when she was 2 weeks old.<br>  the main reson babies wake up during the night is because they are thirsty... a warm bottle of water does the trick.. for me anyway|`|k7zH1HQvaa	mine started sleeping fine for around 11hrs at about 2yrs old but i have always had her on a strict schedule in bed by 8:00 then she normaly gets up around 7:30 but she has always been pritty good about sleeping not sure about your child but strict schedule has always worked for me|`|FYiKgeN8aa	Let the teething take it's course.  Naturally that is going to cause a child to wake up from sleeping.  Your child will sleep through the night on their own.  Don't rush it too much.|`|52U22fiAaa	Once I got her into a strict bedtime routine, about one year old.  Before that, it was good sleep with a few bad weeks here and there :)|`|u9mcnyduaa	Hi I have a 20 month old boy and a 4 yr old boy they both started sleeping through at 6 months, however with my youngest i had to use the controlled crying technique which worked amazingly it only took one night!

A8ofpjUiaa	At around 15 months my son went to 1 nap at about 11 am for 3 - 3.5 hours. We tried moving all his sleeps an hour later so that he could have lunch before napping, but he would still wake up every morning at the same time.<br>  <br>  He's now 21 months and still does the single day nap but now at 12.30pm for 2 - 2.5 hours.<br>  <br>  In both situations he went to bed at 7.30pm but it was the waking time that's now moved back 1 hour to a decent 7am.|`|1WBimx1laa	My daughter was taking 2 naps a day until she was about 14 months, then gradually she would take 1 nap a day and still does and she is fixing to be 2.

I think it is what the child is use to, she sleeps around my work schedule.|`|staqho0Baa	My daughter will be turning 1 next week and at about 9 or 10 months dropped down to one nap a day but that nap is usually around three hours long.  Sometimes if the first one is short she will go down for another one in the late afternoon but usually just the one.  She wakes up at 7 or 730 and by 930 or 10 is down for her nap.|`|5OwKQmqbaa	14 months.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	10 months and its barely an hour a day now hes two years old and he hardly ever naps|`|TrZ2ecnUaa	my daughter was about 9-10 months
dVAiuqZCaa	yes,also throughout labor.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	No I never had anything pass just before labour!!!|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	I didn't experience that with any of my three children, however, it could be a blessing because if your bowels are completely emptied out, it allows more room for the head to descend and pass through.|`|sNv4VEM6aa	I never had that although during labour, due to the pressure my body emptied the bowels while the baby was coming out.<br>  so if you have diarrhea before labour it will give more room for your baby to come out and it will also save you the embarrasment i had to cope with lol|`|VeuJB4lEaa	when i was in the hospital ready to be induced, i couldnt get off the toilet, i need the toilet usually when i am as nervous but it was ridiculous, but when they when to induce me they realised i was already 3cm dialted, i think thats why i couldnt get off the loo because my body was flushing everything out ready!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Less than seven hours after I was sick at both ends, we had a baby!
C4ibOR7Laa	yes, its called a missed miscarriage, it can stay in you for a long time, there was once a women who carried her foetus for 46 years, that was the most its ever been though, but often people got for a 12 week scan and find out their baby stopped growing at 5-6 weeks, and has to be removed<br>  <br>  <br>  oh yes, she knew she was pregnant, here is an article about it <a href="http://tywkiwdbi.blogspot.com/2008/10/lithopedion-stone-baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://tywkiwdbi.blogspot.com/2008/10/li...</a>|`|kN00x0Vaaa	Yes you can miscarry without bleeding. It is far from normal but there are a few cases where women miscarried without knowing it. It's usually very early on this happens though. The further into your pregnancy you get the more likely more blood will show if this occurs.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	the bleeding that happens when you deliver a baby or have a miscarriage is because  the uterus creates a cushion around the baby, and it is lined with blood. so if you have a miscarriage, the uterus will clean itself of the contents, which is blood. so no you can't miscarry without bleeding.
aSRHdWIYaa	Call the doc and see what he recommends.  You don't want to try any over the counter meds on her as it could be dangerous.<br>  <br>  Play it safe and call the doctor.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	she needs some cream, i think u can get it from the chemist but u may need to take her to see the doctor<br>  <br>  it can be very painful and sore if lets and it itches like mad which may answer ur other Q about her crying<br>  my older daughter gets it and its horrible!!<br>  <br>  keep her feet dry and let them breath so maybe leave her without socks for short periods but u may catch it so speak to the doctor
dnG7fhnbaa	I know how you feel, I had four miscarriages and have found it almost impossible to relax throughout this pregnancy...But I'm 19 weeks now and I've never made it that far before....that's what I keep telling myself and it's what you need to do too. You are five weeks further through this pregnancy than you have ever been before! That's a fantastic thing...every day your chance of loosing the baby gets less and less...you've seen the baby on the scan, keep looking at the pic and telling yourself it's ok.<br>  <br>  It might be beneficial to start up a hobby or something to relax yourself; yoga or meditation? Swimming? Maybe start doing something like arts and crafts...start a "pregnancy scrap book"...or something.<br>  <br>  The best way to get through is positive thinking, only 19 weeks till you can hold your little baby in your arms and know it's all ok. Worrying will only cause problems so stay chilled out! :o)<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck! :o) x|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Try some pregnancy yoga, it will keep your mind focused on your baby but in a good way and you'll get into shape, it will also help you become more comfortable with your body so you can start to trust it. Stressing out will not help, all it does it put cortisol (stress hormone) in your blood stream which the baby gets also. Just take a deep breath and think positive affirmations about you, your body and the baby's health. Calm down honey, you are passed the point when most miscarriages happen.|`|VMASMHX6aa	It's totally natural that you feel like this after all you've been through. You are going to worry about your son every day now for the rest of your life, it's all part of being a mummy!|`|L8SqgQCkaa	worring only adds stress, stress is not a good thing. stop it.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I am a paranoid person myself and found a relaxation tape and hypnobirthing have helped me during my second pregnancy.  You might be able to attend a class or two or see a hypnotherapist who will talk you through your worries and help you to release the past and let go.  I think you need some help on this one. <br>  <br>  You are not alone and I wish you all the best.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	i am absolutely sure u'll be fine, but worrying will be natural for you...would it be useful to know that babies become viable at about 24 weeks it is considered viable - that is, it could survive if born now. That fact helped me, so you should calm down after that...but everyday is a bonus so every day you get through is a step closer - remember that! Good luck!|`|9ncWshWBaa	I understand how you feel! I had missed miscarriage at 11 weeks and know how horrible it is. <br>  <br>  Here are the facts!  unless you have had 3 or more miscarriages, there is no reason to think that there is anything wrong with you and that you have any higher risk than anyone else who has not had a miscarriage of it happening again!  Your missed miscarriage was (unless they found anyother reason) simply bad luck! The twins you lost will always be in your heart and you will never forget them but this pregnancy you are having now is a new one and there fore just because you lost your twins does not mean that you will lose this baby!  <br>  <br>  As hard as it is, try to treat this new pregnancy as a fresh one and try not to connect it to the last one as the risks of you losing this new pregnancy at 21 weeks is so much lower than if it was for example  before 12 weeks. <br>  <br>  remember these facts !  One miscarriage does NOT mean that you will miscarry again! you do not have higher chance than anyone else who has not had a miscarriage. only after 3 miscarriages does it indicate there MIGHT be a problem. Now keep telling yourself this and try to relax and enjoy the rest of your pregnancy.|`|BNCpLcLoaa	Hi Louise, <br>  its hard to give advise to someone who has gone through what you have gone through. When I was pregnant with my first child I was the same as you. I ended up going into therapy because I couldn't sleep. I wouldn't leave the house in case someone knocked into me or started a fight (rough area) and I was scared to sleep at night in case someone broke in. Everything I did worried me that I would lose my baby. She was born in January 2006, very healthy. I think what you need to keep in mind is that all the worry is no good for the baby. I found that meditation class helped me a lot. It sound horrible to say but, if you are going to lose the baby then you will. But there is more than a good chance that you wont. You need to start enjoying your pregnancy for your sake and the baby's, remember that what you feel the baby also feels. :)<br>  Try relaxing with some nice music, hug your bump and try to smile. :)<br>  I'm not 15 week pregnant and I am trying to do the same, its not easy, believe me every mother worries about losing their baby.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk more add me to your messenger the_broken_soul@yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  Chin up :)|`|MFsuN8Doaa	I get a bit like that from time to time. Even with a mere three days to go, I'm still a bag of jitters. <br>  <br>  When I get worried, I get myself either a sugary or a warm drink, sit down and put my feet up. You see, this gets my baby kicking and once it starts kicking, then I feel easier and start thinking about all the wonderful things that will be happening once next week is over (fingers crossed). <br>  <br>  Also, is your partner understanding? It might help to spend plenty of time with him doing something that will take your mind off the pregnancy, like going somewhere nice or different. It can be trying on the mind when you worry, because all you think about is how is the baby but once you get away from that, you'll find you notice the baby more. <br>  <br>  Finally, you will start feeling the baby move more over the next few weeks, as it gets bigger, and you start feeling everything from somersaults and kicks to weird little movements which are the baby just stretching and moving position. That makes it a whole lot easier.<br>  <br>  You can drop me an email at galadriellauk@yahoo.co.uk if you need someone who has been in a similar situation to talk to. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|fiUF4cAXaa	You are half way through your pregnancy. Don't worry so much. This stress is not good for you or your baby. I would just enjoy my pregnancy and pray to God. I had alot of worries on my last pregnancy. The ultra sound revealed problems. Your ultra sound has not revealed anything to worry about. Try keeping your mind busy so that you dont worry so much. Dont worry about loosing your baby until the doctors give you something to worry about.
NMjM2X4taa	I go to church because Jesus is my Lord, my God, my All in All. I go to worship and adore my first love, Jesus Christ. 1 John 4:19 says "we love Him because He first loved us." <br>  <br>  most teens do not go to church because they have been brought up in spiritual darkness. living in the world, living for worldly pleasures. take a look around, most teens are never satisfied with anything. they have to have the newest clothes, the best car, a nicer TV, you name it, and they want it, but even when they get it they are never satisfied. <br>  <br>  The Bible is NOT a book of ferry tales, it is the greatest love story ever told. and the best part is, it's all true. I have found true satisfaction in life. sure there are some items I would like to have, but I recognize that Jesus Christ is all I need.|`|X1NVjZEKaa	Because some of us have evolved from ape and came to see the real truth about society and not live our life by a fiary tale book :)|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Because not all teenagers are religous.|`|2MUZQGMBaa	To me it's extremely boring and I dont believe any of the stuff that the preacher is saying|`|m4nKkFDUaa	Well, as a teenager myself, I find that teenagers in general have other "more interesting" things to be doing than going to mass. It's just today society, and I don't think they don't like churches, it's the whole sitting there for an hour without an ipod or nintendo etc. that bothers them!|`|eISzHe5maa	Because not everyone is religious or even cares to have a religion. I never went to church. My mom wasn't really religious so she just didn't take me. She thought that by the time I'm in my teens that I can decide for myself if I want to pursue any religion. Honestly, I don't. I don't know if it's because I don't believe in God or I just don't really care that much about it. <br>  <br>  I don't know if I'm Agnostic, Atheist, whatever I just say I'm not interested in religion. <br>  <br>  However, I don't try to hurt people or try to talk down others from their religious beliefs. If that's what they choose to believe then that's fine with me as long as they don't shove their opinions down my throat.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I used to believe when I was younger. <br>  I don't now. It can't be proven that he controls things. <br>  I believe that once upon a time a man did exist and claimed all this stuff and people followed his beliefs but I don't believe their is an all controlling power. <br>  <br>  People say hurricanes and tornados are god's will. Uhhhhhhhhhh BULLSHIT. <br>  In the south, you hear this next one a lot. " God gave him that heart attack, it was his time to go because god said so." Uhhhhhhhh BULLSHIT. <br>  The fat *** ate himself into oblivion and sat around and drank beer while watching football. God didn't give him a heart attack, he brought it on himself. <br>  I believe in science, not some man puppeting us around, doing things like that. <br>  <br>  I don't go to church because I don't believe. <br>  Plus I HATE getting up early and I won't get up early for anything. <br>  <br>  <br>  I go with my friend to her youth group sometime but a lot of the time I don't feel comforatable. Mostly because I don't believe and I am worried that someone will try to start talking to me about religion and I won't know what in the world to say.|`|gTiQLYCZaa	well, im a teen and i might not go to church, but at my mum and dads church there are LOADS of teens who go there.<br>  there is about 25 teens there, and my friend goes to another one that has loads of teens there, its a big church and she said theres around 50 teens that go, alot or what!|`|inMfHLWoaa	I think you may have gottern a stereotype into your head. :( <br>  <br>  I am a teen and i don't go to churches because i feel no need too,  but i'm sure that others do! my freind goes every sunday :)<br>  <br>  This is my opinion...:) :)<br>  <br>  x<br>  x<br>  x|`|fMllzc6laa	Well, I would say that religion has lost a lot of it's popularity in the last couple of years...<br>  As being a teenager, I do not feel like I NEED to go to church to keep believing in my religion.<br>  <br>  That's only my opinion|`|t7iOijRPaa	i go to church every sunday...its not all teenagers you know.<br>  <br>  and i guess because they see it as to early,or a waste of time.|`|dShhCo8yaa	When I was a teen I went to church every Sunday with my mum, dad and nana.|`|caVLeRKXaa	uh wer you born yesterday wats so great about church its boring its just a building with a bunch of seats in it really i would rather hang out in school all day it has all the facillities a teenager would want a food tech area full of food a computer lab internet woodshop art studio sports hall musical instrumentsairconditioned libary with books and some private rooms to study by watching vidioes & dvds aghh teenagers heaven oh and canteen with slushies and pie and.... oh and all my friends including my best friend wich is my twin sister|`|xBZ5yzPbaa	I am a teenager and I LOVE churchs.

7HzfgRmwaa	mine was flab until about 28 weeks!! You  may have some more weeks to go before it starts getting hard!|`|G9UNW0NYaa	I'm 21 weeks, and it's just starting to get hard.  With my first pregnancy, I was wearing my skinny jeans until I was 6 months along.  It'll be a few more weeks until you can feel it while laying down.   This may be TMI, but try to feel for it right after an orgasm.  Your uterus bunches into a tight ball after one, even as early on as you are.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	Because your baby is the size of a pickle right now.Be patient.|`|fCPocLtGaa	not sure|`|sNv4VEM6aa	I didn't realise your stomach went hard during pregnancy.<br>  When my baby is sitting close to the front of my stomach it can get hard, but it's still soft enough to feel the baby and how the baby is sitting etc.<br>  So i wouldn't be worried hun. And you're only 12wks, stress less and enjoy pregnancy lol, you don't want to worry the whole way through, it's not good for you or the baby.|`|Yvy0V2ZJaa	It really depends on your pre-pregnancy weight. I WAS average build (no abs but not a tire either). I was doughy until about 25-30 weeks pregnant. Typically, if you lay flat on the floor around 15 weeks you can start to feel a ball half way between your pelvic bone and your belly button. I had these same worries wondering if I wasn't getting big enough. Now at 36 weeks I feel too big. lol. Good luck and best wishes|`|PdW09cmOaa	You have a little while yet before you can feel arms and legs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Congratulations|`|H41u0B8Jaa	My stomach didn't get hard until I was in my 6th month!  Up until then I just looked like I had a chubby stomach.|`|myEwHgI1aa	Your uterus has a lot to grow yet! Don't worry, it will get hard soon enough. It takes about 20 or more weeks to really "feel" pregnant. After 20 weeks,the top of the uterus will be about where you navel is or higher.
kSZx9cY5aa	My school aged children are 5 and 15, and they attend they same school I teach at so I usually drive them. If I have to be at school really early or if I don't have to come in later they catch busses or daddy  or my daughters boyfriend drives them. Their dad drives our 3yo to day care too.<br>  At the moment he drives them all to school/day care because I just had our newest little one, so i'm on maternity leave and honestly would rather stay at home in my p.js then have to get up and drive :p lol.|`|qA9JtQBMaa	My 15 and 12 year old attend a Private school 40 minutes away, so they take the school bus which is chartered by their school. It is good value - it costs $700 per year and takes them from home straight to school and back again every day. It would cost me more than that to drive them.<br>  <br>  My next 2, aged 10 & 8 attend Primary School, which happens to be directly across the road from our house. As it is a main road, they have to walk to the school crossing 3 houses up and cross there. I try to walk them myself, but with a 3 years old and 16 weeks old, sometimes I simply can't, so I just watch from the driveway that they get to the crossing safely and the crossing lady escorts them across the road.|`|jLYTKr33aa	We either go by subway or car.  We often have to drive because my son goes to a private school that is not in our district, so it's a bit of a commute for us.  It can take up to an hour by subway, while it's only a half - hour drive by car.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	They take the bus to, but I pick them up most days in the car.<br>  I was in total shock and panic the first time my 8 y/o got on the bus by mistake and wasn't there when I picked her sister up. Nearly had a heart attack.|`|ThnKiLfTaa	My school aged children are 5 and 13. My 13 yr old walks most days unless it is raining. But as far as my 5 yr old it all depends on the weather.  Either I drive him or we walk. If it is raining or realllllly cold outside or in the Summertime if it is realllllly hot outside I will drive him. But if the weather is nice then we will walk.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	My son gets the bus. It comes at the same time I leave for work, so it good for both of us !!|`|f29c201fc2a29ba2d20c78d6c9cc3733aa	i drive my kids!|`|2qhUhd8Eaa	My oldest daughter does school online, but my 4 yr. old daughter goes to preschool and I drive her.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	we walk coz its only 10 mins away, yet i do see mums driving which i dont understand when the school is so close must take longer to get everyone in the car & out again then park than walk to our school!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	We do not have to go anywhere, as we homeschool!  We simply gather at the table to begin our school day, and then migrate wherever-my daughter likes to do her reading in her room.  We often do lessons outside at the picnic table.<br>  <br>  But, of course, when we have activities/classes/lessons away from the home, I drive-we live in the country and while we enjoy walking, it is just for the excercise and scenery, as there is not anywhere to really walk to.
VR9KhbEgaa	I am a VERY thrifty mom. I have 6 kids and I am 11 weeks pregnant as well. We have no choice but to come up with every way possible to cut corners. I am addicted to Craigslist.org for things like clothes, toys,strollers, or anything else I need for the little ones. I also refuse to pay full price for just about anything. I will shop at the end of the season to buy clothes for the next year in the next size up.Same with summer sandals and beach shoes. I also go to places like Target and Walmart right after Christmas when they have tons of toys on sale and get all the kids b-day presents for the year for a fourth of the normal price.<br>  At the grocery store I clip coupons and I always buy the store brand in most foods if I don't have a coupon. Kroger by us always has a "daily special" in their meat section with the meats that expire in the next few days. They mark them at least half price and I stock up and put them in the freezer and make sure I use then within the week.<br>  Going out to eat I also search for coupons and go on the nights where they have  the kids eat for free deals. I also have a credit card where you earn rewards points and can get gift cards to places like Chilis and Red Lobster.<br>  I buy my diapers, formula, wipes, etc. at the local wholesale club and registered on line to get baby coupons.. ( I got 207 Luv's daipers yesterday for $19 with my coupon...I was soooo excited!)<br>  At home my kids know not to even think about leaving a light on anywhere they are not at! If it is light outside they open the blinds and don't even use the light.<br>  Wow...I could go on forever...lol. Hope that helps you a little bit and good luck being thrifty!|`|f29c201fc2a29ba2d20c78d6c9cc3733aa	i use coupons all the time. for stuff like food to soap to toys! <br>  i print them off the computer so i can get more them 1 of the ones ill really use! if u live in usa n have an CVS get an CVS card and start readin the flyer to see if u can earn extra bucks throw CVS usen the card!!!!<br>  Also i shop at none name brand stores. <br>  I reuse clothes from my older kids for he younger one.<br>  i buy used clothes n toys when i can. like for craigslist.com n yard sales!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	for his books I generally go to this consignment place near me where all the kids books are 69 cents and buy 4 gets one free....sometimes I get his clothes there too. I also go to a special children's consignment shop for clothes....they tend to be a little better than the other place.
sNv4VEM6aa	hav u tried toning down on the walking, do you have somebody around you that could drive you places or possibly pick up the stuff that you would normally walk for, i'm not saying quit walking altogether as that could do quite a bit of harm to your body. Just tone down a little mayb.<br>  <br>  Have you also tried sleeping with a pillow between your legs, that helps me, i have a terrible muscle pain between my legs, theres nothing the midwife can do but suggest hot packs, but being summer i don't particularly want them lol.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I agree with Nicole S - if you can possibly reduce the amount of walking you are doing, I think it will make a huge difference to you. I find I'm extremely sore after doing a huge walk and it takes me a couple of days to recover.<br>  <br>  As for the not sleeping - join the club.  I'm up at 2am for about the 5th night in a row.  My problem is restless legs and a baby that won't go to sleep at night.  Sigh!|`|MFsuN8Doaa	Mmm... can't your midwife up your referral to urgent? My hospital has a long list, but my midwife nagged them, telling them there was no point in putting me on the waiting list which was about a month when the baby was due in three weeks!!
agwxFmITaa	You are correct, there is no best time, only different times.  And slight trade offs.  I had my first child at 21 and my second at 24.  I had masses of energy and now find I still have enough left for my grandchildren!  My younger daughter was over 30 when she had her first child, there is a maturity about her child-rearing which I did not have.  She is also in a position where financial decisions were made before her children were born.  BUT all in all, it's what works for the individual!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	When your<br>  A) Married<br>  B) Financially stable<br>  C) Happy<br>  D) Ready|`|gx4s68s8aa	Sounds great to me.  For you it sounds like you will most likely have a stable life in all areas- career, personally, and as a couple.  And although it is not completely necessary to be completely stable to start a family, it is ideal.  Having a baby can be a rather difficult time- it is just a large a adjustment in the best of situations.  And if there is a complication or difficulty during pregnancy then it can be really tough.  So if you have your life "together" it just makes it all that easier.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	There is no "perfect age". The real issues are the ones that affect the prospective children.<br>  For example, I had my first two whilst in my early 20's. I was immature, unsettled and financially incapable which reflected on  the children and their quality of life.<br>  I've since had two more, I'm now in my 40's. I'm more settled and my youngest have better prospects and a more comfortable home/ life.<br>  However, my son is in his early 20's, has a good career ( also his partner) and their son has a good quality of life to match.<br>  <br>  If you have a good, loving relationship, and a fairly decent comfortable home then I should go, for it.<br>  <br>  Children are the best !<br>  <br>  Edit: Toniann, my wife was the least maternal woman ever, but now she has kids she is the BEST mum ever !|`|ytE1q20taa	In my opinion between 20 and 25 is the perfect age because you're not too young or too old to be really active with your baby and run around with him/her and then you are still young enough to have more kids if you wanted too.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	By the time you're fiancially stable, and you're mature, I'd say 24-36. If I ever do have children I'd want to have the 26-31.|`|keEwsjxYaa	i think late 20s early 30s is just right, and as you've said you have everything to start a healthy and happy family. fanancial support, a roof over your head and a stable relationship, and that's when i believe it's the right time. because your husband is slightly older i'd say you could even try a year earlier, because to me it seems you have everything but if i were in your position i'd start my family in the next 1 or 2 years.<br>  <br>  hopethiishelps x|`|uRKZkBfjaa	I had my first child at 21 and that was too young, then I had my second child at 27 which I felt was the right age and then my third child at 34 which was a good age for a sibling in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I think it is important to realise that children are a huge change to your life and it should be a time when you and your partner are ready to move on in your relationship and become parents.<br>  <br>  Good luck for the future.|`|TrBoPj92aa	too young is under 20 and too old is over 45 <br>  <br>  i first became mum at 18, fell pregnant at 17 it was really hard and tough<br>  <br>  second time i fell pregnant with Aimee + Sophie at 26 it was great i loved it , so for me the perfect age was 26, i hope to have another baby in the next 2-5years but i don't want a big gap between Kaila and the new baby as she is almos 10 but i don't feel ready to have another baby now as the twins are only 6months <br>  <br>  i think 27/28 will be a great age not too young, not too old great!|`|0VHolTVEaa	I dont think there is any "RIGHT" time, personally couples should have children when they are ready and can financially afford it. I think its great you are career minded before having children, that shows maturity and dedication. I had my first child when i was 28 and i dont have any regrets. I cant understand why girls would want kids before 21 as they are still young themselves, it all depends on circumstances.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i think as long as you re married and committed to one another and you are reasonably financially stable - that is a good time. there is really no specific age that is appropriate - but if you know my perspective at all - somewhere between 20 and 50 seems right.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I'm 26 I'd love to have a child in the next year. Hubby is not going to resign up with the military tho, don't want him going back to Afghanistan. So, got to wait till he finds a new job :)|`|rgOBHB5uaa	mid-twenties|`|xsvDrtrRaa	i think for me its when you have much money and time for your children.|`|cP1Asd7waa	I think that the age you want to have children at is the perfect time. It also depends on how responsible you are, so you can properly care for your child.  I think that if you go out and party a lot like every weekend is too much and that it would be too young to start a family.  But like I said if you are responsible then I think its a perfect age.  <br>  <br>           Good Luck!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I was 23, 25 and 27 when I had my children, and I've just turned 29.<br>  <br>  I don't think I've done anything differently with any of my children based on my age.<br>  <br>  I wanted to have my family first and then concentrate on a career. Although I feel that being a mum is a career in it's own right lol.<br>  <br>  We were married for a year before we had our first, and I am a stay at home mum. We never got used to having 2 salaries so don't miss it. You don't have to have lots of money to have a wonderful family and lovely children :) And neither does being younger mean you have more energy!|`|eu4q4WbEaa	People usually think about getting stable and having enough money before kids, which is all good...<br>  <br>  But I think that after you finish university...like 21 or 22 you should think about a child...and my reason for that is because you should also think about the age difference between you and your child. You do not want to be too old for your child...you would want to be like friends..<br>  <br>  However, if you have your child late, then there is going to be a huge age difference and it may be harder for you to understand your child.<br>  <br>  And why not have a baby when you are 21 or 22...why wait so long for that joy??|`|apvqcpEFaa	I personally don't want kids, they're just not for me. I don't have that maternal instinct. But, to each their own! I think that between 28-32 is the right age, or when you are content in you relationship & both have the steady career for the rest of your life. Stability is what everything depends on, that's all.|`|GdDCilHGaa	I would have the children later. Carry on with your career! Women are having children a lot older these days!<br>  <br>  Lucinder x|`|w9TzZCt8aa	my mum was 20, 25 and 27 when she had all of us. she says you wouldn't want to change her ages because she is young so she takes us out allot   she is 32 now|`|qMBf2vgiaa	21 yrs old or 29|`|E6obQSpraa	When you can afford children, when you have a good job and a nice home, between 26 - 31 id say.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	once you've been married for 10 yrs, have your debt paid off and can afford for one parent to stay home with the child|`|BlPJw4iAaa	Im in the exact same situation as you. Im 27 and my hub is 29. We've been together 11 years and married for 3 years. We started TTC Sept 08. As ive never been on the contraceptive pill I thought it wouldn't be long before we conceived.......little did i know. We are still trying now, I didn't realise that it would take so long. I agree, that there is no perfect age to start a family, but we, like you, are both professionals and have worked hard in our careers so far, going through uni, holidays etc. My advice to you is start trying ASAP, you can always return to your career after children, I think the older you get the more complications there could be with thepregnancyy, and the harder it gets. By the sound of ityou'vee provided an excellent start to the base of your family. GOod luck!

My other friend found out 5 days before her period was due. A girl I work with found out when she was 9 weeks. All depends really! <br>  <br>  All the best x|`|rbloxE6paa	my friend didn't find out till she was 5 months!! she was on the pill and was still having periods too!|`|AA12254690	Well I found out at 14 weeks. Mind you I am not fat lol. I just thought I was gaining weight due to my new job and increase in appetite. I had been gagging a lot for about 2 weeks every morning. However I was not throwing up just like a gag reflex maybe a few times every morning. It especially happened more when brushing my teeth so I thought it was my mouthwash. Afterdiscontinuingg that specific mouthwash and still gagging every morning at work I called my doctor and he just told me to take a pregnancy test and then if it was negative then to come in! So I had to wait for the results and I thought it was a complete waste of time! Considering that my husband and I had been having unprotected sex for about 2 years and I had never gotten pregnant! Anyway so yea when I called for the results I was like yea I need to confirm my negative pregnancy test results in order to get an appt with my doctor to see whats wrong with me and when the nurse said congrats you are pregnant...... Well I was ecstatic... The next day I found out I was almost 4 months prego!!!!|`|xwOwsZvEaa	my friend found out when she was 35 weeks only because her belly button popped out!|`|ytE1q20taa	When I was about 2 months gone. It didn't even occur to me that I had missed 2 periods.|`|BTc4Qp48aa	I was 6 months along by the time my mum found out. Mind you, she'd been trying to concieve for 17 years! I kid you not. She's in her 60's now. She was either 36 or 38 when she had me. I'm lousy with maths! lol
AA10780655	Well let me tell you with my first son, I started having extremely painful contractions. They were so close together that they felt like they never ended. I tried to brave it out at home for a while, but I couldnt take it anymore so I went to the hospital. When I got there they told me I was only 1cm and I wasnt in labor! So they sent me home. Well the pain never stopped, and about 3 hours later at home my water broke. Went right back to the hospital and when I got there I was 10cm and his head was coming out!<br>  So dilation can happen extremely fast at time and you not even know it. Try to take some tylenol and lay down. If your still in pain later on today I would go to the local Labor&Delivery. They can monitor your contractions and also check your cervix. If nothing has changed, they could at least give you something to help with the pain.<br>  Good luck!|`|YMbhiqASaa	Theres not much you can do. Im due on the 24th and I get at least 2 painful BH contractions an hour. I went to the dr. on wednesday and im not dilating but the baby is really low. But anywayz when i get them I try standing if im sitting or drinking water.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	i would call the hospital and see what they say and then go from there..try lying on your side and drink some cold water..good luck|`|AKHCHOj8aa	Unfortunately there is very little you can do. I have heard that laying on your left side will ease the pain a little. With this being your first baby they may have to induce you. I went 3 weeks over with my first. This is my second and my due date is Feb.26 and I have been contracting with a lot of pressure no dilation and the baby is still high. The doctor told me to try and relax and think about being induced on my due date.
hA8XL17Uaa	Most pregnancy test can come up positive from about 5 days before you missed period, so if you have already missed your period TAKE THE TEST and im sure the result will be accurate!<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  x

mx3gFmIKaa	Sometimes babies have IUGR-intra uterine growth retardation and the best thing would be to deliver early if growth is too retarded, then growing outside the womb is better.  It would be best for survival if the fetus was over 450grams or roughly 1 lb.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	why would the DR suggest they deliver it early if it is smaller than average?<br>  <br>  i would think that if the baby was born extremely small, then there would most likely be breathing problems. But i still dont get why the Dr would want to deliver it sooner. they longer it is in there, the better chance it has. 25 weeks is still VERY early|`|J6IOqzL0aa	i think you need to get a 2nd opinion because delivering early sounds crazy to me if the baby is small unless you sister is in danger for example she has preeclampsia. The best place for a small baby is inside its mummy. Im not sure how they can even consider delivering early at this stage.  I hope everything works out ok. Averages are only something to compare to there will always be much bigger and much small babies at each stage.
AA11283706	If I were you I would buy the clearblue fertility monitor. It is expensive, but so much better than the individual tests at the store. You test daily and it can tell you the time you are leading up to ovulation, which is really helpful. It uses a system of 3 bars to tell you how close you are. I managed to get pregnant on two bars. I highly recommend it. They are very accurate. Best of Luck!|`|ikS4bAg9aa	i only know that it comes after 4 to 5 weeks after it has finished<br>  <a href="http://poemspoemsforlife.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://poemspoemsforlife.blogspot.com/</a>|`|U1RcZjqJaa	My neighbor used an ovulation test and had success the first month. She claimed they worked great! Her husband was traveling a lot for work and just happend to be home the time the test said she was ovulating and that was the only time they had sex, so I don't see how it could be wrong!|`|0Qiscnkeaa	I use the Answer brand every month and it definitely helps determine when I will O.

C4ibOR7Laa	i used first response, but iv also used clear blue digital, which says pregnant or not pregnant, so there is no looking for lines and saying "i think i see one, am i pregnant?" so the clear blue digital is really good|`|ytE1q20taa	I used pregnatest and the little pink line came up as soon as I peed on it, I didn't have to wait the usual 2/3 minutes.<br>  I will definitely be using it again in the future and I recommend it to everyone who asks.|`|WSXDQ4bpaa	I like the digital ones, they are less confusing.

eNAwuvrmaa	There is a very small chance, but it is unlikely.  Sperm does not die when it comes into contact with oxygen, as is often believed, but only once it has dried.  It can live in warm, moist environments for up to 3 days.  So if he did have any on his hand and it was still wet, you could get pregnant from it.  If it was dry, no chance.  You can ask him.<br>  <br>  From day 11 to 17 after you started your period is when you are most fertile, so you saying it's 12 days before your next period doesn't help cuz I don't know how long your cycles normally are.  But if it's 28 days, then it sounds like it was near the end of your fertile period, so could be dangerous.<br>  <br>  Ask him if he knows if he had any on his hand.  Get a pregnancy test or morning-after pill if you want to be sure.  Can get these from your pharmacy.  If semen did enter, the morning after pill will stop any resulting pregnancy.  You can take it up to 72 hours after intercourse, or in your case, the sperm entering the body.  Taking it more than 72 hours after the fact is dangerous, can damage the already-formed foetus.<br>  <br>  Make him wear a condom next time, and be careful of dangerous games!|`|sfhyZlMOaa	no you're not..but just to be sure,take a pregnancy test and the next time you and your boyfriend do that,make sure that he wipe his fingers dry before he put his fingers in you...and you can't get pregnant because only the guy have the power to send sperm cell in your ovaries and can't be done by just fingers|`|60ba2c216103d031928abf198be1d4deaa	You will never graduate from school, you will never get a college education.

ytE1q20taa	I wouldn't worry too much yet, girl's can just be late sometimes, for no reason.<br>  If she still hasn't had her period in say another 4 days, then she should take a test.<br>  Good luck either way.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Four days isn't all that long.  Sometimes my period is 3-4 days late.  Guess you'll just have to wait a little longer and see.  For now, chill.|`|ATyHswTTaa	i get hungry around the time of my period so just because she eating loads dont mean she is pregnant.. i have often been week late also with mine and if ur usen condoms and careful check that no leeks after sex then shouldnt be.. but if been in contact with her without a condom ie. at urself or her playing with u then touch her ownself then its possible that way.. only way to really know is take a test and find out but dont worry, i was preg at 17 and doing just fine, in college, own house and car and doing well and so is my child.. so not all doom and gloom over been pregnant anyways.. best luck anyways..|`|yUyx2nhmaa	Everyone gets paranoid when they first start having sex.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	The real worry about doing hot water when you are pregnant is the fact that it draws blood away from your core including your uterus, it draws it all into your extremities to cool your body down. You are not suppose to go over 100 degrees, 101 max but only for 5 - 10 minutes. Be careful!|`|k6x2lVLYaa	Hot water can cause shock.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sooo, I don't think so ..<br>  <br>  <br>  <333~xx|`|VJ2aG6znaa	I think that soaking in hot water can be dangerous for the pregnancy.  Just think how woosy you feel after you have a hot bath.  See your doctor or midwife.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	hot water raises your body temp and could infact cook your baby.

fZITwfi0aa	Ur a girl right? Well to bad the roumrer spreader isn't a guy or u could just kick him in his balls. Believe once u kick a guy in his balls he leave u alone. But since its a girl ill give u two opition. If this girl is a very popular girl, DESTROY HER POPULARITY! If this girl is a loner, EXPOLIAT THAT AND HAVE PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF HER!<br>  Before you do this tell another teacher like the principal and your parents but don't tell them about your plan to DESTROY HER! also when you DESTROY HER make sure she kinda knows that u did it. She will get mad and try to spread the rumor and makes sure the principal is there when she. It is better to catch someone red handed.<br>  <br>  Also you had the fear if you tell someone she will say u told her. Make sure when ur talking to your principal and ur parent u start crying and say u didn't come to them earlier since she threatned you that she would tell everybody you told her and she won't leave u alone. This will makes sure when she says that you told her they won't believe her and they will be on your side anymore.<br>  And if she admits why she is doing this and it is becuase of something u did sincerly say sorry.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK WITH THIS!|`|bibIAhN9aa	I dont know what you should do. <br>  When I was at school I never got bullied b/c I was very good at keeping my head down and staying out of trouble. <br>  Also I never showed any fear. Bullys look for fear, if u dont show any they got bored and leave u alone. <br>  One thing u could do to help, although you probably wont like the idea if youre a typical girl; learn a martial arts like aikido or kick boxing or something. It has many benefits. The most important for you being, self confidence and the ability to kick that bith's ***. <br>  If u learn how to look after yourself physically it will help u a lot with the non-physical bullying. <br>  If I had to go to school again I would learn a martial arts and whenever I got any trouble I'd kick the crap out of them, I'd be very proactively agressive, that would soon put an end to it believe me. <br>  Good luck.|`|ATyHswTTaa	right 1st off start saving ur msn conversation from her.. to do this open ur msn window, goto tools and options.. then click on messages and then save message history.. with this u have ur evidence in what she is doing.. also trick her into saying who she is and that she is spreading rumors for no reason.. also time to tell ur parents and ur principle, this girl will be kicked out school and u get to keep ur head up high like.. be strong and dont be scare.. everything is in ur favour not her..|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	YOU go and talk to the headmaster.<br>  Tell her/him that there is a girl who is spreading lies about you.<br>  If you wait until she tells on you, you will look like a liar and like you're only trying to get her in trouble.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Well, You are being stupid by talking about what is going on with her, on YA.  Yet refusing to mention the girl's name, to anyone in a position of authority at the school.  Which could end the whole problem.|`|BTc4Qp48aa	I'm afraid telling on the person usually does nothing, they just get worse. I'd change schools. If she tells the headmaster this rumour, it could cost this teacher his job, whether he did it or not. His credibility will be down the pipeline and people may suspect that he took advantage of you and you're protecting him. It could go very bad. <br>  <br>  I'd change schools. I did it 5 times in primary school and once in high school. It sounds incredibly unfair for you to to do this, but in my case it was the only choice.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You need to talk to your parents and the principal and the teacher about this now.  It's a problem for both of you.  You don't want people to start thinking you're a ****.  For him, if people start believing this, that teacher could lose his job and his teacher's license, and maybe go to prison.  It's not just your problem.<br>  <br>  If you saved any emails she sent you, or if you've deleted them but not emptied them out of your email trash folder, you have evidence against her.  Save them.  I don't know about chat or IM, but if there is a way to save anything she says to you on the computer, do it.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, be very very careful that you do not say or do ANYTHING that would give them the wrong idea or tend to support her lie.  Don't be the first one in the classroom or the last one out of the classroom.  Don't say anything to him the whole class doesn't hear.  He needs to be very careful, too, but he probably knows more about this type of thing than you do.<br>  <br>  Do the right thing and you can hold your head up high.|`|c9NuCZnaaa	go to your head master and explain the situation. You dont have to say who it was. just say it's a rumour and it's not true. just so that nobody gets into trouble. Tell him everything you've put on here, and pretty soon it will die down. apart from that you can't do much. just keep setting people straight.|`|qYJKJpzkaa	You need to tell another teacher like the head teacher, depute of someone ... about the bulling .. and that the rumour is a lie cos she could tell a teacher the lie and it could get out of hand ..

Its obvious that this girl has serious issues and this needs to be sorted out. She is actually seriously bullying you. I would go straight to the headmaster or whatever, and explain that this kid is bullying you, and it that you are really upset etc..they should really take you seriously and put a stop to all of this. I cant actually believe that a kid would be as sad as to make fake msn convos, but she should know that something like this could even get the police involved for cyber-bullying. dont suffer in silence, tell someone you trust, or it will all get out of hand.<br>  goodluck!|`|tUsWZGWsaa	Save all the threats they've sent you, print them off and head to the headteacher's office. The Headteacher will see that this is just a childish attack at you, and the people spreading the rumours will get into trouble, not you. Make sure you do it ASAP, before those girls get there before you and possibly convince the headteacher. Good luck, I hope they learn their lesson!|`|0c30f5fdc0cc17a33e0ba8fe4201b997aa	You need to tell someone at the school about this. This girl is obviously harrassing you, and you need to step up if you ever want it to stop. Go to the principal or to the school counselor. They'll know what to do about it. I'm actually surprised your teacher hasn't done anything about it.|`|YGPKbyUdaa	get her to say it to you on msn by saying things like "I didn't sleep with him" and she will hurl abuse bear with it and then copy & paste the conversation and give it to a headteacher or your parents.|`|caVLeRKXaa	what this girl is doing is ileagle you have to tell your teacher who it is just tell him not to talk to her about it maybey get him to do a topic on it and tell your class how illeagle it is|`|awA3KFsGaa	in addition to telling your head teacher and your parents you should be saving ALL of the msn conversations the girl is sending you!|`|xPkGirrKaa	tell the head principle..print all the things she said..and before she gets to talk you should warn him that she will make up lies and say what she will say|`|jAxYPZWMaa	tell your teacher|`|B9S8Gsxoaa	well i would just ignore them all and rise above it all and when they threaten you  just say and your saying this because .<br>  this once happened to me but not as serious because me and my mate were passing notes saying which teachers we fancied and the teacher she had wrote down caught us and he read it out to the class so everyone knew which teachers we fancied but we didn't get bullied on msn.the best thing to do is to change your msn and only give it to your best friends and people you can trust then just delete your older one. but to stop it in school tell your teacher who has spread it and if they threaten to beat you up after school mension it to your last teacher of the day and ask if you can go home 5 minutes earlier then if they say no walk out of the class and go and talk to another teacher that you trust ask if you can join their lesson then leave 5 minutes earlier. then that might just stamp out the problem.|`|CqnoHNSkaa	If you have any conversations save them and print them out for evidence. Block them on MSN and then report their email address to MSN and also contact the Police - this person can get done for cyber bullying. Also, get a parent or guardian to ring the headteacher and tell them what's going on and ask for a meeting with them and then the other teacher. Hopefully this girl gets put in her place.<br>  For the meantime try not to worry about going back to school. I know its easier said than done but if you think something is going to be bad then it will be. I don't want to go back b/c of things happening but I'm trying to pull myself together in the hope things get better.<br>  At my old school I got on well with some teachers (female) and then my friends made a joke about it but then this lad started to say I was a lesbian and that I was doing all sorts and crap like that.

Bullying is a serious matter, and your school will not take it lightly.<br>  <br>  Don't worry to much.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you tell your parents tonight or tomorrow, and on monday morning go to school with then a wee bit earlier, visit your head teacher.  Or alternatively don't go to school first thing and get your mum to phone your headteacher to make an appointment.<br>  <br>  The most important thing to do when you are being bullied is to make grownups aware of whats going on.|`|vc403uWPaa	The only way you can avoid getting your teacher into a lot of trouble is to go straight to your guidance teacher and tell him everything exactly what's going on. It will be worse if the rumours get to your head teacher and he takes it seriously without knowing all the facts. There will probably be a bit of an investigation, but it's either that or you let this ***** hold it over you for the rest of your time at school! Providing there is no ounce of truth in it, then that's what I would do!

I plan on seeing my doctor on tuesday, so that I can find out what I can take, before this cold drives me crazy.|`|L2IU8kNTaa	congratulations!<br>  I'm assuming you mean you can't breathe through your nose? There are a couple things you can try. First, a Neti Pot: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/neti-pot/AN01755" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/neti-po...</a><br>  This clears your nasal passages using only water or saline. You can also use Saline spray- I used that quite a bit while pregnant because I could NEVER breathe through my nose. I used Breathe Right strips at night which were very helpful. You can also soak a washcloth in hot water and breathe directly into it. Most remedies will only be temporary since what you are experiencing is hormonal swelling. But it could be helpful to try before eating or sleeping. Good luck! :)

O3EtP4vOaa	I do not know how the health care system works in the UK - I am in the US - but you picked a really bad time to have an accident.  You very well could be ovulating right now and could be a very fertile time for you.  I normally have my period on the 4th and ovulate between the 18th and 21st.  I would do whatever you can to get a morning after pill, even if it means telling your parents.  They will be happy you are being pro-active verses having a baby in 9 mths.  If not your parent can you ask an aunt or older sister or bf's older sister or aunt?  If not look up a local family planning clinic.|`|BrERsGEIaa	find your local family planning! you can search for it on the internet and then go down there. they will give u the morning after pill and its totally confidential. i know how you feel as i made a simular mistake when i was 14 (im 18 now) but just remember you got 72 hours to get the pill down your neck but its best taken in  the 1st 48.<br>  <br>  hope everything goes ok sweet|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Unfortunately you chose a very dangerous time to have sex.  Ejaculation isn't actually necessary, it just gives the little sperms a head start.  <br>  <br>  Please see your doctor for birth control.  The morning-after pill is not meant to be used regularly.
H41u0B8Jaa	Your older daughter seems jealous of the baby...you need to make sure she learns it is not acceptable to hurt the baby.  Maybe you can try getting her to help you with the baby so she feels involved and not left out.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You really need to work on your questions.  What age is "2/5" years?  It's natural for a toddler to have some resentment towards a new baby but if she's "cut her fingers" then your older daughter needs to see a child psychologist.
H24DtUKOaa	This is modern America for you. There is a reason a two year old cannot be diagnosed with ADHD - ALL two year olds are bouncing off the walls. You have a normal child.

AA10196172	Generally, that should not matter. In fact, many women have learned the trick of stopping a day or 2 early; or keep those extras and stop a day or 3 later. You can do this if you want to reschedule the monthly visit of "Aunt Flo from Red Bay", so to speak; you know, if you have a big date, or...  maybe that swim meet or horseback riding event.<br>  <br>  Not sure what your pack says. The brand I've read said "if you miss one, take as soon as you remember. Miss 2 or more, use alternate for of birth control for the rest of the pack". So missing that last one should not be a problem, especially if you find that your period starts. I know missing 2 can usually cause a period, once you have done 2 weeks or more of the pack.<br>  <br>  So don't worry.
idPxntyRaa	Congrates for very soon...it wont be long now. ur her mum right...im u will be the first person she calls.<br>  thanks 4 answering my question too..it really helped, made me smile the nervous bit..thats really sweet!<br>  good luck n congrates|`|kxD35uB5aa	i was in labor for 40hours and didnt even get to 2cm until my 30th hour lol...so there is absolutely no way of knowing im sorry|`|M92DlyzDaa	Call her (or her husband) and find out :)|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	She could. You could ring up the hospital to find out!|`|lGcpXteaaa	Maybe, maybe not.<br>  It takes some people more than 24 hours to get from that point. <br>  You will just have to wait and see x|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	If it is her first baby, then I would guess no. Give her at least another 3 hours or so! Especially if she was only 1cm 6 hours ago.
2E9pG4j5aa	wow that is so weird that is the EXACT same schedule my son is on!!  my son is 9 months old but was 3 months premature so he 6 months corrected age. i steamed chicken for him last week and then liquefied it along with veg and potatoes and then added heinz baby gravy and he absolutely loved it!! im going to try pork this week for him. i did try moving him to stage two foods but he wasn't ready. so il try again on a few weeks. i think its a bit soon for finger foods myself but your son may be different. im just afraid a big lump will fall off and he will choke. but you could try adding a pot of yogurt between 2pm and 5pm i sometimes give my son that.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	You can try getting a magic bullet or something like it and start pureeing table food for him. The should give him some meat and starches. Nothing too heavily spiced or chunky, it should be completely pureed.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	u can give toast, and puree meats too
vOFdHvlvaa	I brought everythin for the baby, a few outfits, a hat, some balnkets that kinda stuff.  But i also brought my own diapers and stuff like that, cuz i only wanted to use the pampers swaddlers and the hospital i was at only uses huggies, and i breastfed so i didn't need any formula or bottles.  Basically bring what u wanna bring for ur baby (without goin overboard of course).<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	you need less than you think, we took everything we had and it was way to much, you will just need the stuff for the trip home, i would just say take a coming home outfit and blanket and snowsuit or carseat cover if it is cold where you live, the hospital will supply everything else that you need for your stay from bottles to diapers and blankets.|`|VHs7OPGlaa	It seemed like I packed the whole house with my first child. I packed everything you could think of that comes on a registry list! I just had twins and packed very little. The hospital provides diapers and wipes and clothes for the babies. They provide bottles and formulas if you plan to formula feed. They provide binkies if you choose to use them. They provide soap for the first bath. They provide receiving blankets and spit rags. Basically everything! If I were you, I would just pack clothes and toiletries for you and for baby, you should pack a bringing home outfit and a blanket. Be sure to bring your camcorder or camera for those precious pictures!!! Good Luck and congrats! If you want anymore advise you can email me. snb_316@yahoo.com|`|60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	You just need a nuk (if you want to use one), blanket to go home in, an outfit if you want pictures done, an outfit to go home in (if different than the picture outfit).  And snow suit if needed.<br>  <br>  I was surprised with how much they provided.  They did have onesies for the baby, diapers, vaseline, formula, alcohol swabs and I'm sure much more!|`|g5vQYWrzaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!<br>  A onesy, baby body suit is it cold another warm suit.LIttle hat and a  blanket. The hospital will give diapers, pacifiers, hat.<br>  They don't let you leave without a car seat.|`|ncWigo1Laa	All i needed was a car seat(you cant leave without one) footed jamies, a hat, and a receiving blanket. Remember you'll be going straight home. The hospital i was at gave me a complementary diaper bag with baby things and about a days worth of baby formula.|`|8b23cc22d18997c207d3f0fd28dbd910aa	I agree with the posters above. You don't need much. If you really want to pack one (I understand your excitement), bring a diaper, a burp cloth, a receiving blanket, an outfit to bring her home in, any appropriate outerwear she may need and that's about it.<br>  Congrats on your new arrival!|`|FHT6wsUpaa	I don't really think you need a diaper bag at all. The hospital or birthing center should be able to provide for all of baby's needs. You'll want an outfit to take him/her home in, but other than that, a diaper bag filled with baby items won't be necessary.<br>  <br>  I was glad I had my own toiletries, robes, slippers, toothpaste, etc. I had an emergency c-section and we were in the hospital for longer than I expected.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and congrats.
XR5Ulhztaa	hmm . . . its always nice to hear people talk about a serious problem like a funny joke, hey i'm a transgendered teenager (if you don't believe me look at my profile) and i think its just grand to be confused about my body's gender! grow up will you! and no it's not "normal" to wish to be a man that's a cross dresser, its only normal for this guy> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/xantoniolovelacex" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/xantoniolove...</a>|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	I went out dressed as a guy once (I am a girl, duh).

JVPt99Hxaa	i have no idea but no all 14-15 yr olds want a baby some of us want a life first|`|O8XjkCjxaa	Cause it makes them seem more mature and cooler; as soon as they hit 17 or 18 they instantly want to become younger.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	I agree with Latanian, but her atrocious spelling is giving me a headache.<br>  <br>  Basically, these teens think they're grown up, or they want to fit in ("all my friends have babies, I want one too"). Media also plays a big part. Stars make having babies look glamorous. These girls think a baby is a toy, and that it's really not so hard to take care of a newborn.<br>  And some girls think they're invincible, and won't get pregnant, even though they don't use condoms or take the Pill.<br>  <br>  Most teens do not want babies.<br>  It just happens.<br>  And they have the common sense to not get an abortion.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Because they are being idiots.  Not just about the responsibility involved in having a baby.  But also about the fact, that, having sex when they are not the 'Age of Consent' is Statutory Rape.  But they don't care.  They just want to be popular, instead of using common sense.<br>  <br>  Absolutely pathetic.|`|t7iOijRPaa	its because WE are so in love with our partner,and we cant wait to have a baby. emotionally and physically were ready,but physically were not. i mean,im 19 and pregnant. and i know im going to be an amazing mother and my fiance will be and amazing father|`|o8uGsZxmaa	Not all 14 and 15 year old teens want to have babies you know.|`|cj29AORfaa	for the small percentage that DO want a baby at that age,they don't want a real social life very apparently. I'm 16 now but I was considering having a baby then I thought about it,I want to travel,finish school,go to college,all of that. Pretty much,common sense kicked in and I was over it. I want kids,but not until I'm at least 22. If they would sit down and think about, the majority of them would change their mind ASAP.|`|xeVfE97Caa	For some reason it has become a trend in highschool to be a teen mother. I believe a lot of it has to do with phisical maturation.  Year ago a giril married at 13 and usually had chidren around 14 or 15 years of age. The body is still not completely ready to have a child at that age ( so they say) . Back then we relied on farming and hunting to servive. There was no electric bill, baby formula, Disposable diapers, or any such bills. Therefore, at this age the body was "ready" and the couple was "finacially ready". Today we need to finish our education and get a good job so that we can support our children. We also need to be mature enough to teach them the things they will need to know to servive in todays sociaty.<br>  <br>  Reason teens get pregnant///<br>  <br>  1. A lot of our youth ( at least in my geeration) was abused as a child. This leaves the child to basically rais their self. When this happens you get a feeling that you are already grown up. You have had no one to rely on but yourself and you feel capable of being resposable for a child.<br>  <br>  2. Utter stupidity...." it wont happen to me"  People see bad things happen every day and believe they are immune.<br>  <br>  3. uinvolved parents.... Life is so buisy it is hard to find time to spend with your children. A typical child spends 6 hours at school, 2 to 3 hours watching television, 9  to 10 hours of sleep, 1 to 2 hours on homework, phone calls and internet and about 1hour with their parents in a day. With all of the influences how can one hour with the parents give the child good guidance?<br>  <br>  4. Attention.. Kids seem to think that having a baby will give them a lot of attention when infact it take all the attention they would be getting. Raising a child takes all of your time, money, SLEEP, and patients.<br>  <br>  5. Trend..yes believe it or not "all the other kids are doing it" Goes a long way.<br>  <br>  Back to the first point Teen pregancy is not the way to go. Most teens end up pawning the child off on their parents.<br>  <br>  I was a mother at 17 my daughter is now 10. I raised her with no help from my parents. I got up every 2 hours at night. I paid for her formula clothes diapers doctor bills. I quit school to support her. I wan't able to return to school until I was 24 years old. I wouldn't change it for the world I love my child. However, I also teach her everyday and remind her of how hard it is to rais a child working a minimum wage job.<br>  <br>  You only get to be a child for 18 years...18 years and then it is over. Then you have car payments, student loans, morgage, taxes, grocery bills, electric bills, doctor bills, insurance bills for the house and the car, Don't give up your childhood.There is plenty of time to be an adult.|`|NCvvwPEdaa	Having baby for them is just there kiddinesh. How can u imagine they can handle the situation for bringing up their babies even when they themselves are 1. They just think by having sex and having babies will make them mature and understand the society very well which infact they are not aware of at all. Its just the mentality of how u think. Hope every kid does not think like this.|`|DFuWEy4faa	I think its because we have all these hormones running threw us. I personally would love a baby & I'm 16.

E5CnUdhsaa	choose a time nearest to either breakfast lunch or dinner when when they have a bottle. ie i gave my daughte a bottle at 1pm so i made the bottle from scratch and made the cereal up with some formula and while feeding her solids the bottle had time to cool and was ready for when she was due to get her bottle, give one serving daily until you think your baby is managing ok then add another serving. a cup can be introduced at anytime hne you think your baby is capable. a simple beaker is fine. with a little bit of milk or water inside:) practice makes perfect|`|ROJans2Taa	I just started my 5 1/2 mth old on cereal, I did it in between his bottle feedings, when he was showing interest in what I was eating, I only made 2 tablespoons worth and he enjoyed it immensely, after a week of 1 feeding a day, he is now having 2 servings a day, just follow baby's cue's, best luck|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I would suggest starting the cereal in the morning time. That way if it upsets their tummy you don't end up with a sleepless night. Make sure the cereal is kind of soupy and very thin. Plan for more to come out of their mouth then what actually goes in! I have always mixed mine with a little stage 1 sweet potato's or carrots.<br>  For a cup wait till about 5 or 6 months. make sure you buy the cups with the soft or rubber spouts, not the hard kind. The best cup I have found is the "Nuby" brand that only is available at Walmart. It will take a while to get used to the cup, my 15 month old just got it down in the past few weeks!<br>  Good Luck!|`|Rx4xWsxQaa	make it extra liquid-y at first, and increase thickness slightly with every feeding. then you should be okay to star adding flavor to it. have you tasted it? that cereal is terrible!
YLXpwqceaa	I don't know if you are already doing this, but this is what my husband and I did.<br>  <br>  Your chart looks good by the way, having your guy wait 3 days before having sex on the fertile day.<br>  <br>  The day I was fertile (by test), my husband and I had sex.  When he ejaculated, he held in me for a few seconds.  He then elevated my hips with pillows to let it pool in my cervix, and then I layed like that for about 45 minutes.  We got pregnant the very first try.<br>  <br>  If you've done this, sorry to waste your time, but if you haven't, it definitely worth a shot!<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!|`|06d711c37564584379b1af164dbbe840aa	;-)  Fertility Friend on line..........awesome.

crrK58F4aa	Hi, I've just done some of the things you've been asking about. DH and I are 25, fit and healthy and have been trying for 12 months with 2 m/c's. I went and had an ultra sound and they did the one with the doppler on the tummy, you need a full bladder for that one. Then they did a transvaginal scan which is an internal scan, they use an instrument that looks like a giant dildo with a camera on the end.<br>  <br>  Through these tests they determined the size and volume of my ovaries, check for viable follicles (the things that release eggs) and checked the width of the endometrium wall. They also check the orientation of the uterus, some people have a tilted or bicornate uterus which can make ttc hard. From here they determine if they need to do further tests.<br>  <br>  I didn't pay for my tests as they were covered by my health insurance, but depending on where you live in the world will determine how much you pay or don't pay.<br>  <br>  Generally they don't send you for tests until you have been ttc for 12 or more months or have had 3 mc's.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it all!|`|sk46uigvaa	First of all i would like to say that My husband and i are both 21 years old, we have a 3 year old daughter that was conceived when we had only has sex once in 3 months!!, we have been trying to conceive baby no2 for 3 years now!!<br>  <br>  We have no explanation for it.<br>  you have been trying to conceive for 8 months or so, which isn't very long believe it or not, that's 8 chances providing you ovulated each month! The average couple take 1 year!!<br>  <br>  Im sorry about your miscarriage that must have been devastating!<br>  Most miscarriages happen due to chromosomal defects, your body can reject an embryo if it's abnormal in anyway, chromosomal defects normally occur due to abnormal sperm. Does your partner have a healthy lifestyle?? Do you both have a healthy lifestyle?? ie no drink/drugs/smoking....<br>  <br>  Are you  BOTH taking vitamin supplements??<br>  <br>  I think unless you know you have tried all of these things then fertility testing should happen alot later.<br>  <br>  Fertility testing is free to a certain extent in the UK on the NHS, however if your in the US then you may have to pay.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AND DON'T GIVE UP HOPE!!
A4cBCHKmaa	Does your milk have sufficient fat content? In other words, have you kept yourself slim during your pregnancy, or did you gain 25 to 40 lbs? Your excess weight is turned into butterfat in the milk and makes baby gain weight (and you loose weight). If you have kept the weight off, then there may be insufficient fat in the milk for baby's weight gain. My last daughter's weight was always in the lowest 10%. As she got older (7 or 8) we had to give her Royal Jelly (sort of like super honey) to stimulate her appetite. This should only be done for an infant under a doctor's guidance, and it sounds like she is feeding long enough.

Yes, a baby's weight should be measured monthly not weekly!!!<br>  <br>  Maybe try a different doctor or a naturalist? But definitely don't worry at all about her weight if she's a happy baby. x|`|5i4vUQhgaa	it is common for babies to gain weight slower than others, but is your baby having lots of runny diapers and doesn,t seem satisfied?  if so your baby might be allergic to milk.
5OH4XPaIaa	Actually. Theres three ways to pronounce it<br>  <br>  A-ree-elle<br>  Are-ee-elle<br>  Air-ee-elle<br>  <br>  And of course you can pick the long A or short A sound. So theres a few ways<br>  <br>  I like A-ree-elle. Maybe to avoid confusion you should spell it Arelle or try a different spelling ^^""|`|jC1Mdsefaa	either AIR or ARE **ee L **  that was actually going to be my babies middle name, but changed it to something else.. I was pronouncing it ARE e elle|`|D0y3MwDcaa	R-E-L <br>  Are-EE-L<br>  <br>  it is just a different spelling for Ariel|`|L2Nde54Haa	ah-ree-el|`|PzYQEHmuaa	spelled like that its Arr - ee - elle, which is what you intended.<br>  <br>  if it was to be pronounced the other way it would be ariel. the extra "le" on the end gives it the "elle" ending.|`|tzPEckiZaa	Some people also pronounce it Air-E-el|`|b639f61d656c58882c6d485d251a34e1aa	Arr-ee-elle<br>  <br>  if you want air-ee-elle, then spell it Ariel.<br>  <br>  pretty name either way!|`|SGGgzRtTaa	Ah-ree-elle?|`|fiUF4cAXaa	air-re-el|`|8F2jgbN3aa	Air - eeee - elle|`|z6CBWSnFaa	a-real-ae<br>  <br>  or a-real|`|ElayGlHPaa	R-E-L|`|YEfdJ9K1aa	With that spelling, the emphasis is on the ELLE. Watch the movies Footloose, Grumpy Old Men, Starting Out in the Evening, In America or the tv series Medium for women named Ariel. (for the English pronunciation). I love the name Ariel- it just sounds gorgeous and is meaningful as well. Arielle sounds Hebrew or French to me.|`|HNlLQZbLaa	air-ree-elle<br>  <br>  emphasis unfortunately is not on the "elle" part<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|JazebGv9aa	I think it can be pronounced 2 ways:<br>  R-E-L OR Air-E-L<br>  <br>  Like Ariel, the mermaid from the disney movie.|`|B2gdBCBbaa	Air-EE-el<br>    OR<br>  Air-EE-el-uh|`|7obW4lPVaa	Air-ree-ell|`|r2kWdYkraa	Air-ree-el|`|W6Ewcz4jaa	I would say it more like air-ree-elle|`|PmC0e6e1aa	air-E-elle.|`|hOEIFpl5aa	like the little mermaid!!!!!!! spell it ARIEL like the little mermaid! its prettier that way.|`|gs8MSMs3aa	Air Eee Elle<br>  <br>  oh that helps :)
1tmX7xbRaa	i hate to say this and i'm not getting into the god debate however when it comes right down to facts i think it is mostly genetics... some people can have babies easily and some can't. i know plenty of people who  NEVER take care of themselves (or their bodies) and have gotten pregnant, i also know a few women who take care of themselves as well as they possibly could and can't get pregnant. and i don't think that god has a huge role in the situation because otherwise i don't think there would be as many teen pregnancies not to mention there wouldn't be so many women getting abortions because they don't want their babies while there are so many women who want kids and can't have any.<br>  i would have to believe that god dosent determine who gets pregnant because other wise he would be a cruel man.|`|jeDExMWBaa	Your man has some MAD swimmers is all I have to say! And of course life habits can help when it comes to conceiving and not! But I dont know about it being gods way or not. I am also pro choice to throw that out there for my own reasons. I also feel bad for people who can not conceive but as "religious" folk say.... Its all part of his plan and maybe there is something better he has planned for that person! so there ya go|`|mBXu5G5saa	Absolutely, the wayy you live your life has every thing to do with it..|`|oDUuAs9Raa	It has nothing to with god other than the fact that we were given the "tools" to procreate....the rest is up to us.|`|EQz7DDsEaa	the way you live your life has a lot to do with it but a lot of it has to do with a guy think about it the female is doing her part receiving but the male isn't giving enough or good enough if a man has good quality sperm and high quality then it should happen without many if any problems but guys that cant produce enough or good enough quality (thick warm and about half to a full shot glass worth) then whos fault is it? all women for the most part i mean like 99.99999999% of women have the same organs that do the same thing so if you have a friend whos having trouble with it tell her to blame her husband lol|`|JsaHbd7Paa	Well, if you believe in God and are faithful, then yes it is a gift from God that you are receiving blessed children. If you don't believe in God, then the pregnancy of children are all determined by the body of the women and the ejaculation of the male. Sometimes, the women can get ejaculated and not conceive because her body rejects it.|`|v9x3xGpvaa	Jesus put us on earth to think and do for ourselves.

He loves her and cares for her dearly and it upsets him deeply that he can never have his own child.<br>  <br>  It seems that you hear lots of men & women who you know would make good parents having trouble - but go down your local council estate and there are kids after kids playing in the street with no one that actually gives a s**t.

DVtnf0Zeaa	GOOD LUCK! <br>  <br>  Request a seat on the aisle and the middle.  With any luck, you will have a friendly someone next to you by the window who will let your little one peek over.  But...I can imagine that your 4 year old will likely want to get up and use the bathroom during the 12 hours and the co-passenger may appreciate not having to move each time.  Also, a seat closer to the door means loading and unloading the plane last.  Dont' fall for the little piece about people travelling with children can go first to get organized.  Every moment you can be out of the plane is great! <br>  <br>  Consider a baby sling or front carrier to give yourself 2 free hands.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I know if I were a co-passenger and someone asked me to help by holding an infant, I would gladly oblige.  If there are other Mom's or even Grandmas on the plane, they may be willing to give you a hand while you run that little one to the biffy.  Likewise if you need 2 minutes to go yourself.  Rest assured that they can't be kidnapped 1200 miles in the air.  Don't be afraid to ask either.  Some people don't know how to speak up.  <br>  <br>  Purchase/Borrow or rent a protable DVD player or laptop with that capability.  Let your 4 year old choose movies to bring and choose some he has not seen in a while.  That DVD player can sit on his tray and will entertain him for a long time.  It's best to take those 12 movies you choose and put them in a CD case that accomodates many CD's rather than bringing all of the cases with you.  <br>  <br>  Check out the food options on the flight.  If you have a 4 year old who is a picky eater, he may be awfully hungry after being offered airplane food.  Carefully plan what you are bringing as you have restricitons at the airport for food and beverages in carry on luggage.  Ensure your child has a full belly before boardign the plane and resist urges to give loads of sugar in flight.  Bring snacks like fruit, cheese and meat (lunchables) instead of fruit snacks or candy. <br>  <br>  Check as much baggage as you can and only bring with you things you cannot do without.  You should be able to request a people mover at the gate desk after you land.   It may be helpful to ask a stewardist in advance so one would be there when you land if you have a short time between flights.  If you have a longer lay-over, research the airport you are heading to.  Some now have indoor play areas for kids to get their wiggles out while waiting.  It may be worth heading 5 gates over to check it out.  Also, if you can manage your things without a people mover, do it.  A little moving around rather than a ride may be perfect.  <br>  <br>  When I travelled, I had my husband make an MP3 player (a cheap one we had) of kids songs.  It was amazing.  They think they are really grown up, just be sure it's at a good sound level.  <br>  <br>  Prepare the 4 year old with expectations before getting in the car to the airport, weeks in advance can't hurt.  Let him know of any rewards he will recieve for good behavior.  Also, don't say....if you are not a good boy, you can't have any candy or whatever....this may backfire in desperation. <br>  <br>  Know that you have every right to get up out of your seat and pace a lap or two if the moment is right.  <br>  <br>  Bring any soothy things with you and don't check them.  If you get stranded or loose lugage, a new place with few familiar things from home makes for a tough night.  Don't forget to pack a change of clothes for you too as it is inevitable that your infant will at some point vomit...on you. <br>  <br>  Babies cry.  Don't stress yourself out if yours does while in an airlplane.  I'd like to punch the person who made it a rule that kids should be silent in the company of other people.  It's true that you should make an attempt to soothe her, but be calm about it. <br>  <br>  There is such a drug called Bonine which I believe has a kids version.  If you worry about your 4 year old with motion sickness, try it out before you get on the plane and SOME have adverse affects like making a child hyper.   It's not a horrible thign to do to give it to him and make him a little drowsy.  <br>  <br>  Bring a sippy cup and ask the flight attendant not to crack open the can of juice.  Keep that in your bag to give later if he is not thirsty at that time.  <br>  <br>  If this is your childrens first time on a plane, ASK FOR A FIRST FLIGHT CERTIFICATE.  You'll be glad you did and your kids can likely meet the pilot, even now.  They just do it after the flight.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck! <br>  You will do fine!|`|aa04f7927ab71de6337c1691db125f73aa	***  You are so brave.. <br>         Have plenty of rest before departing ..|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Request a bulkhead seat... a lot of airliners (especially 747s) will have a "crib" attached to the bulkhead that folds down allowing the infant to sleep. Make sure you bring toys and coloring books for the 4 year old and plenty of snacks. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the people mover, be sure to ask the airline staff at the gate upon arrival.|`|5YPSyP91aa	we have to do the same thing sometimes, long haul flights too. it's up to the 4 yr old. if he sits in his seat and is a mild kid you will be ok, but if he is hyper and decides to run all over the plane and then refuses to buckle his belt during landing and has a exorcist style tantrum, then you are in for a living hell :) 4 yrs is pretty old, so i think it will be ok. our 1.5 yr old was hell, and that was w/o an infant.<br>  <br>  one point about bulkhead seating. i think it entices the older child to run around more, because it is so open and easy to get out. regular seating you are kinda locked in behind the seat in front of you, and the kid will just get comfortable watching cartoons, etc. when we had a bulkhead we had a hellish experience, on the return trip we did not have a bulkhead seat and he stayed in his seat most of the time, went more smoothly. in your case though, having an infant, it's nice to be able to put him in the bassinet and have your lap free. pros and cons to each way in your case.
aa04f7927ab71de6337c1691db125f73aa	There is Formula to any pharmacy. Don't give up breastfeeding..eat more soups. Try not to drink/eat acid foods, it makes the milk undrinkable for your baby.|`|IGcS9K62aa	If your son isn't taking your breast nor getting enough milk from it, you need to do everything you can to make sure he is getting enough food. You don't want him to starve. If you have to give him formula do that. I suggest you take him to the doctor though. If its a sudden change it can signal a problem. Plus you could probably explain what is going on to the doctor better than you could to people online. Either way.. it is REALLY IMPORTANT that he gets enough to eat!!!!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	You could try these two products to increase your milk supply. I've had success with them both.<br>  <a href="http://www.healthyapproachmarket.com/shop/product_view.asp?id=83400&StoreID=67DABE329C6F48829A09CD9AB0A0C044&private_product=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthyapproachmarket.com/sho...</a><br>  <a href="http://traditionalmedicinals.com/womens_teas/product/29" rel="nofollow">http://traditionalmedicinals.com/womens_...</a>|`|OUbgs89taa	If your stressed about it maybe you should formula feed him. My first son was formula feed and he took to it very well. <br>  <br>  Do you breast feed or pump? If you breast feed, maybe you could try pumping and giving it to him in a bottle. you could also suppliment with formula if you feel you dont have enough milk being produced.<br>  <br>  Remember to relax at feeding time. He will be able to sense when you are stressed and worried.<br>  <br>  To increase your breast milk, try expressing your milk between feeds to increase supply.|`|Dx2ayijwaa	I know this is scary, I'm sorry. I would probably switch to formula for one feeding and sort of feel whether or not he eats better. I know breast milk has antibodies for the immune system and is overall better for there digestive systems, but breast milk has also shown a decrease of vitamins and minerals needed for baby's development. He needs to eat!|`|0509a790fe9f326fe979c75e17a81017aa	If he's not getting enough breast milk; you need to feed him by the bottle.  It is VERY important for him to get enough.  Does his doctor know what's going on?  If not, he needs to know immediately.  I hope you do have a baby doctor.<br>  <br>  Your spelling is not clear; as to what you mean.  talkin  do you mean taking?

It happens to me all the time. Have you heard of ESP? (Extra Sensory Perception) There are 4 types. Telepathy- Can read minds; communicating with another without using your mouth.<br>  <br>       Clairvoyance  - The word clairvoyance means "clear-sighted" and is sometimes called "remote viewing."  It is the obtaining of information about events in a remote location that is beyond the capability of normal senses. An example of this would be feeling like a a relative was just in car wreck and it turned out to be true.<br>  <br>       Precognition  - Precognition means prior or previous knowledge.  It is the obtaining of knowledge or a vision about an event before it occurs.<br>  <br>       Telekinesis  -  Also called psychokinesis (PK), is the ability to move objects using only mental influence.  Put simply, mind over matter.  This ability was made famous by Uri Geller and his spoon bending.<br>  <br>  I have ESP though. I have precognition, I've been tested for it actually, and it turns out I have a special gift. I'd either want Telekinesis or the one I have. Telekinesis is cool though. <br>  <br>  Or you just may have DejaVu.
lTDeZ0Obaa	I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with all the fertility drugs...is CD 42 a fertility drug that you are on or an abbreviation for something else I am not understanding? <br>  <br>  Anyway, as far as ovulation, it is very frustrating to figure out when you don't have a regular cycle. I am so jealous of my "oh, mine comes every 28 days like clockwork" friends...I've never been so lucky. We are going to be starting to try ourselves in the next couple months, so in preparation I went to the store and bought an ovulation predictor kit. I don't know how accurate they are, but I've heard that they are fairly accurate and do help predict ovulation.

They tell you exactly when you ovulate, making it pretty easy to conceive.  I've had a similarl problem.  Had a miscarriage 3 months ago, then had two normal periods.  In January my period stopped, then I started bleeding again a week later -- and the bleeding lasted two weeks.  My doctor said that sometimes you'll just have a cycle in which you don't ovulate at all and said I had what's called "anovulatory bleeding" -- irregular bleeding without ovulating.  She felt sure it would correct itself, and it did.  I finally stopped bleeding last Thursday and ovulated this weekend.  Sometimes it's just hard to predict.  Which is really frustrating when trying to conceive!  I hope yours goes away like mine did.  Good luck!|`|hr24wI0daa	When you are irregular it is hard to tell. In fact some women who are irregular can't get pregnant. You might want to check with your doctor and see if they can't do something to get your cycle more regular. It will help alot!|`|lY2XI8kUaa	have you thought about buying an ovulation test? they sell them at walmart, they are a bit expensive though.|`|oHNrktxTaa	It seems that your cycle can vary month to month & is not regular. I suggest using the Clear Blue Easy Digital OPK sticks. My husband & I have been trying to conceive the past few months as well. I have been using the OPK's. <br>  <br>  It is very easy to use & unlike the ones with the lines & comparing colors, these are either a O or a smiley:) <br>  The OPK will help determine your LH (lutenizing hormone) surge prior to ovulation. When it picks up your positive surge, you have 24-48 hours to TTC. It will help to increase your chances on becoming pregnant. <br>  You might want to use them since your cycle can be off at times.<br>  <br>  BEST OF LUCK & BABY DUST!!!!

Cx5Zo7IIaa	You could try dill, fennel or caraway tea. It's the same stuff in gripe water and if you have any on hand it's a better option than running out to the store this late. A couple teaspoons of tea should work, use a dropper or syringe, if he is crying while you are doing this blow in his face it will make him swallow. Also try laying him belly down on your lap raise him head then his bottom while patting, if it's gas in the stomach it might help it come out or lifting his rump and patting might make it come out from that end.|`|1hciyvKdaa	The laying on your lap and patting their back helps alot. There is also a technique of sittng baby on your lap sitting, and bow the baby over a little bit, its called Buddahs burp, and that can bring up a burp too.

ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	the cervix is always open when you are not pregnant, how do you thing the little wigglers got to the egg?  During pregnancy a mucous plug forms and prevents any loss of fluid or blood, usually about two days before labor begins the mucous plug will come out, just looks like increased discharge, and the cervix begins to thin and stretch.  Usually the cervix will open to two or three centimeters before you even begin labor, this is so the water can escape when the membrane around the fetus breaks.  Gestation for a human being is around nine months, it is how we are designed, so to put it simply, yes the body knows.|`|npWGkuwnaa	It's all hormonal!|`|veeC7Rvvaa	the pressure of the baby's head when it starts positioning itself to get out dilutes the cervix centimeter by centimeter.|`|AA10900379	I believe, the pressure of the baby's head helps in some way.<br>  Though, I've not had a baby myself.
YuqTcSSDaa	Your period could be late or your days could be off. If your period is always on time, i would be concerened. Usually, if a test comes up negative, either you are NOT pregnant or you are too soon to test. If you actually are 6 days late, you could just be late. Try a more sensitive test. Clear blue easy, for example, can test before you even miss your period. Tests that can tell before your missed period can detect smaller traces of the HCG/pregnancy hormone. Some generic brands cannot pick up small amounts of hormones.|`|3VSuyjeGaa	It's possible.  I would wait a week then test again.  My test came back negative on a wed and on sat I tested again and got a positive.  I just knew I was pregnant regardless of what the test said (this was my 3rd pregnancy though).  If you haven't got your period in a week, test again.  If that comes back negative call the dr and get bloodwork done.  Good luck!|`|xajnJSDLaa	try taking another at home test.<br>  but, your better off making an<br>  appointment at your doctor.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  hope all goes well,<br>  marissa.|`|KWPnoqGMaa	you an be pregnant unless your periods are irregular...if there not you should go to the doctor and get a pregnancy test they are more accurate..<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK..<br>  <br>  5 WEEKS pregnant first child|`|CrKox2niaa	Those are definitely signs you might be pregnant.

KDb96QS7aa	Here are my suggestions:<br>  1. Check your diet - is it associated with dairy (most common cause of diet-related colic)? Eliminate high protein dairy products.<br>  2. Swaddle tight like another said.<br>  3. Try some acidophilus powder (crush a tablet and rub a little on your nipple once a day before bf-ing) ...and of course double check with ped it's okay<br>  4. Like another said, wear a sling. I liked the infantino one. Got bad reviews at BRU, but was a lifesaver for me.<br>  5. Is it possible you have an overactive let-down or oversupply? This can cause a different kind of lactose intolerance from a foremilk/hindmilk imbalance.<br>  6. Some people say different holds (like laying baby tummy down across your forearm) and massages help though they didn't for me.<br>  7. Try letting her sleep just a little while on her tummy while you're right there watching - the pressure can work some of the gas out and when you leave you can flip her to her back.<br>  8. Some consider it risky, but I also found a sleep positioner was very helpful to place him on his side.<br>  Good luck and good job continuing nursing!|`|5EFc1QYbaa	Newborns don't develop colic this early.

They also say you can do like a bicycle movement with there legs and it relieves the gas build up. Warm clothes on the tummy helped. And some babies just want to be held during this. I know what your going through so hang in there and she will out grow it.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My baby was labeled "colicky", but we found out she had acid reflux.  There are some ways to tell what it is.  If she cries when you lay her on her back more than on her tummy or at an angle, like in a bouncer, or she spits up a lot, or gets fussy soon after eating, it could be acid reflux.  Try putting her to sleep in a papasan chair, or elevating one side of her mattress.  We would swaddle our baby and put the boppy pillow under her to elevate her.  Also, keep her upright for about 30 minutes after eating.<br>  If she gets fussy at a certain time of day, it is probably colic.  Most babies have a "fussy period", that lasts for an a hour or two each day.  <br>  It could also be a dairy sensitivity.  My baby had that.  Try cutting dairy out of your diet for a few weeks.  If you see an improvement after a week, then that could be it.<br>  Good luck!|`|uSeApMt9aa	Congrats. Me and my girlfriend just had a baby also. We thought the same thing after a couple days but three weeks later she stopped. Write down all your feedings for a couple days and show the pediatrics your feeding habits. It turns out we weren't feeding her enough. Now with the right amount of feedings she has stopped. Recommended by our pediatric is 4 Oz every 4 hours for formula. And every 2 hours for breast feeding. Your baby may also not be getting fed properly by your breast since its hard to measure. You should set an appt and have her weighed before and after a breast feeding to see if she is getting adequate feedings.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Get a book about how to deal with it and lots of support. A sling can be really helpful to colicky babies because it mimics the feeling of the womb and your walking motion will be familiar. There are different ways of holding your baby that can ease colic. I know in The Baby Book by Dr Sears there are a lot of suggestions on how to deal with it. Congrats on breastfeeding, it would probably be much worse if you were using formula. Make sure you find someone who can give you breaks every now and then so you can take a nap or just get out of the house as having a colicky baby can be very stressful! Good luck|`|GNLYxY7kaa	Well hopefully it is just a belly ache that will subside soon. If not, my heart goes out to you and the babe! Colic is noooooo joke. My son had colic the first 5 months of his life and it was a pure nightmare. We tried every bottle out there that swore to help...different formulas...gas drops...the works. Anyway, what worked for me as a stay at home mom was: similac sensitive rs formula, vent aire bottles, gas drops after he ate then adequate burping...then of course he was still miserable after all the precautions we took SO in order to comfort him I would walk around holding/bouncing him (always worked but is very exhausting because he would not let me sit and do this) and the very best way to calm them down and get a break in for yourself is to lay in a warm bath with them....you just lay the baby's top portion on your lap area and let them relax. Or of course you could just let them lay in their little tub and sit there with them...get some silence. Good luck and God bless.|`|rZLctXwdaa	If she's only a few days old, I can assure you, it isn't colic. It's probably just a tummy ache. I would talk to her doctor, and see if he recommends anything. It might just be gas, so gas drops may do the trick.

KSUPtqCaaa	I helped my friend potty train her four year old son (actually, the week before his fourth birthday). I really sunk to a new low, but it worked quite well.<br>  <br>  Get a cool toy, like a remote control car or truck, or something else she really, really likes, and then play with it. Laugh, have fun, and basically make her really jealous. Like most preschoolers, she will want to join in...<br>  <br>  But then tell her that it is against the rules for her to play with it if she is still in diapers. Tell her she has to have on dry, clean panties for her to be allowed to play with it.<br>  <br>  It only took a day, but my friends son was completely potty trained (day and night). Just like that.<br>  <br>  Another idea might be to get in touch with a local preschool and ask for their help. Sometimes, having peer pressure to potty train will move her along faster than anything else.<br>  <br>  In both of these scenario's, she is making the conscious decision to train, you are just facilitating the process.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can teach her to change her own diaper and let her go... I've yet to see someone graduate High School in Pampers - she will do it eventually whether you intervene or not.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	By what you are saying, she refuses to use the toilet I am assuming that you tell her to and she basically either says no, or doesn't want to be bothered with the inconvenience (for some kids it's just easier to go in a diaper than have to stop what your doing and use the bathroom). It seems to me if she is refusing to use it she is making a choice - it's different from having an accident, or having a physical problem that makes her unable to use the toilet. <br>  If it were me I'd tell her, "it's time to be done with diapers - starting tomorrow morning we are done putting diapers on you" - see what she says, if she is willing but has accidents then something might be wrong - if she's just flat out refusing then she is being disobedient and needs consequences for her actions. I would make her clean up any mess she makes by not using the toilet.|`|io0QtYYtaa	maybe its about control. that is the one thing she thinks that she can control. she is testing you and wants to be independent. maybe you can try reasoning with her like an adult, i know that's crazy but it really works with my niece and nephew to be talked to like adults, maybe tell her if she starts using the potty she can make some decisions. like how to set up her room or what she wants to wear or what the family is going to eat for dinner that night. right now she is just fighting for some control over something. almost like how a dog will show its dominance by peeing on the rug right in front of you, looking right at you. kids and dogs are very similar. she has a personality all her own, and this is the only she has that she can 100% control. sit her down, talk to her reason with her, come up with a deal.|`|5i8rtlmXaa	try getting her more involved with other children her age who are trained and let her see she can do it and it may be mean but if the other kids call her baby a few times just  might do the trick.|`|PdW09cmOaa	Try and make the whole experince fun for her.Then be sure to reward her and she will for sure want to go again.|`|V7sfV5odaa	I have twins who are almost 9.  They both have disabilities. One son is autistic.  I took a course last summer on Potty Training.  Here is what they told me.  Hope it helps. <br>  <br>  >>> Yes it worked for us, finally!!!!<br>  <br>  Check for readiness - There are many checklists for toilet training readiness (see below). I would recommend looking for the following: awareness that he or she has wet or soiled and/or a desire to remove the wet or soiled diaper (pulling at it, taking it off, digging in it, vocalizing displeasure, getting a clean diaper, taking you to the bathroom or changing area); ability to imitate actions (at least some actions); responds favorably to some form of positive reinforcement (a behavior increases after you reward it with something the child likes); and stays dry/clean most nights. <br>  <br>  5. Know your child's routine - Spend at least one week charting the times of day your child eats, drinks, wets, soils, gets changed (with results), and sleeps. Use a day planner, chart (some of the links below have good charts) or simply write down each item and the time it occurs in a log. For example: <br>  6:00am - change diaper - dry <br>  6:15am - drink 1 cup juice <br>  6:30am - ate cereal, toast - drink 1 cup milk <br>  6:40am - change diaper - wet & soiled <br>  At the end of the week look at the data (or log) and see if you see can pick out some general patterns of toileting. For example: He soils 30 minutes after every meal or he wets 10 minutes after drinking his juice, etc. These times can then be built into your toilet training procedures you are about to set up. (Oh yes, you are!). <br>  <br>  6. Find several reinforcers (things your child would do anything for) - Reinforcers may be special food treats (M&M's, Smarties, Cereal bits, raisins, etc.); special drinks (Yoo-Hoo, soda, Koolaid, juices); special toys (cars, dolls, balls, blocks, McDonald's toys, action figures, etc.); or other items that your child loves. Make a rule with everyone that has contact with your child that these special reinforcers will be used only for toilet training rewards. The items will forever be know as: "Potty candy" or "Potty toys." This may produce neurotic behavior in the future but we'll worry about that later - just kidding! <br>  <br>  7. No punishment - Make a rule with everyone that has contact with your child that that toilet accidents are not be be punished. Instead, if a toilet accident occurs use it to associate the toilet with wetting or soiling. Matter-of-factly, without anger or emotion say, "You are wet (or soiled, or had a boo-boo, or had a BM). Big boys (or girls) do that on the potty (or toilet)." If you can, without a tantrum, lead the child to the toilet and sit him or her on the toilet or potty chair once the diaper or training pants (my preference) are off. Immediately reward your child for sitting on the toilet or potty and say, "Good pottying!" or "Big boy (or girl)! Sitting on the potty!" (or something similar that is reinforcing for your child). If your child dislikes the toilet or sitting on the toilet, you will have to "shape" his or her behavior so he or she associates the toilet with the reinforcement. Shaping is a step-by-step process that reinforces a child for getting closer and closer to the behavior goal. For example: Reward the child for coming into the bathroom, then going near the toilet, then sitting on the closed toilet, then sitting on the open toilet, then sitting for five seconds, then for wetting on the toilet, and finally for the "grand-daddy" of them all: having a bowel movement on the toilet! <br>  <br>  8. Use positive reinforcement for appropriate toileting behavior - Use the reinforcers you have identified and save them for toileting. Make sure everyone who has contact with your child is aware of your method and means of reinforcement. If you were able to devote a week to toilet training your child, use a schedule (based upon the information you gathered from charting his or her toileting activity) to provide many opportunities for your child to use the toilet or potty chair. Begin reinforcing each attempt at toileting by giving the reinforcer (food or drink treat, time with a favorite toy, etc.) after the child does what is expected of him or her. You may have to "shape" this behavior by reinforcing the child in steps that lead to the complete behavior. For example: at first the child is rewarded for going in the bathroom, then for pulling down pants, then for sitting, then for urinating, then for having a bowel movement, etc. Once a child has mastered one step, move on to the next and do not reward the first step as much. Always give verbal praise as you give the special treat or toy (the verbal praise will begin to take on the reinforcing powers of the treat and, eventually, you can give verbal praise only). Continue with this method until the child has mastered the steps. The links below will go into even greater detail (see the TEACCH link for a great procedure). <br>  A special note: Some  children  may have u
AA11735666	I understand your question!  My aunt has 5 kids, so each year, at income tax time, they get 5,000, or more, and they buy them a lot!  Then, they do buy for the kids, like game systems, but then, when all their money is gone, they take what they bought the kids, and pawn it so they can get money for marijuana!  It's sickening I know!  We've called child protection services on them but they are dumb, and call to let them know they are coming, and as long as there's a pack of bologna, and some bread, and they have water, they let it go.  But them poor kids have to have no electricity half the time, and I feel so bad for them!  SO, yeah, I understand what you're saying.  I'm on welfare, but I'm 19, my fiance's 20, and our baby is 6 months old, and her daddy only makes about $600.00 every other week!  SO, I don't feel bad at all for being on welfare.  Before I got pregnant, I worked, and I paid my taxes!  And my fiance pays his, so we deserve to get help if we need it.  We haven't got our income tax $ yet, but when we do, we sure as hell aren't spending it on ourselves!|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	its wrong.. you need to report her because think about it.. her kids are getting nothing and your paying your taxes so she can get that stuff.<br>  tell the government that this person is doing it and you want to be named anoymos and you think it would be a good idea if she was given vouchers for food or clothes or stuff like that..|`|xSfgrdFJaa	thats gross, id report them to the social, the kids must be malnourished if they get no money spent on them.

I've always said its a shame that its easier "get" a kid than a dog!<br>  <br>  I just think it's wrong when people use and abuse the system. Welfare exists to help people--not to cater to their wants. Not just that, but I'm sure the kids probably have needs that take priority over a big screen TV and digital camera. I guess that's what makes me the angriest!|`|bYU77eteaa	It's wrong...but people on welfare aren't always too lazy to get a job.  It's hard to find a job out here especially if you live in the inner city.  There are thousands of people competing for the same lame *** job.

I dont agree on the time that you can get an abortion...i think it should have to be done by 8wks.

Everyone has a different view on this subject and they have that right to be entitled to their opionion. So if you dont believe in it...so be it, dont have an abortion...carry on with your day. You dont have to live with quilt, depression etc.
qYEsg4bhaa	Yes. They can be. If you're planning on painting your house, and you use sugar soap, wear gloves. Because that's harmful in pregnancy too. I found out when i was pregnant.<br>  <br>  My partner and i were painting our house ready for bubs, and we got taubmans paints. They didn't smell too much, until we painted the nursery. I wasn't allowed in the room while the paint was wet because of the fumes.<br>  Get your partner to do the painting, or wear a paint mask. I think you can get them from your local hardware store. (it has to be more substatial than a dust mask.)<br>  Or, you could talk to a service rep in the paint store and ask what low fume paints there are, and pick your colours in that brand. They'll always be similar to other brands anyway.|`|AA10394915	Yeah, they say to stay away from paint fumes when your pregnant, but my mom painted when she was pregnant with my older brother.

xo0wxQXBaa	My 5 month old has had 2 doses of the oral vaccine with no side effects. The older version of the vaccine was taken off the market before due to the adverse side effects and we are seeing many, many cases of rota virus in the pediatric hospital that I work from the kids in this age group who did not get the vaccine. I would definately recommend the vaccine as the virus is very easily spread and not easy on their little bodies.|`|CJkrXeDgaa	my daughter didn't have any adverse reaction to the vaccine.

I don't think diahrrea is something to vaccinate against, and the vaccine doesn't work anyways since 95 percent of kids get rota despite being vaccinated<br>  <br>  I am very wary of the rotavirus vaccine co-inventor Paul Offitt, he minimizes vaccine safety issues and has made ludicris comments like 10,000 vaccines wouldn't cause any harm|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	don't vacinate<br>  My oldest now 20, caught it after going to a Chucke Disease Pizza party, when he was 3, he spent 5 days in the hospital get rehydrated after blowing out both ends for a couple of days
U1lmbP7kaa	ummm can`t say, I don`t know her.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I don't know her personally so I can't say if I like her or not. I can say however I don't like her life choices from what I have heard in the media.|`|lGSUToFQaa	no you she doesn't care about her kids or she wouldn't have had more|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	NO<br>  any woman who already has six kids, no husband and no real source of income has no business having more kids in the first place.<br>  <br>  also, humans are not MEANT to have litters of children.  A pregnancy of one is the norm and allows the fetus to develop to the optimal range of gestation.  It is practically unknown for even twins to go full-term.  None of those 8 babies had even reached a birth weight of 4 pounds.  The were all born prematurely, so they have to be kept in the hospital at least a month.<br>  <br>  and now it seems like this is all going to be at taxpayers' expense, which is a crime against society as well as child-abuse for deliberately trying to carry 8 fetuses.|`|t0mb150gaa	I can't say i don't like her because i don't know her but i defiantly do not agree with the choices she has made. Having 8 children when you already have 6 while on government assistance is not right and noone should be supporting what she has done or chosen. If you can financially support that many children then by all means have as many as you like but she can't and the government shouldn't have to!|`|cDVAEHgCaa	I don't personally know her, and if I did, I don't think I'd dislike her.  Yea, she did a dumb thing, but we ALL do dumb things.  I'd be a hypocrite to criticize her.  I'm sure she's a good mom with a big heart.|`|1hciyvKdaa	6 *3 are life diababled, then had 8 more, no, not at all. Do the math, how much time can she spend with them holding each for 30 mins to feed one bottle. Not enough time.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	I pity her. No well balanced person would ever do what she did !!!|`|UghJ0XROaa	I never met her!|`|Hl7OvXruaa	no.. and thats all that need to be said.. case closed|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yea she seems like a pretty nice person to me, course i don't actually know her so it's kinda hard to tell, i'm only basinn it off of the couple of interviews i've seen with her.<br>  All her kids are so cute, esp. the octuplets, but her 6 older kids are cute too.|`|hZVJRW7uaa	You mean personality wise?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't know, she seems just like every other person I see on the news.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I don't know her personally, but I don't like the actions that she's taken from what I've read and learned|`|0NwZPBgQaa	not really...she wasnt really smart about the whole situation...u know the whole getting pregnant again with a housefull of children already and no job!!!! so my answer is no!!!|`|nhgQKvwEaa	OLD NEWS!|`|QpUHH1xQaa	That is so dirty to & take a chance on bringing another autistic child into this world. These kids don't diserve this. She alread has three out of six that are disabled, so that is one selfish bitxch to take a chance on half of these kids either having autism- or many forms of severe brain disfunction.... Just so she can get attention & let hard working people take care of them along with her mother that she's has worn out. Something needs to be done since she had these eggs implanted & the chances of them being disabled is beyond high. This girl needs to be stopped & my God I have seen the hell that the parenets with just one kid with autism go through & there is noway on this planet this sick girl could ever take care of these kids the right way or afford to get one of them real help so that they could live a real life. This isn't being mean but these kids need to be given to some family that can afford them that can give them attention there are tons of women that would give anything for just one child. I don't mean to keep on but this makes me sick & I'd like to rip those fake lips off that witch for bringing children into this world that will suffer.|`|5MFBoWSAaa	Why not? Like, what did she do to us? I think it's stupid that people that don't even know her are judging her.|`|LSmPH2usaa	It's not that I don't like her, I don't know her but I would think she has some serious psychological issues if she has that many kids and thinks she can do it all by herself with her mother in a 3 bedroom bungalow. I hate to see what she is like   when they all come home and she has to store them in the closet because she has not room for them.|`|TczFL0p0aa	first off i do not know her so i cannot say weather or not i like her.<br>  secondly i'd like to say let's not judge someone who we only THINK we know we don't KNOW we know cause you do not know her you only know what you've heard, and words from the tabloids (as we know) aren't always correct, I want to believe what she has said as far as not being a celebrity and not liking all the attention. I chose not to believe that she wants to look like Angelina Jolie cause I just don't think it's true, if in fact it is true then yes maybe she does need help. I have no problem with someone loving children, and I know the feeling of "baby fever" but i do have a problem with people who do things when they cannot afford them especially when there are other people's lives (in this case very much) affected.<br>  my heart goes out to those children who's only a few of the people who's lives will be affected by this.<br>  as for the mother stop hating people you don't have the slightest clue, and all i have to say to those dumba/s/ses who leave rude, mean and unnecessary messages to Nadia her self and her PR is ha! to you cause now you will be charged for it.<br>  good luck to Nadia, her parents and her 14 children!<br>  and to you Americans who have to pay for her choices, im canadian so aha lucky me!|`|FszxeECvaa	nope|`|1B91qtNQaa	No. She spent 1000's and 1000's of dollars on IVF but can't afford to feed the kids she has. That is irresponsible! I have no problem with how many kids a person wants to have as long as they have the means to take care of them. Yes children need love and affection but they also need shelter, food and clothes.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I am not goin to say yes or no bc i dnt knw her personaly but i think it was selfish to have cosmetic surgery & not being able to pay for her kids before i would go pay to get a nose job i think i would buy my children something & or try to make a better future for them..|`|28QPS6V9aa	Well I'm sure nobody on here know's her personally so nobody can give a fair answer! We only know what the media tells us! But from what I've heard of her, I don't agree with the decison she made but I still want to give her my love and support. She's still a person with  feelings and we need to remember that!|`|60052eab38f27341cc86e1493496f261aa	From what I've heard, I don't think she made the right decision for her family that she states that she desperately loves so much|`|00sn8G9paa	She and people like her are a big reason there is a big gap between our gross pay and net pay. She ought to be flogged and taught responsibility.|`|VFCdX4Rfaa	no...how is she gonna support these kids? who the hell is gonna baby sit 14kids when she go to work?|`|HCaAUig4aa	no, its gross hom many kids shes had, she should get them takin away....|`|AA11435162	I don't know her, but I defintely think she has a problem.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I don't know her.|`|hJ5lQXehaa	No.|`|Amf1wtJmaa	I think she's off her rocker|`|4vDPfZA9aa	I don't think she made good decision, but I am not going to judge her and criticize her. Everyone makes mistakes, of course some worse than others.
xue72D76aa	I think women have the babies for a reason.  A lot of men are babies when it comes to not feeling well.  When they get sick, it is as if their whole world falls apart.  They are irritable and can hardly function.  Now, take that mentality and add 40-42 weeks of pregnancy with the aches and pains, morning sickness, hormones...  Men would fall apart.|`|vXR5L8Jfaa	Wow. How typical. Look, I know for a fact that all the men around me cannot handle any kind of pain. If you can't handle being sick and just ***** about it, what makes you think you could handle having a period and giving birth? Our population would have ended years ago if men were the ones having babies. And please have some respect for women, men are not dominant, men and women have different strengths and weaknesses. Seriously, learn some respect. And btw, you're not going to get so many nice comments from us females if you try telling us you're more dominant than us.|`|AA11849364	"Since Men are the more stronger, dominant sex, I think we should be the ones to endure the horrible, terrible, physical pain of giving birth to a baby"<br>  Lol, don't be sexist, Andrew.  You know how old I am^_^, I let you know, and I have seen your pic. If we had to" battle" physically, I can take you ( I'm an experienced "scrapper" even though I don't like to fight). It takes more than physical strength to have a baby. There are some women out there who shouldn't have a pet, let alone a child. I know what you mean though about women wanting a man to defend them...I haven't found one I could trust yet. I use to stand up against criminals when I was married( my ex- husband had friends who were ex cons, more than one a killer who got away with it...they said it was"self defense"). I have also stood up to cops, which is a bad thing to do, and I suggest one not do it, but I got away with it because I was "right".|`|nUUX3VMIaa	I agree to the fact that I would like Men to have children, but it is bull sh** that Men are the dominant. <br>  Men couldn't handle the EMOTIONAL aspect of nurturing the young. We aren't all penguins here, Women are much more emotionally stable and balancing, Women have much more control over their feelings and seek many alternatives to situations, unlike Men. <br>  <br>  But it would be nice for you Men to feel our pain once in a while.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Are you kidding? My husband is a complete SOOK when he's not well. It WOULDN'T be better because we'd have to put up with all of the whining that went along with it!<br>  Women are a lot stronger than you give us credit for I think.|`|Y1e66CPvaa	women need to have some responsibilty|`|RzYePezkaa	Men could not stand the pain of labor or the bleeding of periods for that matter and behind every strong man is  a strong woman.We have it just as hard we have to fight to get respect in the workplace hell we had to fight to be able to work,vote and drive a car.Men aren't always the strong ones without women they aren't we cook,clean take care of babies and our husbands who  mind you whine more then any woman or child.The world is fine the way it is with women having the babies instead however if you really want to know what we go through when pregnant put on one of those pregnant suits and tell us if men can handle a bowling ball in their gut.|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	I believe women should The the ones having the baby|`|IjOEpqgOaa	I mean think about it... A woman brought you into this world?<br>  Give us women some respect... <br>  <br>  <br>  YOU men have no clue what giving birth is like!

I have always been the one to take care <br>  if it all. I agree that men could not handle being pregnant<br>  or childbirth. To say that men are dominant to me is a <br>  joke. If you ever want to find someone you need to rethink<br>  your mindset. Just because you have to fight tooth and nail<br>  for a date doesn't mean other men do. There is a reason!|`|qaoIdRSZaa	your a typical male!! <br>  pig headed and arrogant!!<br>  what kind of women have you been dating anyway?<br>  you should be embarrassed HAHAHA
OydLOXgJaa	Yikes. First off, I am SO sorry you're having such a hard pregnancy! I can feel your pain, but I'm at least not throwing up like that *knocks on wood*... Just have my own set of medical issues. Heh. <br>  I am glad you're going to call your Dr, cuz they will have the best information for you... but I also know how important it is to get reassurance! So, I will let you know that I have passed out several times since I've been pregnant, and my midwives and main Dr aren't too worried about it. They said that the only real danger of it is where/when I pass out! (Don't want to fall and hit your tummy or your head etc, or be in the middle of a parking lot!)<br>  However, they have done lots of blood work and other tests on me to make sure everything is normal. From what I've heard, this can occasionally be a normal (but annoying) pregnancy symptom. Obviously if you are STAYING unconcioius, that is a whole different ball game! I am only out for a few seconds at a time, so it doesn't cut off any oxygen to the baby or anything. Also though, I had low blood pressure off and on before I was pregnant, and would occasionally faint because of it... it has just gotten a lot worse since I've conceived, and I sometimes have to lay down on my left side for an hour or more before it passes. (Try the left side thing, it actually does seem to help... it just takes a bit some of the time. Also, make sure you are staying hydrated enough with all that throwing up! If you're not, talk with your Dr and maybe have them start an IV for ya... it can seriously help your blood pressure, and isn't that big of a deal for them to do when needed.)<br>  Anyhow, definitely follow up with your Dr, but hopefully there is nothing to worry about for you as well, and this is just a bump in the road in this crazy (but wonderful) journey!   :)<br>  Good luck to you girly, I hope that all turns out great for you, and that you start to feel better in general soon!!! You poor dear! Take good care.|`|ZjcH929kaa	Make sure you are not suffering from hypertension, or HEELP syndrome. these are common signs for these.|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	call your doctor but its probable bcuz of all the fluid u lost while throwing up so much
JTO49rdIaa	If it's bothering you that much, you may as well come clean to your boyfriend- but it's been ten months now and unless you are considering cheating on him it shouldn't be an issue. I say let the past be past in this situations... unless it's bothering you that much. In that case, get it off your chest.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	just dont tell him, its in the past so leave it in the past|`|uiab8KVjaa	I dont think you should tell him, because you wernt 'really' going out with him at that time were you!!!<br>  leave it where it is. and no one will get hurt xx|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Leave the past in the past.<br>  Sometimes you need to think about if it will be better for him to know or not.<br>  And in this instance this'll just hurt him, What he doesnt know cant hurt him.<br>  Just dont do it again, Unless your prepared to tell him.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped :)|`|IH0kLuwZaa	don't mention it!! i'm telling you all it does is cause problems and its not worth the trouble for something that meant nothing|`|ePmfKrFMaa	yea some things are just better left in the past.
23C49tEOaa	What do you mean by freezer burn? A collection of ice? Is it just on the outside of the package or is actually on the breastmilk?  If it is on the outside, I would suggest that it is ok.  Breast milk is good in a regular standing freezer (on top of the fridge) for three months and six months in a deep freezer when stored correctly.  How old is the breastmilk?|`|A9j7ahwsaa	don't risk it, he is too precious to take a chance i breastfed 3 children and never froze milk. fresh is best but everyones circumstances are different i suppose.|`|dpig5odPaa	I don't think so. I would throw it out. You can call the lactation consultant at the hospital where your son was born and ask to be sure.|`|Sd8Chp9Jaa	Definitely no...|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I wouldnt use it. Make sure you have special containers that are for storing breastmilk.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Thaw it out and do the sniff test.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://breastfeeding.hypermart.net/storagehandling.html" rel="nofollow">http://breastfeeding.hypermart.net/stora...</a><br>  Milk is not spoiled unless it has a sour odor or tastes bad. Some moms find that their milk seems to spoil rather quickly despite careful attention to proper storage and handling. This is thought to be a result of the milk having an excess of lipase, an enzyme which helps break down the fats in human milk. One way to keep milk from spoiling so quickly is to halt the breakdown of fats by scalding the milk just prior to storing it. This is done as soon after expression as possible and over a stove eye. Scalding the milk involves allowing small bubbles to appear on its surface but removing it from the heat before an actual boil occurs. The milk should then be stored immediately either in the refrigerator or freezer.
9ko5WUFkaa	Really, yes it's too early.  Your chances of getting a false result are high this early on.  Saying that, there are some brands of HPT that claim they can give you a result at about 2 weeks - it wouldn't hurt to try but I don't know how accurate they are.<br>  <br>  You really should wait until your period is late - that's when most HPT's work best, as your pregnancy hormone levels are high enough to give you an accurate result.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Yes way to early wait till u missed ur period|`|oHNrktxTaa	The longer you wait till your period is due, the higher your HCG levels will be. Which means your HPT will be more accurate. As difficult as this may be, I would try to wait until the day of your period or the day after to test first thing in the morning. Your urine has the most concentrate in it then. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you!|`|E0SJx3Csaa	you can, the early test say you can test up to 5 days before your period but as the box states, not all woman will have enough hormone yet to get a positive even if they are pregnant. each day you wait the stronger the hormone becomes if you are pregnant.|`|HU30GRn3aa	Too early. It's only been a week and a half. You should always wait until you've missed a period or at least a few weeks later not a week n a half :) <br>  But good luck with that later on.|`|RpwYzQvEaa	Yes, too early.  At least wait another week or until you miss your period.  I know it's not the answer you want, but you could get a false negative at this point.  Try to hang in there!
pzLDXL6gaa	I can't give you a probability, but it's definitely possible.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|PrZPZVvqaa	yup you may well be then, if your ovulating then thats the time of the month when you have your best chance to be pregnant!<br>  youl just have to wait and see!<br>  x
9X09kM4oaa	I have pcos and I was diagnosed at age 18-19... I had different boyfriends from then till about a year ago. I had sex without using protection because my doc said it would be a very small chance I could get pregnant so I believed it- and it seemed to be true but however I got pregnant at 22 and I was shocked and thrilled. Keep optimistic, it will happen when the time is right.|`|Wzws8v8daa	i have pcos.  i've been trying to get pregnant for 5 months with no luck so next month i'm starting the fertility medication.|`|3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	My wife was recently diagnosed with this...after many years of trying to decipher various medical issues that alone really didn't point to anything that really fit (yeah, kinda like being in a very long and drawn out episode of House).  We conceived naturally, and gave birth via cesarean.  we did however have 3 miscariages before successfully bringing the fetus to term.  Hope that helps...btw, she was 30 when she gave birth to our daughter who is now a very healthy and happy 4 year old|`|dDdMdUI0aa	i was recently diagnosed w/pcos i have 3 kids wich i conceived naturally my youngest 2 i didnt really have a period and am currently ttc#4 it took 2 years tc w/my 2nd and 1 yr to conceive w/my 3rd i hope his helps good luck!
stHol8ITaa	I can't read their mind, there's many possible reasons they'd act like this which I can think of:<br>  <br>  *Been not assertive enough to set stricter boundaries<br>  *Believing that stricter parenting just leads to rebellion (maybe thinking, "she's going to do what she wants to do anyway")<br>  *Indifference<br>  *Wanting you to experience life to the fullest<br>  *Maybe they had super-protective parents themselves and don't want to make you miserable by in turn setting strict boundaries on you<br>  *They could be simply the relaxed, laid-back type<br>  *Perhaps they feel the best way for you to learn is through experience<br>  <br>  And I could keep adding to that list all night but I think you get the idea. The only sure way of knowing is by asking them.|`|ITiuIb1Waa	enjoy it,cos you got about two years before they get onto you about getting a job|`|fcd41ae13b5b45292cfeda0b4cdff32baa	well great, probably means they were treated the same when they were younger.... or they just dont love you that much lol|`|AA12206581	lucky you.|`|RS4zYap0aa	maybe they're hippies, young and hip, or aliens :D orrrrrrr could have a deep dark secret that they dont want you to know bout so they let u stay out of the house...id start to investigate  lol but seriously if i was you **** id be having fun...but scared at the same time|`|IHDVQs3kaa	All parents are different.  Personally, I wouldn't be so liberal.  On the other hand, if they were strict, you would probably be complaining about that.  Take the middle road and for goodness sake, do not try the "drugs"|`|lxlFweA0aa	Some parents are like that, my mom was like that with my brother and kinda me. They must really trust you so i suggest don't do anything that will take there trust away.|`|lKpHd1yOaa	maybe they know that the best way for a child to learn is by experience.  besides the normal way our society brings up children (super protctive) is obviously not working out so well.|`|FRE2gov3aa	They are bad parents?|`|bFF02ezDaa	wow i wish i was u|`|ZKESDOrraa	do they not care?|`|jQvGLqgnaa	DAMN! you are LUCKY!!!...<br>  I ask my mum if i can go to the movies and I get third degree about it!<br>  ****!|`|f31e11a2391e029bbde885d1d31c8124aa	Maybe they want you to get it out of your system before college. Idk.|`|whw3DEjVaa	nah my parents r like that too.<br>  they just know that ull learn from ur own mistakes, and woteva makes u happy makes them happy.<br>  i just wish my friends parents werent so ruling. all my friend's parents live thru their kids. its really a shame coz i like goin out alot and they all cant. for example my friend's brother is 18 and he has a time limit to when he has to be indoors like hes 16.<br>  <br>  im 14 btw. it sucks. looking forward to turning 18. being a teenager is so boring.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Your parents did drugs with Janice Joplin...They just don't care.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Perhaps they were brought up like that themselves.  I was raised by parents who belonged to the 'let them do what they like' school of parenting, and they never tried to tell me what to do.  I do think they worried about me a bit though, they just didn't believe in intereference.<br>  <br>  However, i hope you are not going to be entirely irresponsible when you go to this festival.  If you are having sex, I hope you will be using a reliable method of contraception, and  I hope you won't be trying any drugs that might be dangerous.  However, laid-back your parents are, I am sure they want you to come home safe and undamaged.
Xu5BtID1aa	I think it's fine! If they don't like the name, then they don't need to use it! Thats kind of like me, I want to name our child Thailynn Rene'e Dye, Thai pronounced Ty but everyone is getting mad at me, telling me not to name the baby Thai Dye. All you can realld do is brush it off! If they keep going on about it, just tell them you like the name! Just like Ashley is a boy and a girls name, but more people are girls! or a Girl named Charlie! You would think it was a boy!!! I think you handled the situation good! Don't let it get to you!|`|AA10137828	Some people just like to hear themselves talk!<br>  <br>  Many put their mouth in gear before engaging the brain!<br>  <br>  If you like Dev Perry Packard as a name, who cares what some idiots might think!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't have named mine that, but it sounds cool to me!<br>  <br>  If Cruella DeVille asks why you named him that, tell them "your name was already taken!"<br>  <br>  Congratulations on the birth. Be proud of the little tax deduction, and his name!|`|ZTRakv6maa	if they have a problem with it, tell um to screw off! its not their kid...they dont have to worry about it.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Um I think they were the ones being offensive. If you dont like the name, just don't say anything or just lie. I know it sounds mean but there really is no harm in saying "oh thats nice" or "thats different at least there wont be three of those in his kindgarten class" People are so rude! Did they ask his name or did you ask their opinion? I think its a kinda cool name, maybe not something I would have thought of but I've known a boy named Trae, Romeo, Marquise and some other names that the kids really grow into and when they are older, you cant imagine having chosen anything else. Try and ignore rude comments. If you want to say something just say "When you have a child you can choose the name. He is my son and that is the name I chose and love" If they were your friends, they would be supportive and not mean spirited. Good luck!|`|3oSQQt6maa	Thats just the way people are always ready to judge, or maybe they were just joking to get a few laughs. I always get the same reaction from strangers even family when they met my son, i named him achilles, and all i hear is "poor baby" But it doesn't bother me cause its my son and my choice.|`|EZQIOIxxaa	Okay so my sons name is Rush and I always hear "huh huh like Rush Limbaugh", it makes me want to smack them!!!<br>  <br>  I, like you, usually just laugh it off but when they pick and pick at me about "why, why, why" I usually say (and this kinda goes with my garish personality) "you know what, you push a baby out of your vagina/penis and you can name it whatever you want!!" <br>  <br>  that may be a little much for some people but it seems to work for me!<br>  <br>  PS I love the name you picked, they can suck it!!!|`|siz5uRL3aa	Well first they should mind their own business but maybe they're concerned. I think that when parents name their child they don't understand they have to go to school. If they get ridiculed it could be your fault[or so the child may feel] well i guess, I don't know.|`|EUTRJqCsaa	I think it sounds like a boy's name. When my boyfriend has told people our son's name, they've assumed he's a girl. it's Jayden. personally, I think Jayden is for boys, Jade for girls.|`|oNpW9GEaaa	well i think tht it sounds lyke a good name who cares what other people say rite?|`|lZiwWAjkaa	I HEAR YOU!!!<br>  <br>  I get the same thing when I tell everyone my son's name is Donald.  I always get the same stupid Donald Duck joke and frankly it's getting old.  I named him not after the stupid duck, but after his father and his grandfather.  I'm also angry just because it's nobodys business what you name your kids.  <br>  <br>  You should have said for them to not make fun of your son's name because this offends you and if they continue, that's where you get ugly girl!!<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone demean your son or you for something you feel is right.  I know I don't.  When someone makes a joke about his name, I am very straight forward and I let them know it offends me and not to play like that.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Dev Perry Packard. <br>  Nope, sorry simply cannot manage the mental contortions needed to get 'girl' out of that name.<br>  The only way i could possibly think of (with a great deal of mental contorting here!) is they misheard the V as a B, but if so they need their hearing checked, I'm partially deaf and haven't done that yet.<br>  Dev, dimunitave form of Devon- boys name<br>  Perry- dimunitive for Perigrin- also boys name!<br>  <br>  If i hear a name that might possibly be unisex (Samoans are really good at unisex names with a lot of men having names that I previosly thought were soley girls names) I withold judgement until I see the kid.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Cause some people care far too much about sort of trivial thing. What you could do is tell them exactly why you DID decide on that particular name. It IS unusual, but I don't see anything wrong with it. Dev is a cool name for a boy! Maybe if they know why you chose it, they'll calm down. It'll especially irk em if it happens to be a relatives name. Or you could just do is frown at them, and say, "my wife and I think it's a great name." and simply walk away. <br>  <br>  Congrats, BTW. :)
BNCpLcLoaa	I think its VERY wrong that he is letting his son look at you in this way. You are meant to be a role model to him, you can't be that is he is looking at you in a sexual way. I think you need to have some Strong words with your boyfriend. He shouldn't be looking at ANY topless pics when his son is in the room, let alone ones of you. I have a 3 yr old and when she hits the age I am not going to let her perve on her dad...its not right.|`|7AUqSr4uaa	I think its normal for a boy to be curious, but not normal at all for his dad to let him look at you in that way!<br>  <br>  Totally unacceptable, you are not there for his son to 'learn' about.<br>  <br>  We all look at our parents bodies when we are little, but this is different.<br>  <br>  I would feel very uncomfortable as well, your BF is well out of order and it seems like he doesnt respect your feelings, your privacy, or even understand why its wrong!!|`|qaOU5mLoaa	Its up to you to set the boundaries which are completely determined by the way you feel. If you are uncomfortable with it you need to set thatboundaryy and not feel violated.<br>  <br>  Soon your SS will learn what's right and wrong, in the mean time its up to you to decide.|`|AA12265821	Overstepping eh that is really creepy <br>  uh em be afraid that is not normal for a <br>  dad/step dad/bf to say at all and youSS<br>  wont do any of that ...<br>  =ox|`|NXeLcbO0aa	your step son is 9 and courious about these things, he knows alot more than your man thinks. yes it is creepy and your bf should not let this behavour go on.|`|YXeX2LtNaa	i'd say its kind of creepy, you should talk to your boyfriend.|`|S3ZpMLxgaa	1st of all, it ain't right!  and tell them this behavior is not acceptable|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Odd.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	I'd say that's beyond the 'father/son behavior'. You really need to talk to him about that, I'd feel uncomfortable to all hell.|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	Creepy. Thats disgusting. If his son was 14, fine, you could understand, he would be curious and you may expect ( not saying its right! ) this from a young boy, but for his dad to be saying this as well?! Has he got a screw loose? I would have said to him straight away that hes the perv for even thinking that.|`|TEqxfG3Maa	creepy|`|fcd41ae13b5b45292cfeda0b4cdff32baa	partly both|`|3B6p9zEiaa	Coming from a similar perspective ( My fiance's son was 11 when we got together) I don't think it is normal at all.. and definitely a no go if it makes you uncomfortable. You need to lay down the law to ur bf that what he did was not on, and boundaries need to be explained to both him and SS.. I agree that its natural that boys his age are interested in what girls have that they don't have, buty its wrong for him to be looking at you.. Especially if you are going to be any form of parent figure to the child then he needs to respect you, and you are not being respected by being perved on..|`|YqHL52H5aa	Definitely creepy.  While no doubt the step son is developing into puberty and has some new hormones to deal with, it doesn't give him the right to invade other people's privacy.  This is not the lesson you want to teach your son.  <br>  <br>  Now, have you seen any of this behavior in your step son yet?  If not, I would take a cautious approach until he is clearly crossing a boundary.  Have the father sit down with him and explain what is proper and what is improper.  This will only help him in future relationships down the road.|`|GUFb4TZVaa	This is not normal behaviour for father or son. it is totally invading your privacy! ur bf sounds like hes encouraging SS to be acting like this, he should be protecting him from things like this... rather than making him view pictures of u topless, this is just weird! A 9 year old kid has no need to even know what sex is at that age... he is stil a child, maybe aged 10 / 11 would be appropriate|`|sLkruqYVaa	Definitely overstepping boundaries .The way he chooses to educate his son and the birds and the bees is up to him but he can't go around expecting you to be the dummy for show and tell.Come on put your foot down it's a question of respect|`|chfA4aK1aa	Creepy... definitely overstepping boundaries. Looking at topless photos of you with the boy in the room? And he's only 9 years old? Yeah, awful. Not cool. I'm creeped out.|`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	That is completely wrong.<br>  No normal father would find that normal at all.<br>  <br>  Talk to your boyfriend and tell him how uncomfortable what he said has made you feel|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Creepy, father sounds very immature if not a perv. I think you better consider counseling for all of you. Good luck|`|ziz0xURoaa	That's some creepy fetish for your bf it sounds like...|`|RW3SzwINaa	waaay to much, you need to talk to him!
AA11182621	I agree with everyone else that you should go to the Doctor asa a precautionary measure. If in Doubts go and see the Doc, that is what they are there for.<br>  <br>  Yahoo Answers is a great place, but when it come to something like this, do not hesitate but go and see your GP NOW.<br>  It is probably nothing, but jsut to be to sure, to be sure.<br>  <br>  Wishing you all the very best for you and your baby|`|AGcwdZGmaa	you need to have it checked asap i had it happen and it was a miscarriage im not saying yours is but better safe then sorry even if its just spots or smears it still needs checking <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  and zanneh if you dont want to read it dont it is the pregnancy Q these "gross" things happen there is worse things then his|`|jCPM5GJiaa	you don't need to wait until your next appointment, if there is anything worrying you then you should make another appointment with your GP or your nurse.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	Nobody on here can really give you the answer you want/need.  Both of those things can be normal, but both can be bad signs as well.<br>  <br>  Cramps that you get in early pregnancy are usually very mild, rather than being at all comparable to "normal cramps" - but then again, if your normal cramps are very mild, then maybe the cramps would be similar.<br>  <br>  I think all you can do is keep in mind that many early pregnancies end, and that you can't really feel "out of the woods" until the second trimester.  Even then, things happen.  So, just kind of be prepared that something could happen, wait to see,  but realize, too, that a lot of "funny" stuff happens in normal, early, pregnancies.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Brown discharge is usually old blood don't worry its nothing and normal first months of pregnancy. Just take care and be positive. Good Luck|`|rSfoEyE3aa	Your best bet is to ring the doctors ASAP
GEfpzUNvaa	take a hpt and good luck... symptoms.. nausea, being tired... just simply not feeling normal... a "glow" about you from what others have told me.. haha i don't believe that though.. good luck|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I had extremely sore boobs and my nipples got dark brown.<br>  <br>  I didn't get morning sickness, those were my only symptoms.  sorry if I couldn't help.
2ihxD6Z0aa	you may be pregnant. did you use opk's to see when you ovulated? if  you are 10-12days past ovulation the symptoms seem relevant to pregnancy. your cm could be another pregnancy sign as well. clomid can cause your cervical mucus to be hostile, but not in all cases. my advice is wait 2 days and test. try not to stress or you could delay your next cycle. i'd say you sound like you very well could be pregnant, wait and test.<br>  <br>  ****lots of sticky baby dust****<br>  <br>  i was on 50mg last month, had mood swings, cramps, sore boobs, lightheartedness, and broke out. the symptoms started after i took me last pill and lasted until af. turns out the 50mg didn't even make me ovulate. this month i'm on 100mg, from the first day of pills, i have had severe mood swings, depression, lightheadedness, and sore boobs. i got a + opk on the 19th[cd18], and have experienced pain in my left ovary, and cramps. most other symptoms have gone away. now i'm in the dreaded 2ww. i know none of that probably helps you, but maybe you could compare and what not.
Fy9S6hjIaa	Oh yeah.  This actaully happened quite a bit when our boy was an infant.  As to weather I corrected them or not, it depended.  I noticed that usually the people who confused the gender were elderly people at the grocery store or resturant, or park, or where ever.  If it was just a quick stop and say "oh she's so beautiful" I just let it go but if they lingered to ask how old "she" was and what "her" name was etc... then I would usually correct them politly.  I can understand people mistaking boys for girls much more than girls for boys because baby girls usually have some pink.  I mean sure, a girl might have a blue stroller, but I've never seen a baby boy being toted around in a pink car seat!<br>  <br>  My sister in law's little girl is very close to the same age as my little boy.  When they're together they are very commonly mistaken for twins.  Last summer, we were at a 4th of July festival, they were almost 1 and both of them were dressed in red shirts and blue shorts and baseball caps (we didn't even plan it, it just happened that they were almost matching).  Well, they were sitting in their strollers next to each other (his blue, hers pink) and an elderly couple walked up and said "oh what adorable twins!"  Well, we'd gotten so many "twins" comments that day that we just said thank you.  Well the woman asked what their names were and I relplied Abbie and Mason.  So she reaches down into the PINK stroller and shakes the baby's hand and says "well hello there Mason.  What a big boy you are"  then moves over to the BLUE stroller and says "and oh what petty hair you have Miss Abbie".  Then she waved bye to them and went on her way.  It was actually pretty funny.  But what was more funny was that my husband took our son to get his first hair cut the very next day!|`|B1JFBV3jaa	Yeah, it drives me crazy.  My daughter ALWAYS wears a bunch of pink and even has her ears pierced and I have been asked a couple of times if she was a boy or a girl....some people are ridiculous.  If I had a boy, I doubt I would have him decked out in pink!!  (I think it's because she is bald.  But even her face is really femme and petite.  Who knows...)|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	Oh yes my baby girls get confused for a boy often enough, it's my fault though cause most babies look alike and don't have distinctive features to say girl or boy and i didn't dress her up in pink for a few months ( i got so tired of everything pink) but then i decided i would buy her clothes that are have a hint of pink somewhere and sometimes that doesn't even work, but it's ok. Sometimes i correct them if we talk for a little bit if they are just passing by and mention her i just smile and say thank you.|`|jYPeis3Saa	no. my son is all boy. he cant be mistaken for a girl. i think even if we decided to dress him in girls clothing hed still really look like a boy! <br>  <br>  what annoys me is that my mother in law tells my son "oh, you're so pretty" i always correct her and say "no, he's handsome" i cannot stand that she says hes pretty. girls are pretty and boys are handsome! he doesn't even remotely look like a girl! <br>  <br>  <br>  i did think this woman in the play group that we belong to had 2 girls, until i found out she has 2 boys. they have long hair and really do look like little girls. i never said anything though, because i think its rude too.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i cant tell you how many times i had my daughter dressed in pink from head to toe and someone would say "what a cute little guy" or "isnt he sweet" it was usually older people for some reason, maybe you go color blind with age.  i just smiled and said thank you , no reason to embarras them when they were trying to be nice, and in most cases i was never going to see them again anyway.|`|eTJB3qZLaa	I have done it... When I'm not sure of the gender I try to not say him or her...   Now that I'm a first time mom to be I know that I will make sure that you can tell... But I would correct some one who gets it wrong... nicely... I always feel bad when I get it worng but it makes me ry even harder to not say him or her unless I'm 100% sure.|`|nyuB4POqaa	Yes people mistake my daugther as a boy quite often. I just smile, because I personaly don't think it's offensive what so ever. It's easy to do at such a young age, unless they're obviously wearing pink or blue, then that just makes me mad lol.|`|4YDpeKbOaa	My daughter is nearly 2 now so it doesn't happen anymore, but when she was very little she would be mistaken for a boy lots, even though she would always be in pink or purple and had bows in her hair and things. lol i just let it go.|`|V7sfV5odaa	Babies are a blessing, be glad the baby is beautiful!  Thank God he blessed you with a child. <br>  <br>  Don't be so sensitive, as he grows You will have A lot of challenges.|`|p61Msx1zaa	yes all the time I don't have a child but my sister has no hair and people always call her a little boy or they say hey little guy then sometimes my mom gets angry and throws a pink blanket over her lol|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	Thats because your son is beautiful! lol it happens to me all the time i correct them and laugh and say i know its the eye lashes.|`|7p9qgkSFaa	Well, I don't have have any kids but I am 14 and my sister is pregnant so I guess I feel I should get used to the pregnancy and small child section. But, anyway, as I was saying, back when I was a baby, my parents have told me people used to think I was a boy all the time. My parents tried to dress me in gender neutral clothes so that could have been why but also sometimes when I was dressed even a lot like a girl as you described I was called a boy. I think it happens to all parents a few times, some more than others. I think you should say thank you because wrong gender or not saying you have a beautiful child is a compliment. I would still say after thank you my baby is boy, but that's okay.|`|oQzjoPlGaa	People should stop being so ridiculously stereotypical! So what if someone thinks your baby is the wrong gender? I was always dressed in brown and grey as a kid and got called a boy a million times, I'm perfectly happy with my gender now.... It has been shown that if you gender stereotype children too much when they are young, they show more stereotypical characteristics when older. Eg boys will be violent and selfish, girls will be weak and unsure of themselves.|`|kA4umuYfaa	In a baby's early days, it kind of hard to tell whether if its a boy or a girl. Theres hardly anything to tell it apart from boy or girl. In time, when the baby gets older, it will resemble something to their gender and not the gender people say it is. Just give your baby some time to mature a little.|`|li6TWpzZaa	its okay...that had happened to my cousin already. Her baby is a girl, and really looks like a boy. she even dress her baby girl to look like a boy, hehe. its really fun..<br>  <br>  dont worry bout that, dont take it seriously...|`|AA11979442	So many people think that my son is a girl. It is probably because he looks just like I did when I was a baby. A few people have told me and my husband the only reason they knew he was a boy was because of the colors he was dressed in. At Christmas, my cousin's grandmother was convinced my son was a girl...even though he was dressed in a blue outfit...and even though I kept saying "he does this" and "he does that". After 10 min or so the only reason she realized that he was a boy was because I told her his name and she inquired why we would give a girl a boy's name. :)<br>  <br>  I usually correct people. Often in a pleasant way. Something like "Oh, we get that all the time he is so pretty everyone think he is a girl."|`|IGcS9K62aa	You can't get offended. People are not too smart! <br>  <br>  One day my daughter waswearing a pink out fit with hearts on it and was I was told, "What an adorable little boy." Not only does she look super girly--but hello??? Pink with hearts? Even if you're color blind people you at least know shapes!! I just smiled and said, "Yes, he is quite cute!!!"|`|FHT6wsUpaa	ALL the time.<br>  <br>  I guess because she doesn't (yet) have a head full of bouncing curls down to her shoulders? Her hair is really still quite sparse.<br>  <br>  I do correct people, except when it is BLATANTLY obvious that she's a girl...i.e. when I have her dressed head to toe in pink. And yes, people have mistaken her gender even then. Moments like that I just nod and smile...and wonder how someone could miss something so simple.

jYPeis3Saa	wether you have a big baby or a teeny tiny baby depends on genetics and how well you take care of yourself during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  mothers who have gestational diabetes tend to have bigger babies. and it doesnt matter if they were in shape or overweight pre baby.<br>  <br>  i weighed 8lbs 4oz. at birth my husband weighed 9lbs. 15oz. <br>  i was convinced i wouldh ave this gigantic baby but he only weighted 7lbs. and im overweight.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	you go ahead and do that ironman|`|cjqKMjWnaa	i know plenty of overweight moms who had average, or smaller-than-average sized babies.  on the other side of the spectrum, i'm 5'3" and weigh 110-115, depending on the week ;) ... my first was 7 lbs 5 oz and my 2nd was 8 lbs 2 oz!  i also have a friend who is smaller than me and she had only 1 baby who was 6 lbs, the other 3 weighed 7, 8 and 9 lbs.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	The average weight for a newborn is 7 pounds so both of the babies that you mentioned were below normal birth weight. The size of the mother doesn't really play a large factor in the weight of the infant unless the mother has diabetes. Diabetic mothers usually have babies that are bigger then 7 pounds.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	i dont think the weight of the mother effects the weight of the baby and 5 and 6 pound babies are not over weight.  that might actually be considered a little under weight.|`|CiFR2xuBaa	I'm overweight and my 1st child was 5 lbs 8 oz. and the 2nd child was 6 lbs. 12 oz.

PFO1jxZGaa	I would give him mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, pureed peas etc. he is also old enough to have some meat ( minced really fine or just one in gerber foods etc. <br>  At eight mos my kids had about 28 oz of milk, 4 oz of juice, brunch, ( riceceral and half a jar of stage 2 foods around 11 am) and dinner ( pretty much the same) around 6 pm. They also had some crackers or cheerios, or diced fruit for a snack. <br>  If your kid is growing fine and doesnt seem to be hungry, I'm sure his fine, but you candefinately start giving him other foods than bananas just to get some variety|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Do you mean 22 ounces of mixed formula or 22 ounces of dry formula mixed with water (which would usually be 44 ounces.)?<br>  <br>  If it's 22 ounces of formula mixed total, that is not enough for an 8 month old.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	At 8 months, your baby should have unlimited access for formula. As much, as he wants as frequently as he wants(He will stop sucking and push away the bottle when he is done). This is usually between 24-36 ounces for most babies. solids should be given after a formula feed, (again as much as he wants as long as he has already had formula) 2-3 times a day at this age. Formula is the main source of nutrition.<br>  <br>  Also, you should vary the food you are giving. Add different fruits and vegetables(one new one at a time, 4 days apart so you can look for reactions). Most babies can handle small amounts of meats, yogurt, cheese and boiled egg yold at this age too. My 9 month old son's meal plan today was:<br>  5AM Nurse<br>  7AM 7 ounce bottle of breastmilk followed by breakfast of 2 tablespoons cereal and 1 tbs peaches mixed, half a piece of bread torn into small pieces for him to eat<br>  11AM 7 ounce bottle followed by lunch of 1 tbs sweet potato, one tbs meat, and steamed potato cut into small chunks for him to eat<br>  3 PM 6 ounce bottle<br>  5PM Dinner (I limit this so he will eat his next bottle) 1 tbs avacado, 1 tbs yogurt, some well cooked green beans in small chunks<br>  7PM 7 ounce bottle<br>  <br>  Oh i offer very diluted juice or water in cups during his meals as well.

E0SJx3Csaa	i would go to a fertility specialist, ask for clomid and IUI, clomid is like less than a hundred bucks and IUI is around $300. Pay yourself and leave the medicare out of it, medicare wont pay for that ! <br>  you will end up spending like a thousand , but its worth it, and as far as the doctors cost, you can make payments.and you mat get a discount for being self pay.<br>  <br>  IUI = inter uterine injection. they will make you ovulate with clomid, then they will inject the sperm right into the uterus !! works wonders for PCOS|`|5SmX1oLlaa	sorry but don't know the answer to this . i hope you find the answer from someone. good luck.|`|afDDiHbXaa	go see another doc and get a second opinion.I have pcos an have just been put on metformin i feel so ill on it. i haven't had a perio in months and doc hoping this will start my cycle off.i don't have another appointment till june then if this doesn't work i will be prescribed something else but i hate the waiting game i want something now to get me pregnant now.its really hard isn't it.|`|Wzws8v8daa	i also have pcos and have to take progesterone to get a period.  i'm starting clomid next month.  you should give that a try, i have heard lots of success stories with clomid.<br>  why did you say you are tempted to buy it online?  just go to your doctor and talk to him about it so he can give you a prescription for it.
1B91qtNQaa	Don't let her dress like that. I would never let my daughter dress like that at 14. Heck I don't even dress like that myself and I am 30. <br>  <br>  She is a beautiful girl but doesn't need to be dressing in low cut tops.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	No matter what you do in life someone is always going to have something to say. Its just jealousy and she shouldnt let it get to her. Teach her to be confident with herself and when they say mean things to her...let it go in one ear and out the other.|`|AA10943329	are you just after people to tell you how beautiful your daughter is?

I am 13 and say she is very beutiful.<br>  <br>  I would take her o na shopping spree maybe and make her feel good about herself..do everything you can to make her feel better.I get made fun of all the time because im skinny and short for an 8th grader but you know what<br>  We speak diffrent languages<br>  We come from diffrent cultures<br>  But no matter where you are or who you are<br>  You are not responsible for your past<br>  But you are respnsible for your future<br>  <br>  you need to remind her that she is beutiful no matter what anyone says...she is who she is and  nobody can change that.she has to learn to become stronger than she was before and to just not care what people think of her because you know what?They are just making fun of her because they know it gets to her so she must stick up for herself because no one in school can tell her what to do or who she is|`|O1m2PaMjaa	Chances are there is more to the story than she might be telling you. If you are a parent, there are certain things that naturally a child wouldn't want their parents to know. My sympathies to your daughter; crying everyday because of someone else is terrible, but maybe there is a factor you are missing.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Maybe she gets made fun for for having a mother her lets her go to school looking like a college student, not a young girl. <br>  Maybe you could buy her some decent clothes, and make her wash all that makeup off her face. <br>  That would help alot.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	you are the daughter fishing for compliments, ive seen your other questions<br>  why do you look like  a hooker with all that make up on ?|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	I answered your other one, but there seem to be people on this one who think you really are the mother.<br>  <br>  People, read the Q&A's.... this is the daughter.<br>  <br>  Lame.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Tell her they're jealous and to ignore it. Tell her to focus on herself, and tell them that those jealous kid's opinions don't matter.|`|OYIJyQDjaa	POSER!<br>  you can find this pic if u google gorgeous girl or model, one of the two.<br>  and that girl is fat.|`|OWWsnStWaa	i think that you should sit and talk to herr and let her know how speical she is|`|6ddNezzSaa	im 14. why would she be made fun of? i wouldnt tease her. she reminds me of my friend. who makes fun of her? if its guys, well there may be more than just teasing...maybe sexual harassment? if she wants to she can report it as that she can. if girls make fun of her, they are just jealous. just hug her and tell her to ignore what people say. thats what i would do. tell her that she should knows that shes beautiful and it doesnt matter what anyone thinks in the long run (although it seems it now) then just totally ignore everyone. shes a good person and she should like herself. also tell her that shell get through it. and even though people say it doesnt work, if you play along or don't give a reaction, people will get tired of teasing you. people used to make fun of me about other stuff : ) and i got through it. tell her to be strong and have cookies ready when she gets home tomorrow. good luck!|`|HKKg2Vhxaa	you are the daughter. any mother in their right mind wouldnt put a picture of their daughter on the internet so freely like that. especially revealing that much skin.
AGcwdZGmaa	lucky i didn't show for a long time with my 1st and she was very healthy good luck and congrats|`|1jwbQaZTaa	it all depends on your body.. the way your built, the way your carrying. <br>  my SIL looked MAYBE 5 months pregnant when she delivered because she carried more in her back instead of up front.<br>  <br>  as long as your doc isnt alarmed by the size at all, im sure all is well. trust me once you get to where you cant see your toes, this will just seem silly.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|7OZQ7PqTaa	Your doctor will tell you at your regular checkups if the baby isn't growing at the appropriate rate...I wouldn't worry about it-most women, especially for a first pregnancy, don't start showing until 5 or 6 months.|`|5TQZprTSaa	your baby is fine.. i didn't show intill 25 weeks.
I2lEkHJ9aa	this will not last forever. probably just a couple of weeks. just try to be there for your son. he is experiencing a loss of something that was very important to him. as long as your there to love him (i know its hard to wake up that many times at night) you will show him that you are there to meet his emotional needs with out giving in to a bad habit. it is really important to get rid of the bottle for his teeth's sake. sounds like your doing a good job. you can't take away his pain or anger for his loss but you can be there with him though his hard time. you can offer something else at night like a ice cube or a blanket. chances are nothing is going to do it. so just be there to hold him. i like the book idea. or just make up a story. destraction is always good if possable.|`|2N4j1ficaa	aww poor chap  my son did this and they get a lot of pain  if he is still crying i would take back to the dentist  im shore it wont be his bottle or breast his after ....|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	extra cuddles are all I got from looking it up, which is not much help at all.  You could say 'you are drinking from a cup like Mommy.  That's good!'. <br>  Blankie?  Teddy bear?  Have you tried a straw? My babies used them early.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	we weaned my daugther from her bottle just recently and when she really needs   a drink at night we give her  a sippy cup, but since your boy cant suck anything, it seems like you dont have a lot of options for soothing, except letting him learn to self-soothe. this is a good age to break him of the bottle anyway, so maybe its a blessing in disguise. let him cry it out, he will adjust.<br>  <br>  <br>  thumbs down huh?|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Just let him cry, eventually he'll adjust to the new schedule. It's hard to ignore them when they are emotional but you must stay firm and ignore the night time fits. He'll tire out and fall back asleep.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Aww, poor little guy, just hold him and comfort him.. this will only last a few nights.. a week tops.|`|JWYs2pBgaa	if he's old enough to have a favourite tv character, why not take him shopping and let HIM choose a new big boy cup (with a lid) possibly in his fav character pattern, perhaps a full childs dining set that he's chosen and the fact that he's chosen might make it more appealing for him to use, lots of big boy praise for using the cup, and someone suggested a straw, that might help too, i used the straw method to help my son stop drooling believe it or not.  the think with kids (like men) is if they think an idea is all theirs they're more likely to employ it and us women... we just have to engineer their way of thinking round to it being their idea in the first place lol hope his tooth heals quickly and don't be tempted to go back to the bottle once it's fixed because you'll have this battle all over again..<br>  <br>  oh just had another thought, what about if he makes some gesture at giving his bottles up to a new baby who needs them now he's a big boy and him getting a reward? yep, good old fashioned bribary!|`|OUbgs89taa	All you can really do is sooth him. <br>  you say he wakes up for his bottle at night? Did you still give him night feeds? If so, try giving him a drink from a cup like you do in the day. Also, if its just that the bottle is a comfort thing. Just give him a bottle... he wont suck it because it hurts but maybe just having it close by will help?|`|aa04f7927ab71de6337c1691db125f73aa	When weaning/bottle it's the best not to be with him in the night time. Let baby fall asleep with husband, mother..etc but not you. This is the faster way to help baby and yourself get over it. Don't go to him during the night, let your partner deal with it for 3 nights - if possible.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Just cuddle him.  I know you are probably losing sleep, but it won't last long.|`|Dx2ayijwaa	There is really few things you could do. My son has gone through this, but not from fractured tooth. He would drink in his sleep through one or two 8oz bottles at night. When my doctor told me this can cause his baby teeth to rot, I weened him off of it. The First thing I tried was rocking him to sleep when he woke up, but he was still continuously hungry, so before he went to bed. I would feed him more food and drink. Milk works best.  This worked for about half of the night. Then I just tried to do things that made it easier for me to sleep. I turned the thermostat up a little in his room and he only woke up about once a night. I hope this helps|`|Poht8MR9aa	Its a shame to have to introduce a pacifier, but maybe as a last resort.<br>  since this is a big change for him you will have to change the usual time for night night routine. Try getting him ready for bed and pour you and he a glass of milk that you take to an area to get him into bed, we had a big chair we would sit in, dim the lights and read him a calming book and when you first sit down both of you drink your milk have a good yawn and say how your sleepy and then read him his story and take him to bed, as with anything else new routines take time, but sooner or later you would be at this cross roads anyways.
CJkrXeDgaa	the different languages spoken is kind of the point of the video.  Mine has an explanation in the introduction about why the baby needs to hear the different languages, yada, yada.<br>  I think no matter what language it's in, the baby just likes hearing a soothing voice and watching the pretty colors.<br>  PS. after watching it about a million times, I would have those nursery rhymes stuck in my head...not knowing what in the world I was saying! Sounded like Liza, bit the la liza. It would crack me up.|`|I2lEkHJ9aa	funny. chances are you just bought one with different lang. some of the DV D's are suppose to be like that. most only have classical music and no words in them at all. others have English. if your child likes it then no worries, just let it be. hearing different lang. will connect neurons in the brain whether or not your baby understands it or not. my son really like the xmas one with no words at all.|`|5YPSyP91aa	there are a million baby enstein disks, all of which speak in eng except for one called "language nursery", which is for teaching the concept of languages. that must be the one you got. if you wish to have 100% eng, buy another. <br>  <br>  i recommend baby beethoven and baby mozart, no language though, just music and visual things.
0M5XYROfaa	Hey sweetie.<br>  You doctor shouldove explained this to you.<br>  On the pill you usually do not ovulate, the point of the pill is to trick your body into thinking you are pregnant. The bleed you get is called withdrawl bleeding also known as a fake period. Although i have heard that very rarely girls have ovualted and become pregnant, you usually do not ovualte while on the pill. The sugar pills are to keep you body in a cycle. But really they have nothing in them which is why you bleed. look your pill up on the internet for more info<br>  Good luck=]|`|ZK7JztHyaa	if you are taking birth control you will NOT ovulate|`|AA10063059	you dont ovulate on the pill
jw1bNJMCaa	im not gonna lie baised on a guys point of view she is blessed. all joking aside sum girls mature faster than others. Actually, the most common selling bra size is 34C, but most women do not wear the right bra size and have not measured recently - so 34C is also the most common INCORRECT size.<br>  <br>  There is no average size based on age, because everyone's body is different. It depends on your height, weight, genes and fat content in your body, exercise habits, etc.  so for all that you know she is perfectly fine.literaly. Some girls notice breast growth as early as age 7 or 8, while others don’t start until age 13 or so. The timing is determined by your own biologic “clock” that tells your body to start producing high levels of female hormones. Breasts go through five “stages” of growth over the next five to six years, until their full maturity is reached by age 17 or 18. The final size of a girl’s breasts is determined by heredity and can range from very small (like bra size AA) to very full (such as size EE). Breast size varies greatly among women, and all sizes and shapes are normal and healthy.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	34b is normal. I was around a 32b at that age and fortunately I never had any problem with guys making comments.<br>  <br>  If she is with you when they say these things (like you said in the question) then I think you need to tell them to knock it off. What age are these guys? If I were you I would have a word with them. Throw a couple of jokes at them and they'll get the message.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	yh thts fine i wish i had bigger boobs i am only 32 a|`|JVPt99Hxaa	i would love to give you a good answer but i just cant understand what you have put sorry|`|A3zAXntxaa	Wait, what's the question again? I can't read your.. stuff, hehe.
kc2Sa7ibaa	There is a minor chance. Everytime you have sex there is a risk. The morning after pill is only around 85% effective. People have been concieved using birth controls and condoms but you *should* be okay. Good Luck <3|`|TtMKPBR3aa	NO! boy are you lucky! a girl can only get pregnant if the man says "i love you" while he is doing it to her so unless you said that exactly you have nothing to worry about|`|lb8FBhWnaa	tell her to go to the doctor and find out.|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	Yes there is definitely a chance that she could be pregnant. She most likely isn't, but she might be.<br>  <br>  I hope everything turns out fine for you and your girlfriend.
ectaeydbaa	Hmm... Esmeer McCoy & Weszlyn Iris.<br>  And Islah Audrey & Zemyrah Korei.|`|VTkRjExmaa	i like Khelson Leilund and Weszlyn Iris <br>  <br>  but Weszlyn Iris is kinda feminine name...try Weszton..<br>  <br>  <br>  IsLah Audrey and Zemyrah Korei ,, two names are unique and cute..|`|yH39NEXSaa	Well... They definitely are unique! I admire uniqueness and some of those names are really nice BUT those spellings personally turn me off. Please don't butcher those name with those spellings. It looks really tacky and the child will CONSTANTLY have to correct people on how to spell it.<br>  <br>  I don't like any of the boy's names to be perfectly honest with you. But I do like Nnenna, Isla, Audrey, and Joleigh for girls.|`|2NGmNlBVaa	yes very unqiue and thas good<br>  my fav in girls is<br>  Zemyrah Korei<br>  and in boys is Esmeer mcCoy|`|5OH4XPaIaa	2 Fave Girl names: Haedyn and Zemyrah are actually really pretty!

The spelling is awful. Sorry, I just can't say that I like them.|`|B7nqTcttaa	I like Jabeau Linkin put together.<br>  Lundin IsLah put together is pretty too.<br>  The only thing is, with such different spelling the child will be constantly having a mispronounced name.|`|kmY4uD2Oaa	There really nice. Very unique!!|`|AA12254690	That is ridiculous all those names are very selfish to pick being  that no normal person will know how to pronounce them right away except for you! Your poor boy or girl will have to constantly be pronouncing it to everyone he or she meets!!!! I understand being original but thats pretty well you get my point. Sorry if you feel I'm being rude. <br>  HOWEVER Audrey is beautiful|`|mgLNIfiIaa	Weszlyn? Nnenna? Sorry but they sound like the names of pain killers or words in a foreign language. <br>  <br>  You spelled Audrey as Audrey as not OrDree, why ruin Hayden, Isla and Jolie with weird spellings? <br>  <br>  Isla Audrey and Hayden Jolie would be gorgeous names. : )|`|X1cVlshoaa	Being truly honest I don't really like any of them. <br>  I don't really like uncommon names as the children may get teased.<br>  The decision of course is yours and I don't mean to have insulted you, everyone is different.|`|D0y3MwDcaa	just a hint for the boys.. if you have to tell someone how to pronounce it then dont use it... they are all a little too "out there" for me! sorry..<br>  <br>  <br>  I like Haedyn Londin.. the u is just a failed attempt at being unique. sorry!|`|TrBoPj92aa	Awwh really sweet for the girls : <br>  Islaan Joleigh and Islah Audrey, you could spell islah like isla <br>  and island for islaan. <br>  <br>  Isla Aubrey<br>  Isla Alice<br>  Isla Arabella<br>  <br>  Boys : <br>  <br>  Weszlyn McCoy is soo adorable<br>  Jabeau Dien i prefer Jacob Beau but its cute|`|BtxQogSzaa	All sound very nice<br>  <br>  Khelson Leilund  for the boy<br>  <br>  Nnenna LiiVaeh  for the girl#<br>  <br>  They are the ones i like|`|Wl8tRVWBaa	I only like Khelson Leilund for a boy, and Islah Audrey for a girl.|`|0c30f5fdc0cc17a33e0ba8fe4201b997aa	It mostly just looks like you don't know how to spell.
mgLNIfiIaa	I like swimming and the ocean, but I've had no urges to name a boy Swimmer.<br>  <br>  Don't do it! <br>  <br>  If you want a musical name, maybe Melody for a girl?|`|x3g9IlhVaa	Bet he gets poet for a nickname and all the other kids will ask him if he is a rhymer for limericks and stuff.  Think how he will feel when he is old and his name gets shortened to Ry.  If you are going to give him this as a first name then give him a middle name that he can use instead when he is sick of being picked on.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	In my opinion, it's an odd first name, but here are some name suggestions: :) <br>  <br>  I would use it for a middle name:<br>  Paul Rhymer <br>  Matthew Rhymer<br>  Bryce Rhymer<br>  Michael Rhymer<br>  Chase Rhymer<br>  Trevor Rhymer<br>  Thomas Rhymer <br>  Joseph Rhymer <br>  Damien Rhymer <br>  Dylan Rhymer|`|lQNGse10aa	oh i love that name..<br>  Rhymer it's really cute<br>  <br>  Rhymer Asher<br>  Rhymer Tristan<br>  Rhymer James<br>  Rhymer Andrew<br>  Rhymer Benjamin<br>  Rhymer Noah|`|VTkRjExmaa	Rhymer would be a nice name,,,..<br>  <br>  Rhymer Jazz..<br>  <br>  John Rhymer..|`|32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	I dont really like it,sorry..|`|ky3B42f6aa	He will no doubt have to learn to defend himself at an early age with a monicker like that.  Why not be certain, and name him "Sue"?
145RUNQHaa	Children sometimes behave differently in school than they do at home often it's the opposite they misbehave at home and are good at school because school can be quite restricting and their energys and frustrations come out at home.but with you it sounds like all the perfect behaviour at home is driving him mad and he's letting his energys out at school.most four year olds have a little mischief in them that has to come out somewhere!it's only natural.you're doing well with the rewarding if he's been good that day but i would also give him a lot of activites to do after school and weekends like swimming ,football a trip to the park to work off his energy.he's old enough to talk to and ask what's up in school you never know what's bothering him.hope this helps.x|`|IGcS9K62aa	I would talk to HIM about it. He's at the helpful age when he's innocent enough to be honest. Ask him why he doesn't like the other kids at school? What does he do that makes him mad? Explore the topic with him and go from there. Don't confront or discipline but ask for his opinion. He should be more than compliant to share his feelings with you.

5i8rtlmXaa	Your dad knows what 12 year old boys think and do, he was a 12 year old boy at one time.I understand I only had guy friends growing up, the girls never liked me because I was 2 years older than every one in my class and had a very popular brother so the girls were not my friends, anyways sit down and talk to them like an adult with no arguing and no smart mouthing and maybe you can change their minds.brainstorm what you want to say and have a good but nice comeback to what you already know they are going to say.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I was a tom boy, most of my friends were boys. So it was not a problem. Best thing to do is sit down and have a rational conversation with your parents. Explain that these boys are friends, etc. If they say no. Be polite and except the decision. We might not always get what we want, but that doesn't mean what we get isn't that great. Show them how mature you are becoming. If not at 12, perhaps 13.|`|io0QtYYtaa	you dont. sorry, parents worry and are nosy and need to be involved in your life. look at all the kids in your school having sex and doing drugs, their parents arent involved. ask your parents to have boys there grin and bear it and just be thankful that you have parents that love you and care about you. trust when your older you'll figure it out, right now its annoying but its worth it.|`|g8WQKTNTaa	They don't want you to grow up so fast.

E5CnUdhsaa	has there been one sippy at all thats shes taken ok to a little bit? out of all the sippys which was she most interested in? that one will be her sippy and throw the rest out;) so she has only one big girls cup.  pour lil amounts into it a number of times a day and let her play with it, encourage her to drink sometimes. if she pushes it  away thats fine just leave it there, you can have some too(pretend make a big deal out of it) and get her excited about her new cup. lots and lots of praise when she takes a sip! she will eventually take to it (took my daughter about 2 weeks to be drinking fully from one) but she will get there just keep offering and one day shell surprise you:)|`|1WBimx1laa	At 12 months. My daughter did not want to drink from any kind of sippy cup either. I just kept trying to give her one everyday and when she got thirsty enough she would finally try drinking from it. I took the sippy cup and told her to watch me do it and she thought that was funny so she tried doing it. Usually babies have to see you do something so that they will know how to do it and they will know its ok to do it. So try that. I hope that helps.|`|staqho0Baa	I was having this same dilema about a week ago, my daughter will be 1  next week!  I wanted to get her on the cup sooner than later so we can start getting her off the bottle.  She did the same thing, just chewed on it.  We just kept offering it to her and abou 2 days ago she just started sucking it on her own.   I think they just have to get used to it and figure it out on their own.  Keep offering them and soon she should get it.|`|ZM9dPpENaa	I guess the only thing I can say is practise makes prefect, just try everyday to incourage her, and praise her when she does do it right.<br>  <br>  Have you tried those cups you tip a certain way to get the drink?<br>  <br>  Hope this helped, Meerkat x|`|NYuGc26xaa	why not try those cups with the straws built it? I never really had any sippy cup troubles.

Choose your battles... this one isn't worth fighting.  Just limit the amount you put in the open cup.  Just an ounce at a time will eliminate a lot of mess. Keep another glass with more milk handy so you can refill her glass as she drinks it.

After that, there are several other methods that can be used.  <br>  <br>  First Trimester (1-12 weeks)<br>  <br>  1. Suction curettage - The physician dilates (opens) the cervix with mechanical dilators or laminaria (a porous substance that is typically inserted a day before the abortion). During the abortion, the doctor attaches tubing to a suction machine and inserts the tubing into the uterus. The suction created by the vacuum pulls the unborn baby's body apart and detaches the placenta from the wall of the uterus, sucking the fetal parts and placenta into a collection bottle.<br>  <br>  2. Dilation and Curettage (D&C, or sharpe curettage) - This method is not as common since it requires more dilation and more time, and is considered less safe than suction curettage. The cervix is dilated and a curette, or loop-shaped knife, is inserted into the uterus to pull the unborn baby's body apart and detach the placenta from the wall of the uterus. All body parts and membranes are then scraped out of the mothers body.<br>  Second Trimester (13-26 weeks)<br>  <br>  1. Dilation and Evacuation (D&E) - At this point in pregnancy, the unborn baby's body is too large to be broken up by suction and it will not pass through the tubing. The cervix needs to be dilated more than in a first trimester abortion. This is usually accomplished by inserting laminaria a day or two before the abortion. The physician then dismembers the body parts. The skull is crushed and the spine is broken toe facilitate removal.<br>  <br>  2. Saline, Prostaglandin, and Urea Instillation - These methods, more common during the 1970's and 1980's, are rarely used now, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which reported that they accounted for only 0.7% or approximately 11,200 of all reported abortions in 1991.<br>  <br>  In a saline abortion, the physician injects a concentrated salt solution through the mother's abdomen into the amniotic sac surrounding the baby. The fetus absorbs the solution, which causes burning, hemorrhage, edema, shock, and eventually death. The saline also causes the uterus to contract and expel the baby.<br>  Intercardiac Injection<br>  <br>  At about 16 weeks, ultrasound is used to pinpoint the location of the baby's heart. A needle injects a fluid into its heart, causing an immediate heart attack, killing the pre-born baby. Used commonly in "pregnancy reduction" abortions-when multiple babies are present and some are killed to give others better chance of survival, or they are killed because of defects.<br>  <br>  Prostaglandin abortions are performed by injecting a protaglandin hormone into the amniotic sac. The hormone stimulates uterine contractions to expel the fetus, who has usually died, although a 1978 study showed that up to 7% of babies aborted with prostaglandins showed signs of life.<br>  Urea abortions are similar to saline abortions but are not as effective. Urea infusion is more commonly combined with later-term D&E abortions to soften fetal tissues for easier, safer, and less painful removal.<br>  <br>  Second and Third Trimester<br>  <br>  1. Dilation and Extraction (D&X) - This technique, does not dismember the fetus; rather, the fetus is delivered intact, without infusions.<br>  <br>  As described and performed by abortion doctor Martin Haskell, D&X abortions take three days to complete. In the first two days, the woman's cervix is dilated with laminaria in two or more sessions, with medication given for cramping. On the day of the procedure, the laminaria are removed, and the patient is injected with Pitocin to induce contractions.<br>  <br>  The abortion doctor next determines the fetus' orientation in the uterus through ultrasound and locates the legs. Grasping a leg with large forceps, he pulls the leg into the vagina and delivers the baby up to the baby's head with his hands.<br>  <br>  Next, the doctor slides his hand up the baby's back and hooks his fingers over the shoulders of the baby. Then a pair of surgical scissors are inserted into the base of the skull to create an opening. Removing the scissors, he inserts a suction catheter into the opening and suctions out the skull contents. Minus its brains, the skull decompresses and is easy to remove. Finally, the abortionist removes the placenta with forceps and scrapes the uterine walls with a suction curette.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	There are two types of abortions - one they actually vaccum out the fetus. This procedure is done when you are further along, around 8 or more weeks. The other type of by taking two medications. One medication stops the fetus from growing and tricks your body into thinking it's not pregnant anymore. The other medication expells the fetal material. <br>  Either way is not right, but if you decide this is your only option, chose the medication route, it's less painful. But you need to be sure you are pregnant and see a doctor immediately.|`|627pWyVkaa	It depends on how far along the woman is, where she lives and when she goes for the abortion. In the States, most places have two options the Abortion pill (medical) which can be taken upto 8 weeks from your last menstrual period. Or Surgical.<br>  <br>  here this site explains in detail how they do them and at how many weeks each procedure is different dependent on the size and how far pregnant a woman is.<br>  <br>    If you are thinking of one, your best to ask all questions to the people going to preform it, and research and read everything about it so you know if its what you actually want too do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/abortiontypes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifesitenews.com/abortiontype...</a>|`|fbb856fb364e1969ae9d33b1092a6feaaa	It depends on what stage the pregnancy is at. At the earliest stage you can take a tablet, at the later stages it gets a lot more medical and involved. If you are pregnant and are unsure of your options then you could contact your local family planning clinic or Marie Stopes advisory centre. www.mariestopes.org.uk<br>  <br>  I personally don't agree with abortion after about 8 weeks, just because this is when the heartbeat is developed. However, I have absolutely NO right to judge what another person chooses to do - no one does; I don't know what others' circumstances are etc.|`|3cZ4ZJPSaa	I really dont think this is the right place for a question like this. Maybe direct it to womens health. This section is designed for pregnant ladies to seek advice about their babies and pregnancies, not about how to kill a baby. Expect some harsh responses.|`|xajnJSDLaa	FIRST TRIMESTER:<br>  <br>  Vacuum Aspiration and Curettage<br>  <br>  The main method of early surgical abortion is vacuum aspiration, which can be accomplished using a handheld syringe (manual vacuum aspiration) or an electric pump (electric vacuum aspiration).(6) "In 1994, 97% of abortions were performed by vacuum aspiration (suction curettage)."(5) This method is a safe and simple way of emptying the contents of the uterus with minimal cervical dilation.(5) If necessary, the cervix can be dilated with a hydrophobic dilator such as Laminar or Dilan or mechanical dilation can be accomplished with Pratt-type dilators. A uterine aspiration cannula of appropriate size is then inserted into the uterus, and the contents are vacuumed out either manually or with an electric pump. Once the uterus appears to be empty, systematic curettage, or light scraping of the inner walls of the uterus, is performed to assess the completeness of the vacuum evacuation.<br>  <br>  SECOND TRIMESTER:<br>  <br>  Dilation and Evacuation (DE)<br>  <br>  The major method for surgical abortion during the second trimester is Dilation and Evacuation (DE). It is typically preformed after the 13th month (5) and requires the dilation or the cervix followed by the evacuation of the uterus.<br>  Dilation of the cervix can be done in a simple manner by a synthetic dilator or a natural one. Dilan, a synthetic dilator, ensures sterility and is easy to insert and remove, while Laminar is seaweed and a natural dilator. It is important to estimate the gestation age to know how much the cervix needs to be dilated. If further dilation is necessary mechanical dilators can be used as needed.<br>  After dilation is complete, a vacuum cannula is used to fully evacuate the fetus and the placenta.(5)<br>  This procedure is relatively quick and uncomplicated. The advantages of the DE method are: relatively little bleeding (as opposed to the extent of bleeding associated with medical methods), the patient does not have to undergo the trauma of labor, and the stressfulness of the procedure is apparent immediately after it is finished. The DE is cheaper than a medical abortion and is deemed safer before 18 weeks gestation.<br>  <br>  THIRD TRIMESTER:<br>  <br>  Only in extreme circumstances is abortion performed in the third trimester (see When Women Have Abortions graph on Stages of Pregnancy and Fetal Development Introduction page), and as a result there is little information on the procedure itself. Dilation and Evacuation (DE) (see Surgical Methods: Trimester 2) is the primary procedure used, but it is a more complicated procedure than in the second trimester. Because the fetus at this stage can be viable, law prohibits extraction of a live fetus. Therefore, fetal life must be terminated before the fetus is extracted from the uterus.(4) Also, as the gestational age increases so does the risk for uterine perforation, infection, bleeding, amniotic fluid embolism, and anesthetic reactions.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   HOPE THIS FULLY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.<br>  IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT HAVING AN ABORTION, I HOPE WHATEVER DECISION YOU MAKE IS THE RIGHT ONE FOR YOU.<br>  BUT PLEASE REMEMBER, A BEAUTIFUL, INNOCENT CHILD IS IN YOU AND WANTS TO COME OUT AND LIVE.

The tube goes directly into the uterus. Then it starts sucking everything out. Afterwards they have you sit down and put a heating pad on your stomach because you will be in a lot of pain. 20-30 mins later you're free to go home.|`|2GhwuXksaa	Hi Pinky,<br>  <br>  I have read through some of your answers and if you are asking because you are considering an abortion then I would advise you to take little notice.

If her period is due soon, wait until she misses it by a day, then take a test.|`|MwgYibwgaa	dude you must have F* her really hard. Now thats my style, ruff :-). You probably brake her bones or stress her body and you know what too much. Lol or she making stuff it up. <br>  <br>  Best see a doctore for right answer. Peace out. <br>  <br>  You can get pregnant test thing @ any cvs rite aids n other big name company that have pharmacy, visit a pharmacy|`|TYW2OQM5aa	She wouldn't notice the symptoms that soon. She's contracted a disease from you or someone else that she's sleeping with OR it's totally unrelated. <br>  Go to a doctor and find out for sure.|`|8Xm6tMOHaa	no she is infected.|`|FcZxmtCNaa	yeah go check with the doctor.|`|KWPnoqGMaa	to early to tell..wait until she missed her period|`|z6CBWSnFaa	sick. i'm 14... not suppose to be here.|`|gYh5L7oWaa	theres a chance i would check ur gp or doctor
uGjknmWZaa	You should pump every 2 hours to get your milk supply for at least 10 min each breast.  Even if after 5 min you don't pump milk...you still need to keep pumping to stimulate milk production.  Hope that helps.|`|26eyvWTAaa	Do at least 15 minutes on each side every three hours, even through the night. You should try to pump as much as you can because you little one will increase their need very rapidly! <br>  <br>  I had to pump for 3 months because my daughter had a bad latch. Then out of nowhere, she began breastfeeding just fine. I think that actually helped because then she wasn't dependant on breast or bottle. She liked both! Good luck!|`|a1SWQpgLaa	drink nursing mother's tea and u will get an increase in milk.<br>  <br>  p.s. add sugar to make it drinkable|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	That is no where near enough.  You need to pump every 2-3 hours day and night for 10-20 minutes.  You should aim for 20-30 ounces a day but if you are experiencing engorgement yet you could pump a lot more than that.|`|c3e2b4a98cc5c8176034e458502ba066aa	You need to be pumping MUCH more than you are. My daughter was in the NICU for 12 days, and so I pumped exclusively during that time. My lactation consultant told me to get a good double-electric pump <br>  (when I was pumping exclusively, I rented a hospital grade pump) and pump 15-20 minutes every three hours. This is as long and as often as your baby would feed. If you really want to increase your supply, keep pumping for 2 minutes after the last drop of milk.<br>  <br>   I also kept track of how long I pumped and how much milk I got from each breast. That way, I knew if I was getting more or less than the last time. It will increase slowly, but the pattern will go up. It's hard to get up in the middle of the night, but it's worth it! <br>  <br>  Good luck.
GEfpzUNvaa	ive never used those ones.. but if 2 have said no.. and you were suppose to start the 19th. then i would say your not.. don't stress out.. that will cause it to not show up...(af that is)  but good luck either way..|`|RpwYzQvEaa	They are actually very reliable, but there is always a chance for a faulty test here and there, but that's rare.  I got a positive when I tested 11dpo with that test and my daughter will be 2 years old this July!  Good luck and try not to stress.|`|oiJITSNZaa	a negative means NO and two in a row!!! what clearer answer do you need?! LOL|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Actually, first response is a very reliable test. Until your period shows there is still a tiny chance you might be, but I would say more than likely that your not. Sorry..better luck next month!
HU30GRn3aa	I'm not sure but from what it sounds like the 3rd or the 5th next month? Keep track of them every month and then you'll know more about when or around what time of the month. I'm not regular so I always know that it's towards the end of the month...I never know exact dates though.
PFO1jxZGaa	It is most likely just winter air and her drool drying up her cheeks. <br>  Eczema is really extremely dry and scaly or bumpy rash. Dry skin is dry skin. <br>  I would jsut keep moisturizing it, Eucerin is good but my daughter does really well on regular vaseline. ( she had eczema but got medicated cream toclear it) sine her eczema cleared she still has some dry patches and after bath I just rub vaseline on her and she is smooth as, well a baby :) <br>  Just wait until her next appointment and then if its still there the dr will tell you if anything else needs to be done. But I wouldnt run her to a dermatologist etc yet.<br>  <br>  edit also eczema will spread to their skin folds first ( like behind knees and armpits etc) and also to other parts of the body, like back. It they rash is only on the face its just from the rdool most ikely. If it does start to spread then take her in|`|VCUc4k70aa	You don't have to worry. Even if it is eczema it will go away on its own before your daughter grows up.  Consider: 15-20% of kids have eczema and only 1-2% of adults do.  Just stay away from prescription meds (they are either steroids or immuno-suppressants and do more harm than good).<br>  Cheers,<br>  Bernadette|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	I had a similar situation with my daughter. See a dermatologist. Preferably one that has experience with children. Good luck!|`|Zc62409caa	It would most likely be eczema. The best cure is just to wait and use a mmoisturizercalled Cerave. It works great(especially kids).
dGsgzRkFaa	Yes, my cycle is very similar.  I have a 30 day cycle, my last period was Jan. 30, needless to say I think I am pregnant.  Everybody ovulates different, I know I ovulated in the beginning of the month.  Around the 7th of Feb..  You should buy an ovulation test kit, they are priced reasonable and sold in drugstores, food stores, and walmart.|`|Wzws8v8daa	yes, that's still considered a normal cycle. anything under 35 days is normal.
nzGdMWbZaa	I have never heard of a false positive....Take a blood test. I am sending baby dust your way :)|`|afDDiHbXaa	you can get false positives no matter what anyone thinks or says.It happened to me. I got a positive then after i tested again (coz you just can't believe you finally got a positive).and every test after was negative.now disappointment sets in.i had a blood test to confirm that i wasn't pregnant.so false positives do happen and my doc said it is quite common and there is no answer why it happens.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	nope, a positive is a positive, as long as the test was done properely and you read the results in the first ten minutes then you are most likely positive, it probably just early on and different tests have different levels of sensitivity to picking up the pregnancy hormone.  wait a few days and test again or head to the doctor for a blood test to confirm.|`|oHNrktxTaa	Not sure. The only real accurate test to be sure if you are pregnant or not, is to call & make an appointment with your OBGYN & have a blood test done. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, I would try First Response Gold HPT first thing in the morning. They are pretty accurate. Also, keep in mind that your HCG levels may not be high enough for the HPT's to read.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck! BABY DUST!<br>  Keep us posted:)|`|SM4xIodaaa	false positives almost never happen bc you have to have high levels of hormones to say positive and if you are not pregnant you do not have the high level of hormones. I had a neg test one day and a positive the next.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	No, you're pregnant, unless you have been pregnant recently or are taking certain fertility medicines.|`|YmeIORrtaa	What order did they come in? I'm assuming the 4 false ones came after, in which case, I would say it possibly could have been a false positive. Also depends on how many days you waited between these tests.. if you waited a few days between each consecutive test, and once again assuming the first was the positive, I'm fairly positive that you are not pregnant. Your hCG levels double every single day.... so the later ones would be more and more accurate.|`|oybsfVqPaa	False positives are unlikely, but evaporation lines are common.<br>  It depends on the order. 4 neg, 1 pos.. or 1 pos, 4 neg.. etc.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor to confirm, just in case! It's the safest bet.|`|yayDgY0qaa	yes i do.
crrK58F4aa	very possible you don't ovulate on your own. doctors only give clomid to encourage someones body to ovulate. They don't generally give it to people who have no problems with ovulation.<br>  I only ovulate from one ovary so everyone is different.|`|sk46uigvaa	When are you testing for Ovuation??<br>  <br>  ovulation test should be taken later on in the day, i test 1pm/8pm so i don't miss my surge, i also hang onto my pee for a few hours and try not to drink too much before i test.<br>  <br>  I think you should raise this concern with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|DCKOlH13aa	Yes it is possible...Did you doctor do any tests on you before prescribing clomid or did he just give it to you? I have not been ovulating either and so I went to a reproductive endocrinologist who is going to start tests to see if there is a problem with me and if they can figure out why I don't ovulate. My cycles are also irregular which is concerning them as well. Too long that is. So to answer your question yes, it is possible that you do not ovulate on your own and only with the clomid, but your doctor should check you to see why.|`|YLXpwqceaa	Normally a person ovulates on day 13 to day 16 of their cycle.  So when I used the ovulation strips around that time I got nothing.  (I used them to prevent pregnancy at the time)  I then had the thought to test for the whole month, little pricy but worth it!  I actually ovulate on day 20 to 22.  So I was just testing early!<br>  <br>  So when I went to use them for TTC, my husband and I got it first month.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|fG727pkuaa	Hi,<br>  I have been TTC for about 5-6 months and only tested positive once on a ovulation tests and kinda gave up after. My cycles are 35-45 and it was hard to keep track of when i would ovulate. I recently purchased a clearblue easy fertility monitor and used it for the first time this month. I am on day 10 and got a peek reading! Never would i thought that i ovulated this early on, thats why i believe i wasnt getting pregnant. You should really read into the product and try it! You'll love it. Baby dust to you!

crrK58F4aa	Folic Acid is enough. You only need to take vitamin supplements for other vitamins if you are not getting enough of that vitamin from your diet alone. Having said that you can buy a pregnancy multi that contains Folic Acid, it's more expensive though.<br>  <br>  Folic Acid has been proven to reduce the incidences of babies developing Spina Bifida, so whilst people don't take these vitamins to help them get pregnant they use them to ensure they have a healthy pregnancy and baby.|`|zATQaiwIaa	M god - a prenatal should be enough, that has folic acid in it and its what women who are pregnant take.<br>  <br>  Women never used to take all this junk to get pregnant|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Pre-natal pills along with a DHA supplement.
145RUNQHaa	Sounds normal at this age they like to try and gain some control over their surroundings and the people in it!it's all part of gaining independence.they can suffer a lot with frustrated feelings at this age too so while be sympathetic i wouldn't give the tantrum so much attention next time it tends to make them even more irritated.next time she throws herself down to the floor let her know a hug is waiting and either sit nearby or get on with what you were doing.she should come to you eventually for a hug.then you can distract her.the more fuss you make the more worked up she will get so just stay calm and don't make a big deal.|`|02fjVtsFaa	i don't know what to do, because i have seen this at childcare. But what your three year old is doing, is having a tantrum. She asked and she couldn't wait. What you do is remove things around her that could hurt her while she throws a tantrum. The first answer was really good.|`|gx4s68s8aa	Sounds like my 2 and a half year old.  It is control issue.  Just the normal development of a young child.  With our daughter we always ask first "Do you need a hug, or give Mommy a hug" and Most of the time (80 percent) this will help the situation.  She comes and gives us a hug.  Then the hug calms her down to the point that we can ask her what is wrong.  If we didn't ask for the hug then she generally doesn't get calm nearly as quickly.<br>  <br>  And then sometimes the hug doesn't work and she is just mad.  At those times we just ignore her for a while.  Then a few minutes later we will ask for the hug again.  Most the time she will hug us and tantrum is over.
ZK7JztHyaa	i did six rounds of clomid and i felt like crap the whole time...every month i thought i was pregnant....i gained weight too....cd 15 is probably way too early...expect the little cramps throughout your cycles on clomid...GL and babydust!|`|E6obQSpraa	Its probably symptoms from the Clomid.  You wouldnt know at CD15 if you were pregnant, its far too early to be having pregnancy signs.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!  xx|`|06d711c37564584379b1af164dbbe840aa	The clomid is probably responsible for your symptoms.  I would say depending on your cycle length, you're at or near ovulation........doubtful if you're pregnant yet.......if you've ovulated and the eggs been fertilized, implantation may take a day or two...then you're gonna need to wait until you're late to know for sure.
c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	although it's unlikely, a woman can still get pregnant if the man is "wet" or ejaculates anywhere near the vagina.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	a woman can get pregnant even without deep penetration. A guy has a thing called pre-***... which obviously ist he *** before the real ***.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	If he comes around her vaginal opening, I believe pregnancy is possible though this is rare.<br>  <br>  If you mean he has sex with her then pulls out before ejaculation, pregnancy is also possible them. There can be sperm left in the urethra that are released.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|yL7ODtuYaa	For a woman to get pregnant she has to have sex with a man,where the sperm is ejaculated in the vagina, but if a man ejaculate out side her ,the spermatozoa can travel inside the vagina,and the woman can get pregnant,cause the spermatozoa can travel inside and lives 24 hours.|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	the penis could barely touch the vagina and she could get pregnant. they are meant to swuim thats what they are going to do. anytime *** or precum(on his penis or on his hand or any surface) comes in contact with your vagina(even the slightest bit) you can get pregnant. <br>  since you asked this question im guessing you are way to young to have sex. so dont if you havent already and get on bc now and MAKE him wear a condom|`|OUbgs89taa	It is possible to get preg from the pre come liquid.
S7F9AO7Gaa	you should wait till you miss you period cause chances are it will come up negative, i tested a week before i was due though and it did come back positive but for best results test if and when you miss|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	Yes you need to wait until you miss your next period. If you test before then it will be too early and could give you a false result.
CPwdVc4caa	Since it's been 4 weeks since your last period, and you ovulate 2 weeks into your cycle (average), it seems more likely that you conceived on the 7th.  Fetal age will be how they date the pregnancy (based on your last period), and gestational age is the age of the actual baby (from conception).|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	Okay. Back it up a little bit haha. I can tell you are excited but you are thinking WAY too far into this. Conception is different for everybody. The best thing to do is to wait til you first scan, when they will tell you your actual due date based on the babys size. That is when you can find out conception date.. however even then its not 100%|`|eGwaDKGwaa	It is not possible to know due to variations in women. Thats why doctors and midwives take it from the date of your last menstrual period. once you ovulate th sperm has 24 hrs approximately to get to that egg. however since sperm can live for a few days its possible to have old live sperm from 2 days ago waitng for your freshly ripened egg. or you might ovulate, then have sex and get some fresh sperm fertilizing the egg........ youll never know exactly when.
IH0kLuwZaa	it doesn't necessarily mean you're gay or bi its perfectly normal to have a crush on someone who is close to you at this age but don't worry it'll pass its just a hormone thing sweetheart|`|v9x3xGpvaa	if shes touchin you very lightly of course u will get chill bumps you will with anyone, do not turn gay or lesbo it is wrong!|`|rVs2nfgGaa	looks like you are a lesbian or bisexual. and most likely you are starting to get turned on when you get that feeling.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	i think you might be a bi. if you dont want her to know then keep it in or come out and tell her.

pzLDXL6gaa	You're not supposed to take birth control while pregnant, but if you mean getting pregnant accidentally while on birth control and you don't find out for a few weeks - no it shouldn't cause any harm. I don't think there's any evidence it causes significant harm to the baby. I think it depends on the type of pill though, as well as how long you were taking it during the pregnancy. Regardless, you have to stop taking birth control immediately when you find out for sure that you're pregnant, and then discuss with your doctor if they think everything is okay.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|4SFHGHyfaa	Yes. alot.<br>  Miscarriage or retardation|`|QWaspeg7aa	Birth control is for prevention of pregnancy- if you're pregnant then you clearly don't need it so why take it? If you've been taking it without realising you're pregnant then you're best to go and see your doctor, which you must be doing soon or have done already anyway and ask them. If you can't get to the doctor in the near future then ring a pharmacy and ask to speak to the pharmacist.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	Yes it will. It can cause a miscarriage. The hormones in the birth control is what is harmful to your baby. Plus when you are pregnant you dont need birth control. Its not like you can get pregnant again while pregnant.

However, if you were on birth control and found out you were pregnant, and stopped it immediately I wouldn't worry too much about it.

jw1bNJMCaa	Some women start to show very early in their pregnancies. If you have been pregnant before, your uterus and abdominal muscles may be more relaxed. Your pregnant belly may seem to “pop out” right away. At eight weeks your uterus is about the size of a tennis ball. It is normally the size of a lemon. This is not a remarkable change in size but it may cause your clothes to feel a little snugger. During early pregnancy, you may feel bloated, similar to how you feel right before your period starts. This bloated feeling, constipation, or weight gain may result in you feeling like you are showing sooner than you actually are. You probably won’t be needing maternity clothes until you are closer to the start of your second trimester. However, some women start wearing maternity as early as ten weeks into their pregnancies.|`|xubIaiZaaa	i stopped fitting comfortably into my pants at around 9/10 weeks, but everyones different,<br>  heres a link to my pregnancy pics so far, you can see how much i have grown!!! <br>  <br>  29 weeks and 3 days at the moment and due for another photo soon i think :)

Otherwise, wait until a year passes before beginning to worry.|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	because people who want babies stress to much.. you need to relax.. let nature take its course.. if you are meant to be a mother it will happen weither its having your own or adopting so dont stress..<br>  i am obsessed with children and i would prefer having my own one day but if i cant of course i will adopt so dont worry|`|c2rTAk71aa	my boyfriends alcoholic cousin got a fat drunk girl pregnant on the first try. It sucks for us healthy people who do everything in order to be at our best and then we hear stuff like that lol.<br>  <br>  I am not currently trying right now but I hope when I do it's not a struggle.|`|Q2yXaQooaa	Just a theory but it could be that there are not enough babies grown outside The Matrix. I suppose you might have to wait until the demand for bio thermal power the machines require is higher.

hA8XL17Uaa	I would take a test hunny and see what it says. If it says positive then CONGRATULATIONS and all the best for the three of you, but if it is negative you need to go to the docs and tell them what is going on, it could be some side effects from your ruptured cyst (not that i have heard of any side effect like that) it could be a number of things and maybe your not getting enough vitamins or a bit run down or anything really!<br>  <br>  Take a test babe and my fingers are crossed for you!<br>  <br>  x|`|KEoChTcdaa	Take the test. One thing I was told when I got pregnant with my son was you can have a false negative but you cannot have a false positive. I took the test a week late, and it was negative. I took it again three days later, and it was positive. <br>  <br>  It saddens me to hear that people have such a hard time having babies. Every woman should be able to have a baby of their very own. I will pray for you and I hope you are pregnant. ^_^
0VHolTVEaa	Everyone one will give you different answers but TAKE A TEST, you will no for sure whether its positive or negative. Hope its the answer you want|`|YzUPmWTBaa	No sweetie, unfortunately not. But some woman do experience implantation and early pregnancy bleeding, but it will be much lighter and shorter than a period. Have you taken a test yet? What does the bleeding look like?|`|8ZpgIHMcaa	Yes you can have normal periods all the way through.  I think that if you have any doubts at all, then it's best to have a test anyway just to put your mind at rest, because you can make yourself feel ill just with not knowing.  I hope it turns out how you want. :0)|`|1tm132Neaa	I had bad spotting for two weeks at the beginning of my pregnancy! You can still be pregnant, especially if it's a particularly short or light period. I would be inclined to take a test.|`|nXloT3Iiaa	Yes you can be pregnant and still have your period. The only sure way to find out that your pregnant is through a simple blood test at your general practitioner.|`|BNCpLcLoaa	Yes you can. My friend had her period all the way through her pregnancy. I would do a test to make sure. :)|`|5xM0XuJdaa	yes you can have a period during pregnancy, my mom-in-law did with most of her kids. it will really take a positive test to really tell and if it isn't positive go for a blood test and if it is negative ask the doc it could just be certain hormones rushing threw your body.|`|euYz39Epaa	i went through that<br>  i had my period..<br>  but if i smelt chiken i would feel realli  nauseous and sick..<br>  but i just waited and it soon went away... but if your realli concerned see a doctor?<br>  i dont think u can have ur period and be pregnant at the same time<br>  good luck|`|bExZnJVxaa	that could be implantation bleeding and not your period, although they are very similar and some women think they have gotten their period :)|`|VqmaOcUIaa	Was the bleeding your regular period? You never mentioned that..go get a simple blood test done ,this way you stop wndering..|`|ikS4bAg9aa	Yes...<br>  go buy a pregnacy stick thing from<br>  a stall and test it@@<br>  easy and cheap...<br>  mostly accurate as these symptoms..<br>  is like...<br>  ya...<br>  <a href="http://poemspoemsforlife.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://poemspoemsforlife.blogspot.com/</a>
iogL3GFVaa	I personally don't like it when people name their kids to match. I would get them all confused all the time instead of just most of the time.<br>  I like that your family used different names. I don't think that it really matters one way or another though.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I think it matters for a few years while they are all living together, but once they reach the wide world on their own, it doesn't matter at all. <br>  <br>  I don't think they are mis matched. It's not like they all rhyme of something.|`|Am54a7c0aa	I think they match, it's not like they're completely opposite and weird names. I don't think it matters too much.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Sibling names don't have to match. I like lots of different types of names, from all different cultures. They do pair well, and it doesn't matter. We only took into account the letter which the name starts with.|`|HDS3IGj1aa	they  go well together, but i really don't think it matters if sibling names match or not, but you if you have a son named william and then another named caden then it kind of matters.|`|61NKzPzMaa	They seem like good names. You have 2 N's, 3 T's and 2 S's. Nothing wrong with the names. They are nice names.<br>  <br>  I love Nicholas, Stephen, Tania, Samantha & Thomas.|`|xVYJTbSxaa	They go fine together. Myself and my siblings are Elizabeth, Victoria, Catherine and Kieron (Me). Now personally I don't like the fact that my sisters have upper class, classic names and I don't. But your names are all on the same level if that makes sense.
DDYwnut6aa	Generic Clomid is available at Wal Mart for under $10.   Talk to your Dr. to see if he/she thinks it is necessary.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Talk to your doctor about how to regulate your thyroid problems and then you shouldn't have any problems conceiving.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I doubt it....I have had hypothyroidism for 8 years almost and I conceived first try in 2007.....
6Vw5kgGgaa	OMG Change her mind before she signs that paper. Let her know it's costly to change it later.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	It's her decision,she'll probably regret it.POOR BABY!|`|Fk0EGJMSaa	vinnie??!!!  ya great name if you work at a pizza place in brooklyn!|`|G9UNW0NYaa	All I can say is that it may grow on you.  When I announced my new sons name to my mother in law, she actually got mad and made a huge fit about how much she hated it.  It was her ex-husbands name,  but my husband loved his father dearly, and he had no negative feelings for is diseased father.  It took a few months, but Charlie is just Charlie to her now, no negative ties anymore.  Long story short, hopefully you'll get used to it, or come up with a special nick-name that only you will call him.|`|jzbG6ZjQaa	Congats Gram!  Nothing you can do other than what you have been doing...Suggesting other names.  The only issue that may have an impact is if you stress to your daughter that a name is not only something that both parents are agreeable to,but the child.  Hopefully she's young enough to imagine growing up with a name like "lokey"! Maybe the thought of her offspring being teased and taunted as a result of his name will bring her back to reality...But remember, as a result of your opinion of the father,any suggestion that is presented as "yours" is gonna go out the window.  Make sure you express AND commit to taking NO credit to the choice she makes...if it is one you suggested.  <br>  <br>  Good luck grandma!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, Lokey is at least better than Aniken.<br>  <br>  No, there's nothing you can do.  This is their choice.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	First off, congrats.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it's really their choice, though I agree with you about the name.  Maybe suggest that they pick one of the names you recommended as a middle name.  At least that way the kid can pick the name he likes best, and isn't stuck with just one name.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FYiKgeN8aa	It is definitely her own choice, not yours.  You got your turn, now she has hers for names. Plus, the baby was born an hour ago, and you're already worrying about this?  There are more important things to think of.<br>  <br>  Are you sure it's the name that you don't like or the baby's father that you do not like?  Sounds like there are some serious underlying issues.|`|cG80UU5Waa	Honestly, it's none of your business--everyone gets to name their baby what they want, and your daughter needs support right now, not criticism or unsolicited advice.<br>  <br>  Also, liking star wars and anime is not the same thing as being a psycho...<br>  <br>  Congrats btw!|`|7gfNIajYaa	Congrats on becoming a gran mother.<br>  You have to realise that this is their desision,not yours. This is their baby that was just born an hour ago. I agree that I hate when people who are obsessed with movies,celebs etc and name their kids after them is selfish in the way that if I was still obsessed with the Lion King as I always will be (loved it when I was a kid),if I ended up calling my kid Simba or something,theyd hate me in later life. Lokey actually sounds like a nice name,maybe you could double barrel the name (suggest it) so that Vinnie or Gavon could be there...like Lokey-Gavin or something. I know it sounds crazy to you,I know its your grankid,but you must remember to give the Star Wars obsessed dad a chance as irritating as he may be. Hopefully he will be a good dad,but he does sound immature (he tried naming his kid Aniken...which sounds like the masculine for Anneka..still though,he might as well have tried calling the baby Darth Vadar)<br>  Good luck with it and congrats again.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Well you sound real mature for a grandmother.  It's frankly none of your business and if you don't like the name, tough luck.  <br>  <br>  And that would be completely rude to just pick a different name or a nickname and start calling him that as someone else suggested, that will probably piss your daughter off more than anything.<br>  <br>  Saying something will probably just make them angry, just deal with it, there are a lot worse things to worry about...

I wouldn't.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I don't like it, sorry. It seems too nicknamey and not that classy. I think Alexander would be a better choice.

We are giving this to our baby as a middle name if it turns out to be a boy.  I love the meaning of it too.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	It's ok, I know a girl who named her son Alexander and calls him Xander. So to me Xander feels more nicknameish.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I love it!

Extremely masculine, very handsome and it just sounds so 'powerful,' in a way.|`|lgM3xZkWaa	I think if you do Xander,you need it to be Alexander.His nickname could be Xander.|`|fQaNnV95aa	The problem with that is it might be hard to read and pronouce but i love the name.|`|afK4nv5naa	Great name for a baby boy, but in my opinion, it's kind of common already :)|`|cZLMiMQKaa	He wouldn't get teased and<br>  I don't see why it's so hard for people to pronounce<br>  It's a fairly common name <br>  I like it!!|`|HNlLQZbLaa	I love the name Xander. I would name my child Xander.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|VTkRjExmaa	Xander would be a nice name...
bAp35x7uaa	Having obsessed over charts and wee sticks the things we did diffferently for the month before we conceived were<br>  <br>  1.  We both cut out all caffeine (coffee, chocolate, tea).<br>  2.  We both stopped smoking<br>  3.  We doubled my other half's zinc intake for the two weeks prior to ovulation<br>  4.  I added magnesium and B complex vitamins to the folic acid and vitamin c, a, c and e I was already taking.<br>  5.  Had three sessions of accupuncture specifically for fertility<br>  <br>  And most importantly, we chucked away the wee sticks, stopped charting and we just got on with having a lot of fun.  Every other day until the day before ovulation, when we had sex every day up to and including the day after ovulation. <br>  <br>  It's easy to say "relax" but that's easier said than done when all you want is a baby. The best piece of advice I was given was to stop thinking of sex as a means to gaining a baby and turn it back into how it used to be when you first got together - ie, exciting, fruity, saucy, sexy and fun!.  <br>  <br>  My acupuncturist advised taking it in turns to seduce.  Each person takes alternate days <br>  <br>  It worked for us. But I have a sneaking suspicion that it was cutting out the caffeine that did the trick.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and the best thing to buy when TTC are the cheap ultra early 10miu test sticks from babymad.com.  You can get about 50 sticks for ￡20 which means you can test as much as you like without spending a fortune on first response (useless!) and clear blue (also useless).<br>  <br>  I got a faint BFP five days before my period was due. First response came back negative until a day or two after.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust to you. xxx|`|VS8mactUaa	For me I stopped trying and stop assuming I was pregnant everytime my boobs hurt, and the very first month I said Im not pregnant even tho I felt sick, I found out I was pregnant, then I had a miscarriage and a few months later I swore I wouldnt TRY to get pregnant, and then 3 months later Im pregnant again. yay, make sure baby dancing isnt a chore just relax and have fun.|`|Fj4FjEpaaa	me & my hubby were having sex 24/7 & specially on my ovulation date.<br>  but it took a while.<br>  you can calculate you're ovulation date on websites.just google it.<br>  good luck.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Might not be the answer you want to hear, but mine came through prayer and speaking scripture out loud to myself.

How many days is it regular how long is the cycle?<br>  <br>  Like I am 28day cycle to the hour. period last 3days. <br>  my baby days are day12-16 but safe to keep it a little open day 9-18<br>  <br>  these may sound odd!! but from what all i have read and seen they help<br>  <br>  Treat your body as if your all ready pregnant <br>  from, eating Habit, drink lots of water, medication you take, <br>  Take prenatal vitamin's <br>  <br>  1cup of ice cream a night! <br>  Not low fat, not diet, not yogurt! The real deal good old fashion ice cream! every night! <br>  <br>  When it comes to sex! <br>  You have an orgasm first, then he needs his turn after him or before he does put a pillow under your butt! Rest that way feet legs up 3-5mins after legs go down still rest pillow there. don't have to be big after legs go down. rest there as long as you can. <br>  <br>  Don't shower or pee anytime after you have sex. <br>  <br>  try to enjoy sex, make it fun and not stress full. not only have sex to make a baby! <br>  <br>  if your regular have sex on baby making days. if not regular have sex 1-3x a day every day from last day of period to next time you start. <br>  <br>  This may sound super odd, but i am going to put it. Sex started in water and then later in the bed, changes things and your hormones are higher b/c it feels different in the water and then when you get in bed your body is more sensitive. that would be a good way to start the night. <br>  <br>  eat light meals often, try to get enough sleep, don't push your self to much if you work out. Rest a lot, <br>  <br>  best of luck!!!|`|qIO2VHY8aa	it took us over two years, we had a minor male factor problem,  in the end needed ivf to get our bfp.<br>  <br>  once we started seeking fertility treatment from specialists it took us 5 months from start to finish, that included 1 iui 1 failed ivf cycle and then a successful ivf number 2 cycle.<br>  <br>  i am now 9 weeks pregnant with twins. i personally think prayer helps also
bvYPr0Cvaa	He has never called me lazy, but we have been in arguments before, and he has popped off "if you had a real job, you would understand". That seriously offended me and pissed me off. I take care of our daughter 24/7, and he works an 8 hour job comes home and puts his feet up for the rest of the day. And some days i have 3 of my neices also that i babysit from 6p.m.- 8a.m. I just don't understand how they can be so inconsiderate sometimes. Taking care of kids and a home is a hell of alot harder than a lot of other jobs out there, we can't just punch out a time card and leave our kids behind for the rest of the day, they need to be taken care 24/7 not just 8-10hrs of a day. Sorry for dragging it out, but i know how you feel, our husbands just need to become more considerate of all the things we do. Best of luck to you!!!|`|H41u0B8Jaa	I was never called "lazy" outright but I would get comments like "what have you been doing all day??" if dinner wasn't on the table when he came home from work or the house was messy.  What he didn't realize was I could have spent the day running to appointments with the kids or been taking care of a sick child.  It is just because if you are at home all day some men have a certain expectation of what they think you should be doing and if it isn't done they think you are lazy and have done nothing but lay on the couch all day watching TV.  Let him stay home for one week and see how much you really do!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Never.  Adults in healthy relationships don't call each other names.|`|fbqrIdkuaa	Anyone that would say that, especially to their significant other, needs to spend a few days at home with the kids themselves.<br>  <br>  Not only did my husband never say that to me, he never thought it and was actually the first person to admit that I did more before noon then he did all day.<br>  <br>  However, I do have some friends who have had to deal with this.  When it would become an issue, we would leave the kids with the daddies and go away for the day or weekend.  When we came home, it was never said again.<br>  <br>  LOL.|`|nYioXmnGaa	My husband does not say that I am lazy but his stupid mother does !!   I hate his mother . One day i went up there for Christmas so the boys could give her her present and she did not even give them a hug or kiss till i said something . So while the boys were playing she told me right in front of my husband that I should  get a job and that i am lazy and should get off my A** and do something . Have not seen her since and i am liking that ! I have no idea why  people do that but it just bugs me !!!!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	No but he has tried to guilt me about how we don't have much money and we're trying to buy a house.

mn4yu1yAaa	A spaghetti dinner is always nice and very inexpensive. Pasta is less than a dollar and you can get Hunts sauce for .99 and a pound of ground beef in the sauce. Buy a loaf of italian bread or make garlic bread. Hope it helps and congratulations!|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	I also agree with the spaghetti ideas.  Or ... if there was a special meal when you met, or conceived the baby that could be fun, sentimental and inexpensive too.  Example, order a cheap Chinese dish, like a combo & split it, if you ate Chinese food the night you met or buy a Digornos Frozen Pizza $5 & whip up a salad if you had pizza the night you conceived your baby.|`|W0gMQVoDaa	i would say either spaghetti bolognese or any pasta  bake that you can come up with,congrats by the way xx

Maybe worth asking your GP if you think you want to try it.<br>  Whether this is suitable for a 4 year old I am not sure.<br>  <br>  It must be quite distressing you you and your son to have this on a regular basis. Good luck with finding some relief for him.<br>   :--))<br>  <br>  EDIT.<br>  <br>  Hmmm  I just Googled quinine for leg cramps and found it can cause some side effects so it may not be a good solution after all.|`|fvuEtkROaa	Make sure he is wearing good, supportive, well-fitting shoes during the day.   Shoes that fit poorly or don't offer support to little feet  may cause him to walk differently during the day, putting strain on muscles and ligaments.

The pain will immediately go away. :)|`|waHqDzmuaa	Eat bananas everyday This could be a lack of potasium|`|i4bjQbPcaa	It could be a food allergy such as an allergy to wheat.

Those things hurt like hell =(<br>  <br>  but they sound exacly like 'growing pains' to me because i had the exact same symptoms, in my feet and lower legs.|`|9hggEdf1aa	My 4 year old has the same problem.

FiUprYsvaa	I don't suffer from insomnia, I suffer from something much worse. <br>  I have delayed sleep phase syndrome. <br>  Meaning I don't get tired till about 4-7am. and I sleep till about 1-6pm depending on if I have class or not. <br>  I am in college and I live at home so this works out. <br>  <br>  I have spent the last 3 nights attempting to stay up all night in hopes i'll readjust my sleep pattern for a little bit but I haven't made it past 2pm. Hopefully I will be able to stay awake this time. It'll be my 4th try. <br>  <br>  And nothing and I mean nothing wakes me up when I am asleep. My mom will try to wake me up and will talk to me and i'll talk back and won't even remember that I said anything.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My son has insomnia. lol. He's woke up at 2, didn't fall asleep until 6:30, then woke up at 7:30 for the day....I'm exhausted!<br>  I'm looking forward to his first nap so I can take one.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I have been up all night. Tried to get to sleep didn't work. Its 730 am for me|`|BWXfaJQGaa	You ain't the only one... it's horrible and i gotta wake up early in the morning :(|`|34VfDyuyaa	insomnia is very awful...<br>  hard to sleep and when you do get sleep, you easily wake up..<br>  <br>  i tried some precautions so i would sleep better..<br>  <br>  1. put all electronic devices at least 3-5 feet away from me..<br>  2. drink chocolate milk<br>  3. count from 1 to until i fall asleep (only when 1 and 2 doesn't work)<br>  <br>  try them, maybe it'll help you..<br>  <br>  oh and,,put the cat at least a door away from you..|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Yep, I had about 1.5 hours sleep, woke up at 2am, and am still up at 6.45am! <br>  I'm pretty nocturnal so my body is used to it lol, but with the new baby i'm getting less sleep than usual!<br>  Don't worry Amber, 3pm sounds like great bedtime! :)|`|cP1Asd7waa	No Im not suffering from insomnia tonight but I wish you the best of luck!|`|O1zIaoK7aa	I AM!!|`|k56mmj2eaa	yes i am a night person|`|AA10943329	it is only 11.32pm at the moment but I am normally asleep.

Hope you get to sleep soon|`|zGgUsEmdaa	I suffered last night, couldn't get to sleep till 4am in the morning. xxx
oVxr5B3Eaa	I was the EXACT same.. I started walking really early, and I walked on my toes until I was 10 or 11 or maybe even older. Everyone always made fun of me because they thought I was trying to be a ballet dancer or something but it was actually really uncomfortable to walk the right way and was much easier to walk on my toes.. It didn't hurt or anything but walking flat-foot was kind of... sore. Look for a pair of running shoes that has a bit of a heel to them, like the ones with the boucy things in them -> http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2005/11/25/... (about 1inch heal) and have them be her "indoor shoes"... she can wear them around the house.   I eventually grew out of it, but I still much prefer to wear shoes with a bit of a heal because they're much comfier.. I have no problem wearing high heels but flats actually hurt...     Good luck!|`|aSKsDtwLaa	It's not Rett's - I know a girl with Rett's, which is a horrible neurological disease marked by lack of speech, mobility and growth problems and retardation and is eventually fatal.  To suggest it is - well - way off.    There are other developmental issues for which this is an indicator.  Does she hate to swim or ride bikes?  Any speech issues?  General clumsiness?  Was she slow to socialize with peers, preferring to play next to rather than with other kids?  I know a child recently diagnosed with this disorder, name to follow, it's not something I have heard of before and it is easy to overcome with some physical therapy.|`|UrrRgmDwaa	what if you got her some of those fat burning tennis shoes. They make you lean farther back on your heels. So you have to roll your entire foot when you walk.|`|tudie6lvaa	I walked on my toes when i was a kid, I never even noticed that's the way I walked. I don't do it anymore, she will grow out of it.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sometimes kids have shortened Achilles tendons from being in johnny-jump ups, walkers, or stand up play things - sometimes it's from other problems such as Rhett's syndrome.   I am surprised she's talking so I doubt it's from Rhett's, she probably has a inadvertently shortened tendon or she does it for fun.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	swimmers do this ..they are used to walking in water  I wouldnt worry about it ..this will build stomach muscles .|`|7mhqRhJKaa	Sounds like she should be a ballet dancer - maybe she wants to be.
hieQHR0daa	Don't mention baby for a couple of weeks or so. Then find a good children's book that talks about new babies something like "What to expect when mummy is having a baby" by Laura Rader.<br>  He doesn't need to know all about birth but he needs to understand that you don;t get to chose whether baby is a boy or a girl.<br>  Reading to him and giving him the opportunity to talk about this. What is he afraid of? Why would a brother be better? or is it just the fact that there will be another child there. <br>  As someone else said you can also involve him and give him some small areas of responsibility which will help. This all needs to be done gradually as it is a very big thing for a three year old and takes longer to come to terms with so that there are fewer problems later.<br>  Good luck, I'm sure it will all work out.|`|1WBimx1laa	Yes. I would spank him and tell him not to hit mommy that it hurts very bad. Tell him when his baby sisters get here that he can help you give them baths and help feed them and put thier clothes on. Tell him that he can help you do anything with them. That he can hold them. Make him feel special too so he dont feel left out.|`|G9UNW0NYaa	All I can suggest is that for the next couple of weeks don't talk about the baby around him at all.  Focus on giving him love, spend more time focusing on him right now than you normally would.  You have time to nurture his love for a baby.  It'll take time, but maybe if it's not brought up for a while, he'll stop feeling like it's being forced on him, and he can come to terms with it on his own time.  You want to have the most positive attitude possible when introducing a new family member, it will help a lot in the months after she is born.  I hope it all goes well, I have a 3 year old boy, and they're tough!|`|AA11583804	You could give him some responsibilities such as discussing baby names with him asking him for help buying things for the baby. Children of that age love to make choices and help out so you might be able to give him some small jobs as well to do with the baby make sure you give him plenty of encouragement too.
b639f61d656c58882c6d485d251a34e1aa	I love that.  It is unique but not crazy.<br>  <br>  Also, I love your avatar name.  <br>  <br>  Have a good day!!!|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i'm not sure, i guess it depends on the first name|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I like it.  You do realize that Nero was an infamous tyrant, right?|`|L2Nde54Haa	get him a fiddle, and then burn something!!  lo lol lol|`|rgOBHB5uaa	sounds like a cartoon character|`|v3IobQCgaa	It rhymes with Zero.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I think its a little weird sounding...not a fan, sorry!|`|8WbfmK5daa	Its ok. Would probably work well as a middle as its short. Depends what the first name is though.<br>  <br>  I like it when parents have a reason for naming there child something other than they just like it. Like it has a meaning behind it or it is an important family name :)|`|AA11273571	I'm not crazy about it, but it could work with just the right first and last name, though.  <br>  How about using "Roman" as a middle name?  That's a very strong, nice-sounding name, too.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	I don't like it, but at least it's a middle name and not used that often. Just makes me think of "Nero the Zero" . Kids are cruel.|`|M5fRd5v5aa	it works really well as a middle name<br>  <br>  unique <br>  <br>  being a girl i think of cafe neros!<br>  <br>  but i don't half the boys know what this is !<br>  <br>  x|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Love it.  Middle names can be a bit different and I love the meaning.|`|Rbb3rqPQaa	Lovely.|`|BnpEoMD4aa	It works as a middle name, but it's kind of close to zero. :( Haha.|`|HNlLQZbLaa	as a middle name very cute and a good solid name...i would not do first name though...very good...may i ask what first names you thought would go with nero?<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|PmC0e6e1aa	Unique in a good way, sounds very masculine and handsome. I like it. The meaning is wonderful too!|`|VTkRjExmaa	Nero- it's a classy and timeless name...|`|ElayGlHPaa	It's different and cute
1WBimx1laa	This is so true and I dont know why kids do that. Everytime I have to get up I have to wake my daughter up but every time its my time to sleep in she is up and at em very early. I know sometimes though if you are not ready to get up. Get your kid/kids to climb in bed with you and lay down and they may go back to sleep or if you just want to lay there and get some more rest, try turning cartoons on and just lay there with them. Then you wont have to get up :)|`|YCr7zcIHaa	When you find an answer please let me know :)|`|ubkt5RQiaa	tell me about it!  on days my son goes to daycare we have to wake him and he gets soooooo grumpy. On weekends, when I want to sleep he is up at 6am!  He even went to bed late last night so I thought he would sleep till at least 7:30 but nope . . .|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Well, I never sleep in.<br>  <br>  I'm always up early, to make the most of the day. I think sleeping in is a bit of a waste, really.
aJLx0nhNaa	Potatoes?|`|w7FSmSTnaa	use cream of chicken soup and only add 1/2 can of milk instead of a whole can and mix all you veggies and other stuff you want to add. i make homemade chicken pot pie and that what i use and its very thick just like the ones you buy|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	When making chicken pot pie I use chicken soup with 1/2 can of milk..   I cook the chicken and dice it.   I dice potatoes and cook them.  I use frozen peas and carrots but I have used canned too.  <br>  <br>  Instant mashed potatoes make a good thickener for some soups and such.   Add a little bit at a time untill you get the texture right.
kSZx9cY5aa	YES definitely. You are exactly right.<br>  I would never, ever tell my daughter she couldn't use pads or tampons or anything else like menstrual cups.<br>  It's such a personal thing, in my opinion it's absolutely no ones business except the person wearing them.<br>  Wearing a tampon and having sex aren't related at all. There's absolutely no connection.<br>  These parents need a reality check.|`|dXDLeHNZaa	You are totally correct. I feel the same way, it is all up to the user, and not anyone else. <br>  <br>  My Mum would have let me use tampons from the start, she asked me if I wanted to. I've had my period for 2 years now, and I still have never worn one. It's my own personal descion.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	i agree, if the child is responsible enough for them. i think they are much cleaner .|`|JVPt99Hxaa	you are so right|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I agree. It's weird if parents make the preference on something like that.<br>  <br>  Though there are risks with tampons (like TSS) that need to be explained so if a parent didn't think a girl would be responsible, I can understand not wanting her to use them - but I think all girls old enough to have their period, and with parental explanation, will be responsible users. If not, well as you say it's such a personal thing the parents just have to let her risk it.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Well, the big deal is that their parents are probably old-fashioned, and still think that wearing tampons will break their hymens and they won't be virgins anymore.<br>  Or perhaps they think that using tampons will make them want to have sex?<br>  And then there's the whole thing about TSS.<br>  I've been using tampons for years, and I still forget to change my tampon sometimes, just because it's so comfortable, and I forget it's in there. Which would put me at risk for toxic shock. Some parents might feel that they don't want to risk their daughter's health by using tampons.<br>  <br>  That said, I agree that it's a personal choice.<br>  My mom was okay with me starting tampons, even though she herself prefers pads.<br>  It's simply gross to walk around all day with blood in your undies.<br>  I'm glad my mom let me make that decision for myself, and if I ever have a daughter, I will extend the same courtesy to her.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	It should be their choice, its their period, let them deal with it in their own way.|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	that is so right.<br>  it's personal to them tbh.<br>  they should decide - it is their body after all ?|`|alAtUXvyaa	right on mate
6eaWRGaqaa	I'm going to a new school too next year :) Well... maybe, I'm looking at schools.<br>  <br>  Breathe, be calm, take it easy. This might sound really cheesy, but honestly, just be yourself!<br>  <br>  I know being new can be really intimidating, but you basically automatically have friends! Confidence is key, and the best way to achieve it is to do the things you like to do, and take pride in them, it's part of who you are. What I recommend is that you be calm, smile (but don't be overeager), be friendly, and be sure not to zone yourself off by reading a book/ipod/magazine etc... if you find yourself without friends on the first day. They will automatically label you as a loner.<br>  <br>  Try to make other friends with people in a class that you like, if for example, you like field hockey, befriend someone who also likes sports. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you make a good impression by not being shy. Talk to everyone and just get to know everyone! Don't be afraid to speak up, don't be afraid to have a good time. Talk about anything. What do you like? Ask them what sports they play! Tell them something about yourself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)<br>  -Catherine|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Just relax and be yourself.  The good thing is your friend is going to be there and will make it more comfortable for you.  Don't try too hard and be natural and you will likely have a great time and get along well with these new girls.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Ask her what the girls wear, and be similar, not a clone.  The time to show off your own personal style is not yet.  Ask what questions you need to know, and don't be critical of anything yet.  Schools are all different, and sometimes they have reasons for doing things differently.  Don't say "at my old school we ___" because this isn't your old school.  You might ask them about the teachers, or the school food, or how long they have between classes.  Ask them their favorite classes, how long they have to change for gym, whatever you can think of, but don't make it like an interrogation where you're asking all the questions.  <br>  <br>  You'll probably find that they're prepared to like you fine.  You'll survive!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SWOeg0jFaa	At first just kind of go with the flow and blend in so you have some time to learn about the other people. Still be yourself and be confident, just hang back a little more than you would normally do. Be friendly; ask them about themselves like their favorite music or stores. Don't be too self-conscience and try to make the best out of this opportunity, just have fun. Being the new girl is hard but I'm sure you'll fit-in in no time.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	a) Be yourself. You don't want to create a false impression.<br>  <br>  b) No. Just talk about you would normally talk about. You do not have to spend the entire day talking about school. <br>  <br>  c) No. You will get used to the school eventually. Just think about how the year sevens feel. <br>  <br>  Relax. Things aren't going to be as scary as they seem.|`|QoWi0hzWaa	just go with the flow do what they do not somthing u dont want to do (drugs) just be yourself :D|`|tUsWZGWsaa	Just act like you've known them forever. You will slot right in! There's a girl in my form who was new from Spain last year, and on her first day she strolled right into the classroom, and she was really confident in the first couple of weeks. Now she's one of the most popular girls in my school. All you have to do is be yourself, be really nice and DONT BE SHY! They'll LOVE you!!x

PCDBcwI0aa	I too change every 2-3 hours, unless she has wet it, where I change it directly after.<br>  I also let her "kick free" for at least 1 hour a day. It prevents her getting sores and also prevents her skin from getting rashes.|`|H6QkoukSaa	Well I change after Sam has woken up and had a feed, then it is play time. I also change depending on if Sam has pooed or what ever the case maybe. I put Sam in a larger size nappy at night time because he doesn't usually poo at night. He still wakes once or twice so if I can just feed him and go back to sleep it is better. On an easy day with no poos I probably do about 6-8 changes. On a bad day it can be 15-20 changes and I kid you not, lol. On the bad days we usually go through a change of clothes every nappy change because he poos everywhere, including all over me, lol|`|uLdeIhHqaa	I tend to change my Daughters when she awakens, before she takes her morning nap, after she awakens from her morning nap, after lunch, after her affternoon nap, before supper, and before bed...and of course more if required. So on a normal day I change it about 7 times per day.|`|955YoHvVaa	My daughter has slowed down with the peeing and pooping-shes 13 months old and I think I change her maybe 4 times a day unless she obviously has done a stinky or shes decided to fill her diaper more than usual..but when she was that age I changed her about every 2-3 hours or as needed..|`|DJ24ceDJaa	<a href="http://allforyou.amstrad.at" rel="nofollow">http://allforyou.amstrad.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|ZBc16tOvaa	about 8 times a day but i usually change her half way through a feed it wakes her up a bit or she will sleep and wake up an hour later for the rest of her feed|`|B2gdBCBbaa	My baby #1 is on the way, but my 1 y/o niece was changed about 7 times per day at that age.|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	Sounds about right.|`|5udXQ79Laa	They told me at the hospital to change the diaper every two hours or so unless needed before that.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Probably every 1.5 to 2 hours, and then of course others as needed, ie #2 diapers, since she likes to go right after I put a clean diaper on!  Also, usually right before a nap, just so she doesn't wake up because of being wet!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter is 7 months old, I still change her every two hours or so.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	I don't have any in diapers anymore as my youngest is 9 years old but I am a nanny for twin boys who are 10 months old and I change their diaper every two hours unless they have a pooh in between.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I probably change my son every 2 hours, unless he's obviously done a stinky and we can smell it across the room.

I would probably say I do every 2 hours....Shes 9 months and has not had a diaper rash yet..|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Every 2-3 hours, and as needed (if diaper is soaked or is poopy).
fbqrIdkuaa	Time.  It's a pretty simple answer that I think most people would agree on.<br>  <br>  The problem is not the theory, it is the implementation.  I hear so many people say "Oh, I would love to spend more time with my family, but I have to work to pay the bills."  Sure you do.  BUT you don't have to have so many bills.<br>  <br>  It has been proven that most families do not actually make more income with both parents working.  Once you pay the daycare, second car costs, clothes, food, etc., you not making anything worthwhile.  <br>  <br>  Years ago a very wise friend told me that 20 years from now my daughter would not care if we drove a new car or if we had big house or if she had all name brand clothes.  But, she would remember that I had time for her.<br>  <br>  *DISCLAIMER - This obviously is in regards to people that have a choice.  I am well aware that many do not.|`|AA12245468	I believe time is more important.<br>  It's kind of a catch 22 though.<br>  I don't like working all the time, especially during part of my kids visits.<br>  You can give your child all the time in the world, but if you can't provide basic essentials, time spent with your children can't replace that stuff.<br>  Nothing wrong with being an at home mom or dad, I was at home with the children for some time too not so long ago.<br>  Those of us who do have to work regret not having as much time to spend with our kids though.|`|oIyXMnmcaa	To each their own--I personally think time is better but I have a great man that provides for us so I can stay home with the kids. I mean, its a demanding world out there today and alot of parents just want whats good for their kids and what will make their children happy; whether it be brand name clothes or the newest cell. <br>  There is also so much change and evolution in regards to women and the role we play these days. It is not normal for a women to be working 13 hour days out side of the home...women are striving for independance and thats all cool but its not my thing. I know that I belong at home here with the little ones--I am old fashioned though and this time I have with them is precious...more precious that hours and a paycheck.|`|ZBc16tOvaa	time is way more important even as a stay at home mum id would put down the iron and spend time with the kids before anything i dont want them to remember me as a house freak who couldnt spend time with them|`|BnpEoMD4aa	Time, definitely. And that's something money can't buy back, either.|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	i believe time is more important|`|aMpMFLo3aa	whats more important is time :)|`|z6CBWSnFaa	time. cuz u can't buy it back.|`|H6QkoukSaa	I think that time is important in the early years. Once kids go to school and start having their own social lives then you can work to save for holidays and brand name clothes. Eventually your kids are not around as much as they use to be, so you might as well do something for your own future and theirs too.<br>  <br>  Which is why I'm doing my Uni degree while my kids are little, I can spend time with them while leisurely doing my degree, once they are all at school I can return to work in a part time capacity while everyone is adjusting, then go full time. I really want to be able to go on holidays with my kids because once they get older it is one of the few times you can just be together as a family.<br>  <br>  I can't leave all the bill paying to my partner or he will be working until he is over 80. I would like us to be able to retire together and live out our lives without having to worry about money.<br>  <br>  You do have to consider your kids, but your own future too, depending on your own individual situation.|`|ThnKiLfTaa	Time!

tQPvv0Glaa	No, your cervix didn't grow back.  Like someone else said, it's not an exact science because they're just using their fingers as a measurement guide, and since everyone's hands are different size, every person that measures you could come up with a different number.  As far as being 60 or 80% effaced, in the big picture it doesn't really matter (because the baby isn't coming out until you're 100% effaced) but what does matter is that you are making progress!  Good luck!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It's not an exact science.  All they do is stick their fingers up there and feel around.  I heard a variety of different opinions during my induction.|`|UZEEKKPeaa	Your cervix isn't 'growing back'. It thins or flattens for delivery. You can be a # of cms dilated and have it go backwards. Also, these cms are people's fingers, not a ruler. If the 2nd doc was smaller, different reading. Relax about it. You'll know when it's time.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Gee, I'm not sure on this one.  Maybe it is a slight difference of opinion?  Maybe it is like baby being 3/5ths engaged one week and 2/5ths the next.  I guess things could change a bit with the cervix as well. But I'm not really sure.

Also, sometimes it can signigfy that there is internal bleeding somewhere in the digestive tract, but that's not likely on a baby who doesn't eat the same foods as we do. It could be dehydration. My mom is a nurse and she told me one time that if your stools are black it can also just simply mean that your body used all the nutrients from whatever it was you ate and that sometimes a little black poop can be a good thing :)|`|aaea8aaa8ff942ba772575e135b0c3d1aa	I am sorry to hear about your poor baby's sickness!!!<br>  <br>  A few reasons are possible.

SWOeg0jFaa	You're caught up in consumerism, don't worry, most of us are. See, I think this is a psychological problem but I may be wrong. I think that you are not satisfied with your life and you want a change; something new and exciting but you don't know how to get it so you turn to materialistic things to temporarily satisfy yourself. But as you are figuring out, they do nothing in the long run. Next time you have an impulse that says "quick, buy this!" or "I want to be different. I'm going chop all of my hair off", take some time to think about it! Will *this* finally make you happy or is it just a spontaneous action? Spend some time thinking about things you are interested in and things you hope to accomplish in the future. Think about what kind of a person you want to be and your purpose in life. Then learn to devote your time (and money) to something worthwhile and satisfying instead of spending it on something worthless.|`|sIX1nhCFaa	Maybe you should see a psychiatrist not that your crazy but he/she could answer those questions.

Enjoy ur life as it is goin on and no saying if money is flowing from ur own pocket and if u really want something then dont sacrifice it.

EFc8VGwRaa	hi, it is quite hard at first because you have to try and get the right position for you to feel comfortable and the baby needs to learn how to latch on properly which the nurses should help you with.<br>  there are many ways of doing it but personally i found it easiest for the first 2 weeks to have a pillow beside me while sitting up and have the baby lay beside me on top of the pillow with just the babys head popping around the corner and feed that way as he/she latches on easier and is much easier to hold they call it the "football hold". it feels quite sore and painful to begin with (but dont give up) because you have to learn how to latch the baby properly and all your milk is coming in throughout the first few days so its like oyur breasts are burning and feel heavy and full. ( after 1-2 weeks you should be very comfortable and find it so easy to do its just those first few days that are hard). <br>  the bond is good because my lil man looks up at me eveytime and does a little smile and it makes you melt with such joy.<br>  most people dont try because they think it is easier to make a bottle which isnt true OR they like to have the freedom of being able to drink and go out and some people just cant do it.<br>  <br>  pumping isnt hard the best time to do it is first thing in the morning as you are fullest then and also another good time is when your baby is feeding as the other breast starts to bring the milk foward and make for alot of milk which should be enough for the babys hours away from you.<br>  how long it take4s depends on the person some people can produce alot of milk some cant so that is up to your body but shouldnt take more than 20 mins to get a good amount.<br>  you can store it in the fridge for a couple of days or try freezing it in containers that are made for freezing milk( you can buy from baby shops) or just a plain clean ice tray (covered) as it holds good amount and is alot easier to get out and that can last for a while..<br>  <br>  people should understand that you dont want them in the room as it is awkward i only wanted my partner with me when i feed but after a while you get used to having it out that you dont end up caring..usually after baby is cleaned and checked over they stick him.her on the breast to feed and try to get him/her to latch on..<br>  <br>  i think i have tried to answer all your questions and good luck and dont give up as it does get easier and easier to do it, it is just those first few days that people think this is too hard but trust me it isnt..<br>  and congrats on trying to breast feed and good luck to you<br>  <br>  xx|`|yipMDefBaa	Firstly you are already doing great.  Reading up and asking questions is a great way to prepare yourself.  I agree with all the advice that is suggested in the posts above.<br>  <br>  They put my son on the breast straight away after he was born.  I was really shy at first.  More with people i knew but now if I need to feed my son I just feed him.  Most people are polite and look away and after you have been doing it a while there is no more OMG she just got her boob out and then put the baby on it.  I now breast feed in front of my male friends, even the crude male who was in the navy for 10 years.  Hey I even feed in food courts of majour shopping centers because the parents room is dirty and uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Breast feeding is the best and OMG its also the cheapest.  Formula end up being expensive.  I would rather spend that 100 bucks saved on a new educational toy for my son.<br>  <br>  I won't lie to you, breast feeding at first is not always the easiest thing.  The first 3 days you give the baby colostrum.  This is very concentrated and nutritious with your antibodies to protect him from infections.  After day 3 your "milk comes in" and your breast are the size of footballs.  Use cabbage leaves, it will help relieve them.  Later on you can pump to relieve over full breasts. Some babies just latch on and that is it no problems.  Other have difficulties including cracked nipples,  baby won't attach or even Mastitis.  It is worth persevering.  If you need to see a lactation nurse/specialist.  They are very helpful and can talk you through any problems.  My worse fear is that my baby wasn't getting enough milk but all my fears and questions were answered.<br>   <br>   Pumping isn't hard once you get used to it.  Just make sure you get a good pump.  I suggest amedla purely yours.  a little pricey but a very good pump.  You can also often hire them.<br>  <br>  Just remember get the support and help from those around you.  You will be surprised by how much you know instinctively.  Take ALL advice with a grain of salt.  A lot of things that our mothers and grandmothers do has changed, as things go in and out of fashion.  So i suggest to Listen to all advice, try suggestions, read books and then decide what YOU want to do and stick to it.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I've noticed with my husband that his hormones have shifted even more esecially in the begining when he saw me breast feeding as if more prolactin was release in his body, so this in turn (in my opinion) lowers his sex drive even more, so he will be concentrating more on you and the baby. I did not find it hard to start breastfedding at all, basically all you have to do is put the nipple in their wide open miouth and they'll know how to do the rest. Maybe I was lucky but I also feel that confidence in yourself and your body help. I pumped after every feeding I did to drain the rest of the breast because demand does create supply, the more you exmpty your breast the more they will fill. Pumping is not hard as long as you relax, it helpful for new mother who can't stimulate their let down to have the baby nursing on the other side to help with that. Pumping ccan last as little at 10 min as long as an hour. But if nothing is coming out do no tkeep the pumping suction on your nipple it can bruise it. If stored int eh back of fridge (where it the coldest) it can last 5 - 7 days. Int he freezer three months again at the back so it will keep the coldest. In a deep freezer it can last 6 - 1 year. Inform your family before hand that they will be invited in when you are ready for them to be ther ie after your started breastfeeding. The baby should go straight to your nipple as soon as possible, you won't have milk yet but colostrum which is very good for the baby. If you need more help Try www.llli.org they can help you find a lactation specialist. Also try and find a breastfeeding support group since no one in your family has breastfed, I am fourtunate to haev ammother-in-law who has breastfed all eight of her children. Above all don't get discouraged or frustrated, the baby will pick up on it get upset. Put the baby down if you feel you need a moment to collect yoruself and relax.  Oh and at the hospital they shoudl have a lactation specialist to help you out be sure to ask for one right away. <br>  Also try if needed <a href="http://traditionalmedicinals.com/womens_teas/product/29" rel="nofollow">http://traditionalmedicinals.com/womens_...</a><br>  and<br>  <a href="http://www.healthyapproachmarket.com/shop/product_view.asp?id=83400&StoreID=67DABE329C6F48829A09CD9AB0A0C044&private_product=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthyapproachmarket.com/sho...</a><br>  Both have helped me when my supply waned.<br>  If nothing else get some fennal and fenugreek to make teas out of to help your milk supply.|`|RdprMxoUaa	Breast milk is designed perfectly for human babies. It has all the nutrients and disease fighting factors they need, whereas cow's milk or goats milk is designed for baby cows and goats, so although it has some nutritional benefits for humans it has no where near the benefits of human breast milk.  <br>  <br>  Here's what happened to me: I loved it and hated it at the same time. It's not as easy as is made out by some. Breast feeding for me was at first frustrating because my milk did not come in for a few days and bub was STARVING. When he did start feeding it was hard to work out how to get him on right. Then it was excruciating as he made my nipples crack and bleed from sucking so hard. It was messy when he would pull off too early and my milk would squirt everywhere or I would leak through the night and wake up in a puddle. It was awkward when I was out and could not find a good place to hide and feed him in private. This is the bare honest truth. It is HARD. BUT I WOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN IN A FLASH. The bond you feel when it is working well (which did happen eventually) is beyond describing. Despite all my troubles I am still breast feeding and my son is nearly 1 year old.<br>  <br>  Pumping is great as it gives your sore nipples a chance to heal and you can freeze milk for another time if you need to. When I was pumping for every feed I did it before the feed time and then give it to him straight after. If I could I would try and pump in between feeds aswell so I could have a reserve in the fridge just in case he was hungry or if I needed someone else to feed him for me. The more you feed or pump the more milk you will have. Pumping always took a little longer than direct feeding but my son was a super speedy feeder. About 10 mins to feed direct from breast, about 20 mins to pump. Everyone is very different though.<br>  <br>  Tell your and his family firmly, but nicely that breast feeding is awkward and you need to learn how to do it in private. Believe me when it comes to your baby you will learn really fast how to be assertive and say what you mean. I did not even let my family hold my son until he was over a week old! You say what you want to happen and don't worry what others will say.<br>  <br>  You sound like a very devoted mother-to-be and I'm sure you will do fine. Just keep reading all you can and if its availabe do a parenting and birthing class.|`|kw80YHMLaa	It depends on whether your milk will come i  or not. Some mothers are physically unable to breastfeed. But well done on making that step it is very rewarding to be able to give your child the best in life, don't worry about people looking if u are in public use a big scarf or towel. when u express milk by pumping it last for a while as it is sterile for your breast. Breast feeding can be a little uncomfortable to start off but benefits and sense of love for child will prevail|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	It will also help prevent ovarian and breast cancer later in life, and it's cheaper!<br>  For some people, it's very easy. Others have to fight for it, and in some cases, some just can't do it. I have a breastfed baby and a formula fed child - I can tell you that's it's not essential for bonding with the baby, but there is something very special about having that one experience that only you two share. It can be painful for the first couple of weeks, but it does pass. Some people don't try because they don't feel comfortable with the whole breasts and nipples thing - society now tells us that breasts are sexual, which of course they are, but their original purpose was and is for feeding! Some people just can't get past that though, for whatever reason.<br>  Pumping is tricky, try to feed directly for as long as you can, then pump around the times that baby is due to be fed, so that your body gets used to it. You can tweak the timing when you figure out how your schedule will be. It lasts (and some debate this) up to 48 hours in the fridge and up to 3 months in the freezer. Some say longer, some say less - I stick by this one. You can breastfeed immediately after birth, and the sooner you try, the easier it will be established.<br>  I didn't have much support, which was how I came to be formula feeding within 2 weeks of my first daughter's birth - but you need to be able to ask when you need help. There is lots of support, but often you do need to look for it. I don't know where you are in the world, but in the UK, you can contact your local NCT, or La Leche League for support. Try to find out what's available to you before the birth - you might not need it, but it's best to have the details handy just in case.<br>  Good luck!|`|f9473fa380913d1942ffc2e79943f65eaa	You are going to nurse your baby that is terrific. contact la lech That is a league of breast feeding moms someone will help in hospital many moms sail right through breast feeding and do it while they work. Pumping the breast is perfectly normal and it will create a beautiful bond with your baby . you stay with it the rewards are plenty full.|`|G9UNW0NYaa	I'll try to answer all of your questions!  I've nursed and pumped for 2 babies, and I'm planning on doing the same for this one.  It is good for the baby, and for you, you cited the most popular reasons, but I'll add a few.  You never have to carry around bottles or powder.  If your baby is hungry, sit down anywhere and feed.  I used a carrier and was able to nurse while I did small chores.  It's a really neat experience to know that your body can solely provide all the nutrition for your child.  When you go back to school, you will probably have to pump once while there.  You need to ask if they have a private room you can use, because I've never been willing to pump in a bathroom.  Yuck.  You pump when your baby would normally eat.  Every 2 hours in the beginning, usually.  So if you're gone for 3-4 hours, you feed her before you leave, pump once while gone, and feed her as soon as you get home.  Your body will tell you when it's time to pump. It's a strange sensation to get used to at first!  Most people carry a small insulated lunch bag.  They sell ziplock backs in the bottle section specifically designed for breast milk.  You just keep it on ice until you get home.  It's good for 1-3 days in the fridge, and 3 months in the freezer.  When you are learning to breast feed at the hospital, the nurse will be able to help you.  Trust me, your family won't want to stick around for the tutorial!  But if they don't get the hint, tell them to go leave for a bit so you can have some privacy. It takes a while to learn for some people, so get all the help you can while in the hospital.  Once you're home and able to nurse, don't worry about doing it in front of your family.  Use a blanket for modesty, and no one will see anything you don't want them to.  I've never understood why some women think they need to hide while they nurse.  I always used a blanket to cover myself, and some people were still incredibly uncomfortable around me.  Oh well.  La Leche is in most areas, look them up online or in the phone book.  They can answer questions and provide support.  I hope I helped - feel free to e-mail me if there's anything else!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I would read the Womany Art of Breastfeeding its written by the La leche league and has their contact numbers in it or Im sure you could look it up online. The whole book has  great info on everything from all the benefits. getting started, pumping while at work and dealing with some fo the issues that could arise.<br>  <br>  I would sya the more informed youa re, the betetr chance you will ahve of sticking with it. The first 6 weeks can be really tough and the more support you have the better. Everyone will probably be like oh its easier to bottle feed, and when youa re having trouble it will look really appealing but I encourge you to stick with it and not give up!<br>  <br>  You should start rbeastfeeding within an hour after birth to give your baby colostrum, the milk that is there before your real milk comes in, this has vital nurtients nad protects your babyfrom infections and diseases. Its all your baby needs until your milk does come in ususally within 2- 5days. Tell the nurses at the hospital that you will be breastfeeding and don't want your baby given a bottle or pacifier and he/she should be brought to you whenever he/she is hungry.<br>  <br>  As for your family, I would start telling them now tat way you can know their reactrion and have lots of time to respond. Trust me, nothing is worse than you ahvinga  tougt time rbeastfeeding and having people tell you all the time how you should be bottle feeding. Better get it over with now and tell them that you appreciate their opinion, but for the first few months all you want is support, not anything else. Explain to them all the benefits and how important it is to you adn your baby (write down a list if it helps) remember it also saves abnout 1,000 dollars in formula too! Good luck and lots of reading (and sorry for the typos my 9 month old is crawling all over me)|`|hfHnjjmXaa	Hi, breast milk is the best for the baby. I believe u  can find tons of information in the web about the benefits of breastfeeding. I can't brief u much abt letting ur baby latch on cos mine were born prematured so their mouths werer too small to latch on. so i pumped. Pumping is more convenient (of course we are missing the 'bonding' part), tho my babies n i bonded very well despite me pumping my milk for them. ;p)<br>  someone else can do the feeding for u especially at night when u need to sleep. However, when u pump, u need to do more washing and sterilizing the pums n milk bottles.  Ur breast will tell u when u need to pump, normally every 3-4 hours your breast will feel so full (engorged) that u know it's time to pump. Sometimes milk will leak out so breastfeeding mums need to prepare breast pads too. YEah pads for breasts n pads for below... we feel so padded. hahahahaha.<br>  u pump till your breast is out of milk, while u pump, u keep massaging, pressing n pushing, u'll know when no more milk comes out means it's time to stop. Breast milk when store in the fridge can be used within 48 hours, in freezer is three months, in room temperature, 4hours. (be sure to label each bottle, date n time of the pump)<br>  <br>  if u need to sterilized ur milk bottle n bring it along to school to pump, keep it close n do not open after sterilized until time to pump. Sterilized bottles stay sterilized if not opened for 12 hours . all the best.|`|mnztkB6vaa	Breastfeeding is so good! Its can be quite hard to start with though. A major benefit is the ease of b/f compared to bottle feeding. I am still breastfeeding and my babe is nearly 8 months. I also went back to part time work at around 6 weeks. <br>  <br>  What i do is express milk at work about 2 hours in (you have a right to leave and have an express break!!) but try and find a quiet spot and get a mag to read. Then the milk i expressed will be used for his feed the following day. I usually keep it in an insulated bottle bag with a cold pack, and refrigerate it when i get home. Pumping is actually quite easy, They are good when you are have full breasts when your milk comes in and need to get some out for comfort. (try to freeze the excess for whenever) I use an avent isis manual one and its so easy. Also fridge milk lasts for up to 3 or 4 days and frozen is up around 4 - 6 months. <br>  <br>  If you are wanting privacy when you start at the hospital, just ask the midwives, they are great, they will be with you when you try and close the door and put the curtain round, let them know you dont want visitors. <br>  <br>  I seriously think that breastfeeding is one of the biggest things you will be learning in the first couple of months and it is hard to get started, but once you get used to it, it is so great, i absolutley love it.<br>  <br>  But im not gonna say there are no bad things, becasue with my first babe i had cracked and bleeding nipples and with my 2nd i have had mastitis once. but you get over that and learn to prevent those things from happening! <br>  <br>  good luck :)

pzLDXL6gaa	I don't know or know of anybody who has. It's a pretty effective contraceptive. I believe because it's an anti-androgen it can cause some birth defects (I think only to male babies though?) though I don't know how long into the pregnancy you would have to take it for that to happen. If you don't get a withdrawal bleed during the placebo pills, take a pregnancy test and/or see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Harriet
AA11283706	It's a fair bet to BD every two days from day 10 to 18 for a normal cycle. The best way of knowing for sure is to buy the clearblue fertility monitor. It is expensive, but really worth it. You then buy the testing sticks as you need them (there are 30 to a box).  <br>  Remember that when you ovulate your CM should be the consistency of raw egg whites. Also, it is beneficial to BD right before you ovulate, as well as during. The best way of knowing this is using ovulation test sticks. I have had a lot of luck with them. If you buy the ovulation test sticks (without the monitor) you should test right away. You are roughly at the mid point of your cycle which is usually the time you ovulate. Since you are BDing every two days, your chances are really good that you can conceive anyway! Best of Luck!|`|GEfpzUNvaa	like they say.. and its just "that easy"  haha right ... relax i guess. trust me i know its not that easy.. but yeah baby dance every other day.. we r in the same boat with you. so good luck and **baby dust**

cWuumdy7aa	Almost every country in the world, as well as the United Nations, has procedures and recommendations for how to properly classify the geographic details of an in-air birth. The United Nations considers a child born in-flight to have been born in the airplane's registered country. Some countries point to the city where the child first disembarked the plane as the place of birth, and to the airplane's registered country as the place of citizenship. Of course, citizenship and birthplace are two different topics -- citizenship is typically a larger issue and may require some paperwork, while writing a child's birthplace on a birth certificate is often a less legally significant consideration. <br>  <br>  For simplicity's sake, we'll focus here on U.S. documentation procedures, which vary from state to state and even from county to county. The state of Texas offers excellent details on how to document an in-air birth on a plane bound for Texas, even if the birth takes place over, say, Australia. Using a Texas birth certificate, you fill in the county and city of birth with the county and city where the child was first removed from the plane, and you should include a citation of where the birth shows up in the aircraft's flight log. For the location of the structure where the birth occurred (which is typically the city and county of a hospital), the county should be "In flight," and the city should be the name and flight number of the aircraft and the latitude and longitude coordinates of the point over which the child entered the world. <br>  <br>  Filing the physical birth certificate is another area that gets complicated when the birth is at high altitude. According to U.S. law, if you were looking for the birth certificate for a child born on a U.S.-registered plane (or ship), you'd have to figure out if the vessel was heading away from the United States or toward it when the birth occurred. For an outbound flight, you'd likely find the birth certificate stored at (or accessible through) the U.S. State Department. If the flight was inbound and landed somewhere in the United States after the birth, you would contact the county where the plane landed to find the record. <br>  <br>  Considerations of citizenship, like birthplace, vary depending on which governing body you contact for an answer. U.S. authorities would tell you that if a child's parents are both citizens of the United States and at least one parent has resided in the United States before the child's birth, the child is automatically a U.S. citizen regardless of the altitude of the birth. The same applies to a case in which one parent is a U.S. national and the other is a U.S. citizen who lived in the United States for at least a year before the birth. Many countries also grant automatic citizenship to a child born on a vessel that is registered to that country, so it's likely that an in-air birth could result in dual citizenship. <br>  <br>  According to British Airways, which prohibits women from traveling in the last month of pregnancy, in-air births are rare. But they do happen: The airline's Web site reports about one delivery per year onboard a British Airways flight. Crew members are trained in birthing procedures in case one of their pregnant passengers can't wait until the plane lands.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	There was actually a baby born on an airplane not too long ago. She was African, I do believe, but the plane was over Canadian waters when she gave birth, so the baby has Canadian citizenship.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	it highly unlikely a women would give birth in an airplane, they don't let you fly when your so many months pregnant.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	As far as I know in US they don't let you in the plane if you are 36 weeks or 9 month pregnant.
j45Q2ipRaa	You may want to pose this question of the formula to your pediatrician.  <br>  <br>  Good Starts is a good formula.  My daughter-in-law used it when she quite breast feeding my grandson.  She had the same issue and put a small amount of Karo syrup in to start and get him to taking the bottle, then tapered it off as no one want the baby on added sugar.  The bottles that she used as I did with my son were the Platex nursers.  There are options for the flow which may be what your little one needs.<br>  <br>  If bottles just won't work, it may be time to start the sippy cup.  No on says that they have to be on a bottle.  Just make sure he gets enough to drink.|`|d1wXxd9paa	I had the same concerns when I weaned my son... I stood in the grocery formula aisle for about 3 hours trying to decide.  I went with Enfamil A+ and I couldn't be happier.  Not only is it a great product but also they are a great company.  Constantly sending coupons and information.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I can't help you much on the formula, but as far as the nipple.  I use the Playtex Vent-Aire Advanced bottles with the WIDE fast flow nipple.  It resembles a breast more so than a standard sized nipple.  I'm not sure if they come in latex though.|`|B2gdBCBbaa	Similac advanced or Infamil with iron, best choice.|`|68c6B8dRaa	"Will I need to wean when baby gets teeth?<br>  Many people think that when baby gets teeth and has the ability to bite, then the nursing relationship has ended and it's time to wean. Not true! If your baby is nursing properly, then you should not feel teeth, even if baby has a mouthful of them. And keep in mind that it's physically impossible for baby to nurse and bite at the same time, because the tongue covers the bottom teeth/gum when baby is nursing.<br>  <br>  Some babies never bite, but biting is a behavior that most babies do try, usually when they are teething. Rest assured that biting can be stopped with a little persistence on the mother's part.

They contain more casein which makes them less like breastmilk and far harder to digest.  Follow on formulas are also more like the formula from 10 years ago in their choices of fats and other ingredients, and they can be more expensive even though they are cheaper to make and made of inferior and less processed ingredients.<br>  <br>  Adding a small amount of alcohol-free vanilla extract or artificial vanilla extract sometimes helps to get a breastfed baby to take formula, however many will not drink it if they haven't had it before 3-4 months, it is just that bad tasting.  You try tasting it.<br>  <br>  At this point you can wean him to a cup if you choose.  Otherwise unless you were planning to continue nursing it doesn't matter if the nipples on the bottle are like yours, all that matters is that he drinks from them.<br>  <br>  Biting you to deal with a fast flow is a clear indication of a poor latch.<br>  <br>  Be careful not to wean to quickly, because you have an overactive letdown, a less than great latch, a baby that bites and probably causes damage, and many other risk factors you are already at high risk of plugged ducts, mastitis, and breast abscess which could require surgery.  Rapid weaning also can cause post-partum depression from the rapid changes in hormone levels.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.com/reading_room/what_should_know_formula.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding.com/reading_roo...</a><br>  In the meantime, commercial infant formulas are not only distant in composition from human milk, but various brands of synthetic milks aren't even comparable to one another. Contrary to what the name implies, there is no fixed "formula" for commercial synthetic milk. Content and quantities of nutrients vary widely between brands and types of formula (soy, cow's milk, and meat-based). According to formula manufacturers, a pediatrician should recommend an appropriate brand and type of formula for each particular baby--advice implying that each baby's nutritional needs are unique and that physicians can recognize these special needs upon examination and select a formula accordingly. This is, of course, neither accurate nor possible.<br>  <br>  Compositional variance between formulas persists because manufacturers must attempt to simulate a product for which they do not have the recipe - a fact FDA officials recognize in their recent statement that ". . . . the exact chemical makeup of breast milk is still unknown." As Marsha Walker notes, "Formula-fed infants depend on products which can be quite different from each other, but which are continually being found deficient in essential nutrients . . . These nutrients are then added, usually after damage has occurred in infants or overwhelming market pressure forces the issue." <br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100.asp#T031014" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100.asp...</a><br>  FOLLOW-UP FORMULAS<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  May taste better. Because it is basically milk, it tastes more like milk. <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  <br>      * Casein/whey ratio different from human milk. Basically, Carnation Good Start Follow-up is like the older version of Similac: 82 percent casein and 18 percent whey, plus calcium and a newer fat blend.<br>      * Sweetened with corn syrup. The rationale for replacing lactose in the milk with corn syrup is to get it to taste sweeter. In our opinion, using corn syrup as the prime milk-carbohydrate source in an infant under a year is nutritionally unwise. Besides insuring proper nutrition, one of the main goals in feeding an infant over six months is to shape young tastes toward the normal taste of fresh foods. Corn syrup is a sweetener and certainly shouldn't be part of a food babies eat several times each day. Our conclusion: we do not recommend follow-up formulas that contain corn syrup. They are nutritionally unwise and unnecessary. Better to give your baby a higher volume of standard formula (growing babies need more fluid anyway), plus calcium and iron-containing solid foods. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100.asp#T031014" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100.asp...</a><br>  These rubber and silicone subs come in a variety of contours all claiming to imitate the natural action and shape of mother's breast. None do! Orthodontic- type nipples insert farther back into baby's mouth, allowing a more natural milking action of the tongue, but inconveniently require a "which way to turn the nipple" decision. Be sure baby sucks on the widened base of this nipple, not just the tip. The expandable nubbin-type nipples are designed to elongate during sucking but only if baby opens his mouth wide enough and sucks hard enough to draw the nipple farther in. Most, however, only suck on the protruded part. This nipple should be avoided for the breastfeeding baby, who may learn lazy latch-on habits from it. The easiest is the standard bulb-type with a wide base that best allows baby to form a tighter seal.<br>  <br>  For the full-time bottlefeeding baby, simply experiment with various types of nipples to see which one works best for your baby. If baby is both breastfeeding and bottlefeeding, use a nipple with a wide base.<br>  ===============<br>  PS If you are just choosing to wean because that's your choice don't be whingey and whiny and use all sorts of excuses.<br>  <br>  If you give inaccurate breastfeeding information lactivists such as myself are going to correct it -period.  Most of us don't really care whether you choose to use formula or not -but there is way too much misinformation out there about breastfeeding, and it makes it much harder for those women who DO want to breastfeed but run into problems.<br>  <br>  With the exception of chemo and radiation there are very few medical conditions that can't be treated while mom continues to breastfeed which is best for her health.<br>  <br>  There are simple and easy ways to prevent a baby from biting during nursing.  There are simple and easy techniques to make pumping comfortable.<br>  <br>  First you say you "want to"  wean then you say you have to.<br>  <br>  If you just said "I am weaning my 6 month old to formula" people would not argue with you or "attack you" because it was clear you had made a decision.

But I had those symptoms like you (which i didn;t normally have) and got a positive. So possibly, you might get a positive.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	for me early pregnancy signs were exactly the same as pre-menstral symptoms, though exaggerated slightly...and sore boobs...i never have them when due on.|`|VeuJB4lEaa	i had tirdness, metalic taste in mouth and sore bb's, i only got ill well after finding out though, i have a 2 yr old and about 5 weeks pregnant|`|3d016ddcde119d0d8bfdf37989c95744aa	I was tired all the time with soar breast, take a pregnancy test, I took a test when I was 3 days late , good luck!!
ouKBUj0Kaa	I have to agree with you: I'd be confused as well. <br>  <br>  I would go to the hospital. Your condition is getting worse, and your doctor made it clear that she wanted you to be checked. When you get there, if there is really no other way to see anyone else, explain to the last doctor you talked to that cough drops are not working, it's getting worse, you are feeling like hell and are worried about your baby. Make it clear that YOUR doctor made that decision that you had to get checked. She HAS to check you.<br>  <br>  Don't spend the weekend worrying because you are scared of hurting this new doctor's feelings or "disobeying" her. It's not better to spend the weekend worrying and stressing out. And if it turns out to be nothing, well at least you'll have some peace of mind and you'll probably never see her again. <br>  <br>  Your baby and yourself are the most important things right now. <br>  <br>  I hope you get better, take care! :)|`|VS8mactUaa	on call doctors are tired from having to deal with everyone over the weekend, which means she may just want to say that, if YOUR doctor told you to be seen right away, and teh doctor over teh phone is being difficult, go to the er and explain your situation and make i clear your not leaving til you see a doctor, that could be very dangerous, go to the er and stress to see a  doctor.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Is there absolutely no way to get a hold of your doctor?  If not then call the on call doctor again & re-explain the details.  Chances are, as nasty as this sounds, the on call doc just doesn't wanna have to go in and deal with you.  Ask the on call doc to call your doc at least.  If that doc still does not budge.  Go to an after hours clinic or the emergency room.  Then FIRST thing monday morning call your doc, explain everything & get in right away.  This is something that could effect your baby, if your doctor was concerned then you need to be too.  Good Luck!!!|`|FoDimTxCaa	I would go with my instincts and ignore the doctor you just spoke to!! Go yo your local A&E dept., explain that you have phoned your on-call doc and what she said to you but that you are in a lot of pain and very worried. Insist on being seen and checked over - you can always ask to see another doc while you are at the hospital. Good luck :-)|`|fiUF4cAXaa	I would go to the ER. You might have broncitis or pneumonia since it hurts to breathe. When i had the same symptoms, I wound up having broncitis.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Find an after-hours clinic in your area and go there.  It's faster and cheaper than the emergency room.  They have them in most big cities.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	If I were you I would call back and ask someone to page your doctor.  I hope everything is okay with you and the baby!

Yvy0V2ZJaa	The best you can do is wait for your blood test. If it says you are in fact pregnant, I really wouldn't worry about the HCG level. Many times you may just not produce enough. This doesn't mean that you wont be able to carry. There are several things involved with pregnancy to help in "stick". HCG is just a hormone. Try to relax, the bloating and nausea are a good sign of pregnancy and from the sound of it that's what you want most. I was very bloated at the beginning of this pregnancy and my lines on my home tests were barely there. I'm now 36 weeks pregnant due in March.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|yUyx2nhmaa	i think if you have nausea you are unlikely to have miscarried....a miscarried foetus wouldn't be causing nausea as it wouldn't be growing and taking things from you. i also think ectopic pregnancy would give exactly the same levels if hgc hormone as a regular pregnancy in the early stages. it sounds like u are building up to your period to me. good luck anyway and hope u feel well soon!
G2auAv1Saa	Make sure you, and everyone around you, speaks to her like she is a big kid and not a baby. That is one of the biggest things in a child learning to speak correctly. Practice words that she usually pronounces wrong. She may have a medical problem that in inhibiting her speech, if it persists go see her pediatrician and ask for a referral to a speech doctor.   I would be concerned with her not wanting to play by herself. As you progress with your pregnancy, are in the hospital and are just home with a newborn she can't be under your feet all the time. Have alone time where each of you go to your rooms for 30 minutes a couple times a day.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	One good book I liked, with activity ideas, was on "how to raise a smarter child by kindergarten"  my library had it, its by a David Perlmutter.  It also has info from newborn to age 5.  We've done things like making our own alphabet flashcards.  The thing my kids, will do the most on their own though is puzzles and playdough.  Anything like a worksheet, they need more direction on.|`|cAY3Z9wLaa	invite one or two of her friends round to your house or let her go to sum elses house, then play sum fun games  gd luck xx|`|MHg9JhEKaa	School at 3 yrs old?     I would take some advice from the school - perhaps they can suggest something that follows on from, or fits in with the things she does there. Some places even suggest not learning at home with parents, so as not to confuse the kids with different ways of learning.     Congrats and good luck with your pregnancy x|`|KA4dVajlaa	My daughter won't play any games on her own or sit by herself either she is actually just starting to watch tv a little she is know 4.  I did flash cards with her read her books I even got the books where you can trace the letters we made up songs with our ohone and address so she would remember it.  I bought a chalk board and we practice out letter and number and shapes on that and she LOVES that.  Hope this helps|`|2s5WSVbPaa	My son is 3 yrs old and doesn't speak due to autism, we have a sppech therapist who comes up with some fabulous games. She has told us to look on you tube and put in speech therapy there are 100's of different games and ideas to use. We have got alot of ideas from there, you could even key in autism speech therapy as the strategies will be the same. Hiding objects in a bag is a good start with 3 objects on table then put them in a cloth bag and she has to put her hand in and get an object and guess what it is before pulling it out. Best wishes.|`|w9ssFyitaa	there is a great website called preschooleducation.com it has activites for just about everything!
VR9KhbEgaa	I had mine changed because my doctor got called for jury duty....yeah! If your baby is already over 6 lbs I would encourage the doctor to move that date up!|`|YuqTcSSDaa	No, but if your baby is already 6 1/2 lbs, it would be for the better. As long as they take all proper measures, your baby can be born early w/ no problems. both of my boys were early. My first son was born at 37 weeks, came right home- no problems at ALL. My 2nd was born at 34 weeks and he was only in the NICU for 10 days.
rdpZrBc9aa	No.  The birth control pill is a hormone that makes chemical changes in her body so she won't become pregnant.  It's not perfect, but it's pretty good.  It takes a few weeks to work, and it must be taken at the same time every day or there is more chance of becoming pregnant. Also, it can really mess up her cycles if she stops taking it in the middle of a package.<br>  <br>  The only thing that works after having sex is the Plan B pill, and it must be taken with 72 hours of intercourse, so it's too late for that.  Either she is pregnant or she isn't.  Starting the birth control pill now could cause birth defects in the baby if she is pregnant.  <br>  <br>  If she hasn't missed a period, she is probably not pregnant.  If her period is late, she can test any day with her first morning urine.  If the test is negative, she'll need to test again a week later.<br>  <br>  Both of you need to keep your pants zipped until you know for sure if she's pregnant or not.  Then she needs to see the doctor for reliable birth control (there are other options besides the pill) or prenatal care.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10196172	There's a cycle of hormones that women go through every month. One hormone builds up to say "make an egg", the next one to release the egg about the middle of her cycle, and then the next hormone level to prepare for possible pregnancy. Then, if no pregnancy hormone shows up, the uterine lining sheds with all that blood and the cycle starts over.<br>  <br>  Birth control pills contain the hormone levels that say "we've already produced an egg, we're just waiting for pregnancy or a period". With no egg to implant, the uterus just stays like that until the end of the month. She stops the pills for a week (or takes the different-colored ones which are just sugar), has a period, then starts the pills again and again hops past the "make an egg" phase.<br>  <br>  So, they only work if she's been taking the pills regularly for that month. Most pills suggest the first month they're used, the ovaries may need to adapt to these different hormone levels; so they're not safe for preventing pregnancy the first month. <br>  <br>  So - the normal birth control pill can't protect her unless she's been taking it for at least a month.<br>  <br>  Plan B contains a extra-strong level of the hormones, which will force the uterus lining to shed (bring on a period) and prevent a fertilized egg from attaching. It's good for up to 72 hours after sex; the sooner the better. Do not use too often - messing with these hormone doses frequently  is not good.<br>  <br>  RU-486, or the "abortion pill" is good for a few months after pregnancy starts. It also contains a large dose of hormones which can cause the uterus to expell the placenta and embryo. You usually need a doctor to prescribe this, and I'm not sure if it's widely available in the USA.|`|tUIEWhsUaa	What birth control pill you are talking about? The common birth control pill that women use is the one you have to take daily for 21 days, then wait 1 week, which is the week the woman is supposed to get her period and then start another package again. The pill consists of hormones that prevent a women's eggs to come out basically so if she has unprotected sex the sperm wont meet up with egg inside the uterus(that's where the baby plants). And if you had unprotected sex and you are not planning to have a baby now, there is the PLAN B pill, or the "MORNING AFTER PILL", the woman is supposed to take within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. And I am sorry to tell but you are 5 weeks late. Did she get her period already?? Well I hope I answered your question.|`|0Of1i0Ruaa	No.  She needs to have been taking birth control pills for a certain length of time BEFORE having unprotected sex.  The pills prevent pregnancy if taken correctly, but cannot terminate one.<br>  <br>  There is the emergency contraceptive pill, but that only works up to 5 days after unprotected sex.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Birth control is : The contraceptive pill, Implant, Coil, Injection. The pill has to be taken for 21 consecutive days then you have a 7 day break in which you get a 'period'. If you had unprotected sex 5 weeks ago the next option for you is pregnancy test. You can only effectively protect against pregnancy if you take precautions before you act on it. The morning after pill is available up to 72 hours after but the longer it is left the less effective. Go get condoms and get your girlfriend to have an implant put in to be safe,...otherwise don't have sex.|`|627pWyVkaa	No birth control prevents pregnancy only if taken properly. meaning she would of had to been on birth control for at least a month before having unprotected sex for it to work. Taking if after having sex (ie. starting it) will do nothing but possibly harm the baby and make her sick. If shes pregnant the only thing she can do to stop pregnancy is nothing if your pregnant your pregnant. The only thing she can or could do is either keep it, give it up for adoption or terminate her pregnancy with an abortion. However she will have to speak too the proper people about this, as there not going to give you anything for her like abortion pill can be taken upto 8 weeks however that depends on when her last menstral period was. Anyways its best she takes a test, if shes not pregnant, and in the mean time wear a condom!
CV8KIpIxaa	trust me, i went through the same thing. i am in 8th grade right now.first of all, hes desperate for going from you to them within.. one day or so? thats horrible. First, dont get the boy involved till after. Invite both of your friends over and sit down and talk to them together. Say like you both are dating him. And at that point they will not want to be with him. Then they both can break up with him. Hope i helped! Good luck to you and your friends.|`|5i8rtlmXaa	all you have to do is get every body together at one time and the story will tell its self without you saying anything and becoming involved.and losing any Friends.|`|nYioXmnGaa	Take one of them and show them what he is doing it might get you less friends but hey  that stuff happens !! hope this helped !!!

Gojbv3Nraa	As low as three months for some, as high as six or seven months for others.<br>  <br>  You personally will likely notice it much sooner. Clothing fits a little differently, you feel a little tired, get sick with colds or flus, have days where you feel like you're "glowing" and pretty, other days where you feel like "ug" and not so pretty, hungry for different things sometimes..., new twinges and pains in pelvic region.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I showed at 14 weeks but needed bigger pants at 11 weeks.|`|Yvy0V2ZJaa	In the first 1-3 months women are completely drained. So tired they cant function with out day time cat naps. <br>  In the 3-6 month time some women begin to show there bellies. This is an exciting time as they are not so tired and have less morning sickness if they have had the chance to experience it. <br>  At 6-9 months Most women have a noticeable pregnant belly. This is also the time that they can start to feel the baby actually move. They may begin to feel tired again toward the end though. <br>  <br>  If you are looking for more signs that you are or are not pregnant you may want to ask that in a question, but if you know for sure that you are this should help.|`|G9UNW0NYaa	With my first, I was 24 weeks (7 months) before I looked pregnant.

This makes the name a terrible gender-bender and will dog the child for life. I'd have to say, please don't do it. If your heart is set on this odd name, at least stick it in the middle so the child can have a traditional name for legal stuff.<br>  <br>  However, you have another problem.

zdWDkadraa	I got pregnant on my first round of clomid. I also took the 100mg, and had sex everyday. The first thing I noticed was tender breasts, which aren't a normal symptom of my period, and I tested positive 2 days after my period was due. <br>  <br>  No one will be able to tell you if it will work or not...you just have to wait and see (which personally drove me crazy =) ) Don't be discouraged if it takes a few more rounds though!<br>  <br>  **Lots of baby dust to you**|`|642cfb0be92386461afffc7e71c12945aa	I was on clomid for 3 cycles and never conceived.  I started out on 50 mg and then on cycle 3 I was on 100mg.  On the last cycle I did not have any follicles. My fertility specialist said from the very beginning he would only do 3-4 rounds of clomid because if it would work it would do so in that length of time. He took me off after the third round because my ovaries were hyper stimulated and enlarged.   My symptoms were I gained weight, tender breasts, but my cycles were more regular and it seemed to help with spotting that I was having throughout the month. I was very moody, emotional and very depressed, that had to be the worst side effect.|`|lO3vrAPzaa	Clomid worked for me at 100mg. Unfortunately I had a m\c. But I'm willing to give it another shot :)  I had no symptoms didn't even think I could be pg so I didn't test for 4 weeks. The only thing I noticed was my boobs were extra sore...|`|Ka52nbhNaa	Clomid did not work for me - we tried it for 4 cycles, 3 of them were with Clomid and IUI.  My RE felt that if Clomid was going to work, it would happen within 3 cycles . . . after that it would be time to re-evaluate and move on.<br>  <br>  Good luck and loads of baby dust to you!
WSXDQ4bpaa	Pick up the book "What to expect when you're expecting" <br>  It helps out a lot with little questions or concerns you may have.<br>  Also rest and relax and don't take for granted any time you have with your boyfriend before the baby gets here =)|`|Shp5riE6aa	Don't eat raw hot dogs, shell fish or drink coffee.|`|9tMNpFmEaa	Don't panic.|`|b984345da5ffc81ac67daa3ecfff2effaa	Eat very healthy.  Understand everything you feed yourself you are feeding your baby.  That includes cigarettes and alcohol so don't do any of those things.  Get plenty of fresh air so baby has lots of good oxygen and take a safe amount of iron to allow that oxygen to travel through you well.  Don't look at being pregnant as a license to eat either because when it's all said and done you will have to work all that extra weight off.  Just be yourself but more cautious about what you eat and what type of activity you do.  Get rest also.  Don't be anxious.  Baby can pick up on this.

Hang in there.  You'll be back to sleeping normally in just a few short weeks.|`|bIE0PTY3aa	see if your doctor will approve a drug called doxylamine succinate. They are sold OTC in most states, but never take a whole pill, just half a pil, that's all you'll need, TRUST ME. Also ask him if you could add 1 ounce of red wine on top of that, see what he says. he may tell you to offset the wine with water during the day. And when you talk to him about the doxylamine succinate, mention that 'they guy from the internet" said to only take half a tablet. I just find it to be too strong otherwise, and it actually makes it harder to sleep. Also ask about XANAX XR, 2MG TABLETS, but I think he'll say no to those because they may effect the baby. -john in rock island, illinois, Quad Cities, USA<br>  <br>  I know that alot of people will scoff at the idea of the 1 ounce of red wine, but at 8 months, 1 ounce of wine will have a negligable effect, if at alll, on the baby.

AA10196172	If he had sperm on his fingers that went inside you, then it is possible.<br>  <br>  Sperm dies once it dries up and cools off. Or you can clean with acid or base, like soap, lemon juice or vinegar on a wet cloth; or water so hot you can barely stand it. Otherwise, it can take between a few minutes to half an hour, depending on the size of the glob and how warm and humid it is around it.<br>  <br>  Inside his plumbing or yours, sperm can last a while. The common fact is that sperm can wait in the uterus for the egg for 2 or 3 days, possibly up to 5. All the sperm has to do is get into your juices, then it swims to where it's going. In even a tiny drop of ejaculate there are millions of sperm, so the odds of one or 10 being lucky enough to make it are not that bad.<br>  <br>  The other problem is, you don't know when you ovulate for sure. The common wisdom is that it happens about 14 days before your next period, and the egg only waits about a day before giving up and dying. However, if it's late or early, which happens, that's not as obvious as your period being late or early - and to be safe, you would have to know about it 5 days ahead.  <br>  <br>  So yes, sometimes ovulation can be way off with no warning. Some women here will tell you that they got pregnant on or just before their period. Plus, it could happen up to 5 days after the main event.<br>  <br>  The only saving statistic - even if all the stars line up, and after a full deposit, only about 1 in 5 or 6 times does the woman get pregnant.(That's why there's the TTC discussions) It's like Russian Roulette; odds are it's safe, but it only takes one time. It gets riskier each time he pulls his trigger.<br>  <br>  The more you do this, the bigger the risk. If he's going to let go, make sure everything is cleaned up really well before he or you handle yourself. <br>  <br>  So, based on your timing and odds, I bet you're safe this time. However, there's always a chance that you're not. Wait and see; if you are late, then take a test. After about 2 weeks from now that should be accurate. Meanwhile, if you still have time (up to 72 hours), think about taking Plan B.<br>  <br>  If you said no and he did it anyway, then think about trading him in for a smarter model; at least make sure he understands how risky AND offensive that was.|`|YuqTcSSDaa	You cannot get pregnant unless his sperm is in you from his penis. If sperm touches the air, it dies. The ONLY way to get pregnant is if he comes inside you or pre come or it drips inside as he is pulling out.|`|tUIEWhsUaa	Most possibly you are not pregnant.

If he  had unprotected sex with you would you have used the same excuse (it wasn't me who wanted to do it?) Please be smarter. You are so young and you don't need to ruin your life by contracting STD's or becoming pregnant. <br>  Anyway, to answer your question you probably aren't pregnant. But obviously if your period doesn't come then you'll have to take a test & see.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you said No and he still tries to do it, you get the heck away from him. If he continues to try and molest you, you call the police. <br>  Sounds like a real winner of a b/f you have there....if he was a good guy he would have been more respectful.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	You probably wont be, but go get pregnancy tested.

Get her to take a test to put both of your minds at ease.|`|WSXDQ4bpaa	She could be. I tested when I was 4 days late and sure enough I was pregnant. But I did not have any symptoms until I was 5 weeks pregnant and it was only sore breasts and a bit of crying for no reason, at 6 weeks I was nauseous and developed morning sickness and did not get a larger appetite until I was about 14 weeks. <br>  <br>  Ask her to do a test for sure. Tests can give false negatives but not false positives so if she takes a test and it is positive then she is, if it is negative wait a week and take another if she has still not gotten her period and if it is negative with still no period then, see a doctor for a blood test to be 100% sure.|`|L8SqgQCkaa	16?  your out of your mind. and beyond stupid to. child support payments will help you in figuring this out. am 45, so what the hell do I know, to a know it all 16 year old. how about growing up, before you do grown up things. maybe just maybe being scared will teach you a good lesson.|`|Yvy0V2ZJaa	Its probably just her nerves. I'm sure as long as you were safe everything is fine. Ask a friend or family member to buy her a pregnancy test to relieve stress for both of you.

E5CnUdhsaa	you should trace his family to meet there new family member. not for help. its not there fault there son is a moron. they may offer some help, so take it. if you recieve money from them be warned that they can sek a court order for some sort of visitation to see the child with or without you present. you are not working so are therefore entitled to income support or some other government related funds to help look after you and your baby. you will also get child benefit, and shild tax credits, working if you are working. that is alot of money, plenty people live like that. if your not happy get a waitressing job or another age appropriate job and concentrate on raising your child. ou are a single parent...do it instead of ways to get money from people that owe you nothing!! he owes you yes but theres nothing you can do about him not working|`|QGP930C6aa	if you can get hold of him then go for it<br>  <br>  sorry i got a bit confused with who you were talkin bout but i think i got the jist of it.<br>  <br>  p.s why dont you apply for some benefits to help you pay the bills.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Tell him that either he helps you out, or he's going to prison for statutory rape.<br>  If that's how the statutory rape laws work in your country.|`|1hciyvKdaa	You have to raise this child on your own as you know. go find more work, maybe at night you can babysit for someone to bring in more money. Im sorry this happend to you. Bothering his family will not get you money so just stop. I am guessing you have no family or do not get along with your family? Stop sleeping with men for now, take care of you and the baby. Men of that age only want sex, and nothing else. IN the US, he would go to prison, its illegal. You could turn him into the police, its called statutory rape, its not rape as in forced, it is that he took advatage of a kid, your a kid a minor at your age, and it more than likely is against the law. I would call and tell them a man of 29 got you pregnant, they will test his and the babies DNA possibly.|`|Y16olPxlaa	Ask your family for advice. They'll be way more helpful then strangers considering the situation.|`|PdW09cmOaa	Your issues is with the child's father not his family by involving them it will only all end badly.|`|QQE58qFQaa	yes his family should want to see there grandchild even if it was illegitimate....|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	In a word "no".|`|BlPJw4iAaa	Why were you so stupid to get into this situation in the 1st place? If your old enough to conceive a baby, you should be old enough to deal with the consequences. Now your in this 'corner' you need to ask for help from whoever you trust the most. I doubt it his turkish family would believe you as they are going to believe their son over a random they've never met before. They may even question the likely hood of him being the dad. I think you need to speak to a social worker 1st. Get in contact with your local council and ask for advice.|`|dq16ybzgaa	His family really have no financial obligation towards your child. I suspect trying to trace them won't be a great idea as you are likely to be treated with hostility. <br>  You have been very strong and managed to support yourself and your daughter, so you should feel proud. This man took advantage of you and has left you with the consequences. Obviously you don't want him to be able run off scot free. However, I would concentrate on seeking any help you can actually get. Even if you are working there are many benefits that you might not even know you can get like New Deal.<br>  Concentrate on the future like getting training. Then if you still feel you have to do something, search out this guy and try to get him to face up to his responsibilities.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/index.htm?cids=Google_PPC&cre=Employment" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/i...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Jobseekers/ProgrammesandServices/DG_173730" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/J...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Jobseekers/ProgrammesandServices/DG_173757" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/J...</a>|`|vc403uWPaa	On the one hand, Yes i think you should. Your obligation is to your baby and making ends meet, his obligation was to his wife and his family, which he obviously doesn't care anything about. But on the other hand, what makes you think he's going to give you more money? He obviously doesn't care about your or your baby, and you can't make him pay up! It may be a waste of time and space. <br>  <br>  Now i know single mothers in a similar situation to yours and they are making ends meet just fine. Is there any way you could get help finding a house from the council? If you can't afford your rent, then they should help rehouse you and your baby. It has a better chance of working that going and seeing this man. I don't think he should "get away with it" but this man obviously has no sense of morrals, so is it just revenge you're after? A shouting match? How is that going to help your baby?|`|H41u0B8Jaa	No you don't involve his family.  You unfortunately got lied to by this guy and had his baby but you are the one who will have to suffer the consequences since he is a deadbeat.  I think you are wasting a lot of time and energy going after him and/or his family for support.  I can understand you are upset and need financial assistance however I doubt you will get it from them.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I would be very wary of doing so - you don't know their family and you have no idea what they would feel about this.<br>  Sounds like they will not help you financially.  Your babies father cannot be brought to reason, and will not support his child.<br>  His poor wife is the one I feel sorry for, he has no respect for her, and you somehow feel you can get back at him by telling her about the affair.  Poor woman.<br>  <br>  By all means, write a letter to his family, but view invites with suspicion.  I know I will get thumbs down all the way, but, if I had a pound for every story of a woman who has had her children taken off her by the Turkish family of her husband, where women are viewed as sub standard, I would be a millionairess.
aJLx0nhNaa	Do you mean she has diarrhea?  This question is almost impossible to understand.  Consult a doctor.|`|6PhSENcXaa	Sorry there is 7 of us here and none of us understand your question.|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	Really can't understand what you are asking.   Babies go to the bathroom a LOT!    If she has diarrhea take her to the doctor otherwise get used to it.|`|0nWsfdd9aa	I 'm sorry, but I don't understand your question.
FnvUZ7tIaa	My daughter has a 2 yr. old that is completely trained. She always  took her to the bathroom when she had to go, and just let her see what the deal was and didn't force the issue. Then she bought a little potty chair and sat it opposite her when she went , she would pull down her daughter's "big girl pants" or pull ups and just let her sit on the chair and she occasionally went and they celebrated. Then she got some of her favorite stickers and put one in the bottom of the little chair and encouraged her to pee on the sticker. Worked like a charm. When you are potty training it does feel like you are training your self, you have to make many trips even when you do not have to go and they will learn from you, but you have to be consistent, you can not keep starting and giving up. You have to commit to the job and not quit and start and give up, it makes the child think it is an optional thing. Most children are about 3 yrs. old, especially boys , but as a mom you are the best one to know when they are ready, if they aren't you are just fighting a losing battle. So if you are getting results at the age of 2 you are doing good. If you are a working mom you may have to schedule a week off and stay with it because the day care center are not as consistent as you are or committed , they have too many to watch at once. You know the signs and grab the child and run when you see one, lol.|`|KvXtDs8paa	i also have a potty training two yr old. have you explained to her what a potty is and what its used for? you may try rewarding her when she goes, and at first you may need to ask her like every 20 minutes if she needs to go, before too long she will tell you herself. oh, and when my little girl uses the potty i do a funny potty dance with her, its completely silly but it works!
tQPvv0Glaa	Oops!  You should be able to get an accurate test 2 weeks after having sex.  If you get a negative in 2 weeks and still don't start your period, wait another week and test again.  Good luck!|`|FcHplZtQaa	It is impossible to get pregnant for 21 days after having a baby, so if I was you I'd stop worrying, any pregnancy test you take will show up pregnant because of the pregnancy hormones still in your body!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Yikes...I wouldn't want to be in your situation!! <br>  I got a positive pregnancy test 3 weeks after sex, so I would wait atleast that long.|`|sk46uigvaa	Blimey what a situation!, first off i want to say Why are you and your partner going out drinking only 3 weeks After the birth!?!?!?!??!?!?<br>  You should be staying at home as a family nurturing and caring for your little boy at this stage!.<br>  <br>  Well To answer your question yes you could become pregnant this early many women have, but chances are your not THANK GOD! i would get on the pill and concentrate on being good parents to your little miracle.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	My friend concieved after 6 weeks so i guess it is possible, but even if you concieved you wouldn't have symptoms yet.|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	If it was only last night you can take emergency contraception.....<br>  if you don't want to get pregnant then do that|`|A0NfgNEiaa	same thing happened to me and im 32 weeks pregnant with number 2 and my little girl is 9 months on the 25th. <br>  <br>  i had a period before i got pregnant and i just new that i was pregnant again i was in the middle of moving house and i didnt want to take a test until i had moved so the first nite in my new home i took a test and it was positive. to comfirm i took another 1 the next morning and it was positive   <br>  <br>  if u are pergnant again i no how ur gonna feel its really hard to think of having another baby so soon but u no wat i cant wait to have me little baby it will be so much fun for both of them when they are about 2 as they will play with each other. my midwife side it will be abit like having twins lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck and all the best|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	Why do you need to find out asap?<br>  <br>  If your pregnant with in 3-4 weeks you will know if your not same amount of time you can test.<br>  <br>  but you cant change the out come if you are or are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  treat your body like you are pregnant just in case! a tiny baby could be growing in you and you want to be safe for that baby.<br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  <br>  and after a baby the 1st year is the easiest time to get pregnant|`|YuqTcSSDaa	You really are not healed from the first pregnancy and you can have a really hard time if you are. You should have waited AT least 6 weeks. You might not even be getting periods after your son , so it could be hard to tell. You might have to go to the obgyn and get a blood test to test for Hcg hormone levels or get an ultrasound.|`|627pWyVkaa	youll have to wait about 3 weeks to test for pregnancy to get a more accurate result. If you do not want to have another baby right away, you might want to get Plan B "morning after pill". it can be taken upto 3 days after unprotected sex.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	After 3 kids, and a TON of research....  THE BEST TIME to get pregnant is with in the first 6weeks after you have a baby.  Your hormones and body are still used to the fact... I know of lots of people who have had the term "irish twins"  2 babies born in the same year!|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I would think that you might want to wait at least a week or two to get a true result. Yes, this has now happened to me TWICE, I have a 15 month old, a 4 month old and I am 11 weeks pregnant again! My last period was Dec. 2006!!!!!! I never took a HPT, I found out at my 8 weeks check-ups about my new pregnancies! This past time I went in and the test at the Dr's. office was negative and I was actually 4 weeks along at that point, I went back a month later for some issues and that's when they did a scan and saw i was 8 weeks and 4 days pregnant! So if you do test and get a negative you might want to wait another month and test again even if you do start what you think is your period! Happened to me!
145RUNQHaa	She's wanting to give it up on the way to school as She's aware now of her sense of self and possibly embarrassed about having the dummy in public.i would suggest keeping it just for bedtime for as long as she wants.she won't have it forever the day will come when she won't need it anymore.the more you force it the more her anxiety and the more she'll need her comfort.don't make a big deal out of it and don't worry a dummy at bedtime is fine.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	You can tell her that the little babies over in another country (wherever you want to say), really need some dummies and because she is such a big girl she should give hers to them. Say that the dummy fairy is going to come and get her dummies and put her dummies in a bag and let her put them outside hanging on a tree or something. Tell her that when the dummy fairy comes to get the dummies she leaves a present. So you need to buy her a toy or something she would really like. I don't know if this will help, but just try and make such a big deal of it so she gets really excited!<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|1jwbQaZTaa	let her scream! 3 is too old for a dummy. if you give in once she's screamed for long enough, she'll do it till she's 10. <br>  <br>  its time to take it from her, its not good for her to still need it to soothe. like you said she has other comforts<br>  <br>  and tell the neighbors to mind their own!|`|xubIaiZaaa	i would let her scream, she'll be over it in a week. Now she just thinkx if she screams loud enough she'll get what she wants|`|VhE4KWhOaa	Very true now she knows how to get it back. my daughter brought one of hers to me one day that had the tip like partly bitten off of it and said its broke and just gave it to me to throw away so i went and i cut all of the tips off of the ones i had simple as that. and after they were all "broke" she never wanted one again. but with my son it wasn't that easy so when his "broke" and he was screaming i gave him a sucker like the ones u get at a bank and he was just fine once he got that. forgot all about it lol.<br>  <br>  Just stick it out! throw it out the window of the car when she tells u that so she can see u did throw it away. tell her to watch i'm gonna throw it away ok and ur never gonna want it again right cuz ur a big girl? and she'll say yes cuz she's a big girl. she'll see u throw it away and you'll have no choice then she may scream for a little while but she'll get over it.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Try explaining that dummies are for babies and now she is a grown up girl and going to pre school that you have to give it to a little baby. Just take it away and explain that its gone, she won't cry forever. Explain to the neighbours what you are doing so they don't worry. Try taking your little girl on a trip out for the day to take her mind off her dummy and to reward her for being such a grown up girl.<br>  <br>  Maybe I was lucky but my kids never attached themselves to anything in particular, my son sucked his thumb at night till he was about 6 but then he stopped.

Ka52nbhNaa	Yes, it counts - just feeling nausea most definitely counts . . . and if it is anything like what I experienced, it does not need to be limited to the morning.  It can happen any point of the day and be triggered by anything from toothpaste to smells to anything!

LFtGP9baaa	give him teething tablets before you put him to bed. that is the only thing that is helping my 8 month old sleep at night. although its not always all night|`|6Vw5kgGgaa	Yea I say keep him awake as much as possble throughout the day, though of course he will still need naps, just try to get him on a sleeping schedule, also try Johnson &Johnson Nighttime Lavender baths before you all go to bed  it's calming.|`|fiUF4cAXaa	You might be putting your son to bed too early. Try keeping him up til like 10 pm and see if that works. Good Luck|`|4ILA5CDzaa	Hmm<br>  maybe try feeding to where he is full before he goes to sleep ..<br>  Instead of feeding him one jar of baby food or a bottle, try giving him small bites of your own dinner and food .. or two or three jars of baby food .<br>  Hope that helps<br>  Sorry about your unfortunate dilemma =[|`|PdW09cmOaa	I really feel for you it can be very hard when you are the main carer of a child. One it sounds like you need time out for yourself it works wonders sometimes.Ok I am a mother of 3 children what I found was routine is very important decide what suits you and your child best.Example dinner bath story cuddles and bed night routine should not go over the hour.When he wakes up try tucking him back in with a shhh then go back to bed.Wont be easy but hang in there.|`|XlltSqLHaa	Hi! That sounds awful, you poor thing! My suggestion is taking him to your doctor & explaining what's going on. There may be another reason why he's not sleeping!! Besides that, try Johnson's & Johnson's Lavender Bath & Lotion, that always worked for my kids!! And...rocking them to sleep, but that's kind of a bad habit to start, i would know!! LOL!! Good Luck & I hope you have sweet dreams soon!!!|`|hfHnjjmXaa	hi dear, first of all i really feel sorry for ur plight. however, believe me, this will be over... but let's tackle the problem now. U did not mention that u brought him to see a peadiatrician. is it possible to bring him to one to get assessed? perhaps he is down with colic. Tat cld be the cause of him not sleeping well.<br>  yeah, babies who are hooked on pacifier will wake up wanting it. <br>  Recently, i just weaned my 3yr old twins from their pacifiers. It wasn't as difficult as i tot. it took me two hours to do the job.<br>  dont worry about getting him off pacifier, now its the time to find ways to let him sleep. he is not having it good either for not being able to sleep for long. also, check that he is not wearing too little or too much. either way, he can't sleep well too, Ensure tat the room he sleeps in is well ventilated too. .<br>  by the way, i feel sorry for ur husband too. send my love n regards to him.|`|mnztkB6vaa	I have heard of places that you go with your baby for a few nights and the nurses try and work the problem out. They assist you and help get you a routine happening. i would contact your local mothers association if you are really struggling and ask them for support, thats what they are there for!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Oh mom how not fun for you. They go through stages, if you know hes full and you know hes dry and hes safe, go back to bed, put in ear plugs or whatver it takes and set your alarm for when you need to get up for him. It is so tough during these times, if hes not sick, he is getting to the age where he needs to be able to just voice his opionion of not being in your arms, but as a parent we have to teach them good routines and its not always easy to do. Babies do just cry for the sake of crying, You need to get out and make friends, because you are in desperate need of finding someone to take the baby for a few hours once in awhile for some quiet me time. Dads doing his part hes a hard worker and a good provider, and sometimes we dont get that needed help but those hours are killer so he too needs some down time. Both of you are needing some down time right?!<br>  I promise you its ok to let the baby cry, they get all worked up, look all puffy, and it makes us feel bad, but it doesnt hurt them, this isnt painful for them. Many lessons we teach our kids in life are not pleasant for them, but we still need to teach them. Since hes not hungry, change him if he needs it, a kiss on the forehead and walk away, just try it ok, he cant teach you, you must teach him. Hell be fine. If your able to get like 5 hours of sleep, can you imagine how much better you wll feel, and be able to be more cheerful.<br>  Try finding a baby and me class at a local community center, or adult education center. I went to one with my first daughter, and we sung and clapped babies hands to patticakes and the likes, it was great to meet new moms in my area, and eventually we all knew each other, wed go to lunch occassionally and one gal and I met at each others house once a week and chatted and took turns holding each others kids and bonding, she became a god send in my life, and I think I was there for her too. You need your sleep ok, get some. Running yourself down and you wind up getting sick from it, then where will you be?? Make a deal with hubby too, on sat and sun you each get 5 hours of freedom and not being dsiturbed for any reason, he will like the quiet time and you know you will too. Even if you have to go nap while reading at a library to get your rest, just do what it takes.|`|mNJFttV6aa	I feel for you!  Been there done that.  I lived through it and you will too.  Some children just don't seem to sleep very well while others sleep like a rock.  I had one of each.  My first was breastfed to 19 months, once I stopped nursing her sleep patterns changed...I'm not implying that you quit nursing so don't go there ok.  <br>  I found the warmer I kept her and the cooler the room was the better she slept.<br>  <br>  He's probably too big for a swing but that was my saving grace.  I would look at the foods that you are offering, they may be gassy or just not agree with his system.  Be careful about introducing foods... one at a time so you can see his reactions.  I made my own foods too from table scraps.  At night you may want to give him something that is a bit more "stick to your ribs"  like rice or a banana.<br>  <br>  I'm here for you, feel free to email me.|`|IOguFQMAaa	I would really look into a MOPs group in your area.  It stands for Mothers of Preschoolers which means if you have children 5 and younger you are in.  It is VERY supportive and informative.  A way to meet other moms and to get out with your little one and just plain socialize.  I don't know why your baby is not sleeping but someone does.  Maybe someone at the group.  Do a google search for MOPs.  Keep your chin up, say a prayer, call your family and have a good cry.  Parenting is the hardest thing you'll ever do but it is also the best.  Just know that you are not alone and that there are many moms feeling exactly the same way you are.  Also WHAT-TO-EXPECT.COM is very informative and lets you know what to expect from your baby as they reach difficult milestones.  Hopes this helps!  Hang in there and any time he naps you try and nap too.  Sincerely, Susie|`|RdprMxoUaa	My son has a dummy and he did this too. This is the reason I did not want to give him a dummy originally but he started teething early so I had to let him chew on something at night. And of course he would spit it out and not be able to find it so I (like you) had to keep getting up to find it for him. I did try using a clip on strap to keep his dummy near him. It worked great for a while as he could feel for the strap and find the dummy on the end. If you're wondering about strangulation risk, I clipped it on low enough so there was no way it would get around his neck. As I said it worked for a while but in the end the only thing that has really worked is him naturally getting more mobile and being able to find the dummy for himself. Since then he has slept 10 hours per night. I feel your pain as you feel like a zombie when your sleep is broken like this. I hope this helps.<br>  Oh and btw keeping your bub up more during the day will not make him sleep more at night. The more sleep babies get the more they want not the other way round. Been there done that!|`|hieQHR0daa	It's tough. You really need help and someone to share this with you. How soon after a feed is he waking? has he always done this?<br>  If the answer to the first question is within one hour of settling and if he has always done this he has, quite possibly got reflux. It's not always spitting up it can be "silent." Children who have this problem cannot settle because they are very uncomfortable. If he has reflux he should be on medication like cisipride or gaviscon and if he was put to sleep with his upper body raised slightly that would also help. It sounds as if he has got his own sleep deficit problems too which are making it more difficult for him to settle.<br>  Try and get him to sleep with out the pacifier. He may well  be waking to find it and it does encourage the swallowing of wind to some extent.<br>  It's good that you have a sleep routine but he obviously has to quite learned to self sooth when he wakes between sleep cycles and needs you to get him back to sleep.<br>  You need to think about whether you would like to use a gradual or an immediate cold turkey type program to get him out of these bad habits.<br>  A tailored program would suit you best of all but you need to identify a professional in your local area who can help you further.|`|xGI9z01Maa	You might try to feed him just before bed.  It might help him sleep longer.  But if he is waking up every 45 mins then you need to take him to the doctor office, he might be having breathing/sleeping issue himself.  <br>  <br>  Also, either get a family or friend to come and watch him for a weekend or hire some one.  You have to get a good night sleep at some point.  You are not helping yourself or others including your son if you can't think straight.  <br>  <br>  Wish I could be more helpful but I was lucky.  My children all sleep through the night early on.  But I don't think that this is normal for a baby to only sleep 45 mins at a time at his age.

dpPqH7BAaa	I'm 39 weeks + 5 days, and I have been having the same symptoms you have. I don't even feel my BH contractions. The only reason I know I'm having them is if I put my hand on my stomach and feel from the outside. A lot of women don't feel their contractions until they are mostly dilated. Oh, btw. The reason Caster Oil works sometimes for inducing labor is because it gives you horrible diarrhea and causes everything down there to go into spasms. So this is just a guess, if you have loose stools, and you are having pain or cramping while it's happening, you may be having contractions without knowing it. If I had to guess you are probably going to make it to your induction date if this is your first baby, mainly because you want it so bad, that it's going to take longer just to spite you. That's how I feel with my pregnancy anyways LOL. Good luck, try walking UP HILL for about a mile after you use the restroom, that gives me mild BH contractions.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	my 1st signs of labour are always an upset tummy ( both ends for me !! )<br>  just coz u have no cramps now doesnt mean they wont start later!<br>  good luck look out for dull pains x x x x<br>  fingers crossed u wont make it to tuesday x|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	I'm not sure if the diarrhea is a definate sign of labour.

h3Xbi8fVaa	If any employee came to me and said they were felt uncomfortable with someone else in the workplace I would encourage them first of all to talk to this person directly and try to fix it between them informally.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work then I would suggest they either a) more forceful and told the individual they don't appreciate how they are being treated and if it continues they will have to inform their boss and make this situation more formal or b) just skip a) and make a direct formal complaint about this individual directly to myself or another one of their line managers at which point I would begin a disciplinary investigation.<br>  <br>  I manage about 30 people in my job and there are many conflicts. I think that in a work place with a lot of staff working in a close environment, problems and conflicts and clashing of personalities are inevitable.

Everyone and every pregnancy is different they say.<br>  <br>  Congrats on not feeling sick!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	yes|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Congrats!! get down on your knees and thank god if those are the only symptoms you get =)|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Yes its normal...<br>  Everyones symptoms vary with every different pregnancy.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Yes, everyone is different :P|`|nYioXmnGaa	YES it is !!! nothing to worry about !
nSaC9UzGaa	Could be a miscarry, but there's usually more bleeding, oh, and pain.<br>  <br>  If you're concerned go to a GP. They can physically help you, while people here can only make you worry more.<br>  <br>  Hope it's all good though. :)
7rCeCVl2aa	It's a scam. Your baby can NOT read. Your baby is recognizes words off of memory. If you really want your bay to "read" then buy large white note cards and write words in black on them. That is what the your baby can read program is.<br>  <br>  Read to your baby daily and teach them phonemic awareness and they will read just fine.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Looks like a scam to me.|`|gs8MSMs3aa	NO GOOD!<br>  <br>  your baby will learn how to read in due time, this is too much for them believe me!<br>  i have studied child psychology and over stimulating a child at that age has showed some links to autism<br>  <br>  i dont suggest it, right now all you should do is read books to the baby, and make reading a huge part of their lives with you.  let them see you reading and read to them.  read them everything<br>  <br>  that is the real way to make you child learn to read, not some your baby can read program<br>  <br>  hope that answers your wuestion!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	When I first saw that infomercial I thought "I need that for my daughter, I want her to be smart!"....who am I kidding? I'll allow my daughter to learn at her own pace. I'll read to her, sing to her, play with her, and teach her new things when she's ready. I don't see any reason to plop her down in front of a TV screen to "teach" her how to read by the time she's one. It's a waste of money, if you ask me. Be a hands on parent - your kid will do just fine without some expensive waste of money.
KWPnoqGMaa	if you had your period in november and didnt get it in december there is a chance you  can be pregnant. In some early pregnacies they say you can still get your "period" but it will be very light and it wont last no more then for like 2 -3 days and it will be nothing like your regular period...meaning no heavy bleeding..not all pregnacy test are pricey. family dollar has them for $4 they all work some is just higher in price then the others..i would go again and take a pregnacy test or go to the doctor and tell them you want to take a pregnacy test...then you wont have to spend money!! :) good luck..<br>  <br>  5 weeks pregnant first child.. ;)|`|PymVygFraa	Hey, in my opinion, I guess I think it's better to be safe rather than sorry?<br>  Also lol, tell your boyfriend/husband/guy-you-did-it-with to buy it :P<br>  Haha.<br>  Goodluck!<br>  xx|`|nYioXmnGaa	Yes I would but that is just me .|`|VS8mactUaa	Well test only cost like 15 to 20 dollars, thats not expensive, there is no way else to tell without a test, unless you wait 5 months or so to see if your belly gets hard :)|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	nahhh, just wait 9 months and see if something pops out =).... saves money that way, dont have to buy the pregnancy test
CIBtfxEqaa	CONGRATULATIONS! It will probably not sink in for a few more days, but enjoy it! You are doing great by going ahead and getting prenatal vitamins. Call your dr.'s office ASAP, they will probably want to do a blood test just to confirm it, but if you took 3 tests and got all +++, then you are most definitely pregnant! The first visit they will likely do an internal check and they might check for a heartbeat. If you don't hear one, DO NOT FREAK OUT, the baby just might not be big enough to hear it yet. I don't know how every other doctor does, but my doctor did an internal ultrasound on my second visit, and we heard the heartbeat and saw our bean for the first time. It is really a great experience! Don't be overwhelmed. Go get the book "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and it will help you a lot! Good luck!|`|lBKKPZFeaa	When you go to the doctor, if you have a good prescription plan see if you can get a prescription for prenatal vitamins.  I am TTC and my gyno gave me a prescription for prenatals and it ended up being way cheaper to get them that way than it is to buy them over the counter.  Just a suggestion!|`|wQBneD85aa	congratulations|`|VS8mactUaa	Folic acid is one of the most important things you need right now, make sure you get at least. 0.4 mg everyday, if you want to wait to see a doctor before hand, eat lots of green leafy vegetables, they contain folic acid.<br>  <br>  It will help to protect against abnormalities, like spineobifida, or however you spell it.|`|COZJaXY9aa	Congratulations!! There is no words to describe the feeling you have when you see that bfp! Just make sure to take your prenatal vitamins everyday, drink lots of water, light exercise, and rest when your tired. Dont worry about it not sinking in yet...Im 14 weeks have heard the heart beat and seen the ultrasound and it still hasnt really sunk in yet!! :) Dont obsess on what you can and cant eat, I did and my dr basically told me to eat what I want. People will tell you all these crazy things you can and cant do but really just use your common sense and youll be fine! Congrats again!|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Congrats! That is so great! I would pick up What to expect when your expecting....it has all the do's and don'ts in it.<br>  <br>  Don't...<br>  eat sushi<br>  take hot baths<br>  drink more than 1 cup of caffiene a day<br>  take any medicine besides Tylenol (but do not stop a prescription drug with out calling your doctor!)<br>  eat to much sugar<br>  eat lunch meat or cold cuts<br>  drink alcohol<br>  smoke<br>  do drugs<br>  ect....<br>  <br>  Do<br>  take your prenatal<br>  get sleep<br>  stay hydrated<br>  celebrate!<br>  <br>  WISHING YOU A HAPPY AND HEALTHY PREGNANCY! <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|0Qiscnkeaa	Crissy!!!! Congrats!!! I would recommend going to Wal-Mart or a pharmacy and buying prenatals over the counter. They don't cost that much and you may be able to stay on just those throughout. Unless you are a weird one like me and have to take them while TTC too and a certain kind!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!! And loads of sticky dust to you!!!|`|oHNrktxTaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  I am truly happy for you. <br>  <br>  Praying for you to have a safe full term pregnancy!<br>  <br>  Thank you! My husband & I have been trying to conceive now for the past few months. Keep sending the BABY DUST!!!!!!|`|3lV7ZY3raa	first of all CONGRATSS!!! and thanks for the baby dust! get all your prenatal vitamins and stuff, elevit is the best to use in my opinion. and just lay back and spoil yourself until the bub comes along!!
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	We have a minivan... err a dodge caravan?  I think?????    We had a neon but couldn't fit two carseats, two adults, and a medium sized dog in it.    The gas mileage is about the same for all minivans.  We were thinking of keeping the neon because the additional insurance costs would have almost been the same as the gas savings for my husband's communte.  But then the neon died and it surely wasn't worth $5,000 to fix it =))    If you are thinking of buying used this site has the mileage on used cars so you can compare:  http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/sbs.htm|`|zwctZ812aa	I have one child and I drive a Honda Accord.  I like the car, it's great on gas mileage, but I hate that the stroller takes up most of the trunk space, and I will admit that I have hit my son's head on the roof of the car a couple times trying to get him in and out.  Never hard, but I feel so bad!!! My boyfriend is getting me an Acura MDX for my birthday in May :-) We have been saving because I want very badly! He drives a Ford F-150.|`|rAkWoweOaa	We have two one ton Chevrolet duallys. They are diesel fuel, and will absolutely EAT the fuel, so I bought a new Mitsubishi eclipse and it gets 38 mpg. I have only 1 baby, I cant imagine fitting more than 2 kids in that car. My husband wont even get in it with the carseat behind his seat. He is too tall.|`|remZ5gDUaa	We have 3 kids and 2 vehicles. A dodge stratus which I drive everywhere. I take and pick up my daughters from school and pretty much every where I need to go and I only put gas in like 1 time every 3 weeks! And its ok on the room since I only have 1 in a car seat. I have a 3 month old and the 8 and 9 year olds don't have car seats anymore. My husband drives a dodge ram which is ok on gas especially with it being a truck. I'm hoping to trade the stratus in for a dodge journey soon!  Those things have room to spare!|`|HF97Rs9qaa	I have one child due very soon. I drive a Subaru Legacy L wagon. I love it because it has AWD for the winter, has a lot of cargo space and gets great gas mielage. About 25 in city and about 30 HWY.  It also has a roof rack for putting on bins, cargo boxes, bike racks etc.    I also never have any problems with it, it is a great car.    I also have a Recaro and it fits just fine!!!    I love my car but next I may want a Honda CRV, an older model because I like the look of the slightly older ones better.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I have one child but I drive a Trailblazer. Those car seats are just so big for little cars. It gets about 17 miles to the gallon in town and about 21 on the highway, so it's not bad. A bigger vehicle is a must even if you have just one kid!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	We have two cars, a 2003 Pontiac Vibe and a 2002 Ford Focus.  Both are good on gas mileage and still run great!    We have one 10 month old.|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	We have 2 kids one is six and the other three months we have a truck which only my hubby drives now and a PT Cruiser that is way too small  I can barley fit a stroller in the trunk and my husband kisses the dashboard if he is not driving we are going to get a van soon it gets good gas mileage but not a family car|`|O0D9GtElaa	I have two and one of them (girl) does dance four times a week and i have to drive her to schoole every morning.  My boy does wrestling every day.  So as you can see just for my kids i do a fair share of driving.  Plus me going to work three times a week.  And other daily errands.  You won't believe how lond i can go without gas on my car.  Two weeks!!!!  It is the Honda Pilot.  I have the 2006 model but I love it.  I have seen the new one and driven it and i like that one a lot too!  It is the best.  My husband is a lemon lawyer (law dealing with cars) so he knows a lot about cars and he picked this one out for me.  So i know it is a great car.  Good Luck!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	A Focus and a Mustang. Not bad on gas but both are equally horrible for even just one carseat. We will definitely be upgrading when we have another baby!|`|CE3bmj65aa	I only have one right now, but I do plan on having more soon.  We have a 2006 Ford F150 that is four doors and it is spacey and can hold three carseats across the back.  But it is bad on gas, it gets maybe 13mpg.  We also have a Pontiac Grand Am and it too is four doors, but it can only fit two carseats in the back.  It is great on gas though, I think it gets around 28mpg.  I plan on getting a Ford Escape Hybrid after I go back to work.  They have lots of room for carseats and also cargo space for strollers of what not.  And the fact that it is a hybrid you get the space of a SUV, but the gas mileage of a car.|`|8cDd70dSaa	My mom has 3 kids (more like 2 now that I'm at college), and she drives a Honda Odyssey. She loves it to bits. She kind of drives it like it's a sports car :), but it gets good gas mileage and it's like a dream compared to the Dodge Caravan she was driving before.|`|toOzi7aLaa	I have a mitsubishi eclipse. Its a racing car i had before baby number 1 and its hell now. I get about 22 mpg but the car is not child friendly i hate it!    I am hoping for a Nissian Quest but i doubt that will happen|`|UghJ0XROaa	we have a dodge caravan and a two door chevrolet cavalier, we use the van for generally everything, but i take it to and from work and my husband take the cavalier. He always complain about the cavalier and getting the girls in with only two doors. (i answered your other question there, we have 2 girls.)    oh and the cavalier gets excellent gas mileage and the van only gets usually between 16-19 mpg|`|HqOkC2YHaa	We own 2 cars, my car is a 2 dr sunfire best car on gas mileage, but worst on getting Amber in and out of the car now that she isn't in an infant car seat anymore and still has to be rear facing, I can fit in 2 full size car seats in the back but good luck getting a third or squeezing in a adult in the left over seat. But what can I say I bought the car at 16 and have had it for 8 years so it's been pretty good for me!    Our other car is a Malibu, great family car! Pretty good on gas as well and big enough to have 3 full size car seats in the back seat (when I go out with my friend and her kids I always drive) It's not very stylish I feel like it's a grandmas car, but I guess it's better then a buick!|`|nBlSS6HUaa	We have a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. And well.. DON'T GET ONE!! lol right now I have my daughters car seat in there which is a Graco Nautlist (and we LOVE IT) but...there's no room in the back seat or front! I mean...she's only 22 months old and if she extends her legs she touches the seat in front of her. And the person in the front is eating the dashboard! LOL   But we are waiting to see if I'm pregnant now...because if so...we need to find a van or something else. Because I can't fit 2 carseats in the backseat of the jeep, because my husband and I are both kind long legged and need the seats back.|`|OxFV92hJaa	2006 Toyota Corolla. Nearly 30 MPG in town, 35+MPG on the interstate. Less than $20 a fill up, under $100/mo total gas!!     We have 3 kids, all in carseats. (4yrs, 1yr, and a 2 month old.)    Prior to that we had a brand spankin new Ford Escape, gas guzzler!!!! Hated that SUV, had nothing but problems with it. Only had 1 lil one then. Traded it in for the Corolla when I was pregnant with  2.|`|zQQkRR6paa	I drive a 2 door convertible sunfire. NOT a baby friendly car. I love my little car, and its been paid off for a couple of years. So it will be hard to give up, but I will be car shopping next month.  Its like a comedy act trying to get my daughter in and out of that thing. We just made our last payment on my husbands car so its time for a new one for me.    Ive been looking at the Subaru Outback. Its seems get good safety ratings and has plenty of room for baby, groceries, strollers...etc. I also have two dogs so I like the idea of them being separated from the baby.    Im interested to hear what cars work for others since Im getting ready to buy one myself!|`|afc692e37eb08c220509639ca2e1a9f5aa	Well i drive a BMW x5 and my fiance drive a lincoln Navigator. This is my third pregnancy. We really don't want to trade in our cars so its going to be an issue with the car seats but we found a way to work this out.Since the Lincoln has more room in it for the car seats that's the car that i will be using now:). The gas mileage isn't that great. I know that we should have gotten cars with better mileage but we only live once right.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	We have four and a  97 Honda Accord (good on gas) and a 01 Ford Explorer (ok on gas) with the extra seat, and an 83 Suburban (sucks on gas) for when we need to take all the kids and there friends, We also have a log truck but you cant really get kids in that.|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	We have a 04 Altima 3.5, ok on gas, the 2.5 is better, plenty of room and we have a '04 Pathfinder, not good on gas, but we also have 2 big dogs so we need the room.  I thought I was the only one who hit thier kids head on the car getting in and out, i felt so bad!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I have a Pontiac Sunfire coupe and 1 child.  It is a big pain getting my son in the back and out again...but I bought the car before we got pregnant so we have to stick with it for a few more years.  The gas mileage on it is pretty good.  It's about $40 cdn to fill the tank and that lasts us almost a month.  My next car or truck will have command start though...and 4 doors! :)|`|pXSKSS3daa	We have two vehicles. My main one is a Pontiac G6 and it does pretty well on gas mileage. My husband's main one is a Chevy Equinox and it does crappy on gas mileage... lol. We just have our son for now but both vehicles will do well when we have more babies.    If we're going out of town we drive the Equinox, otherwise we've been trying to drive the car more.|`|AykczQleaa	One boy.  Three vehicles.

I ended up getting a Saturn Vue. I get decent gas mileage and it can fit two car seats comfortably (which is good my cousin often rides with me and she is due 6 weeks after me) and tons of storage left in the back.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I have a Pontiac Bonneville with three car seats in the back. It's a tight fit. But was fine when it was just my two oldest. I get okay gas mileage, about 20 mpg. I plan on getting a jeep in the next couple of weeks though. I can't wait!|`|Nti8czLvaa	I drive a 2004 Honda Pilot.  I have two kids, but have my niece during the day so for the most part I am toting three kids around.  I think there is plenty of room, we have two high back boosters and a convertible all in the same row. And we did at one point have two convertibles and a infant carrier all it in the same row. So I would say they are very spacious. It does not get the best of gas mileage, but its an SUV, but I love it!!
cnIzqEoDaa	My sister actually had negative blood and urine tests until she was a few months pregnant. They couldn't explain why she kept having negative tests. So, there is a possibility... although I'm not sure how common it might be.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Blood tests are not wrong, you are not pregnant. Your body is playing tricks on you.

NpomCCjUaa	My baby arrived 10 days early. My waters ruptured and were leaking very slowly, so the doctor decided I'd need to be induced. He is my first baby and I had read that first babies often arrive late. I was therefore very surprised when it all happened so early.

Even all of my 4 ultrasounds were saying that my due date was around the 16th....he just wanted to come early!  Went into early (slow labor) on Friday the 5th and the dr kept giving me Morphine shots for pain and sending me back home until Monday morning then they told me to start pushing Monday night....then ended up having an emergency C section.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	my son was born on my due date|`|GS9Bz0pAaa	I ended up watching my due date come and go :( ..

Right now, we're going to wait a year or so and then re-think when we're going to start trying. It's very important to us that we bring our children into the best situation possible and for us, that means waiting for now. But more than likely, we'll probably start trying in my early 20s.|`|oTlqbdAlaa	I have three kids, two girls and a boy. We might try for another in the next year but that is still just an option.|`|tht0DrHsaa	I have three kids.  Two boys and a girl.  That is all the kids I plan to have.

VII5wup3aa	Like you me and my boyfriend/ future husband have been talking about baby names, not that I'm pregnant or planning on it, but we like to talk about them. He's also Italian so we have a lot of names like that. <br>  Alexa Jeannie- I like this. I actually think Jeannie Madelyn would be cute if you used it as a first name instead, but Alexa Jeannie is cute.<br>  Bianca Madelyn- Bianca Madelyn is cute too, and even though I'm not a fan of the first and middle being the same letter Bianca Brooke would be adorable.<br>  Cara Brooke- I love the name Cara.<br>  Gianna Claire- I actually think Gianna Kate and Natalie Claire would be cuter but I also love them like this. <br>  Natalie Kate<br>  <br>  Dominic Ryan- This sounds really good.<br>  Ethan James- Again I think Ethan Tyler and Gavin James would be cute, but I like them like this too.<br>  Gavin Tyler<br>  Hunter Joseph-My boyfriend's middle name is Joseph so this is also on our list. His name is Daniel Joseph which I think is beautiful... Hunter sounds great also.<br>  Nolan Matthew- This is beautiful too. It sounds old fashioned, but in a good way. Like a Civil War gentleman : )<br>  <br>  Altogether you have great names but first and middle I love them all but you also have great names that you could mix and match and they would sound just as good if not better.<br>  <br>  My favorite girl names are: Bianca Madelyn, Gianna Claire and Natalie Kate.. but I also would suggest Jeannie Madelyn, Natalie Claire and Gianna Kate.<br>  My favorite boy names are: Well I actually like all of the boy names, I can't pick a favorite but I would suggest....Ethan Tyler and Gavin James...also like I said I think with Joseph a name that starts with a D sounds good...so Dominic Joseph or something along those lines would be cute too : )<br>  <br>  <3 Hope that helps|`|fiUF4cAXaa	I like Alexa Jeannie, Bianca Madelyn, Natalie Kate (I like Natalia better), Dominic Ryan, Nolan Matthew, Ethan James|`|VnUIZIL1aa	natalie<br>  cara<br>  nolan<br>  dominic<br>  hunter is ugly dnt pik it<br>  good luck on the kid|`|HlmbwfOhaa	gabrielle or gabriella marie<br>  alexandra rae<br>  charlotte ann<br>  austin james<br>  i love gianna but dont like bianca at all!!!!! no affence :)<br>  maxwell steele<br>  mary margo<br>  giavanni lee<br>  anastasia <br>  julia rose<br>  cheyanne<br>  lilliana shea<br>  rosalie may<br>  lindsey may<br>  carter <br>  candy<br>  amanda<br>  racheal<br>  labella or labelle<br>  bella<br>  rose<br>  kirsten<br>  maybelle<br>  kandren<br>  kendra<br>  bridget<br>  thomas<br>  william andrew<br>  christian<br>  chester<br>  chanie<br>  shelby adelaide<br>  zane<br>  zeak<br>  brooke<br>  zoey<br>  brandon<br>  jacob<br>  jake|`|EdLeOUBfaa	I absolutely love Gianna Claire.

ki5hZbcTaa	A Britax marathon or a TrueFit by The First Years are the best! The 2nd seat is only 180 dollars! <br>  <br>  Just remember: she has to be kept rearfacing until she is 1 year AND 20 pounds. She has to meet both requirements before you turn her, although it is now reccommended to keep them rearfacing to the limits of the seat. Both of those seats will rearface to 35 pounds.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	We have two Britax car seats and love them.  I feel like the kids are so much safer.  They are built like a tank.  They are bigger than most seats so you have to take that into account when looking at which model to purchase and the size of your car.|`|ROEBagSraa	I have a britax plus and i love it it reclines in three positions great seat me and my two friends think there A+
XRbHcGuLaa	People, I think she means for a keepsake... Geeze.  I'd go to Tiffany's and have something done custom from their silver collection -- maybe collect charms for each month and make it into a bracelet she can wear when she's older.  It won't be too expensive either and it is classic.  I don't know any websites that sell specifically baby jewelry though; many jewelry stores have a small section for children.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	There is no safe jewelry for babies other than earrings. If they can reach it they can eat it.|`|suVispAAaa	Like some one else said there is NO safe jewlery for babies. If they can reach it they will chew it & could easily choke (especially as they get older & start to wander & investigate more & when they start teething)! The only thing is stud earrings for pierced ears, but they should even be supervised when wearing those, because babies like to investigate & they could easily pull on there ears & pull out the stud earrings & choke.
SaRDq9iLaa	Gatorade bottle, tv remote and my cordless phone|`|n6XYYyoLaa	exact same as yours, LOL; i have gotten an old cellphone out bc the toy one didn't look real enough i guess...i only let her play with it when i am closely supervising, but she thinks she has got the real thing!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The string on my hooded sweatshirt.

It's the only thing he'll fuss over if I take it away.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	The remote, margarine tubs, empty boxes, empty formula canisters, stainless steel pots and pans, cordless telephone, my keys, my bus pass, my purse straps, my bra, daddy's underwear...I think I got it all LOL|`|1hciyvKdaa	My first daughter loved a cupie doll that was still in the packaging and made all that crinkley noise as she held and squeezed it, we never took it out of the package!!|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Well of course my cell phone as well lol...but she LOVES and I mean LOVES water bottles! haha.....She gets so excited! haha|`|14JQ11AUaa	My boy is like the same!

It couldn't have come at more perfect timing.. About a week before he turned two, their vacuum cleaner broke, so they got a new one and slapped a bow on it for him and he loved it! Almost a little too much...randomly one night, he managed to get into the closet, undo the outlet cover, and started vacuuming at about 3 am. Needless to say, they had to put a lock on the closet and have vacuum time rules.|`|gdlc9Jg4aa	My 3 year old son has been in LOVE with my hairbrush for about a month.

FASzVGrraa	just relax and don't stress! just wanted to say good luck and baby dust! remember sperm can live for 2-3 days inside you so you have a chance! <br>  (:
39qec43kaa	At four months doctors tell you to start with infant cereal to get their stomachs used to it so they will not have to drink formula or breast milk so often.  If you give her cereal 2-3 times a day, everday this will help reduce the amount of bottle feedings, it will take a few weeks for her stomach to get used to it but soon it will help.  Also, when she turns 6 months you will be able to start giving her baby food (vegies first) at time you will not have to give her a bottle so often, but you have to feed her everday the same amount.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Is she sleeping in another room, so that some of the times she wakes up she has a chance to fall back asleep? If shes with you, you will hear every tiny noise, in her own room, she will have times where she will wake, cry a tny bit and go back to sleep if you dont pick her up or let her see you. Breastfed babies get thinner milk it is normal for them to keep eating at shorter interols, thats why breast feeding is best, but it is also much more demanading on ones time.|`|2BQAfFC2aa	That's just what her body needs. Feed on demand. She will not overeat. What you're doing is fine. Once she hits 6 months try feeding her solid regularly everyday and she might slow down on the milk or at least space the feedings further apart.|`|G35ERUifaa	My daughter nurses that often as well (she's 6 months).  Does she sleep though the night?  My daughter has since she was 8 weeks old and I realized that every two hours really turns out to be 6 feedings a day, which is about what she should be doing.|`|PEw2L6Mgaa	maybe try giving her cereal everyday. she is a little older now and her body requires more food now they grow very fast and their stomachs are small so they eat often. After she gets used to the cereal maybe try giving her some baby food.
l0YvaYTDaa	I have been breastfeeding for 5 months now.  I started giving my son the odd bottle fairly early  (probably earlier than I should have), and he took it no problem.  At about 2-3 months I tried to feed him a bottle and her refused it.  I freaked out.  Since then, I've bought a decent breast pump, and tried to pump a couple times a week and have my husband give it to him just to keep him familiar with it.  We figured out that it has to be really warm for him to take it even now.  I guess since it comes out of me at 98.6 degrees, he needs it to be at that temperature all the time.  Since we've been heating it up to a fairly warm temp. he seems to take it without a problem.  If he is a little fussy, my husband will start feeding him the bottle while he's walking around, and once he takes it, he will sit down to finish.  We are using the Dr. Brown bottles, but I don't know if they are much different than what you've already tried.|`|GJEFaaTWaa	My daughter had to take a bottle at 2 days old bc I had to go to the Er. However, she didn't take another one until 6 weeks old. After that she rarely took one. Now at 8 months she refuses it. I left her with my mom bc we went on a trip and she would not take a bottle or milk in her sippy cup. I think maybe if I would have given it to her more often she would have done better with it. She will only drink water from her sippy cup now.|`|dpMssGdnaa	my baby never took the bottle she is 9 months and still breastfeeding. I did have to work for a month part time and my husband used to give her my milk with a spoon! LOL|`|83j1ThU7aa	sorry cant relaly help i only was able to breastfeed for a month :(|`|AAlB49iraa	My second child was breast fed until he was 9 months. he never wanted to take the bottle from me but eventually took one from his daddy and aunt. it helps to wait until they are Truly hungry, use breast milk that you pumped in the bottle, and to squeeze a little out of the nipple so that he/she can taste it on the end of the nipple. I loved Avent bottles and used them with both my kids. remember if at first you don't succeed.....try try again. its important for the baby to learn to take the bottle... since the breast doesn't detach to leave with the sitter when you need a night out with your man. ;)|`|DcLiW4bbaa	My baby is 8 weeks old now, and she has been breastfed, but I had to go back to work 2 weeks ago, so she's had to have a bottle. She does the best with the kind of bottle that is bent near the top. Maybe you could give those a try if you haven't already, it doesn't matter which brand. She was pretty good about taking to a bottle, though, I got very lucky.<br>  <br>  Just keep trying, she'll have no choice but to take it when she's hungry enough. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh, and you could also try to trick her. Like start breastfeeding her for a minute or two when she is really hungry, and then switch to a bottle of breast milk real fast, maybe she won't notice, lol. It might not work but hey, anything is worth a shot right?|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	well just boob i never did <br>  i breast fed for four months <br>  and he got one bottle a day since day three that way when i wanted to wean it would be easier <br>  try diffrent formulas <br>  do it when shes really hungry or sleepy <br>  be patient and dont gie up on that bottle thing if thats what u want itll happen it takes work|`|DLDweOcYaa	I did for 3 months.  My daughter took to the bottle straight away.  I use Avent bottles and she has no problems with it.|`|MeYILJeSaa	My son first took a bottle of breast milk on New Year's Eve. (He was about a month and a half) I seem to have gotten lucky though. He's very versatile. He doesn't mind taking a bottle although he really seems to miss Mommy if he hasn't had the "real thing" for awhile. He'll nurse for about twice as long if he's had the bottle. <br>  I guess I would just keep offering her the bottle? Maybe eventually she'll warm up to it?|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	I've been breastfeeding since day one and it's been almost 8 months.  I love nursing and I don't want to wean her anytime soon.  I want to continue nursing her until she is at least 2 years old.  She loves her sippy cup and a regular cup too.  My daughter loves to have a sip from my water bottle.  It's small enough for her to drink out of it.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	I never used a bottle- at least that my daughter would take. lol|`|iFmKcRl0aa	I breastfed for about a year. Our son was a little confused when he got his first bottle, too (and I think he was around the same age). Are you filling the bottle with breast milk or formula? If you're using formula, I would consider filling it with breast milk so that she's not facing too many changes at once.<br>  <br>  I think that if she gets hungry enough, she'll learn to cope with the bottle you give her. Make sure the one she has is age-appropriate. Nipples on bottles have a different number of holes depending on the age of the baby they are meant for (At least the bottles I used did. If there are too many holes, she might feel like too much milk is coming into her mouth at once). I would also just try one bottle and stick with it. Pick the one you think she *might* go for so that she's not unsure about what's happening between nursing and trying to adjust to a bottle.

But it depends on the child,early childhood situations and how they are being raised.
ZfRucXTMaa	There is an infomercial for Baby Can Read.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Toddlers do not have the attention span or mental capacity to memorize the phonics associated with reading.  This is a complete waste of money unless you have a gifted toddler who has an unusually long attention span.  Save the money and encourage you child developmentally by reading to him or her and talking to him or her.

Not only do you have to buy the initial system, but you also have to pay monthly to get updates.<br>  <br>  A more affordable option that teaches MUCH better is "Hooked on Phonics for Babies".

Not as risky as going early but still risky. It use to be common to let the mom go over 2 weeks but most docs won't do than anymore. If it is your due date then you can expect it any time now.

AA10736763	A homestudy is when a caseworker is sent to your home to evaluate your family, look at your home, interview each member.  It involves a health inspection and a fire inspection.  Unless you are adopting through the state, this will be an expensive thing to have done.|`|DPkE9ho3aa	It`s basically an evaluation of your house...an agent comes over and checks on your living conditions to see if you have a suitable home for the child or not!|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	The social worker will visit your home to see how your living!!|`|P2yRAWiJaa	It's when a caseworker comes by your home.

34VXCyvVaa	Is there some reason you don't want to admit that you met him while camping? If not, then just man up and tell your mom the truth. Tell her that she interrupted you while you were on the computer and only half paying attention and you just wanted her to go away at the time without having to go into any explanations then about how you really met him. And then tell her that the reason you're telling her now is because a) you do want to be honest with her, and b) you know she might meet his parents and don't want her to be embarrassed if she finds out he didn't go to your school/live in your town, etc. Whether she believes you will depend on how honest you've been with her in the past, but if that's the case, then all you can do is try to be honest with her from now on.|`|p25p9jTYaa	you're allowed to use the computer?!? after being threatened with stuff like THAT!?!|`|84fm7wskaa	what do you need help with today.
cteyFJxhaa	Part of growing up is accepting that you can't have everything your own way all the time.  You're starting to be a young lady and not a baby and I'm sure you'd prefer to be treated that way so this is one way for you to prove you deserve it.    Take 3 boxes and start sorting.  In box  1, you put any worn out or broken toys that are garbage.  In box  2, you put any toys that you don't use anymore but some other little boy or girl might like, and you put them aside for charity.  In box  3, you put extra special things that you want to keep, like a special teddy bear or doll.      Us as many boxes as you need for  1 and  2  but try and keep box number  3 down to one or 2 that can be packed away somewhere.    Then you ask mom if you can help her shop for the new dining room!|`|WQUeP4FZaa	dont u will want to have some memories.

You may want to keep these special things for your kids or just as memementos.    If there are toys you haven't played with in years and have no special connection to, gather them up and sell them in a yard sale in the spring.  Your mum will be happy because there's less stuff laying around and you will make yourself some cash. :)|`|ddP3klT3aa	Take them to the salvation army.

Next, realize that your daughter is YOUR daughter, and that you may have a lot of influence on her. So if you talk to your daughter and explain to her why its wrong, and why she shouldnt cuss at or in front of her daughter, that may help the situation alot. Let her know that you disapprove.

And in response to another posters answer about being an adult...    Your mother CAN ALWAYS tell you what to do and not to do...she's your mother...when you're 80...she'll still be your mother...

vue9NOhYaa	He won't choke.  Nature has set things up very cleverly. When a baby is able to pick foods up and put them in his mouth, he will also be able to gum them up and swallow them.  At worst, he might gag, but that keeps him from choking.<br>  <br>  However, at 5 1/2 months he's probably too young yet for self-feeding, esp. if he isn't yet sitting up.  <br>  <br>  So, there's no rush.  Continue with babyfoods (stage 2 is fine -- it's just like stage one but the jars are bigger) and, in a few weeks, or a month or two, he'll probably show signs of readiness and interest for table food, and you can try offering him some.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	My daughter started self-feeding at 7 months old.  I started by giving her Gerber Puffs and Zwieback toast.  Nowadays, she also has little bits of banana.  Just make sure they are really tiny, and watch him like a hawk while he's eating.  <br>  <br>  Some stage 2 foods are thicker in consistency than stage 1 foods.  If he has tried all of the stage 1 foods with no allergic reactions, go ahead and try some stage 2 foods.|`|n6NthDxwaa	I started my son on solid foods about 4-5mo. As long as he is able to sit up, even if in your lap, try small pieces. If he does start to choke, turn him over, and try to pat it out, or pull it out w/ your finger. All children are different, and it's only by trial and error you learn about your son. Mine is a year next week, and is eating nugget happy meals!|`|G35ERUifaa	Wait until he develops a pincher grasp (using thumb and forefinger to pick up objects).  Then start with Cheerios.  He may gag until he gets the hang of it, but he will be fine.

YmEGCGtnaa	yes I agree esp the pacifier thing---what if the baby has a cold? I know when my baby gets stuffed up the last thing she wants or needs is a pacifier in her mouth to block her from breathing through her mouth when shes too congested to breathe through her nose!<br>  also the no blankets thing is sooooo silly and stupid. I let my baby sleep in small but thick blankets draped underneath her chest. shes 7 mons and this has not presented a problem. i know plenty of ppl who have their baby in big thick toddler-size blankets when their babies are like 8 mons and though that's kinda risky, i don't think it's as risky as they make it out to be. i had followed all the sids recommendations 4 awhile, until my baby got sick once from her being so cold at night.<br>  <br>  i do however strongly agree a baby should stay in the parents' room til as long as possible---but if you do this, then you don't really need to follow the other guidelines bc you'd be in the room with them and hear them breathing/shuffling/shifting blankets etc.?|`|68c6B8dRaa	Do your research -- the pacifier thing is really not what it's made out to be; see <a href="http://www.aapd.org/upload/articles/adair-25-05.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aapd.org/upload/articles/adai...</a> for a start -- and use common sense and breastfeed and sleep very, very close to your baby, and stop worrying.|`|avx7bLnKaa	honestly my son co-sleeps with me and when he is in the crib I put him on his tummy ..... reasons why.... we sleep better<br>  and experience I did it with my first son after a couple of months of sleepless nights... and we have NO risk factors like low birth weight or smoking|`|BUI9HnH1aa	the only way i could get my son to sleep in his first 2 months of life , was on me while i was sitting in a arm chair .. and yes i slept too .<br>  he  now sleeps on his side and we have only just stopped using a sleep positioner. <br>  Hes 5 months old now and wen i go in to his room in the morning i find that he has turn himself around so his head is where hes feet are . He also likes to throw the blankets over his head , so im going out to buy some sleep suits because this scares me abit . <br>  i do keep a fan on in his room tho , i find the air circulation helps him sleep better .|`|XxZQ72J4aa	I'm into the last one on the list. Humans have slept with their babies for thousands of years---It's unnatural for newborn babies to sleep away from their parents. Being close to the mother allows the baby to smell her, hear her heartbeat and her breathing rate, which helps the infant keep breathing. Of course, married couples have sex on a regular basis, so it's okay to keep the baby in a crib right next to the bed in the same room.|`|dpMssGdnaa	I did all of them except the fan. I think they are good general rules|`|lEGq1nzoaa	I have a 10 week old and SIDS freaked me out for the first few weeks. But it is almost impossible to follow all of the guidelines. There are times when my daughter will not fall asleep unless she is on her side or her tummy. We also fall asleep together all of the time. I always said that I would never have my infant sleep with me but when we brought her home I was so nervous and I always wanted her right next to me! I also use baby powder which is a SIDS no no. I just make sure to open and close the bottle away from her face and sprinkle it gently so that I do not created a huge powder cloud for her to breathe in. My mother always laughs about all of the no nos. When I was an infant we were only allowed to sleep on our stomachs.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion.  All it really means is that they don't know why the baby died.  But the medical community has collected as much data as available on these deaths.  All the guidelines are based on analysis of this data.  They don't know what causes SIDS, therefore they have no idea how to prevent it.  All they can do is compare what they know about the lives of these babies with the lives of babies in the general population and note correlations.<br>  <br>  The biggest correlation is between stomach sleeping and SIDS.  A really huge decrease in the number of SIDS deaths was recorded after the campaign to put babies on their backs led to a large increase in babies sleeping on their backs.<br>  <br>  It's very troubling, but if you spend any time with research and statistics then anything you read on the subject pretty much screams "We don't know why it happens!"
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I asked the same question about my numbness upper right thigh on here, and it prompted me to go to the doc and ask. I did and they told me (after a through exam) that its just pinched nerves. Your uterus and baby are laying on a nerve cluster. They told me to move my position and try to only sleep on my left side and not stand in one position too long.|`|JvZY0ZS4aa	Oh yeah, this was one of my biggest 'tortures' while trying to get some sleep in the second and last trimesters with my pregnancies. In my case, it has been the sciatic nerve pinching thing. Lately I've had it only on my right side (as soon as I lay down on my right side I feel half my leg go numb) which basically limits my sleep positions to being on the left side.    We have a memory foam mattress now which really helps. Also the pillow between the legs, along with another under/around the belly helps. Lately I've found doing a series of leg stretches before going to sleep really makes a difference and I don't suffer with this as often as a result.    Still a ways to go. Good luck!|`|weE5FxCfaa	it is probably just nerves getting pinched by the growing baby pressing on your spinal cord.  i had this with my 3rd pregnancy, though i ws further along then you.  if you are really concerned ask your dr about ti at your next appointment.|`|kew2l7Acaa	Ask your dr just to be on safe side but it's probably just cos you're squashing them with your lump.|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	I dont know exactly about the Leg but I wake up very often with both hands numb, because I am sure I sleep on them, you know how I checked?

34VXCyvVaa	It sounds like she has good parents. Is she allowed to speak to with him on the phone? Would he be allowed to visit with her at her home while her parents are present? Can they talk to each other via IM? These aren't ways of getting around the parental rules as much as finding out how else you can get acquainted while still following the rules. I think if the parents realize that the guy is willing to respect their daughter and respect their rules, they would be more likely to allow him to have contact with her under certain circumstances.|`|1XcTZRemaa	They could:<br>  A) Go behind the girl's parents backs, and the girl just tells them that she's going out with a friend. This can be VERY risky, however, and if she gets caught, no more boy.<br>  B) Go out with a huge group of friends, so that's it's more or less a date, but the parents don't think so. This works pretty well, especially when the girl doesn't have to be specific about who went.<br>  C) Just go out to friend-places, like a movie or a coffee shop, and she tells her parents that she's just going out with a friend, and nothing more. This works, but again, it's risky - especially if the boy thinks they're dating, and her parents don't.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and that everything goes out okay.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvyCUOU_9Bof_PB7N44B5.nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219163918AArmEst">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> Help me out?|`|BY02DhfWaa	okay this is the deal , when you are not aloud to date and you like someone and they like you , what you do is you get a group of friends together and you all go out .|`|oHO0XOQVaa	You date in secret.

dPyfP0ijaa	If her symptoms persist, keep taking her in. Most docs are lame @sses and diagnose wrong.     Not sure about the blood count thing, you want to pay attention to white blood cell count. if your white blood cells are too high, it means there could be infection.    5 year olds shouldn't be getting headaches, but if the ct scan came back ok, you're probably ok, but you could always request an MRI.|`|AA12145826	I had mono when I was 18 and my WBC count (white blood cell count) was through the roof, however they didn't test that until later. Most doctors (and hospitals, I believe) use a test called the Monospot Test. To do the test, they put a sample of the patient's blood on a slide and combine it with a solution. If the blood clumps, that indicates a positive result.    Personally, I would get a second opinion. Do you have a pediatric hospital nearby (like say, within 2-3 hours away) that you can go to? The way I view it is this: Children are not little adults. Sometimes in cases like this, its best to go to someone who ONLY sees pediatric emergencies. At least if they give you the same answers you can rest a little easier.    I hope this helps, and I hope your little girl feels better real soon!!|`|Rn9SO1Wjaa	my daughter had the same symptoms with the headaches really bad heaches, so I took her to her pediatrician and he sent me to get her a scan done and it turned out to be sinuses!!!

Pulling out is the stupidest form of "birth control" out there, as it seriously doesn't make much of a difference. Pray for your period to come. As said before, wait another week. Take another test then, and don't confuse spotting for your period. Spotting is a very light bleeding that is easily mistaken for periods in women that have light cycles normally. My advice is to go to the doctor no matter what the test says and get a real test. DO NOT get back on birth control until you're sure you're not pregnant as it can cause serious defects and mental retardation in your child if you are pregnant. If you plan on continuing having sex, for the love of God use condoms.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	the constant changing of contraceptive methods many have mixed up your cycle a bit. If you took a test and it was negative, you probably aren't, but wait a week and try again... not much else anyone can suggest! Good luck!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	1st off it doesn't matter what timing you're using on the "pull out" method you can get pregnant.  Whether he pulled out too late or went back at it.  That is the most immature and irresponsible way of avoiding pregnancy.  I think you most likely are pregnant.  The symptoms you're describing sound about right for this early on.  The cramping after sex...I had that really bad and found out later it was implantation the 1st time and my uterus growing thereafter.  You don't want to be pregnant but you aren't using any birth control method?  I don't know exactly what you expect to happen.|`|b3ZV6PHOaa	go to the doctor and take a test   and have a abortion if you are  and don't want the baby .|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	Pull out method is hardly a method of birth control, please use condoms until you get on something more reliable. If your period is late but you've taken a negative test, you are probably ok, stopping the patch suddenly like that can cause your cycles to get very messed up, not to mention what halting a stream of hormones like that can do to your mood and emotions. I would test again to be sure, but what is most important that you get out of this is that you need a more effective form of birth control.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	The pull out method is not a safe form of birth control.  It's as if you didn't even use anything at all.  There is some viable sperm in pre-ejaculation.  And if he didn't go wash himself off in between, that too could have spread sperm to you.  It sounds to me like you're stressing yourself out over nothing.  Stress can cause you to be late.  I think you're psyching yourself into thinking you're pregnant, or it's too early for a test to tell accurately.|`|TOljxMLMaa	I would wait a little longer changing your birth control routine can change your cycle.  Id say your probablly ok.  Take another test to be on the safe side!!|`|ti3AEcIFaa	go to the doctor....i cant tell you.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	sweetie there's a thing called pre-*** that pulling out CANNOT avoid. stupidest method of "birth control" i've ever heard of. so yes u could be pregnant i would go to a clinic and find out for sure.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	wait a week take another test and go to the doc. thats the only way to find out|`|Eqln1jmNaa	so when you say protected, are you meaning the "pull out method" or are you meaning the pull out as well as a condom method...     if your using just the pull out method, good chance of being pregnant...|`|NUCCIFRtaa	Use a tester.. it's not too expensive i think...|`|JEnsHADCaa	Oh dear! Let me be the first to assure you that "pulling out" is not an effective form of birth control...speaking from experience, and contraceptives are never 100% reliable...only abstinence! Either way, the best thing to do now is see a physician. Pregnancy test work by picking up hormone levels in your urine and some women react slower to pregnancy than others, but you are also experiencing symptoms of IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), ovarian cyst, etc. About being pregnant after the use of the pill/patch...if you were not consistent with the usage, then yes, it is quite possible you are pregnant, but there is an equal chance that the symptoms you are having come from discontinuing the patch....you really should go have a chat with your GYN.     Hope this helps.|`|OzM5P1TIaa	its is possible .u can be pregnet.  take ur pregnancy test.|`|96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	I don't think you're pregnant if you're having negative pregnancy tests a week and a half after your period was due. I think you're having symptoms from just getting off birth control.    However, if you are actually trying to avoid pregnancy, use protection every single time. The 'pull-out' method is not birth control. Even condoms have a 15% chance of failing. Good luck.|`|2VNuWkzvaa	your most fertile when you get off birth control, you might or might not be. I dont want to scare by  saying you are, just wait until the end of the .week see if you get your period, if not test  again this monday|`|ylQPsjNAaa	I don't know if your pregnant. Wait a few days to a week and take another home test or go to the doctor and take a blood test. YES you can get pregnant from pulling out. He leaks pre *** which contain sperm. In that pre *** there are millions that get released and it only takes one to get pregnant. So it is very possible. Pulling out does not work. I know from experience!!!! Good luck

7MKmxkjlaa	Well wirte an anonymous note to your school cousellor giving (whoever is cutting themselves) name and teacher. And give your reasons for wanting to stay anonymous. And drop it by her office when shes not there.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	U should tell, it's the right thing to do!!  She's hurting herself & one day she may take it farther & kill herself & you may of not said anything...& blame you!!  It will be okay, & she needs help.  You can do it with out anyone knowing it was you!|`|mMBzpldbaa	you could help her by posting an anonymous letter to her parents or your school's headteacher (principle for you americans), parents, guidance councillor or school nurse.<br>  <br>  that way, you can help her and keep your name out of it :)|`|xggSASTwaa	you shouuld tell your school counselor, teacher, principle. just tell them you want to be anonymous.

That way they can keep an eye on your classmate and perhaps speak to her parents.  If you don't feel comfortable doing that, then you could type and mail an anonymous letter to the teacher or guidance counselor alerting them to the situation in case they can help somehow.
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Pregnancy hormones just dont go away the minute you lose your baby. They stay around a while and gradually get burned off. Its likely they are reading the levels from the first baby combined with the second. I would think they will continue to read the levels and if it goes down later, it will be likely a single, if it continues to rise you might be seeing twins. You are VERY fertile after a misscarriage but its not a good thing to get pregnant since you need time to let your body heal.|`|v3LnJycKaa	it is possible you are most fertile after miscarriage, but also keep in mind that levels are averages and not set in stone... they could be high or low as long as they rise accordingly, you can not accurately use level to measure multiple pregnancy she will need an u/s to diagnose.|`|weE5FxCfaa	i personally think that if she had a miscarriage in dec. then most likely it is left over hormones from that pregnancy. also is she for sure pregnant? because after a miscarriage you can get a false positive test for quite awhile.|`|MFBJDnOUaa	The other babies hormone levels are still showing up|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	i dont think there's any way of them knowing till they do an ultrasound i wouldn't just jump to thinking it's twins.|`|9x9WPoNHaa	If she's truly pregnant, because the levels may take a while to go down after being recently pregnant, the only way to confirm a pregnancy after birth or miscarriage is through ultrasound--it's probably the hormones from the previous miscarriage mixed in with the hormones for this new pregnancy. In any case, you cannot go by HCG levels to determine multiples, as they vary greatly from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy. The only way to confirm how many are coming is through an ultrasound. You can check out the site below for a reference guide for hcg levels.
JZnRxPUCaa	Well based on my pregnancy, I know exactly what it is like for the little one to wake you up in the middle of the night playing "kickball" lol. I had it as early as 16 weeks. It was more like flutters then though.  But what I have been told is that the reason you feel it the most at night say when you are in bed is because you are not moving around. So my guess is that when you are up during the day cleaning, cooking, working whatever it may be- rocks the baby to sleep. So in turn, he/she is sleeping while you are up, and then when you are down for the night he/she says well- now it is my turn to get some stuff done and decides to keep you all night!  I think it is normal.|`|IIvnrK0Naa	im 17 weeks pregnant and i feel my baby moving quite a bit. thats cool that your baby is already kicking so hard that its waking you up at night :)|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	i felt flutters, twice at 13 weeks... kicks by 17 and by 19, i felt a kick with my hand|`|DTg3USppaa	I'm 11weeks now and had my ultra sound yesterday and saw my little one moving all over the place. I have no doubts that you can feel your baby moving!!! It will only get stronger :) About how can you get your baby to move during the day... lay on your back for a little while and roll to one side then the other. It works for every other woman in my family :)|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	I felt 5 days ago really hard, he was really kicking I was shopping with the Friend and I got hungry and also I stood on my feet for long and It was first time baby moved, he was going Crazy in there, as soon as we sat down to eat and rested he stopped and I have not felt him since :( I was 16 weeks 1 day when he did that :)) I can not wait again|`|hT1bVVFraa	thinner women tend to be more sensitive to the feeling of their baby moving at an earlier date than the average 20-22 weeks. but enjoy it now while the movements make you laugh, because if my 37 week baby kicks my ribs or bladder one more time, I just know she will cause permanent damage! (hehe)|`|ZWrLzr0vaa	It is perfectly normal for your baby to start kicking after 17 weeks!! My daughter would kick and punch me and liked to use my bladder as a bouncy castle!!! maybe your baby sleeps though the day and is awake at night to play! but if you want your baby to move around more in the day then take a very cold drink or eat something sweet and lie down!! that should get your baby to move.|`|iMULlxdgaa	yeah its cute.  Until they get bigger!!!!  But hey I'm 37 weeks and my baby is soooo lazy. (its a boy too)  he kicks and I've had  athousand ultrasounds done and he seems ok but it gets on my nerves that he only kicks when I push one of his little arms or legs  or back side.  So I wish I had your problem!  I think mine is waaaaay to comfortable inside his little house.  I just hope he doesn't act like this when he's 20!|`|9iXGakohaa	It's completely normal. I'm 16 weeks and I've been feeling kicks for a week already! You can't really "make" the baby kick, but I know they are more likely to kick when they are startled by something. Like when I cough a bunch, or eat really greasy foods (bad I know). But it probably isn't good to purposefully startle your baby so just be patient, from what I've read they'll soon be kick non stop.    Congrats and good luck!|`|627pWyVkaa	Im 18wks and 3 days and I feel it daily now (but doesnt wake me up) i first felt a couple flutters at 15 once and 16wks once but a few more at 17 and now its daily! Yes its normal from 16 weeks-20 weeks to start to feel little ones, Maybe your a bit further along? or just your body type is making you feel them so strongly! You cant your baby is going to sleep when it wants too, its not like us and has all darkness inside of us, so its on its own schedule :)|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	i didnt feel any kicks at 17 wks but i did feel fluters|`|WPI0Z47saa	I am 20 weeks and he is a kicker. The reason you feel you baby at night is because when you walk and move around during the day you are rocking and soothing them to sleep. Obviously at night you are sitting still so they wake up and move around more. That is why their days and nights are mixed up after birth and they need to get used to a new schedule. You can get your baby to move during the day by sitting quietly for a little. Also I find that if you drink some orange juice the sugar will stir them up some.
9x9WPoNHaa	It depends; ovulation calculators are just an estimate, and it is completely possible that you ovulated earlier or later than what the calculator told you. For example, some women on 28 day cycles may ovulate on day 16 and have a luteal phase of 12 days after. It's still a 28 day cycle, however, ovulation occurs two days after expected.    Having that in mind, how long sperm can survive will depend on whether or not you were fertile. If you were fertile (close to ovulation or on ovulation day), sperm can survive up to 5 days, with an average of 3 days at most. Even then the probability of pregnancy is only about 25-30%, so there's still over a 70% chance that pregnancy will not occur.    Unfortunately the only thing you can do right now is wait. Having unprotected sex during the time you are expected to ovulate increases your chances of getting pregnant, but only time will tell. Good luck.|`|v3LnJycKaa	if you tried from the 23-25th, then the sperm from the 25th would be present and active on the 27th, generally if all conditions in the vagina are right, cervical mucus not hostile etc sperm can live 5-7 days.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	Male sperm up to 3 days, female sperm up to 5 days.    Chances are, if you've ovulated later, you might have just hit the jackpot if you wanted a baby girl.    However, a woman's egg after it's released lives only for 48 hours before breaking down.|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	I've always heard if the atmosphere is right, 3-5 days.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Around five days, sometimes longer.    You have a good chance.|`|627pWyVkaa	sperm can live upto 5 days some say as long as 7 But upto 5 days with optimum conditions of course not all sperm lives very long after ejaculating, hence why men have so many, its the way our species in terms survives!|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I believe that is up to 72 hours. THe best time to try is actually 2 days before you ovulate and NOT the day you are ovulating so that when the egg does drop it is meeting the sperm in the middle.|`|uVvOX9XHaa	YeS! Sperm lives up to 72 hours. you could very well be pregnant.|`|T7fVO1HFaa	There is a chance.  I've read fresh sperm can live anywhere from 48-72 hours, sometimes more.   So, I think there's a chance, but not a large one.   How long are your cycles?  When was the date of your last period?|`|PlqMl73Gaa	sperm can live in you for up to four days. It is assisted by your cervical mucus to help keep it alive. Your egg on the other hand is only good for 24 hours.|`|3CG3rby0aa	most sperm stays alive anywhere from 3 to 7 days.  just depends on how much sperm there was to start with.  You still have an open window of a chance for them to be alive by then. good luck!|`|DTg3USppaa	3-5 days  :) There is always a chance and it might be a pretty good chance. My boyfriend and I had sex even when I was ovulating and still there wasn't any result but when I relaxed and wasn't thinking about being pregnant while having sex, it happened. Now I am 11 weeks pregnant. 'Try not to try' to have a baby, it seems as though when you try, it never happens! So just have fun and out of nowhere sex! Those are the times where you are relaxed and have your cervix open :)|`|hmRFSj5waa	Your egg is only viable for 24 hours ideally.  Sperm is only viable up to 72 hours but it has been documented in some cases to be up to 96 hours.  The acidity of the enviroment eats their tails and more than half of them go the wrong way.  Only about 100 reach the egg.  Honestly it's amazing anyone gets pregnant at all.  I have no idea where these other people got their information. Good luck!

Go to the dr though its what they are for, especially since she is so young.|`|HqS6TiiQaa	wow, you nurse a 2 yr old, thats sick. You should go see a doctor.    children would prefer a "baba" till they are 5 but normal mothers cut this by 2.    Take your kid to a DR. its obvious she is sick. Goodness Gracious Lady!|`|3KyVMVncaa	You should call your doctor. Start giving her Pedialyte to replenish the fluids and electrolytes shes vomiting out. If she gets too dehydrated she could end up in the hospital. Its good she has no fever, but I would recommend calling her doctor today just to ask what to do. Maybe they will tell you shes fine, or they may want to see her. Good luck and I hope your little princess feels better soon!|`|bPHU2JKaaa	make sure she don't get dehigrated (sp?) and u still breast feed her at 2? wow!|`|huto12P3aa	I would ring the doctors, tell them what you've said here, then if they need to see your daughter then you'll have to take her there and just get her checked.|`|udP6fJ6maa	You really need to take her to the Doctor because she could have an infection, or something going on with her digestive system.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	If she's been sick since sat.

I would take her to the doctor just to be sure there isn't an intestinal problem !!!|`|ONZTky1Jaa	?????????????????????|`|kqnaqakLaa	take her to the doctor. sounds like a stomach virus. something small to you and me, but can be deadly for a 2 year old. or, i'm just over reacting. give her some sprite and saltines.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	thats a ridiculous reason not to go to the doctor... this is your childs health we are talking about here... go to the doctor that is NOT normal.|`|JjbragXNaa	Sounds to me like the flu.  They can get really bad and then be ok.  We went through this with all three of my toddlers about a month ago.  Just make sure she stays hydrated and I wouldn't take her in unless it doesn't go away for another week.  And if she gets a fever, don't freak out and take her in.  That's her body trying to fight whatever it is she has...just treat it if she's uncomfortable.    I've been there and freaked out many times and ended up in the doctors office for nothing.  Just wait it out, I'm sure she'll get better soon.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Sounds like a stomach bug. If its caused by a virus then theres no use in a doctor.  But if shes not eating then you have to take her to make sure she doesn't get dehydrated or starve.|`|Irdj2KAFaa	Error on the side of caution and take her to the doctor. Lack of fluids combined with throwing up & diarrhea leads to dehydration.     She could be allergic to something your eating or drinking; not necessarily a virus. My guess is allergies; that's been my experience with my 3yr old and 4 month old.|`|2YSr4Hzlaa	well just take her to the doctor. ur the mom so just do it|`|wntdMR8caa	Probably some kind of virus. She could have gotten it while her mother was too careless to take her to the doctor. ohh wow, your the parent, take control, and get her some help.
Tvq32ptlaa	I've got 3 boys (6, 8, & 11)  They've been doing chores for years.  What we did was numbered a paper 1-6 for each boy and then selected age appropriate chores for each boy.  Then every weekend (Fri, Sat & Sun) they roll a die to see what chore they have to do.  It makes it into a sort of game too.    You know your daughters abilities better than us but a few suggestions:  Sorting laundry  load/unload dishwasher - help with dishes  feed pets  fold laundry (towels, matching sock pairs)  putting away her laundry  setting the table  helping make supper  Of course you have to have 1 FREE PASS on there but you have to make limitations to it.  (once per week/weekend, etc)    If you make it fun for her she'll enjoy doing it.    P.S. we also use this type of "chart" for punishments and the boys helped us pick out punishments (they chose 3 and we chose 3), and a great idea for rewards too once the chores are done.    Good luck!!!|`|KA4dVajlaa	I have a chore chart that I made for my kids it has simple stuff on it as my kids are 4 and 6 I did it on the computer in blocks and and seperated it by days each day as a number of chores for instance my kids have to clean there room, put dirty clothes in the laudry basket, put away shoes, my daughter LOVES to set the table my son has to put the dish's in the sink when dinner is over stuff like that they have about 7 of those a day they are easy and at the end of the week they get money for it.  We give them 1.00 a day if they did all there chores for every chore they do they get a check mark and then at the end of the week they get there money. If they have one X in one of there chores for that day then they don't get any money for that day.  Most of the time they are good and they get 5.00 as we don't make them stick to the chores as much on Saturday and Sunday they kinda just help us around the house on the weekend, my daughter LOVES to vaccum and dust|`|V31Vs0nJaa	have her do things such as put away the silverware (forks spoons etc) i remember doing that when i was a kid... just make sure she knows that they are sharp. if you think shes too young for that have her try dusting off furniture but then again u might have a chance of having something break... you could make sure she cleans after her own messes such as picking up toys or if she spilled something to clean it up that way she is learning to take care of herself at the same time. 5 years might be too young to be doing real chores but if learning is involved then thats a plus.    and of course reward her even if its the smallest thing. the sticker thing is a good idea, if she gets so many stickers then she can get a reward or whatever (like a weeks worth). reward her with her favorite candy, or a toy from the toy store... but i wouldnt reward with money, at least not until shes much older.    make the chart on the computer, maybe like a calendar. put 1 sticker on the day she does a chore. if she does more than 1 chore on that day, put as many stickers as she has done. then when it gets to a weeks worth of stickers (7 stickers, or how ever many u want - or have her do chores for a whole week, and the more stars she has the better the reward) then reward her with something she will enjoy.|`|ejJD6BBXaa	my parents do the samething each month we get a new chart and if we finish our chores 4 that day than we get a star sticker and if we dont than we cant have any fun that day and if if we dont get all stars 4 that week than we mis out on something we wana do i have a 5yr old sister 8 yrold brother 11 7 12 yrold sister and im 18 so the list is good 4 all ages|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i think if you make a chart and laminate it and maybe have pictures of what she is supposed to be doing on velcro so she can put them on the chart when she is done? my boys are younger and we dont have a chart but they do things like pick up all the toys in their room,put clothes in the laundry basket,brush teeth, put their dishes in the sink after breakfast. i guess it depends on what she is able to do. i dont believe in giving a reward for doing chores only because it is everyones job in the family to help and i dont want our boys to think they need to be rewarded for something they are supposed to do. but every family is different!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	What ever you come up with be consistent with it.|`|2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	We started our son at age 5 also..He had to take out the trash everyday, pick up his room before bed , make his bed in the morning and put his folded clothes up in the correct drawers..We didn't give stickers we gave an allowance at the end of the week..If he did not do his chores he got no allowance..Don't expect her work to be as good as yours and praise her when she remembers to do it on her own..You can make a chore chart but we found  it was easier to just assign a few chores and they were to be done everyday, so it became routine.|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	Yup just come up with a few little chores and make sure you stick to it - don't let her get away with not doing them, or doing them yourself because it's "just easier to get it done" because that mentality will follow her throughout her life. Good for you :)|`|qB4KvbDiaa	works for me|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My daughter is 4 and we do chores with her like:  picking up toys in her room  setting the silverware on the table  Her favorite is folding blankets and placing pillows|`|VnRECJJxaa	i tnhink a reward should be given at the end of each week if she did all her chores    and her chores should definately be simple ones for now, like cleaning up her toys and making her bed|`|kT7GVOosaa	my niece is almost 4 and she has a small chore chart. she does very simple chores over the week. each day she has a different chore. each day she gets a sticker for completing that chore. at the end of the week if she has done all of her chores my sister-in-law will take her to the park to play (weather permitting) if it is to cold out she will take her to a McDonald's with a play place or our mall has a playground inside of it. it gets everyone out of the house on Fridays and her daughter is learning responsibility.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	When I was growing up we didn't have a reward system.  My father said, "There is no reward for doing what is expected of you except for pride in a job well done."  If they make extra effort, like doing things without being told, doing them especially quickly or well, that's another story.  But please don't teach your child to only do things if there's something in it for her.  There are enough of those people in the world.    ADDED:    I didn't mean to imply you were training her to be selfish, just a cautionary tale to please avoid it.  Sorry!
DHyUnhS1aa	If you want a child of your own blood then you're only option is surrogacy.  I believe some women do actually donate eggs for use by others (they are paid for this of course--much more than sperm donors because the process to extract eggs is neither pleasant nor easy).  I do not know what kind of information you are allowed access to about the donors though.  I've got to be honest, I really doubt women with those standings would need the money from donated eggs.  And I'm sure they'd have better things to do than be a surrogate.  I doubt women who are strangers to you with your qualifications would do it.  Do you have any high-standing female friends you might be able to persuade?|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	surogacy is your only option, Agencies dont usually go for the whole single parent thing, especialy the single father thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  and you are trying to design your own child and i find that horrible! Find a partner, get married and then have kids.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Sounds like you are not ready to be a parent if you want your kid to turn out to be all of those things.<br>  <br>  <br>  Accept what you get! What if the child came out mentally or physically handicapped even though all your specifications were met?|`|btIDOI04aa	Its called finding a wife.  I know she will nag you to death.  Have fun.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I understand my little boy just changed positions on me because he dropped she is probably getting ready for delivery.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	babies can flip flop even up to the day of delivery. Hopefully she stays head down and ready!!!
L8eNBQelaa	thinking about my ultrasound gives me a flood of wonderful memories. it meant so much to me to see my beautiful baby inside of me. as soon as i saw him i cried. the lady told me that i was definately having a boy because she could see him tugging at IT. lol it was such a relief to find out that everything was growing properly and he looked healthy. good luck, i hope you enjoy your experience as much as i did.|`|4QCYjPYhaa	I get an ultrasound every month at my appointment but my dr was not able to see the gender when it should of been first detectable because the legs were crossed.  I went in for my 3D ultrasound and they were able to see everything clearly.  The ultrasound they do is by far better than the one I see every month in my drs office.  I was fortunate enough to have that specialist want to see me later in my 2nd trimaster so I was able to see my baby boy again, he now wants to see me in my 3rd too so I will be able to sneak a peak again at him, he said the facial features will be more defined and make better pictures.|`|jCvdW3WGaa	Lol, i have an ultrasound the same day! I'll be 25 weeks, so definitely far enough to be able to tell. They can tell the gender by about 13 weeks. It's so exciting isn't it? My husband nearly cried when we heard the heartbeat for the first time, so it'll be interesting to see how he goes at the ultrasound!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	My doctor didn't check until 25 weeks pregnant. I'm high risk and have had 7 ultrasounds. Of those 7, 4 were far enough to show the gender. She has never hid her parts. lol <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	U can NOT tell until your 5 months!!|`|iKPSOMiSaa	thats funny! i get my gender ultrasound on mar 11th too and i cant wait. ill only be 18 weeks though but in my last pregnancy i was 19 when they were able to tell so you should be fine. there are problems sometimes when they cant see good enough to tell but those are rare and they will look for a long time if they have to because they know how excited you are. good luck!|`|IlSALGKMaa	My first ultrasound was about a week ago, and I was only 16 weeks. The baby was still too small to determine gender, so my next appointment is March 3rd and I think they'll schedule the anatomy ultrasound a few days after. I'm really excited, too. I think mine will be about the same time as yours. l should be about 19-20 weeks then.<br>  <br>  Edit: I think the first heart beat hearing is a lot more emotional then the ultrasound.. I think it's just being able to hear the babies heart that gets to me. My mom broke into tears.. My boyfriend nearly cried, but since my mom was crying, he was comforting her.|`|1f7by8LAaa	i found out at 14 wks i was having boys and they had their legs wide open lol. it really depends on the position the baby is in and if you have a good sonographer. they used the vag probe then but i got good pictures and a face full of manliness lol. there was another time where one of the boys were laying on their side and you could see a little floater in between his legs lol. just make sure that you have them check throughout your pregnancy to make sure nothing has changed because i hear that with girls, it takes longer to tell the difference between girl and boy for whatever reason. i still have my sonographers check and i will deliver in 19 days by c-section because we have all boy stuff. dont be nervous its very fun and interesting and exciting and you can start looking at all the cute clothes for your baby!!!!|`|fHgbL046aa	I had an ultrasound at 9 weeks(you don't see much). I had another one at 13 weeks and again February 17 and I was 19 weeks ans 4 days. <br>  I don't want to know the sex of the baby, but my boyfriend wants to know. He asked the technician if she knew what the sex was. She said she couldn't get a good look because he(I think its a boy)was squirming around to much. It was hard enough just to get the pictures she needed. <br>  I can't believe one girl got to see her baby in 3/4D cause in Ontario Canada you have to pay for that. Also the other girl that gets an ultra sound every month. Your so lucky I would love to be able to take a peak every month. Not sure if I'll be getting another one. I would love to get the 3/4D ultrasound when I'm further along. Its very exciting.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Yeah my gender ultrasound went great we got to see her little limbs and she was in a perfect position to see she was a SHE!<br>  Plus my doctor switched it onto a 4d ultrasound and we got to see her perfectly.<br>  It was the happiest part of my pregnancy this far!<br>  Good luck!|`|hw3OMoeZaa	I actually found out at 15 weeks and then we confirmed it again at 19 weeks.  It was a very good view and we got it early.  Good Luck to you

Ashton has always sounded like a chick name to me. Maybe because my name is Ashley.|`|doLyOac0aa	Sorry i don't like any,|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	I like Preston so much better because Ashton for some reason sounds effeminate to me...maybe because of Ashley and Ashlyn. Also, an Ashton might be called Ash and I don't like that. Preston sounds to me like the guy is very appealing. If you are writing a book, you need to have confidence in the names you choose. That is the fun of being the author.|`|zXcaTKqRaa	Loreli and Rori? Whoa, that's the mother and daughter's names on gilmore girls.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I like Ashton better. You don't hear a lot of boys named Ashton nowadays (beside Kutcher, of course). Preston sounds sort of ritzy and stuck up to me, and is sort of nerdy, like Eugene. Ashton sounds pretty sexy, in my opinion. Good luck.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I like the name Preston better, cuz it's Britney's older son's name, well actually it's his middle name but they call him Preston.  But for a rich, blonde guy i think Ashton works better, lol not sure why it just seems more like a rich guys name to me.  Hope this helps and good luck with ur story, :D.|`|jfLAZGXFaa	The name Preston would really fit the "rich: character good. Ashton reminds me of Ashton Kutcher who is a nasty *** whole. and isn't a very good name so go with preston|`|AA11273571	I love the name Preston because of Robert Preston in "The Music Man."  You're probably too young to remember the movie, but he was very sexy and smooth in it.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Preston.|`|7ee80ac8606af76cab55c3608e92fedeaa	I'm leaning for Ashton.|`|rtx7GUCdaa	Preston sounds like a rich blonde persons name Ashton not so much.<br>  good luck with your book!!|`|8MHBFCM6aa	I knew a boy named Preston in school.  He was very sweet.  He had blonde hair, just like your character.  Preston and Loreli or Preston and Rori sound cute together.  Good luck on your book, no matter what name you choose!|`|bb2SJvpSaa	PRESTON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|BjDJfagmaa	I prefer Preston|`|k4gXIxJNaa	Ashton that is the coolest name ever. Or maybe Damien either one.|`|dnEmjUkNaa	it depends<br>  <br>  i think preston is more of a snobby name, so if he is a really sweet guy then i would go with ashton|`|jHDeIPEfaa	Preston.|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Preston Esquire
75HzIpSraa	That should be okay but I'd talk to your doc about the cramping!  Make sure to listen to your body =)|`|DzGKfdKnaa	Yes because when your pregnant your body will tell you (by discomfort) when you should stop.|`|dYluozLHaa	mymom would excersise when she was pregnant with me, but dont do anything involved with running, it will make you sore and if your pregnant thiings will be hurting twice as much, but swimming is the best, its a cardio work out, you stretch your muscles without getting sore you flot and it doesnt put load on you, and i read its very good for the baby, try doing relaxing things because the more stressed you are the more that will imprint on your baby=) good luck|`|hw3OMoeZaa	My Dr. told me if you were already doing it then go for it, but don't start in middle of pregnancy.  You may have to change some of the moves because of the nerves in your back but look at www.welcomehomebaby.com they have some real good sights online.  Good Luck|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	That is perfectly fine... also have you thought of some strength training? You can use an exercise ball and at <a href="http://www.babyfit.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfit.com</a> there are tons of great exercises as well as free nutrition and fitness trackers.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	That's fine..doing exercises in 10 min segments 3 times is the same as doing the exercise for 30 minutes.
zwctZ812aa	Yes, they can teethe that early.  My 3 month old (13 weeks) has been teething since about 7 weeks.  At his 8 week appointment the doctor said she could feel his tooth coming in, but it still hasn't cut through. It can be a long process.  The signs you're looking for are excessive drooling, chewing on their own hands, your hands, anything that gets near their mouth, fussiness, and sometimes loose bowel movements, red cheeks and fever.  The fever usually comes when the tooth is actually cutting through, not in the days/weeks/months leading up.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Babies can actually be born with teeth!  It's possible, but most kids teethe at an average age of 6 months, but that's only average, so it could be that.  But at this age, babies are discovering the mouths and hands, doing a lot of chewing, and for digestive purposes, they build up in saliva.  They can also be getting bored at this age, making them cranky, all of these signs appear to be teething when they're actually not.  Making it slightly confusing!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	my daughter cut 2 teeth at 12wks so yes they can  red cheeks , unable to settle a little hot, more dribble than normal  or no signs x|`|mlT1ZrZtaa	baby's can teeth from a really young age so yes that is find  some symptoms of teething are  -nonstop crying  -don't sleep  -drinking funny  -and also being quite clingey  congrates|`|toOzi7aLaa	Yes! Some babies are even born with teeth|`|Z1FdawAOaa	yes its possible my nephew was born with two teeth!|`|E4L9fiIqaa	I think my daughter started teething at 10-12 weeks. She was super fussy and I could feel that it was pinching more when she breastfed. Her temperament seems to be better now but no teeth so I am thinking that she is used to the dull achy-ness. She still does drool a lot and I still feel that her gums are more stiff.
aXnVFFUkaa	get checked out at the hospital if you are worried my labour always started with diarrhea|`|y38cvIn9aa	If you are really worried and not feeling right, you need to insist to be seen. Never take chances with your baby, your doc should understand that. However, I have been having the same type of intestinal uncomfortable type of feeling lately. Not pleasant. I'm not having anything in my pelvis that hurts. Is it pressure from the baby maybe? Make sure if you are worried that you get the doctor to look at you.

cCXGEZxaaa	You definitely have a right to be angry, that crosses a MAJOR line. Though it's true that you weren't planned the fact that your mother went to a doctor and found out that she couldn't have anymore children after your sisters implies that she wanted another child. You may not have been planned but a pleasant surprise!|`|55aba19c6c9d9f4e98e2303268e9a73faa	Kudos to you for not slapping the *****. That was way over the line. <br>  You totally have the right to be angry at your mothers friend.<br>  <br>  Did your mom defend you at all?

cen8SIssaa	i dont know the should part b/c i also wonder the same thing....    however my son is 15 months and he is still eating baby food for the majority of his nutrition but through out the day he will have everything real food...    so that way he is still getting all his nutrition and is learning how to keep eating regular foods.    Great luck to you!|`|toOzi7aLaa	Feed him baby food until he no longer wants it.   He will slowly out grow the need for it and be on table food|`|DxdQ3F1iaa	maybe until he has his teeth grown to the pint where he could chew and eat on his own|`|pXSKSS3daa	"I do mash up our table food, but he never eats very much..."    Well, that's because you're giving him jarred food. It's much easier to eat, obviously, and he doesn't have to work to feed himself. At one your son should really be on more table foods and less jarred food.    My son will be 10 months old tomorrow and rarely has jarred food. The only time is if we go out for dinner and there isn't much available to him. I carry some in the diaper bag for "emergencies" and that's it.    Start offering him more table foods. It WILL take him some time to adjust but he won't starve either. The first time we offered table foods was around 7 months and it took our son literally a good hour before he got even half of it in his mouth. Now he can eat a small bowl full in about 15 minutes. As with everything it takes practice and patience.|`|dPyfP0ijaa	You can mash up your regular food and make it like baby food for him. Usually once he's got a few teeth, he can eat solids.     Rethink your home cooking|`|wzXJOSIeaa	He can have baby food however long he want, but I'm suprised your little man doesn't want table food instead. My son is 9 months and eat both table food and baby food, the only reason he is still on baby food is because it's so convient when we go somewheres. In fact, the baby food is probably better for your baby anyways because it doesn't have all that salt and seasoning in it. Let him decide when he wants to stop eating baby food, he will let you know when he is ready to make the complete switch.|`|XmO3nFSLaa	While it is ok to feed them some baby food at this stage you should really be introducing as many different flavors and textures...with my first child the dr said it was ok that she didnt like textures of veggies or meat just to give those as baby food and she is 3 now and is still not a fan of  meat and veggies, i think that has alot to do with it...with my now 13 month old I give him everything I eat and he will eat ANYTHING...no matter the flavor or texture....so as long as you still give the child an aray of things all is well...hope I helped!
MzqZGvalaa	I can remember one episode, (what about me? I'm a Mum, I don't watch it by myself, honest) where Thomas has to take a birthday present to a girl called Alice who lived at the top of the big hill.  The weather was inclement and Rosie was annoying Thomas by copying everything he did, and following him around.  There are two ways up the big hill, and Thomas decides to take the quick route which is also steep and dangerous, because he doesn't think Rosie will be able to follow him.  (I can't believe this) Anyway, long story short, Thomas gets stuck, Rosie saves Thomas and delivers the birthday present to Alice and everyone lives happily ever after.  The end.<br>     <br>  Does that help at all?|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I've never heard of that engine before ( LOL That sounds ludicrous coming from an adult but I know you understand). Maybe you can do a search on imdb.com (Internet Movie Database) and see if there's an episode listing you can look it up on? <br>  <br>  It might be an older episode, I'm not sure. I like Ringo Starr's narrating SO Much better but they almost never show those. :(
aXnVFFUkaa	get some professional advice just in case|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Call a doctor or go to the ER!|`|eb9Mptu3aa	You're getting awfully close to your due date. It sounds like the baby is putting pressure on nerves around the uterus. The swelling is probably not related to the pain, but just a bit of excess fluid. The closer I got to my due date, the more swelling I had. If you are really worried, check with your doctor. Pre-eclampsia is a possibility with severe swelling.|`|w9jx0JYLaa	well..i am 34weeks 4 days..and i just came on yahoo to pretty much ask the same thing...for me the pain goes away while im walking, but as soon as i sit down or stand I start getting cramps in my stomach, as well as pain shooting up my back and down my butt and legs.
dFHsAXDMaa	Jenny as a nurse I would say go to the Doctors a simple blood test can answer all these questions for you in one shot and even as a nurse I would not venture a guess as to what is causing the symptoms. Could be any number of reasons. Better safe than sorry|`|QCUPeW8aaa	I didn't have any pregnancy symptoms the whole time I was pregnant.<br>  I got my positive pregnancy test at 5 weeks ( a week after I missed my period) because I didn't test til than cuz I didn't have any reason to believe I was pregnant.<br>  Everyones body reacts differently and you cannot relate to anyone elses experience if you believe you are pregnant wait another week and test again if it is stil negative and you think its wrong than talk to your doctor about a blood test they are much more accurate.<br>  Good luck|`|mqHL4UcRaa	I didnt have nausea or taste aversions in early pregnancy. I think I became nauseous at around 4-6 weeks (after I knew I was pregnant)<br>  <br>  My symptoms 1 week before my missed period were fatigue, sore/swollen breasts that felt like needles were poking them when barely touched, and period-like cramping (caused by the uterus stretching/expanding)<br>  <br>  I took a test 2 days after my missed period and it was positive.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4QCYjPYhaa	That is very possible.  With my first daughter I was 9 weeks before I finally found out I was pregnant and that was determined with a blood test.  I was put on some vitamins that day that increased my hcg levels.
yOLeRiTZaa	~_~.    With all due respect young man....ARE YOU CRAZY !!!!    What you're suggesting is NOT only IS abortion, It could kill your girlfriend! There is NO SUCH Instrument available besides.    IF it has been under 72 hours since conception, there is a pill called "Plan B", which will cause the embryo to dis attach from the uterine wall and she will..like begin her menstrual cycle and it will flush away. (Sorry I am trying to be NOT SO graphic) If it has been over 72 hours, you need to get her to a Planned Parenting Clinic A.S.A.P. & weigh out the options. The "Plan B" you will have to obtain from the clinic as well.    If keeping the baby IS NOT an option, and carrying the baby to term isn't either, you have NO CHOICE but abortion. I personally don't believe in it, but I just want to educate you a'lil'bit.  I certainlt DO NOT want any harm to come to your girlfriend. I am soory for calling you crazy..I simply want your attention.    I won't give you a lecture on birth control, but don't touch your girl again until you have it.    I truely wish you and her THE BEST, & I HOPE you will do the right thing the RIGHT WAY.    You WILL be on my watchlist!!!  K?  Take Care.    _________________________ ~_~.      .
FkGh0LuWaa	If it is something he just started he may have an ear infection or something else going on.  I would give his doctor a call just to be safe.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	check to see if crying gives him headaches  ,or it could be a way of him telling you leave me alone|`|V31Vs0nJaa	i think it might depend on how old he is really if hes an infant then maybe there is something wrong but if hes a toddler just having a temper tantrum then there might not be anything wrong. if hes old enough to talk try to get him to tell u wants wrong but if hes not that old yet then try feeling around his head for lumps (like a bruise) and the areas he holds his hands.

RNZaUdxSaa	I think it is fine.. Although I would spell it Kayden but still cute!|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Kaden Michael is my favourite!|`|99Dvcw29aa	i think you should go with Kaden Michael because Kaden and Adam are both 2 syllables and end with rhyming letters.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I think Kadan is way over-used and you should come up with a different first name.  There are going to be tons of Aidens, Kadens, Braydens and Jaydens in your kid's class.  Do you really want him to be Kadan D for the rest of his life (or whatever your last initial is)?|`|FvAl3UgQaa	Definitely think Michael sounds far better...sorry!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I like kaden michael.Adam does not sound great with kaden.|`|7ePjzDZTaa	kaden adam is fine    it doesnt have to flow well|`|CEuxMzaXaa	Are you opposed to two middle names? Many people are doing that now. You could call him Kaden Michael Adam .|`|CUUjvakpaa	Kaden Adam is good|`|kfeXJVTWaa	You Shall Name Him Kaden Adalius Maximus!!!|`|NrlQsShWaa	Hi, I am Alessandra from South America.  I would like to suggest some middle names to be with Kaden:  Kaden Stephen  Kaden James  Kaden Joseph  Good luck!|`|ryDqMraZaa	i really like the name Kaden but to be honest it sounds bad with adam i like it alot with micheal|`|0MDY68ujaa	i like kaden adam..  but may i suggest brady instead..  obviously tht would have to go good with yer last name but i think its sounds great together..|`|A7ovwP94aa	Kaden Michael is a more classier name but if you want is middle name to be Adam then why not. It does ot flow well but it is ok. Why don't you have 2 middle names like someone else suggested.|`|EXWpMIZJaa	i luv the name Kaden sooooo cute!!!!!!!!!! umm but i like Kaden Michael MUCH better btw sooo yea stick with that

At least my niece does.  So have them help make the stuff for the spa treatments.  You can have oatmeal facials, cucumbers for the eyes and so forth.|`|ZgsPLlqLaa	instead of doing the makeover at home contact a local spa treatment business in your area and find out what it would cost to have the party there and let them do the treatments. they might have packages that include the cake and stuff.  compare what it would cost you to have it at home if you furnished everything including cake and decorations etc...  it might be more economical to have it at a spa.  hope she has a good time.
CMuL7XpKaa	I know 2 boys named Blake (12 & 5) and a girl (3) so it's an up and comming girls name. It's Cute. I hope more girls will use Blake & Tom (my name is Tom). Not much more but enough so people don't think it's strange|`|dPULl5hjaa	Blake - not my style for either a girl or boy.    Did you ever ask your parents why did they give that name?  It's unusual to say the least.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	No, it's cute!! It seems like it would be the name of someone from a soap opera! =)|`|xhVe918waa	No it's not very weird. :]    Btw, you're not the only girl named Blake..    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Livel...|`|99Dvcw29aa	i know many girls named BLAKE its beautiful and i dont like it on a boy so be happy with your beautiful name.    this girl my sister babysits is named Blake Angel and i think thats the prettiest name ive ever heard|`|7KDL9Wo3aa	No Blake is not weird at all! My best friend's middle name is Blake, after her grandmother.|`|CEuxMzaXaa	No Blake is a nice name for a girl. When I was younger I use to say my name - Jenny - over and over again and it sounded weird to me too. I like the name Blake.|`|9UfJHW8Saa	No, It's one of those names that can go either way  But is just uncommon for girls.  My girlfriends Sister's name is Dylanne.  So really it's just like  you know, how they decide and stuff.|`|NUCCIFRtaa	No, for me it's cute... Why you not ask your parents why they gave you that name ? Maybe they have a speciaL reason ?|`|Jx3955V9aa	I think its a great name.  It is original and cute.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.|`|A7ovwP94aa	You will have an unusual name and when you get older you will be thankful.|`|ztug2gLjaa	It's a cute and different name.|`|32K93DP4aa	its cute|`|kCiizn5oaa	I love it! Your very lucky! I'd always thought of Blake as a girls name.|`|i2RSpZ6caa	I always thought Blake was a boy name but it's cute for a girl. And Blake Lively is probably going to make it more popular for a girl. You have a nice name!|`|1768faf9e5b2a30b04ec84addc43d163aa	Its not weird. It's just very unique for a girl!|`|PJMqyjNtaa	Get over it  obviously you like it enough to talk about it  its a boys and girls name  who really cares if you think it is so WEIRD
mjy0QYjhaa	I have a 16 month old and a 12 week old baby.. with my two older children i had a side by side and really struggled in shops and doorways etc... This time i have bought a tandem called the Cosatto duet lite..front is for the toddler and the back has three reclining positions including totally flat for a newborn. Its really easy to push and steer..the lightest tandem i have tried..id recommend this pushchair!! good luck with the new baby!!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I would always recommend the phil n teds, although they are fairly heavy. If you have to carry them upstairs or move the pushchair a lot I would say be careful as they really are quite heavy. They are great because when the toddler isn't using it, it's a single pushchair with a great shopping basket.    The mamas and papas twin aria is the lightest I've ever known, but can only be used as a double, so not as versatile.|`|jCFOJAH4aa	I agree with Betz. I have twins and I own the Mamas & Papas twin aria buggy (side by side). It's the lightest pram I've ever come across, (And I shopped around quite a bit when I was expecting). They also do the same buggy for toddlers & newborns. The difference is the width of one side of the pram is bigger (for the toddler) and the other side is slightly smaller. Totally recommend that one for you. Good Luck!!!
D35xKICoaa	God is able to help you what the doc cannot do God will do just continue to pray and tell him your problem Good luck ( ) ( )|`|O4ty1tjjaa	Hi,  I had the same issue as you when i was young.  the first time i got my period it lasted 6 months.  until recently, my doctor had no idea what it could be.  She tested my LH levels and found that i have PCO.  polycystic ovary syndrome.  She ruled it out before because the majority of woman who have it have less periods, not more.  In my case its just the way it is though.  I had a miscarriage in november, my periods are still irregular.  Im not sure if that's what you have, but know that it took a long time for them to diagnose me (from age 12 to 21)  You have been pregnant once, I would say that's a good sign for you.  And look on the bright side, too much is better than none at all!  I hope I helped a bit.  Don't give up.  keep researching|`|L9khUU1caa	i dont know hun, but my last 5 years my period have been messed up, ithey stopped completly, but in last year months been getting them, but only once every two months or so, and ive been trying for 4 years without getting ptregnant
y7Mwptsraa	This is very normal. Continue to clean the cord with peroxide, and crusted part will eventually fall off.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Yes, normal. Utilize the help offered by your midwife in the 10 days or so aftercare.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	why does it matter that you are 15....? its totally normal for there to be dried blood. just be careful with her belly button and do what they told you at the Hospital while bathing/changing her.|`|LMc23g9Maa	Yes, keep it clean so it does not get infected.|`|NnWC1lxdaa	yes, its just her belly button healing. just make sure to keep it dry it will fall off soon. good luck|`|9DjIlS0zaa	don't ask people online. <br>  go to your doctor for medical advice|`|kFMFGciFaa	yes its normal. just take good care of it do not let water go in there, you can clean it with a damp cloth|`|1VMeKHojaa	Yes that's fine - completely natural.<br>  ...15? Ouch.|`|bRmAUPmkaa	yes,this is normal,its from the umbilical cord being cut off. keep it clean.|`|XcX73990aa	yeah im pretty sure its normal but if ur not sure u can always feel free to go to a doctor and ask.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Yes it is normal and it may puss...its fine!|`|fiUF4cAXaa	I think that is normal, this happened to my kids too.|`|UAJjnsBuaa	yeah i guess but be sure to get the rest out.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps <br>  always let her know you love her... 15?|`|84fm7wskaa	i think so

I think sex hurts more if you're not lubed up and turned on enough. I was pretty distracted. <br>  <br>  Afterwards, I walked a bit funny, but it didn't hurt too bad. Once you get that over with, sex is totally worth it. Just wait till you love someone.

4A8lGwYJaa	some victoria secret lotions or a purse or a day at a spa... or for my mom i'll fill a bag full of makeup and a couple of giftcards like to do her nails or for a haircut at her favorite hair salon. get her something that will make her feel good...|`|o65klEwWaa	How much money have you got to spend?|`|ZY6bu4qvaa	why is this question in the pregnancy category?|`|ZteoS74raa	A day at Spa...|`|VFTn5MVtaa	If you know your mom as much as it seems that you do, then the obvious answer will come to you on its own.  I will however tell you that most parents enjoy the company of their children on special occasions, so if you plan on getting her something make sure its something that you both can share or do together.  Take for example a spa treatment, you both can do it and relax at the same time, try giving her a gift card that she can use anywhere, ex.  Visa or Master Card Gift Card and go shopping together, that way she can get what she wants and you wont have to fear whether shes gonna like it or not!  Good luck!  Don't forget the cake!  Yummy! :-)

GMYk3dJ5aa	You are going to a traditional Hebrew rite of passage..... so shouldn't you dress like a traditional Hebrew?  <br>  <br>  Orthodox Judaism requires both men and women to substantially cover their bodies. In Haredi communities, men generally wear long pants and often long-sleeve shirts, and women wear blouses with sleeves below the elbow and skirts which cover the knees. Some women try not to follow the fashion, while others wear fashionable but modest clothing.<br>  <br>  In Modern Orthodox practice it is generally accepted for sleeves to reach the elbows and shirts to cover the collarbone, skirts to cover the knees with or without tights, and not wear pants in the presence of men. Socks are considered optional, based on the concept of minhag hamakom (custom of the community).<br>  <br>  Haredi women avoid skirts with slits, preferring instead kick-pleats. They also avoid overly eye-catching colors, especially bright red. Some insist on closed-toe shoes and always wear stockings, the thickness of which varies by community. In some Haredi communities women wear loose vests over shirts.<br>  <br>  ...... I'm just teasing you ........ ask some of your girl friends that are going or you mom.

aXnVFFUkaa	the first day of your last period is counted from there which is usually 2 weeks before you have conceived thats why is confusing so by the time you miss a period you are counted as 4 weeks pregnant|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Im kinda confused at what your saying but let me attempt to reword it...<br>  <br>  Okay they measure pregnancy from the first day of your last period... <br>  <br>  Really you don't "conceive" until about 2 weeks after this.<br>  <br>  So you would be considered 7 weeks pregnant when your baby is really only 5 weeks along.<br>  <br>  Its just much easier to calculate from your period than from when you conceive.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped?? <br>   =D|`|jCvdW3WGaa	Yeah, my dates said i was 12 weeks, but the ultrasound came back saying i was only 9 weeks.

LDiBjNf5aa	Birth control, don't use condoms at all. It's worked for a year and a half, caused no weight gain (but made my boobs grow, GRRR), and had me bleeding my entire first mont on it because I had a day one start. But after that, it's been perfect. And no babies!|`|XcX73990aa	birth control causes some women to gain weight while others dont.<br>  it just probably depends on the person.<br>  <br>  use condoms every time, to avoid STD's and pregnancies.<br>  i would try avoiding used the shots as a source of not getting pregnant.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	I used the patch!!

It has no hormones in it and I dont have to worry about taking a pill or inserting a ring. I will NEVER go back to a hormone birth control again. The only hormones that will be in my body are the ones I make on my own.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I used birth control pills while married and trying to prevent pregnancy, and birth control pills plus condoms before I was married. I gained a little weight, only a few pounds but mainly just in my breasts.|`|puCOYwMmaa	I did take bc pills but I ended up getting high blood pressure as a side effect so I went off of them.  After that my husband and I used condoms.  We used condoms for years and never had a pregnancy scare.<br>  <br>  Condoms work well as long as you use them right which means using them EVERY time you have sex and putting one on BEFORE his penis gets near your vagina.  Plus they're the only thing that protects against stds.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	try the mirena, its placed in your uterus and can stay there for 5 years, i hear it works great with little to no side effects and can be taken out whenever you want, and its easier than tryin to remember the pill or deal with weight gain. good luck!|`|pIBOSkfsaa	i use a contraceptive film or foam, and condoms. I found the pill messed me up too much.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	not for me i use low overal and lost 40 lbs lol
cYRZpGkqaa	I would suggest putting him back in a diaper for a while.|`|J4W68owgaa	It's completely normal for him to play with himself, kids do that. I would sit him down and explain to him that it makes some people uncomfortable and he needs to go in his room if he wants to do that. Don't punish him, you'll just make him feel ashamed, and he shouldn't be ashamed, he's learning about his body.     As for the poop, put a diaper on him backwards. Explain to him that playing with poop will make him sick and that for right now, you need to keep him safe and healthy. Tell him in a week you will try pull-ups again, but if he plays with his poop, he'll have to wear a diaper again.|`|av8aKGvqaa	You're child is only 2 years old so playin with himself come s naturally to him until the age of around 5. There isn't really anything you can do to stop him from doin this and there is nothin to worry about. IF you are worried about him playin gwith his excrement then try using a differnet pull up or potty training him. Discipline him when he does something naughty if you are against it, however children are inqquisitive and very curious so these things will come naturally to them. He cannot get any onfections from his excrement, it is only what he has eaten but not so good looking! Good Luck!!!|`|A9oStYsCaa	its perfectly normal for that age group. just try getting down to his level and explaining that it's a no no, and explain why we dont do that. Put him in time out in a corner when he does it.|`|FxXaBd16aa	I agree with the person who first answered this question. I think your son needs to be in a diapers for a little while again.(for playing with the poop thing)     With him playing with himself.. that is natural and it is expected. clothes feel different to them when they aren't wearing a diaper. And this causes them to rub it. They will grow out of it.. just nicely remind them that this isn't something that they do in front of others. They will grow out of it. My oldest did it ALOT! He grew out of it at 3/3.5.     Good Luck|`|SgOVFseaaa	Please don't try to stop him.  Simply teach him that there is a time and place for that.    Obviously playing with his poo is a different story.  He should be told it is not clean and punished if he continues.
p7ZdohGTaa	Three-year-olds can react to things in unexpected ways. Sometimes they grow out of these phases. Sometimes they do not. At three, a child is pretty immature in the development. An ADHD child often does get more frustrated with their situation than another child might. They may react with more expression than someone else, or with less control. If you have a question about how your child is reacting to the things you are describing, you might be best to consult with your pediatrician. One question might be whether your child always does this? In disciplining any child, a parent needs to try to be patient and keep control of their own emotions. Children often react to tension. The best thing to do is talk to the child's doctor. Consider taking a Step Parenting class. Remove all sugar and as much wheat from the child's diet as you can, and also remove peanut products including things with peanut oil in them. Some children react to dairy, too. Give your child lots of love and hugs. Try reading: "Allergies and the Hyperactive Child", by Dr. Doris Rapp (online booksites, used). But ask the pediatrician his opinion regarding how your child is reacting, in addition to the other things.
tkVCjeqmaa	One/Both of your parents have a brown eyed recessive gene and that's the one you inherited.     You don't have to have the same as them|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	its called recessive genes- both your parents must carry a gene for brown eyes and in you they both showed up!  i know a family where both the parents have brown eyes and darker skin and they have 6 children and the middle one has blue green eyes and light features-that is the neat thing about children, you never know what they may look like!|`|hUYaaXBvaa	blue is recessive, brown is dominant  if any if your ancestors on both sides have brown thats where you got it from  they carry a brown dominant gene even if they inherited the blue recessive  chances are they both carry the dominant gene  it does not need to show up in your parents, they are merely the carriers|`|AA10628838	Recessive genes.|`|qXaFET6Qaa	yup. brown is the most dominant gene of all eye colors. most likely there r a few people in for family that has it....it only takes one =]|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	The standard genetic matrix would mean this:         b  |  b  --------------  b | bb | bb    b | bb | bb    Meaning that if both your parents have blue eyes then all their offspring will have blue eyes.  So either they're wearing corrective colored lenses or one (or both) is not your biological parent.    Of course there are rare instances of mutated genes not following the standard dominant/recessive guidelines, but not very likely.    For those posters above who said that your parents must have a brown eyed recessive gene, ignore them.  Brown eyes are a dominant trait, blue is recessive.  If your parents were carriers of the brown eyed trait, they would have brown eyes.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Some of your answers you are getting aren't correct.  The gene for blue eyes is recessive and the gene for brown eyes is dominant, which means that in order to have blue eyes, like your parents, you have to have gotten TWO recessive genes for blue eyes.  If even one gene is a dominant gene, then you will have that eye color.  Two blue eyed people can not have a brown eyed kid, but, two brown eyed people can have a blue eyed kid, and one brown eyed parent and one blue eyed parent can have either a brown or blue eyed kid.  So something isn't matching up.  Are you sure that they are both your biological parents?      OK- I did a little research and found this article- I guess that what we were taught was not 100% correct- according to this two blue eyed parents CAN have a brown eyed child.  So Sorry!      http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/a...|`|XD7BFJUGaa	it is likely your one of your grandparents eye color!!! Best answer please??|`|eSwACpEhaa	Are you sure they are your parents???|`|8PmgWto5aa	If they both have brunette hair then that could be why and the color of their skin and your racial background. But you never know what genes will become of.|`|Vmim6dv0aa	Your brown eyes could come from anywhere in the family.  Look for other features on your parents that are similar or pesonality traits.  If you are still concerned talk to your mother about it.|`|alAtUXvyaa	brown eyes are ALWAYS dominant over blue ones, it is very very very VERY rare for two blue-eyed parents to have a kid with brown eyes..... are you adopted, maybe?|`|EJ9aEaOpaa	Maybe someone else in your family had brown eyes. heck in my family me and my two sisters have different colored eyes then our parents.|`|gmaCvh00aa	It's not possible.  One or both is not your biological parent.  I'm not being mean.  Two brown-eyed parents can have a blue-eyed child, but not the other way around.      EDIT:  Unless the USA Today article posted above me is correct!|`|UzGGflRfaa	Uh your not their child.......LOL just kidding. Both my children have a Black Father, Yet both of them have blond  hair and blue eyes. Too funny right? I am brown haired my self. And my mom is hawaiian....so somebody some where has these traits in our family, that just skipped I suppose.|`|7R9NSTx5aa	As far as I know, brown eyes are always dominant over blue eyes.  For you to have brown eyes, one of your parents would have to have them as well, and one of the brown-eyed parent's parents as well, and so forth.    Since both your parents have blue eyes, they both carry only the recessive trait, and since recessive + recessive = recessive, all their offspring should have blue eyes too. That said, there's a very high probability that one of them (or maybe even both) is not your biological parent. Or you may have a condition such as aniridia, or maybe one or more mutated genes that are responsible for your eye colour.
QnJvJ67uaa	I don't know if this will help but my eldest (9) has a short temper and is highly sensitive..I bought him a relaxation and meditation CD (Indigo dreams & Indigo Ocean dreams) , it weaves breathing techniques and visualisation into stories....it may be a little young for your brother (age range 4-9 or beginner children and the other one is 6-12) but it might help calm him ..it really helped my son..I think it helped him sleep better and become calmer in the day. You can google Indigo dreams for an overview of the cd .  Good luck :)|`|pXeskVZwaa	Medication is not the answer unless its life or death. It seems like you need to find a good therapist or talk with him.
10r8cXezaa	I didn't get mine until I gave birth.    Here is more info from babycenter.com    Even before you give birth, your milk is already "in." The colostrum you've produced since you were about four months pregnant is milk. However, we generally refer to the surge in milk volume and the change in composition as the milk "coming in." In the normal course of events, your milk will change and increase in volume even if you don't breastfeed your baby. When the placenta is delivered, the hormone that causes milk production (prolactin) goes to work. So whether or not you put your baby to your breast, your body will make milk.    If you're a first-time mom, you'll probably notice your milk increasing about three to four days postpartum, with your breasts getting fuller, firmer, and heavier. If you've had a very difficult delivery, or if you notice a lot of extra swelling (edema) in your body after a prolonged induction with an epidural, you may find that it takes a day or two more for the milk volume to increase. With your second or later babies, you're likely to notice it a bit earlier, at around two to three days. These time frames are averages  some moms have milk earlier, some later. Your baby is getting colostrum from the start, though, so don't worry that he has nothing to eat!    It's very important to breastfeed your baby early and often  starting in the birthing room. That's because early, frequent, and effective nursing increases prolactin activity in the breast, which helps assure an abundant and robust milk supply. The more often you feed your baby in the first 48 to 72 hours, the better your milk supply will be.|`|weE5FxCfaa	yes, especially if this is your first baby.  you will probably not get milk until right before it is born or even until it is born.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I never had milk secretion up until four days after my son was born. I don't know that you are supposed to because the baby is supposed to get the colostrum before your milk even comes in. Talk to your doctor about it. I'm sure a medical stand point will help you to understand it more.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Some women can hand express colostrum, many can not.  Colostrum is very thick, and even after birth there isn't much of it.  Before birth there are hormones produced by the placenta that inhibit production, cause the body to break it down faster, and inhibit let down.    Some women can never express or pump a drop of milk the whole time they breastfeed and still manage to have fat breastfed babies.  Pumping/expressing is a skill, you have to learn it, and not everyone can.    However, that being said, if you have PCOS and you aren't on medication for it you should consider it because PCOS can inhibit the normal development of the milk making system during puberty and during pregnancy|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	your milk doesn't actually come in until a few days after the baby is born. first you get whats called colostrum, its is yellowish in color and there isn't very much of it. This is what the baby gets first off, it helps them push their first bowel movement. Then your milk will come in and believe me you will know. I was dripping milk everywhere, get breast pads!! :)|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Yes I did not get my milk till about 1 week after birth.  Get a breast pump as well.  My son was born with very bad jaundince so I had to have him on formula and my milk dried up.  But if I had a breast pump then I could of pumped while he was on formula then switched to breast.      My story|`|SqTPbWvpaa	since that all bodies are different- you might be getting your (milk) after the baby is born.    then there is also a possibility that you may not get it- i have heard that from alot of my friends, not gettin any milk.    best of luck to you|`|bHAlwhTBaa	No worries.  I didnt have any secretion either, and I am still nursing my nine-month-old.  Everyone is different.  Good luck.|`|AykczQleaa	Trust me, you'll know! Your breasts will blow up like balloons and get rock hard and hurt like he double hockey sticks!|`|DDIBEvUTaa	after baby is born. you'll have clear/yellow colostrum at first & not much of it- but newborn's belly is only the size of a marble. w/frequent nursing milk will come in 2-3 days
RNZaUdxSaa	I went through something similar.. I ended up having a miscarriage and it tore us apart.. I had major depression after I lost the baby plus we split up right after that.. Finally 3 months he came around.. Since its only been a week.. If I were you I would tell him exactly how you feel.. (its dumb and you want to work it out) and leave it at that.. It may take him a few weeks to realize what he wants but with a baby in the picture he would be dumb just to end it there.. SO just remember time heals all.. and keep your head up that baby knows when your upset!! and also for you son! I realized after my husband went into the services that it was so dumb for us to fight (we fought everyday over the dumbest things) but we realized its so stupid and pointless.. and our time together was vaulable.. cause you dont know what you have till its gone so just remember that if you guys do get back together!! best of luck girl!!|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	how about you grow up and deal with life.|`|KEUuLH3zaa	Im a man and not at all familiar with those types of problems but I think finding something productive to do would help take your mind off things that are bothering you. Find something constructive that you can pour all that emotional energy into. And talk to your father, just being able to express your emotions to someone can help get stuff off your mind, but yea dont sit around thinking about it, find something to do.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	"...We've broken up plenty of times b4..."      Why then would you ever consider a baby? Did you think it would make the relationship better.|`|mcqO9Hgxaa	maybe you should talk to a best friend about this. but you shouldnt feel all alone, you have a 2 year old that should take up most of your time and thoughts and being pregnant ( even if you and your boyfriend art together ) you should feel very blessed. theyer are many people out in the world that want to be pregnant and have children, but cant. i know things are hard and rough now, but focus your energy and time on your son, and soon enough things will start looking up for you :-)  take care and i hope everything works out|`|6sAbs2iiaa	First thing you have to think is of yourself and the baby in your tummy that's first priority cause stress is not good for your baby then you have to be strong even if it's hard be strong it's not good for your son to see you like this . I know you want to be a family and the guy is being an asshole here is what I suggest try to talk to him one last time without getting angry and if he still acts like he doesn't care then walk away from him cause he's a kid himself ,I promise you the day is gonna come he will regret it very hard and it will be his big lost but crying won't fix anything will just make things more difficult please keep in mind these kids needs you so be stong for them and trust me with time everything will arrange. If you feel like talking to someone then just contact me.|`|14Mxe74Uaa	Maybe you should get you crap together and stop getting pregnant by people that you shouldn't be getting knocked up by.  Just because you are dating someone doesn't mean that you need to have a kid together.  By the way, why don't you have your own place?  If you have your own child you need to be supporting that child yourself and not living with your parents.  Its people like you that are the reason why there are so many screwed up kids in society anymore.  Its kinda messed up when you hear my baby's dad/mom more than my husband/wife, or at least boyfriend/girlfriend.  You obviously can't support the kid you do have right now why you would bring another one into the world is besides me.  I guess I do understand in a way because no matter how many kids you have and how many fathers there are, you have all sorts of government assistence out there for you including food stamps, housing, and worst of all pell grants to go to school.  That pisses me off to no end becasue when I was in school I worked my *** off full-time in a steal warehouse while trying to take classes because I wasn't eligible for government aid simply because I didn't have a kid. Makes you wonder why the government promotes irresponsibility be awarding all this money to woman that have kids with people they shouldn't.  Bottomline there girl, get your crap together and quit having kids until you are able to support them and are with the person you are having kids with(and I mean longer than a few months).  If you can't feed them don't breed them.|`|x4dXLF8Raa	dont let it get to you.. next time keep ur legs closed :/  or use birthcontrol!!!|`|627pWyVkaa	See a counselor talk to them, and go to your doctor and get on an anti depressant, and worry about yourself no one else you have to make sure you stay healthy for you and your baby.    If youve broken up several times, leave it be. Have him in your childs life not yours- you need to worry about yourself and your baby not your ex.|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	I was having depression through out my pregnancy and had the same question best answer I received ,this too shall pass.|`|JZnRxPUCaa	Well, I would say you  need a support system. Family or friends that you are really close to. Just tell them how you are feeling, and anyone who loves you should be more than willing to make sure you get out of this slump!  Just try to spend time doing things you like to do, or things that your son really enjoys. Just be careful because it is important that you stay healthy, (even emotionally) for the sake of that precious baby growing inside you :)|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	The funny thing is when we have a break up we only tend to remember all the good stuff that we now miss but perhaps if you look at the relationship realistically and you will be able to remember all the bad stuff about him and about the relationship that you Absolutely will not miss. Maybe if you look at the reasons the relationship ended rather than focus on the things you will miss, you will be able to pull it together and work on moving on for you and your kids. IF the good out weighed the bad and it is meant to be then it will be, however if he is like most men and sees you are sitting around pining for him and unable to move on then he is not coming back any time soon. Focus on being healthy, find things to occupy your time, do things you enjoy doing and take it one day at a time. Fake it every day and one day you will find you don't have to fake it bc you are really okay. IF he isn't the right one and you waste your time trying to make it work, then when the right man does come along you won't know or be available. Everyone deserves to be with the person who makes them happy and who brings out the best in them. IF he doesn't  do this for you and you for him then don't be scared of change, stop romanticizing the relationship and move on.|`|5d92d4d47a0206e6c5d7d342e7d48e8eaa	As someone else pointed out, when you say "Weve broken up plenty of times"... this is a bad sign to begin with. This proves that he wasn't really ready to deal with having a serious relationship in the first place if he was off-and-on all of the time. A real man, sticks with you, through thick and thin. For better, or worse. A real man doesn't run off at the first sign of trouble and then come back after the dust settles. MOVE ON. There are far better, stronger men out there, who will treat you (and your baby) with the respect you rightly deserve.... And yes, it is painful, losing someone whom you thought was right for you. But spare yourself the pain. Try not to focus on him, but make up mind up that its over. And focus on taking care of your baby. She will need you. And until someone new comes along, try to be patient. Suffering, builds character :-)  Only makes you stronger.|`|rvviZvOSaa	Do you think that you really did everything you could to avoid the break up? In fact, deep inside, do you think you could ever be a true family, and support each other, and pass over your problems? If you really think so, do the best you can and try to make him see that too. But if he's the only problem and he can't pass over some issues, can't change that for you...it's better to be separated.  It's normal to be emotional, not because you're pregnant but because you made a decision and you're overcoming the problem. And go on, crying is ok, it helps you get off your feelings...but don't let your kid see you. Every time you look at him try to remember how much you love him and that he's the best kid in the world, because you're his mom and you'll teach him everything he needs to be the best man when he grows up! So focus on your kids...It's such a miracle and such a happiness to have kids..Just think about it!  Take it easy, girl. Don't complicate things. If you feel like suffering, let it go, stop blocking or you'll do worse. Analyze everything that happened, try to be objective and find the answers. Trust yourself, your intuition knows the best! And try to find again things that you like doing...reading, gardening, walking in the park and watching your son playing...small things which might make you smile. Head up, time passes by so rapidly and you lose it if you're not enjoying your life! Tomorrow you'll see your kid a teenage and you'll wonder when did it happen...|`|gD6MynLdaa	Hi and congrats on your pregnancy.  You don't want to worry yourself too much about his.  It is not good for you or the baby.    Try spending more time with your son.  Hopefully that will get your mind off of things.  This guy you talk about doesn't seem worth the bother, seeing as you are pregnant, and he has hurt you this bad.     There are plenty of good men out there that are willing to be a father figure to women who already have children.  You will find someone better.  Just be patient and think of your soon to be 2 children.     I hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|L5RAtkhPaa	Although I am not a girl.. I am a very emotional person. I have been in similar situations but on the other end as I am male.    It is hard.. it will hurt.. and for a good while. But here is what I can tell you so you can see there is always good with the bad.    You are strong. You will get over him and you will find someone that loves you better and that you should be with. Each time you get overcome with emotions just take 4-5 big deep breaths and tell yourself you are strong and can do it. Seriously.. telling yourself this programs your mind to believe it.    Don't sit at home.. go out walking with your son, take him to a park, pool, the mall etc. The more you go out.. the better you will feel. When at home, just cuddle and play with your boy and the days will pass fast.    Life is hard, but not that hard. It has its ups and downs and I find that with each up there is a down or we would not know what the up is. Just like the economy right now.. downs are usually steep and hurt bad, but the ups are bigger, last longer and always bring great reward.    So know that even thouggh this is a small down... great good will come from it and you will find that perfect person!    Hope this helps some. :)|`|loEiJ241aa	I dont really know what to do with the boyfriend thing since boys have no clue what they get from leaving a girl at a very hard time. But a way to relax is take a long hot bath with epsom salts. it relaxes muscles and listen to music you enjoy. Time might not heal everything this time saying if he is the father of your kid because you are going to be looking at ur babybump and relizing it and even after the baby has been born you will be reminded. talk to your kid and talk to your father. or any type of family member. but you have to stay strong call him and talk but ask him not to hang up but dont be nuts and constanly call because he wont answer. and once you do get to talk, tell him that you cant cope wihout him and if he says "so" just be like you werent worth the time but if he says i miss you too then ask him to come over. and that is the most i can say.
CPYOfG9Haa	you can be pregnant and get your period my best friend in college got hers for about five months into her preganacy she didnt know until she was 2months pregnant either and went to the doctor and he said for some women they can have their period while being pregnant if they release 2 eggs instead of one every month so just to be sure hun go get a test and check :) good luck|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Could be subchorionic bleeding instead.  I remember researching all of this when I thought I MAY have been pregnant as well.  I'm sure this information would interest you.      Pregnancy Complications    Complications: Subchorionic Bleeding  Sometimes, blood clots form within the layers of the placenta. But more often than not, they heal themselves.  What it is: Also called subchorionic hematoma, subchorionic bleeding is the accumulation of blood within the folds of the chorion (the outer fetal membrane, next to the placenta) or within the layers of the placenta itself. These bleeds, or clots, can cause the placenta to separate from the uterine wall if they get too large, if they develop in a bad spot, or if they arent eventually reabsorbed.     How common is it? A good 20 percent of pregnant women will experience some kind of bleeding early in pregnancy, though its often hard to tell whats causing the problem. Subchorionic hematomas are even harder to pick up because they dont always result in noticeable spotting or bleeding, especially when theyre small.|`|KozoNqpsaa	It's possible to be bleeding and still be pregnant. If you want more info on decidual bleeding, try googling it. Also, you don't technically get your period while pregnant. Some women will swear they did but it's actually not your period. There are many reasons for bleeding during all trimesters, some are even unexplained and it should always be discussed with your doctor.    Hope this helps, good luck!|`|FCcbgriuaa	You still could be but it all depends on you menstrual cycle. Look at this web site it might help you answer a lot of questions. Good luck and lots of baby dust!!
D35xKICoaa	May be your personal doc can tell you why.

If the outfit is a problem do not use it or get extensions.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	Soap them. Rub a bar of soap on them then wash. That should help loosen. They also seem to loosen up after you use them a few times.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Hold on close to the snap when pulling apart.  Use seems to loosen them as well.  I had some outfits with the hardest snaps, and after a few usages, they were easier.  If they continue to be a pain, use the outfits sparingly.    Beeswax on the snap will work as well.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	You know it is possible she is suffering from some form of depression, like post-partum depression, she may need some professional help and that is nothing to be ashamed of. I am 34 weeks pregnant and I was just put on antidepressants by my midwife because I was having some problems which in turn was causing problems in my relationship. Good luck.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Wow you are not married. You are two people living in the same house - roommates. Now honestly i don't think she has a depression i think she's just a *****. She's treating you like dirt. Sorry but if her psychologist thought she was depressed he would've given her meds. ( i dunno did he?)  She doesn't seem to be moody either since she's bitchy all day.   So seriously if you really  wanna make this work ( meaning dont just make it work because of the kid, it will suffer more if it has two parents who live together but hate eachother then two parents who dont live together but at least there's harmony) you will need to give her an ultimatum. She goes to counceling for her hmmm not even sure what to call this and/or you both go to marriage counseling. Not sure if this will work cuz it doesnt sound like it a marriage problem , the problem is the way she's acting.  Tell if she doen't change or get help, then you will leave. Tell her this is supposed to be a family, which means you do stuff together and you share your load of household work!  No, seriously. And you must leave if she refuses cuz this will destroy you , it already is.  And well if the counseling doesn't work and it turns out she really is just a bad person, well then at least you know you've tried everything to make it work. But in the end, it takes two.  Also , have your child in mind, do you really wnat him to grow up thinking this is what marriage is like?|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Postpartum depression you can get this during and after pregnancy she really should be seeing her doctor...she actually sounds like my mom...I am 24 so I think my mom is excluded from the postpartum part but depression is probably a big factor if you two don't want to be miserable your whole life and make your kid miserable get her some help...|`|nHpd4lRXaa	I would either look into sending her to a counsellor or look into going to marriage counselling for the both of you.|`|iMULlxdgaa	ahhhh..she needs to see a couselor or something liek that,  she may be suffering from postpardum depression.  Irritabilty is a sign of depression.  I would sit down with her (maybe go on a date, get a nice bottle of wine or something like that,  or if you guys don't drink how about a coffee? leave the baby with soeone for a few hours and havea chat about your future together in a realxed environment, not in front of the kid)  I also would suggest you mention that maybe she should talk to her doctor about postpardum depression because your afraid she may be suffering from it and you care a lot about her and you don't want to see her sad because you want a happy family life with her.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	That's enough to make any man nuts... all i can say is hang in there... See if she won't see her doctor... many women after pregnancy get PP depression and that can last months, even years and is becoming more and more common... I can only imagine the backlash you will get for suggesting such a thing, but maybe she needs to hear it from a DR... depression meds MAY help... get to a DR... Good luck buddy!|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	You can come to my house...|`|E5CnUdhsaa	sounds liek a case of out stretched baby blues....you can suffer this before baby comes and it progresses id speak to a doc on how to approach this or if your UK...your babys health visitor|`|bTbugHyaaa	Yikes you sound like my boyfriend. I feel as though sometimes I might do the same thing to him but not as bad. I will tell u what would keep me on my toes. The next time she said she was leaving let her *** go. Trust me when I tell u she will be back. Also why do u do ur laundry seperate? My boyfriend does most of the chores, and I cook and grocery shop, and I feel as though it is an even trade. Also if i were you i would take a nite out with the fellows. It may sounds bad but seem less interested and slack off on some chores so she can see what you really do. Or next time she says she is leaving tell her don't bother I will leave. She will be like WHAT..|`|AA10145416	she needs professional help, sometimes there are problems that affects us alot and we expect people to understand but there is no way to say it, only a professional can get to the bottom of it and help out|`|87WOSjwgaa	I would say she has postpartum depression bad. I would try to get her into a doctor ASAP and make sure you go with her. That way you can relate to the doctor how she acts and she will feel like you are helping her. Explain to her that you are worried about her well being. Dont make it about you, make it about her. She might be more accepting of this. Try to be supportive of her going to doctor and possibly taking meds. Hang in there, hopefully she will go and things will improve!|`|6cCWUf9xaa	From what I read, your wife needs probably some kind of counseling for her outbursts. If you both go to counseling make sure you have it written down on paper and give this to the person doing the interviewing. This person may request she see a shrink or enter a program for her tantrums. Also go see a lawyer and see what can be done. This is not normal behavior for anyone to witness, especially if your son is around when she goes off like this.|`|T9gaHu1kaa	wow.. you seem like a really great man and any woman who treated you like that has to be nuts! haha..    I agree with the other posts she needs to get help and stick with it. Or else she will be like this forever. If you really love her, which obviously you do I would just suggest helping her.. making her stick to seeing a counselor. I think she has the baby blues as well..|`|phwivaqNaa	Her hormones are clearly out of whack at 3 months.  I agree with the other posts.  She may have a form of depression or other medical condition that warrants medication.  It is important to take care of it now because it could lead to post partum depression.    You are doing everything you can.  Just try to bite your tongue because arguing back will only make it worse.  I would call her doctor and discuss your concerns of depression and see what he/she suggestions.  I would do this first before approaching her because she is irrational and could deny it.  Keep in mind hormones are suppose to balance a little in the 2nd trimester and return in the 3rd.  So, it could be a false if she starts to seem better.  Keep a close eye on her for her's and the baby's safety.|`|8hYKIRWiaa	sounds like a clear case of depression (baby blues)  I would try to get her to the dr to be evualuated.|`|XtEGXLKnaa	Maybe she is depressed or overwhelmed. Everyone is different but, I'm 5 months pregnant and I am very sensitive not moody or anything just easy to cry over nothing. Have you tried talking to her and seeing what's wrong? Maybe she should see someone. Or maybe if see talks about how she feels she'll feel better.|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	Maybe she's having the baby blues and you need to stop making her feel bad for what she's not doing ,it sounds like you do things just to make yourself feel like your a better person then your wife. you married her for love and if you cant love her through better or worst you need to find out what the real meaning of marriage is ,its not always perfect. cherish her for all the good she does|`|DTg3USppaa	She wasn't this way before having the baby? It sounds like she is just having a hard time dealing with the fact she has a baby, a husband and she doesn't know exactly what to do with all of the emotions. You should just take your son to a babysitter for a night and take her out to eat and a great show/movie/anything fun and sexy! Make her feel beautiful again. She might be crying out for help in her crazy moody way!! She shouldn't threaten to leave or  take your baby from you though :( See if a great night out without the baby will relax her and possibly relax you! Both being new parents, you need your time alone.|`|tGik2gx1aa	she sounds mean..i mean i was all ready to say YOU TRY BEING PREGNANT FOR 9 MONTHS but now i see that she is being unreasonable.  but to be fair it is a bit like man and woman switching roles..i mean only a few years ago it would have been the same story exept it would be switched around..but it wouldent just be in your house oh no it would be in every house in the western world..  but anyway times have changed and you dont have to put up with it..|`|wNrCK4FDaa	You seems to be a very good man to me. I want to say if she's not like that before the baby then she might need some evaluations by the doctor.

Someone told me if you're really sick in the beginning it's a girl because of all the extra hormones.  I'm 17 weeks and I'm trying to guess too!|`|JZnRxPUCaa	On the chinese gender calendar- it was fun- and right for me.  Heart beat being high is a girl  Orange juice cravings = girl  Feel less pretty while you are pregnant = girl  Also the color of your urine, bright yellow= girl   dull light urine = boy  I had a lot of gender quizzes like at babycenter.com, and babyzone.com, and my end results said girl, how these things can predict the gender of a baby is beyond me and completely silly, but it is fun just for giggles!  Just remember none of them are an exact science, but the happened to be true for me.  Congrats and good luck on finding the gender!|`|uzCaG1ayaa	I can't really say for sure since I am pregnant for the third time but the first set was a boy and a girl, however when I was pregnant with my daughter I put on wait everywhere. This time round I am huge although I'm only ten weeks pregnant but its a neat bump. All my friends are saying thats what happened when they had a boy. I don't really believe that though and other than that there aren't any 'Clues' to what your having. Congratulations..x    Also, I wouldn't trust the chinese gender calendar because it told me I was expecting a boy until at 21 weeks it turned out I was having a girl.

Gosh.|`|M2yERqNSaa	youre giving it attention just by writing this question|`|7ee80ac8606af76cab55c3608e92fedeaa	the same reason why we read tabloids on Britney Spears..|`|xIowgWL7aa	Its the sort of story that even if you claim you are not interested in, you feel compelled to listen and learn more. First of all, the woman has 14 kids, which in itself is not common. And then when you see her on television, it hits home what a loony this woman really is. At least with other parents of mega multiples, they seem more, well, down to earth and realistic about the future and there are also two parents involved. This one just seems like the heavens will provide and everything will be just fine and dandy.<br>  <br>  I would love to see her ignored and forgotten but I worry about those poor kids being raised by a mother who seems to have this Angelina Jolie fixation (right down to the lips) and thinks that no matter what she says, it makes sense, when it really doesn't and all this conflicting information is coming out.<br>  <br>  She is almost finished with her 15 minutes of fame and will recede into the woodwork until something happens which brings her back into our collective consciousness.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Because people like YOU keep asking questions about her!!!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I agree, I think she wants media attention (and money from it, then again how else will she look after the kids?) so it's best to just ignore her.<br>  <br>  But who can't help having a quick discussion about important news stories? The media keeps reporting it so people keep seeing it and most people like to give their opinion on current events...that's just how people are.<br>  <br>  Harriet
QCUPeW8aaa	At 6 1/2 weeks pregnant its hard to determine what they should see.<br>  A baby is the size of a grain of rice at this point and there's a chance you'd see a baby but not likely.<br>  its probably just way to soon especially if you have not had any bleeding.<br>  Good luck to you!|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I went in for an ultrasound at exactly that same time because my morning sickness ended suddenly and scared me.  We did see a LITTLE something.  The doctor called it a "fetal pole" (?).  There was a heartbeat which was barely visible.  It's important to note that the office I visited had upgraded their ultrasound technology within the past couple of years.  I bet that makes a difference.  Also, it could just be too early like you said.  There are blood tests they can do on you to find out if your hormones (hcg) are rising at an appropriate level.  If you just can't relax about it, I'd ask them to do that.  They offered it to me, saying they would test twice a couple of days apart to see if everything was okay.  I didn't do it because I had the ultrasound--I was a total basket case, worrying and crying, so I needed it.  But my doctor did say that he wasn't at all sure we'd be able to see anything.  We were just lucky.<br>  <br>  I really hope your baby is okay, and that you can find out soon!  Good luck.|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	Sometimes trying to conceive will throw your period off, because it is a stressful and anxious feeling.  You can normally see the baby at 6 weeks.  My first baby's ultrasound was at 6 weeks too.  I really think you may be earlier than 6 weeks though.  If you have no spotting or cramping, I would not worry about it so much.|`|nVeZzuFvaa	I am really sorry that this is happening, I know you must be so stressed out right now. The best advice I can give it to just listen to your doctor. Did they say when they would see you again? If they didnt give your the prognosis of a miscarriage right away, then he/she might just be hiding! Maybe you should try another Dr, or just wait until your next appt. If you havent bled, or been having really bad cramps, there is a good chance that you havent had a miscarriage. Good luck and I hope everything works out for you!!|`|naMZy80Eaa	I too had the same experience, I was 6 weeks preg and was having really bad cramps and light bleeding. They did some blood tests and did a vaginal ultrasound and couldn't see nothing. So they told me to come back in the am and do another blood test, to check the hgc levels, or whatever the levels are that they check. If the numbers doubled it was still a good pregnancy, but if they dropped it meant that the baby wouldn't make it. Turns out I was having a miscarriage and had to have a d&c. This might not be the case for you, but you should have blood work done that will tell you a lot. Hope this helps and good luck.|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	Your dates are probably off! If nothing showed on the ultrasound your probably like 3-4 weeks. The first sign of pregnancy on a ultrasound is a gestational sac it looks like a black dot. That usually appears when your hcg level has reached 1500. 9 times out of 10 you ovulated late. all women are not the same and all babies are not the same. Put your faith in God and say a little prayer to ease your mind and everything will work out just fine!|`|Ztzck2dBaa	well they should be able to tell but you don't want to stess about the situations becuz stressin and worrying plays a big part in causing women to miscarry . in my opinion go get a second opinion an go to another doctor to see wat he think.|`|ERwOVoVEaa	you should go to another doctor and get a second opion|`|96HWpdkFaa	You could be earlier then you thought and that could be the reason. Go back in a week or two.<br>  <br>  I had my first ultrasound at 7 weeks and saw the baby clear in vaginal ultrasound!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|AA11763588	I told you to stop stressing out. You aren't helping your situation.<br>  <br>  You need to call your DR and ask for a QUANT blood test to see where your HcG levels are to determine if they are where they are supposed to be.<br>  <br>  Your baby is the size of an M & M right now. Even on a transvaginal US it is very difficult to see at 6 weeks. This is why MOST DR's wait till you are between 8 - 10 weeks to do one of these types of US.<br>  <br>  Miscarriages can and do happen during these first few weeks.

While women with this disorder don't necessarily "hate" their children, they behave in such a way as to make the child sick/seem sick to get attention for themselves.  With MbPS, to an onlooker who doesn't fully understand this, it could seem as though the mother doesn't love her child because of her jealousy of the attention the child is getting instead of her.|`|AA10452945	if you know somebody with PPD, I'd seriously consider getting them some help, or referring them to a support group|`|igI5yX0vaa	It is a symptom of post-partum depression.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	post pardum depression. but women with PPD dont always hate their babies.

kpnSKV6Eaa	have known many people to have smoked throughout entire preganancies and kids had no birth defects.. also a best friend has had four kids, smoked with 3 of them and not with one.. there are no differences in behavior or learning ability with any of them. they are perfectly normal.. <br>  <br>  i can tell you though that if she is going to smoke then she needs to smoke from a small bubbler or pipe only because the joint she is smoking has paper in it. obviously.. that is the harmful part.. with a pipe or bubler you are only getting the weed. the paper from the joint is the same as paper from ciggarettes could be harmful..<br>  <br>  i also smoked through my pregnancy and my doc says my baby is healthy and growing normally.. also that brain function is all normal.<br>  probably will get a lot of thumbs down for this but what the hell do they know.. they have probably never smoked in there life.<br>  <br>  also do not smoke blunts either. they have nicotine in them.. you are right though.. weed is not as bad as ciggarettes..<br>  <br>   i would tell her to slow down a bit towards the end of pregnancy about every other day instead of everyday just because when you are high the effects of labor are not as strong... you could be farther along in labor than your body is actually letting on. weed helps pain so just slow down a bit at the end and all will be well<br>  <br>  as for breastfeeding not too sure on that yet cuz i havent done it yet<br>  <br>  <br>  oh yeah and also babies that are exposed to weed in the womb seem to be way less cranky and cry less.. more laid back and happy|`|96HWpdkFaa	This is horrible...when your pregnant if theres even a slight CHANCE that something is bad for the baby there is no way you should do it. That is NOT being a good parent at all!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	You know they test for that when you have your baby? They test the blood from the placenta and that will show any drug use in the past 4 months. Also, smoking cigarettes has more chemicals. I won't argue that but how do you know the joint is unlaced? People spray stuff on weed to make the smell less detectible and they also put stuff in there to make it addictive. Marijuana itself is not addictive, and if she goes through moodswings I highly doubt she's just smoking grass. A marijuana cigarette does the same damage to a placenta's oxygen and blood supply as a tabacco cigarette does. Thc doesn't necessarily pass to the placenta at a high rate, but she is still depriving her baby of necessary blood, oxygen and nutrients and that baby has no choice but to depend on her.|`|Gr78AFvyaa	it affects everybody differently so I don't think anybody can honestly say if her baby will be okay.<br>  I personally know plenty of people who have smoked through their entire pregnancy and had big healthy babies who developed at average or above pace with the rest of their age group...<br>  If I were her though I would stop smoking at around 33-34 weeks to make sure all the THC is out of her system because if they drug test her baby after its born she has the possibility for it to be taken away...|`|nXPJ6d7eaa	A friend of mine smoked throughout her pregnancy, and her daughter is perfectly normal, wonderful and healthy. She is five now.<br>  <br>  I did some research myself and found that a lot of women smoke it to get rid of morning sickness. Apparently, according to one woman, it was the only thing that helped her chronic morning sickness. She was vomiting many times a day, however, and losing weight, so I guess she kind of justified it that way.<br>  <br>  There is no conclusive study that I can find, only personal accounts on pages like i-am-pregnant.com. They have a section for it on there...|`|LSxBwiFSaa	The "Answers" to most of your Questions is, -"Who Knows?" -To which we can only Ask, "Does your Sister REALLY want to 'find out' ?!  If she can't lay off the weed until at LEAST after she's finished Breast Feeding, then whatever "happens"- she "Bought".    :0|`|oDGpmkMaaa	my step mother smoked through her whole pregnancy. My brother is fine now but he was born 2 months premature (which cloud have been do to other factors like mothers age) but anyway they did a drug test on her and she was positive. She wasn't aloud to see him for the First week of his life. Even if your sister still does it she needs to make sure that its out of her system before the birth. I would hate for her to go through what my step mom did.<br>  <br>  Personaly I would never smoke during a pregnacy. Just because I wouldn't want to take any risk at harming my baby.|`|AA10015577	I know someone who smoked for some of the second trimester and their child is very smart and is in the 95th percentile.  Doctors around here (I have been told) say that they would rather their patients smoke marijuana rather than a cigarette.  Plus she did a lot of research too.  I would get a professional opinion or look up some statistics.|`|9zMC6EBtaa	I hope they take her child away from her, it would serve her right for being so careless with her precious gift. Speaking as someone who had such trouble getting pregnant, I am appalled that she would do such a stupid thing. A child is a gift from heaven and should be given the best things. I wish someone would report her to the Department on Child and Family Services, than maybe she will understand the weight of her decisions.|`|kvCa4xCmaa	my sister in-law smoked a blunt or two every day and smoked cigarettes up to her third trimester. she smoked cigarettes the whole time. the cigarettes caused her to go into pre-term labor and she was contracting the last 3months of her pregnancy.. Just make sure your sister stops before the 3rd trimester because they will test the baby for drugs and is there are drugs in the system they will take her baby.. p.s. my niece came out perfectly fine! so screw people who say weed is bad!|`|dCLnLlsCaa	<a href="http://www.mothering.com/articles/pregnancy_birth/birth_preparation/marijuana-side4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothering.com/articles/pregna...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mothering.com/articles/pregnancy_birth/birth_preparation/marijuana.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothering.com/articles/pregna...</a><br>  <br>  Here are some great articles from mothering magazine about marijuana during pregnancy.  Personal opinion, better pot than cigarettes and alcohol.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	It won't matter when the hospital takes her baby away after it tests positive for marijuana. If they suspect drug use, they will test the baby.|`|sLERr3aAaa	Your sister is a idiot|`|812874d02f72331b1d1a4fa6424dc06daa	I am 29w2d pregnant with my first baby, and I have smoked throughout my entire pregnancy. I have severe morning sickness and nausea and nothing the doctor prescribed or recommended worked. Without smoking, I am not able to eat. My doctor also knows that I smoke and said that there are no proven cases in which marijuana has caused birth defects. He told me that if it helps me, then to do it. As long as the marijuana is not laced with any other type of drug, it is no worse than cigarettes. Cigarettes are still worse for your baby than marijuana is. I have smoked everyday of my pregnancy and only through pipes and bongs and my baby is progressing as he should be and there are no complications or signs of birth defects or anything. He looks like a normal little boy. However, your sister should stop smoking marijuana all together about a month and a half before her due date, only because some hospitals will drug test both the mother and the baby after birth. If there are any traces of drugs in either one of them, the department of children and families is contacted and her baby could be taken away. It is also true that THC is present in breast milk and will be transferred to her baby, whether she smokes an hour and a half before breast feeding or not. It will still be in her breast milk, just like it will still be in her blood and urine. Whereas alcohol will no longer be present in breast milk after an hour and a half, the THC will be and will still be transferred to the baby. So as long as she is breast feeding she should not be smoking.|`|veVzD5zjaa	this is absolutly ridiculous... as a pot smoker myself but I WOULD never put my babies life at risk smoking pot... you can't freaking breastfeed while smoking pot it takes more than an hour and a half to get out of your system... you and you sister are both retarded and need some serious help if you think smoking pot is AT ALL ok while you are carrying another human life in you!!!! Get real...|`|EFGKxSsVaa	HAHAHA, im sorry but this question is ridiculous.<br>  my friends mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with him, and hes fine for the most part i guess, haha<br>  <br>  I guess all in all, smoking anything and drinking any kind of alcohol isnt really something you should do and be proud of. :\|`|P7q9cNaiaa	My friend;s baby mama smoked cigs and pot while she was pregnant. I'm not sure about specifics but her placenta broke two weeks early, so she was induced. Her baby was actually really healthy despite being pretty small and she's a really good baby. It's too early to know about the more long-term effects or anything about asthma / educational / developmental problems.|`|dR2bqUixaa	My mother smoked weed while she was pregnant with me and my twin brother. We both came out fine. Also she breastfeed me and my brother. Her baby should be fine. O... My mother smoked at least 2 or 3 joints a day. Don't worry.|`|lwPbfbMEaa	well i see this as a type of child abuse. i was a smoker, pot smoker, drinker before i had my child and i gave it all up. does she not feel guilty? seriously get real!|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	my good friend smoked pot regularly throughout her pregnancy. i mean-i smoked with her at 6 months and idk if she smoked after that. she has a beautiful 3 month daughter. she's perfect. =)|`|HWsQoqt8aa	I know this woman and she smoked that then first few months because she had no idea that she was preg. then when she had the baby it did not make it through the night.|`|EOyujCyBaa	i read that smoking marijuana in pregnancy can cause physical deformaties in babies, everything physically is formed by 12 weeks so if she smoked heavily at that stage there could be a chance.. although i have known people who have done x and speed early in pregnancy (they didnt know at the time) and there babies were fine but thats not to say its okay to do it while pregnant.. also she will be cranky anyway its the hormones, i was like a b***h when i was pregnant lol i wouldnt reccomend breast feeding if shes going to smoke weed after the baby is born, you cant control when the baby will want another feed, some babies feed every 2 hours and it will pass into the babies system then... formula is just as good, they wouldnt sell it if it didnt have all a baby needs:)|`|I07nxTAxaa	i smoked threw my whole preg. and i ended up with a 9.3 oz baby who is a genius. already talking about a 25 word vocabulary he started holding his own bottle at two weeks started crawling at 4 1/2 months.<br>  I didn't smoke while breastfeeding though.<br>  But the thing about weed while pregnant is that when you put carbon dioxide (Smoke) in your system that it lowers your blood oxygen level.  A little bit isn't going to do anything.<br>  As for the state taking your kids for smokeing weed yeah isn't going to happen my friend works for cps. They don't even investigate weed cases, yes they do do a drug test on the baby when it is born if it is your first child or you have had other children who have came up positive, i don't know how far along she is but is wa they do a mandatory drug test between 21-26 weeks.

Plus Felicity is prettier as a given name than Elle.|`|88a2e933993f652ca67674dcbd1fceacaa	I think Elle probably works better as a first name, becuase you have to consider what Felicity would be shortened to. I personally can't think of anything that sounds right at all.|`|sA9zYafHaa	Felicity Elle. They're both very pretty, but I think a long name first, then a short middle name, sounds the best. Elle could always be a nickname, but Felicity is just so pretty!|`|UXxsDUECaa	Felicity Elle<br>  <br>  Beautiful names you picked :)|`|wfTCeGXQaa	I think that Felicity Elle sounds much prettier, and it sort of has a little rhythm to it. :D|`|cnIzqEoDaa	I think it depends on your last name.. <br>  I personally love both of the names and they work either way.|`|bYygntwzaa	elle felicity definitely sounds better.
dzqxQmpFaa	No, the married and same father for both helps enormously with that|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Take pride in the fact that you are married and your children are legitimate. If someone gives you trouble and you feel the need to justify yourself just say you look young for your age but your husband doesn't seem to mind it and walk off.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	as long as you are happy, in a good marriage, taking care of your kids great, then dont worry what others think.<br>  <br>  best of luck and congrats|`|suVispAAaa	No not at all, you are married & both children are by the same father. That is far from a hoe. A hoe is some one who is having children, each child is by a different father & they are not married, but you are nothing like that (from what you posted). Thanks for being faithful..not alot of people out there like that anymore..& thanks for being married before you had your children!!<br>  <br>  Wow though you are young, i could never imagine getting married & have a child @ almost18 years old!

Good thing you are married and faithful. If you love your husband and your daughter, that is all that counts. That doesn't make you look like a hoe. That is a person who sleeps with every man she dates. But you should have lived your life before getting married and starting a family.|`|Ym90xu59aa	Not a ho'. Just stupid|`|p8UOAGSEaa	no , you are married although you were young if you are taking care of your kids on your own with no help, then yeah go ahead and do your thing, besides your girl needs a sibling right? Do it while you are young because the older the less patience....lol... no really I think it is your life, live it the way it makes You HAPPY!  :)|`|Yz2TvEMlaa	you're in a committed relationship. I see nothing wrong with this. You started early by marrying early, it should be expected that you would have children earlier as well. Congrats and who cares what other people think.

It's really not anyone else's business.|`|14S2PmqEaa	Some people may say that.  But its how you feel about yourself that matters.

AA11783467	Think about how you felt during your first break up.<br>  Try to distract him from thinking about it. Go with him to do something crazy fun this weekend. Or just go rent a ridiculous movie, order pizza & chill. Just be there for him, basically. If he wants to talk, he'll talk, but don't let him stew.|`|SOveWKxkaa	Let him work it out, this is part of growing up. Give him a week and see if he can do this on his own. Don't say anything negative about his girlfriend, they may get back together. Just let him know that you are there for him if needed and that you love him. If it last more than a week he will eventually open up to you and at the same time respect you for allowing him his privacy. After a week and he is still not eating and is really emotional, step up and remind him that you would like to talk to him about it because it could be affecting his health.|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	ok, if he wants to be with her still, he is trying to figure out in his young mind, what could he have possibly done wrong.

6Knhikr1aa	I have had 3 kids. With the first two I got a random period at about that time too. I never had one again until they weaned, two years later! With this baby I haven't gotten one and he's 7 months. I think your body is just kind of resetting or something. But it's normal and it doesn't mean you will get your period back for real anytime soon. In fact I never ovulated at all through our entire nursing period, so My kids are all about 3 years apart ( 2years nursing, a few months of rest and then pregnant again! lol) I wouldn't have it any other way =-)|`|vue9NOhYaa	Are you breastfeeding? If so, you probably won't have a period for a while. (The bleed in mid-January was probably lochia, or a bit of bleeding that some women have at around 6 weeks.) <br>  <br>  If you aren't breastfeeding, you may still be a bit irregular for a while, so, if you've been using birth control (or not having sex) I wouldn't worry about it.|`|39qec43kaa	I am not breastfeeding, formula feeding and I have not had my period yet, and I also had my son in December.  My doctor told me that it just takes time for your body to readjust.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	You shouldnt be late unless your breast feeding.  You should be using protection if not on the pill to make certain you dont get pregnant again.  A friend breast fed and didnt get her period|`|sMlNvnxmaa	Well i breast feed my babies and i didnt have one so if u are breast feeding this maybe the case|`|VHgfWPS2aa	Could you be pregnant again?
QCUPeW8aaa	That's definately a miscarriage the tissue was the baby and the placenta getting flushed out.<br>  Im sorry I know how this feels I've had 2 miscarriages before I got pregnant with this miracle baby.|`|hw3OMoeZaa	You need to see a Dr. to make sure everything is out.  This procedure is called a DnC.  Making sure it is all out will keep you from getting an infection.  Good Luck and sorry for your loss.|`|v1nUmhLTaa	Definitely sounds like a miscarriage. I'd suggest going to your OB-Gyn and being checked out, make sure all the material is out of your womb so no infections develop and that everything still looks normal.<br>  <br>  After my miscarriage nobody ever checked, but it is important to make sure you are healthy. They can recommend a counselor who has experience with this kind of trauma if you need to talk to someone, too.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	It's still part of the misscarriage,it can take awhile to bleed out.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Have you been to the doctor? They will clean you out completely.
sK67bBy5aa	Is your period late?|`|alJA3jyCaa	Have you missed your period? The best time to take a preg. test is first thing in the morning, at least 10 days after sex or better after u miss your period. It sounds like you could be pregnant|`|jZPv153Jaa	i think if he was man enough to finish in you than he can go buy the test your mom doesnt have to buy it.. . .|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	If your period is late and you start throwing up - usually around 3-4 weeks after...........then you might be pregnant.<br>  <br>  You need to be 18 to buy them from a walmart, I would ask your mom or someone you trust for a pregnancy test, even if it's an older friend or cousin or something, you need to find out for sure.
sK67bBy5aa	There is a very good chance. I would take a test saturday or sunday!|`|jZPv153Jaa	i think you should wait a week|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	Go buy 2 or 3 pregnancy tests this weekend and then find something to take your mind off this until next week when you will know for sure.<br>  <br>  I know its hard NOT to think about, but you're just going to drive yourself crazy.<br>  <br>  Trust me a little break this weekend - like going to dinner or seeing a good movie - will help you relax a little.<br>  <br>  You have all of next week to freak out ;-)|`|XcX73990aa	i dont think so, wait about a week then buy a test sorry to keep u waiting.|`|6DVzpa1Caa	there is a HUGE chance you may be
lzEuuseJaa	Some of the students are receiving needs-based financial aid, usually between 20 - 40% at schools like those you mentioned. That doesn't necessarily mean they are receiving full tuition awards. <br>  <br>  However, there isn't enough aid to go around. Many of the parents I know who send their kids to private schools that run from $12,000 to $30,000 earn $100,000 - $250,000+ a year. Of course, some make much more. (A 7th year attorney in biglaw in a large city makes $240,000+.) Friends who send their kids to elite boarding schools likely make $300,000+. <br>  <br>  And there are always more applications than space available at top private schools, no matter what the economy.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I have no clue.<br>  <br>  My soon to be in laws have offered to pay for my son's private school.I don't know what they make.|`|jLYTKr33aa	My son goes to an independent school, although it doesn't cost as much as Andover.  Our family would be considered upper middle class, I suppose.  We're not filthy rich, but we do well.  My husband and I also take our son's education seriously.  I'd much rather spend money on his education than an expensive vacation or the newest SUV.<br>  Keep in mind that many students at Andover, Exeter, and other prep schools are on need - based scholarships.|`|zmpk29BLaa	I don't know. My younger sister is a senior in high school at a private boarding school in Virginia, it's over $21,000 a year. That's more than my college tution!|`|9mSIQA2Baa	It defiantly depends on the family. For some people it's a total splurge and for other it's just an investment for there children.
FCQn5abyaa	You have brand name clothes, a Wii, and a camera:  it definitely doesn't sound like you're being deprived.<br>  <br>  Your parents have the responsibility to keep you fed, clothed, educated, and to have a roof over your head.  It is your right to have all those things.  You also have the right to feel loved and safe.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have all that and a lot more.  However, having things doesn't make someone spoiled.  Being whiny, ungrateful, demanding, and acting entitled makes someone spoiled.  So, you decide; are you?<br>  <br>  By the way, constantly comparing yourself to others can only make you feel unhappy and inadequate.  Also, pitying yourself is not attractive.  Don't fall into that.  Make the decision to be happy with what you have.|`|9jJnDQ6uaa	no. not at all. the brands you listed aren't super expensive (compared with: lucky, 7 for all mankind, even guess). the jeans there would cost you $100.00 and up. video games and cameras are pretty commonplace for kids these days and unless you're still in elementary-lower middle school i'm actually surprised you don't have some sort of cell phone/mp3 player, even a cheap one.<br>  <br>  but don't be upset just because your friends get more than you. what is it that you actually want? if you're twelve and ask for an iphone, i doubt you're going to get it. but if you "make deals" with your paarents you could start to get more of what you want. say, if you make all A's on your next report card, they buy you an mp3 player or something else you want.<br>  <br>  my other suggestion would be to ask your parents for a visa gift card or a prepaid card. the card is prepaid, so you can't spend too much. ask for an allowance per week or month to go on the card, and then buy whatever it is you want. to convince your parents: try telling them it will teach you how to budget your money. you'll have to decide exactly how to spend your money and what to spend it on. that way, if you want to save and buy an ipod, you can. you can even save up and get something they might not have and would wish they had.|`|D5N8s7weaa	When my brother and I were kids we had to work hard for everything we had, including close. We didn't have video games or cameras. I have a teen daughter of my own and I like to get her nice things when I can, but she knows how hard I work for it and appreciates every little thing I give her. The question is do you appreciate the things your parents do for you and understand that sometimes parents just don't have the money.|`|ttyXcsLxaa	lol .. spoiled is ... when u ask for it then u get it ... <br>  <br>  <br>  n theres nuttin wrong bout being spoiled neway ... jst make sure that u dont hurt sumone or make sumone jealous .... SHARE 'EM!!!!|`|Xpd9v2lvaa	No, everyone else is spoiled. You might be the lucky one.|`|AA12305061	A) I'm confused by your question|`|DcLiW4bbaa	You are only spoiled if you care so much about getting everything your own way that you don't give a crap about other people's feelings or beliefs.<br>  <br>  Or if you would throw a fit because you want something and your parents said no, or if you do mean things to get what you want then you are spoiled. Otherwise, don't worry about it. :)|`|fc5KHr6aaa	Doesn't sound like you are spoiled. Sounds like your parents care for you and you are well taken care of. Be thankful that they don't give you everything you want!|`|ZejwYamhaa	Well obviously you don't think you are spoiled. I don't think you are spoiled either. <br>  I'm confused about your question though, did someone call you spoiled?|`|fQuPOe3Haa	no|`|Chib4b8saa	Not to be crude, but in today's tough economic woes, be happy just to have a roof over your head and food to eat; how nice for you and your friends to have it all; not everyone is so fortunate; maybe you should think about them instead of sitting around feeling sorry for yourself because you only have a Wii and a Camera; big whoop! What about the girls your age who barely have clothes on their backs at all or a warm place to call home? Grow up and stop whining; tell your parents that you appreciate all that they do for you and provide for you.|`|GEsyKBeUaa	no. you are not spoiled. your friends are.<br>  <br>  spoiled people always thing great about themselves. they get EVERYTHING they want. they are usually snooty too. and wear only hollister, abercrombie and AE..etc.(even though those brands are very popular now)(most people have camera and video game systems) but, you are spoild if you have like 10 ipods, 2 cameras, only those brand names, ect..all that stuff|`|xvtufc7faa	Naw you're not. Trust me, if that's call spoiled then what about me? Clothes are fine..everyone wears somewhat the same brand of clothing. Camera and wii are really normal to have these days because a lot of kids get that for Christmas or birthdays. All my friends said I'm spoiled because I get mostly whatever I want, the ipod touch, a brand new car once i turned 16, nice camera, a brand new computer in my own room, and just other things. So you're not..just ignore them. You're a good kid compare to me.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Your well off, it doesn't matter what your friends got...grow up & buy your own stuff then you can have ALL YOU WANT!! Your parents aren't cash registers!!|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	NO your not, stay strong don't go to the darkside of Apple products. Eat yourself some beef and all will be good.|`|6bK5Vfpdaa	NO you're no spoiled......|`|ErvieIR7aa	no|`|MXnSWKCkaa	it doesnt matter if ur spoiled or not u should be happy 4 what u have
w4eeMjvjaa	I'm an ARDMS registered ultrasound technologist, and am about to start medical school this year. <br>  Please know that pelvic ultrasound requires us to take multiple images including measurements of the uterus, ovaries, and endometrium.  We take many measurements, often more than once for accuracy.<br>  Furthermore, please don't go by where you think the "wand", or transducer, was on your pelvis when the tech took the "measurement." We scan practically the whole pelvis from right to left from the mid-line position.<br>  If you are pregnant you are very early- probably too early to see anything at all. Ask your doctor why transvaginal wasn't done, that is the better exam for first trimester pregnancy evaluation.|`|hw3OMoeZaa	was it an in-vaginal ultrasound? They may have been measuring your uterus but it's hard to tell.  I would take another test in a week if you don't hear back from them.  Did they do any blood work or urine test to see if you were expecting?  Good Luck|`|lRq81lu7aa	I am not  a doctor.<br>  <br>  But there could be a chance you are pregnant.  Ultra sound techs aren't really supposed to say what they are seeing until they speak to the doctor.  It makes you anxious but that is how it is.  <br>  <br>  If they were measuring they could have seen something, but they need the doctor to confirm it.<br>  <br>  So, take a breath, and be patient. It is really hard to be patient, especially if you really want a baby.  But you have to be.
kQPQolVEaa	unless it is part of your heritage to give your children Native American names, it would not recommend it. first, the average kid will likely make fun of it, and secondly such a unique name could affect him poorly later. in this book i read that really "outlandish" sounding names statistically dont get hired to the better paid positions. <br>  <br>  not that im bashing your child, who could be the next bill gates, but in general the statistics show that|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Not the biggest fan of it, honestly.

No.|`|10YksH8caa	nah, try another one|`|EdLeOUBfaa	Maybe for a middle name, but if you name your child that they will be made fun of in school, plus, none of the teachers or students will be able to spell it.|`|kLUIBz9Haa	I almost thought it was another troll trying to say they had more than 8 babies.<br>  <br>  No. Sounds awful, and not a good meaning either.|`|AA11273571	Chewing Elk sounds better.|`|UXxsDUECaa	Wow, and people thought I picked weird names.|`|valvULe3aa	WTF?!?! It's a horrible name. He will be picked on in school! NO!!!|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Yes I will consider it for my next baby boy if I have one.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	I think it sucks...|`|RMYvrn1Qaa	You are kidding, aren't you?|`|2rOQyvaKaa	No.|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Ummm.

fZ3QvagVaa	I would go to the doctor and get checked cause it can be numerous of things so the best thing to go get check.|`|v1nUmhLTaa	It's probably just after effects from the procedure. If your doctor specified how long to go without sex, did you make sure to follow that? My doctor opted not to do a D&C after my miscarriage, but I was told no sex for a minimum of two weeks.<br>  <br>  It can also be an effect of having been pregnant, your body has to rewire its hormones basically, and you may spot for awhile and your period may be irregular.
teptsmeKaa	As mentioned above, g-Diapers are not 100% friendly since you do flush the liner... I personally am going to be getting Fuzzi Bunz pocket diapers, totally re-usable (link below)! <br>  You could also opt for more natural bathing and skin care products for baby, like Burts Bees Baby (link below). There are also washing detergents that are environmentally friendly to use in the washer, like Seventh Generation (link below)... and others are out there.<br>  I haven't seen any in stores, but I know their are "organic" matresses for cribs with no chemicals online. As well as 100% natural cotton sheets and clothing if you want to go that far (although it could get expensive!)<br>  Glass bottles would also be a better choice down the road than plastic... we all know how bad plastic is for the environment and chemical-wise (think BPH, if that has just finally been discovered... imagine what else we're missing...)<br>  Hand-me-downs would be a good enviroment saver (as well as save your bank account)! <br>  Otherwise, I think everyone else has mentioned what else you could do.<br>  It's really great that you want to be environmentally friendly, I wish there were more people like that!<br>  Good luck!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	breastfeeding---no bottles, no need to use water etc.|`|puCOYwMmaa	Using washcloths instead of disposable wipes.  Getting cloth and wooden toys instead of plastic, generally reducing the amount of plastic things you use.<br>  <br>  You should read "Raising Baby Green" by Alan Greene.  It has tons of good information in it.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I agree, full cloth diapers are more ecofriendly than the Gdiapers (cheaper too LOL).  I babywear and cosleep, though my toddler is in a bed of her own most nights.  She does join us when she feels like it though, and we're getting a BIGGER bed to accommodate it better ha ha.<br>  Strollers, cribs, swings etc are all unnecessary, no matter what some say.  It's up to you.  The only time I used a stroller with Sophie was at the mall if I had to get a LOT of stuff, so I had a place to put it lol!  I mostly wore her and put the bags in the stroller.  ;)<br>  Extended breastfeeding is great for sure.  :)<br>  I also use earth friendly household cleaners and soaps, from Planet Ultra and Shaklee.  It's good to know my daughter is safe; she will not be harmed if she accidentally ate them!<br>  We use California Baby, Alba Botanical and Burts Bees body care products.<br>  We also have cloth wipes to go with our cloth diapers, and use them in place of Kleenex as well.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Breastfeeding and cloth diapers.  Gdiapers still throw part of the diaper away...<br>  <br>  (I heard you shouldn't flush them even though they say it is okay -ruined many a septic...)<br>  <br>  Also cut down on baby "stuff".  No crib (baby sleeps with you), no stroller (get a sling instead), buy a convertible car seat so you don't buy two (infant and eventually forward facing), etc...<br>  <br>  Don't bother with baby gadgets (swings, bouncers and the like).
EJ9aEaOpaa	don't give him any food with sugar in it, don't let him take a nap or don't let him take a long nap. DON'T let him sleep in your bed,, he'll get use to it and start waking up and fussing just so he can sleep in your bed. Let him sleep on his own even if he's fussy let him stay in his room as long as you can tell that he is ok, it won't hurt him and he'll learn to put himself back to sleep.|`|5LwBf3lOaa	Yeah I'd avoid any sugar products before bed like the previous guy said, and I'd really wear him out. And what I mean by that is, try to limit naps to very short or even non-existent. You have to get your kid to be on YOUR sleep schedule. For example w/ my daughter, She takes a nap between 11 - 2, no later. And I only allow her to sleep for an hour to an hour and a half. I then keep her up and active until around 7, then I give her a nice warm bath. By 8 she's normally out for the count. And if she's fighting a little bit, I may put her blanket in the dryer for a few mins to warm it up...|`|bVkIEpyGaa	My 2 year old daughter wakes up every night. She used to get out of bed and scream for us, however now we leave her a drink of milk or water in a sippy cup by the side of her bed, and she just drinks that and goes back off to sleep by herself.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	He doesn't have to be scared of 'something', he might just be scared of being alone.  He doesn't know that you're just in the next room or that you'll be there in the morning.  He might not understand those concepts of space & time quite yet.  He's terrified because he wanted you & you weren't there & didn't come.      If you are not comfortable with him sleeping there in the bed with you - if you don't get a good night's sleep with him there, then you'll have to figure out another way for everyone in the house to get a healthy night's sleep.  This includes your son, your husband and you.      Do you have room for a bigger bed in your room?  How about a bed big enough for dad & son in his room?  A sleeper sofa?  A comfy recliner?  Could your son sleep on a cot in your room or a cushion on the floor?      Would he fall asleep again, in his own bed, if you cuddled him right away, reassuring him that you are there for him if he needs you in the night, chasing away that fear, then laid him back down with some soothing music playing?     You do have a right to sleep comfortably at night.  He has a right to do the same, not just physically, but emotionally.  Get to know him.  Try out different approaches.  You will find a compromise that leaves everyone sleeping well at night.|`|KHZLPldraa	This is going to sound crazy but I agree with Maureen.  We actually went out and bought a bigger bed for this reason.  My 16 month old can be found almost every night in the middle of our bed sound asleep.  However our situation is a little different as my daughter still needs to have her milk in the middle of the night or like last night 3 times.  She has severe dairy and soy allergies so her "prescription milk" or rice milk doesnt keep her held over all night long yet so0o0o it leaves us to deal with it.  I also work and I must be up and out the door early so some mornings I am miserable but for the most part it works for us.  Because I will admit I am too lazy to wakl to her room every night when she wakes up.  She will sleep in her bed but she sleeps better and for a couple more hours at a time when she is in our bed.
TQW5E6olaa	YES, Johnny, will LOVE it. And since he's walking now, he'll love the freedom to roam exhibit to exhibit.     We took Bella for her first birthday about a month after she started walking. Ours is also a HUGE aquarium, she had so much fun. Babies as young as 6 months were enjoying watching the fishies. We have video of her toddling around on her shaky little feet. We had such a great time, we bought a membership and go once a month (it's only 30 minutes away)    We tried it out at Pecto first- to see if she even cared about the fishies :)    Forgot to add, get picture of his face while at the touch tank, Bella liked playing in the water but got very upset when a ray came up and touched her little hand, she screamed "ewwww!" and made the funniest face :) Definetly, get to the touch tank!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Definitely! We took Dylan to Busch Gardens (with his sister) when he was about 12-15 months and although he cant quite express himself and talk about what hes seeing, he LOVED the colors, the movement, the animal life. Just the overall interaction with other people, other kids, and of course, the animals.     Hes now 2 yrs old and ready for another trip. Im excited to see him NOW because hes going to have so much to say about everything.     I think Johnny would enjoy it! And of course, Mommy would too! Then you can start pointing out animals in real life that maybe you saw in movies. Nemo? Sharks Tale? The Reef?    Go for it. And pack snacks if you do. Theres usually nothing but junk type food at those places. I always pack snacks, healthy ones, and try to go early because you know naptime comes along and the kids always get fussy.     HAVE FUN!|`|dPyfP0ijaa	Yes. If you want them to remember, they won't but I see many babies at the aquarium and they love it. It's a relaxing environment.|`|ENANtueuaa	Yes, i would! It's a big place, but as long as he's in the stroller or holding your hand, he'll be fine. Kids love to look at fish, and all the bright colors. Wish we had one of those around here!!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Yes I would!  We took Chase to the zoo when he was 11 months old and he had a blast, especially at the aquarium.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I love that Aquarium.  check out the fridays after 5 they usually have a deal running this time of year or maybe its in march - but its cheap.  the going rate is like $20 per ticket, not sure on discounts for kids though.  i'm about the same distance myself.    if he loves the walmart fishes and the petsmart ones too he would love that place.  its awesome.  i haven't got up off the money (or the thought of being in the city traffic) to take my kiddies yet but i know they would love it.  have a great time!|`|s1zitZMOaa	Yes, but with some cautions.     We took ours to the zoo for her second birthday and it was only 30 minutes away (we've done the aquarium too but she was a little older).   It would be best to have 2 other compassionate adults with you (so if you can enlist a grandparent or a good friend) so there are extra people to entertain and toodle if/when things go south. Plan to take things really slow and expect to take a nice break every hour or so for a snack and a rest because they will get tired - it's really exciting and overwhelming to a little one. Also don't plan on staying a really long time. Chances are that you're only going to get 2 or 3 hours out of them but you could get more. We got 2 1/2 hours at the zoo and 3 1/2 at the aquarium. But she thought it was the greatest thing in the world while it lasted. So as long as your expectations are realistic, do it.     As a side note, mine is almost 3 and she still thinks a trip to Petsmart (down the road) is the greatest thing in the world. We generally spend about an hour and a half in there. They have fish, turtles, birds, hamsters, snakes, dogs and cats, and then we buy stuff for our own dogs, cats, and fish.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	We took Landon to the big aquarium in Atlanta, GA when he was 11 months old. He loved looking at the fish but he got bored easily. They had a 3D show about fish that sprayed water on you, and he screamed bloody murder. Now that he is a little older he would probably enjoy it a lot more. When it warms up some, we are taking him into New Orleans to go to the zoo and the aquarium there.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Absolutely. My daughter made her first visit at about 3 months on a family trip. It was really fun.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yeah! I am taking Jacob to the aquarium on Myrtle Beach when he's 12 months old in June.|`|GZdvHbT5aa	YES!! Now this I think would be a great idea. We took Sam right before Christmas to the Atlanta Aquarium and he had a blast! He was so interested and captivated by the big fish, his little face would light up at every new fish that swam by!|`|2xS1Jro7aa	Yes! He will love it! We took my (at the time) 10month old nephew, 2 year old nephew and 4 year old niece to the one in Chicago and it was a 3 hour drive. They loved it so much! They are also big fans of the fishies at walmart and when ever they are good in the store we go look at the fishies before we check out for a treat hehe! Just make sure you bring a Camera because the way his eyes will light up and the amazement on his face will be priceless! Good luck and have lots of fun if you take him! Oh yeah don't forget a stroller in case he gets tired of walking!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Yes I would toddlers would love it and enjoy it.Although Johnny may not remember.But you can tell him all about it when he is older.And watching him have fun may bring sparkles to your eyes.kids love that stuff.|`|1768faf9e5b2a30b04ec84addc43d163aa	Yes if he seem very interested and you have the gas money, etc. Then GO FOR IT!! Have fun!!|`|AA11481889	Heck ya!!  I took my son to Sea World when he was 9 months and he LOVED it.      He knew nemo and dori and he touched a starfish and watched shamu...    We drove three hours for that....and I'd do it again in a second.    I think Johnny would love it.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	Yes.|`|dp7VR8BJaa	I think you and Johnny will have a wonderful time.  I have been contemplating a trip down to the Monterey Bay Aquarium which is about the same distance for us, 1 1/2 hr. drive.  I think we will go in a couple of months, with Aaron's cousins.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	Sure thing! Man if it was as bit closer I'd make a trip up there too! Caleb's so into animals these days I think he'd have a ball. Personally, I'm a wimp so I wouldn't go unless my husband or mom could accompany me to help out, but we're hoping to make a trip to the Baltimore Aquarium this summer sometime! Especially if he'd take a nap in the car so he'd be fresh for the fishies, I'd totally do it.|`|AA12145826	As long as you would enjoy it too, I'd say go for it!    We have a pretty nice aquarium at our zoo (Columbus Zoo & Aquarium, in case you're wondering) that I started taking my daughter at when she was about 11 months old. She LOVED it. In fact, we've had a membership ever since. When she was still in a stroller, we'd wheel her into the aquarium and sit with her by the glass. She'd watch it for hours if we let her. 6 years later, its still her favorite spot to go to in the zoo.|`|WirFwirLaa	Sure would. Heck over the summer I took my 7 month old to the Aquarium in Gatlinburg Tennessee. I know he was small but I think he enjoyed it none the less!|`|FUOLr64jaa	We just took Austin to Ripley's aquarium last weekend and he seemed to really enjoy it - it's about an hour from where we live.  The only "problem" was that he didn't want to sit in the stroller much - he wanted to get out and walk around and look at everything.  I can't wait until it warms up so we can take him to the zoo!!|`|HUQQzph2aa	Yes.    My daughter loves the aquarium. We started taking her when she turned 1 and been atleast a dozen times already. We are planning on taking her about 2 hours away to a larger aquarium this summer...can't wait.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	I took T to the MOA aquarium when she was lik 6 months for the first time and she loved the colors and the water movment. I actually had to Shush her a few times she squealed so much..lol. So if you think he would love it I say go for it.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Yes!!!!  That was Connor's favorite thing at the zoo on Saturday!!    I took Aidan to the big one in Corpus Christi, TX when he was 17 months old and he absolutely loved it!  (Can I still say Texas around here?  Lol)|`|cAtWxJG1aa	yes.  someone asked earlier about the zoo, and my kids weren't really interested in that until later.  but all my kids could sit mesmerized in front of fishtanks from their earliest toddler days.|`|UUpsa35Daa	I think it would be a really great day trip for him. I'm only 17 and i love watching the fishes at the aquariums near by so i can imagine how much babies love them haha.    It could be a mommy-son bonding/relaxing day just for the 2 of you.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Sure!  I wouldn't expect a long attention span, but I would make the most of whatever he seemed interested in.
LDsU43SCaa	Good for you guys getting past the initial drama to become friends eventually.<br>  <br>  Friendships don't work out sometimes.  People can change, circumstances might be different, grow apart, bad vibes...<br>  <br>  Try to accept less invitations to hang out and not initiate conversations very much.  After awhile you may be able to re-evaluate how you feel (you might change your mind and want to stay friends with Kate) and let her know that you guys are drifting apart and you wish her well.<br>  <br>  Or just keep it friendly and wait for HS to be out.  After that's over it doesn't really matter what other people are up to. :-)<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|YDKDpj6laa	confusing! you should just stop being friends with her if you dont want to but think it through dont go and try to be her friend a week later, even though i dont know her, i swear she'll kill you.<br>  good luck.:)

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	contractions should be steady and about 10 minutes apart, they need to be more painful that a severe menstrual cramp. It does sound like your starting and it wouldnt be a bad idea if you went into urgent care and have it checked out. You dont want to be too late. Or be the one that has there kid on the bathroom floor.    Ive had one daughter and am 33 weeks pregnant with my 2nd, I have had false and early labor since 29 weeks. I am not being  smart *** I was just commenting. No need to get upset too much just sit back and relax. Time the contractions. If you cant then go in... there is nothing wrong with it.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	it could be the start!!! Good luck!!|`|TOljxMLMaa	Yes I would call the doctor!|`|AA11603810	Time the contractions.  If they get closer together, I'd call your doctor... who will probably suggest you come in either way.|`|Tdzk4o5Iaa	Glad you have time to be on Yahoo Answers when this is happening to you, don`t forget to check your myspace too, while your at it, before you got to the hospital.    People these days.|`|NZhPNH1taa	Until your contractions become more evenly spaced and regular, you should be OK.  Once this does happen, however, you should have someone with you immediately, and should be getting to a hospital.|`|8IfePMa3aa	Hey, I think I'm in labour!

Are you timing them.  If they are coming at regular intervals, you could be in labor.|`|ltHKURBhaa	YES GO TO DOCTOR NOW|`|Zb7AGTwAaa	GO NOW....THERE IS NO NEED TO WAIT....YOU ARE ALREADY 41 WEEKS!!!!!|`|UiXJLrDWaa	yes got call your doctor asap. good luck!|`|bDRDJ8Vtaa	You need to phone your doctor. Do not take advice on serious medical issues from anonymous people who have no medical training on yahoo answers.|`|tht0DrHsaa	You could be going into labor on your own.  Make sure your house and everything is in order.  Keep track of the contractions and see if they start getting harder and closer together.  Take a nap if possible and eat something light and with a lot of carbs.  If you are going into labor you will need all the energy you can get.  Good luck and I hope if it is labor everything goes smoothly for you.   P.S.  Don't listen to the tards on here.  The best rule of thumb is if the contractions are not regular and they are not strong enough to bring you to your knees then the baby is not coming out anytime soon.  It sounds like you are in the begining stages of labor so you have a while.  You should call your doctor but if you are not in active labor they will not keep you at the hospital.   Just relax and time the contractions see if they are regular.|`|e8bebccef3197b177b82a931429a64fdaa	I would call a doctor and go to the hospital, it sounds like your ready to pop, i have five kids and if i were you i would get to the hospital, good luck!!!!|`|o1OJwqExaa	OH WHY WAITE FOR ?

People really need to stop asking questions like this online and believing the answers of people who have no clue. it is not recommended you life more than about 25 pounds but I a women who lifted a large box of plastic cosmetic earrings and she picked it up wrong and hurt herself and miscarried.

I wouldnt risk it though. If its too heavy, have your husband or family help you.|`|AA10381258	It is fine to do laundry and all normal activities during the first trimester. Later on, you'll find this takes a lot more effort and it will tire you out faster. You'll need to start taking it easy. The reason for not lifting too much later on is because it can trigger contractions that could cause preterm labor.|`|4QCYjPYhaa	I was advised that its not that it is harmful to the baby but to your body because of all the changes your body is going through, it is stretching and growing out like it is not use to being so you could be at higher risk of pulling a muscle or ligament.|`|erKyfwSbaa	It should be okay for the 1st trimester.

e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Continue to prepare her meals and make sure there are the veggies, etc. if she doesn't eat them give her fruits as a snack.  No pudding or ice cream.  She only gets that when she eats at least 4 bites of her meals.  Tell her and stick to it.  She will eat.  If she refuses and has nothing for days call the dr and tell them she's refusing and any advice on making sure she stays healthy and has the nutrition.  You may want to get those shakes that have vitamins and minerals in them.  Tell her they are a milkshake.|`|n53HeORBaa	mix in the veggies in small amount with the  pudding until she got used to the taste, be sure that this is in small amounts and one type of vegetable at a time <br>  don't mix it with the ice cream though, it would make her puke|`|D5cOFZdwaa	My daughter is the same age and is doing the EXACT same thing. if i cant get her to eat i put carnation instant bfast in her milk so shes getting SOME type of nutrition. good luck

The point that the hcg level is going up rather then down is a GOOD sign.    Yes, that is why most Ob doctors wait till you are in your 12th week to give an ultrasound.  That's when I had mine done.  Keep in mind.  My hcg level was SO LOW and it took awhile to climb.  I now have a 11 month old baby boy as you know.  So, sometimes it just takes awhile for the pregnancy hormone to kick in, okay?  I'd say chances are good.  Lets be positive!!!|`|4DoXomHZaa	Neways, neways...holy moly.    You will have to wait till Thursday. If you were losing it the numbers would be going down. It's still possible it's ectopic and they missed it.    Good luck|`|7iMZ91K7aa	Oh sweety, please try and not worry so much! Everyone else is right, the fact that your numbers continue to go up is a good thing.. Your still so early in your pregnancy, its hard for the doctor to find anything.. Just try and relax, I'm sorry you have been having issues, but you just worry about doing whatever you can to make sure that baby is kept safe right now.. relax, don't do a lot of work or heavy lifting... you just take care of your little baby... Please keep us updated! I was really starting to get worried about you!|`|yCR6qg0baa	Well, he's a doctor & I'm not, but I'll give it a shot. You tell how far along you are based on the first day of your LMP. Today, you would be 41 days or almost 6 weeks. The baby would still be too small to see (which is probably why he didn't see it). I don't know why your numbers would have nearly doubled if you were having a miscarriage, so I think that can be ruled out. As for an ectopic pregnancy, I think they would have gotten some proof after all that blood work! My point: There is nothing showing that anything is wrong with this pregnancy, so don't worry about it. I'm not pregnant yet & I've gone to the hospital a couple times because of excruciating abdominal pain... they've never been able to say what it is. It always left just as quickly as it came. Best wishes with everything.    PS- see your regular OB/GYN to be sure. ER doctors have VERY limited experience with that kind of thing. He probably had a one semester ob rotation in college & has forgotten most of it by now. The main job of the ER is to make sure YOU are breathing & your heart is beating. They don't really do specialty stuff.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hiya sweetheart.    hunni, its good they they increased and dont worry about not seeing anyhting so early on.    sweetie im praying for u and i hope ur  little 1 is going to be ok xxxxx    im sorry i cant give u a definate yes hun but u know where i am if u need me xxxxxxxx|`|AA10572259	Sorry to hear about all that.  I don't think there is anything you can do.  Stress over it will only make it worse.  I know its hard, I have a two year old but it took us years to get pregnant and had a false positive on a pregnancy test right before I got pregnant.  Just try to relax and do things to take your mind off of it. Good luck.|`|AA11920812	YES.    Everything you said yes.    That is why they don`t like doing ultrasounds before the 24 week mark. It is hard to see the yolk sac. Your doc is right there.    As for the numbers. You are right again. The numbers would be going down if you had lost the baby. So, you didn`t. He is probably saying he doesn`t want to be fooled by the numbers because he isn`t sure what will happen next.     You didn`t give a date for the 5000 number but they should be doubling or thereabouts every 72 hours. They won`t always double the farther along you get. Eventually they taper off and start to drop and stabalize.    Check this site out, you are right on target moma!    http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringp...|`|b97ab27d62fac407e8f40fe52edd9ae1aa	I know it is scary, but that fact that your numbers are increasing are a good sign! Since your LMP was 12-25, you are very early on. I will pray for you!! Although they say that the numbers should double, everyone is different. Trust your Dr and try to relax. I know it's hard..|`|Pxe5jVpPaa	Oh Iam so sorry to hear what all u went through. Iam so angry with people who told u had ectopic pregnancy. Y couldn't they double check? But anyways, alls well that ends well. Right now, the only thing is that u should not stress urself. I can understand urs and ur husband's anxiety. We all will wish well for u. Hope u become an awesome mother... God bless u...|`|XO4talxxaa	~HUGS~ Girl i am going to pray for you and your hubby and your little baby! I think everything sounds ok because your levels are still going up! Just please try to remain calm and try not to strss!|`|TtutLPsQaa	Oh boy. This is awful!! You need to stay positive and hope for the best, and please please PLEASE try not to stress! Honey, you've been so stressed TTC and then even with your BFP you feared for the worse..and our bodies can react super strongly to stress-even good stress! I know it's hard, and I know it hurts..but if you lose the baby, then stay positive. I really think you and your husband should watch "The Secret" It has actually helped me to almost completely eliminate my stress around TTC..and that takes something! Best of luck, you're in my thoughts and prayers :)
D78jfOMZaa	For the first time I have plans already made for the next couple of weekends. Well off course my parents are visiting so I will be hanging out with them:)    But something I want on the weekends it to SLEEP LATE and with a 6 year old I can't because you here this "I'm hungry, mammy..........I'm hungry"    Oh the joy of a parent lol|`|ZBSlbzYtaa	answer stupid yahoo questions|`|HGoAqr9Faa	i like to chill with my frieends,  look for hot guys in our neighborhood, (yeah,we're stalkers.^-^)  and listen to music all day. :D|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Relax!|`|djjVYhWiaa	I like to stay in with my partner, or a book or game!

GQ6f2wSbaa	Call her a "faker baby-maker"; wag your finger in her face as you do it.<br>  <br>  Another good one is to say, "Ain't nothin' in your oven but an ECHO, honey!"<br>  <br>  Also, "The stork is gonna stop delivering to your house since your last eight checks bounced!"<br>  <br>  Finally,you should tell her, "Sweetie, with all the babies you claim have come and gone, your hooch must have its own revolving door!"|`|7OZQ7PqTaa	You need to contact Human Resources and report her behavior-this is completely inappropriate and out of line. She obviously has emotional problems and you are doing her a favor by bringing this to the attention of those above her. Hopefully she can get some counseling...|`|zmbeIbx7aa	So your boss has no personal friends so she has to look to her employees to have them. Kinda weird. Good luck coming up with something witty.|`|xCifmFfkaa	Even your boss has a boss. I suggest you find that person, attempt to talk to them about this, and if no go, a phone call to HR should clear things up.<br>  <br>  This woman is CLEARLY abusing her powers, distracting employees from their work, and using their info innapropriately (calling all hours to talk about the contents of her womb? She serious?) and I'm pretty sure NONE of that was in her job description. <br>  <br>  Time to report her to the higher-ups... I'm not sure I'd put up with any more of her crap if I was you.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	Ask her questions about her "pregnancy" that only someone who'd ever really been pregnant would know. And then when she gives her "answers" have research to back up the fact that she's wrong! Ask her if her ears suddenly seem more prominent cause you heard that's a symptom that many pregnant women get around the 8th week. Try to "call her bluff" even though it's quite apparent that she's lying. Just humor her and listen, but then say something to make HER feel bad for YOU! Tell her that you really are pregnant and that she just interrupted you in the middle of a very important REM cycle. Ask if she has any medication for severe hypochondria. She might think it's a really bad disease. From the sound of it, she suffers pretty badly from it! LOL!|`|fHgbL046aa	I can't think of anything, but I'm sure someone can come up with something good. I knew someone like that and it turned out she has a personality disorder. Which by the way she liked hoping to get more attention. Good Luck with your boss

(I found out I was pregnant with a blood test!)|`|DRiSewgTaa	Hello im in the same situation too .........my test came up negative too.......but they say your hgc levels can be to low. you just need to be patience and go get a blood test done. Tell her to try and relax and try not  to think she is pregnant because that can make you not have a period and feel like you might be pregnant. Well good luck with everything and lots of baby dusts!!
AKJwWqdZaa	That set-up just screams trouble. I'm an adoptive parent and I cannot imagine going along with a roomate scenario. To say it would be creepy would be an understatement.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I guess it happens.  I think that the practice is one of the sickest forms of coercion EVER.  Can you imagine the debt someone might feel towards someone who fed and housed them in exchange for a baby?  I think it should be 100% banned from any adoption.  I am fully against pre-birth matching, and IMHO having a first mother live with the aps is just horrid. <br>  <br>  I would advise anyone considering adoption to stay the hell away from any AP who offers shelter to them.  There are places for that, places aren't wanting to take your baby away.<br>  <br>  Its just a tactic for those who want to troll for a baby.|`|Afoabqblaa	It happens, but it shouldn't.  Let them pay their own rent...if they can't afford to keep a roof over their heads, let them struggle it out instead of being OWED  to be taken care of by others.|`|JPBh5WT3aa	An agency in Pennsylvania has the first moms live with infertile couples who are in line to adopt or have already adopted from this same agency.  This way, the first mom can learn all about infertility.  Talk about coercion.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	I know a few girls that stayed with the Paps when they were considering adoption. <br>  <br>  From what they've told me....its exactly what people on here have been saying. Coercion!<br>  <br>  I just spent a long weekend with a girlfriend from highschool who said they used the lines....you're young you can have another one....you have your life a head of you don't ruin it by keeping the baby(its a burden) for someone your age...you mother/boyfriend won't help you and you'll be all alone...your not mature enough to raise a baby.....we have everything planned for his future and you can visit him when he's older.....etc etc. She had to listen to it for 3 months...day and night on top of dealing with the husband flirting with her.<br>  <br>  She kept her son and refused to let them name him Jedediah. <br>  The Paps then made up lies and called social services claiming she was using drugs which was false.<br>  Her son had to spend his first two weeks in foster care because her mother was on the Paps side until she actually got to hold her grandson and got over the teen pregnancy issue. She could only visit until they finished the investigation.<br>  <br>  How sweet huh. Nobody should have to go through that.<br>  <br>  <br>  One other women I know (who lived with paps) that ended up relinquishing and regretting it....didn't get to see her son again until he was 17. The Aps didn't keep their word and told her to move on. She actually hired private investigators to keep tabs on the Aps so she didn't lose contact. He ended up moving to her state and went to college nearby after she contacted him.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Our son's first mom actually asked us to move in, with the dad.  Quite frankly, I had more of an opportunity to show her ways to get help if she decided to keep the baby (she allowed us to adopt the first, and when pregnant with the 2nd, she moved in again and did keep her).  <br>  <br>  Any time 2 adult couples live together, it can be complicated.  I think in so many more ways though, it made all of our minds think more about the other person's concerns, and I know we became more compassionate towards their decision.  It also eased the first dad's mind he says, because he know that our (meaning all 4 of us) son will grow up in a happy home, without fighting like his home.  He knows that he can visit "J" anytime he wants, and knows that by getting to know us so well, that there's a trust there, and that he can come to us to help them, or if we need help, we can ask them.  <br>  <br>  We got to know each other very well, and found out we have a lot in common, and a lot of differenes, like the 1st dad loves to play basketbal, as do all his kids, and our little guy is already playing with one.  I can tell him he's got facial features from both parents, and that he walks like his dad, but that his serious face looks just like his brother "C".  <br>  <br>  Yes, the situation was complicated, hard, confusing in some ways, but so rewarding in others, but most of all, it made the transition to our home so much easier, because "J" was already used to our voices, the noises of our home, like the aquarium, and I think it helped his bonding with us.  It was NEVER in any way meant to be coersive, and quite the opposite was true.  The main thing I told her was, if she changed her mind, was to know that everthing I'd bought for him was his, and that I wanted him to have it if she did change her mind.  I did send stuff with her 2nd child, and we still get family visits from the dad's side, just not her at this point.  We're hoping she's more open in the future.  We did also provide a play for her to stay during her recovery time after the baby was born.  <br>  <br>  I've also helped other women who've stayed with us during pregnancy, knowing that they wanted to keep their child.  It works for the kids involved, who are the main ones who didn't get asked into that situation.|`|jHZqOuVEaa	Oh my, yes.  It is a tried and true coercion technique with roots in the Era of Mass Surrender/Baby Scoop Era.  In those dark days, not only did they live with the adoptive parents, but they were forced to be unpaid servants and free nanny service.  In some horrible cases, they were also forced to "service" the "man of the house".  All in the name of the "church".<br>  <br>  Today, it is used as a lure by some of the free agents on the WEB and even here on Y!A.<br>  <br>  Also, the LDS church adoption agency REQUIRES hopeful adoptive parents to warehouse pregnant women who are "matched" with other hopeful adoptive parents in the church.  In fact, there was a post on one adoption forum that I was reading where the warehousing family was complaining the the "preggo" girl seemed ungrateful and would not clean their house for them.  Hello!!!???  Ever wonder why LDS adoptions are cheaper?  There you go.  It is that free room and board.<br>  <br>  It's not complicated at all.  Unless for those who deny that coercion is alive and thriving.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Yes it's a coercive practice used by the US adoption industry to back a woman into a corner and ensure renlinquishment.<br>  <br>  It's also illegal in most civilized nations.   In the UK the Adopters aren't allowed anywhere near a mother until her baby is 6 weeks old and she is able to make a definite decision without duress.|`|frpCK0utaa	I always assumed this sort of thing was very rare. I don't think i could do it myself, if i were adopting. But then, i wouldnt do pre birth matching as it puts both people in an ackward position.
U1juqahIaa	That is awful! First of all, it doesn't flow.  Secondly, it's way too long and Three, it doesn't sound professional.  The poor girl is gonna be explaining her name for people forever. Imagine her applying for a job.  Employers will be more likely to hire someone named Anne or Mary than someone with an odd name like hers.      I love your suggestion of Kara Noelle.  That's a really beautiful name.  It's horrible that your friend didn't take your suggestion before saddling her daughter with that monstrous name.    I don't mind unique names, but this is way over the top.  There is a fine line between unique and ridiculous.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Wow, that's awefully long.  Why didn't you ask this question before she named it that, though, so you could show her how many people think she should have a shorter name? Are you going to try to convince her to change her daughter's name?     She could go by Christi, but still....|`|Elxuvon8aa	I is not horrid  very long  Kara Noelle is cute|`|xLabGD6Maa	I don't like it, but I guess if she and her husband like it, then that's what matters.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	WHAT?

fjHpA5oiaa	At night, bring him into bed with you, and he will probably sleep a lot longer, and so will you. I should probably say that there are a million warnings about not letting the baby into bed for fear of smothering. I personally go into an aware sleep and would never be able to roll over on the baby without knowing it. Not too many pillows or overly fluffy blankets. Put him in the middle so he doesn't roll off. If you are a heavy, wild sleeper, or your spouse, don't do it.  Another thing is, in the day, don't be quiet, ever. You need some noise. A baby that falls asleep during absolute silence will wake up at the drop of a pin. Get the baby to fall asleep during some sort of low noise, like a distant television, water evaporator, music, calm conversation, etc. He'll have to go deep to sleep, and is more likely to stay there. If you find that you are shushing people constantly, losing your mind about every sound, you know you're violating this rule.   He might have to cry it out the first couple times, and on random occasions after that. Maybe half an hour of crying, an hour if you are strong. More than an hour of crying, and I would try something else. If you go to a different part of the house, it won't drive you so crazy.    Good luck!|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Could be something itchey, irritating contents in any cuddly toys that are sold on the market today.  Do not put a lot of fabric softner that has perfumes in the wash so there is not "perfumey" odor in the child's clothing.  And  I have seen many Moms bring kids to the emergency room saying the kid will not sleep.  The kid has on 3 month age sleepers cramming their little toes at the bottom and making it impossible to get comfortable and stretch their little toes out and get rested.  I mean the little child's toes are like crammed in the bottom of tight fitting sleepers.  geez.  such simple things sometimes is all it is to get a night's sleep.    update:  make sure there is not a tag on the child's pj's on the back of the neck that is rubbing and irritating the neck area.  If you rip the tag out, make sure all of the tag is gone by pulling the irritating threads off the entire area.  and  does someone in the house smoke??????  stop that or suffer the sleeping issues for a lifetime.|`|acIHw8yAaa	It's all about getting them to learn to fall asleep on their own.  That mean, put her to bed drowsy not asleep.  For naps and bedtimes.  You can stay in the room and pat her but don't talk to her or pick her up.  She will fall asleep.  When she wakes up in the middle of the night, don't get her immediately.  Let her cry for five minutes, then check on her, but don't pick her up or talk to her.  Just pat her until she calms down and then leave the room.  Keep it up until she learns to fall asleep on her own.  It should take about 3 days.    Check out this article for more advice!  http://www.ehow.com/how_4749969_baby-sle...|`|toOzi7aLaa	Start a bed time routine. Toys shouldn't be a part of bed time. This is bed time not play time. A comfort blanket or bear is okay. Start with a warm bath low lighting not a lot of activity. Speak soft. Lotion diaper bottle/boob and lay him down in his crib with a bubby. it is okay for babies to cry and if he has not gone to bed do not give him any attention.     You can try sitting where he can see you but do not allow him to get the best of you. He needs to learn to self sooth. He already knows mommy can sooth he needs to learn he can too!|`|sHHskOflaa	johnson&johnson makes a great product that helps your little one sleep at night i dont remember the name of it but it is purple it comes in the baby wash and lotion

They will probably give you a prescription for a pill you can take daily to avoid them from happening again. Good luck GO TO HOSPITAL!!!!!<br>  <br>  I have 4 kids and had Braxton Hicks for 2 of them|`|qaMrAspCaa	I would say it's just "growing pains" I'm 35 weeks now and i'm having pains here and there. I feel fine when i'm sitting or laying down, but if when I get up to walk I also get cramps in my stomach and lower abdomen.  So we are opposite, haha! I think it's normal. But I don't have vomiting or headaches.  I also get the shooting pain down my leg (left leg) I think it's just baby's positioned wrong and is pinching a nerve. But if I were you I would just call your dr or midwife and tell them what's going on. It's better then not knowing. But since your baby is active im not too worried.  I think a warm bath will make you feel better.

bmoCpcdraa	call your local welfare office ask to talk to social worker they will send a social worker out to school to visit the social worker will pull the child out of class to ask them questions,if they have a problem they will remove the child away from  class to a foster home, so do not ,do not talk to parents of the other child cause if they get thier child taken away they will blame it on you,so the welfare will not tell the other parents who called them,they also do not need permission to do this.this is the best way ,the other child could be being abused|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I think you should take it to children services.

At the very least, the administration should have had a meeting with the parents. Maybe you could talk to the guidance counselor and she could meet with the over-exposed child to find out what is really going on.|`|RKTNDLDKaa	Well, if I were you, I would find out the boys full name.   Then I'd call Children's Services and make a hotline report of possible abuse.    This child is either seeing, hearing or being subjected to things of a sexual nature.    Any way you look at it, it's inappropriate and needs to stop.|`|6bK5Vfpdaa	You should talk to the parents of this child, or think about switching your son to another public school. That might help. I think that you should just keep complaining to the school until they do something because that is unacceptable behavior.|`|LId3qnI1aa	You need to keep talking to the teacher/the principle/whoever you can.<br>  <br>  If this is affecting your son and his enjoyment and learning at kindy, then you have a right to say something and make sure something is done.<br>  <br>  The other boy might be being exposed to things that he shouldn't, so maybe his parents need to be spoken to?<br>  <br>  You need to keep persisting until something is done, if the school refuses to do nothing, maybe you should head to the authorities(maybe DCP, if the other little boy is showing sexual knowledge beyond his years, it could be a sign of abuse)? <br>  <br>  I'm really not sure about the details of the situation, but i believe you have the right to be able to send your son to kindy without having to be worried about what might be happening.<br>  <br>  <br>  =]|`|dVAiuqZCaa	I'd call family services if the school wont do anything.Totally wouldnt put up with my kid being touched by anyone.Those kids obviously have been screwed up at home!!!!!|`|1qxhPyXzaa	call the police.  you son was touched inappropriately and the other children need to be protected too.|`|MXnSWKCkaa	if i were u i would talk to the parents cause thats NOT acceptable i would take the kid out of the school and put him in a different one cuz if they're only 5 they shouldnt have to deal with that stuff talk to the teacher and princible and tell them to actually DO SOMTHING instead of punishing ur kid that did nothing wrong tell them about the other kids<br>  hope i helped good luck and dont take that have a good day|`|hChhOhOGaa	You are the advocate for your child.  If you feel the school is not doing enough to handle the situation, keep making noise until they do.  Most public schools want to sweep things like this under the rug so as to not get involved.  They are afraid of liable suits, etc. so they hope the parents will just forget about it.  You should not forget about it.  Your son is being exposed to things that are not appropriate and they should ensure his and all the other children's safety and innocence.  If this means you have to keep calling until it's resolved then so be it.  You'll never regret sticking up for your own child...you'll only regret it if you let it slide and his emotional and physical well being is jeopardized from these incidents.  Good luck!  You are being a good conscientious mother just for following up in this forum.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	the boy shouldn't have been "disciplined" for innapporopriate touching, whatever that means. it should be expained to him that it is certainly not okay. As far as the 3rd hand conversation regarding the boy and sister sleeping "naked", if it was "handled" i would demand to know how it was "handled". the schools are mandated reporters of even suspected child abuse. if they can't give you a satifactory answer then i would contact child services directly. they will contact the school and find out what is going on, so that it can be addressed. -|`|xvtufc7faa	Wow. that school is F*ed up. It seems like you've told the principal about it, and apparently he thinks its a joke. What I think you should do is write a letter to the Superintendent because that always help, if not, write it to the school board. Another thing is have a sit down talk with that kid's parent. Because it might be his parents that he's seeing doing those stuff so that little boy is doing it to your son. Try those options, if it still doesn't work, you might as well transferred to another school because that kid is a homo!|`|yrx6GxDcaa	I would call the superintendent of your school system and get an appointment and bring this to his or her attention. For some reason some schools like to keep every thing in house go over there heads you can also as others have said report this to social services. The child that is doing this may be being molested this is one of the signs, and it needs to be investigated. Every thing with social services is confidential as far as the complainant is concerned. We as adults are the only ones who can protect our children and those children that suffer from there parents on abuse. Please do something.
qlj9u0VAaa	It all depends on your age and if you have a vehicle and are responsible. <br>  <br>  If your 17 or older with experience who drives to the house and maybe even responsible for bringing the kids to activities you could ask for 8 to 12 bucks an hour. This all depends on what your expected to do.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	i don't know. if their just out for an evening, twenty to thirty seems reasonable.|`|X3rQJhVMaa	Teenager babysitter get about 5- 7 dollars and hour. Seeing how your probably older and more a part time nanny then a babysitter . I would say 8.50 - 9.50 dollars and hour add 2 dollars per extra child. I would pay teens 6.50 for 1 child and for 2 7.50 for 3 I would pay 8.50 . If your a experienced adult you could maybe get 10 dollars and hour. Depending where you live. In Canada babysitters get paid more then in States Ive been told. Or you could make a card with flat rates like this and give it to the parents:<br>  <br>   Hourly rates ( add 2 dollars per extra child) : <br>  Half hour =  9.50$<br>  1 hour= 15.00$<br>  1 1/2 hour - 17.50$<br>  2 hours - 23.00$<br>  2 1/2 hours - 26.50$<br>  3 hours - 33.00$<br>  3 1/2 hours - 36.50$<br>  4 hours - 40.00$<br>  4 1/2 hours - 44.50$<br>  5 hours - 46.60$<br>  <br>  This way parents can have money ready and now how much exactly to pay.|`|riphnPNsaa	Depends on how long the parents are out. Depends on the age.|`|VGhy6Wdxaa	DEPENDS ON HOW OLD THE CHILD IS!|`|8Y3VYbUsaa	Some guys will do it for free!!|`|IccWdMrZaa	It depends how many kids. I babysit like three kids for $8 an hr...
HXfHkoSHaa	If your doctor feels the need to induce for the health of your baby, I'd definitely heed the instructions.|`|FplTPoAyaa	I am sure that your doctor knows best, but if you are unsure, ask for a second opinion.  It is within your rights, and if she is a good doctor, she will be happy to let you get a second opinion.  Good luck to you.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	You want to make sure that your baby is healthy. My doctor didn't even know for sure if there was anything wrong with my placenta but was worried because I measured too small. He said that the placenta stops working at 100% once past 40 weeks, so that if there was something wrong it would be better to not go past my due date. I was induced a few days before my due date with no signs of pending labor and my delivery went just fine. I know that lots of people have horror stories about being induced, and I'm sure it's different for everybody, but I was induced at 6am and had my son at 3pm, so not too bad. I would do what is best for your baby and the doctor usually knows what they are talking about. Oh, and there was nothing wrong with my placenta it was just small which caused my baby to be small, he was born at 6lbs. 5oz. but was a healthy little guy and caught up on size very quickly.|`|sDHxandWaa	Say something to your doctor. You're still the mom-to-be, and if you're uncomfortable you need to speak up. Ask her if it's completely necessary. If she says "I'd prefer..." then you tell her that NO, YOU'D prefer if she backed up and let you have this baby how you want. Unless there's a medical reason (and if you say the calcification is gone now) she can't make you be induced.|`|kT7GVOosaa	just remember that the dr. has the best interest of you and your baby in mind. she is only doing this because she thinks there may be a reason to. all will be fine. on Monday you will get to hold your newborn baby! Congrats|`|9P26sacKaa	I would get another sonogram.  After all, the technician could have misinterpreted what he/she saw.  Getting a second opinion is a good idea in this case.  Many babies are not ready on the due date.  The average first time white mother goes into labor naturally at 41 weeks and 1 day.      If there is, however, calcification on your placenta, it is a sign that the placenta is aging and may not be able to function adequately for much longer.  This is why induction would be indicated.  You could ask to continue having biophysical profiles completed until labor starts or you feel comfortable being induced.    It sounds like it's not serious, however, so telling her that you want monitoring and waiting might be just fine for baby.  I would get a second opinion and another scan.  I would also remind her that you are the authority over your body and she will kindly make recommendations, not direct orders.  You can still change doctors if you really want to.  She can't push you around.      If you are induced with a cervix that is not at all ready, your chances of a cesarean due to "failure to progress" are very high.  Labor will also be harder and more dangerous for you and for baby.  The risks of induction must be weighed against the risks of waiting it out.  If you are showing signs of calcification, it may be better to be induced at some point, but is Monday the right point?  This should be discussed with more than one doctor and you need to figure it out for yourself.  You have the ultimate decision.|`|8quTABk6aa	Since that's your due date, I would go ahead with the induction.  The baby should be full term.  And, a six-pound baby is more than big enough.|`|DDFSITiYaa	I would ask some questions if you have specific concerns.  Ask what the risks are and what the dangers on in waiting.       You are considered FT at 37 weeks so making it on your due date is certainly FT.|`|WGXdfh22aa	i would just go and be induced just because i would be worried about my baby. if your not sure i would ask your doctor how bad they think it is and what they would recommend. honestly though i would just get induced just to make sure my baby is ok.|`|bTbugHyaaa	Why would you even question what your doctor is saying. Your doctor has probably delivered a hundred some babies, and this is your first or second?? I would let the doc induce especially if the doc thinks something may  harm the baby. I mean he isnt even taking u early. Let the doctor do what he wants, he is the pro here.....  good luck|`|qHAgbuHkaa	If you had a normal placenta, I would say do not go with the induction because you can give your body more time to go on its own, but if you have placenta calcification and your doctor feels you should be induced, I would go along with it. If you're almost due, its possible that the placenta is wearing out sooner than it should and if a placenta is no longer working properly, the chance of stillbirth increases a lot. You will be due the day you're induced, so your baby will be perfectly healthy to be born that day, and if you're not dilated at all and the baby hasn't dropped, you will most likely be overdue without the induction and if you have calcification, its not safe to go past your due date. If your doctor waits for you to go on your own, it could another week or two before your body goes on its own. I really think you should go with the induction and just play it safe this time.|`|Gc1bznpTaa	Not sure what placenta calcification is but if your Dr suggests inducing, you should probably go with that.  Don't worry about small birth size if you are already 40 weeks, I am sure your baby will be fine.  I doubt you want any birth problems which may be associated with any sort of placenta problems.  Don't forget your placenta is an actual organ (an amazing one!) that is keeping your baby alive.  On this occasion I would be happy to take the Dr's advice.  Don't worry about the baby not being in position, you may have a more painful delivery by being induced, but it sounds safer than letting the placenta deteriorate any more.  Good luck with the birth...remember to buy the newspapers on the day your baby is born! x|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	First of all there is no way to know how much your baby weighs right now. The weight the ultrasound gives you can be off as much as 10% in either direction. My first child was suppose to be 7 lbs and he ended up being 6 lbs 2 oz., My third was suppose to be 8 lbs and she was exactly 9 lbs. Secondly inducing on your due date is not a big deal it is not like you are inducing early. I was induced with my first 2. I had not dilated, efaced or dropped at all with either and everything went fine. I delivered the first in 23 hours and the 2nd in 4.5 hours. The doctor is telling you what she thinks is the best course of action BUT you are the patient and if you are uncomfortable with her choice then ask her for your alternate options and what the potential risks are if you choose to wait.Make your choice once you are informed don't just guess or be bullied into something. You may go into labor b4 Monday anyway.
mc6YtaRbaa	It can not create a false positive. In fact it will work the opposite way. If you eat or drink prior to taking a test and you're not using your first mornings urine, you can dilute the amount of hCG in your urine which is what a pregnancy test detects to get the positive result.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	no only the pregnancy hormone will give you a positive read on those tests so if it said you were then you were.|`|WPI0Z47saa	no|`|p2l8zQYuaa	You have to take the pregnancy test with your first urine of the morning.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	no. hormones is what gives you a positive on an HPT.|`|jLNwrVZRaa	No, you can only produce the hormone HCG when you are pregnant.|`|AA11785285	No.  There is no such thing as a false positive.  The test tests for the required hormone to continue a pregnancy..  Nothing but a pregnancy does that.
