FplTPoAyaa	My 13 month old daughter had an ear infection every single month for the first 5 months of her life. Yes, 5 infections in 5 months.  It was crazy, and I was so worried about her.  I thought for sure that she would have chronic ear infections for the rest of her life, and that she would have to have tubes put in, but she outgrew it ! She has had only 1 infection (knock on wood) in the last 8 months.  many young babies have ear infections because their Eustachian tubes are not fully developed, and if she is using a bottle, never lay her flat when feeding her.  Also, my doctor told me to never use the nasal syringe to clean out her nose, because they have found that using the syringe can lead to ear infections.  Good luck !!|`|33h5R8nTaa	I would suggest with this ear infection talk to the doc about tubes..When i was little i got cronic ear infections like that and i have 5 sets of tubes. my daughter at 3 months had a ear infection but not one since. after each bath i clean her ears. Oh and my daughter takes her bottle laying down and has only had one ear infection. And i think that one was cause her grandma gave her a bath and didnt wipe her ears out after wards.|`|03b9cb4d0f4affafab8fb073ff4518feaa	My oldest daughter who is now 9 had the same problem. In fact the doctor told me one more time in at that age and they were going to put tubes in her ears. Found part of the problem was the bottle leaking down her cheek in to her ear which was causing a large part of the problem. Sucking on a pacifier didn't help either because of the drawing in on the ear drums. Sooooo, you may end up with her having tubes in her ears. Oh and for the record, her ear infections got much better once the bottle was gone. She occasionally still will get an ear infection but antibiotics take care of it pretty quick.|`|723QHuicaa	Is she bottle fed?    If she is and she lays down to take her bottle, the milk can dribble down and into her ears and this can cause ear infections. If she does, try propping her in a semi sitting position and see if it makes a difference.    My LO has had 2 chest infections in 4m and the dr said it was due to a variety of things - weaher, germs, people around her who are sick.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	That really isn't too bad.     With my first he had already had 12 ear infections by 12 months (Yes once a month sometimes twice!) and he had tubes by 14 months and tubes again at age 2. I often wonder if some of it was genetic because his birth father had chronic ear infections.    My second is 8 months old and has 2 ear infections. 1 was very severe. I'm not the least bit worried yet.    BTW if they gave her Omicef for the ear infection something they don't tell you is it may cause brick red poop in some babies. I learned that the last time he had an ear infection and I took him to the doctor thinking it was massive amounts of blood!|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	well at 3 montsh my daughter had tubes put in never had a single ear infection . but if your child is around smokers that can increase ear infections weither its them smoking then holding her different things|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It might or it might not, our oldest had a couple ear infections in the last few months of his first year, and then hasn't had one since - and he's 4.   Mostly with ear infections it's a function of anatomy and not much else, that is some folks are prone to ear infections due to their skull shape (and the shape of the ear tubes).
5Crovdoaaa	Go ahead and start the 3rd foods, if she's eating the puffs, she'll do fine with that. My 8 month old is eating the 3rds, the puffs, cheerios, cheddar cheese cut into tiny, tiny pieces, corn, elbow noodles overcooked so they're mushy,  and a little luchmeat shredded small. He fists everything also, but he gets some in there! Just follow her lead. Mine has been self feeding for a month now and will refuse to eat the jar foods most of the time.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Try steamed vegetables. Those "yogurt melts" are candy and the "puffs"  are no better than Cheetos; they're total junk food. Read ingredient labels carefully.    Plain Cheerios or any other not-too-sweet breakfast cereal will work for her to press onto her palm as you describe.|`|leGfABH4aa	most babies don't learn the pincher grasp until the end of 9 months, my daughter has already learned it and she is just about 9 months. when i handed her the puffs i would hold it in the pincher grasp and she would mimic me and now has learned to do it herself|`|joiacDUdaa	With our first son we were all unknowing and "careful" about EVERYTHING our son ate.. We went through all the 3 stages of babyfood... He fine healty and everything.. With our second son I nursed him just like the first for a bit over a yr. and we started him on babyfood at around 6 months/solids... I just cut up what we were eating into small bite sized pieces.  He did just fine. .My children especially like small sized pastas mixed with some spagetti sauce.  I bulk up jar sauce with carrots, onions, zuccunini,  just about anything I can put in the mini-chopper..   Or you can use puree- I use butternut squash puree inside macaroni/cheese.... They love it and eat it up.. It's cheaper and more healthy than jarred babyfood... Just make sure the pieces are small.       Good luck|`|pXSKSS3daa	We started our son on self feeding when he was 7 months and he only had two bottom teeth. Teeth don't really have much to do with it because babies can gum up softer foods well enough. She will use her gums and tongue to do so. So if that's your only concern then I'd say let her go for it. We steamed everything at first to help him out but now I just pop food in the microwave to take the chill off them and he does fine. He'll be 10 months old next week. Even though he CAN use his pincer grasp he usually grabs handfuls of food and shoves them in that way, lol.    Some foods to try are steamed veggies and fruits, pasta noodles, breads, and pieces of cheese. Just cut them up into smaller pieces that will be easier for her to grab.
Fsr2Rofzaa	nope too young.  You really should wait another 2 months at least.  No need to give a speech, however there is a reason pediatricians do not want you feeding cereal until 4 months, I choose to listen the doc!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Well if you need your sleep then go to bed earlier. He's only two months old, of course he's going to wake frequently throughout the night. Rice cereal is NOT a guaranteed fix for that issue. Patience and time are, though.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Have you thought about supplementing with a little formula?  I know I will get alot of thumbs down for saying so, but i would try that before I tried the cereal.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Go to bed earlier.    "another myth...    Rice cereal makes babies sleep    This one hurts. I know sleep deprivation and the desire to get a good night's sleep very well. But this one just isn't true.    Sleep patterns are developmental phenomenon, they don't have much to do with hunger patterns. Kids wake up hungry, but they don't wake up because they are hungry.    Cereals started as an important part of a child's diet back when the infant formula companies couldn't get an absorbable form of iron into the formula.  They then fortified rice cereal with iron and introduced the rice cereal early into the diet as a way to make sure the kids got the iron.  Chances are pretty good that the eventual increase in sleeping at night that happens around six to eight weeks of age coincided with the introduction of the cereal, but not because of it.    Now, all the infant formulas are fortified with iron and of course, breastmilk has an abundant and easily absorbable supply of iron in it, so we really don't need an extra source.  If you take away the iron in the cereals, it's just starch.     And if you buy this idea that rice cereal "sits" in the stomach, then we have to talk about that too.  Nothing "sits" in the stomach (even when kids eat pennies and stuff, that stuff passes).  It's a metabolically active organ always working to digest its contents.    And at least one study has recently showed that early introduction of rice cereal (prior to 4 months of age) is a risk factor for the development of diabetes.    Different types of food take longer to digest.  Starch, which is what rice cereal is, is really easily digested.  Starches are used as quick sources of energy.  If we stayed asleep for however long our bellies are full (which I don't believe either or we would never sleep for 6-8 hours a night) then starch would be a poor choice.  We would need to load our kids up with a Big Mac or something to get them to sleep longer since fat is the slowest food type to be digested.    That's a long explanation to say that I don't really think the cereals are necessary-- they aren't a good source of nutrition and they don't make kids sleep and may, with the new info on the link to diabetes, be actually be harmful.   The AAP says 6 months without solids...we are learning that the rush to solids foods is NOT a good idea."    http://www.drjen4kids.com/myths/mythrice...|`|DNygQdmVaa	No you shouldnt give babies any kind of solids until theyre 4 months old.  My sister in law tried giving her 2 month old baby cereal and some other baby food and she got ill.  She took her to the doctor and they told her her stomach couldn handle solids becauesshe was so young.|`|vue9NOhYaa	No, do NOT give your baby cereal at 2 months.  She is far too young.  I did not do it, because I knew better. Just because ONE mother writes that she did it and her baby turned out fine, why would you want to take the risk? (I never rode in a carseat as a baby, and I turned out fine.  Does that mean I should assure you that riding unrestrained is safe?)    A teaspoon of cereal isn't going to make the slightest difference in your baby's calorie intake. If he's  hungry, he needs more milk, not a little empty starch that will just sit in his belly.    If you suspect reflux (due to the spitting up) speak to your doctor. There are safer remedies for reflux that don't expose baby to the risks of early cereal. .    Finally... 2 month old babies can't eat from a spoon. The only way to get it down him would be to force it down (back in the days when early solids were routine, babycare books gave instructions on how to force-feed your baby).  Surely you don't want to do that.|`|jVhWIDRnaa	Uh-oh...I sense a debate coming....:)      I would discuss your concerns with the doctor first.|`|d4109476284b20a63738efbdf6f0a052aa	yea thats a myth.. and it doesnt help the baby sleep any longer.    Good luck!|`|XBTzRVuBaa	I suggest you speak with your doctor. You're going to get speeches, you opened a can of worms.     My personal opinion is 8 weeks is a bit young. My daughter had troubles digesting when I tried cereal at 4 months, so we waited until 6 months, the suggested age.     If he is spitting up a lot your doctor may suggest cereal, but this is something that should be addressed with a professional.     I was up every 2-3 hours for the first 5 months of my daughters life. Its part of motherhood, I'm sorry to have to tell you that one.|`|OPloDbxvaa	my son was about 3 months when we started (ped order), but we started in the morning first just one baby spoon a tsp is too much at first just to see if theres no bad reaction you gotta do it in the morning ,but not allo babies are a like my son was hungry 6 oz every 2 hours (bottle fed) and he was 13lbs born almost 10lbs, but the thing is if you baby spits up alot and is crying all the time maybe it's acid reflux and he is not hungry because 5oz every 2 hours is alot and he wants it becaue it eases the pain , try outting him to sleep elevated   and after every feeding keep him up right for a little while , and talk about it to your doc       good luck        p.s thanks for the thumbs down... lmao|`|P2hhUsoMaa	I wouldn't do it.  I just started giving my son cereal at 4 months. I got one of those snuggly blankets that hold babies arms inside it and close to them and started putting him in it at 4 weeks and he sleeps from 8:30 at night till 6 or 7 am.  I know every baby is different, but I swear by it for my son.  I was thinking about not putting him in it anymore and I tried 3 nights ago and he woke up every 3 hours to eat like during the day.  I ONLY put it on him at night at bedtime too.  Not for naps or anything else.  That way he knows the routine and he knows it means bedtime.  My son is almost outgrowing his so I'm hoping they have them in bigger sizes.  Good luck with your little one!  You should give the snuggly blanket a try and see if it works for you.  I don't know if that's what its called.  But if your interested email me and I will send you a pic.|`|5DJcir9saa	8 weeks seems a little young to me, but I know my mom said that when we were young cereal was given at an early age.  I would speak to your doctor and see if he has any suggestions.  My only concern is that he is spitting up a lot.  Maybe he's eating too much at once, which causes him to spit up, have an upset belly and be cranky.  But at 8 weeks, it is expected to be up every 2-3 hours for feedings.|`|qStmw7qgaa	I was feeding my 8 week old a lot too for a while and she would get really cranky and spit up a lot.  It turned out that I was actually over feeding her.  I started giving her just 2 1/2 ounces every 2 hours and the spit up and crankiness stopped, she didn't act hungry after, and then she started sleeping through the night.  She let me know when she was ready for 3 ounces because she started acting hungry after I took the bottle away.  But that is just me.  It also depends on how big your baby is.    I don't think I would feed the baby rice cereal though.  Seems too young.  Talk to your dr.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	A full tummy does NOT make a baby sleep longer-That's an old wives tale. Just make sure your baby is getting enough to eat through out the day. At 8 weeks it's to be expected that a baby would be waking at night. Don't bother with the cereal :)|`|5rFua92paa	My 4 month old is still not on cereal...my mother in law pushed me to start her at 8 weeks but that is just a little too soon (in my totally non nedically trained opinion! ). The best advise I can give you is to ask your doctor. I just know that my little one is still satisfied by her formula (I couldn't bf for medical reasons) so there is no need to start solids just yet. She started sleeping through the night at about 10-12 weeks on her own...no cereal needed! Just let that little body adjust and chances are sleep filled nights are just around the corner!I just know they aren't little forever so I try not to rush mine to grow up too fast!! Good luck!|`|mZjdxuweaa	My son is 8 weeks old too and he also has a spit up problem and when I took him to the doctor he old me to put a teaspoon of cereal for every oz of water in his bottle and it helped me out and him alot!    My son a reflux problem too so it alo helped keep it down, didnt really help him sleep any longer tho... sorry|`|YW72TLapaa	I started giving my son rice cereal at about 4 weeks with the pedi permission (in his bottle!).  i think it depends on how much he weighs. but not to dissapoint you, it doesnt help make them sleep through the night. The doc said put one teaspoon per 2 oz of milk and i did and nothing he still wakes up every two hours, the rice cereal made him very constipated.   He will sleep through the night when he is ready to, not when we want, my son is 2 1/2 months and sometimes he sleeps 4 or 5 hrs straight and some nights he wakes up every two hrs.  i too work  8 hrs a day and cant nap during the day but there is nothing you can do to make him sleep longer at nights.   my son only drinks 4 oz of formula every 2 hrs.   a week ago i changed the rice cereal to Oatmeal and that has helped to keep his BM normal.  The cereal does help keep them more full.   It all depends on your pedi, if he /she is the kind that follow the book they wont allow you to give him cereal until 4 months but like i said it depends on you and your pedi.   If i were you i woudl start adding just a teaspoon of cereal in his 5oz of milk, then a few days increase it a little maybe 1 1/2 teaspoon and so on.  i dont know if you should give it to him on a spoon though.... ithink he is too small and might choke... just my opinion.. btw.. i have a 15yr old daughter and i too started her on cereal at 4weeks.
S6tRZlKAaa	'x' is not a part of the japanese language...  Please do a little research into the name, just so you're sure =)  Some japanese GIRL  names I like are:  Yuki, Yukiko, Yumiko, Yuna, Yomi..

2isbOuRhaa	i really cant give much input on the miscarriage part, (ive never had one and im not too familiar with it) but your doctor should be able to determine that. and based on all of your information, i would say your ex is definitely the father. the dates with the other guy just dont match up..    im due June 27th (not long after you), and my date of conception (when i got pregnant) was October 4th. now since your due 2 weeks before me, subtract 2 weeks from the day i got pregnant on october 4th, and your looking around sometime in the middle of september...    having sex that soon after your bleeding (miscarriage or not), its pretty unlikely you got pregnant on that day... and ultrasounds are pretty accurate at due dates and youve had 3 already, so im definitely going with the ex.    good luck and congrats!        EDIT: dont listen to the people on here. they arent in your shoes. you didnt know you were pregnant when you were out partying, and if you did know, im sure you wouldnt have been doing it.. and love makes you do crazy things. ive been there, dating one guy when my ex came back into the picture. how the hell did you know he was going to come back around?... just dont worry what other people say. your on the right track and happy now. just do whats right for you and your baby, thats all that matters now! good luck hun!|`|FLOjzbKEaa	I am sorry about you.

With a miscarriage comes PAIN and lots and lots of bleeding (believe it or not more than what you've experienced).   Perhaps your period was whacky due to the fact you stopped BC for like 4 days and restarted it, which would throw off your ovulation days.   If your Due date via u/s says June 14th then it's normally pretty close..esp. early on one's.   And you also said your LMP was Sept. 7th then that has to be correct - you did say you had sex "right when you stopped bleeding" which means you still bled to that point, hence that WAS your period.   It looks like guy  1 is daddy, no doubt about it.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	How about next time you don't open your legs to just anyone? And if you ARE pregnant, please either get an abortion or  give it up for adoption. "Anywho..I was smoking, drinking and on birth control.

It sounds like you've already done that, so maybe he just needs time to "grieve" it out for himself.      He needs to foster a good relationship with his daughter that does not contradict the parental relationship she has with her grandparents. If he continues to do this, one day she will be old enough to ask questions and as long as he's honest she will understand. She will understand that he did it for her. As long as he does everything to make sure she doesn't go without (financially and emotionally), it is not likely for her to harbor ill feelings.|`|I6w6Nrphaa	Parents do it everyday when they drop their children, even newborns, off at daycare everyday, for 8 or more hours a day, 5 days a week.
5ptEGE5haa	HI, I GOT ONE USED, WORKED GREAT,FROM THE FIRST CYLCE I USED IT.   YOU CAN RESET THE MONITORS VERY EASILY  GO TO THIS WEBSITE, IT WILL TELL U WHAT TO DO :)  www.ehow.com/how_2326261_reset-clearbl...|`|H74F8jxuaa	I bought my monitor the beginning of January this year.  I have used this month only and got my two peak days.  A lot of people say that usually the first month you only have high days and I got high and peak days.  If you buy a new one, they will know your cycle only.  It is true that it takes the monitor several months to get used to your cycle because every woman is different and has different levels of hormones.  As far as the sticks go, unless you piss all over it, you won't have to worry about the bacteria on it because you pee on one end of it, take the cap off the other end and cover the part you pee on.  It is totally enclosed and you shouldn't get pee everywhere.  I bought my monitor on ebay for 139.99 with 30 sticks and free shipping.  A really good deal considering they are 189.99 for monitors, 49.99 for 30 sticks and shipping if you buy them online or gas driving to the store.  I highly recommend the monitor, but something else that will help you with your cycles is charting (if you don't already do that).  You will be able to get real close to your ovulation and can have sex at the time of your peak fertility.  Best of luck and I hope this helped!!|`|QCYad4jUaa	Get a new monitor.

7C9Ett7Caa	Let me tell you a short story: I was about 7 or 8 weeks pregnant. I was having constant really bad cramps. Like I was on my period, but worst. I thought for sure I was having a miscarrage.. But, guess what, Im 36 1/2 weeks pregnant now!! So I would say, depending upon the women, anything could be normal.. But I will give you this advice: Dont stress yourself out, that will definately cause you to have a miscarrage. If something is bothering you to the point where your stressing, call your doctor and get some reassurance. I've had a miscarrage in the past from stress, so im telling you from experience to relax and do not stress. Good luck and congrats on the pregnancy!!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Its pretty normal to have period cramp around the time ur period was due.

He knows what he has to do to get the sticker for the day and I really play it up, reminding him of what ever he ask for. There is always off days, but he has to get at least 25 stickers on the calendar in order to get his prize. It also has helped to make sure he is in bed at a decent time, get up early enough to eat some breakfast then get dressed. He is also better on the morning he showers first (not too much fun to run around naked in the cold). His worse days are Mondays after a visit to grandma and grandpa's. Probably from being overly tired and out of routine.    Now if only I can get the 14 year olds to get up and get ready like they are suppose to.|`|PLOtLEeXaa	maybe you could make it a game...like who ever dresses first gets a piece of candy, or if you don't want to use candy you could maybe let them watch more of a television program they really like that night.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Whenever my kids are distracted like that, I'll sit down & help them focus by telling them, step by step, what to do next (and doing it for them, if necessary).      If they're distracting each other, have you tried separating them when it's time to get dressed?  One in the bathroom, one in the bedroom, maybe?|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Leaving their clothing out the night before and making lunches night before reduces time and energy. Don't ASK them =tell them to put their stuff on. Sit there in the room until they do it. Force them if they have to. Who is the boss?|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	I had to keep the TV off and put my son through what we called boot camp at that age. That way it was kind of a game-he took FOREVER to get dressed and was distracted too. It was up-make your bed- come have breakfast-brush your teeth and get dressed-we used to pick out clothes the night before etc. Same thing every morn to get him in the routine--it did work though. I even made him march down the hall-he liked that. You can hand out citations or stars too....|`|AA11755924	I know the feeling!  I have 3 kids and every morning we have the same battle.  Especially my 8 year old.  He gets sooo distracted - I wake him up in the morning and tell him to get in the shower and then brush his teeth.  25 minutes later I go to check on him and he's just standing in the shower, playing.  So I remind him, "Jayden, it's time to get out, you still need to brush your teeth."  So he gets out and 10 minutes later I check on him and he's sitting there on the floor of the bathroom with the towel wrapped around him and he's just sitting there!  By this time I'm a little upset, b/c I'm trying to get myself ready for work as well.  Again, I tell him to brush his teeth and then get your clothes on.  It is an ongoing battle every morning.  The only thing I've been able to do is wake him up earlier so he can take a longer shower and I just have to stay on top of him every 10 minutes or so I'll go check on him and see what he's doing to get ready.  He also gets distracted by his little 4 yr old brother who wants him to "Come see what's on TV!  Look at this!"  So of course he doesn't want to get ready for school when his brother is telling him to watch TV!!  keep it up and good work!  I know it's tough.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	Stand right in front of both of them w/ their clothes.  Don't let them leave your sight.  Give one direction at a time to both of them such as 'put your socks on', then move on to 'ok, put your pants on'.  If they start to get distracted standing there, redirect them back to the task.  No TV while doing this, no distractions such as pets in the room, etc....   At that age they are too young for you to yell from the bathroom 'get dressed, your clothes are on your bed' or whatever.  That does not even work w/ my 8 year old.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Stand over them...that helps.  Or take away a better breakfast...or lunch.   I add a special snack if they are dressed in time.   I also keep the tv off. I almost stand over them..  Sometimes I get frustrated and cry. That actually worked a couple of times. Can't use it much though. My kids are sweet, BUT they are kids.   They are 13 (he is gone when they are getting ready), 10, 8, and 6.   My 8 year old pretends to shower too. Not sure why he hates being clean. :)  He will even dampen his hair and wrap up in a towel.   Offer rewards. A few minutes of cartoons if they are dressed by a certain time. A bigger snack. Or breakfast. Extra playtime.   Another story.|`|jsMhfnRQaa	Turn tv off! and try making it fun! see who is fastest!  good luck hope this will help you? xx|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	have them pick out their clothes the night before. Give them a time limit and try to keep checking on them. Tell them breakfast may not happen if they dont hurry up, or tell them they will have to get up earlier if they cant hurry and get dressed. Maybe promise them a little prize. Stickers or a special breakfast if they hurry|`|DiQ0fIdlaa	You Need to tell them they have 10 Minutes to get dressed or their going with what they got on.It may be hard for you to let them go in their jam'ies but it's called tough love. They need to learn that They need to listen to you.It works great for me. I'm not a mom But i babysit a lot.  Let me know if this works for ya.|`|ykrJB3NGaa	Try bathing them at night and putting a clean t-shirt on to sleep in that can be worn the next day.  Then all that needs to be changed in the morning is from pajama bottoms to underpants and jeans, and a shirt added over the t-shirt.  As much as possible avoid buttons, snaps, zippers, etc. and stick with pullover/pull-on clothes.  Velcro shoes are great for rushed mornings, as long as you have the laced shoes as well for teaching them to tie when there's more time.    Most of all, enjoy that 30 minutes.  Arrange your schedule, start earlier or whatever it takes so that you have that time with your boys and make it fun.  Play music, make up songs about putting on clothes, etc.  Your little boys have to be away from you all day, and they might be just asking for more mommy-time.  Give it to them.    My two boys are now in their twenties, and thinking back I appreciate how precious those times with them really were.  Don't miss it.
ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	i think its funny  but its cool, no big deal|`|YYAu9lFDaa	it's only a problem if you LET it be a problem.    tell your friends to STFU, i bet they're single aren't they?|`|HurPmgSaaa	That's kind of funny.  You guys need nicknames!|`|T7uFoSUQaa	I think it's irony at its best! It shouldn't be a problem unless you make it a problem. Do either of you have a full name or a nickname you can go by?|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	they only make fun because they see that it bothers you. its a natural reaction . so if you guys dont show them it bothers you they will stop|`|7SKVCPcSaa	as long as you aren't related its fine.    but if you do get married, make sure you drop your median name..  you dont' want to be jamie mccormack mccormack. lol    but no. as long as you KNOW you aren't related, its fine.|`|dPULl5hjaa	it's very petty for someone to comment on your names.    why not call your bf - Jay instead of Jaime|`|koTI0lsMaa	one of you pick a nickname|`|wi6mkT30aa	I actually think it's really adorable! I wouldn't let that get to you at all, I would be proud of it. There isn't anything you can do about it, and that's who you two are, let it show and don't be uncomforable about it or think it's a problem because it's not! =)    I think i'ts cute! :D|`|614d9c4d7bb2ebab6d73ea0000065cfeaa	its not a big deal my friends parents were jean and gene   as long as you can identify who is who the who cares. my best friend and i are both alissa's but we can separate who is talking to who that's what i mean by separate. best of luck j&j|`|mCDopsLEaa	I think its very cute!!! They are probably just fascinated by the coincidence. Don't bother with them. It's and you and Jamie!! :)|`|zXSjBHAAaa	Thats funny and weird!
MkCTwE95aa	i am only 30 weeks and the muscles on the inside of my thigh KILL!! its probably just from the extra weight you are carrying around and they haven't really had a chance to relax. If you think about your muscles after a workout they usually hurt for about 2 days but feel better because they are given time to adjust, when your pregnant there is no time to adjust and there is more strain put on your legs everyday. thats what i attribute to my sore mucles anyways.|`|KrkftOfkaa	That and your center of gravity is shifting.  Probably a lot more noticably now than previously.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes at that far along in your pregnancy and hormone called relaxin is being released to help your pelvic bones spread apart so you can give birth so that pain is normal.|`|eIx8ONbLaa	I have the same problem.   Started when I was 36 weeks.   Still have it and I am almost 38 weeks.   I think Its just your body getting ready for the baby.
4gZYucHMaa	A tradition that I started that my family did not, is to have a keepsake box, my parents as soon as I moved out, threw away anything and everything.    For my kids I have their first pics, first letters they've written (alphabet), their first quilt for the crib, first toy etc plus I wrote a journal while I was pregnant (and what a journey it was with my last born), wrote down all my fears, joys and thoughts of them and my wishes for them for the future. I always wished I'd had something handed down in my family and bc I didn't I wanted to start it now.    Another tradition is every xmas eve, we have a big feast of homemade hor'deuves, appetizers, treats and cookies that I start making at noon and we eat all day long, listen to xmas music and watch movies as well play games---the kids look forward to that as much as the big day.    edit--actually so do we :)  I always wanted decos for the tree to have passed down...my husbands family does that, we've done the same thing--bought a special ornament that reflects what they're like or who they are like or what they're into --I did the journal bc I want my kids to think of me as ''human''---it's something that I lacked seeing in my parents, making mistakes and owning upto them etc.|`|dcd11iUwaa	we have a lot of xmas traditions that stem from back home in australia.   i make ice cream Christmas cake and have a bbq and go to the beach.  Its nice having something from back home to bring to a new country.|`|Dnr0Wbn3aa	Well , I'm not a parent yet ( I'm 19 weeks pregnant ). My boyfriend and I don't actually have any family traditions, But we want to implement some.. ie create new ones ! Some of the traditions we want to have are:   1. going out as a family every year to cut down an xmas tree  2. decorating the Christmas tree together  3. creating a special holiday that is just our family and no one else that happens once a year , like , Rivera Lobster Fest ! or something like that ...   4. Celebrate ethnic holidays like st pattys day and teaching the kids about their heritage .. with food and culture|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	We make sure the majority of our cultural/religious traditions have been carried on through our family - it's been important to us, and now they are important to this next generation.|`|AA11210211	well on my side of the family we don't have any my family really isn't very family oriented so there are none from there,on my hubby's side there are a few like the night before christmas they read christmas stories to all the kids,for halloween my MIL makes a bunch of finger foods and she lets the kids name them whatever they want like mini corn dogs would be frankin fingers grapes would be eyeballs!!! It is so cute,I plan to carry that one on.With my daughter I plan to make a Hope chest and have her give it to her daughter or DIL and then her daughter and so and so on.
AA12238733	Hell no, each child needs there own unique Identity.  I've always thought having names all start with same letter, or having them rhyme, or having all of them similar (IE: Melody, Melinda, Melanie, Melvin, Melbourne, Meldrick) was very stupid, selfish, and unfair to the children.|`|Ig35GCyMaa	thats pretty much what everyone does when they have a LOT of kids|`|tmYLGbNLaa	If I did name them with all the same letter I would mix them up a lot.|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Thats a lot of kids but i would consider it.  Its cute.|`|O0dIRvAgaa	your children would curse their very existence.|`|wQucJZRCaa	No, but I would do the alphabet thing ...       A - Amy  B - Brannen  C - Caitlyn  D - Daniel  E - Evangeline  F - Frankie  G - Gillian  H - Hunter  I - Ian  J - James    Those are not my name choices, they are just names that popped in my head real quick!|`|qxnxm0YLaa	I am a BIG FAN of families having the same first and last initials! That's what my Husband & I plan to do when we start having kids. The girls will all have "S" names like me and the boys' names will start with an "E" like my hubby!  SUPER CUTE...like the Kardashians! (lol)|`|RnS7uVIGaa	No way, I would pick them all different initials, I am a twin and our mom gave us the same initials, and once he got my award for community service.|`|X3TLm1Mmaa	No|`|rnZlo7Ccaa	no i think its too boring i would name my kids:  Sophie  Liam  Leah  Ryan  Payton  Shaun  Ava  John  Emily  Sam [ boy]|`|DkwgogXZaa	that's a bit extreme|`|DZB0WCmmaa	no!|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	I wouldnt|`|TAIlyvgyaa	Only if I was naming charaters in a cheesy sitcom.|`|dPULl5hjaa	NO way!    Maybe they name their kids of J because it's easier for them to remember.  who knows.....and who cares|`|CMuL7XpKaa	no|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	I wouldn't but my brother-in-law's parents did:  Roger  Randy  Robert  Raymond  etc|`|T7uFoSUQaa	Honestly, with the Duggars, I dont think they thought they would ever have 18 children. I think maybe they figured on 5 kids where the same letter-first name is cute and not as difficult. But once they got to a certain point, they couldn't discontinue the pattern. Why not keep going?    I think its cute if the names are stupid.|`|aJu53IX4aa	No, I would not do that.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	no but i would consider giving some away|`|ace1da8d9697bcba6a616faa6d80b4b0aa	Only if I actually like the names.  Made up names get to weird just to keep in the same vein...|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I personally wouldn't, but my fiance and his siblings all start with A.  Aaron   Anthony  Alisha  Anna  Alauna    I call my kids by the wrong names now, and they start with different letters (and ones a boy, ones a girl). If mine all started with the same letter I would never be able to keep them straight.|`|TBbhmZEwaa	my grandparents almost did that but they stopped after the second cuz it started getting a little weird. they used E. Eric, Emily.|`|ttxxBuODaa	I'd probably do that, cause hey. It confuse me if i named them with different letters. I have a brother named Joshuah. A friend named Jeremiah.|`|rroE37HTaa	The Duggers are such an amazing family..to have the faith and the love that they have!   I think their name choices are wonderful, and kind of a cement for their commitment to their family. Besides that they can pass down monogrammed clothing! lol|`|d0e1b5b2af884d02c8c1a86fcdf900caaa	It would be too hard for me to find 10 names that I love that all start with the same letter.|`|qGQCLFinaa	I might use two different letters :) That would get too confusing, but i think it's cute, a LOT of people on my dad's side have a name starting in J.....|`|sW8VQy4Qaa	Well it depends.. My friend Kayla her family has a tradition where all the kids did that her dad had 12 siblings all with the letter M But theres also a disorder that people have who do that.|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	I think that is so ridicolus they will have all the names gone by the time they finish having kids.    They sound too alike  ex: Johanna, Joanna, Joy-Anna  Jeremiah, Jedidiah  too ewwww....|`|yCjTBYAEaa	My uncle has 5 kids (with another on the way) and they all have names that start with G and the same middle name.  Grant  Garret   Gavin  Gage  Gannon  G?????|`|MHIRaIfsaa	dude i would not that just wouldent be that great because you would just be naming them with names all starting with the same thing.    that is not cool you would just do that so you can remember there name thats just not cool.     so why dont you just pic there names and make it something you would like and not so you can just remember who is who. =)|`|mCDopsLEaa	i have two so far. Brenden and Bryson and if I get a girl as I am hoping she will be named Brianne|`|MSGixNibaa	No, it's silly. I come from a matchy sibling set and I didn't find anything special about it. I'd rather my kids have their own identity than be "one of the Duggar's J kids".|`|FvYqKZSMaa	It depends on the names.|`|IvkNTqDMaa	No, that's stupid.|`|ukFI400eaa	I'd never do that.|`|nOzQUsToaa	No, I wouldn't. Not even for multiples.|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	No i think thats tacky and confusing|`|xLPB0Z2maa	Sorry but no!    I would name them:    Kaylee Grace- girl  Dylan Matthew- boy  Alexis Genevieve- girl  Aiden Lucas- boy  Aleah Naomi- girl  Michael David- boy  Keegan Rylee- boy  Peyton Lisa- girl  Rylan Joseph- boy  Hannah Kate- girl
VS8mactUaa	They reccommended me to get a d&c, and some meds but I opted to do it on my own. I passes everything about 3 days later and all was perfect! Good Luck to you!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If you don't take them ideally your body will push the products of conception out in 2-3 weeks on it's own.  When I did this a week ago (at roughly 11 weeks) it wasn't too terrible, I woke up with bad cramps, lots of blood (but not the soaking a pad every hour for 4 hours which sends you to the ER), and after 3 hours I passed something and felt a whole heck of a lot better.   Since then I've had the normal menstrual cramps.    The biggest thing about waiting is that you're waiting, which is harder then the actual process I think.   In a lot of ways it would have been nice to get it on the road, I could not use Cytotec due to a previous c-section (they don't like to use medical means after c-sections, surgical was an option).   It's up to you, with the medical manner it would be over in about 12 hours, sometimes longer but not that often.   Or you can wait for your body to do it's thing too.|`|v3LnJycKaa	cytotec basically is an synthetic semen like hormone that softens and dilates the cervix, can cause contractions, it will help to flush your uterus out.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	My doctor told me I should get a D&C because otherwise you may not get completely cleaned out and can get a serious infection.  I wouldn't take the pills, but I didn't want to wait to naturally miscarry either and may have to get a D&C in the end anyway.  So I don't know how the pills will make you feel, but I know that after having a D&C I had a huge weight lifted off my shoulders because I knew that I was completely cleaned out and didn't have to play the waiting game.
dfizAfGQaa	I understand your son more then ever because my parents splat up when i was about his age.My mom and dad had friendly relationship and my father payed us money even though  he didn't have to.Now my father is in a totally different country on a totally different continent.I think that you should talk to your ex husband, and tell him that right now his child needs him more then ever and i think that if you and your ex husband make friends just for a kid it would be great.From my point of view,a normal father should see his son AT LEAST 10 times a month and on weekends and school breaks, he should take him to his house.  i really hope i helped because i've been in same situation as your son and i feel bad for him.=]|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	The only advice I can think to give you is to start living in reality & helping your son to do the same.  You can't change dad.  You can change how you view dad in your home, though.      No, that doesn't mean you need to tell your son that dad is not reliable, is no good.  Your son clearly loves his father and, you clearly think that his father has a positive place in his life.  That is good & you should keep that.  But, you do both need to get realistic about the role that dad is currently playing in his life.      Start telling your son that dad lives far away, now.  If he asks 'why', let him know that dad decided that was best for him, for his job, for his life.  If he doesn't understand the concept of 'far away', explain it to him.  Show him a map.  Talk about how long it takes to travel that far (use increments he knows like '10 episodes of Diego' instead of '5 hours').  Let him know that dad still loves him, but has other things that he needs to do right now, too.  Let him be happy when dad does come, but don't build him up for disappointment when you are not certain that he is coming.      Most of all, let him know, that you & he will be fine - that you've got him covered, until dad straightens out his life enough to start spending more time with him.|`|gli7SbBoaa	My fiance lives away form his daughter, she lives with his parents, but if he can he makes a point of going over at least once a week now.  It used to be that he would only see her once or twice a month but he has his reasons.  Of course our career is quite demanding and sometimes he couldn't see her for months.  If he can't make it he at least calls to check on her, even if it's just asking her grandparents how she is.      If he won't come over call him.  Tell him his son needs him and that the least he could do would be talk to him over the phone.  Just because he's engaged doesn't mean he doesn't have a son.

F8iyUqJBaa	I wouldn't look to the stars for your answer sweetie. God is the giver of life, not His creation.  I also have my baby girl die inside of me at 28 weeks.  She tied her cord in a knot and they had to induce her.  I was devastated and depressed, but God blessed me with a son almost immediately after.  She died in 2002, he was born in 2003 and to this date I have 3 sons and another one due in May.  I understand how you feel, I was suffering greatly from empty arms, they call it "empty cradle syndrome".  All I wanted was a baby, but God provided.  He will for you too.

AA10972821	I had our second child 5 months ago (only 2 years after the first one) and wanted to get a tubal.  My husband convinced me to go with the Mirena instead and I agreed because I was also scared about it being so permanent. Now, however, I wish that I had had the tubal done and gotten it over with!  Two kids that are in diapers is exhausting and I couldn't even imagine adding a third to the mix at any time!  I have known dozens of women over the years that have had the tubal ligation done and about 98% have been very happy with it- the two exceptions are my aunt and a friend's mom who both somehow got pregnant again YEARS later.  As far as other birth controls, the only sure-fire way to not get pregnant again is abstinence, which I think probably won't work when you're married, so look over all your options and talk to your doctor about it- they will have an unbiased opinion!|`|rKJQIaCdaa	Don't do it if you have reservations about it. It's expensive to have reversed, and it's not always successful. I had one and have had regrets.  I would recommend and IUD  (it's pretty much a sure thing, and you don't have to worry about forgetting a pill and having an "oops!"  )  Also you should consider getting him a vasectomy b/c it's easier to reverse if you change your mind.  (Since he's the one so adamant about it that's what i would suggest if you want something more permanent)       You're smart to worry about how many children you can actually afford to have!  I get aggravated by people that have lots of kids and just get more and more help from the state.   I stopped at one because of our financial situation at the time.   We're in better shape now, and are re-evaluating.|`|AA11451786	i had mine done at 23.  30 years later , i don't think i've ever regretted it however if it's him that doesn't want any more by all means he should get fixed|`|QufZeqlVaa	im on the same position as you are.. pregnant 5 1/2 this will be my 3rd child. i always think what  later on in a few years me and my husband split and  waht about if he finds another woman and gets her pregnant . later on i want more children im not gona be able anymore while he is .|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	After my second child I had my tubes "Clipped Tied and Burned" thinking that I would be with my husband for the rest of my life and I did not want to have another child...2 years later we were divorced and I married the love of my life 2 years after that.  My current husband does not have any children of his own and wanted one really bad, so I had a tubal reversal.  That was pretty expensive but well worth it.  My advice to you is...not to have a tubal ligation!  After my tubal ligation, my periods were horrible...the bleeding was heavier, the cramps were very painful, and my periods lasted usually 10 or 11 days as opposed to 6 to 8.  Since the reversal, my periods are back the way they were before the ligation and I could not be happier.  If your husband is all for you getting a tubal ligation and you are having second thoughts, talk to him about getting a visectomy.  It is cheaper, safer, an outpatient operation and makes a lot more sense.  Though I was headstrong and knew I wanted a tubal ligation at 25, now that I am 31 I really wish I had never had it done.  Luckily I was able to get it reversed!  Good Luck with your decision!!!|`|vue9NOhYaa	If you aren't sure, then wait.  There are many birth control methods that are VERY effective, but are reversible if you should change your mind.  You might, for example, talk to your GYN about the Mirena -- it's an IUD, well over 99% effective, and is good for 5 years. Nothing to do, or take or think about once it's in place.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	One thing I strongly believe in is "Never sacrifice the permanent on the alter of the immediate".  Your situation CURRENTLY is that you can't afford or don't want anymore children.  But you don't know what will happen in the future.  I have a friend who had four children and swore she was done so she had a tubal.  Now it's been 5 years since the last one and she longs for another.  She's been searching high and low for someone to reverse the tubal but they botched it so bad no one will do it.  I have another friend who was duped into c-sections by a lazy doctor and after a few he tied her tubes and told her no more.  She has been devastated ever since, she really wants more.  I suggest you don't surgically alter your body, just hold out for several years and see how you feel then.  It's amazing what a mothers instinct and desire does to us over the years of raising our precious angels.|`|mY19PPlIaa	I personally would reccomend you not to do tubal. Just use double birth control to cover your bases. Such as a combo of birth control pills and spermicide. I also think why do you have to get your tubes tied? its so much safer for a man to have a vasectomy, if you ask me your husband should be the one getting fixed, not you.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	My fiance wants me get one but I refuse. This will be our 3rd child and even though I don't want anymore and we certainly can't afford anymore it's just not something I am willing to do. For starters I am not married and even though we have been together 9 years there is still no guarantee, I may marry a different man 10 years down the line that wants a kid (although I would never say this to my fiance) and secondly I am only 25 what if I really want a baby in 7 years (i doubt it, but you never know) there will be nothing I can do about it. What if I win the lottery, then I wouldn't be opposed to having more kids. Honestly I think your really young to make that decision now. Why don't you try something like the minera that will work for 5 years and then if you still really have no interest in having any more you can get it done then. Personally though, I'm a fan of getting the man fixed. That's what I'm pushing for. It's easier (an outpatient procedure), cheaper, and can be reversed. If your second guessing it I wouldn't right away, you may end up regretting it later.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Hi hun!.  I had my tubes tied when I was 22.  I was in the same situation as you.  I had my 2nd child and was convinced by my husband that a tubal was what we needed to do.  I hate to say it but life changes and people change.  We wound up breaking up the same year.  Which was something I thought would never happen.  Soon after I met the man of my dreams.  I am now 30 and want more than anything to have a child.  I am now saving up for a reversal which is $6,200.00 and there is no guarantee I will ever become pregnant.  If you are having any sort of second thought then DON'T DO IT!  It was the biggest mistake of my life!  I recently joined a tubal reversal group on Ya! and you would not believe the number of women like myself who are upset and hoping for a reversal.  One other thing to consider is Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome.  I never heard of it before I had my surgery.  Research it and see if you are willing to live with all of these things.  It does not affect all women but it did affect me.  If you are having a hard time convincing your husband that you shouldn't have the procedure you have an option.  Statistics show that women who have a tubal immediately after child birth have a higher failure rate.  Meaning their tubes are most likely to grow back together.  If that happens you have a higher chance of an ectopic pregnancy which can kill you.  Tell him an IUD will keep you from becoming pregnant for 5 years and after that you will decide wether or not to have the surgery.  I wanted you to know my experience so hopefully you make the right choice.  I pray every day that some miracle will happen and I will become pregnant.  It breaks my heart that I can not have a child because of something I did to myself.  Here is a link to a post tubal ligation syndrome website.  http://members.tripod.com/~sterilization...  If you have any questions feel free to email me.  Good luck hun!|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	i know of 2 ladys who have had it done and have had many problems. repet dnc's one had a historectomey at 40 years old. The other is wanted another child and has horrible problems with here period. so there are things like merina that both of my sisters use and are wonderful with no problems.. i would consider that first.. your so young|`|P2hhUsoMaa	I considered it also while pregnant with my second at 25.  But I kept having second thoughts also.  And everyones advice to me was "Don't do it if you have any doubts!"  It's alot harder to reverse it for a woman if you would ever change your mind.  Have your husband get it done because I heard it's less painful and it's easier to reverse if need be.  I didn't end up getting it done I got on Mirena instead since it's good for 5 years.  Good Luck!|`|IVSqQQzlaa	I think 24 is too young to have a tubal.  Your financial situation will no doubt have improved by the time you hit your 30's and what you want at 24 may be very different from what you want at 30 or 35.  You don't want to have any regrets or to have to spend a lot of money on a reversal that may or may not work.  I know several people who have done reversals because they changed their minds and often it doesn't work.    I hate to be really negative but I would also point out that the divorce rate is over 50% and I know lots of people who went on to second marriages where they wanted to have more children with their new partner.    I also have friends who swear having a tubal screwed up their periods and caused all kinds of problems with pain etc.  That was enough to prevent me from getting one.  Personally I think the man should get a vasectomy anyway.  It is far easier and less invasive.  These days they do "non-surgical" vasectomies.    I would recomend you give it some time before you make such an important decision.  The fact that you are hesitating is a very good indication that you shouldn't be going ahead with it.|`|nbSp469Waa	I'm like you, I'm scared to have one.  I have 1 boy and 2 girls.  My son is the oldest, when I was doing all my prenatal work up I signed the paper to get my tubes tied, and after I delivered my doctor told me to call her office the next day to schedule the tubal in 6 weeks.  (She waits 6 weeks after you deliver to ensure all tubes are back to normal), I had second thoughts and never went thru with it, 4 1/2 years later my husband and I decided we wanted to try for another one, and now I have her and am so happy that I didn't go thru with it.  I'm not trying to change your mind, but if you have any doubts AT ALL, don't do it, you don't want to spend the rest of your life regretting it.  If you husband is so hell bent about you getting it done, tell him that he should go get snipped, and see what his reaction is.  There are other ways that are not permanent to prevent pregnancy.  You never know, in 2 1/2 years you may want to try for another baby, your money situation can change to where you can afford a 3rd.|`|VzOokYEqaa	why don't you get a udi instead. you can keep them for 7 or 8 years and is as affective as getting your tubes tied. I recommend Mirena.
0td65n04aa	My daughter always had a hard time waiting in restaurants for the food to come so we invented tv remote.  My husband would pretend to have a tv remote and flip through the channels and she would act out the channel he said.  If she didn't really know the channel we would say a specific show.  I still remember the time he said animal planet and she did a Steve Irwin impression.  She had the entire restaurant rolling.      My son gets fussy in car rides so sometime we pretend that dinosaurs are chasing us and he has to save mommy.  It is funny the types of dinosaurs he knows and the fact that he exclaimed once, "Quick, hand me that bazooka!  It's a T-Rex!"  He's four so he relishes in being the hero.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I don't know that it "stimulate and grows"  my kids. lol  But we play broom ball when I really need a laugh.  Very simple concept.  Very simple game.  many laughs.  i get the broom out and start whacking a ball around the house.  my kids think it is the funniest thing in the world.  they go chase it and bring it back and i whack it some more.  its great exercise and many laughs.  we are a simple bunch.  :-)

wiAVa1H5aa	It's about your body getting ready to have that baby out of your body, some women's bodies tend to push things out - often either end - a few days before labor.   I tend to start spewing when I hit active labor, and not before - but that's me.   Probably you'll be there soon.|`|7C9Ett7Caa	You have less room for your stomach becuase your baby is taking up lotsa space, so your food is having trouble digesting. Im 36 weeks and I had the same problem last night. I thought I was going to throw up too. Good Luck!!|`|cV8etdJKaa	It is very normal.  It is a sign your baby is getting ready to come, and at 38 weeks, you are not considered too early.

Fresh pineapple contains the enzyme bromelain which is thought to help to soften the cervix and so bring on labour, but you would have to eat about seven whole pineapples for it to have any effect.    It HAS to be fresh because the bromelain is lost in the canning and juicing processes.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	its didnt work for me... sex worked for me|`|AA12064250	I polished off a whole fresh pineapple last week and at my last OB visit (Tuesday) I was already dilating.  So for me, maybe it is doing the trick.  So, I sent my husband out for another one yesterday...LOL    You can try it, it wont hurt anything.  I have heard that it does need to be a fresh pineapple though.    Good luck!!|`|m24hC0fraa	darn, proud momma bear beat me to it but i will strongly confirm what she said. if you really want to bring on the labor, have sex. that's the best thing to cause it to start.|`|eIx8ONbLaa	Pineapple is supposed to bring on labour.   But it has to be the actual fresh fruit.   Juice or canned pineapple wont work.   it has too many preservatives.

AA12221392	when my kids were younger I babysat other kids on a once in while basis, but nothing full time.  We had grilled cheese sandwiches and crackers, or we had mac n cheese and hot dogs, sometimes little pizza, or i would make bagel pizzas (they liked these).soup sometimes, it just really depend on the kids, and what thye liked.     I would make up activity books - i would make color sheets, and connect the dot sheets, shapes , ect and staple the whole book together. They would work on it by themselves, then we would do some together, and then I would read to them as well. Sometimes they would just play together with the toys. we had alot of ride on type toys (power wheels) so when we went outside they got to ride in these, bikes, play in the water sprinkler.     I also had tapes that were called silly kids songs- I turned it on and we would dance, sing, and kinda just run around acting silly.     Then we had tv time - were we watched seasme street , barney, other pbs type shows, like mister rogers ect. Then it was nap time. .    I charge about 1.50 per hour /kid no more than 3.00 for more than 2 kids. Most of the time it was my friends kids so i would charge them only small amounts, just to give our family alittle extra without taking advantage of my friends...|`|eDnWMm3maa	I was watching a little girl for $30 a day.

Your egg most likely wouldn't actually become fertlized until the 19th or 20th.  The day it became fertilized (i.e. the 19th or 20th) would be your date of conception.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	conception-when the egg is fertilized. When they are calculating your due date they tend not to go by coneception b.c there is no way to find out exactly when conception took place so they go by the start of ur last menses! GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wLe7nBLGaa	i think its when the egg is fertilized is considered conception and when it implants its cosidered implantation...i could be wrong but i think it sound right.|`|P42BmBudaa	im not sure but like with me i had unprotected sex Nov. 21st and my period came on 23rd and it lasted 2 days since then my breasts have been tender and i found out i was pregnant on Dec 24th but when i went to doct. they wrote that i conceived on the 7th of Dec. so i have no idea how that goes
SlBsJ3NRaa	It's within the average range for medium to big boned girls. I know, I'm 4'11 as well and my pre-pregnancy weight was 129. And your weight isn't bad, it's the media that says eat a carrot per year and you'll be hot. I'd rather be chunky and fed than skinny and starved. It shouldn't be about weight, it should be about health. Damn the media and their skeletal role models! But if it makes you feel better, certain celebrities were told to gain weight before even trying to conceive because they were too thin.    Edit: Yeah, it's stupid how the media is. Like anyone really cares if someone famous gains weight. They follow female celebs around and act all shocked like OMG, HERE'S A PICTURE OF JESSICA SIMPSON...AND SHE'S GAINED 15 lbs!     TYRA BANKS WAS CAUGHT IN A SHOPPING MALL TODAY...EATING! IT'S ATROCIOUS!     Those boring losers must have no lives to follow people around with a camera and harp on other peoples weight.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I agree with you and I am sure you are beautiful!  Society is sick and obsessed with youth and thinness.  As long as you are healthy and physically active, I don't see a problem.  I think we all have an optimum body weight and beyond a certain point, there's not much you can do to change it.    I have the opposite problem.  I am 5ft 6in and was 115lbs pre-pregnancy.  After my first baby, I lost ALOT of weight breastfeeding, I went down to 108lbs and decided to stop breastfeeding.  The sad part - everyone kept telling me how great I looked (guys mostly!  I had big boobs, which were only temporary by the way, and was thin!).  It used to really upset me because it seemed that they thought looking great was synonymous with being thin.  I do not want my daughter to grow up hearing that to look great you have to look anorexic.  It's not healthy.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I think its fine, no not heavy at all.  Get pregnant.  Don't put society's standards on yourself or you won't ever measure up.      Celebrities have different standards to measure up to.  Did you see the movie 'the devil wears prada' and Anne Hathaway was told as a size 6 that a size 6 is the new size 14?  Remember that these people have professional chefs, and unlimited bank account, plastic surgery, personal professional trainers ect.    Ave. women in America are a size 14, and I think that is beautiful.|`|EAzyjftKaa	I'm 5'1.5-5'2 and weight 145lbs. the doctor i was fine eventhough the  's said i should weigh 110-120 somewhere around there but i had a perfect pear shape so she said i was fine, know i'm really obesse i am a wopping 190  had mu IUD remove and started to loose wieght down 10lbs so far. I can't wait to get back to 145-160|`|DNygQdmVaa	as long as your happy with yourself.  im 5'4" and weigh about 157.    I use to weigh about 140 but.  I gained alot whrn i was pregnant with my son and i never lost it all.    Theres nothing wrong with being a little chubby as long as it diesnt afftect your health.
AA11185897	It is very unlikely :(    this site is awesome tho it tells you when your best chances are for pregnancy and best chances for boy and girl :)    http://www.babyhopes.com    You do need to know the length of your cycle. You can put the information in and it will tell ya what you want to know. It's in the Ovulation Calendar.|`|010e45dc0e6346ff817fa3cf9c7d3649aa	If your cycle is 28 days it is very unlikely you are pregnant at all as you would have ovulated on the 11th January.
DNygQdmVaa	my sons took about 2 weeks to come all the way through.    And he got a 2nd one like a week after the 1st.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I asked this a few weeks ago when Jacob's broke through. It's been about 3 weeks and it shows more and more every week but still isn't all the way in.|`|FplTPoAyaa	My daughter's took a week to ten days to come all the way through.|`|pXSKSS3daa	With my son it's usually 2-4 weeks, depending on WHAT tooth it is.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	My 8 month old broke a tooth through last week and it isn't even half way up yet. So it can take a while. =)
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	I have never taken clomid, But I have read on here about plenty of women who have so I thought I would respond :).  Just because your first round wasn't successful that doesn't mean this one won't.  You have to stay positive.  I know people hate hearing this, but the more relaxed and stress free you are the easier it will be to get pregnant.  I know, trust  me, easier said than done.  Just do the best you can hun. It'll happen when your body thinks you are ready.|`|S5n5Za78aa	i know exacally how you feel i ask this quest to give me hope too like every other day, but i did find it really helpfull to search for success stories from people who already ask the question and got lots of answers in the little green bar above "search for questions" and then i read about people like you and me that had ask this question and look back into there profile and about 95% of the people i looked up had concieved off of the clomid and they had been the same ones initially asking this question about losing hope from clomid!!   so dont loose hope !!!! wish you  the best and me too and all ttc :)|`|3MDY29gnaa	Hun its all in Gods Hands. He will bless you! Please just calm down! It will happen for you!|`|0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	Aww, I understand how u feel. My first round of clomid was 50 mg and I didnt ovulate, so I took 100 mg last month and yesterday I found that I'm pregnant after 8 months of TTC. So dont give up and keep hoping and praying.|`|304ef3a00356e988a8cd661bcf96f680aa	Actually, I got pregnant on my 2nd cycle of Clomid; however, I miscarried the baby at 6 weeks. So there is hope. Getting pregnant on the 2nd cycle of Clomid is very unusual though. My fertility doctor was quite shocked that I even got pregnant the 2nd cycle. She told me that normally it take awhile for Clomid to get in your system and start working.  Good luck!  I hope and pray that you will get your miracle soon!

Well I'm automatically against Sania as it reminds me of Sarnia which means Guernsey in Dgrnsiais. they would be tough names to live with, imagine all the teachers with mis-spellings and mis-pronounciations. They do sounds a bit made up...i like Farah, Ayesha or Alia if your going for those types of names.

XOtHsTo0aa	I would call and talk to the nurse and tell her about what is going on with your son.  Maybe she can give you some insight on whether it's just a phase or if he might be sick and if he should come in sooner.|`|JjbragXNaa	Your son will eat as much as he needs.  If he's acts ok and seems healthy, he's fine.  The doctor will check to see if he's growing at a normal rate and you can ask him then about his eating habits.  Don't worry. :)  Also, if I remember right 3 months in when you can start feeding him baby food besides formula.  Ask your doc about that, too.|`|fkuKHXqJaa	My son went through a similar thing when he turned 3 months Im pretty sure it was a growth spurt because he is fine now.|`|RiLmN8Q2aa	I went through the same thing.. There were times when my son wouldnt eat much, but a few days later, he would eat like a pig! - But that was his growth spurts.. - Babies eat a lot when they have growth spurts|`|UAXHmqgRaa	I have three daughters ages 4,3, and 11months, and all of them at one point or another went through something like this. Check his gums, maybe he is begining to cut teeth, that sometimes makes a child loose their appatite. Or  maybe he is just going through a stage. My girls did the same thing for both reasons. I would still keep your dr. appt just to be sure, but i think it would be ok to wait until next week. As long as he is getting some formula, he wont dehidrate. I would wait as long as he isn't totally boycotting his feedings. Good luck and don't worry its probably just a phase.|`|SbBhTDtLaa	I am the mother of twins, I also experienced the same with one of my twin, he learned sleep through the night in his 3rd month, but the other was waking up through the night.  But they are growing normally, I feel it is normal.  Talk to your doctor.|`|YW72TLapaa	I dont think a 3 month old should go 9hrs without feeding.  my son is almost 3months and he sleeps only one or two hrs at a time during the day the most he goes without eating is 4 hrs at night.  Take him tothe doctor. have you tried feeding him even while he is sleeping?  i dont think its normal. babies tend to be hungry all the time. But your doctor knows more... he should be able to tell you if its normal.
wLe7nBLGaa	if you did get pregnant...i don't think you would have symptoms this early...the egg hasn't even implanted so no hormones are being released into your body just yet. you could be coming down with a cold or something. but its always possible you can be pregnant. if you are late for your next period you should just take a hpt.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	it is highly unlikely that u got pregnant this weekend and are experiencing these symptoms . they usually dont accrue until 4 + weeks preganant|`|JjBwydymaa	Well hun... Ive been sick and have had terrible nausea for the past 2 day.. The only thing is I would have only conceived 6 days ago ...but Im having strong period pains and im not due my peirod 4 atleast a week..so it could be related to pregnancy. (i dont dare get my hopes up tho)    So what Im saying is...symtoms vary for different people. Peope can have them as early as conception while other wont start getting them to around 5 weeks. its so different for every pregnancy. So yes there could be a possibilty.    Do a test hun x|`|oX4mg0ghaa	I got pregnant with my first a few days after my period and felt the way that you say you do. I had the same discription of discharge as well. I took a test about 8 days b4 I was expected to have my period and it was already positive, so maby you can take a test and just see what it says. Sounds like it to me!!! I hope you get the answer YOU want!    I didn't even think about pregnancy, I just took a test to make sure b4 I started bc pills and that was what was causing my strange symptoms, you DO NOT have to be 4 or more weks along to feel symptoms, most people probably don't until then, but I had those symptoms at about 2 weeks!|`|AA11185897	Early symptoms and everyone says YOU'RE CRAZY.     I heard it all. But you have to remember that sperm swims around in there for many days waiting.    I started to have symptoms within 36 hours of conceiving. Peeing was the first. Then Dizzy. With some really tired with others full of energy. By the second week I was sick with every smell.    Even before implantation, your body knows something is going on in there. Some woman are sensitive to it and others just aren't, those are the ones that think we are nuts. lol
mxrlZEweaa	If he gave him amoxicillin he has an infection of some kind, probably ear infection. You can call the doctor's office and have a nurse look at his file and see what it says. Your baby could get well just as fast as he go sick, so make sure he takes all of the amoxcillian, on time everyday.    Hope he feels better!|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	Because he has a viral infection, which will not respond to an antibiotic! That would be my guess.
e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	Both of you are too immature to have children if you are asking this question (and 18 is too young anyway!).  A surrogate mother is someone who has an embryo (that was made in the lab, not in a person) implanted into her.  An embryo already in another person cannot be put into someone else (at least not with today's technology).|`|AA11210211	First it is very doubtful that she would know she is pregnant at 2 weeks,not impossible but VERY doubtful,and No if you are already impregnated you cannot carry her baby for her,that is impossible.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Its not possible to know at 2 weeks,  and no you cannot.|`|jcXSNjowaa	impossible to be 2 weeks .. shes just just just just just have gotten pregnant .. or wouldnt even be pregnant yet.    2 weeks- ovulation    and no you couldnt.|`|0zWJlNi1aa	i dont understand??|`|CuCrGDuRaa	She can't be 2 weeks pregnant.  If she missed her period 2 weeks ago she is 6 weeks pregnant.  But no, that is not possible.  You can't be a surrogate when you are already pregnant and you can't take a baby from a pregnant woman and put it in you.  That's not how it works.
Fc7j3T3naa	I'm 26 weeks and still wake up on my back sometimes. It's because I'm uncomfortable. The pressure from the baby and your uterus is resting on your spine and your blood flow. You don't need to worry about hurting your baby! He probably just kicks sometimes because he has a little more wiggle room. My baby does the same thing!    Good luck! Hope this helps!!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I know its hard not to sleep that way sometimes. My problem is I will make sure that I dont lay on my back but when I wake up in the middle of the night to use the restroom I will be sleeping on my back. Just try not to do it but sometimes it just happens. As long as you continue to feel baby moving and you know when to switch positions I think you are fine.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's not the baby you have to worry about when on your back, it's your blood flow. The baby will be laying on the main vessel that brings the blood to your heart and your intestines so you may get backaches, hemorrhoids, less efficient digestion, interfere w/optimum circulation and possibly cause hypotension or low blood pressure which can make you dizzy. It will not cause any harm to your baby though.
xXnFx6qLaa	So........ It's the woman's fault if the dad just takes off and leaves her with the baby??    What about if the father had died?  Is that the woman's fault as well?    I get what you are saying - people need to take responsibility for their actions, but don't just group everyone together.    I'm a single mom.  I found out when I was 8 months pregnant that my son's father was doing some things behind my back that I don't agree with.  Should I have just dealt with it?  No.  I don't want my son raised around that BS.  And - I've known him for over 10 years.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Well to start, there are two sides to every story. Keep that in mind too!    Ive said my story 1000 times but Ill say it again. My husbands ex gf did things quite dirty with him. She claims she knew he was the father ALL along, yet she does things that prove she either had no freakin clue who the father to her child was or that shes just a dirty person who had no intention on allowing her childs TRUE father actually step up and BE a father.     We found out about this little girl when she was 2 yrs old. We got a phone call when we were dating from his ex stating she just had his kid and wanted money. Hmm.and this is the first weve heard of it? So of course, he wanted a DNA test and she got defensive. She ended up moving to our area and my husband took a DNA test which turned out to be his child. So he missed out on 2 yrs of her life, because her mother chose another man to play Daddy as well as sign the birth certificate. And when they broke up, she decided to let her daughters REAL father know that he had a child on this earth.     For a person who KNEW he was the father all along, she sure as heck played a dirty game!    We took her to court, things STILL arent on our side. And my husband has done no wrong. Hes actually gone above and beyond to try and make things right. If my husband didnt push this issue, hed never know he had a daughter. And again, this was all because her Mom wanted to play games.     But the biggest question: Did her mother ONCE consider how important it was for her child to know her father????|`|TQW5E6olaa	No I don't agree that the best thing you can give a child is a father. The best thing you can give a child is a good upbringing and a loving supportive family. Should women who are raped, find and marry their rapists? Should women who are beaten, stay with their abusers? Should any woman stay in a situation that's turned ugly? No.    Irresponsible young females. So no matter what, if he isn't' in the picture it's our fault? Nope, I disagree. Something you can't control is another person' s will. People change and sometimes they don't change for the better.    Everything was going great for me until my fiancee nearly died in a motorcycle accident, then he was a completely different person, I left an found out I was pregnant shortly after. I suppose it's my fault that I wanted a better life for my child and myself, we didn't go back. We were together 7 years.    Bad situation?! No my dear, we have a wonderful life, whether we live with daddy or not. And he is involved.     You can't generalize and apparently you don't have a good handle on what's common in society so save yourself the trouble of trying to understand it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think the best thing you can give your baby is a loving stable family.  So sometimes that means a father, but in some cases, the father is the problem.  I mean I'm happy my son has his father and me, married and living together but if my husband was a crazy abusive jerk I think my son would be better off if I went to live with my parents.|`|faPKwClPaa	I do agree with you, for the most part, but this stuff drives me crazy:    "...saving yourself and waiting to have unprotected sex with your husband and planning a baby."    It is irresponsible to tout this because it is unrealistic and just ain't gonna happen.    The best thing society can do to curb this problem is open and available sex eduction, free birth control, and support for young adults to help their realize their potential outside of sex.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	A good father is preferable to 'a father'.  In a perfect world everybody would have a good father.  No father is preferable to an abusive father.    "Its better to be from a broken home, than in one"    Dr. Phil euphamism|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I see where you're coming from and hopefully one day (not really a priority for me right now) I'll find a good man who will love me and my baby.    I don't necessarily agree that it is the best thing you could give your child and I think it's a nice 'fantasy' to believe that getting married and planning a baby can all be a perfect little fairy tale.... I don't see so much of this in the real world.     I think it is important for your child to see you love someone and for you to allow someone to love you, but sometimes it doesn't always work on a set time line.|`|yjDAg8v7aa	I strongly disagree. I believe the best thing you can give your child is a stable, loving family. A family doesn't have to be mommy and daddy. A family can be mommy and daddy, daddy and daddy, mommy and mommy, just mommy, just daddy, grandparents, siblings, or any combination! I think lots of adults-males and females-should think before they act, but there are lots of females who are in loving relationships and things change. I've got female friends who's sig. others decided to bail out, but I also know men who's sig. others bailed out after child birth. I think children should have a female role model and a male role model, but I don't think that has to be a father and mother...grandfathers, uncles, friends....lots of other people can be perfect role models if daddy (or mommy) decideds not to take part. And...I don't think you have to be married to have a loving committed relationship and stable home for a child.|`|AA11481889	It takes two to tango...and while...yes it is usually the woman that gets left caring for a baby alone...You're making the assumption that all single mothers are the product of some irresponsible behavior.  That's pretty closed minded and quite frankly...ignorant.    I agree that people have gotten too liberal with themselves and their priorities and yes people should absolutely make wiser decisions when considering bringing a human life into a relationship....but no relationship is perfect or 100% safe against deterioration.    So ...no in my opinion  "A Father" is not the best gift you can give a child.  I think having intelligent parents is the most important thing...and in some cases, obviously...sometimes kids are lucky to even have the one.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Maybe more men should step up and remove their heads from their asses. MEN need to take responsibility, the women already do by raising the kids that the men won't help with. It's not cut and dried, some married men bail when their wives get pregnant. Some married men cheat. Some fathers are abusive to their kids mother.     A ring on the finger doesn't make a guy a better dad. A daddy is based on love and affection and guidence. My mom and dad are married and my dad used to beat the crap out of me and my older siblings. He'd get drunk 24/7 and spend his money on beer and cigarettes. So, because he stayed around and was married to my mom, he's a good dad?    Parenting is based on love, support, and guidence. If the dad in the picture can't give those things, no dad at all would benifit the kid in the long run.|`|dDVAUA9saa	sorry, I didn't read your entire long-winded post, but I disagree.    To me, the best thing you can give a baby is unconditional love and affection.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	what about the fathers that secretly abuse children and the children try to tell someone but noe one believes them. wouldn't a single parent's with love be so much better. my mother died when i was little- did i suffer from that?a little but i grew from it and i learned. and my father did the best he could. YOU ARE being judgmental because you have no idea what their situations are.many women are in relationships for years with the same man, find out they are pregnant and boom they find themselves alone with a baby     BTW a woman doesn't give her childa  father, she gives her child a mother. a MAN give his child a father, whether he wants to is another question|`|KHZLPldraa	oh boy!  I agree with you on the over all opinion you have and if we were in a perfect world then yes great.  However the dim reality of today's society this is just not the case.  Also birth control is not always 100% effective either.  I am still with the father of my children however, my cousin has two beautiful children with a man that behind her back was making and selling illegal drugs and cheating, I supported her decision to keep her kids away from him, and they are now 9 and 6 and very well adjusted children.  I don't think you can categorize it as all women's responsibility because there are men (not all obviously) that are very sneaking and deceiving.  (just as many women as well).|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Nope. The best thing you can give a baby is love. I completely disagree with just about everything you say. Based on some of your comments, I'm not sure you're living in the real world.     Harriet|`|P2hhUsoMaa	I agree with you completely.  I know a girl who had a baby and doesn't want the father to have anything to do with the baby.  She moved out of their apartment one day and a month later took him to court for child support.  He pays and hasn't talked to her or the daughter since.  She won't allow him to see his daughter now.  The mother was raised without a father around and I truely think she wants to raise her daughter that way so she can say "I did it".  She changed the daughters last name back to hers also so It will make it harder for the child to go look for her father if/when she wants to.  I don't care what happens, I would never keep my children from their father.  They need me and him equally.  As much as the court systems are always in favor of the women, I think it's wrong that the men are walked all over and not given a chance.|`|5dca67bd0dd4aa9a8ea84176747ecb36aa	Question like this just kill me.  Best thing people can give their child is a father?  What about a mother?  You ASSume that men are absent but forget to mention when the mom abandons, dies, etc.  My mother handed me (age 1) and my sister (age 3) to children's services and walked away.  I have never had a mom.   Let's talk about the need for a loving woman, too.|`|MT2FnWK5aa	i think you should print this out put on a bright pink fl yer and put it around all the high schools for all those little girls who think they are grown     p.s   post at the clubs as well i am so tired of hearing those girls/woman who are always back mouthing there baby daddy's ain't worth shitt

I think it's actually really cute!|`|gebIjqnWaa	I wouldn't because it would attract religious prejudice to bear against her.|`|qxnxm0YLaa	I think it's pretty for a girl. FYI: Hip Hop artist Lauren Hill named ner child (not sure about the gender) Zion.
bCmqScVlaa	It's very important that you talk to your doctor, preferably a hepatologist that specializes in liver disease, that could tell you if it would be safe.      Go to a website at www.liverdisease.com  It has a whole section on cirrhosis and pregnancy.  Just scroll down and you will run into it.    This is Dr. Melissa Palmer's website.  She is an excellent hepatologist that is world known for her work specializing in liver disease.  I know this will help you.|`|846dea7801aa96951a367fa9bd77cfbbaa	I have never heard of this, sorry. But I do have a friend that has cysts in her liver and the doctor told her she should have more kids because of her  liver, she had one more and then got her tubes tied. I think you should ask your dr, good luck
44PnMUCLaa	Sounds like you answered your own question.  If having a baby is more important than losing the weight...there is your answer.  You can still eat a healthy diet and exercise to lose some pounds while TTC.  You never know how long it's going to take to actually get pregnant, so it's better to start eating healthy now, because you'll want to eat as clean as you can while you're carrying that baby.  Good luck!|`|vVwbz5Qraa	don't do any hard diets that really aren't that healthy. what i recommend is watch your serving sizes and cut back on bread, cheese, pasta and potatoes. starches aren't good. eat fruit and veg. exercise and stay active. they say you burn 100 calories during sex so eat right have sex and do a little running. of course run before sex. if you have sex then run wait at least a couple hours because gravity will kick in and make the sperm come out|`|9GuqdXa2aa	I would hold off on dieting, considering you are not out of the normal weight range for your height. You can start drinking 100oz of water, reducing animal protein and increasing soy and bean protein. Remember lots of fruits and veggies and a prenatal vitamin for health. You will increase your fitness and might shed a few pounds while keeping yourself baby ready.
gli7SbBoaa	Accidents happen.  I'd clean them up and remind them that if they feel they have to go that they should go onto the potty even if they don't have to go.      I had my own accident as a teen.  I had the 'runs' really bad and one of my brothers was in the bathroom and I couldn't hold it.  Even teens and adults can't make it sometimes so you should never punish a child for an accident.|`|irLnPW4aaa	I would help him get cleaned up and changed into clean clothes, then remind him to stop what he is doing and go use the bathroom when necessary.|`|p07RwZK2aa	Well it depends which of my children did it!     If it was one of my six year old daughters I would be concerned and think she might be ill.     If it was my three year old son then I wouldn't be so worried, but ask why he did it and just change him.|`|dnEmFs2maa	If it's infrequent, they probably didn't mean to.  It's possible they either were too busy playing or just couldn't make it to the potty in time.  This will happen from time to time in young children.  If it becomes frequent, then there's a problem that would need to be looked into.  Emotional frustration, laziness, and stomach illness could be possible reasons for this.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Change her pants.|`|flqAr30laa	take her home and change her, maybe she's sick in the tummy.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Sympathize, assure her that accidents happen, and clean her up.|`|E15fLONGaa	Clean them up.|`|rNsCkHEwaa	Kids can and do have accidents.  Don't make him feel bad about it, just help him get changed and cleaned up.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Ask if they were not feeling well.  My son had a few accidents when he had the stomach flu.  He thought he only had to toot and well accidents happen.  If they were fine I would ask why and try to find out why.  Could be a attention grabbing ploy.|`|cteyFJxhaa	I would probably ask why and point out only babies do that.|`|8HgvkFowaa	How old is 'potty trained' to you? I work in a daycare, primarily with the ones in potty-training, and there are so many of them that poop their pants knowing very well they need to go to the potty. You shouldn't freak out. Just sternly remind them they need to use the toilet.   Now, if it's an accident, that's understandable too. My brother was already nine when he pooped his pants on a fieldtrip (we think he got food poisoning). I actually got a call telling me I needed to come to the IMAX and get him b/c he had had an "accident".  Not only that, my sister was already a senior in high school when she got food poisoning on a tournament and did the same thing!|`|cJ1hizgHaa	Be a parent and clean them up, its common sense really, maybe the poop sort of just came out, give the kid a break.
2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	no but make sure you check with your doctor with what your taking. those can have birth defects..|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	those  are not safe to take while pregnant b/c those are detrimental to the fetus.    It will not affect the test.    I am suppose to be taking a MS called trileptal. i dont b/c I'd rather be pregnant
Kr09aQJkaa	I was told that breastfeeding ties you down. What could be more portable than breasts? They are with me every where I go.    Someone told me to rub whiskey on the baby's gums to sooth teething pain. I found that whiskey on my gums works much better. lol    Raising your arms above your head during pregnancy will wrap the umbilical cord around the baby's neck.    You can't get pregnant while breastfeeding. Wrong!    Picking up a crying baby will spoil them. Sure, babys cry just to annoy you.     Diet coke is better than regular coke for a one year old. It will also calm an upset stomach. My grandma is nuts!    You should hear the crazy advice I got on how to have a happy marriage. Yikes!|`|qLkMSEBwaa	I didn't have anyone to help me with advice..the only family I have is 3 brothers.  My aunts/uncles are idiots, both parents died when we were young..LONG STORY usually don't have a problem going into it..but not today.  Anyway... My sorry ex-my son's sperm donor and his family done their best to make me have an abortion and when that didn't work, they done their best to physically cause me to miscarry.  He even threatened to kill himself if I didn't have an abortion..I said, BYE!!!!!!!!!!  My son was conceived AFTER my ex sold the home I paid for and left me homeless, raped me during the time I was with him-KING of all brain-washers, almost taking my sanity, then raped me 3 times after he left me homeless.  I NEVER once would have killed my baby over the sins of the father!!!!!!!  I have a medical condition that prevents me from conceiving and the Dr.'s still can not explain how I got pregnant..and I never used birth control...At the time, I was praying for death because of everything my ex put me through..but, I picked up myself and moved on.  I was in my 2nd semester in college, found myself a part-time job that paid full-time wages, and just got me an apartment.  My boss insisted I was pregnant and I told her there is no way it was my nerves..but, to shut her up because I knew my dreams of being a mommy were not in the cards for me-eventhough it was all I ever wanted in life, I accepted what I couldn't change.  The test showed positive the 2nd the drop of urine hit it..lol.  I knew it was wrong, went the next day to a well-clinic, and it done the same thing, did a checkup and was 2 months along..I had been sick from day 1..again, thought it was nerves.  my pregnancy was very high risk me and my baby could have died even the second after birth..plus, I knew my baby would have my ex's genetic bone disease. Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a simple bump can cause fractures-we lost count on how many he's had.  Even birth was going to be dangerous on both issues.  I was put on complete bed rest the last 3 months, then induced 3 weeks early because it became too dangerous to go any further.  I also did bloodwork 2 times a week and was on a very strict diet.  I only gained baby related weight.    I ran into a sister of an exfriend of mine, she tried to talk me out of breast feeding..I said, why on earth would I do that?  My milk was ready when he was.  I didn't have to boil and buy water or bottles, Many times, I rushed home from college to feed him and turned on the ac, and both of us often fell asleep during feedings.  He didn't get sick much..the health benefits was great.  It bonded us even more..I was not only grateful for the child I was told I couldn't have, but I would often be in tears for the fact, this is the sweet innocent baby, they wanted me to kill!!!!!!!  Also, the fact that I could do something for my son, no one else could do..he got his milk from me and as a mother, only one who breast feeds understands that bond.    Another was my aunt tried to stick his pacifier in mountain dew at 2 months.  I screamed at her and said, DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!  Her daughter who is nothing more than a baby making factory and living off the system..her kids as babies would come up to you and take your pop out of your hand!!!!!!!!!  I be damned if they would get my 2 month old hooked on mountain dew!!!!!!!!!!!!    I was told, not to let him use a pacifier, it would make his teeth bad..IDIOTS!!!!!!  That crap is genetic as far as buck teeth.  My son's teeth are straighter than anyone on my side or the other..lol and he loved his pacifier!!!!!    I done whatever I felt was in the best interest of my son..I had no problem telling people to go to hell with their suggestions!!!!!!!!!!    I even had one sick b!!tch who was pregnant..ask me if I got turned on when I was breast feeding him?  That it was natural...OMG!!!!!!!!!!!  I said, LISTEN HERE YOU SICK TWISTED B!!CH, THERE IS NOTHING MY SON COULD DO TO TURN ME ON AND IF A MOTHER GETS TURNED ON NURSING A BABY, SHE SHOULD BE SHOT AND KILLED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I wish they would make it a law that ALL stupid people can not breed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      EDIT.....  Well I see how many  pedophiles we have at least 5!!!!!!!!!|`|B2dQop3oaa	I'm not a mother, but still:    1. "Don't beat your children." Children are children, this also means they can't really figure out what you're yelling about until - lets say.. - the age of 10. Yes, they can understand you - but they'll forget sooner than you can say "Chironex Fleckeri" (which is actually the most toxic jellyfish on Earth!).    2. "Let them cry" - No! You're still the parent, they're still the kid. Crying can be good, but don't let them make a scene in the super market.    3. "Let them keep the pacifier" - Get rid of it as soon as possible. Perhaps keep it as a memory for later on?    Well, can't think of anything else so far. Good luck!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	My friend, an old frat brother of course haha told me to give my baby a shot of gin if its crying too much.  Then one of my other dumb friends suggested i start spanking when she's 10 months.  She's three and i havent spanked her once.  Lol all my friends arnt really dads so they dont get it.  This is a cool question though.|`|sUysQCxDaa	Ha ha... that is some bad advice.  I am 39 weeks pregnant, so I haven't gotten too much bad advice about the baby... but my bad pregnancy advice has been hillarious!    "Don't drink too much water 'cause you'll gain a lot of water weight and there will be too much water in your womb which could plug the baby's ears!' from my Dad.     "Don't eat strawberries 'cause the baby will have weird red birth marks" from my Grandmother    "If you want to breast feed you should toughen up your nipples by rubbing them with a toothbrush" from my Aunt. (terrible advice!!!! Luckily I read not to do it elsewhere)    People are weird. Already, before the baby is born, I have got some advice that is a little odd (like sell your dog as he is likely to attack the baby-- even though he is well trained, and will not be allowed in the baby's room, or around her  unsupervised) Oh well. I just ignore it for the most part!    lol|`|SRuMAjSpaa	My mother-in-law told me I shouldn't hug my kids after giving them(physical) discipline, and that the 'silent treatment' was good cause it let's them know that you're mad.    All I can say to that is: What the ' EFF ' EVER!!|`|o3BCBXLBaa	Like some other people on here, I was told not to put my arms over my head cause it would wrap the cord. My son's cord was wrapped but, I swear its cause he moved show much in the womb. lol!    I was also told that my son would always be sick if I didn't breast feed. He wasn't sick as infant!|`|I6w6Nrphaa	my mother-in-law told me that I could not breastfeed because I DIDN'T DRINK MILK.   OMG!!!      My mother-in-law told me to give my newborn vanilla pudding so she could sleep through the night.|`|vSLHaTFHaa	The worst advice I got was spanking your kids is a good thing.|`|mpc6aNvCaa	this happened to my niece when her daughter was visiting her dad's family instead of plain water they gave her vinegar and water, that is gross and nasty. but also my mom, mom's told her breastfeeding is nasty and not healthy, sugar on a binky will get rid of hiccups just said okay  never did. but  good luck and more odd things we find out as we live life.|`|gUxpwEXbaa	It seems everyone has something to say right.    When I was pregnant of my first baby my dad gave me a green light bulb and told me to put it near the crib, the green light would stimulate the babys intelligence. Its not a bad advice, but a weird one.     A friend of mine advised me to get on my hand and keens before I went to sleep. She said that this helped the baby to sleep better, and so he would kick and turn at night because he would be sound asleep. Lol Ive never heard anything funnier.     This one was an advice from my husbands friend when he told him I was pregnant for the second time. He gave him the number of an abortion clinic, and told him it was better this way. That was completely ridiculous, why would anyone advice you to have an abortion, especially if you are haply married.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I don't think your SIL's advice was necessarily bad to be honest.  Formula is a wonderful alternative to breast feeding if you can't breast feed or simply don't wish to.  But I suppose the way she said it could have been a tad offensive.  I've done both.  I mainly formula fed my son and my daughter is currently breast fed.    Anyhow, the worst advice I received was "sleep when the baby sleeps".  Sure that can apply if you only have one baby, but when my second baby was born... yeah that's a different story!    The second worst was "let them cry it out" and my baby was only 6 weeks old.  I don't think so!    Others include "if you don't co-sleep, you won't bond with your baby" (ridiculous!  I bond with them wonderfully) and "letting them run around in a diaper only is neglectful".  Well in the dead heat of summer and it's warm out, I don't see anything wrong with it!  I do keep them in the shade and use sunscreen.|`|723QHuicaa	Dont co sleep.. why? You will suffocate her?!?!    Put honey on her paci.. WTF???    Let her cry it out, show her who is boss... Eh. its a family, not a management system|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I got told to put sugar lumps in her milk to stop her having a sweet tooth when she was older..  Like you I smiled and nodded|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	that i will be fat after baby I have always been thin and work on it My friend didnt try so they blamed it on babies rather than fast food and no moving they would tell me in all rudeness oh yo uare thin cause you didnt have a bay like me blahhh blahh   so after i had my girl i was 10 pounds lighter right away boy they shut up lol|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Hmm..probably that after my son was born c-section, that I should have all c-sections from then on. My FIL the former doctor who thinks he knows everything 'advised' me this was what I should do. I ended up having a great VBAC 2 years later. :)    Or the inference that two kids was enough for me ... I always laugh when I remember how my MIL nearly choked to death when I told her I wanted three kids.     Can't think of anything else, probably because I ignored anything that didn't sound right to me. LOL :)    ETA: Lisa Marie, I am laughing my a$$ off - "What could be more portable than breasts?" Y!A Quote of the Year, for sure LOL!|`|KWHiJbhaaa	Well the latest bad advice was from my MIL who told us she fed jim baby food at two months old we should do the same with our son so is belly will be filled up quicker. Lets see plenty of people tell me I'm spoiling my son and that sometimes he needs to just cry himself down(WTF??). Oh I've heard only feed him about 1.75 oz per feed or you will explode his belly(true story and a nurse told me this), Get him circumcised(tired of that whole debate). Lol I'm sure there are more but I just can't think of them at the moment.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	hahah my sister told me not to put my arms over my head while pregnant cause the cord would wrap around the babys neck.. hahah. whatever..|`|cteyFJxhaa	Some people tried to tell me that babies should only drink whole milk.  When I asked the doc he said that stupid....most babies don't need extra fat in their diet any more than adults.|`|mxrlZEweaa	My MIL used to tell me when I was pregnant not to eat watermelon, because when she was pregnant that's all she ate and her daughter came out with a huge watermelon seed birthmark on her face.|`|yl0CZsy2aa	i dont think i got any bad advice, but i thought my mother didnt hold my daughter up enough when she drank her bottle.  I always told her to sit her up more.

mxrlZEweaa	Maybe she just isn't completely ready yet. You just have to keep on it, but if she feels pressured she is going to keep having "accidents". Good luck and I wish you success! My 3 1/2 year old boy won't even go near a toilet.|`|DKqsFGymaa	Two things I noticed in your question...you're expecting baby  3 and your daughter is very, very smart and advanced.  That's a toxic combination.      You would think that the advanced children would be the easiest to train because they'd understand the concept quickly.  The opposite is true.  Advanced children are the hardest to potty train because they know they don't want anyone else telling them what they should do.    On top of that, whether she says it out loud or not, she's dealing with another baby coming into the house taking away even more of the attention than the second one did.    Sit down with your daughter one on one.  Explain to her that with the baby coming you need a big girl in the house to help you.  The two of you can come up with a list of things that she will be able to do to take care of the new baby.  Maybe she could find a stuffed animal she does not want anymore that the new baby could have.  And she could give her diapers to the new baby.  Let her know that you'll still have time for one on one time with her and you love her very much.  She'll always be special to you because she came first.    Good luck with your daughter and best wishes for the third baby.  Parents say the third kid keeps you busier than ever!|`|djFYf3qUaa	My sister was the same way. Some weeks were better than others. But my mom would tell her to sit on the potty until she could go, then she gave her a treat, such as a piece of small candy. And congratulate her for her achievement. Also, it helps when dad got home from work, and my mom would say, ''Daddy guess what Ava did!?'' and my mom would tell him and they would get all excited like...and say that they were very proud of her, and that was a big encouragement for her also.  And make sure to tell her, to tell you, when she needs to go again so you can sit her on the potty again.   Hope this helps!|`|38d87179576c32ac76f38cabc9694ef6aa	My daughter was about 2 and a half when I found out I was expecting baby number 2. So I did everything I could think of to get her to use the potty... Nothing worked. So one day I started crying because I knew I would be changing diapers for the rest of my life and I  gave up on the potty issue. The very next day, she woke up, threw her diapers in the babys room and said, ok, I a big girl now. She had one accident that night and that was it.. So, the point is, don't be discouraged and don't push. You have introduced her to the potty and thats all you really can do. She has to take it from there... I know how you feel and I know you can do it.|`|N072Uv3Taa	I had a similar problem with my son when he was 3 (he's about to be 5 now)...    The method that worked for me was setting an egg timer for 25 minute intervals to take him for quick trips to the potty. I did this over a weekend. Though my son was going to the potty, he wasn't actually "going". He was more interested in the fact that he was gaining independence in another room of the house. By Tuesday of the following week, he began going by himself, actually using the potty, and moving on. He learned it was better than the alternative of mommy taking him in the bathroom every 20-30 minutes. He would still have accidents every now and again, but that is a normal process of learning to use the potty.
shKc7lZcaa	*****************Lots of dust to you**********************  Hoping AF is a no show for you!!!!!!!!|`|3MDY29gnaa	i hope it doesn't come for at least another 9 months your you :0)  good luck|`|2nfMSDiPaa	Hey hun nausea and vomiting are common signs of early pregnancy- for some people nausea can be quite crippling in the first few months - and even thereafter.    As for the heart burn when you are pregnant, the uterus starts swelling and puts pressure on the other organs in the stomach. This swelling can cause the process of digestion to greatly slow down. To combat this slow down, your body will increase its release of stomach acid to help the digestive process. As a result of the slow emptying of the stomach, you may experience mild to severe heartburn during the early stages of pregnancy. In such a situation, it may help you to eat some soda crackers and drink sparkling water. This should provide relief to some extent.    In addition to drinking a lot of water on a regular basis, it is recommended to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Foods such as raisin and bran cereal can greatly reduce the amount of heartburn outbreaks. Smaller meals are easier to digest and therefore less likely to trigger heartburn. A vitamin supplement will also aid in digestion. By following a healthy diet, you can help to prevent heartburn during the early stages of pregnancy.     Hope this helps your symptoms sounds like you are pregnant!!    Good -luck I hope you get BFP!!  Millions of baby dust to you!!    Take care|`|WdUdUkYFaa	Baby dust to you!!! Good luck!|`|J42Q48cAaa	Tons of baby dust your way!!!
7uVlYPEIaa	My mom was always happy with the house being clean and in order and a night off from making dinner. Now it makes her happy for us all to just be together. The youngest three still live at home, but one is an adult and works, the other is a college student and works, the other is 11. Us older two live over an hour away in opposite directions.    Get her her favorite candy and a card and write her a note about how much she means to you.    For Christmas we got my mom a family portrait (she hasn't had one taken in 20 years when there was only 3 kids and no grand kids) and a digital picture frame so we can email her pictures of the girls and she can proudly display them.    My favorite presents so far as a mom was a plastic flamingo my son found that fit perfectly on a chain (i love flamingos, he saw it and begged my mom to buy it for me) and on mother's day the year my son was born he gave me his first kiss (he was 3 month's old and when I asked he leaned over with his mouth open)|`|zi9knUCGaa	Those gifts sound wonderful! I would love to get gifts like that. Parents don't expect all kinds of gifts from their children. Just the thought that you cared enough to even want to give her gifts is enough. When my birthday comes around, I'm happy with just a card (especially a home-made one)  Your mom is lucky to have such a great kid!|`|hstwNjNaaa	Yeah, that's lots of really nice gifts! I'm sure she'll love whatever you get her, but those presents sound really thoughtful.|`|TGtgMu8eaa	Aw yeh thats fine|`|da9b10820ab3418773c06c2801187326aa	That's quite a lot for a 46th birthday. It really depends on the relationship you have with your mum. But naturally she will expect something small if anything and will not want you spending lots if you are strapped for cash!|`|BBhVUNKOaa	YES.. IT IS.. look a mother wants their children just to behave good.. what ever you give her.. she will know that you did it with all your heart.|`|wLe7nBLGaa	those are great gifts for your mom...but honestly what moms really want is their childrens happiness. just for them to say how much they love you. thats all i wanted from my kids...oh yeah and for them to clean their room. mydaughters who are 5 and 8 made me cards...it was from their little hearts and i melted to peices. my oldest daughter put in 20 dollars in her card and i gave it back to her and i told her that all the money in the world couldn't give me what i want because i already had my girls...ok ok i know i'm getting a little cheesy...blame it on the pregnancy horomones. but those are wonderful gifts for your mom!!!|`|onMxrIzHaa	yes u have plenty u prolly still live with her and ur like in ur teens right? well anyway she prolly doesn wnt u to give her anything so i say yes u have so much for her that i bet she'll cry|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Awwe that sounds wonderful!  She will love it..   And your cooking diner?    You have a lucky mom!  :)|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Arw thats nice of you :)   Its not all bout how much you spend on her though she'l be gratful for what ever.    This christmas i spent about 40 ($50ish) on my mum and got a photoframe that could hold about 5/6 pics and got a load of old photo's of us.. She loved it.  I think it was a good idea... should try it.    :)|`|wzXJOSIeaa	That seems likes more than enough. I'm sure all your mom really wants for her birthday is to spend time with her daughter. Your mom is very lucky to have a daughter like you.
3yXpjXdkaa	I don't think you're asking too much.  I think the issue is that you both have to be ready.  In my experience, when one of us wasn't quite sold on the idea, it wasn't the right time.  When we were both in sync about the idea, it seemed to happen and the timing was perfect.  In the long run, another year or so will not matter as much as it may seem right now.      Enjoy your 1 year-old and your husband will come around.  Just keep your communication going and listen to each other.|`|buoqtZeFaa	All you can really do is talk to him at this point.  Find out why he is not ready and also tell him why you are ready at this time.  See if the two of you can come to some agreement on when to start trying again.    Good luck and I hope it happens for you soon!|`|IMHwA20jaa	You're not asking too much, you're just stating what you would like and if your husband loved his family, he should allow it. He may just be stressed, and there's always adoption. :) Hope it helps!|`|Ia0ZivJMaa	no,keep on asking questions|`|PR0kF1yDaa	Dont force it, it is an issue for the both of you do consider.  I for one like having them closer together, it made it easier to shop for toys and they get along well and I was in 'baby mode'. I was all ok with giving up that part of my life to not leaving the room w/o a baby, babyproofing, feeding every 2 hours, diapers etc. Now my youngest of 3 boys is 4 and I am out of baby mode. I enjoy being able to go to the store whenever, to movies, to take the kids to 'big kids' places, etc. Some however do not like it, and it is hard going places such as to the store with more than one toddler. If he isnt ready now though it will just cause stress between you two and make him feel he is opinion isnt worth much to you. I suggest you lay your case out and say ok, let me know the minute your ready! Good luck.
2YOewnZBaa	Right now im currently nursing and bottle feeding. Ive used SO many bottles and my daughter just kept refusing bottles.    My mom told be about the playtex drop in bottles, she used them when she had babies. I can successfully say my daughter bottle feeds and nurses, no problem.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	I combo fed too and used Avent bottles - my son loved them.  We also sometimes use Platex drop-ins, because they are easier for him to hold himself.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	The playtex drop in bottles proved to be the best for me. The nipple is wide at the base resembling a nipple more than other bottles. Not to mention they are BPA free and don't take much cleaning. You just throw away the liner you used and pop another one in next time you fed. Best of luck!|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Tommee Tippee do some Closer to Nature bottles, which are meant to be as close to a real nipple as possible. They are designed for mums who are breastfeeding, but need to use a bottle as well. The shape of the bottle is made so you can feed the baby close to your chest.    We've found them great, better than any others we've had.    Good luck with your new baby!|`|siDcjgJCaa	We found we had to try several different bottles and nipple before we found the right one for Sophie. I did see at on of the stores they make a nipple that is shaped very similiar to a breast. It is advertised for babies who switch between breast and bottle.  But we use the Playtex air flow system with the wide slow flow nipple. but your baby may not like that one. It is trial and error really.. the best advice I got was to find something that was shaped like your breasts are or get as close as possible.|`|uN1zCMmjaa	advent :)|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	I"ve heard the adiri bottles. they are SUPER EXSPENSIVE!    They are shapped to look like a book/nipple and they feel like that too, they aren't the solidly hard plastic. it's rather soft. Its suppose to similate a real human nipple so as to NOT cause nipple confusion.     I bought an adiri bottle for my daughter when she was 6 months old, but she wouldn't take it. She didn't like bottles at all.  They do not have any suction to them. Like the baby doesn't need to suck to get the milk out, it will just flow out of the nipple, and the you pour things into the bottom of them, very weird bottle, and they do leak, but suppose to be the best for this kind of stuff.    what about just increasing your milk supply and eating extra nutrients for your baby. At this young of an age you may end up bottle feeding if you do nursing like that.    Good luck|`|l79QIWszaa	I would suggest talking with your doctor and nurses about "gavage feeding".  If your preemie has received milk orally in the NICU, this may be how they have done it.  It is when you put a small tube on your pinkie and feed the baby milk through that.  It really decreases nipple confusion for breastfeeding.  The hospital may be able to provide you with the supplies you need.    Whatever you do decide on, make sure that it is BPA free!      I salute you for planning to breastfeed your preemie; you are doing the best thing!  Congratulations.
yCwPxulYaa	My baby was 5 lbs 14 oz when we left the hospital, and I carried her out in my ring sling and she fit perfectly.  I think that she should be fine.  She should be nice and cozy!|`|DNygQdmVaa	she should be fine I had my preemie in a sling at 7 pounds and he was fine.|`|Q2g7oLGGaa	I would say yes, as long as you keep her body aligned and her airway open.  I have a Hotsling and they have a CD that shows how to put a small baby in it.  You have to put a blanket under their bottom and back and make sure their head is tilted back a little so they don't close off their airway.  I put my 7-8 pound baby in mine and she's loved it ever since.

hWc65sEtaa	Chances are your not, but there's always a chance.  If your late then take a test.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	99.9% sure you would not be pregnant.|`|H74F8jxuaa	Most of the cases, you aren't pregnant.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but some women have "periods" while they are pregnant, so there is a possibility, but it isn't very likely.|`|VzOokYEqaa	you can get pregnant at any time. you need to know your cycle and how your body work to be sure, everyone is different.     apparently i got pregnant on my period or a couple days before.|`|mCDopsLEaa	yes. the egg can only survive 24 hours after ovulation date and ovulation usually occurs between 7-14 days after the start of your last period.|`|gebIjqnWaa	At that time in your cycle, it is doubtful that an egg was viable for fertilization. The chances for conception is very minimal. Odds are, you're fine.|`|AA12180549	I am probably going to tell you stuff you already know but here goes.... First of all, it is highly unlikely you are pregnant because of the ovulation times.  However, if you are taking fertility drugs it is not out of the question.     Generally speaking "the most fertile period (the time with the highest likelihood of sexual intercourse leading to pregnancy) covers the time from some 5 days before ovulation until 1-2 days after ovulation. In an average 28 day cycle with a 14-day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week of the cycle. Fertility awareness methods of birth control attempt to determine the precise time of ovulation in order to find the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle.    People who have heard about the menstrual cycle and ovulation may commonly and mistakenly assume, for contraceptive purposes, that menstrual cycles always take a regular 28 days, and that ovulation always occurs 14 days after beginning of the menses. This assumption may lead to unintended pregnancies. Note too that not every bleeding event counts as a menstruation, and this can mislead people in their calculation of the fertile window.    If a woman wants to conceive, the most fertile time occurs between 19 and 10 days prior to the expected menses."    Take a home pregnancy test, follow the instructions by the letter. Use your initial morning urine, etc. But as we all know, there is nothing more sure than a visit to the Doctor to relieve your stress.|`|cJep8NnHaa	thats not always true. you have to wait a sum of two weeks and then take the test. but your probably not.!!
SHCFMLFbaa	The cramps you were feeling were completely normal. That is your uterus getting ready for the delivery. It contracts and expands so when that day comes, it won't have to do as much work. For example, if you were training to run a marathon, I highly doubt that you wouldn't train and stretch months prior to the race. This is what your body is doing.    As for the pains down below, this is also something I encountered. I am 36w5d and I still get those pains. Depending on the position of your baby, he/she may be punching/kicking your pelvic bones, bladder, and other areas. It's not very comfortable, but worth it to know your baby will be strong and lively :0)    Good luck with everything!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	The cramps were probably Braxton hicks and the shooting pains are normal also that is your body stretching and your pelvic bones spreading preparing for you little one to come out.|`|nTuFIKUAaa	I had those unbearable, uncomfortable pains as well - everyday with my 1st sometimes. My Dr. told me it was me dialating, which is completely normal. It's also prob. baby moving into the birthing position, or dropping.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	see a doctor|`|mCDopsLEaa	your body is continuing to prepare for birth. your pelvis is seperating, your uterus is growing/stretching in size and your baby is beginning to be a little cramped. you probably felt braxton hicks and pains from your muscles stretching to accommadate baby.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Totally normal.  When you are in a position that your body feels is uncomfortable after a while you will start to have cramps.  The same thing happens when you are in labor, that's why it's a bad idea to be on your back the whole, aside from that whole fighting gravity thing.  When your body is uncomfortable it is telling you to change positions, that's why you cramp.  The shooting pains in the vagina is totally normal too.  It's you body preparing for birth and preparing the baby for birth.  You're fine and baby is fine.  But this will become more frequent until labor.  In labor this will be even more constant, but if your hospital wont let you move around and wants to strap you to a table, I suggest you stay at home and labor until you are about 3 minutes apart in contractions.  If you have a midwife though you will no problem with moving around and finding comfortable positions to labor in.  Good luck|`|e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	I have that all the time now (31 weeks).  It started for me around 29 weeks and I asked my doctor.  She said it was pelvic pain.  Your pelvic ligaments are stretching so your pelvis will be open enough for the baby to fit through.  So, actually these pains are a good thing.  It means your body is preparing for birth like it is supposed to.  It's not fun, but it's necessary.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Braxton Hicks contractions. Get used to them, I have been having them since I was 26 weeks. It is just your baby preparing for the big day. Unless they become frequent or more than five in a hour, you don't have to worry.
oB4KxwuJaa	Please go to the OBGYN or at least call them.  It is probably nothing to worry about.|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	Yes it's very normal to have cramp while pregnant, you will feel a lot of cramp later on. It's normal as long you don't see any bleed there, if you do you need to go ER.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It sounds to me like your belly stretching.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	if its not ur first child its jus ur ligaments in ur belly stretching. i went to the hospital for the same thing and thats what they told me|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Always be on the safe side and go get checked out. I never experienced this depending on the pain I dont htink you should worry!|`|KdqaGnlwaa	I don't know if this is what you are talking about or not, but I read on babycenter.com, that around this time some women may experience pain in their belly button due to the uterus growing and shifting upwards.  It'll press up against your belly button causing it to hurt. I tried finding where I read that at, but I couldn't! Sorry! But if you still don't think thats it, talk to your doctor, or try googling it. It always works for me!      EDIT: I found this bulletin on babycenter.com. Hope it helps!    http://www.babycenter.com/400_what-is-th...
P1VoMS36aa	Hi, i have 4 children,it can take a while for your body to get back to its normal routine after pregnancy, after i had my first it took about 6 mnths to get the regular monthly cycle. after my other 3 i went on the pill contraceptive and that regulates the cycle for you.  if your not sexually active i would let your body settle naturally,tho i know its a pain not knowing when your next going to get a period!  i wouldn't worry about it tho,its all normal!   enjoy your baby!!!   xxxx|`|dpig5odPaa	I have a 4 month old and my period has been the exact opposite of yours. My doctor said weird periods are normal for 6 months after birth. But every doctor has a diff. opinion so you might give yours a call.|`|AA10651811	It depends on if you are breastfeeding.  If you are breastfeeding, you probably won't have a period for awhile.  Your cycle sounds pretty normal to me.  It took me about two month to have my first cycle and then I went on the pill so my cycle is pretty regular now.  Your body needs to have time to get back to it's original self so not having your period after a month a half seems quite normal.  If you want to be safe, you can always call your ob.  That's what they are there for.  Hope this helps and congratulations!!!
5JB1fHz9aa	I told my boss pretty much as soon as I found out because I have had miscarriages before and wanted to let her know just in case I had one so I could tell her what happened if I needed to miss work.  A lot of people wait till much later, but it is your choice.  I didn't really tell anyone else I was pregnant until I heard the heartbeat and knew everything was okay.  My job has some lifting too, but there is always someone else there that could do it so I was okay and didn't leave work until I was 36 weeks pregnant.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Talk to you Dr. first about the lifting. My Dr. told me to continue as normal and lift as I have been lifting unless I have any issues. Depending on your situation your Dr. may advise you differently.|`|AA11210211	Your best bet would be to tell them now,that way they can start looking for someone to fill the duties you can't perform while pregnant.|`|XCueIYnYaa	I would be telling them if i were you, you don't want to be reaching over your head when stocking, cuz it stretches, and moving heavy things can put huge amounts of strain on your back. Its all up to you when you stop working, i plan to work all the way up, but its everyone choice.|`|AA11510511	I would advise them now so both employers can be prepared for it.  You need to find out how much maternity leave both employers will give you, before you can decide when to stop working.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	this is something you should talk to your DR about. they will give you the best advice. but i can tell you that you shouldn't be lifting more then 40 pounds and do not lift anything 30 pounds or more above your head. as for everything else it's really your choice on when to tell your work. i would say if you want to wait until you are starting to show then you should tell your work around 3.5 - 4 months. I know a lot of people who worked right up until the 3rd trimester. but i think the sooner the better so that they can find a replacement by the time you are ready to leave.|`|hWc65sEtaa	You should tell them asap.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	You need to tell them now so they do not have you lifting heavy items.  Other than that you should be able to work the full term.    The only other concern is the chemicals you have to work with and breathe in.  I'd consult your doctor.|`|332dd8467b31eeba85e0c5b0ec33f75aaa	ASAP, they have to do a risk assessment on you and make reasonable changes to your job so you and your baby are not at risk, tell your manager and ask for a risk assessment, you don't have to tell anyone else if you don't want to, but its important your employer knows!|`|5DfSfyWfaa	I waited for a few weeks just so the thought could settle in and just because I didn't want to get everyone all riled up in case something went wrong. But if you've been healthy and have had no complications so far I would tell them. It's better you do it earlier so they can plan for when you're going to be wrong. Also, in case something happened to you at work it is good that they know so the correct measures can be taken.
mjTmQzvFaa	Twin A may have a hard time tolerating certain formulas, call the pediatrician and have that checked out, it could be as simple as that , but I pray too that it isn't some possible health reason past the tolerating different formulas. Good luck to you . Babies are a true joy. My thoughts are with you .|`|YW72TLapaa	Twin A might be having trouble tolerating the same formula, talk to your pedi he should evaluate the babies and tell you if twin A needs a different formula and if his weight is normal...
NGiPsLGUaa	I just took my 13 week old on Jetblue this weekend to Florida.  She loved looking at the TV.  I breastfeed so I fed her during take off and landing to help her ears pop.  I wouldn't give him medicine.  A pacifier is nice too.  My daughter loved being carried up and down the aisle, seeing the different faces.  It's nice to stretch out.  He will feel less cramped.  Good luck!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I personally wouldn't medicate the baby for no reason.  Though my mother claims she gave us Dramamine all the time when we were kids to make us sleep when we were traveling.    I think with a baby that young I would try to postpone a feeding a bit and then just feed him to sleep on the plane.|`|oZ3gU7htaa	Definitely a pacifier, also bottles of water or formula to keep him hydrated in the dry air inside the aircraft.  He will need to suck while taking off and landing to equalize his ear pressure.  Other than that, just make sure he has extra clothing and diapers and lots of reassurance.  He'll do fine.  I wouldn't recommend benadryl.|`|P25GuvNjaa	We took our son on a 3 hour flight when he was around six months, I tried to keep him awake while waiting for the flight, not too much to make him grumpy though and timed his bottle so he would be getting it during take off, you should definitely time his feed for take off and maybe some for landing as well as the sucking action will hopefully stop the pressure building in his ears.  He fell asleep after his feed for most of the flight, we had taken some little toys and books to keep him amused but what he really loved was listening to and looking at my ipod!  I was dreading it, i imagined he would be so bored and grumpy but he was actually very well behaved.|`|t2XOjDy4aa	I would not medicate your baby, unless he is sick. But, I have a LOT of experience with flying with babies.  Your baby is so young, that it won't even phase him.  I would just go about your usual routine.  Make sure you have a bottle handy ( or if you are breastfeeding, its defiantly handy :) ). I always try to feed the baby when the flight is taking off.  Its kind of like chewing gum for adults.   Also, try to make sure you change his diaper right before you take off. That way you don't have to change his diaper in the plane. MOST planes ( I have only been in two that did ) do not have a changing table. So, this means you will have to change him on your lap. If you are flying alone, this could prove to be a bit difficult.   Also, it will make it easier if you check your car seat with your luggage. They will not charge you extra. But, if they try to tell them  it needs to be coded just like a wheelchair.....  and then just put your baby in the stroller. You can stroll all the way up until right before you get on the plane, and then you will have to fold it down and leave it right beside the door .  Also, keep in mind that if you put shoes on your baby you will have to take them off when you go through security (No, not kidding).  And your bottles will have to be inspected..... if you have a powder formula container, it works good. That way you can just make the bottle as you go, but you will have to buy a bottle of water once you go inside.     Good luck!!! If you have any more questions for me let me know!    Good luck! I wouldn't worry too much.

1whTwTbDaa	They will know sooner than if you did a urine test, because the blood test actually will give them the exact amount of HCG in your blood, greater than 5 is considered positive, as opposed to the urine tests that only detect it after it gets to be a certain amount.

AA10730513	When he does poop, is it big and hard or like he has diarrhea or anything? And have you tried putting him on the potty when he does this?    One of my cousin's kids made a big fuss out of popping around that age. She ended up going to a psychiatrist who talked her into pooping animals for the people she loves. ... Aww, she pooped a big lion for my mom. ... But since your nephew is capable of doing it once you remove his diaper, maybe he just doesn't like how it feels against his skin. If you could get him to do it in the potty - that would be a good thing.|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	See a different doctor.  Cut out chese, white bread, white pasta, white rice.    Give him apple juice, pear juice, or if it really is bad, prune juice.  Mix it with a little water.    Switch to 100 percent whole grains.  Give him lots of pureed veggies or whole veggies.  Bananas. Fruits, etc.
l79QIWszaa	I was not impressed with my "hot sling".  My baby did not fit in it properly and I have read a lot about it causing hip displacement if used excessively.  However, regular baby carriers have been proven to cause back (spine) problems because of the weight they put on the sacrum of a growing baby.      I would say that if you choose to use one, make sure it is the right size and read or watch the directions very carefully.  When you have more than one child at home, these things may be neccessity.  With that in mind, only use a sling or carrier in moderation and if it doesn't feel right- it probably isn't right.|`|yL3b77dhaa	How big is your 11 month old?

My only guess is that they are starting to have bad dreams, because most of the time it seems like he is still asleep. (Either that or teething!)

What I usually end up doing is going in his room and putting his blanket back on and I pat his back and say, "It's ok, it's ok" and he'll usually be fine after that. The main thing is I try not to wake him up more than he already is because then it's just a nightmare to get him back to sleep and he'll cry even more.

I also never wanted my son to play with toy guns, because guns were a part of our nightmare childhood..But, it was a gun that saved us.  My brother at 17 had to shoot and kill our evil dad in self-defense to save us in front of me when he was 17 and I was 10.

Ahhhh.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Hopefully you can or did snag the one on e-bay. I'm not sure that you're going to find any in the toy stores. I wish you luck!  Hope your son has a happy birthday.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	lol No..    man, what i have to look forward to huh?  toy hunting? lol  Right now he's content with a lid to tupperwear if I give it to him lol|`|9dJpJBygaa	lol a toy milk truck !|`|mxrlZEweaa	Here's another  http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    I can't find anything else unless it's on ebay, sorry!    Good luck.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	At the educational store, with teacher supplies, we found a nice $2 chart too, on how milk is made.|`|UUpsa35Daa	I've seen them at toys r us...but that's pretty much the only place.    I'm adding a link to a google product search that you may find helpful. It lists a number of different milk trucks. Some are way too expensive but most are a reasonable price.    http://www.google.com/products?hl=en&q=t...
mx3gFmIKaa	I suggest skipping anything with hormones, both the depo and mirena have hormones.  Suggest the diaphram.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Mirena is good for up to 5 yrs; Paraguard up to 10 years, so before choosing an IUD, I would think about how long I want to wait before getting pregnant....they r expensive.    Depo shot....once every three months could be an option, it does have hormones though...
mCDopsLEaa	sounds like ear infection to me. and the draining is what is causing his cough. Let me know if i am right! :) I hope Mason is okay!!|`|gm5IE97uaa	sounds like a cold.  They will listen to his little lungs at the doctors office to make sure that he isnt congested and developing pneumonia.  He may also have an ear infection.  I didnt know this, but an ear infection can sometimes make babies cough and have runny nose.  I can't remember why, but that's what my doctor told me.     I hope your little guy will be okay!|`|SONLm2Ilaa	He just has a little cold and will probably feel crummy and want to be close to his mommy! If he's breastfeeding it won't get to bad! It should last about 5 to 7 days! Just keep giving him tylenol, hang in there!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	If his temp doesn't go up any higher I'd say just some type of bug which you really can't do anything about.  I'd say watch for congestion in the next few days as Emma had something similar and the congestion showed up later.  It took a week or so for her to get over it but we didn't go to the doctor.|`|dI1umvklaa	No sweat mama, if you could get a hold of your Dr. or a nurse for some advice, great. Otherwise, hmm is he teething? That is one reason. It will bring out a fever. If not try using some baby vics vapor rub at night, but just a little. Elevate his mattress or crib bed by placing a pillow underneath the mattress. Keep a vaporizer or humidifier on at night as well, to keep him a little clear. Cough meds and the over the counter stuff really don't work....you just got to let him ride it out. The tylenol for the fever should be fine, but if the temp doesn't go down, def. take him in to the Dr.    And believe me, your mommy instincts will kick in and you'll know what to do, so don't stress yourself out.    Good luck!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	It sounds like an upper respiratory infection.  My Mason, 4 months,  has a cough, too, and it was making him spit up quite a bit.  He's been really sad and feverish, but when I give him tylenol, he seems ok.|`|yCwPxulYaa	Sounds very similar to what my little one had.  The doctor said it was a virus and would have to run its course.  They really didn't do anything for her.      As long as his chest is clear and he doesn't have green snot, I am pretty sure that this is what they are going to tell you too.    Hope little Mason feels better!!
68c6B8dRaa	You can heat up all sorts of things in a hotel coffeepot -- soup chili oatmeal noodles etc.|`|HB38sMkfaa	fresh apples oranges bananas or canned fruit  peanut butter and jelly    dont most motels have mini fridges?? bring cheese and pre cooked meals that can be put in the microwave (most motels have those too right?)|`|ncpl2ruzaa	Maybe bring the chef boyardee sorry on my spelling, the macaroni and cheese, cups. You dont need to warm it up and its conveniet comes in a closed cup with a lid. Maybe some toddler meals that you can buy in the baby food section.|`|FplTPoAyaa	My opinion is that you shouldn't have a child that young in a place where he has no access to a hot meal.  No stove ? No freezer ? No microwave ? You should rethink your options.  An hour is not that far away for your mother and son to visit you after you have the baby.  Why would you want to subject your 19 month old baby to living in a hotel room if you can avoid it ?  Not only because of the lack of resources, but how will he have room to play and sleep ? Changing his environment so suddenly is not a good idea.  Just my opinion.
8nGZV6ufaa	I'd say anything that important to you forgotten by at least the people closest to you, in some way shape or form...YES that gives you props to cry a little bit...I say ANYTHING that important because, there have been things in my life that seems to stop the world to me...and no one else even batted an eyelash in behalf of it.  I'm sorry...and it does make me sad for you.  Take care.|`|WlywfjG1aa	Too sad ! He can cry even loudly , but tell me wife and kids may forget but even gfs and secretary has also forgotten ? Not possible !|`|2YOewnZBaa	Ya its ok!  My moms friends forgot her 40th and she remembers all of theirs. Some people just dont care, and they arent real friends.    Happy Birthday though!|`|mCDopsLEaa	of course. Happy Birthday!|`|yCwPxulYaa	Happy Birthday!!!!  Its okay to cry!|`|NBDLUOkiaa	If this is your 39th birthday and that means that you are an Aquarius and that means that you never let your emotions get in your way. So toughen up you big bulky man and stop being a sissy boy!    Oh and if this is your birthday then enjoy the last year of your thirties. I get to say goodbye to them in about two weeks. I am glad though my thirties really sucked so no crying here.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Happy Birthday to YOU  Happy Birthday to YOU  Happy BIRTHDAY dear Eddie   Happy Birthday to YOU!

It' kinda like a game for me now!|`|NSKimt1Qaa	Awww, Happy Birthday!  It is several hours since you posted this and I hope someone has remembered by now!  Maybe they were throwing you a surprise party. Well, I hope you treated yourself well today.  I think everyone deserves special treatment on their big day.  Hey, if I could, I'd send you over a homemade birthday cake, and maybe some lucky lottery tickets.  If no one still remembers your birthday, you should celebrate yourself the rest of the week.  We can have a Y!A birthday party on here for you tomorrow.  Take care!|`|dWLGK7nlaa	Eddie, I told you to plan a party for yourself!!!! I am crying I am not 39. Happy Birthday!!!!|`|0zWJlNi1aa	yeah! awww how sad|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	Its ok! i'd cry too if someone forgot my birthday!|`|gm5IE97uaa	why is this is in the baby section?|`|Dnr0Wbn3aa	YES ! that is so sad . I would cry too because it seems like no one remember you or even cares !|`|BaIWuzeiaa	It is okay to cry! Just because your birthday was forgotten doesn't mean they don't care about you! I am really bad w/ dates. I have forgotten my parents birthday's and even mine one year! I say celebrate all year long and and throw yourself a party for your 40th! :)|`|VNH5og0Aaa	yes, especially if that guy has a wife and kids...and a best friend, a mom, a dad, or siblings...    It's totally ok :)    Happy late B-day!|`|6aVtiTKiaa	Aww ... Sure, tough guys are allowed to cry sometimes too.    Happy birthday :)|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Yeah i would cry too, thats messed up!|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Yes. It hurts my heart to just hear that.      Happy Birthday.... though it may be belated.|`|BypjotRpaa	awww..happy birthday..    i cried on my 33rd..|`|vFCva8R5aa	aww poor Eddie,     Happy Birthday!    Yes it is ok to cry but I doubt it will help your odds of getting laid on your birthday.    edit: why is this in newborn & baby? Kind of random....
IDS64Eh8aa	Read " No-cry sleep solutions" by Elizabeth Pantley|`|yWlRRME2aa	Alright...first of all, very good question! While you may think that your choice in parenting made a huge impact on the way your son behaves now...I wanted to first, reassure you that on some level this may not be the case. Zachery may have just been born a needier child, not only that, but my son (he is 18 months now) went through various phases where he would be very needy for a while and the next week or month would play by himself wonderfully. So, I just wanted to tell you that first to try to help you not to worry. Anyway, back to your question.      Please note that all of the advice I'm giving is based on the practices I used on my son...hopefully it'll help you as well! When it comes to sleeping/naps, I suggest that you get your new baby into his crib (in his own room or at least not your room) at 3 months of age. That way, from an early age, he/she understands that this is the room and the place where sleeping is done. I personally used the CIO method and although it was hard, my son has never had an issue getting to sleep on his own and in his own bed. I don't remember exactly how old he was when I started doing this (I think maybe around 9 months or so), but I would let him cry for no longer than 20 minutes. And surprisingly, that's exactly how long it would take him to fall asleep if not sooner. I know people have strong opinions about this method saying that's it's damaging to the baby's trust for you, etc. but my son is perfectly healthy and normal in every aspect of life (plus he sleeps really well!).        When it comes to play, I honestly spent/spend a lot of time with my son. I'm a stay-at-home mom, so it's hard not to. While through some phases and certain days he wants me by his side every minute, for the most part, he has the type of personality where he is content on his own. So, in that aspect, I think it depends a lot on your child's personality. I can tell you though, that it may help not to rush to them every time they make a peep. When they're old enough to be mobile, allow them to come to you once in a while when they need something.        With the bottle issue, again I think some of it depends on your child personality. In my case, at about 10 months or so (when I knew his 1st b-day was nearing and he wouldn't need formula anymore...therefore, no more bottle), I started giving him is bedtime bottled filled with water instead of formula. Gradually, I would decrease the amount of water until at one point I just took it away all together. And he was perfectly fine with it!       Lol...this ended up being really long (I'm sorry), but I know how hard it can be to be a mom and how much you try to prevent bad habits, so I wanted to give you as much advice as I could! I really wish you the best and good luck with your new baby!|`|4w9gmvumaa	He's a baby!  You are supposed to soothe the baby.  You are the mommy.  Lack of human stimulation can cause long-term emotional and attachment problems in the future.  Visit this website for more information on that topic:    http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T13030...    I feel so sorry for babies whose mothers let them "cry it out."|`|yCwPxulYaa	I started from day one with my daughter to lay her down sleepy but still awake so she could learn to fall asleep on her own.  Now (most of the time) I can lay her down for a nap and she will just lay there are stare at her mobile and fall asleep. (she does fall asleep while nursing alot though).    A pacifier is also something I wish my daughter would use.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Swaddling mimics the womb and is a good soothing method  Rocking also mimics the womb and soothes  Pacifiers help to soothe    I realize those aren't self soothing...............|`|rOBTMriCaa	Do you want Zachary sleeping with you or beside you or is this something you want to change?  I understand wanting to start out differently with the new baby, I agree swaddling is an awesome thing to help newborns, but CIO in my experience does work and does help babies become more independent.  But life with a newborn might be easier if you get your almost toddler to be less dependent. (That's only if its something that you want.)

WgyGipBMaa	I have high blood pressure well.. I did when i got pregnant now i have low blood pressure.. go figure? but most of the time its not even a problem till 3rd trimester which then they will probably say bed rest and if your blood pressure doesn't go down in the beggining they will give you med safe for you and the baby.. But if your b/p stays under 160 over 100 then they will more than likely tell you not to take any med cause thats wat my OB said. hope I helped with my rambaling lol|`|P2hhUsoMaa	I think you can get pre-eclampsia which is very serious.  It can cause you to go into preterm labor.  Hopefully your blood pressure will be under control by the time you decide to have another so you don't have to worry about it.  Good Luck|`|UwqoqMzjaa	My friend has high blood pressure and is pregnant. She doesn't take medication though ;x  They just call her in for check ups more regularly than most other women and check her blood pressure.  They called her up unexpectedly a few weeks ago telling her to come down ASAP. So naturally, she worried herself sick on the way there. It was only another check up. So when they checked her blood pressure... You get the idea.  I'm sure it'll be fine, just be sure not to panic if they ask you to come down unexpectedly or they'll make an even bigger fuss xD|`|6UmRmaeWaa	The meds you are on now will change once you become pregnant. If you are diagnosed with preeclampsia they will watch you very closely. Two friends of mine had it with no complications... babies are healthy and normal. They will make you watch what you eat and what you do. Bed rest make happen but do not worry too much. You Dr. will guide you when you do decide to become prego again!|`|eVNIRAnXaa	that means you might not be elidgible to use the drugs so your gonna have to go through all that pain!|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Well a high risk pregnancy. Strokes, heart attacks, death for you and or babies are most common complications.|`|mxixfE3Raa	My mum had high blood pressure before and during her pregnancy and she was in and out of hospital all the time.  My sister was born 10 weeks early. There were alot of complications.|`|nTuFIKUAaa	When the time comes for you and your partner to start trying again be sure to notify your Dr. and they will most likely either switch your medication to one safe for a fetus, or you will be completely off the meds. and have to follow special dietary habits.   I had preeclampsia with my first and worried when I found out I was pregnant again, but according to my Dr. with a second or subsequent pregnancy (even with high blood pressure to start) you only have a 25% chance it will reoccur, which for women like us is good news.   Just relax and don't stress until you start to try. until then just be careful and use BC every time.
1whTwTbDaa	My pupps rash was not really raised bumps...it was awfully itchy though. Of course since you haven't got stretch marks yet, it sounds like you are about to experience them, you get really itchy when your skin is about to break....good luck with that!|`|ujd4RMR7aa	You have herpes.

TdrgZwnoaa	If your son is lactose intolerant that may be a sign of future medical problems and he should be monitored as he gets older. Thankfully, most children do grow out of this phase.   Our son did not. At age 20 he developed late onset Chrones Disease.|`|4w9gmvumaa	No, just until his digestive system matures enough.  Adults can be lactose intolerant but it doesn't cause vomiting; sometimes diharrea though.|`|780ByZVEaa	some kids at a certain age will grow out of it. Other kids just really don't.  I have jet to meet the kids that don't grow out of it!|`|zwctZ812aa	No, it doesn't.  My son is lactose intolerant now (8 months) and the doctor said it is rare that it last through adulthood.  Obviously some babies will just be lactose intolerant, but most will grow out of it by about a year of age.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That's not lactose intolerance, that's an allergy.   Lactose intolerance is an adult issue and is identified by the loose stools, not projectile vomiting.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Infants are NEVER lactose intolerant. Breatsmilk contains far more lactose than cows milk, and a baby who was lactose intolerant would be unable to tolerate his natural food. (True lactose intolerance in infants is a VERY rare metabolic condition called galactosemia.  If your baby had it, you would have figured it out long before 8 months. He would have been unable to tolerate breastmilk or formula from birth.)     A baby who vomits from dairy products is usually allergic to dairy -- the allergy is to the proteins, not the sugars.    Babies who are allergic to cows milk products often do outgrow the allergy, but you'll have to avoid them completely for the forseeable future, to allow his system to mature.|`|THuplVHpaa	He could be lactose intolerant... you might want to check with his physician. They would be able to tell you better than anyone on here.|`|8hYKIRWiaa	no it doesn't, lots of babies will outgrow their allergy by the time they are 2 or 3|`|WwCBomTMaa	I think it just all depends on the child. It is also something that can run in families. See if you can pin point people in your family who are lactose intolerant. If there aren't any, or if it only goes back to say your third or fourth cousin, chances are he will grow out of it.|`|ZJFjCdYXaa	I was lactose intolerant as a baby and was switched to soy formula at 4 months old. At 8 years old I had to go for a test that I breathed into a tube to test if I was truly lactose intolerant. I was. I've yet to outgrow it at 20 years old and my son is lactose intolerant also. There is a chance he could outgrow it, but he has worse symptoms than I do. Only time will tell, but there is a possibility of it going either way, either he will or won't. There really isn't a way to tell right now. Good thing you found out sooner than later. My son was suffering from not being able to have bowel movements at 2 months old all the way up to being a year and a half! I followed doctor's advice to not switch his milk, only as a last resort. Well that finally did the trick, but he developed a hernia from straining to go for so long. Hope that helps! Take care of the little boy!|`|nBlSS6HUaa	No it doens't mean he will be Lactose intolerant the rest of his life. My daughter was around 8 months old when she was finally diagnosed with being lactose intolerant. And she too was on Isomil Soy. Her daughter didn't want her re-tested till she was 18 months. And we tested her for about 4-5 days and she did fine on cows milk. ANd shes fine to this day and she's 22 months. Just make sure when you start feeding him solids, that you read ALL labels!! It's a little annoying, but if he's truly allergic then he won't be able to handle ANYTHING that says it contains 'milk, dairy, whey, cream, and theres a C word and I can't think of it.." but anyway...you will have to buy special butter for him that is made with soy. And he will either have to stay on Soy formula or goto a 'Rice Dream milk' or another Soy milk. But he should out grow it. It's very common among the USA.   If you need any menu ideas or anything feel free to contact me. Cugini2006@yahoo.com|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Not necessarily. My 8 year old had to be given rice milk from 2 months to 18 months, due to lactose and allergies to soy. At 18 months my doc suggested trying her back on milk. She did fine.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	Actually Ethel and Pippen have it right. This isn't lactose intolerance. It sounds more like an allergy. Dairy allergies are different from lactose intolerance. A dairy allergy is an extreme sensitivity to the proteins in dairy products, while lactose intolerance is caused by a lack of lactase enzyme, which helps the body digest dairy products. Dairy allergies can range from mild indigestion to anaphylaxis, which is life threatening.The problem with most formula {either cows milk based or soy based} is they contain something called casein. If your son is allergic to casein he would need to be on a formula that does not contain it. Also the aluminum content in soy formula is sky high so be careful that that isn't also the problem.     But yes, maybe you should rush back to his pediatrician and tell him he doesn't know what hes talking about. He's only human and they aren't God. They don't know everything.
siDcjgJCaa	Any thing really: My daughter is on some puree but mostly table food she eats, toast, avocado, all fruit except for strawberries and citric fruits and all veggies except for broccoli (because of gas) and beans. She also just started on soft noodles. Her favorite is sweet potatoes. We will introduce some cheese this month too...     If you make them small enough and easy to mash up with her gums she should be fine.. teeth have nothing to do with eating at this stage. They mash it all with their gums any ways.    My daughter is 7 months old..|`|2YOewnZBaa	At 8 months my daughter had no teeth and she ate EVERYTHING, like i mean everything. She even ate her food faster then a 12 month old with a mouthful.    If u nervous about chokin just give her smaller pieces of food, the size of her thumb nail. She will enjoy eating finger foods.    I dont really go by stages on the jars myself, I feed my daughter what I THINK shes ready to eat. Shes 9 months old and eats bascically everything and had adult food for dinner,(she cries if i dont share lol). and shes perfectly fine. She only just got her 2 bottoms btw.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Teeth are irrelevent.  What matters is her ability to pick food up and put it in her mouth.  She will gum up her food until she gets molars, which won't be until well past a year -- and you aren't going to want to keep her on mush until then.    So ... anything soft enough to gum up and/or small enough to swallow whole with only minimal gumming is fine.  You could offer fruits and cooked veggies, egg yolks (she has allergies, so be cautious with the whites), cheese (she's fine with dairy since she's had yogurt), cheerios, crackers (they'll soften in her mouth), rice, pasta, potatoes, small bits of meat/poultry ... lots of options there.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	As long as the food is small and soft she won't choke.  Try giving her bananas, cheese (I use shredded to start), cheerios, avacado, grapes, rice, noodles, egg yellows (no whites).    Pretty much anything natural and healthy that you eat, as long as it's soft and cut into small bits.|`|EcqrbLz0aa	potatos mac and cheese and jello you could try tuna if you smash it to make it smaller and she wont choke

I just wouldn't use it as a boy's name.    Maybe try    Jordan Dane Chavez    Jordan Drew Chavez    Jordan Reily Chavez    Jordan Rowan Chavez    Or use Jordan as his middle name. You really aren't LIMITED...think SYLLABLES and run with that.  Make sure it flows that way....and you are set.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Jordan Chavez is really cute, but Rex makes it look like he was named after your dog. It doesn't really flow. What is your boyfriend's first name or maybe do a middle name that starts with R.|`|uDOVf2vvaa	I really like that name, it is different and I like that because it makes it stand out. Good luck!|`|eD0MVJxUaa	I like it!|`|QzBgeyKeaa	Rex , rhymes with S-E-X ... Why not Roy , Ron , Ryan or something better|`|ZvFamJM8aa	that sounds good 2 me|`|l79QIWszaa	I love the name Jordan.  Doing a unique middle name is always a great idea because you can be creative and it still won't be something that everyone uses all the time.    Great choice!|`|WOYKcCB9aa	i think thats a great strong name and iam sure that he will thank u in years to come:>|`|224HLZXdaa	I love it. At the school I work at we have a Jordan with a Hispanic last name and we all love it.|`|kX9sbA7Daa	Sorry, but Rex is not a name for a human in my opinion. Not only is it a dog's name, it's a latin word rarely used as a name. And it just sounds wrong. Sorry    Jordan is okay though.|`|vw7ebwgnaa	I don't really like Rex at all. It does mean 'king" which is kind of cool. I would try using the dad's first name as the baby's middle name if possible. I love the Jordan though!
uhj76Fkpaa	There's not much for you to do.You could report it and maybe teachers can prevent it.Otherwise you should act like nothing happened and if you look good topless maybe it'll work well for you!  Good luck anyway|`|C5pVfdzwaa	If they do that, call the cops.  They don't have the right to do that.  Talk to yuor parents and have them talk to the school.|`|2ynZARB4aa	exactly.  laugh it off.  dont let her kno its going to hurt you, just be like ok well maybe people can see how sexy i am underneath these clothes and lol and they will feel more stupid for helping you along then.  Or say things like o i wanted to spread my pic around, maybe pic up some hot guys so thanks! O or are you a lesbian and going to keep the pics for urself? Either way is cool, i'd rather u post it around tho! And just keep happy and smile and pretend it's all god. they wont do it.   If you reported it, and they do it, when the pic shows up they will get busted. Then all u have to do is walk with a hugh head and pretend u like it.    Girl below me you are a weirdo|`|ouXbJLbOaa	get an embarrising pic of her and tell her if she shows anyone that pic, that youll show the whole school the pic you have of her.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Check to see if they have myspace accounts etc.  If you see any photos of you file a police report.    Document everything you have done.  Who, what, when and where.  You will need this info if you have to sue their parents and them.    As for keeping photos of you from floating around nothing you can do about that until they make a move.  It will be embarrassing but you will have money for your college fund if you document and keep filing complaints and police reports.    Tell the school you want to file sexual harassment charges for them looking over the stall at you while dressing.  This is sexual harassment even when done by a female to another female.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	tell everyone she must have a crush on you if she's trying to get a look at you topless :)    actually i'd probably start telling some people that now that she was trying to see you naked like a pervert, that might shame her into keeping that photo private|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Get school security involved.|`|P25GuvNjaa	You should call the police|`|mxrlZEweaa	If they did take a picture of you naked and send it out they could get in trouble for child pornography because you are underage. Make sure you not only talk to your coach but also to your principle and your parents. Your principle could send out notices that if anything "indecent" comes out that the people could get in a lot of trouble for spreading the pictures around. They don't have to name names but a general notice about it.|`|8chxrFFQaa	If they do spread it round the teachers will know and they will get in trouble. So, the only way they won't get found out is to not spread it round school.    You should go to the headteacher as they others aren't doing anything. Taking pictures of people naked without consent is taking advantage of their human rights, which makes it almost illegal. Don't stop until you get justice!    Good luck!!|`|mzFUWq8iaa	play it cool. pretend like nothing ever happened and if they do spread the pics around just say thats not me, they probably photo shopped my face on that.|`|14pjwQPLaa	So, why didn't you tell them she took the memory card out?  That would have made a great deal of difference, don't you think?    If the photos start spreading, then she's automatically guilty, because she said that she didn't take them.  In that case, she could actually be arrested for dissemination of child pornography.  Wouldn't THAT be fun!|`|74d8704d3b9fcff9814b477383d60eafaa	Well that sucks, Ive never had that happen to me, but if it does, laugh it off or something, dont let it get to you cuz thats what they want!!|`|8BkYHmOPaa	assuming you are under 18, tell them that if they put it around the school they will be guilty of distribution of child porn0graphy, which is a felony, and make sure they know that you will go to the police. try to get the pictures back by telling them they are in possession of child porn0graphy, which is also a felony.|`|aNtlzmAHaa	OMG thats horrible! i am 13 and if that happened 2 me i would be mortified! i suggest you pretend u have some dirt on her and then tell her "i will tell everyone ur secret if u spread that picture around." that will prbly get her 2 shut up and leave u alone! ;) i hope so!!!!!|`|wlyjqA5eaa	don't panic..bet they won't do anything about it..  just act cool with it  they'd jus be like k abort plan she does'nt care  (reverse phsycology)  or if they still do..take revenge!!|`|XXw7DUDRaa	exactly.  laugh it off.  dont let her kno its going to hurt you, just be like ok well maybe people can see how sexy i am underneath these clothes and lol and they will feel more stupid for helping you along then.  Or say things like o i wanted to spread my pic around, maybe pic up some hot guys so thanks! O or are you a lesbian and going to keep the pics for urself?

Then all u have to do is walk with a hugh head and pretend u like it.|`|onMxrIzHaa	u rele cant do anything but if i were u i would tell my mum and go to the princable and to her parents to get to the bottom of this and if they do spread it then can like get expelled or suspended and i dont think they're that dum to do that so rele maybe they're just trying to scar u and blackmail u but actuall they wont do anything!!!|`|3varN1KKaa	get them back make something up lol
4oCADms6aa	She's four.  Why does she have so much control?  Don't give her candy or fast food anymore.  She'll get hungry, then she'll eat her breakfast and her dinner.  As for the pacifier, take it away from her.  She doesn't need it.  I'm sure she'll throw a fit, but she'll get over it.  (I have found it very effective to make a child go to either their room or  corner while having a fit.  That way you don't have to listen to it, at least not as much as if she were screaming her bratty head off three feet in front of you.)  As for running to her mother, let her.  If she doesn't listen to you, then stop watching her.  I don't mean to sound harsh, but this is all common sense stuff.  Stop letting a four year old decide what she will and will not do, and force her mother to step in and do her job.  Any other sitter would not put up with this and you shouldn't, either.|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	This is not your business or your job. You sound like a jealous sibling rather than a concerned care giver. If she runs to your mom when you try to correct her then obviously your mom is home some. The pacifier is a personal choice and up to your mom to decide when to take it. As far as her diet is concerned I have never seen a 4 year old buy or prepare their own food, nor have I seen them purchase their own candy. At four years of age your diet is controled by your care giver so don't blame a 4 year old for poor diet choices and eating too much candy. What 4 yr. old wouldn't eat candy all day and skip meals if the people in charge allowed it to happen.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	your mother needs to take care of this...not you dear. She won't listen to you because you are not her mother.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	if you stop feeding her the fast food and candy shell eventually ge thungry and eat something else. also, when shes rude take a toy away for the week. she will eventually learn that when she is disrespectful, she will get  atoy taken away and she will stop.     as for the pacifier, theres not much you can do. its a sign that she was weened to early|`|BM7g41IBaa	Because candy is delicious.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    This sounds like it may be implantation bleeding, 1 in 3 woman experience this, and it happens when the egg attaches to the lining of the uterus.  Some people can get symptoms early on because the hormones rushing around can cause you to feel sick and a little nauseous because its something new happening to your body.    Early on in my pregnancy when i didn't know i was pregnant i got very sore boobs, heavy also, nausea and backache.  It took me 8 negatives before i got a positive because my body took ages to produce high hcg levels, and it worked out i started getting these symptoms a few weeks after i conceived.  Hope this information helps.  Best of luck xx|`|gwuTKiNXaa	it's kind of early for some of the sign. the bleeding could be implantation bleeding. I would try to stay claim because as a women I know that our mind can plan tricks on us especially when we are tryin got conceive
thoMmZAvaa	First of all you aren't incorrect that the 'cheaper' formula is the same as the name brands out there. I wouldn't however, be necessarily offended that they're ill informed and displaying typical behavior in our culture (believing name brands to be somehow better and to some degree viewing affording these with their own financial/personal status in the larger society). If they're willing to provide the extra money, then let them. If he or she brings this up again to you as a means of putting you down or conveying your lack of parenting skills, remind them that all manufactuers here in the U.S. are required to meet federal standards in creating and making products. That they are not only tested regularly, but also the manufacturing sites are inspected from year to year. That guidelines are in place for not only most products in the U.S., but without a doubt specifically for baby products (including formula). As for the saving money for your child, ask them to pay for at least half the cost of the formula (check out warehouse stores-BJ's, Sam's, etc.- or online to see if you can buy them cheaper) retail (at target) and put what money your saving (though only paying half and buying through speciality stores) and what's remaining after you make your purchases away for your child. I can understand how you might take his views as a affont to your parenting, but really allowing yourself to be offended or become upset over something that's about them (not you) isn't going to be helpful to anyone. Good luck.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	All formula, by law, has the same basic ingredients.  Target brand formula helpfully compares itself to major brands on it's own label.  Trust me, I discussed this with my pediatrician.      Here's more details on the subject:  http://www.wisebread.com/why-theres-no-r...    If his mother wishes to give you money for your child, she can do so, but you should get to spend it as you feel is best.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	yes that is very offensive. tell him to tell his mother you say, "thanks for the thought, but Tristen is doing just fine on this formula". I admit I used to think the generic brands werent as "safe" and as "nutritious" but then I realized theyre all the same. so I was guilty of this too, as I told my SIL who gives my niece costco brand, this. I use similac on my daughter but if I did start out using Target brand, I would just stick with it. It's a myth that generic brands are not as good/safe. They are all the same. And how rude of them to think that you are costing your daughter's health (which you are not!) to save money.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i think they are just misinformed....try finding something to compare the two ( a can of each) or a doc's note stating that the target formula is just as nutritious; i think they are just concerned for your baby, maybe not showing it the 'right' way, but it is very good that they care; so many don't...we can afford the brand name, but it is a waste of money when generic is sooo much cheaper and virtually the same thing|`|780ByZVEaa	yes everybrand is just as good they all have the same things in it!!  As long as your baby is tolerant for it your good.  Tell grandma to back off and if she wants to start buying the formula she can buy what ever she wants!!!|`|uN1zCMmjaa	i would be! i would just tell her very calmly and not with attitude that its none of her business and its your choice what formula she is on, not theirs. as long as your daughter lives with you. very calmly and nicely i would tell them to f off.   but thats just me.|`|AA12251362	Yes I would be offended. I breastfed my daughter so I didn't have a formula issue but I think if anybody makes comments like this about anything to do with your daughter's well being they are definitely crossing the line.|`|njLVIp55aa	I would be offended and you are justified to feel this way..Tell ur baby's daddy you dont want his MOMMY's help and for his information the Walmart and Target brand formulas are EXACTLY the same...maybe they shoyld try reading the back of the can where it is compared to Similac....    Tell them to back off and if he has such a problem with it tell him to start paying for it and stop mooching off his mom!|`|TqOdbhNAaa	The Target brand has the exact same ingredients as Similac Advance so you should tell your husband and his mother that.  I don't know if I would be offended, per se, but definitely annoyed that they questioned my choice of formula for my child.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	Take the money, pocket the difference and continue what you're doing.  Screw them!|`|WwCBomTMaa	Sounds like MOMMA'S BOY needs to take a step back and have a reality check. I would be seriously offended by this. First of all, unless your doctor tells you that the brand is unsafe for your daughter don't switch. Second of all, you should tell them that they have no say in this. The mother probably didn't even have the types of formula's we have now. When was the last time she had a baby? I highly doubt she knows what she is talking about. Both her and her son are trying to make it sound like you are a bad mother. If the target brand was unsafe they wouldn't manufacture it!! As long as you follow your motherly instincts you don't need advice from that nut factory.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	Volks: did she ask about breastfeeding or the mortality rate of formula fed infants? no, she didn't. take your zealot propaganda elsewhere.    I hate to say it, but the person above me is totally right. Tell her how much the name brand stuff costs per month, but what you've been buying and pocket the difference. mommy's boy should be paying for it anyway. I'm sure you could use the extra money considering YOU are the one raising your child with him!|`|siDcjgJCaa	Yea I would be offended.. only because I am a bit controlling when it comes to my daughter... But in the end.. its free formula for you....|`|mgLb5Yohaa	Little do they know that ALL American made formulas are heavily regulated and scrutinized by the FDA. That is why we, (Thank, the Lord), were excluded from that Chinese formula scare.     Store brand name formulas, or any other food, is not flawed! Almost always they have the same ingredients as the expensive brand names.     I would educate the estranged father and egotistical mother in law that you've done your research, and you feel comfortable leaving your healthy and strong daughter on the formula you've been providing...thank you very much!|`|8t8NjjnVaa	The Target brand is just as good as any name brand formula.  There are strict guidelines that all formula makers in the U.S. have to adhere to in terms of nutritional makeup.    As far as it not being "safe"...well no formula is really 'safe'.  As I'm sure you've heard, there were the melamine recalls in China, but so far, no dangerous levels have been found in U.S. produced formulas, even the generic brands.      However, there have been many many other recalls over the years for other reasons, and they affect major name brands just as often as generic brands.  There have been recalls from things like glass particles (Nutramigen by Mead Johnson) and salmonella contamination, and spoilage organisms (Carnation Good Start by Nestle).      That, and just the simple fact that formula fed infants have 7 times the mortality rate of breastfed infants.      But when comparing one formula to another, they're all the same.|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	I might be a little offended, but ultimately, I'd probably just roll my eyes and move on. They're the ones with the problem, not you, so just try to laugh it off. How do they know that Target's formula is not good? Have they done as much research as you? Doubtful. Don't let it get to you.|`|2MKvrydWaa	yes i would be offended b/c nobody should tell u how to raise your child and tell u what is best for her(besides a doctor).i breastfeed and i don't like hearing i should put my baby on formula all the time.I'M THE MOMMY.and u should be able to tell his mother that 2 just in case she forgot.but all in all if u want to go with her idea u will at least get free formula out of it:-)|`|9iDhKZ1Oaa	I would be offended. I would just tell him "no". simple as that. and you can tell his mother "no" as well, that it is not their decision to make, and that she shouldn't be paying for her son's child's formula in the first place- he should. That is absolutely rediculous. I would definitely be offended and very angry. What an immature ignorant @sshole.|`|AA10811784	That is just ridiculous! Sounds as if his mother has some controlling issues, that is what it comes down to. My daughter was on Walmart brand formula and never once had any problems.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Yes I would be offended....and I would tell them to mind their business.  There is no difference between the brand names and the store brands other then price IMO.  We have been using Parents Choice since my son was 2 months old and he has had no problems and is 8 months now.    It's almost the same as someone telling me that I shouldn't be worried about the cost of a new car seat because my son's safety is more important.  In my opinion if it is on the market, it is safe to use...I hate when people put their 2 cents in.
S1gJJHNzaa	i was still getting positive tests 8 weeks after my miscarriage and i was only 6-7 weeks along when it happened.    your best bet is go ahead and take one but if it's positive don't do the happy dance yet.. have blood drawn then two days drawn again to see if your hcg is going up or down.    i'm sorry for your loss, i know your pain|`|S3WeYrVgaa	It really depends on your hormone levels.  It took between 6-8 weeks for mine to go down (took 8 weeks for my period to come).  I had regular blood tests done at my Dr's office to check my hormone levels though.  I knew somebody who had to take pregnancy tests weekly and wait for them to no longer show positive for her to know that her levels had gone down.  If you took one it is possible for it to show positive still from that m/c.  If it does show positive you can just place a call to the Dr's office and have them do a blood test and they could also set you up with a sono depending on what it shows.|`|H74F8jxuaa	I would wait until you are 8 weeks passed the miscarriage because it can take a while for your hormones to level out.  I miscarried in sept and it took 5 weeks and 6 days to get my period back and have been trying ever since then.  If you go 8 weeks and no period, you may have to take a pill to get you ovulating again (that is what my dr. told me).|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Aww huni I am sorry about your miscarriage.    I miscarried 3 days ago at 19 weeks and I haven't a clue how long my tests will be positive for..    It all depends on the gestation of the pregnancy... when I miscarried at 4-5 weeks the test was negative the next day.. When I miscarried at 6 weeks it took 5 days to go back to negative.    You could take one tommorow and see what it says, I doubt 7 weeks later it would be positive hun, but if it were you could see your GP for HCG tests to check the HCG was rising not falling and they could then tell you if you were indeed pregnant again.    I am wishing you so much luck there is nothing harder than a miscarriage! I am struggling so much at the moment, Last time I miscarried I was pregnant again 14 days later but I highly doubt that will happen this time as I was almost 5 months.    xxxxx
oA8Rtyxuaa	Those little gums of theirs are pretty strong, so I wouldn't worry too much about her not being able to mush things up with them, just be close by at all times in case she has a problem (duh, i know i just had to say it though!)     She should be able to eat canned green beans, peas, cooked carrots, fruits (even if she doesn't seem to like them, keep giving them to her, eventually she will start to eat them) pears, peaches, pineapple, avocado, banana, yogurt, toast sticks, pancakes, crackers, cooked pasta, cooked meats cut up fairly small, cheese cubes, grilled cheese...just a few ideas.    Feed her until she stops eating it and starts playing, babies only eat until they are full, sometimes it takes them forever to eat though! be patient and always give her her milk after she has eaten her food. Milk is very filling so if she drinks it first she will fill up on that and not eat the food! Good luck!|`|kmQqbxpQaa	I know when my son turned one, he became more of a snacker than a 3 day meal person.  He still (like your baby) drank 24-32 oz of whole milk, a couple of gerber foods (mainly carrots and green beans), but I also added solids duing family meal time.  I would chicken, ham, bacon, etc.  Of course, my son had all of his teeth by one (so I know understand you worrying about her choking).  Have you tried canteloupe, watermelon, and honey dew for fruit?|`|FplTPoAyaa	Have you tried her on yogurt ? My baby hardly eats any fruits also, but she likes the Yo Baby yogurt, and it comes in peach, pear, banana, and blueberry.  Also, Gerber makes easily dissolvable snacks, such as yogurt bites.  You can break them in half and they will quickly dissolve in her mouth, as will zwieback toast.  Just be careful with the toast, as when she gets close to the end of it, she may try to eat it whole (my baby did).  I always stay right with her when she eats it. Good luck !!|`|vue9NOhYaa	At this age you really don't need to be 'feeding her' at all. Regardless of her number of teeth, she can probably be self-feeding, and eating table foods. There's no logical reason for her to eating jars of gerber. (If nothing else, it must be getting VERY expensive.). She can gum up just about anything.     Stop the mush, and offer her table food.  At regular meal times and a couple of snacks, cut up some of what you are eating (or offer something simple and age appropraite, like fruit or healthy dry cereal, or yogurt) and let her eat what she wants of it. When she's had enough, she'll stop eating.  If you're having pork chops, potatoes, and brocolli, SHE can have pork chops, potatoes and brocolli.     5 cups of whole milk is WAY too much for a toddler.  It's going to fill her up and leave less room for the healthy mixed diet she needs to be eating. Generally a toddler should have 16-20 ounces of whole milk per day.|`|ncpl2ruzaa	Wow i cant believe that person said that, kids these days. Have you tried giving her bananas? my son loves these and stage 2? I would think at one stage 3 is what you should be giving her. Stage 3 foods are mushy with bigger chunks it them, that their gums are able to chomp smaller. She needs to learn to chew try buying a couple stage 3's. It wouldnt hurt to try. Also Mac and cheese is a good mushy food, they actually have that in stage 3 baby foods as well. You can also try little chopped up pieces of chicken or eggs. At age one i was told by my pediatricion that my son could eat anything, but no to give them honey.    And honestly my son was eating chicken and cherios and such at 1, even though he didnt have that many teeth either he still found ways to mush it up with his gums or suck on the cherios till they were soft
yJZeRu5Vaa	wait till tomorrow and if shes not better take her back to the doctor. it actually doesnt sound bad since the meds are helping her fever. try giving her some asprin for her headache, or motrin|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I know it's hard to see your child sick, but the antibiotic has to run it's course, give her some tylenol for the pain and try and let her sleep.  She probably does have strep like they said, red sore throat is not the only form of it.  Rashes, on her body and face can also be another strain.  On top of the strep she could have a virus, which really has to run it's course.  Her temp isn't too high at 99.7 - keep her hydrated, lots of fluid, some soup, and like I said keep her comfy.   Good Luck|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	I would go to a different ER, preferably one that deals with children.  In order to 100% identify strep they have to do a strep test. You know your child best, if this is something that you know just isn't right then you need to do what is best for her.  Strep doesn't always manifest itself with a sore throat in young children, the symptoms sometimes identified are headache or stomachache.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Take her to the emergency room immediately and make some demands.      Strep throat is very common among kids and teens. Symptoms of strep throat include fever, stomach pain, and red, swollen tonsils.    Strep throat usually requires treatment with antibiotics. With the proper medical care  along with plenty of rest and fluids  your child should be back to school and play within a few days.    How Strep Throat Spreads  Anybody can get strep throat, but it's most common in school-age kids and teens. These infections occur most often during the school year when big groups of kids and teens are in close quarters.    The bacteria that cause strep throat (group A streptococcus) tend to hang out in the nose and throat, so normal activities like sneezing, coughing, or shaking hands can easily spread infection from one person to another.    That's why it's so important to teach kids the importance of hand washing  good hygiene can lessen their chances of getting contagious diseases like strep throat.    Strep Throat vs. Sore Throat  Not all sore throats are strep throats. Most episodes of sore throat  which can be accompanied by a runny nose, cough, hoarseness, and red eyes  are caused by viruses and usually clear up on their own without medical treatment.    A child with strep throat will start to develop other symptoms within about 3 days, such as:    red and white patches in the throat   difficulty swallowing   tender or swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck   red and enlarged tonsils   headache   lower stomach pain   fever   general discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling   loss of appetite and nausea   rash   Diagnosis  If your child has a sore throat and other strep throat symptoms, call your doctor. The doctor will likely do a rapid strep test in the office, using a cotton swab to take a sample of the fluids at the back of the throat. The test only takes about 5 minutes.    If it's positive, your child has strep throat. If it's negative, the doctor will send a sample to a lab for a throat culture. The results are usually available within a few days.    Treatment  In most cases, doctors prescribe about 10 days of antibiotic medication to treat strep throat. Within about 24 hours after starting on antibiotics, your child will probably no longer have a fever and won't be contagious. By the second or third day after taking antibiotics, the other symptoms should start to go away, too.    Even if your child feels better, he or she should finish the antibiotics as prescribed. If your child stops taking antibiotics too soon, bacteria can remain in the throat and the symptoms can return.    If your child is not treated for strep throat, he or she is most infectious when the symptoms are the most severe but could remain contagious for up to 21 days. Lack of treatment  or not finishing the prescribed course of antibiotics  also could put your child at risk for other health problems, such as rheumatic fever (which can cause permanent damage to the heart), scarlet fever, blood infections, or kidney disease.    To prevent your sick child from spreading strep throat to others in your home, keep his or her eating utensils, dishes, and drinking glasses separate from those that everyone else is using. Wash them in hot, soapy water after each use. Also, make sure your child doesn't share food, drinks, napkins, handkerchiefs, or towels with other family members.    Make sure your child covers his or her mouth and nose during a sneeze or a cough to prevent passing infectious fluid droplets to someone else. Also, throw out your child's toothbrush after the antibiotic treatment has been started and he or she is no longer contagious, and make sure your child uses a new one.    Caring for Your Child  You can help your child feel better while battling strep throat. Provide plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration, such as water or ginger ale, especially if he or she has had a fever. Avoid orange juice, grapefruit juice, lemonade, or other acidic beverages that can irritate a sore throat. Warm liquids like soups, sweetened tea, or hot chocolate can be soothing.    As recovery progresses, talk to your doctor about when your child can return to school and other routine activities.|`|eeGN977eaa	This makes me think of when my youngest daughter was an infant. She had a rash on her bottom. I took her to the doc over and over and they prescribed numerous ointments. I told them that she may have been exposed to Staph and they said it wasn't Staph. Finally I demanded that they test her for it and low and behold I was right.    I would take her to a different doctor or the ER and explain all of this to them. Tell them you would be more comfortable if they ran more tests because you are very concerned. But just like everyone else, doctors don't like to be told how to do their jobs so I wouldn't be specific about exactly what tests you want to be performed.     I hope she feels better soon. Great job on keeping a close eye on her temp and symptoms.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I'd call the pediatrician and tell them you want testing done - then go to the ER.  I'd only call the pediatrician first because it might help you in the ER if its dr prescribed testing.|`|mCDopsLEaa	I would do what you feel in your gut. Your little girl isn't getting better. If I was in the same situation I would go back to the ER. Call her pediatrician first to see what he says.|`|HtpRBMFraa	ER but request a specialist they should have one on call if not on premises. Better safe than sorry and mom's know their kids better than anyone. Keep at them until you feel she is better.|`|UwhyTsCKaa	Take an ice bath with her, a lot of vitamin C, a lot of rest, feed her stuff isn't isnt hard to digest. Lets go back to the basics please.|`|oS70PnhIaa	I would go and see another doctor.|`|0td65n04aa	I would try giving her some Tylenol and see if it helps with the pain.  If it doesn't then I would go back to the ER.  I would explain to them the fact you have been having to help her to the bathroom, etc and push until they listen.  Sometimes doctors forget how well we know and understand our own children.  Trust your instincts.|`|4oCADms6aa	Give it time.  The fever's down, so the medicine is probably working.  Give her some Advil for her headache, soothe and comfort her, and wait it out.  If she's not better by the time the weekend's over, then take her back to the doctor's office.  By the way, Strep is not always manifested by a sore throat.  It's an infection that can settle just about anywhere in the body.|`|gUxpwEXbaa	My, I would be freaking out by know! Id take her to ER, yes, or Id look for second opinion. The headaches seem pretty bad its not normal. Something must be wrong. I wouldnt take its nothing serious for an answer.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	The flu is pretty wicked and the biggest symptom that I've been hearing about is headache. If it were me I'd wait it out - make her rest and be sure she's drinking plenty of liquid (preferably a sugar drink like juice). If her blood sugar drops from her not eating or she gets dehydrated she'll get a headache.

LsAArkUyaa	There is a lot of really bad advice here.  First of all. Never ever put anything in the crib with your baby. Toys, blankets etc all pose suffocation risks.   Pillows, blankets and soft toys should all be avoided until your baby is much older.    Have you looked at co-sleepers. Basically it is a crib or bassinet that goes up against the side of your bed. Most can be converted into a regular crib or bassinet if needed.    http://shopping.yahoo.com/s:Baby%20Furni...      As for those suggesting Cry It Out..... Even the supporters of CIO say 3 months is too young, especially for one with medical problems such as your DD respiratory problem.    ETA: add to the list of bad advice....I can't believe someone actaully suggested forcefully holding a pacifier in your baby's mouth. BAD BAD BAD|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Start out  by putting her in her crib during the day. She wakes up when you put her in her crib at night, because it has a different feel & scent to it. Once you begin to put her in her own crib, don't take her back into your bed until morning, after she has a dry diaper & is fed if you so choose. She'll adapt to her bed in time. Cover her with a crib blanket/comforter & also place a small "blankie" in with her & she will be comforted by its softness & scent. Leave a small nightlight on to comfort her. She'll adapt & your husband & you will sleep better too.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	i dont know my daughter is 6 months old and i'm about to do the same yeah i took long. but mine falls asleep on her own and sometimes i just feed her and lay her down and she falls asleep.. try that but they say not to put her in the crib when she's already asleep becuase she'll wake up crying wondering where she is because that's not the place where she was at first. try putting her there while she's really sleepy and tap her softly and shhh her that's what i do! i never tried it at 3 months though.. good luck|`|fe8RxYsfaa	Just keep putting her in her crib.  She will adjust.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	First start by placing the crib right by your bed so that she can feel like sleeping with you.It's almost certain that the first couple of nights she will have trouble sleeping,she will try to force you to take her back where she was before but you shouldn't do her the favor :) .She will eventually get used to it and sleep the whole night through as before!  Good luck|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Put the crib in your room so you can check her-give her naps in the crib during the day if you can. She's so little it shouldn't be hard. Don't start her off in the bed and then move her-go directly to the crib|`|FIALhwlKaa	Dont put her into your bed anymore. When she needs to sleep, she HAS to be in her bed,. The first weeks may be horrible, she will cry and you want her to be in your bed again, because its much easier to put her to sleep. Dont give up. When she sees she cant win this battle ( and it will be a battle!!! ) she will sleep in her crib. If you give up, she will stay there for a very long time! I wish you good nerves lol.|`|LWl5iiBKaa	Just put her in her own bed.Let her cry you're training her to stay in you bed by giving in.|`|qStmw7qgaa	The best way to start this is to start putting her in her crib for nap times.  That gives her a chance to get used to it.  Also, if you put her down in her crib and she wakes up...do not take her out of the crib.  If you are using a pacifier, just give that to her.  Hold it in her mouth if you need to so she doesn't spit it out.  Make sure she can feel your hand on her and hear your voice.  Once she falls back to sleep (and she will) you can leave.  The most important thing I can say though is to be patient with her.  This is not going to happen over night, and there is a good chance she could wake up a few time during the night.  That is what we had to do with our baby girl.  It was rough for a while, but it worked.|`|EL3P7YA4aa	Try putting like a blanket around her...  or something so it seems like that there  is someone in her crib with her...maybe   put a teddy bear or something close by her...  or if you have a breast feeding pillow put her in that and   let her feel like someone is holding her or laying next to  her and then take it out from under her when she is sleeping  we had the same problem with our 5 month old...     good luck :)   hope i helped lol :)|`|SONLm2Ilaa	Sometimes its best to move them before they hit the deep sleep. You may have to let her cry it out tho, try to make her crib a positive experience for her! 3 months is pretty soon to be putting her in a crib, she may feel scared bc of all the room! Maybe try a bassinet,may make her feel a little more secure!|`|Uz8BZN6daa	I'm a mother of 3, my youngest will turn 6 months tomorrow and my advice is to put her in her crib AWAKE and let her fall asleep there.  Yes, she'll cry at the beginning, but the more you keep her in bed, the more difficult for you to kick her out.  With my 3 kids, we've never allowed them to sleep w/ us.  They have slept in a bassinet next to us for the first 4 months and then off they go to their big crib in their own bedrooms.  It has worked for us the 3 times, they all sleep thru the night.  If you're still nursing her, try for your husband to be the one putting her to sleep so she doesn't "smell" you and ask for food, hence cry when you put her down.  And always keep a monitor so you can hear her from your room.  Good luck!|`|rOBTMriCaa	I know this isn't a popular response but I used the cry it out method with 2 out of my 4 children (the youngest 2) and they are much better, sounder sleepers than the older 2.  But I couldn't do that with the first 2 so I understand if you can't do it either.  One thing that can really help to is to use a "mommy shirt" take a tee shirt that you've been wearing, or if you use a certain lotion, perfume put that on the shirt and place it in the crib, especially if she's used to having half a king size bed to herself, your smell is probably what she misses most.    Give her some time to get used to the crib too, maybe using it for naps.  Good Luck!|`|ByyBIJEvaa	There are a number of ways to accomplish this if you really want to.  They all involve a few tears from the child ( and probably from you too) but take heart it can be done.  Follow this link to see how I did it.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4745543_baby-sle...

Babydust***|`|wWkfASTNaa	It is not too early to have morning sickness. Some people feel that practically instantly! One thing I would say is if you had sex the day after you ovulated, and you know 100% for sure that was when you ovulated, you may not have caught the egg in time. THe egg lives for 12-24 hours, so there is a narrow window in which to catch the egg. But if you also had sex before that, then you definately could have.  Here is a site I love, it shows the percentage of succesful pregnancies that experienced common symptoms|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	you usually dont get morning sickness untill around 3rd month into pregnancy!|`|papEAcdvaa	It's only too soon to have morning sickness when you wake up and find yourself covered in your vomit|`|780ByZVEaa	ohw yeah women can feel that before they miss their period. and if you are not sick then the throwing up is a subtle sign unless your breakfast just didn't fell right

3l9Dlidiaa	Based on your chart I would say that you are definitely pregnant.  You had a second thermal shift and your temps have been elevated longer than 18 days.      An hpt should definitely be able to show positive, however, I have read that rarely the hcg does not cross to the urine or just takes a long time.  I have heard women on here saying it took them until they were 5 weeks pregnant to get a bfp!      Demand a blood test now!  If you were not pregnant, your temps would have dropped long before now and you would have your af already.  If you get your period now it could be from a miscarriage, but I doubt it.  It is common to spot some when your first preggo.      Congratulation mommy!  Show you doc your chart and he will see why you need a blood test!|`|gwuTKiNXaa	I'm the same way I took 2 and still a negative.

Good luck, and lots of babydust!|`|o5rfI7oUaa	Wow you did alot|`|304ef3a00356e988a8cd661bcf96f680aa	Yep, it's true that some women can't get a BFP on urine test. I am one of them. I was 6 weeks pregnant and still get a BFN on my urine test, but the blood test showed up positive. I say there is still hope. Sorry you have to wait a week for your blood test. That's stinks..but welcome to the 2 week wait..
471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	We never did pureed and went straight to finger foods.|`|AA11210211	Sure you can do both but it depends on the child's age too.I say if they can sit up and if they can pick things up with their thumb and pointer finger than yes they are ready for finger foods|`|vue9NOhYaa	Doesn't really matter.  If baby is still on purees (unable to pick up food and eat it), you offer purees. Once baby is able to eat finger foods, it makes sense to move on, since it offers more variety of flavor and texture, and is less work and/or cost.  (Little jars are expensive, and home-made babyfood is a bit of a hassle.)|`|X2EPEEwbaa	Depends on how old the baby is.    I started my son on pureed foods at about 4.5 months and then gave the occaisonal finger food (cheerios, etc.) at about 6.5 months.  He now eats finger food exclusively and he is 10 months old.|`|vJEatJFPaa	How old is your baby?    Olivia is 8 months old and we give her a mixture of the 2....|`|qStmw7qgaa	My niece does both and she is 8 months.  They do the pureed food and then some cheerios or puffs or something after.  Not only does she love it, but it helps w/ her coordination.|`|kF5vdaCDaa	depends on age.. but if the baby is old enough introduce finger foods slowly but steadily. and yes you can give both.|`|siDcjgJCaa	Depending on the babies age and ability sure you can do both. However, once we started finger food and my duaghter realized she could do it herself.. she wont let me feed her with a spoon anymore.|`|52f324625365b28f39a1f5b883fa4788aa	HOw old is your baby?  You start with puree from 6 months then later progress to finger foods.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	How many teeth does he have?|`|7ERpxpFnaa	Finger food - baby led weaning is the way forward!    Your baby doesnt necessarily need 'food' at this stage, as he/she gets that from breast milk or formula.  People in this society seem hung up on 'getting baby to take as much as possible' when that really isnt what they need. (and getting them to do it as early as possible!)    When your baby gets to around 6 months they are ready to start trying foods out - getting to know tastes and textures. They cant do that if you have pureed it - they dont learn how to bite, and they dont get to know the textures or what the food really looks like.  When you give a baby a spoonful of something for the first time, their instant reaction is to push it back out again. They've done what they need to - theyve tasted it, and felt the texture, and then out it goes. Its a defense mechanism - they arent used to how it feels and the strong tastes and push it back out in case they choke on it. However, babies love to feed themselves - getting in a right mess, and learning all about food - theres also a rumour going around that babies who are weaned this way are less likely to be finicky eaters later on!     If you have breast fed your baby, they will get tastes of the food you have eaten through your milk, and therefore it may be easier to get baby to accept new foods - because in theory they already know the tastes!     This way the baby is in control of what goes in its mouth, and more likely to accept the new tastes and textures.  For the most part, as long as your baby is ready they can eat what the rest of the family eat, and you dont spend hours cooking and pureeing meals in advance and have a freezer full!  (Remember, never leave your baby alone while he/she is eating - always supervise!)    For more info, google it - theres tons of info out there, but have put the best under sources.
f5pticCLaa	You don't sound stressed to me.  I'm just like you...after ovulation I just want to talk about it.  I think it just makes us feel better to know what other people think about the situation.  Makes the days go by a bit faster when you talk about it.  Is that such a bad thing?? I say "NO".  So I'll talk about it with you hun.  I got married in June and we started TTC   1 right away on our honeymoon.  Well sure enough in July I got a BFP three days before my period was due.  I couldn't believe it...I was like are you kidding me.  I usually get sore breasts before I start my period and they didn't hurt at all.  I didn't have implantation bleeding or anything.  The only reason why I actually took a test 3 days before is because that morning I almost threw up after drinking some coffee.  That was the only sign or symptom I had before my missed period.  The day I missed my period I had slight cramping that made me nervous but it never got worse.  A week later..I was nauseated all the time and then the sore breasts kicked in.  In Sept we sadly had a miscarriage at 11 weeks....not sure why.  We actually got to see the heart beat and everything at 8 1/2 weeks.  So we are back at it again and going on month 4 of trying again.  So Yes you can get a positive and have no symptoms....my best friend found out she was pregnant in Oct and she said the morning she took her test she was sure it was going to be negative because she didn't have any symptoms at all...but sure enough she got her BFP.  Good luck to you and BABY DUST for you and me :)    Oh and by the way...email me your email address so that I can send you my wedding picks.  I was going to email you but your profile doesn't allow emails :)|`|3MDY29gnaa	Sweety please stop stressing yourself out!  You are not making yourself any better, you are just putting more stress on yourself.   The TWW is the worst thing ever i know but just wait and see if you lmiss you AF. That's the only thing you can do. Take your mind off of the symptoms every woman is different. Some have symptoms that ither never heard of.   Just wait it out hun!  Baby dust!!!!|`|smsUZG4Iaa	first of all you need to relax, it will happen only when you don't stress about it.. yes sometimes during implantation you may have light cramps . most woman don't have any symptoms for a while.. just stay positive.. Best of Luck.....

I don't like Star, which it would more than likely get shortened to. Starla is a lot nicer, and I think it would be abbreviated less.    Good luck =D|`|0dbDQh8Haa	I like it, but I wouldn't choose it. Because if your girl doesn't like it, there aren't many nicknames she could use except for "Star," which wouldn't really work for a name....|`|vtmvud6eaa	I think you should keep it simple and just call her star if you want to be different maybe spell her name Starr|`|UwdOpcCraa	i hear starling and i think of a horse sorry, star is good, what about angel, neveh, heven spelt backwords|`|GU3RauKOaa	I think its a bit out there, but its your baby! Actually, it is really cute. If you are concerned, you could always use it as a middle name. You can call her by her middle name but if she doesn;t like it when she's older she can use her first name.    Or she can just go by Star. I personally like Starr.    :)|`|FrkF7PaRaa	I don't like it....not a fan at all.|`|qUV0xKu9aa	It's out there but it's very nice, like shes floating in space, its verry pretty heres some middle names:    Starling Jessica  Starling Talia  Starling Alison  Starling Rose  Starling Meme  Starling Michelle  Starling Moon  Starling June  Starling Juno|`|F9KBwSQ4aa	awww!  its adorable! have you thought about the name starla? it's also a cute name :)|`|eBxSYUXWaa	I like it!!!

With Pica some people eat grass, dirt, flour, clay, baking soda and more. Its worse when you are pregnant!     Here is some information about it. You should look in to it. Talk to your Ob, and also talk to your Primary Dr they will be able to refer you to the right place. Let them know you think its Pica. It is!    Eating Disorder: Pica    Print ThisEmail This   Overview  Differential Diagnoses & Workup  Treatment & Medication  Follow-up  References  Keywords  Introduction  Background  Pica is an eating disorder typically defined as the persistent eating of nonnutritive substances for a period of at least 1 month at an age in which this behavior is developmentally inappropriate (eg, >18-24 mo). The definition occasionally is broadened to include the mouthing of nonnutritive substances. Individuals presenting with pica have been reported to mouth and/or ingest a wide variety of nonfood substances, including, but not limited to, clay, dirt, sand, stones, pebbles, hair, feces, lead, laundry starch, vinyl gloves, plastic, pencil erasers, ice, fingernails, paper, paint chips, coal, chalk, wood, plaster, light bulbs, needles, string, cigarette butts, wire, and burnt matches.    Although pica is observed most frequently in children, it is the most common eating disorder seen in individuals with developmental disabilities. In some societies, pica is a culturally sanctioned practice and is not considered to be pathologic. Pica may be benign, or it may have life-threatening consequences.    In children aged 18 months to 2 years, the ingestion and mouthing of nonnutritive substances is common and is not considered to be pathologic. Consider pica when the behavior is inappropriate to the developmental level of the individual, is not part of a culturally sanctioned practice, and does not occur exclusively during the course of another mental disorder (eg, schizophrenia). If pica is associated with mental retardation or pervasive developmental disorder, it must be sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. In such patients, pica typically is considered to be a secondary diagnosis. Furthermore, the pica must last for a period of at least 1 month.    Pathophysiology  Pica is a serious behavioral problem because it can result in significant medical sequelae. The nature and amount of the ingested substance determine the medical sequelae. Pica has been shown to be a predisposing factor in accidental ingestion of poisons, particularly in lead poisoning. The ingestion of bizarre or unusual substances also has resulted in other potentially life-threatening toxicities, such as hyperkalemia following cautopyreiophagia (ingestion of burnt match heads).    Exposure to infectious agents via ingestion of contaminated substances is another potential health hazard associated with pica, the nature of which varies with the content of the ingested material. In particular, geophagia (soil or clay ingestion) has been associated with soil-borne parasitic infections, such as toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract complications, including mechanical bowel problems, constipation, ulcerations, perforations, and intestinal obstructions, have resulted from pica.    Frequency  United States  Prevalence of pica is unknown because the disorder often is unrecognized and underreported. Although prevalence rates vary depending on the definition of pica, the characteristics of the population sampled, and the methods used for data collection, pica is reported most commonly in children and in individuals with mental retardation. Children with mental retardation and autism are affected more frequently than children without these conditions. Among individuals with mental retardation, pica is the most common eating disorder. In this population, the risk for and severity of pica increases with increasing severity of mental retardation.    International  Pica occurs throughout the world. Geophagia is the most common form of pica in people who live in poverty and people who live in the tropics and in tribe-oriented societies. Pica is a widespread practice in western Kenya, southern Africa, and India. Pica has been reported in Australia, Canada, Israel, Iran, Uganda, Wales, Turkey, and Jamaica. In some countries, Uganda for example, soil is available for purchase for the purpose of ingestion.    Mortality/Morbidity  Ingestion of poisons: Lead toxicity is the most common type of poisoning associated with pica. Lead has neurologic, hematologic, endocrine, cardiovascular, and renal effects. Lead encephalopathy is a potentially fatal complication of severe lead poisoning, presenting with headache, vomiting, seizures, coma, and respiratory arrest. Ingestion of high doses of lead can cause significant intellectual impairment and behavioral and learning problems. Studies also have demonstrated that neuropsychologic dysfunction and deficits in neurologic development can result from very low|`|ujd4RMR7aa	I think you just want some cupcakes.

Wow! Ask your doctor! I have never heard of this. Good luck with everything!|`|EIK4TaWoaa	It sounds like your suffering from a calcium shortage. Which would make sense because your baby is using up calcium for its bones.    Pregnant women tend to crave things their bodies need though the connection might not be obvious.    Dairy products and broccoli are good sources of calcium but of coarse talk to your doctor as soon as possible|`|EOIxLhBxaa	You can't have baking soda during pregnancy. It will cause high blood pressure and water retention. It could hurt your baby very much. I hate the taste but i take it often before pregnancy for IC but now I'm not allowed so have to deal with the pain in other ways.
215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I do day care in my home part-time for some of my former co-workers (nurses/doctors). It isn't everyday and it usually isn't all day. I did at one point have a couple children that were here full-time but there were some issues and they moved on, so I now enjoy doing it part-time.     I currently have a 2 year old, a 3 year old, a 5 year old and 7 year old.     Plus my own two children nearly 3 years and 16 months.

I provide care for 3 other children (they are all taking naps at the moment).  They are near my son's age (18-24 months).  For lunch I make things like chicken fingers, french fries, fruits and vegetables, fish sticks, PB&J, spaghettios, mac & cheese, pizza,... Snacks, I give them fruit, crackers, cheese, yogurt, etc.  I have a couple of good books that have good activities in them.  They are: The Toddler's Busy Book and The Preschooler's Busy Book by Trish Kuffner.  I charge $20/day, with a $60/week minimum.  That opens it up to people who need part-time care.  This really works for us.  Since I only care for a small group, I did not get licensed.  I work part time on the weekends to help supplement income as well.
IGwX328eaa	I used to baby sit my cousin she is 2 years old. I would give her noodles, mac and cheese, chicken, pasta (spaghetti or ravioli), or grilled cheese. snack graham crackers, goldfish crackers, string cheese, regular crackers, Popsicle, cheerios, raisins, and craisins. We would play outside on our deck run around color, draw, play with baby dolls dress them and stuff or she would help cook, puzzles, or we would walk to the park. I only charged $20 per day which was about 6 hours because shes family.|`|vJEatJFPaa	My good friend and I do a swap with our girls when we have class (we have oppostie school schedules). My DD is 8 months old and her daughter Lucy is 3 years old. Olivia and Lucy get along great. Lucy loves trying to play and help take care of her and Olivia follows Lucy around everywhere!    We don't pay each other...its kind of like were just helping each other out so we can finish school! Works out perfect...Lucy loves goldfish crackers, cheese sticks, and fruit. I always have a kids movie on hand, coloring supplies, puzzles, and toys.
PbBWJGsTaa	Honestly i think you need to eat more.  For the past 9 months i have been breastfeeding my little girl, I've found for the first time in my life, i can literally eat what i want without putting on weight.  Actually i'm losing about a pound every few weeks.  I know we're told that we need to eat around 500 more calories a day when nursing, but i wonder where on earth all my extra calories go.  Especially since my girl is so small for her age. (She nurses ever 3 hours during the day).|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I have the opposite problem - too much baby weight.   A friend of mine was too thin after having a baby. She started trying to eat more, and found one of the best ways was to have cup soups instead of tea/coffee. That's the only suggestion I can come up with I'm afraid.

You will just know when it is not a newborn anymore. When you get used to having him/her around, I would consider it not a newborn anymore.|`|kRui5wGtaa	My doctor told me that they are considered a newborn up to 6 weeks old.

oA8Rtyxuaa	Talk to him about it before you get there, say mommy is going to take you to school, we are going to go in, mommy is going to give you hugs and kisses and then mommy is going to let you play and I will come right back. Also make up a routine at drop off, something you do every time so there is consistency for him. Two hugs, a kiss on the nose, another hug...something special, and let him add a few things in so he feels in control too.|`|jjeYCrYzaa	Before you go make sure he is busy, playing with one of his friends etc. So that he doesn't realise you have gone and when he does he won't think anything of it because he has other things on his mind.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I find other kids, can be more helpful than adults.

SbBhTDtLaa	Don't use any of the deodorants, cause your baby may do nursing strike.  Even I had the same problems, I started using the deodorants, my baby started refusing the breast milk.  Try using the baby products.   Happy nursing.|`|52f324625365b28f39a1f5b883fa4788aa	Hi,    I didn't think much of this but now that you mention it, I remember always sweating in the first few weeks of baby, when we were home from the hospital and rushing round bla bla bla. I put it down to rushing around.  It's better now that we've settled down.    In answer to your question, I think you can try any anti persperant for sensetive skin or one that is unscented so this should not affect the baby.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	It is totally safe to wear antiperspirant/deodorant while breastfeeding.  They are applied topically and do not get into your breastmilk.  Please for the sake of those around you do not rely on cornstarch...  that is just silly.  lmao...      Just use any type of antiperpirant/deodorant designed for someone who has excessive sweating.      And yes, it should be temporary until your hormones calm down. :)|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	It's a perfectly normal post-pregnancy occurrence...it happens to all women, even those who do not breast-feed.  That being said, you are probably going to have it longer than non-breast-feeding moms, but your baby is so lucky you are giving him/her the best start in life possible.    I would stay away from all commercial deodorants, and use some baby powder, or talcum powder.  Even cornstarch works well.  You really don't want those chemicals in the deodorant near your little one, and they can be absorbed into the skin, and possibly excreted in your milk.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Sounds like hormones. I used to sweat excessively before I had kids, but my hormones changed and after 2 kids I no longer have that problem-Every woman has different body chemistry.    I was once prescribed an antiperspirant for excessive underarm sweating. It was a liquid, and the bottle had a sponge tip applicator. I remember it smelled awful-A strong alcohol scent. Ask your DR about it.
215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Typically lines are their specialty and of course, scribbles. My 16 month old can draw lines and scribbles. My nearly 3 year old has a very big interest in drawing and you can start to see things that actually look like what she explains her drawing is. This morning she drew our dog, it was a triangular shape attached to a semi-circle and had legs. The more they draw the more practice they get and the more advanced their drawings become. She drew me a Christmas tree at Christmas time that was the right shape and color, I was amazed!|`|eULXQzXFaa	most kids at that age scribble but to encourage drawing get him/her to start drawing circles, squares, triangles etc..... shapes are the easiest ways to gets kids to be creative at that young of an age.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	A typical two year old can imitate a horizontal and vertical stroke, and make a circular motion though the ends of the circle don't have to meet.  It's fine motor skills.|`|f4Q3PeE0aa	fine motor skills|`|Ljues4IHaa	Hm my parents used to draw little stickmans and ask me to draw the eyes.. I apparently felt very proud :)|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	mostly just back and forth scribbles and circles|`|ncpl2ruzaa	usually all they are able to draw is scribbles, maybe try showing them how to draw different shapes? Or like someone said above drawing stick people. If your worried about your childs drawing skills why not get a coloring book and start off that way. but i believe it would be fine motor skills
Ez1eFeZ2aa	Hi, and congrats.  I am 36 weeks along and my stomach never got completely hard.  It is different for everyone.  You may notice a difference because the baby has descended into the birth canal.  If you are worried, you should call your doctor or local hospital and ask if that is an odd thing to happen.  Good luck and hope this helps.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi sounds like your baby is getting ready to come soon. you may have some fat its normal most woman do and its hard to get rid of it. your baby is probably engaged just look at your bump and if you notice its lower than iit was then your baby had engaged. good luck.|`|l79QIWszaa	Congratulations!  Woohoo you are almost there!      Your body changes so much during pregnancy and so much AFTER pregnancy, don't even start worrying about this now.  There's no way to tell for sure what the "fat" you talk of will look like in a couple weeks.  And, it's probably not fat, but fluid that is and has been protecting your baby.    Sounds like it is moving into the birth canal (called "dropping") and that is why things are changing.  Have you been feeling more pressure on your bottom then before?  That's how I could tell my baby dropped and my feet swelled up like balloons.    Hope this helps.  Good luck!|`|mCWy2VBGaa	Congratulations!  I'll tell you what my OB told me back when I was pregnant with my son (who will be 9 in March).  If you have a normal weight gain with pregnancy, it will seem "flabby", especially the closer to term you get.  If you felt the baby's head (hard) as being down and the bottom (softer) as being up, and now the hard part is less prominent but the baby hasn't undergone version, the head has most likely entered the birth canal, so the "flabby" feeling part will be a little more noticeable.  And don't worry.  There are ways to deal with baby fat - after your precious one is born.  For now, just be happy and love.  The other will resolve when the time comes.
JvZY0ZS4aa	Considering your situation and the fact that she's a good friend...    Paying her what you can afford, based on how much you usually pay her, is a good idea. However, more than that I think what would really touch her is a special gift and expression of how much you appreciate her.    She knows your situation, it's a pleasure for her to watch your daughter and you're friends. I'm sure she'd never turn down having some pay for her efforts, but I'm sure she understand how difficult your situation is right now and does not expect it. She certainly doesn't want to feel like she's been taken for granted though or 'used'.    I'd say the most important thing is to make her feel appreciated and to express to her how much her help has meant to you in such a tough time. A special gift basket with a heartfelt letter could do the trick. Or when you pay her, add a lovely bunch of flowers and a note to it.    I hope you and baby recover quickly!|`|AA11210211	Pay her what you can maybe?? OR if she isn't to worried about the money maybe make her a little basket that has some things in it that she likes,I watched my friends son when he was an infant for her and told her not to worry about paying me because she was strapped for cash and she would make me these little baskets that had lotions and soaps and stuff in them,I enjoyed the basket of goodies more than I did the money!! lol|`|44OH7Si6aa	Pay her for the diapers and tack on any amount she has spent on the child for food etc ( you don't say how old she is) then figure out how much the two of you can afford for her. Since she is keeping her while you are hospitalized I seriously doubt she expects payment. Personally, if I were the friend I would probably refuse the payment anyway. Give her the amount to cover her expenses while she kept the child and get her a gift to show that you appreciate your friend for doing this for you.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	give her 50 bucks|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	$15 per day and pay what you can until it is paid off.|`|m1RTNmqsaa	Id offer to give her something. If you cant don't the money, what about gift cards or little gift sets? Just a suggestion.    I hope you get to feeling better & get out of the hospital soon.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I would say pay her for the diapers like you said.    And get her a gift card for a grocery store maybe?        Or you can get a gift card...like $50 for apple bees or one of her favorite restaurants and offer to watch her kids for the night ( if she has any ) and let her go out and enjoy some dinner.|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	Ask her. Coming from a professional nanny, especially if you are good friends, she will work with you when you are in a hardship. She would probably accept something a lot smaller if you sit down and explain to her, might even work out a plan that best suits both of you. :)|`|vJEatJFPaa	Explain your situation first and go from there..Does she have kids? Me and my good friend don't pay each other but we swap watching each others little gals while we both attend classes...Is there any other favors you can help her out with?    I would definitely pay the $ for the diapers and snacks, maybe she really doesn't really care about the $...I know my best girlfriends tell me to forget it when i offer them $ for watching Livi....|`|EHY3FnAmaa	It sounds to me like she would not be expecting any money, so anything you give her I am sure would be fine. I would say like 60$ or even whatever you could afford at the moment|`|siDcjgJCaa	I would give her a gift card to her favorite restaurant or a spa or a gift basket. Maybe not cash... but a small thank you gift.|`|qStmw7qgaa	Your friend sounds amazing.  Were it me, and if I could afford it, I would send her on a mini vacation.  But I think that the 15 an hour is very reasonable.  Or maybe get her a gift.  Something that you know she has wanted for a really long time or something like that.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I would still pay her $15 a day. just explain the financial situation and she may tell you not to worry about it. At least explain you can only pay a certain amount each week.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	If $15 per day is what you agreed on or became accustomed to, I would continue that. Considering daycare for a toddler (where I live) costs about $250 per week, you are getting a great deal! I would explain to her how grateful you are and how much you appreciate her and what she is doing for you. Let her know you are keeping track of her "bill" and wil pay her "X" amount every week until you are paid in full. She will probably say "oh dont worry about it, dont pay me at all, etc" but you should anyway. Even though you love something doesnt mean it's not work! Good luck!|`|DBeZquWfaa	i would pay her around 30 dollars thats money for food,dipers and if she takes emma out on an outing maybe 5 dollars extra?|`|LMUwz5y8aa	5 box per hour!!!|`|17MZkNpZaa	yes you need to pay her something. if you cant afford much then let her know that. but anytime you get a little bit of something you need to put something to the side for your babysitter. your appreciation for doing such a great job with your child needs to be shown. even if all you have is food stamps fill her refrigerator up with food if you dint have cash. the last thing you want is for her to start feeling like you are taking advantage of her. that will cause a problem in your friendship and you probably wont have a sitter for too long.|`|nTuFIKUAaa	I would offer her a fair amount, say $10.00/day? she may decline, or accept you never know, but it's the appropriate thing to do.   Or perhaps you could offer her something besides money, like something she often asks you to do for her to help out instead. A day to herself every once in awhile, or taking her to do a day of running?   that's what friends are there for - to help eachother out. be lucky you have such a good one.|`|BTyCNexsaa	well it sounds like you are doing all you can right now. when your husband goes back to work let her know you will up the pay to 20 or 25 a day. the lowest i paid a babysitter for my son was 75 a week and i had to provid the dipers and wipes. if yall are really good friends then she wont expect to much from you since she prolly nows what you are going through. my best friend just had her 3rd child and i kept her son (8) and her other daughter (5) for 2 days. she only gave me a 15 walmart card but i didnt even want to accept that. i know how it is and friends need to be there for one another. who knows she will prolly need you just as must as you need her sooner or later.
uDOVf2vvaa	It will help but only for a short time. Good luck|`|mZjdxuweaa	MILK WILL HELP BUT ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME... TUMS REALLY WORK THE BEST I ATE THEM ALL THE TIME DUE TO HEART BURN!|`|dd63e8475e881a3f45f29502b473e0e8aa	milk will only help for a few mins. i took tums to help it. it wont help with the sweating.|`|Jswomud7aa	I had heartburn even when I drank milk... even when I drank water! I had wicked heart burn with my last pregnancy. The only thing that helped me was Mylanta. I kept the whole dang bottle in the refrigerator so it would be nice and chilled when I needed it too.     I couldn't even tell you how many times I got up to go to the fridge to get some Mylanta in the middle of the night!    My doctor is the one who recommended Mylanta. She said as long as you stay within the recommended dosage it's fine while pregnant.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I take TUMS and i also drink milk. Milk is only a temporary fix and will not last long. TUMS are safe to take during pregnancy, Just don't eat them like candy.|`|l6QPKcoLaa	Yes milk does help calm the heartburn it worked for my best friend and she had heartburn half of her pregnancy. That just means your baby is going to have alot of hair when she is born. Congradulations hope everything goes well bye!!|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Milk will help but doesnt last. I always took TUMS they are safe and they work not only for the min. but through out the day. I do however have to take TUMS sometimes  4 to 6 times aday and then somedays once all depends.. Crackers can also help to|`|joPJtKemaa	Milk might help but it can worsen the heartburn too.    It works different on everyone.    Milk made my heartburn worse and Tums did not help a bit, so I had to go on a prescription drug.    But try milk and Tums and see if it works for you.
LKIhUMCgaa	u can have light/mild cramping, they usually last for the entire 1st trimester, 2nd trimester they come and go, but not as often as in 1st trimester. i had my cramps every day for the first 12 weeks, second trimester i got it bout once a week or so.    so as long as they're not sever and u're not bleeding, u're fine.|`|AA11064598	I am 10 weeks pregnant and I have been experiencing little "cramps" here and there but I think its just my uterus stretching and everything moving around. Call your gyno whenever you are concerned they don't mind answering your questions and are very used to it! Congrats and wishing you a happy and healthy baby!|`|VMASMHX6aa	As long as it's not painful as such, then you don't need to worry. Pregnancy is full of little 'aches and pains' but things shouldn't really hurt. Period type pains are normal.|`|q6iDNUlmaa	Cramps in stomach is due to round ligament. The hormones make your stomach soft so that it can stretch to make room. It goes in about 8-10 weeks and returns in 16weeks and remains for another a week. Just dont put pressure on your tummy - dont lift weights, dont bend to lift object, dont raise your arm with heavy weight. As long as you take care of these things, it should not bother you.    Cramps in legs are due to Calcium deficiency. Ask your doc about calcium, iron and vit supplements. Cramps in legs during early pregnancy are very mild and usually go away by 7-8 weeks. Then they return severly in third trimester if you have not been taking the supplements regularly.|`|ApyrV5J9aa	I am 8 weeks and I had cramping on and off starting at about 8 dpo and lasting for 2-3 weeks. They weren't quite as bad as period cramps, but almost. We tried for a really long time so it freaked me out but everything I read, and what my doctor says, is that it's normal. If the pain is REALLY bad or if there is bleeding with it, that's when you should be concerned and call a doctor. Also, I'm not sure how far you are now, but you may have a little spotting. I had always heard of implantation bleeding but figured it happened at the time of implantation, not after you got a positive pregnancy test. I had some spotting at 14dpo and along with the cramping I was scared but my doctor assured me that it was nothing to worry about and just implantation bleeding. Now I've seen the baby and heard the heartbeat so it's all good! :) best of luck to you!|`|Y0t4bXsHaa	i am around 6  weeks pregnant. i get these cramps. also a strange stretchy feelings which the doc says are ligaments stretching. so i would not worry about it as long as you dont bleed. best of luck
UUpsa35Daa	Personally...i don't think  she should have a boyfriend at that age, nor be left alone with a boy at that age.    But, i think them being supervised friends is okay. Let him come over, only when you're around. Get to know him, watch them...then judge whether or not he should be staying around. And it's time to have a talk with her about relationships and guys and being intimate and what can come from being intimate.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	first of all, you need to learn how to spell.  If you don't know how to handle your 12 year old daughter now, you'll be able to at 17|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Tell the boy to get lost and have a serious talk with your daughter about pregnancy, appropriate behavior and growing up.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	I wasn't allowed to have boyfriends until I was 15.  He's only 15, don't worry too much, but tell her you don't want her with him because there's something abnormal about a 15 year old with a 12 year old.  Their maturity isn't compatible yet.  If she tells you do back off, then do so.  She'll be aware of the problem and use it as an excuse to break up with him later.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	shes 12, she doesnt need to be dating, she can have her little boyfriend at school and whatnot, but you dont need to be letting them go to each others houses and go out on dates and such yet. she is way too young.|`|oOqSpBmbaa	That guy is kinda perverted... :/ Don't be too in her face about it though... I can't get over that guy wantin a 12 year old, I can understand her wantin an older guy... But :S|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	let her have her freedom but give her rules and definitly talk to her about protected sex.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I doubt you are the mother of a 12 year old by the way you wrote that...12 year olds shouldn't date. 15/16 is a good age to start dating.|`|mxrlZEweaa	Tell her you don't want her to see him anymore. A 15 year old boy should not be interested in a 12 year old girl. And make sure he isn't invited to her polka dot party!|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	talk to her about being safe, you really cant stop her from seeing him, if you try she will sneak around, and unfortunately these days, it seems like every teenager is having sex, and there isnt much we can do about it but teach our children how to be safe and show them the consequences if they dont, talk to them about AIDS, it would be even better if  you could find someone with the disease to talk to her, talk to her about having babies and how it will change her life if that were to happen, and tell her all the ways abstaining from sex would benefit her. talk to her like you understand, not just like a parent, its in a teenagers nature to rebell against someone who tells them what to do because they want to make their own decisions, so dont make it come out as if you're telling her what to do.|`|ILZY7BD0aa	you're the boss. He would be out of her life.  She's too young to have a boyfriend.  Stop shopping and start setting rules and regulations.|`|U4MyeZd2aa	I seriously doubt that a 15 yr. old really likes a 12 yr. old. tell him to GET LOST!! try to tell your daughter the reasons behind your actions as well|`|r07BwhO1aa	Troll!

Second, talk to the kid, if he's got sexual intents beat him with a baseball bat until he hasn't got anymore. Oooor you could also tell him to leave your little baby girl alone, of course.    Third, it's NOT NORMAL for little kids to have boyfriends and girlfriends an the entire circus. No feromones, no hormones -> No being in love.|`|QiEKKXOHaa	thats just pervy of the boy?!

hWc65sEtaa	Sometimes the body miscarries if there is something wrong with the baby.  You don't do anything wrong, but the baby might not have been developing properly.|`|tbZNMfAsaa	Basically if something didn't happen right from conception on your body trashes the pregnancy. There might have been something wrong with the way it attached to the lining or perhaps even the cell structure of the egg. Anyway, it's nothing to worry about. Your body is just doing it's job. Try again.    The thing is, there is no way to save an miscarriage from happening. And even if there were - why would you want to? There is a reason your body got rid of it, your body is smarter than you think.|`|mxixfE3Raa	It just happens. Nothing can prevent it.|`|H74F8jxuaa	Miscarriages are often caused by nothing other than the egg did implant correctly, the egg did develop properly, you had a chemical pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy.  You most likely didn't do anything wrong, there was just a problem with the egg.  I miscarried at 7 weeks and the reason was because the egg didn't develop right.  It was a blessing because no telling what could have gone wrong later on in the pregnancy.  Don't worry and keep trying.  It will happen!|`|i8Ch743Laa	It means that something with the mother and father's cells just didn't work out. I had something along these lines,but I carried until 20 weeks,so it was more just that something was wrong/up with my body. The doctor explained to me it means that your body realizes something isn't right with how the cells connected.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Maybe the egg didn't attach well to the wall of your uterus. 1 in 4 pregnancies fail for some reason or another.  I had 2 miscarriages before I became pregnant with my current child. Now I'm entering my 3rd trimester in a few weeks. These things happen. It doesn't mean that you'll never have kids again. You have given birth and experienced the miracle of child birth before. Good luck.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Thats why miscarriages usually happen early on is because there was something wrong with the baby genetically from conception. It doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with you and your husband. Miscarriages are pretty common. They happen to 1 in 5 women statistically all the time. Chances are your next pregnancy will be fine and you won't miscarry.|`|NiOjHyfKaa	its not whether or not yu can have kids. it could have been a bunch of reasons. one being that there was something wrong with the baby and your body detected it and miscarried.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	It's just that there was a problem with the DNA and chromosomes from the beginning.  The fact that you have kids already does not decrease your odds for having a miscarriage.  My doctor said one in three pregnancies will result in miscarriage, and the majority of those are just that things just didn't work out well in the very early stages.  A lot of things happen when the sperm meets the egg and there are so many things that can go wrong that you can't prevent.  This doesn't mean you will miscarry again, but there is always the chance.  I'm sorry for your loss and good luck in the future!|`|1whTwTbDaa	Sometimes the sperm meets the egg at the wrong time, too soon or too late, and it gets messed up. Any other times, either the egg or the sperm is missing one or more of the necessary chromosomes to create a healthy baby. What you must realize is that your body is designed to notice this mishap and dispose of the blastocyst before it has a chance of becoming a child that would not have a normal life, and in the long run, it is making sure you don't suffer the pain of having to raise a child of special needs or have to bury your child early in life. I know it is unfair and it doesn't make since, at least not right now...but just be thankful your body is not defective and it can dispose of the ones that are not right. You will have a healthy baby soon...this type of thing only happens once or twice in a lifetime. Now if it happens anymore than that then you should have genetic counseling...but I think this was just an isolated incident. Good luck in the future hun, I know how hard it is, I lost one at 12 weeks from the same thing, and I have 4 other kids. Now I have got another on the way, due in June and everything is just fine! So no worries!|`|5dc42b275b638aa5e6b0b8b56bcb0c75aa	I'm sorry that you are dealing with this.    Sometimes it just happens.  For what ever reason this pregnancy just did not take hold.  It does not mean that all of your pregnancy won't work out.  The baby was not viable, so your body took care of it.      My friend had two miscarriages before having her little boy.  Its impossible to tell why, but have faith that all will work out in the end.
F8iYNurEaa	I miscarriaged last week at 5 weeks so I know how upsetting it is. I kept thinking that there must be something wrong with my eggs or partners sperm but this is not the case as I found out when I spoke to the nurse at the hospital.    The doctor didn't mean that you and your partner aren't healthy or incapable of having healthy kids. He meant that the embryo either didn't implant properly meaning that you would have not have had a healthy/successful pregnancy had it gone further down the line, or it could be that the cells of the embryo weren't developing properly which means that the baby wouldn't develop normally or at all. Your body was rejecting this "abnormality" so that you could try again for a healthy baby.|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	Miscarriages happens with up to 30% of all recognized pregnancies.  I had one at 5 1/2 weeks pregnant in December.   All sorts of things can happen in the inplantation and formation of the embryo.   Probably half of of all miscarriages involve chromosome problems in the baby, and basically the baby wasn't compatible with life, and this is nature's way of ending it early.  I got this  information from my perinatologist.         Most likely you and your hubby will be able to have  a baby together in the future.|`|3MDY29gnaa	miscarriages happen hun! and i am so sorry for your lost. We really don't know why is wasnt a healthy pregnancy, thats something you would have to ask your doctor!  Just because your abke to have kids doesnt mean it's a healthy pregnancy.|`|mbGOEZSAaa	I also lost one at about 5 weeks. I also have 2 completely healthy girls that I had no problems carrying. Some books say that sometimes your body can tell if the baby has problems or is going to have some defect and may just end the pregnancy itself. Maybe the baby just wasn't developing correctly. Sorry about your loss.|`|304ef3a00356e988a8cd661bcf96f680aa	I'm sorry to hear about your miscarriage. I know how you feel, all too well. When you have a healthy pregnancy, your numbers (from your blood test) should double every 42-74 hours. Sometimes a baby won't develop or develop as quickly then others. Another reason is for a chromosome disorder (which is the most common cause for a miscarriage). It happens one every four pregnancies. The only real reason as to why you had the miscarriage is that only God knows the answer, but know that you are not alone. I hope and pray that you will get your baby in God's timing!!
mgLb5Yohaa	Don't worry, you can't overfeed a newborn! Listen to your doctor, not all babies are by the textbook. Feed her when she's hungry, milk doesn't stay in their stomachs but so long, so about every 2-3 hours. I also asked my Pediatrician how many oz's per day, she told me to fill a bottle  to 4 oz, (or breast feed 15 mins on each side), and if he completes it and appears satisfied, then you know that's enough. A baby can feed 8-12 times a day, and ounces can vary by 1-2, depending on the baby. Up the baby's ounces if you feel he/she doesn't appear to be satisfied, or appears hungry less than 2 hours.     Go with your instinct as a mother, and continue to partner with your Pediatrician. I love the parenting magazines, too, but when they begin categorizing your baby by the textbook, I've learned to ignore it! As long as your baby is gaining weight, and appears to be satisfied after her meal, don't stress on it!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	At this age, feed her when she's hungry.  Your doctor will let you know if there's any reason you need to step back.  Just don't make her finish a bottle if she indicates that she's done.  Toss it.    Also, the amount they want starts to vary.  My son has gone through periods where he ate at ton a day, and other periods where he wasn't that interested.|`|zwctZ812aa	Just feed her when she's hungry.  Your doctor is going to know her situation better than the magazine.  I was told to multiply your baby's weight by 2.5, and that's how many ounces of milk your baby should be getting a day.  So if she is 10 pounds, that's 25 ounces total.  That being said, my son always needed more than that to be satisfied.  I told my doctor how much we were feeding him and that I was worried it was too much (he was drinking about 3 oz every 2 hours at that age when we bottle fed him) so that was like 36 ounces, but he was about 12 pounds.  So I was worried I was feeding him 6 ounces too much, but the doctor said no, he was growing great and to keep giving him what he wanted.  Your doctor will tell you at her next appointment if he thinks she is gaining weight too quickly.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	As much as she will take.  Babies are very good at knowing when they are full.  Listen to your doctor.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	i'd say like 24 oz or somehting.. mine would eat 2oz every hr and half or every 2 hours.... i thought i was too because she was always hungry but yeah just feed her when she's hungry i did and my baby is fine|`|OrKpKxkHaa	The rule of thumb is 2-3 ounces per pound that your baby weighs up to a maximum of 32 ounces. That would be split up about every 2-4 hours. Shes probably drinking 4 ounce bottles right now. I would feed her whenever she is hungry. My 3 month old drinks 6 ounces every 3 -3 1/2 hours 3x per day and nurses two or three times per day. Good luck!|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	my 6 week old son currently takes 4 1/2 ounces every 3 1/2 -4 hours.  sometimes if hes sleeping he will go 5-6 hours without a bottle, thats rare though lol..  dont listen to magazines feed your little one on demand, she will only take what she needs.|`|d5707a466bbd84ff9d6588fbd5cda26aaa	i dont think you can over feed her. id listen to your doctor instead of the magazines. my son used to eat a lot when he was 2-3 months. hes almost 5 now and has slowed down alot! his doctor told me some babies gain a lot of weight the first few months then slow down as they hit 5-6 months. good luck!|`|C0GeEv7kaa	You should never limit how much your infant is eating. Their little bodies are working so hard to grow right now that they need all of the calories they can get. Now is not the time for you to be worried about your child gaining weight.|`|qStmw7qgaa	At 6 weeks we were giving our baby 2 ozs. every two hours.  It worked perfectly, and that is when she started sleeping 6 to 7 hours straight at night.  Give that a try.  She will let you know if she wants more...like screaming about 10 min. after you take it away from her.  Means one of two things usually.  She is still hungry, or she needs to burp.  But yeah, that is what our dr. told us to do, and it has been great.  Now she is 9 weeks, and she is doing 3 ozs every 2-1/2 to 3 hours and sleeping (as of this morning) 11 hours straight through the night.    Good Luck.|`|uN1zCMmjaa	just let her eat. my son eats alot too. :)|`|SONLm2Ilaa	If she is breastfeeding than she can eat as much as she wants! Screw your parenting magazines, you can throw those in the trash! A newborn needs to eat and sleep on demand, you can't control that! They go through spurt where they will eat a lot and spurts where they will eat less... Give her what she needs when she needs it! My 8 week old is 13 pounds and dr is very impressed because she is so big and healthy! She said to let them get as chubby as they want on breastmilk! Don't question your drs advice, they ovbiously know what they're talking about!|`|5Crovdoaaa	You CANNOT overfeed a newborn!!! Let her eat how much she wants, whenever she wants. And Parenting magazine is crap. Someone gave me a FREE 2 year subscription and I STILL canceled it because the advice they give in it so watered down and ambiguous. Don't waste your money.
9x9WPoNHaa	Did you have another test done? If you've had elevated temperatures for 35 days a pregnancy test should come back positive by now. Honestly without looking at your chart, that's about all I can tell you. Good luck.|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    The light bleed you described sounds like it may of been implantation bleeding, 1 in 3 woman experience this, its when the egg attaches to the lining of the uterus.  In my first pregnancy it took me 5 weeks to get a BFP my doctor said my body took a little while longer to produce high HCG levels.  So maybe this is whats happening.    The blood test tomorrow is the best bet for you as they are more accurate and detect low levels that a home test cant.  You signs sound good though, i had nausea and sore boobs early on.    Best of luck xxxxx

And what a beautiful story you will be able to tell her from our Father's word! This is my favorite! God bless!|`|8ff1197fcf334cda2870e53b90edf1dbaa	I like  Willow  Lydia and  Samantha|`|ZvFamJM8aa	i like Autumn  Willow    and my idea Carrisa|`|224HLZXdaa	My name is on this list..Samantha, and I enjoy the different nicknames associated w it. My dads side calls me Sam, my moms calls me Sammy, Im Samantha at school. Its pretty versatile :)|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	Autumn, Willow, and Samantha are my favs!|`|2f4Nvp79aa	if i were u i would go with joy its not common with others and it is very unique|`|n6cuO8joaa	my daughters name is shayne elizabeth i love that name i like different name = )|`|UCkkrhdhaa	my favorite individual name is Elizabeth. favorite combo is Abigail Joy.|`|ORa2ZNAlaa	I really like Autumn!|`|vw7ebwgnaa	I like Jane for a middle name. I like Emily, Isabel, Abigail, and Laura for first names. Just as FYI...Samantha is INCREDIBLY common (That's my name and I have at least one double in every single one of my classes....my last class of 60 there were SEVEN of us!! I don't like it...).|`|do3Sisb3aa	Hii..  I like Ruth - it means "A Companion" and its a Hebrew  name.    If you name ur baby "Elizabeth" give her the nickname "Liz" somehow sounds lovely to me    Good luck!|`|qBl07nnUaa	Favorites:  Emma                  Emily &                  Rebecca|`|rNNvAcq4aa	Isabel :]    i also like the name dianabell|`|7d632fbyaa	RUTH , NAME FROM THE BIBLE|`|KHic5rAaaa	Unless you're a celebrity and your kid will automatically grow up to be cool, don't give your child really strange or stupid names like Willow, Joy, and Autumn.  Save the strange names for your child's middle name.  My middle name (Laracy) is my great-great grandmother's maiden name.  I love it because it's meaningful and unique.  It's strange as anything, but I don't mind because it's not my first name!    Besides those names, your list is great!  I'm a huge fan of classic names; however, Esther and Ruth (unless Ruthie) are too outdated.  I absolutely love simple and short names that aren't too common like Jane or Janey.    Samantha is cute as well.  Susan, Laura and Emily; however, are too common.  Nevertheless, I still love the name Emily.  I would check whether it's been a popular name recently.  And Emma is becoming increasingly more popular, too You don't want your kid to be in a class with 5 others Emma's!    My top favorites are Jane and Lizzy (very cute),|`|UXCMonnDaa	i love Emma but i would use Emelia because with that name you can use all these nicknames: Emma, Emme, Em, Melia, Lia, Eli (or spelt Ellie)    all really cute.    i also love Abby a lot! but i think Abigail is to common, so i like Abiella, Abrielle, Abriella which Abi can also be short for.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Annabelle or Emma    Autumn is also beautiful  I like Annabelle Grace & Emma Leigh.
GGH0HVdvaa	Eh, it's not a big deal. You aren't actually related to her so its not uncommon or disgusting or anything. No need to leave home, but you might want to try to forget your feelings before they cause trouble.|`|H2IqzG12aa	If the temptation is too great (and apparently she's not helping matters any), and your parents don't know how to deal with the situation, you might best go live with friends or other relatives for a while.  It's not the end of the world if something happens, but it's better to not let anything happen.    This probably happens between step siblings more often than anyone will admit.  Of course, your parents getting married didn't really make you two brother and sister, so your feelings are normal.  Some parents understand this, but too many don't.    Good luck.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Kids your age, first learning about sexuality in general, often have those kinds of thoughts.  Don't stress about them.  They'll go away.    She will grow out of the showing off stage she's going through.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	What do you mean specifically you "fancy" and how old are you?|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You shouldn't leave home.  But, She shouldn't be dressing provocatively.|`|VDubl7Dfaa	Well, its not BAD. You arent related, so its not like your going to be inbred or something if you got together. Well, since shes 13, i would hope your not over 18 because thats kind of weird. Some people may think your perverted because you like your sister, but i dont think you are because you arent related in any way (I HOPE.) No you shouldnt run away from home. It probably would be a big mistake; just doing that because you fancy your stepsister who you arent even related to.        Hope this helped! : )|`|oP8krEBiaa	first of all. how old are you?  second of all. no dont leave home?  third of all. youre a troll....|`|2Lv37jg1aa	I have been staying home alone since I was 9.|`|43769776f4128a4bec47a0e8a7748039aa	Your question is not very specific. And need to be more explaining. And how old are you?? Need to continue with school so you can be moe specific in your questions you ask.|`|8chxrFFQaa	No. Just try to stop thinking about her and it will go away. You're not related, so it's not that bad.|`|mxrlZEweaa	You have a crush on your stepsister? How old are you? If you are legally an adult you cannot do anything about your feelings. Maybe you should leave home. If you are not overage it's perfectly normal to start liking someone you live with. She's not related to you so there's nothing wrong with it. Just don't do anything about it. Try finding someone new to "fancy".|`|onMxrIzHaa	wat r u toking about "fancy" u envy her?? no u should not leave home... wait how old r u??|`|XXw7DUDRaa	dont worry i fancy my 13 year old step brother  hes  a total babe|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Since you guys are not blood related its okay to feel this way but i dnt think you should try & follow it up.   Yuh guys are bonded by the law [marriage] so jst concentrate on more important stuff & no dont leave home.  oh yeh & how old r yuh?

You should NOT have unprotected sex if you dont want to get pregnant - end of!|`|smsUZG4Iaa	just take into consideration that sperm can live for up to 5 days and you ovulate around the 14th day with a normal cycle counting the first day of your period as day 1..I dont believe you can get pregnant that soon after your period but you never know anything can happen.. Best of Luck|`|BrUJuogGaa	what  shale  i do?|`|shKc7lZcaa	My 4 yr old is proof - sex the last day of my period :)
8s4VypoXaa	It sound like that to me i had excatly the same on day 14 of my cycle so i hope so. But i dont do the ovulation tests as not always accurate. I do know however you are not suppose to take them in the morning as there is less lh hormone in urine that early in the morning so you should take it after two. I dont know but if you took the test in the morning that may of been why it was not a stong line. good luck and lots of baby dust

AA12349214	Mine was 5th months old when I first took her to a group.  It was nerve wracking!  They even started moaning because my daughter wanted a cuddle from me now and again and their babies didnt do that!  Then one of the mums said 'you dress a bit smart dont you?'  - I was clean and tidy and had a skirt and top on but not over the top - so that made me feel even more uncomfortable!  Then the next week we were asked to bring something along for the mums to have with a cuppa and I took something home made which nearly made them freak.  However, after a few weeks it all got easier and I wondered if perhaps I hadnt imagined the sleights .  In the end I just kept going for the sake of my daughter, and later my son, and it was all okay.  What it did make me do however was be blooming nice to any new mum that came!  Keep going, it all works out in the end.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	sorry a bit confused here...|`|hcRGqk2gaa	It seems some people know what you're talking about but I don't. Taking her where? A seminar group, or something? You have to be more descriptive.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Take my child WHERE???|`|9dJpJBygaa	no one knows what you are talking about bc you say "taking" when your soppose to say "taking to the park" or something. you have to put the place! do u speak english?|`|wzGSdBHsaa	I took my little boy when he was about 4 months so i could get used to going myself. I also new one of the mums already so yhat made it easier.|`|4oCADms6aa	At what age did I first take my child WHERE?|`|SUR1MHqWaa	5 months is good I took my eldest child when he was 7 months and my daughter came with me from 2 weeks old. Both my children have formed good friendships in these groups which has continued into preschool. Don't worry about the non chatty mums let them get on with it and you enjoy your daughters new experience - and some adult chat from the nicer mums.|`|I6w6Nrphaa	whar age did we take them WHERE???|`|P25GuvNjaa	Hi, we have never been to mothers and toddlers sorry!  Just had to ask if so happy was illiterate or something?  Your question makes perfect sense!    I would immagine it would be nerve racking!  I wish I had gone now though as I would have liked to have met more mums!    When did you take your child to mother and toddlers!?  Its not that difficult!|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	Take your child where?|`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	I first took my daughter when she was 1 years old.  I was a late starter as I had to move twice in 6 months and never settled into taking her.    We has great fun. She still goes to the same one now and she is nearly 3 years old. In april she will start for 2 afternoons a week at playschool.    They also offer trips at my toddler group. Before christmas we went to a farm, where there was also an indoor soft play area etc. It was great fun    I am starting a free course in February. It is helping parents learn to cook healthily On a budget. They also offer a free creche as well.    Well worth going and I have made a couple of really good friends as well|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Am I the only confused person here?|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	more info      tinkerbell, the question makes no sense, you are GUESSING, it never states WHERE the person is talking about ,and i tihnk its rather rude to be calling people illiterate when the question is plainly missing the most important bit of information.
bYReZfbRaa	i know its weird but that happens to me and i am 20 wks on sunday!  trust me enjoy not being big now!! i know its exciteing to have a belly but u get so achey when it comes!|`|65de15f23f2269f4a1cd8334a7b742f9aa	Enjoy it while it lasts!

I'm nearly 35 weeks and want it over now cos the back ache is so bad...|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Well i did not show till i was at least at 5 months pregnant with my first baby it was a lil lump then at 7 month i was huge lol...... I am now pregnant with my 3rd baby and i am 4 months and i am showing alot....|`|Yf9VZunaaa	I didn't show forever!  I'm 37weeks now and I think I looked pregnant at about 7 months or so.  Still looking at me now I don't look like my baby is due in 3 weeks!  It's true what they say, that every pregnancy really is different.  I remember being so depressed that no one could tell and now I wish things were the other way around!  Enjoy your anonymity for now!|`|IsnHXRo4aa	I didn't show til almost 6 months with both mine. I mean I had a lil belly but you couldn't tell I was PREGO I just looked chubby :P|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I didn't really start showing until I was a little over 5 months pregnant and not to mention I only gain like 23 pounds throughout my whole pregnancy. And my son was a healthy 8 pounds and 3 ounces. So don't you worry at least you won't be fat after you have your kid.lol|`|DNygQdmVaa	youre being impatient lol.    Just wait youll show soon enough.
UUpsa35Daa	The only way to know for sure if you're pregnant to take a pregnancy test. I'm willing to bet you're not, but better be safe than sorry. An over the counter test doesn't cost that much and takes all of 5 minutes. Small price to pay to know for sure.
654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Craving ice is a sign of iron deficiency...is your baby on vitamins or iron supplements?  She needs to have her blood checked to see if she is iron deficient...    This is something that is easy to fix with supplements, but if there is a medical reason her iron is low, it is critical to find out why.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	other then being a choking hazzard and rough on her teeth it wont hurt her, its just water.    "always honest"  maybe you should read the question and what it REALLY says instead of what you WANT it  to say.|`|FplTPoAyaa	I would definitely let the doctor know.  I have heard that eating (craving) ice is a sign of anemia.  Why not try giving her a popsicle instead ? Maybe that would satisfy her craving ?  Good luck.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	It can be bad for a person teeth.  I think it could indicate she is low on iron.  Ask her doctor next time you go in.    Could just be that she likes it.  I love to chew ice - QuikTrip crushed ice is the best.|`|I2e4LFF9aa	why would you just be feeding her icecream? Take a parenting class, you obviously dont know about kids.|`|15a395b81e70741dfdfed45167d39207aa	Check with the doctor. Call the nurse will be more than glade to help you.

She probably thinks it's interesting. I really wouldn't allow her to eat ice, but if you do let her, make sure it's not a big, sharp, piece of ice.|`|P2hhUsoMaa	My daughter did the same thing around 2. But I think it was because I was pregnant and I would eat ice alot.  She hasn't asked for any since I had my son and I'm not eating it.  I don't think it means anything.|`|caI6T1N9aa	Chewing ice is not good for the teeth. She is lacking a mineral if she is craving ice. Get her blood ran to see what she is low on in the mineral dept.    EDIT: I did some research on this.    2. Drinking Water as a Source of Essential Minerals  Some 21 mineral elements are known or suspected to be essential for humans. This number  includes four that function physiologically as anions or in anionic groupings {chlorine as Cl-,  phosphorus as PO4-3, molybdenum as MoO4-2, fluorine as F-}, eight that function in their simple cationic forms {calcium (Ca+2), magnesium (Mg+2), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+),  ferrous iron (Fe+2), copper (Cu+2), zinc (Zn+2), manganese (Mn+2) } and which are subject to  chelation by either intact proteins or a variety of small, organic molecules; ions of two nonmetals  {iodine (I) and selenium (Se)} that function as constituents of covalent compounds (e.g.,  iodothyronine, selenocysteine) that are formed metabolically; and ions from five additional  elements: boron (B), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), silicon (Si), vanadium (V)} the nutritional  significance of which remain to be fully elucidated. Thus, fourteen mineral elements are  established as being essential for good health; these elements in combined form affect bone and  membrane structure (Ca, P, Mg, F), water and electrolyte balance (Na, K, Cl), metabolic catalysis  (Zn, Cu, Se, Mg, Mn, Mo), oxygen binding (Fe), and hormone functions (I, Cr).  Health consequences of micronutrient deficiencies include increased morbidity, mortality  due to reduced immune defense systems and impaired physical and mental development.  Deficiencies of several mineral elements, particularly iron and iodine, are the basis of health  problems in many parts of the world. Nearly 40% of the worlds women are estimated to be  anemic due, to a great extent, to poorly bioavailable dietary iron. Low intakes of Ca, and perhaps  Mg, contribute to rickets in children and osteoporosis in women worldwide. Due to inadequate  diets, many children are deficient in Fe, Zn, and Cu and other micronutrients especially in  developing countries. One third of the world's children fail to reach their physical and mental  potentials and many are made vulnerable to infectious diseases that account for half of all child  deaths. Nearly 750 million people have goiter or my edematous cretinism due to iodine  deficiency, and almost 2 billion people have inadequate iodine nutrition. These nutritional  deficiencies decrease worker productivity and increase the rates of disease and death in adults.  Many result from diets that may also involve insufficient intakes of Cu, Cr and B. In developed  countries changing dietary patterns such as reduced milk consumption may predispose to  conditions like osteoporosis.  Drinking water supplies may contain some of these essential minerals naturally or  through deliberate or incidental addition. Water supplies are highly variable in their mineral  contents and, while some contribute appreciable amounts of certain minerals either due to natural  conditions (e.g., Ca, Mg, Se, F, Zn), intentional additions (F), or leaching from piping (Cu), most  provide lesser amounts of nutritionally - essential minerals. Many persons consume mineral  waters because of the perception that they may be more healthful.  The enteric absorption of minerals from drinking water is determined by several factors  including the intrinsic properties of particular chemical species that are present, physiological  conditions of the gut environment, and exogenous factors related to the meal/diet in which the  minerals are ingested. Accordingly, waterborne selenium (selenite, selenate) is passively  absorbed at somewhat lower efficiencies (60-80%) than the selenoaminoacids in foods (90-95%)  that are actively transported across the gut. The inorganic oxidized iron in water will be absorbed  at very low (  is also subject to age-related declines in efficiency (Cu, Zn), early post-natal lack of regulation  (Fe, Zn, Cr), adaptive increases in efficiency by receptor up-regulation during periods of  deficiency (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr), dependence on other co-present nutrients for metabolism (Se-I,  Cu-Fe), and to anabolic and catabolic effects on tissue sequestration (Zn, Se, Cr).  Minerals in water are subject to most of the same determinants of bioavailabilty that affect  the utilization of those minerals in foods.|`|zzqmbA19aa	There's nothing wrong with her.  She's just learning to use her teeth.  Both my boys did the same at her age.  The main thing you want to do is keep an eye on the size of the ice.  I gave my 2 year old crushed ice instead of cubes because the doctor said that he could choke on the big ice cubes when they melt and get smaller.    Just keep an eye on her, and if you are really worried, ask your doctor at her next visit.|`|u7h1XRh3aa	She's perfectly normal and she'll come to no harm from eating ice.  Just make sure it's clean!|`|HB38sMkfaa	edited    my daughter is 22 months and loves to eat ice.i only give her small pieces though. she just likes it.she sees me eat the ice from my drinks and wants some.if i never ate it she would never know.    it can mean there is something wrong but think about the other factors...does she want ice because you or someone in your house eats it?or is she really just craving it randomly? if you are seriously concerned call your pediatrician.    i would(edit:would not) be concerned shes probably just copying someone else.just make sure the pieces are small so she doesnt hurt her teeth.and dont give her too much so she doesnt get brain freeze.
Ka52nbhNaa	I am not aware of any free medication program from Fertility Lifelines - they do have a program called FertilityAssist2 which provides up to $500 discount if you pay for your cycle with cash and the first cycle does not work.  If you use the recommended pharmacy, they will give you up to $500 worth of meds for your 2nd cycle . . . but you are on your own for the first.     http://www.fertilitylifelines.com/paying...    I recommend that you call them - 1-866-LETS TRY - it is a free call and they are VERY nice and helpful.  There might be another program that is not listed on their site.  I contacted them for info and an insurance review when we went through IVF.    As to miscarriage rates, most studies do not find IVF to have higher rates of miscarriage . . . it is usually other factors such as PCOS, advanced maternal age etc . . . that force you to seek fertility treatments and these medical conditions can put you at higher risk.  But, if you are not going to become naturally, then you need to decide if it is worth trying . . . the miscarriage rate is significantly lower than the success rate of those who go on to have children.    After 5 failed IUI cycles and a male factor issue, I would definitely move onto IVF.  You can go to this site http://www.sart.org/find_frm.html to see more information on success rates for the clinic that you are working with.    We did IVF after 3 failed Clomid / Ovidrel and 3 failed injectibles (Gonal F and other meds) IUI cycles.  We were blessed on our first IVF try - our twins boy/girl are now 5 months old.    I know it is so tough - but you will get through this, do not lose faith and keep doing what you are doing - research and be educated on the whole thing.      Here is a great site for info on how to pay for your treatments:   http://www.nobabyonboard.com/options.htm...    Best wishes and baby dust!|`|wiyQ3m9Vaa	After 3 yrs of marriage and trying to conceive all of that time. My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IVF. Went through the IVF injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IVF and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is. God bless you and know that He is with you through all of this.    http://www.indianmedguru.com  You can get much information in this website.|`|304ef3a00356e988a8cd661bcf96f680aa	I have heard about Fertility Lifelines at my Fertility Clinic. I believe they have pamphlets about it. As for the free medications, I'm not sure, but you can check it out on their website.  I'm not quite sure about the rate of success or miscarriage for IVF patiences.   I have PCOS and seemed to be doing fine with Clomid and Ovdril. Have you taken any of these meds?
2QpCk8V8aa	giving hand jobs and 12?!  wow how stupid.    you can't be pregnant if you have not started your period.|`|wq3DZ3E0aa	If the male sperm was on her finger and then she pleasured herself with the sperm on her finger then "YES" it is very possible to get pregnant     Hope this helps !  :-)|`|HMhUKAgkaa	You can but there's like only a 5% chance that it will actually happen. If she is pregnant, it's most likely from intercourse, not what she described. She needs to take a pregnancy test but I doubt she's pregnant. She needs to be more responsible and use condoms and birth control before she does end up pregnant.|`|hWc65sEtaa	I doubt she got pregnant that way, but if she got sperm in her vagina there's a chance.  Have her take a test.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It would be technically possible to get pregnant that way, but the odds would be VERY remote.    And, in any case, 'a really bad tummyache' and inability to walk are NOT signs of early pregnancy.  If she's in that much pain, she needs to see her doctor.  She might have a pelvic infection, or appendicitis.|`|VdjmrwMZaa	im guessing your friend is about 16...  and is an attention seeker..  and that was her 1st time...|`|gwuTKiNXaa	yep it sure is possible|`|lNhUgQnuaa	Well that can happen It is possible even though it sound observe|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You cannot get pregnant this way.  You can get an STD that way.  Seems she has a different issue to worry about.|`|AA11985426	hahaha, you make me laugh :)  This is a joke right    Yes she could be pregnant, but its VERY unlikely.  More like she just feels ill and has some kind of infection.  Tell her to wash her hands next time !|`|tIldpr7vaa	why wouldnt u just wipe ur fingers off first?|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes she can get pregnant this way but its very highly unlikely.|`|IllWKAUGaa	it is possible, but almost unheard of....she's not pregnant, it's all in her head....if she hasn't ever had a period then she's not pregnant (although her first ovulation would happen before her first period...so she should be careful)...|`|e6Yd5vsNaa	if she hasnt even started her periods yet then she isnt realising eggs to get fertilised, this white stuff is discharge and the stomach ach if it was the truth will probably be her periods starting. tell your "FRIEND" to stop telling porkies.|`|LLvetbbpaa	you can get pregnant this way but its very hard to xD|`|QTxdNavKaa	Yes it is actually possible - unlikely though.|`|nq9ZSHXraa	Lol if you directly put live sperm inside you then you can become pregnant|`|zWX5GDehaa	I'm pretty sure you can get pregnant but I don't think that there would be enough.|`|tE2ZHOd6aa	if the sperm went inside her then maybe but i doubt she is pregnant, sounds like an atention seeker to me|`|A1NskFUzaa	yeah its possible, I'd go to a doctor a-sap, get her checked out.|`|M8fQiTsqaa	hmmm. i gess if sperm gets inside her vagina thn there is a chance that she is pregnant, get a test dun to mke sure|`|3yYozfpjaa	HAHAHAHA that's the funniest thing i've ever heard.|`|LWl5iiBKaa	Her stomach might hurt because shes upset about maybe being pregnant?|`|AA11915363	o wow and she wat a boy oh no but i doubt if she pregnant mayb she wants to be|`|7RhXX7qfaa	Shes 12?! WTF?? I didn't even think of giving handjobs at that age I doubt I even knew what one was. It is possible she is pregnant but unlikely probably just ate something that didnt agree with her.|`|Xv7xz33laa	It is possible, but very rare. If she hasn't started her period, then its very unlikely. Maybe the stomach ache could be her period coming?    Stacey
uFrqC4Y2aa	Well, first off, it's great that you want to be in your daughter's life. A lot of men, for some reason, aren't that much of a man. Secondly, you need to pursue it legally. You have a child support order... take her to court. She needs to be mature about this and see how she's hurting your daughter.     My dad was in the same boat as you and never gave up. I eventually moved in with him after he continued to take my mom to court. He was the best role model in my life.|`|2isbOuRhaa	take her back to court. the same thing happened to someone i know, the girl was trying to keep this child from him. and he went back to the court and she tried saying he was doing all these negative things, which he wasn't. and they ended up giving him visitation where she HAD to bring the child to a certain place and there was someone that they hired to be there, so they knew the father was getting his visitation. the lady they hired never stayed, she was just there to make sure the mother showed up...     but i would call the courts and find out your options. good luck!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You need to get someone involved like a therapist.  I realize you're not the crazy one and you haven't done what you've been accused of but I advise this so that you can have documentation that will hold up in court that you have not been doing the things you are accused of.  By proactively doing this you protect yourself and protect your daughter.  If not a therapist maybe a lawyer.  There are agencies and programs that will assist you if you can't financially get a lawyer involved.  You can't let it boil down to he say she say because even in 2009 people "want" to believe the mom.  Its just hard to paint her as the vilian no matter how obvious it is.  Good luck to you.      Supporting Dads Who Want To Be Fathers|`|wl7tlYOYaa	U can go back to the court that issued ur child support and visitation orders and tell them she is not living up to her end considering u are doing wat is required by law they will take care of the situation. Dont play along with her she just wants things her way.|`|AA10186411	If you are getting everything the court ordered, there is really nothing you can do.  BUT. If she is refusing visits, then she can get into big trouble for it.  I suggest you speak to your lawyer or case worker.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	go to the court and request for someone to do soemthing about it    you have rights - if she is stopping these rights, then she is going against what the law stated
uFrqC4Y2aa	No. And you wouldn't be experiencing symptoms only 2 days after either.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	possible it it broke and he had pre but other than that no but it would be to early to have signs like that anyway|`|hWc65sEtaa	You wouldn't have symptoms after 2 days, but you can always get pregnant anytime you have sex even with protection.|`|1whTwTbDaa	I you used protection and he didn't ejaculate, then your chances are slim to none. The discharge is normal, your hymen has been broken. If in doubt, go to the doctor.|`|RCoeyHLYaa	PENIS|`|mzFUWq8iaa	i highly doubt you are pregnant. the discharge should go away in a day or two and if it doesnt you should see your doctor.|`|AA11915363	no u couldnt but good u proctected yourself
C5pVfdzwaa	roadblocks|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Statements using like or as are similies not metaphors.|`|4DoXomHZaa	That's not a metaphor.     Most teens see their parents as push over providers, because that is what the parent's actions taught them to think.|`|RAgWVuu4aa	That would be a simile, not a metaphor.    An example of a simile, using the beginning that you gave, could be: most teenagers see their parents as mountains, always watching over them and never letting them be free.    And example of a metaphor, similar to your example beginning could be: teenagers' parents are towering mountains, always watching over them and never letting them be free.      A simile is a comparison using the words like or as to compare. Example: he was LIKE a toad, or the cat was as vicious AS a hungry wolf.    A metaphor is a statement using was, is, and are. Example: the cold WAS a snake slithering up his body.
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	I love both of these names. My husband's name is William and Alexander is my maiden name.   William sounds tougher to me personally!  William (Will) means Strong-willed Warrior  Alexander (Alex) means Defender Of The People  Both meanings sound pretty tough to me!!!!  My cousin who is a female goes by Alex  But I still love both names!!!!|`|HurPmgSaaa	Alexander, hands down|`|dt5oSNQ5aa	They both sound pretty tough so put them together, William Alexander|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Alexander|`|1TTKHz0haa	Alexander|`|TBbhmZEwaa	I have a friend with the middle name Alexander and hes on the chess club. lol.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	Alexander|`|YseGAHIfaa	Alexander|`|rp3jQ7r9aa	I'd go with Alexander, but both have historical associations with strong characters--Alexander the Great, William the Conqueror--so I don't think you can go wrong.
3AVHxNNTaa	did you take a pregnancy test before asking us if you're pregnant or not?|`|MqFeJiukaa	Wait til your period comes that is all you can do then if its late take a test.  How did you find out you were pregnant last time?  Its the same the 2nd time.|`|f5e243b3090fd85449d1a91b415bf5d8aa	If you "done it" even for two minutes without protection you could be pregnant.  NIce writing skills, by the way.|`|b36e29e26342fbcabbaa29541fd8c3ccaa	The (scary) feelings just might be in your head because you know that you were "unprotected" even for no more than 2 minutes.|`|9x9WPoNHaa	If you have not missed your period yet, it would be too early to tell. You could have PMS symptoms, which closely resemble early pregnancy symptoms, or you could be making yourself nervous into believing that you are pregnant. So you would need to wait. Good luck.
uQyrxxmIaa	Zion is pretty and unique  Indigo is also pretty & unique.    Go for it!|`|EevMUAqJaa	It's a little out there. I think of something celestial for some reason.|`|HCWkdk4naa	there might be a lot of gender confusion with zion.  if you like z, you can try zabrina, or ziona, something that ends in a vowel.  zionne.  if I saw that name I would think boy.|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	I like it and you don't have to worry about anyone having her name.|`|qqj7e64Waa	I've always thought of Zion as being a boys name  But i do like the middle name  What about Ziana Indigo v.feminine & pretty  Also it keeps the unique-ness of the name and the Z.I.G initials  Congrats  xxx|`|V1JyuYg8aa	Wow, very cool. I like it a lot. It's definitely new. And when she is little you can call her Ziggy or Indy.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	Love it!|`|LXe08bn8aa	I don't mind Zion... it's different but pretty but I can't say that I like Indigo...|`|kGzzgdaFaa	i think Zion is beatiful but indigo kind of souns like a color but i mean that is totally up to you.
lNucas6Daa	I went to high school with 2 siblings, who transferred to our school, directly from Egypt, when the boy was 13 and his sister was 11.    The boy's name was Nader, and his sister's name was Sally.|`|YseGAHIfaa	Boys:    Zahur  Zihad  Zuberi  Zafeu  Yahya    That's all i could find.    I hope it helps x|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	Akila  Osiris  Issa  Mensah  Isis  Cleopatra  Tabia  Dendera  Eboni  Nefertiti    oops didn't notice you wanted x,y or z. sorry...    um, Zaliki?|`|ZvFamJM8aa	Zyra  Yazmin
UUpsa35Daa	If you don't want her competing and you think taking her will open up a big can of worms then you shouldn't go. Your daughter is probably going to try to insist that she be in one and that'll just turn into and argument.    If you want to show support to your niece than you could go without your daughter, or even just sending her a balloon and cute stuffed animal wishing her good luck before hand would do it.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	Don't take her. You know your child best. if you think she will get jealous and want to do it too then don't bring her. If you want to support your niece and go then get a baby sitter for the night.|`|AA11131747	I wouldn't take her. If you want to support your niece (and your SIL) then you can attend without your daughter.  The cousins can always play dress-up together if they both enjoy it; no need to expose your child to the pagent world and open that can of worms.|`|4cprznZcaa	i wouldnt take my daughter because i think that pageants are child pornography. i would never tell my daughter that for obvious reasons so i would make some other excuse not to go.|`|r07BwhO1aa	I would not take her but what you can do for your niece is go to her house afterwards.|`|rAkWoweOaa	You obviously hate it, so don't take her. Simple as that.|`|nBlSS6HUaa	What pageat is she in? Because the ones my daughter has done they don't allow make up/hair color/fake teeth/fake tans/or "over extreme dress" they just want you in your sunday best. So I would be concerned on that aspect. As for your daughter...just explain to her...'cousin Ashley likes to do this, and it costs lots of money, and we can go watch her, but we can't pertisipate' or something like that.    GOOD LUCK|`|EBTSeJrsaa	i wouldn't take her because beauty pageants are so superficial and to be so young! its sad|`|jpMi2D5Jaa	If it's something you disagree with and you don't want your child exposed to it then just be honest, every parent is different and there's nothing wrong with expressing  your opinion in a kind way.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I would take her and if she says she wants to do pagents then I would come up with a different activity that she could dress really girly and do girly things like a dance class. I would also explain to her why you don't want her to do it.. I know my 6 year old would be upset but she seems to be good with a reason|`|AA11635143	It is so so unfair not to take your daughter to the beauty pageant.  Children don't have as much problem with jealousy and the parents do.  I don't see it as any different from taking her to a pee wee football game to see a cousin play.  It's all about competition.    I seriously doubt that your daughter will be wearing makeup and flirting just because she attended a pageant.  Family should support family and celebrate their accomplishments without making a big issue out of it.
m1RTNmqsaa	Id say that the breastfeeding does play a major role in you not having your period. If it were me tho I would be freaked out & go ahead and ask my doctor. After all Id rather know for sure then to just guess.    Congratulations on your little girls.|`|nTuFIKUAaa	Breastfeeding is to blame. It's your body's natural BC as well - that being said I wouldn't have unprotected intercourse thinking you can't become pregnant.|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	breastfeeding causes that you don'tget your period... it's normal, don't worry.  a friend of mine told me that the first time she got her period was when the kid was 11 months old...|`|rNNvAcq4aa	Your body might not be back to its hormonal cycle; after 4 months...it is likely you could be pregneant again|`|1whTwTbDaa	More than likely its the breastfeeding. Your period won't come back until you stop or at least slow down. It's got to be hard breastfeeding 2...and your body has to keep up all the other functions. It'll come back when you wean them off.|`|HhsjeOoHaa	I only had one baby and didn't breastfeed but for a week, and still didn't have a period for 6 months.|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Could be Hun, But are you having unprotected sex ?  If yes my Mum caught for my brother right away, so i would check this with your doctor or midwife, good luck with your twins x|`|LorcDzoxaa	breastfeeding could very well be causing it. I didnt get my period back when I was breastfeeding until 2 weeks AFTER my daughter was weaned, and she was weaned at 1 year.|`|l79QIWszaa	Breastfeeding it what is causing the lack of "aunt flow".  I didn't have my period for nearly 6 months, and it came soon after I quit breastfeeding.  I'm assuming you had the normal lochia (after birth) flow that could have lasted up until 6 weeks.  If not, you need to talk to you doctor asap.    As stated earlier, you need to be careful while having sex because you could still get pregnant (unless you want to get pregnant, of course).    Age usually doesn't make a difference, but I would recommend enjoying this time that you don't get your period!|`|4ZbJhWuxaa	i unfortunately got mine back right away but it might be hormonal i would check with ur dr|`|j662ezXAaa	Yes, it is perfectly normal. Has absolutely nothing to do with your age.    You could not get a period for the entire time you are breastfeeding, and a month or so beyond. You wouldn't necessarily get a period even if you weren't breastfeeding. It takes several months after pregnancy for the body to clean out all those pregnancy hormones. In the end, every woman is different, it is totally dependant on your hormones and your body.    HOWEVER - Please note that even if you don't get a period, YOU CAN STILL GET PREGNANT. You can never tell if last month was the LAST time you wouldn't get a period and your body is getting ready to ovulate. So, even if you aren't having your period, use birth control (talk to your doctor about the best type for you).|`|Ks7je9MSaa	Don't worry this is normal. Your body is going through some extreme changes at the moment. Your body can take years to get back to normal. And I would say yes to your question about breast feeding adding to the delay.    If your really concerned ask a professional (:|`|9L0Q86pFaa	uuummm.... i think that that isnt normal. but hey! what the heck do i know about that stuff!!!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Breastfeeding can cause your period not to show up but from what my doctor told me you are still fertile even though it doesn't show up...|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	If you are breastfeeding exclusively than that would affect it.  It can delay your period and is actually a good form of birth control provided you breastfeed exclusively, at least every 4 hours, and haven't gotten your period.  It only works for the first 6 months though.    **I wouldn't use this as the only form of birth control only because it comes with so many variables.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Breast feeding could definitely cause this. Your hormones are whacked out right now lol, enjoy it while it lasts! Props to you for being able to breast feed twins!! :)|`|MtC3CWZraa	Plenty of times you won't get a period until you quit breastfeeding. Just DON'T assume that means you can't get pregnant though.|`|hWc65sEtaa	Yes breastfeeding can cause that.  Use protection just in case you don't want to be pregnant so soon.
FdQD8H3qaa	just keep trying things..  some times it just takes a while for them to like something... we used to sneak foods that weren't my son's favorite in between bites of stuff that he liked and we also would mix a bit of applesauce or sweet potato's  in with his cereal so that it had a slight flavor of what he liked..  I never worried about him eating veggies with breakfast verses fruits because it is all pretty much the same and even on the food pyramid fruits and veggies go hand in hand.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Try other finger foods with him. Veggies, fruits, breads, pasta, etc. All of these are good and you can cut them up into tiny pieces. He may just be tired of the pureed foods and I don't blame him! He may play with them more than eat them at first but that's fine, let him explore the different textures and see where he goes with them.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I'm with Noah's Mommy.  I would be skipping the purees at this point, and focusing more on finger foods.  If he doesn't like the biscuits and cheerios, that's fine.  Offer him bites of what YOU are eating.      Since his iron levels are fine, he still doesn't really need much in the way of solids, so try to relax.  When he's ready and hungry, he'll eat.  And better for him to  eat the good stuff (adult foods with flavor and texture) than another jar of puree.|`|cdb2cfce20c19afdeb27847428f89b3eaa	give him double milk as well.    basically take non-fat dry milk powder and mix with whole milk.  this will double all the nutrients that whole milk has.      most babies that do not like to eat other foods, this sometimes is a good solution because it also doubles the protein to 16    Well, i think your baby is still young to have whole milk since he is 10 months.  But you can still ask your doctor.  Some parents start at 2% milk.      Hope this helps..
fZGcufB7aa	Congrats! I love Clara Grace. It's very cute. I think Sienna Jade is Gorgeous. It flows so well,but if you are unsure about it then how about:  Sienna Rose  Sienna Isla  Sienna Harmony  Sienna Gabrielle  Sienna Mae  Sienna Leigh  Sienna Marie  Sienna Hope    I love the name Alexis! I don't think that Lola goes that well with it though. How about:  Alexis Jane  Alexis Rae  Alexis Faith  Alexis Joy  Alexis Madelyn  Alexis Brooke  Alexis Michelle  Alexis Paige  Alexis Danielle    Some other first names could be:  Madison  Sophia   Kayley  Ashlyn  Gabriella  Ella  Elizabeth  Samantha  Natalie  Olivia  Bella  Aurora  Brianna    The best advice I can give you though is to use family names for their middle names. Which it seems like you did. Good luck to you and your 3 little blessings!|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Alexis Jade, Sienna Claire, & Grace Lola-Beth|`|BGIsuNMTaa	O my god Triplet girls, Congratulations and good luck.

Alexis is a name that many other moms have picked though. She will definitely be sharing her name in school.    I like Aurelia, I always have! My daughter's name is Adalyn.    I also like Amelia and Alivia. lol... maybe I just like 'A' names!    You could always do something really cute with all three of their names.    You could do all one letter; i.e. Adalyn, Aurelia, Alivia.    I don't care for Jade. I guess people can't help but to do name by association and Jade just doesn't bring warm feelings!    Good Luck and Congratulations!|`|twyjXSVuaa	Clara Grace is nice. I don't like Clara but I love Grace and the 2 sound nice together.   Sienna I like. Sienna Jade is lovely although...isn't Sienna a coulour? Or is that Sierra. Either way Jade is a colour and Sienna sounds like Sierra and it's a bit wishy washy.  How about Sienna Belle?

winmjHAmaa	I think it's fine.  My name is Brittany, pretty generic, right?  Yeah, ppl still found a way to use that against me.  Kids will be kids and pick whether it's over a name or not.  Guy Thomas Black is a nice, strong name.  Good choice! :)|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I totally think that you should keep the name for its obvious significance to you and your fiancee... but I just don't particularly care for the name. I think of Guy from Food Network, hah.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	I don't particularly care for the name Guy, but it is kinda funny. It's good that you both agree on a name that usually doesn't happen|`|a3MSSvdcaa	It might make him funny, or might bug the heck out him.      I had a friend who wanted to name his son richard harold long so backwards it would be "long harry dick"|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Guy Thomas Black...when I saw that I thought u were talking about a movie title or character.    Not a fan of Guy...and "Black, Guy"...not funny|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	Where I am from it is pronounced "Gee" (with a hard G)   I'm not really a fan of it, but if you both love it go for it! Be prepared though, you can't mold your kid into any personality type, they will be born with their own personality and may not share your sense of humour especially since it is at their expense!|`|8OoqHpbIaa	its ok    my best friend goes out with someone names Andy black|`|6oASoFr7aa	Thats hella silly. your son gon have to grow up to be a comedian if you name him that. maybe not, but I wouldn't do it, sh**t i believe in people right to do what they wanna do.|`|gyoylefvaa	Go for it.  If he don't like his name he 'll go to the court and change for what ever he like.|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	Guy is super odd...like...no. Guy?  Thats like calling a girl Ms or Lady...its just odd.  Lol i have a sense of humor too but im not gonna name my kid something silly like that.|`|OedbpoJvaa	i think its pretty hilarious, but thinking of the kid, he might get teased maybe and really hate the name|`|6kRhLbs9aa	ummm,....He would FOREVER be called "Black Guy" and that is not really funny. And it could be offensive...Sorry. Don't do that to a kid.
eS4CSdQ5aa	very possible     even protection is not 100% effective.    take a blood test at the doctors office|`|nTuFIKUAaa	Soooo, what exactly is the question? you want us to base our answers on the fact that you have nausea, sore breasts, and your tired? those aren't only pregnancy symptoms, but symptoms of your period (which will be due on what, like a week and a half) and some illnesses, or stress.   Wait until you miss a period, take a test and visit your Dr.   If you know you are not willing to have a baby at this point in your life why have unprotected sex every night? that's stupid - use some common sense and use BC!|`|SD0dIDCKaa	At least he wore a condor.
JyWCPVfzaa	No, not good. It sounds too boyish.|`|HurPmgSaaa	I don't really it. And I can't really think of any good middle names that would flow.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I hate it.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Hate it, sorry.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	I think it's cute!|`|izbAdDUraa	I LOVE IT.  i love boyish names for girls.   you could do like Frankie Jade (jade is my middle name lol) or something similar. One syllable would be good or even two, such as frankie marie. have fun with it but don't traumatize your kiddo with some crazy name like Bronx Mowgli lol :]|`|OilQvoLZaa	<333 it|`|kcGFK36Waa	I don't like it specially for a girl.|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	that is a big thumbs down sorry|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I love it! She could be Frances for her full name and Frankie for short?     Can't think of a middle name, but whatever you pick needs to be quite feminine.|`|iUYTvsPEaa	I like it a lot. Will her name be Frances, and that will be her nickname?    How about:  Frankie Jane  Frankie Marie  Frankie Cade  Frankie Reece  Frankie Avis|`|QzBgeyKeaa	Its Cute , ahaha  I actually like it , I have a friend her sister's name is Stevie :)       Something like Frankie Rose                   Or   Frankie Elizabeth  But why not go with naming her Francine , and calling her Frankie for short , that way she will have a femine name for the future , and a good name if she was looking for a job|`|CtVLaAZRaa	My aunt's name is Frankie Lynn. They named her Frankie because my grandfather's name was Frank. I always thought it was very original and I don't know any other women with that name. If you really like it then go with it. My husband's name is Donald and we named our first son Donald and we call him Donny. I got so many thumbs downs from YA for naming him that. He is three and he is a Donny and I couldn't imagine his name being anything else. It is amazing how the child makes the name instead of the name making the child. Go with what you want.|`|eda699c69fc8eaff0f10239e82b318d9aa	I really really don't like frankie for a girl. It sounds kind of.. butch to me. I'm sorry.|`|NmKu7VKTaa	It's ok but kind of boyish.        ks|`|29tiSHnnaa	i totally like it.  maybe like frankie jo.|`|5YKl7uauaa	Why don't you name her Frances and nickname her Frankie?   Just for fun: Anne for a middle name.|`|5AnQQyefaa	I personally love the name  Frankie Evangeline  Thanks and Good Luck!|`|qxnxm0YLaa	HATE IT! It screams old man from the 40's or 50's!|`|nOzQUsToaa	I love the name Frances, it's more feminine. I'm considering it for my future daughter. If I chose it, the nickname would be Frankie. I think it's lovely and reminds me of a fun and sporty girl who has a great sense of humor. Go for it =)|`|wziUVyVoaa	I hate it for a boy, and love it for a girl. It's very unique and very, very cute contrary to what some might say. I think you should definitely go for this. I went to school with two different girls named Frankie, and no one ever made fun of them for it. One of them ended up being Miss Wyoming and the other is a successful lawyer in our hometown. I might spell it without the E though, to make it more interesting and more feminine.    Frankie Peyton  Frankie Alexis  Frankie Blake  Frankie Anna  Frankie Brinny  Frankie Cara  Frankie Delilah  Franie Daniella  Frankie Emma  Frankie Gabrielle  Frankie Hannah  Frankie Haylee  Frankie Leigh  Frankie Adrianna  Frankie Sara  Frankie Rashell  Frankie Deanna|`|FrkF7PaRaa	I don't like it at all. Maybe if you could use it as a nickname, or middle name even...but not as a first name.|`|Y5zFQZSgaa	I'm not a big fan but I've heard it used before.
BW7Nrqjzaa	Try soaking it in some vinegar. I know it seems counter-productive, but it well get smells out and the smell of the vinegar should come out in the wash. I use vinegar to clean everything and anything.    Also try washing it in regular soap, then re-wash it in baby's soap.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	I am wondering what you are washing this in?    Also, why in the world would you toss clothes just cause they messed in them?    We have had plenty of messes and always place some Dawn dish soap on the spots and wash in warm water! We haven't had to toss them and they come out smelling fine.      EDIT: You said, 'I would usually just toss it'... I haven't had to toss anything because she messed in it. If you have washed it, even once, and it still smells... there is obviously an issue with your washing machine or the detergent. My husband works hard at his job and his clothes smell horribly of sweat! I wash them once and they don't smell... hence the term 'wash'.|`|a74d44d56104ce959f7bc2d895568e36aa	LOL at this one. I know the feeling !!! Try soaking it in detergent with softner overnight. Then wash it as usual. It should do the trick.|`|dyHfmN53aa	wash in vinegar or bakin soda. or try bac-out by bio klean is another alternative.|`|0ZskTSifaa	Ugh, babies are just disgusting, chubby, screaming things.  Gross.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	I agree with Dell...the vinegar helps tremendously.  I have soaked receiving blankets and bedding in vinegar in my washer with a tub of water/vinegar after my daughter had exploded in her diaper a couple of times when she had a tummy bug.  Then washed them in Dreft and the smell was completely gone.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I would toss a little OXYclean in with your wash the next time you wash it.  Just use your normal detergent and about a quarter of a cup, or one scoop of OXYclean.  That should take care of it.|`|DmpFFcoBaa	what i would do is pretty much drown it in shout..lol not drown but spray it all over, and wash it then i would put it in the dryer with a dryer sheet it smells a bit better but after the time the smells go away
C5pVfdzwaa	Well, you kind of do tell everyone what they say.    If you tell someone 'don't tell him I told you, but this happened...' then you're betraying their trust.  If you want them to trust you then don't talk about your friends to other friends, even if you can't see the direct harm in it.    They'll forget about it soon enough.  If you keep their discretion and they still get mad at you, they are just looking for drama.|`|4DoXomHZaa	The 1st story no, but the other two, YES you are a loud mouth.    You don't read people's emails to others, and just because you think a relationship is over doesn't give you permission to talk crap. It's none of your business.    Keep it up, you won't have any friends. Time to grow up and learn to keep your mouth shut.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	You need to understand that when someone tells you something that you shouldn't tell anyone else...keep your mouth shut.    However, with the abusive father, you should tell an adult.  If someone is in danger then it's okay to tell someone who will help!|`|V5akMpDAaa	i agree with your friends, i think. even if you're not doing it on purpose its still happening, so you should probably lay low for a while.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Sounds like they're right.  Keeping your mouth shut appears to be a problem for you.  Your friends know that you will rationalize any situation in order to "spill the beans" and make it look like you are "in the know."      Keeping a secret means KEEPING it, and not thinking that there's some sort of time limit on keeping it.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	I think you should be talking to your friends instead of asking this on yahoo answers. We really know nothing about you, your friends, or your secret-keeping history.  apologize & keep your mouth zipped from now on. somehow you have to gain their trust back.  good luck|`|eOZvYxJTaa	just keep your mouth shut. dont give your two cents if its unnesasary.
AA11212578	You'll have to explain a little history but not a lot.   Say something like:    "Thanks for the advice but my daughter has a medical condition that makes it hard for her to potty train.  Not a big deal and nothing to worry about, she'll just have to wait until she's a little older to potty train"    If they ask what it is,  tell them it's VUR, it's hard to describe and they can find it on the web for a better explanation.        Hope this helps....|`|NAbZ5FEwaa	You don't explain, Just politely interupt them when they begin to give advice, and say "thank you so much for the concern but my wife and I are handleing this our way; and we'd appreciate it if you could leave the issue alone." and leave it at that.|`|rroE37HTaa	Honestly I would just get a bunch of print outs on VUR and the next time "nosy Nelly" offers advise hand her one! Tell the person to please NOT discuss this issue around your daughter! They also make thin pull ups for children that won't create the bulk a diaper will. They can come in handy when you go out..and get the crazys from the mall yelling about a kid that size in diapers..your main concern is for your daughters well being-she is old enough to hear and understand the stupid comments, and can be hurt by them!   You are so right, this is not your daughters fault, and you are handling it well. Best of luck..|`|lGSUToFQaa	say thank you for your advice but my wife and i are in agreement on how we are raising our children. it's not rude, you are a nice man cause i'd tell people they need to mind their own children, that's what i told my mil she was going on cause i'm teaching the baby spanish even though he's only 6 mo and i told her that she doesn't have an opinion cause her mom raised 4 of her kids and my hubby's sis raised him till he was 10 so she needed to mind her own business or have another kid. so i think you are a great man, good luck, with everything.|`|28ZCfGWIaa	I'd just say:   "I appreciate the advice but we understand her and know what's best, she'll come around when she's ready."|`|780ByZVEaa	you don't have to explain anything. You could politly just say thank you and let it go. But as soon as you would say your daughter has a medical condition and walk away no one will bring it up again. You won't have to explain the whole thing.  I hate it when other parents think they know better.
PVMsr2Faaa	Is that for a wet-dream|`|q8bJzyUaaa	ok, wth is that?|`|NeTNnvSZaa	You will have to pay dearly but they are out there.  Try the personals.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You can't.

They are a group that promotes breast feeding and you can find them in most major cities.  They might be able to point you in the right direction.  That is as long as  you actually have an infant.|`|cCdhHyF8aa	unless your 12 months and under, (which by the sound of it your mental status is) but you do not nutritionally need one. Besides at one point in time you DID have one....your mother.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	Your mom was your first wet nurse.|`|1b4968638c1deed56c6296be9dbf1339aa	I'm going to assume that you can't breast feed for one reason or another. I hope it's not because you just don't WANT to, because that would just be sad. Breastfeeding helps form a bond between the mother and child.     My mother had inverted nipples and could have done the work to change it but decided to bottle feed instead. I see this as selfish. If you're willing to go through the pains of childbirth, why wouldn't you bother to provide your children with the food that nature intended for them?     I hope you're not looking just so you can "preserve your breasts integrity."    I will assume that maybe you had your breasts removed from cancer or some other reason and you want to give your child the best beginning you can. I would talk to your Dr. and see if anyone is available for that purpose in your area. I doubt that you'll find anyone willing to breast-feed your child in this day and age, but if there is someone, you would have to be able to house the woman as well as pay her. I can't imagine this would be cheap either.     I'd ask your doctor and Lamaze teachers and midwives and La Leche League and others in your community.     Good luck.|`|SXcuvHxHaa	ill i just found out what it is. it is when another woman breast feeds your baby|`|ubbj3VOuaa	You'll pay out the nose for it - try google.  I"m sure you can get all kinds of weird websites that have lactating women.
1hciyvKdaa	Maybe try going to a fabric store, finding what you like, then buy dark material that will be matching the color of one of the designs in the curtain material. If you do not sew, you can glue gun the fold and slide those on the bar of the rod, and then put a small thin collapsable rod behind the installed one, and glue gun the fold and slide on the darker ones behind the installed ones. That way you can open and close both as needed.|`|LydL7EN6aa	Walmart and Kmart have nice curtains for cheap! sometimes JC Pennys and Dillards and SOMETIMES macys have nice sales on them too :)|`|8BuiKlILaa	Walmart fo sho|`|uXMqQ6GNaa	Ikea, Walmart, marburn or brylane home|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I could not get blackout curtains in kid colors anywhere on the cheap. Even the blackout curtains that you attach to regular curtains from Walmart is $35 + a project! For 8 dollars at walmart you can get the "magic shade" which is a roll up shade. We hid its ugliness under cute pink curtains (blue in our sons) and it was much more cost effective. Good Luck!|`|4mRClnP8aa	I bought some from JCPenny, about $20.00 dollars for 2, (one window).  They work great, I also put them in my room.  They are called like you said, Blackout curtains.  Try JCPenny.com|`|lPIV8Pymaa	target  walmart  ikea  kmart  jc penny  sale section in lines&things  not sure if sears or macys do  maybe in a sale section in bed bath& beyond|`|ps9EroF0aa	you could go to walmart or someplace like that. I think it would be cool to get like a black or very dark colored curtain and then a cute pink or some colored curtain and put them together. Like the black one first and then put a pink one in front of it. but of course you would have to soe them together. that just popped in my head i think its brilliant. I might have to try it for my daughters room..
JyWCPVfzaa	Not Willow or Camden please. Nicole is alright, but way too common...at least around my area. The other are ok, but just ok. Try to come up with another list, BUT if you like them that's you and you should always be you.    Now, for the boys. Lets see... Not Atticus, Nicodemus or Kenton.

wWdMcbvGaa	trust you mom. she has been wearing bras a lot longer than you.|`|0td65n04aa	The 36 is the length around your chest and the a or b is the cup size.  To find your correct size meausure your chest just under the breasts this is the number of the the bra size.  To get your cup size measure yourself again around the breast at the nipple for every inch larger than the first measurement it is a cup size.  So 1 would be A cup size, 2 would be B cup size, 3 would be C cup size and so forth.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	The 36 or number measurement) is the measurement around your rib cage, so the size of the elastic part that you have to do up with hooks.    The letter (b or c, etc) is the size of the actual cup (your boob!) part. So you can change that size but stay a 36. It can also go the other way-you can go up number wise but stay the same letter wise.    I hope that helped!|`|DD5CMWfkaa	it depends on where it is tight at, is it too tight in the strap area or in the cup area? If it's too tight in the strap area, you need to move to a 38 of whatever cupsize you are, if it's too tight in the cup size but the band is okay, then move up a cup size.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	The letter behind the number is the "cup" size - the closer to the start of the alphabet the smaller the cup, which represents the size of each breast itself.  The "number" has to do with the distance around your whole chest.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	It depends on where its tight at.  Is it tight around your chest or where your bra cup is? If its around your chest then you need to go up in number but if its cup then letter.  You could go to a department store and they can measure for you that way you know for sure which one you need to do.  Sometimes thats the easiest thing to do.|`|bppI7Pxzaa	Its better to go into a bra shop where you can get measured for free, but if you don't want to i will give you some information.  Okay so if the bra is tight around the back part, it will mean you will be a 38b( if you was a 36a to start with ) but if its not tight around the back but it is at the front you will be a 36c.    I hope i helped =)  x|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Visit the included link.|`|s30Duwdraa	It depends where it is tight.  Do your boobs pop out or does the bra ride up in the back?  if so, it is too small.     The best thing to do is to get fitted by a professional. They usually have one anywhere they sell bras.  you'll probably be surprised at your size once you find out.    good luck!|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	36 is the size of the strap that goes around your chest.

WjgeWHYVaa	Bardot uses the French spelling (of course): Brigitte (Pronounced: bree-ZHEET)  pronunciation: http://forvo.com/word/brigitte_bardot/    much prettier than Brigette (?Pronounced: BRIJ-?t?)      otherwise, try using the Celtic forms:   Bridget (Pronounced: BRIJ-?t)  Brighid (Pronounced: BRIED)  Brigid (Pronounced: BRIED)    anyway, it's a nice tribute to an icon|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Bridgett is one my best friend's daughter's name, and I think it is beautiful, I think it would have been in my top three names if my friend hadn't of already used it.

33h5R8nTaa	Its fine, she is just reasuring herself that she said it right. at 3 its commonf or them to do this. I work in a child care place and i have seen it many times. sometimes kids even do it in normal voice. as long as she is hitting all her milestones she is fine.|`|luVA2iVmaa	She'll be fine, I did that when I was a child also. I think its some kind of obsessive compulsive thing. I was about 7-10 when I did it.  Just tell her doctor so they can keep an eye on it.|`|1H2GN6aAaa	I don't want to over-worry you or anything, but I have an aunt who is autistic and she does the same thing.  It's called echolalia (SP?).    I would have a speech pathologist screen her maybe.
OCk7I8JVaa	Some women do have implantation at 4dpo. However, I do know that being on fertility medication can make you cramp more than you normally would. I am on my second round on clomid. Last month I cramped at 7dpo and every day from 10dpo until AF. I knew not to get my hopes up but it's still hard. I shudder to think how much money and how many emotions I have wasted on HPT's. Just took one today, waaaaay too early (9dpo) and it was negative. It was pretty much what I was expecting, don't know why I did it.  I wish I knew why the cramping happened. I do know that at 3 or 4 dpo, the zygote starts traveling from the fallopian tube to the uterus. Not sure that you would be able to feel that though.  Good luck this month! Did you have good follies?|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I had lots of cramping and discomfort after the trigger shot so maybe it is that.  My nurse told me that the ovaries continue to stay super-stimulated after the shot.  Also it can increase bloodflow to the uterus in preparing for hopefully implantation.  So that can cause some cramping in that area as well.  I agree with you in that it is most likely too early for implantation.  I am betting it is just side effects from the meds.  I am 6 dpo and my temp was even higher 2day!  Best wishes!|`|yCR6qg0baa	An egg is fertilized in the upper third of the oviduct. It takes four days for the egg to travel down the tube. Implantation does not occur until 5-12 DPO. Cramping 3 or 4 DPO would not be pregnancy related.     Are you 100% sure of when you ovulated? Sometimes I can feel myself ovulating & it's off & on mild cramps.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Let me just tell you. People say ohh you can't feel anything at 4dpo. I DID. and I turned out pregnant. You are on fertility meds like I was. So hang in there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It may be that your ovary's may be a little bit sore since they aren't used to the whole ovulation thing but trust me. I knew a few days after ovulation something was different! TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DkVqOe8Iaa	It all depends on whether you pass them and what grade you get.    For university you need 2/3 highers at minimum and they all vary on grades and it also depends what course you want to do. Like for example, law is usually like straight A's and B's over one sitting. Some courses though are B's and C's. It all depends what course you want to do and which uni you want to go to.    My recommendation would be to do as well as you can in your two highers and your three int 2's. Then in S6 you could carry on your subjects that you took at int2 but do them at higher. This shows commitment to your subjects.    Also I'm a bit confused as to how you can only have two standard grades and were allowed to choose three int2's and 2 highers in completely different subjects? In my school you wouldn't even be allowed to stay on to 5th year with only 2 standard grades. Also if you say got a 2 in SG Pe you would then be able to choose that at higher because you got credit level and french would be an int 2 because you got a general grade. That's how it works at my school anyway.    If you really want to go to uni at the end of S5 though, you could go onto the ucas website and complete an online application form. This costs 15. You will then get conditionals (therefore you need to get the grades that the uni offers in order to get in). When you receive an offer from all the uni's you apply to, you get a deadline to choose a firm offer (this is which one you really want) and an insurance choice (if you don't get the grades for your firm choice). Or you could wait until clearing. Clearing starts after the exam results arrive in August. It basically involves you phoning up a uni and asking about a course. You tell them your grades and they can offer you a course there and then on the phone.    In terms of jobs....with a good grade in higher English you'll go far. Employers always look at the main subjects like English, Maths and history is a good subject too. Personally I was never interested in science and even though highers in sciences are good to have unless you want to do something sciency then they never really come into much use. Thats just my opinion and my personal likings. It all depends on what type of career you want to do. If you want to do something like a forensic scientist, in the NHS or medicine etc then science is great. However if you want to be like a journalist, writer etc subjects like English and modern studies are great or if you want to work in an office or in IT then computing, admin, business studies etc are good choices. Without knowing what type of career you want its difficult to determine whether your subjects will be relevant for your career. What I would say though is that you have chosen a wide range of different subjects which is a good thing. It means you can keep your options open.    I wish you good luck in what ever you choose to do. I left school last May 2008 after S6 and I know what the whole uni process is like and the stress of trying to get the right grades for uni.|`|OPtu5dXuaa	This is from Glasgow Uni but most others will be very similar.  I have a friend who has been accepted there to do law.    Highers  AAAAB including English (one sitting).    Conditional offers may be made to SQA applicants in their sixth year who achieved between ABBBB to AAABB in fifth year.    Applicants are encouraged, where possible, to study Advanced Highers in Arts/Social Science subjects in sixth year.    I'm afraid it looks like you may have to think of a different route, maybe look at college first?    You probably didn't get many answers because of the fact you are from scotland (I am too), sucks doesn't it!
ZGXxP4vRaa	Just eat healthy food and then when you eat so much it isn't going to be as much of a big deal.  Don't worry about weight gain so much and give your baby what he/she needs.  I've always had that happen off and on through-out my pregnancies and I've never gained more then 15 pounds each time.  Protein is great.  Maybe try eggs, peanut butter on toast and things like that to help fill you up.|`|joPJtKemaa	Eat away.   I was the same way, I was starving every couple of hours and then gradually it fades away when you start getting closer to your second trimester. You will get back to normal.    Do not deprive yourself of food, especially when your baby's heart and all the organs are developing.|`|GIqACtxvaa	Eat when your hungry for sure.  Just make then smart healthy protein packed snacks.  Like 100-200 calories is perfect for a snack. Some of my heal faves are     1cup canned pineapple sprinkled with 2 tbsp walnuts or almonds    2 whole grain melba toast spread with jelly preserves and a cup of non-fat milk    3/4 cup plain low-fat yogurt 3/2 mixed berries, 1tsp honey    1oz whole grain pretzels with mustard    1 slice low fat cheese on whole grain crackers|`|qFcVN119aa	Just try to do other things to get food of your mind and you have to be very careful with what you eat because if you gain too much wait you could get diabetes like i did when i became pregnant with my son and I gained alot of wait just becareful|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	It's okay during the first couple months your body is adjusting and giving the baby all the energy to develop. It's common so don't worry. You sleep and eat more, in return you pee more too! Congrats!
dNhgIMIPaa	It's called Separation Anxiety and all little kids have it at some point. It's normal. My daughter is 18 months and does the same thing. It can be something as easy as going to the bathroom and not bring her with me, and she will freak out and cry. If I leave for work and her dad watches her, she cries. Usually just a couple minutes. She probably only is going to get more attached. But don't worry they will eventually grow out of it. :)    This site will hopefully help you out.  http://kidshealth.org/parent/emotions/fe...|`|K7f3B4scaa	My daughter is the same way and she is 13 months as well. Alot of the time I'm all she see's (besides daycare) because her dad is a restaurant GM and he works long hours and some days she doesn't even get to see him cause he'll be sleeping or working. It's quite sad at times because sometimes she wont even let him give her a hug or a kiss. We are what they are used to cause we are all they see.|`|4mRClnP8aa	I know what you are going through and to tell you the truth, it's our faults as new moms.  My son is 16 months old and I still have to hold him while I am cooking or doing any other thing around the house.  We have no family here, I am the only one who watches him, ever.  My husband works long hours, so he is home for dinner and then bedtime.  On the weekends, I TRY to let my husband play with him or take him places wihtout me, but I usually end of going with them.  Because I feel guilty.   I don't know what it is.  I guess, I feel like I have to be the best, but I am really hurting my son for the long run.  I know it's my fault.  So, it sounds like to me she is having a little seperation anxiety, maybe....  Just try and have your husband hold her as often and play with her as much as possible, even if she wants you to hold her, tell her daddy loves her and go on about what you were doing.  Thats what we've been trying... Its working on some days.  Some days not.  I know it's frustrating to let her cry, but she is with her daddy and it is fine.  Thought I would share with you what sounds like the same thing.  GOOD luck!|`|1F7eYuNWaa	My child was very much this way.  It's a stage that many kids go through.  I think it is fine to hold her; I don't think it is possible to spoil a child with too much love and affection.  It won't make her become too dependent on you, either.  This stage will pass quickly and she will start becoming a "big girl."  But you will be glad that you spent time with her and never denied her your attention.  Kids should know that they are very high on their parents' priority list.    Sometimes, though, you have to get things done.  I have a backpack carrier that lets my child ride on my back while I work around the house.  But it's also okay to let her cry a little while you are draining the pasta.  Better that than have her get burned.  She'll be fine.    This stage will probably taper off when she starts walking, and disappear around 18 months of age, when she finally has the attention span to play by herself.  Believe it or not, you might actually miss being the center of her existence!|`|Dhsyroekaa	i think it is just a stage, but if you pick her up everytime she will get use to it and know she will get her way if she cries. So its good to let her cry so she knows that she cant always have what she watns|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Normally I would say that you have to let her cry, but since she's not been like this and it started suddenly I'd say it is a stage.  Just be careful about picking her up too much and watch and see if it passes.|`|OGNBOaKyaa	MY SON IS THE EXACT WAY!!! Let her cry!!! even if it gives you a migraine, you have to let her know that you are the boss!!    I pretty much spoiled my son, he is 13 months now...when my dad came to visit, he was in shock on how much i spoiled him. so he gave me that bit of advice, and im working on training him to be independent!    P.S. Do you hear that?....Thats my son crying right about now, and no, im not gonna pick him up!! :)    And no, im not saying neglect your child so you can be on the computer...im only saying to let them explore on their own, its all new to them, and its going to take some time, but pretty soon, your child will be used to it...|`|AA12243380	She's only a year old so if you can hold her and snuggle her then I say do it because she has PLENTY of time to learn that she can't "get her way."    My twins aren't allowed to climb onto the table because it's not safe and yes they cry when I make them stop doing it.  That's a reasonable expectation that they can't just get their way.    I don't think that denying a child affection is good, though... especially so you can screw around on the computer.  If you're not doing something critical then give your kid attention if they want it!  That's not spoiling, it's *parenting.*    Of course, if you're doing something then you're not denying your child affection for the sake of denying them affection.  You're busy doing something important.    My twins drive me NUTTY a lot of the time while I'm cooking and I think it's because they're mad that they can't be in the kitchen with me but they're really tall and my only big burners on the stove are within their reach.  It's not safe for them to be in the kitchen while I cook so no, they can't get their way despite their cries for my attention.    If I'm not busy, though, I give them attention.    All I'm saying is, don't deny her affection and attention for the sake of denying it to teach her to be independent because it will probably backfire on you and make her even MORE clingy... but do what you have to do and don't feel guilty if she cries when you're sitting on the toilet or cooking a meal.    Good luck to you!
gPeEdjmuaa	Haha, I know how it feels! I have to babysit a 4 year old, 8 year old, and 9 year old... and my cousin just had another baby so that means an infant baby is added to my babysitting horray! lol.    This is what I usually do:    If it's nice out, we go outside and play hide and seek, tag, frisbee, volleyball, whatever the girls feel like doing. Then we sit in a circle while we rest and play hot potato with the volleyball while someone sings (this might be hard for you because that's not fun with 2 people)    You could let her play school or store and she be the chashier or teacher. Ask her mom if she can bring 1 or 2 of her favorite toys over and you guys can play with them together.     For some ideas to get her out of the house, lol, here's what I do:    1.) Go swimming in the baby pool or hook up the sprinkler  2.) Chuck E. Cheeses (I know that costs well over 5 dollars, but if you do it on one occasion, she will LOVE YOU FOREVER!)  3.) Go to the park together  4.) Are there any local zoo's semi-close to where you live? Usually admission is free, and you could just bring snacks and drinks in a cooler)  5.) National Parks   6.) Wal- mart or dollar store and let her pick out something cheap (like a key chain, or candy, or floam)  7.) Play-do outside :)   8.) Make forts with blankets inside if it is too cold outside  9.) Go ice-skatting at a iced lake or sledding on a hill  10.) Bake cookies together (you could pretend like your Rachel Ray, my cousins LOVE doing this)  11.) Go to the library and read books together   12.) Get ice-cream together   14.) Take a walk around the neighborhood    There are lots of fun things to do on a cheap/almost free budget. I'm only 15, so I know how you feel about not wanting to spend your paycheck on kids that can be annoying sometimes, lol!    *I will add to the list if I can think of other things...|`|2dwOKHw3aa	I like the idea of going to the park thats sounds like fun! I would see if like you could read books, or do crafts, and especially coloring! Kids love to color or at least the ones i babysit do!  If you find things  that they like there is a website where you can get free coloring pages. i think its  www.freecoloringpages.com|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Why not watch her at her own house where she has toys and games? You don't need to spoil her to entertain her.

Name your baby with love it cannot be wrong.
10b1R3ibaa	Well it's nearly 8pm here as well. I have Anna, who is five and Brody, my stepson who is eight, both at school. My husband is away with work at the moment, so I am trying to be as organised as possible! He normally does the school run because he's on flexi-time, where as I have to be in at eight and out by three. He drops them off, I pick them up.    Today was also Anna's birthday (they're growing up so fast) so i was up till god knows wrapping up Bear Factory outfits plus one of those little kid cameras that they can throw out of the window and still take photos with, and then as soon as I got to bed, cockaldoodle doo, time to get up again.    We did the unwrapping ceremony in Mummy and Daddy's bed with Daddy on speaker phone (even though it was about midnight in America) and when Anna had taken off EVERY piece of sellotape she finally got into the presents. We then spent the next fifteen minutes posing for photos until I realised the time and practically threw the kids into their school uniforms and made Anna birthday breakfast, ie toast with a smiley jam face on it. Took them to school and got home, finally able to actually breath.    I spent the next hour doing ironing and catching up on Grey's Anatomy- I'm behind already and its been on for what, two weeks? Then I met my best friend in town for a coffee and a catchup, and had a fun old morning with her newest baby, Alice. We then went maternity clothes shopping, seeing as when I was with Alice it was winter and this time it will be mostly summer.    Then, all of a sudden, it was time to pick Anna and Brody up from school, run home and take Brody to his karate lesson club thing- some call us mothers but I personally prefer the term chauffer. Me and Anna took this time to do a spot of mother-daughter bonding, by taking photos of the same thing with each of our cameras. I'm trying slowly to turn Anna into a mini-photographer and it seems like she's going to be the kind that specialise in 'abstract' art, ie. look a piece of grass! a cloud!... you gotta love them!    Time to take Brody home and have tea AND CAKE! Set off the smoke alarm, although after seven years in this house I still have no idea how to turn it off, so I ended up hiding it in the airing cupboard while the kids snuck extra pieces of cake. I had Anna bathed and in bed by 6.45pm and then me and Brody struggled with spelling (you may have noticed it's not my forte) until 7.15pm when 'we' finally managed it and he went off up to bed. Then I decided I was due a bit of me time, and I'm playing sims2. Call it an addiction.    And now I'm looking forward to the same thing tomorrow!  Sorry for such a long answer!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Hey what about dads?  I got called into school cause my kid was beating on other kids...then i got called into pre school cause my daughter was spitting food at people. Cant they control that?  Then i went back to work...picked them up again...sat down to relax to find that my 4 year old pissed on the couch....and my cat crapped right next to the toilet (true story). The days not even half over yet...|`|s5cxHMrPaa	here is my day!  I woke up with my both kids at 6:30am (2 year old Tristan and 4 week old Bella). I got Tristan dressed and brought him downstairs to play with his grandma who is visiting this week. Bella went back to sleep for another hour so i got to read my book and finish it - finally (Full Moon by S. Meyer). Now I have to start my new baby book so I remind myself what the heck I am doing here with the newborn. Next I made breakfast and we all ate (except I ended up eating while walking my crying baby around). I got myself and the baby dressed for the day and we all went to visit great grandma. My sister in law brought her son so the kids were playing while I had to carry my baby girl, who just wouldn't sleep. Came home, my mother in law put Tristan to sleep for his nap and I fed Bella and I am hoping she will fall asleep in the baby swing. So far she is just looking hypnotized. Now how funny - Tristan would go down for her but not for me.... so starting on Monday we are nap free again....   It is the middle of the day here so I have another half in front me. Sometimes I just feel worn out and I feel like I don't want to do this anymore!!!! And the winter weather is keeping us locked inside so that doesn't help.   Hey, how do you get your baby to sleep in the evening without struggle? My 4 week old sleeps good through the night (wakes up like 2x or 3x  - but it takes me like 30 mins to an hour to put her down (she falls asleep and when I lay her down, she wakes up after 5 mins realizing that no one is holding her and so she starts screaming. i come back, pat her, pick her up if she is screaming her head off and she falls asleep. After few times she is finally down. What is your strategy???? i love to hear about other mother's day - i feel i am not going crazy alone!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	Are you in London? Well, let me tell YOU about my crazy day.   I have 5 children. Three from a previous marriage and 2 from my current boyfriend. I am totally refusing to marry again and if he pushes a ring on me I am going to run away with the kids.    Anyway, their names are:Natalia-13, Michael-10, Rosanna-8, Carla-7,Utopia-2.  They are all wild but I surely keep them in line.    We have tea about every two hours. They are so hooked on the sugar!  I don't take them to school because they wouldn't do very well at all. I don't have many friends because of my negative mentality.  Anyway, so around 4am we all got up and worked on the farm. I live near Surrey.  We took the trolley to the lifts at the school-day care.    Then I "played" at home with my boyfriend and his girlfriend.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I took my son to school later bc we had a nasty snow storm and I could not manage to waddle through the snow until people had a chance to shovel.  Im officially 33 weeks pregnant today.  So I spent the rest of my afternoon feeling yucky.  I had some people come to my door to shame me into changing to their "hydro" company.  This was a environmental one.  My husband has told me to tell them all to get lost regardless of their stance.  So it was hard not to slam the door in their face when they accused me of not caring for the environment.  Got rid of them by telling them to come back and talk to him when he is home from work.  I got money out for pizza for dinner bc the thought of cooking dinner has me grossed out.  Resisted the urge to toss the cat out in the snow.  She has been in heat off and on since Nov.  Im too angry and hormonal to deal with a yowling cat.  The bad weather and the fact that its not my cat has saved her so far.|`|NGKwsawdaa	You had your hands full today! As for me, I woke up and made breakfast for my 3 year old daughter, put some cartoons on, hugged and kissed her goodbye, and left her home with daddy. I got to work 10 minutes early, had my coffee and been non stop at work since the morning. It is 2 p.m here now and its time for my yahoo answers break and lunch. I get out at 5:30 and will go home to a cozy house and my family, relax and enjoy the night! Yay me!|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	You really don't want to know but here goes it is about 3:00pm where I am. I started off the day pretty good my almost 3 year old slept in her room most of the night so that is great progress. Now I have a home daycare so I have 5 toddlers all day and today they have been bad bad bad no one listens, hitting running pushing just one of those days. Then I had a dentist appointment where they proceed to tell me that they want thousands of dollars to fix one little old tooth ughhh, then I call my insurance co because some one vandelized my car last night dents & paint scratched off only to find out that my in-laws (our car is in their name, we took over payments on a car they couldn't afford) upped our deductible from 100 to 500 and lowered my liability just to save themselves 10.00 per month. Now I have 5 kids that are going to be waking up from nap soon, my house is a mess because I was gone to the denist all morning. And my hubby is working late, hopefully tonight won't be too hard getting my little one into bed on time.    Good luck to your family today!!!!
AA10196172	Yes, the tests often read negative because you don't produce enough hGC. In that case, a doctor's blood test is much more sensitive.    Anothr possibility: If your period was due the 25th, then your likely ovulation day was the 11th. If you did not have sex in the range of about the 8th to 12th, then likely you would not have conceived.    The big "however!" in using timing is that like period timing, ovulation timing can occasionally be wildly off. The human body is full of surprises. This is why the secret to conception is to have sex early and often. If you don't want to conceive, don't trust the calendar.    So if you had sex on the 13th and didn't ovulate until 2 or 3 days later, you may have conceived as late as the 16th, let's say. Or, the 19th to the 22nd from door  2?     Most HPT suggest testing "once you're overdue", implying 2 weeks after conception. So if it was door 1, 2 weeks later is 16+14=30th. Door  2,  22+14=36 or as late as Feb 5th.    So there you go. Try again in a day or two, and if you still don't like the answer, try again around the 5th. If you still don't believe the negative answer, get tested at the doctor.     Late periods aren't always pregnancy - they can be caused by all sorts of things, like sickness, stress and worry, low weight, PCO, or just interesting hormone sensitivities.|`|JsshzKM9aa	You very well could be. Wait another week or so and test.|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	It could be possible. It's all about the time of your ovulation. Try taking a test in a few days and see if that works. Good luck and baby dust!|`|gga2mwFIaa	I usually wait 2 weeks after my missed period to get the most accurate results because usually hcg levels don't read until the 5th or 6th week. So wait a couple weeks and take another one.|`|E4oQWYHpaa	that same thing is happening to me.  i had sex the 16th and 17th and my period was supposed to come the 26th.  29th and no sign of period coming.  i did take a test yesterday but it was negative also.  are you having any symptoms?
DuLhv7Ajaa	I had that with all three of my pregnancies.Right now you body is producing massive quantities of hormones that cause muscles and ligaments to relax, in preparation for birth. You're going to find little aches and pains that you never had pre-pregnancy because your body is literally loosening up for "the big day". If it seems excessive talk to your doctor, but more than likely you're fine.|`|E9dGOVs0aa	i had that with my first daughter 7 years ago, it would stop me too it feels like someone is stabbing your insides. it is called round ligament pain and it is perfectly normal. i am 39 weeks and havent had it as much with this one because i guess my body is already stretched out and remembers lol. it is normal. it will pass. good luck.|`|Ez1eFeZ2aa	First of all, congrats on your pregnancy.  I am 36 weeks pregnant, and have had those exact pains on and off my entire pregnancy.  the doctor said it is my body's way of stretching places that don't normally stretch.  It is completely normal as long as you don't have any bleeding.  I hope this helps, and good luck.|`|RcOAMAahaa	there called growing pains i got that to when i was pregnant its uncountable|`|gRZT4pnUaa	I had those pains too. I have a blood disorder called landon 5 factor. I had to take blood thinner injections twice a day. I just thought that was the cause of it. Maybe you should call your doctor and ask about it. Maybe they could tell you what the problem is. Sorry i wasnt much help, but i hope everything works out for the best.

wrVRj1O5aa	You can be pregnant. You could be going through PMS. The only way to be sure is call your doctor you might have fribriods in your uterus that's common in women and could be confused for pregnancy|`|aWkp6AJOaa	you could have a case of really bad gas. :)  this happens with me sometimes, not for sure about the bleeding though, i guess it could be a cyst also.  if you are having a tubal or etopic preg. then you can take a test & it will show up positive.  maybe call the nurse at your dr's office & maybe she can help you out.  good luck.|`|hFQa24wOaa	Just test.     Duh|`|0Wt4QGgJaa	Consult a Professional. Pregnancy's are a medical minefield when trying to deal with on the internet. It is entirely possible that you are pregnant. Condoms and pills alone cannot have a 100% efficiency.    And if you are pregnant congratulations!|`|6qNYzZC2aa	to be honest i would go see your doctor asap it don't sound like pregnancy could be and assist maybe in your lower abdominal that can have an affect on period i really would go to doc s first thing in morning|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Go to the doctor and get yourself checked out. This is the best thing you can do. Seek medical attention.|`|JsshzKM9aa	You need to see a doctor ASAP!
fHjSonssaa	sweet potatoes (my son LOVES them)  baby carrots  peas  brocolli (sp)    any veggie that has no peel/skin and isn't stingy is good.  we just put them in a blender and add a little water and puree them    I don't think it's necessary to to mix breastmilk with the food.  If you were to do cereal- then yes.  You've probably already talked to your DR about it- but I was always under the impression that rice cereal sort of preps their tummies for real food.  Plus the iron in the cereal is really good for them.  We use an Organic rice cereal- Happy Bellies.  It's sort of newer- they do have it at Target.  It's a brown rice cereal.    Pears, applesauce, and purieed fruits (no grapes or oranges) are great also.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	It depends on the consistency and the baby. If you have "extra" milk it's not going to hurt to throw it in there though. Otherwise a little bit of water to help thin thicker foods out it fine.    I used sweet potatoes a whole lot in the beginning. I also "mouth feed". Which means I chew up whatever we're eating and feed him.|`|a74d44d56104ce959f7bc2d895568e36aa	Check this website out http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com|`|dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Pears  Vitamins: A, C, Folate    Minerals: Potassium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Calcium     1.

iFAlZfVMaa	HELL YEAH, you can absolutely limit the people around your baby.  YOUR BABY!!!  My sister's newborn is now 3 wks and her ped said that, especially during flu season, the baby should not be near ANY CHILDREN that attend school or play groups... basically no kids at all for the first month.      No one, no matter who they are, is ENTITLED to be around your child.  Set limits and stick to them... make no exceptions because that causes MORE problems.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	of course. you make the decisions with your baby.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	ABSOLUTELY  this is YOUR baby, if you are uncomfortable with ANYONE around it, let them know  but you can do it in a nice way  tell your friend that you don't want any children around the baby until he gets older  your friend will understand, she probably felt the same way when her child was a baby|`|qBFojHLMaa	I would not be in the least offended is someone asked me not to bring my son to the hospital to see their newborn, so I would say do whats comfortable. But eventually if you want to stay friends your going to have to accept the kids coming over if you want to see your friends. Good luck, and youve got almost a year before you have to worry about that, and thats if you got pregnant right now.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It's your baby and your decision. But just remember that to most moms their children are a part of them. You think he's "bad," but his mom loves him and may see it differently. Break it to her gently, but don't be surprised if she is offended. Once you are a mother, you will understand. I would be offended if someone asked me to leave my "bad" kids at home.|`|zwctZ812aa	We didn't have to ask anyone not to bring their kids around when my son was a newborn, I guess they just knew better, but if you think your friend would bring her two year old, just say that you're concerned about the baby not having his/her vaccinations yet and you would rather she leave the child at home if she comes to visit.  She shouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind if someone said that to me.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Never let a daycare or school aged child visit your newborn EVER|`|EMKuBql8aa	Just say, "we really don't want to expose the baby to germs so we want to keep the visitors to a minimum, I would love to have you only come though!"     They get the hint and polite all at the same time.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Just tell her you're not comfortable with it and you would rather the child stay home. You will have too much to do without trying to worry about her child too.  My fiance has a 3 year old nephew that is cute, but horrible. When my cat was still a kitten I let him hold her, and he ended up grabbing her by the neck, which he knows not to do because we'd been telling him. So ever since then I put her in our bedroom when he came over. My fiance's brother doesn't care about his kids, and I refuse to let them do whatever they want in my house.  I know a cat isn't the same as a child, but I was just giving you an example.

ANHsv4ENaa	Yes but we are trying to stop. We figure that as our son learns to talk it will be hard at first to keep him from saying anything he hears at home so we definitely don't want to curse in front of him! But as he gets older I think it is his own choice. I don't really believe in "bad" words but I do believe in offensive words. I will explain to him that he can curse if he wants to at home but out of respect for others when he is out in public it would be best not to.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I have improved greatly (a lot of conscience effort) but I can't say I'm perfect.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I have a 4 year old and a 6 month old.

I have learned to just watch what i say around my kids, if i don't and they start swearing i have only myself to blame.   I say this because my 7 year old at around 3 years old had some very choice vocabulary words and i didn't want her to have them anymore. I explained that i was wrong to say them and that she needs to not say them anymore too. All was well after that.  Of course at times i may slip up around them, but i always say whoops there goes mommies "adult" talk again and they laugh, but in the long run i'm hoping to not have teenage girls running around when i'm not around with potty mouths, i have 3 girls!   I understand what you are saying, and none of us are perfect.

Because both are just figuring out swearing (and starting to think it is cool) we take extra steps at home not to do it.  I try not to swear in front of them as even though you may not hear it, I assure you their teachers and friends are hearing your little ones potty mouth.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	"....Y!A is full of perfect mothers".  lol  That just made my day.  You're so funny.    I HATE cursing.  Its so crude and unintelligent.  Sometimes I just can't help it though.  It just slips out when I'm frustrated or in pain.  My husband and I try really, really, really hard not to curse around the children.  The other day, our 4 year old son dropped something on the floor and without hesitation said, "Damn it!".  Although there are far worse things he could be saying, its obviously not an appropriate response from a 4 year old.  Guess where he learned it though.  *points to self*  If I don't want them saying those words, then I need to not use those words.  Its really as simple as that.  After several discussions about how those aren't nice words and no one in the house should be using them (including Mommy and Daddy), he now scolds us if he catches us saying something naughty  It seems like we're all doing better now.|`|9e362da026600c90bb20cbf82c4b281aaa	no i dont think it is good ...children do often lead by example....|`|DcLXhtoLaa	I try not to but we do slip up once in awhile. the important thing is that if you do slip... and most of us do,  to appologize for saying the bad word and say it wasnt a good word and that you shouldnt have used it. This will also teach your children that its ok to not be perfect and to admit when your not.|`|3oUTLTOYaa	No, and if you do they will be more prone to not want to bind with you and try to reject you so don't|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	yes i cuss. it is my right as an adult and sometimes i just want to be "immature", although i did cuss behind my mom's back as a teen.  my kids are 8 and almost 11 years old. they know better than  to use those words. i am not one of the perfect moms thank God i wouldn't want that lie on me 24/7 but i am a darn good mom who raises my children very well but if i stub my toe or bash my head on a corner you won't hear "oh fudge sickle"  but you will hear something  worse. i do keep myself from using certain words around them though and i never have allowed anyone to use GD in my home. i will not say anything in say your house about it because it isn't my place but it isn't allowed in mine. funny though how you're automatically judged as a bad mom if you cuss. oh well it all comes down to how you feel about your parenting skills.|`|AA12243380	I try not to because my girls copy us and they're almost 20 months old and a tad young to understand bad words.|`|w0BfmqlQaa	Just remember your kids learn from you, they look up to you and therefore role Model you.  Yes I do use bad language around my children and now regret that because of my teenage son.  He has a very foul mouth amongst his peers and on occasion will let it slip at home.  Or he will use an abbreviated word like FRIGGIN on a regular basis and it is very embarrassing.  If I ever mistakenly swear out of anger towards him, he will get very offended and show less respect for me.  My youngest son does not swear but he is offended when people do around him and this makes him uncomfortable.  My kids are very different from one another and are affected differently.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well you need to consider the reality & fact that whatever you CHOOSE to do, say and who you BECOME when you are around your children is WHO THEY WILL BE, say and become too.  It's just a FACT - they DO WHAT YOU DO far more than they do what you say as a parent. YOUR EXAMPLE for good or bad, is what they base the foundation of their entire character upon.  And take a step BACK here and consider that if you don't want your kids to curse then the ONLY way to avoid it is to control yourself and not curse yourself.  DOES this mean they will then NEVER CURSE?  Well... probably not because they will hear it other places too.  BUT you can't play the hypocrite with your kids - none of us can .       YOUR home & family is your kids fundamental building blocks for his WHOLE life.  YOU have to set the example, the standard, the ground rules, the base line for morality, truth, right, goodness, kindness, love, healthy living, and every other habit, communication skill, relationship tone and measurement that you  HOPE he brings to his own life - he'll decide those things for himself or herself based on WHAT HE SAW and lived in your home.  SO you have to decide where you HOPE to set those standards for HIS future and act accordingly - we all do.  TOO FEW do so honorably enough.    I TRY not to swear around my kids - on occasion I admit or confess I slip and get overtly angry and say something I shouldn't.  THEY know I'm not perfect but they also KNOW I expect them to behave in a certain way - as imperfectly as they no doubt will too.|`|AA10167940	Yes, occasionally.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I try not to.  But, then again, I try not to when I'm not in front of the children, too.      When the kids do hear us curse, they know that we know that those are not nice, polite, respectful words to use and that we know that we shouldn't use them - we just made a mistake.  We know that when, occasionally, they use them, they are making the same mistake.
vue9NOhYaa	It depends on the baby.  Many babies this age are ready to eat table foods -- so you just cut up some of what you're making for the rest of the family, and offer it on his tray.  He picks it up and self feeds.  As long as the food is soft enough to gum up, he can eat it. (No teeth needed.)  Other babies still need purees, so you can offer any babyfoods (or home pureed foods, or naturally  'spoonable' things like yogurt or mashed potatoes) that you enjoy feeding and he enjoys eating.    At this age his milk is still the bulk of his diet, so if he's gaining slowly, better to encourage more breastmilk/formula (which contains lots of fat and good nutrients) and go easy on the solids.  Solids that DO have a lot of fat include avocado, whole-milk yogurt, meat, cheese, and so on.  But be careful. Babies tend to 'know' how many calories they need, and if you offer a baby lot of high calorie foods, he's likely to just eat less.  Being small isn't necessarily anything to worry about. Some babies just naturally weigh less than other babies (which is why we have 'growth charts', NOT single weight requirements), and if he's meant to be small, you won't accomplish anything by pushing more calories.|`|Jswomud7aa	8am- cereal, oatmeal (like peaches and cream mmm mmm), or fruit  10am- 8 oz bottle, usually takes about 30 mins to finish completely  12pm- babyfood: veggie or a dinner meal with a sippy cup of juice  2pm- 8 oz bottle  4pm- snack: cherrios usually, or other like cereal  5pm- dinner  6:30- 8 oz bottle  8:00- 8 oz bottle|`|l79QIWszaa	Feeding baby is so much fun!  Around this time is when you can decide whether your baby is ready to chew (gum) little pieces of food.  I make regular meals, like lasagna and other hot dishes, and puree them well, but leave chunks.  My babe loves this.    To help your kiddo gain weight, continue to mix DHA & ARA enhanced rice cereal with it's food for extra (good) calories.  Continue using formula, unless your doctor recommends starting whole milk.  As a pedatric RN, I recommend continuing formula if your baby is underweight and maybe even asking your physician about a formula that contains more calories (26cal instead of 24cal).    Hope this helps!

Im so sorry you are going through this.|`|gjAZeRyfaa	I think it is a great idea to speak with your pediatrician, let them  know you have chosen them as a person who you trust.  You  may also try bringing up the topic with your mom, perhaps  casually ask her about diet and giving up certain things for   health, this may lead to asking if she ever wanted to quit drinking.  Giving up alcohol has to be her decision, if she is ever to be  successful at quitting.    Try not to be judgmental but more concerned out of love.    God Bless, I will pray for you and your mom|`|I1eNscocaa	yes you can talk about it with the doctor and they will probibly know some places to go to get help for you mum. their are drinking help groups and rehab that she can go to. ask if their are any in your area. your mum needs help and you are very mature to go looking for ways to help her. good on you. just a thought, if your dad hates his wife being a drunk and really is true about helping her then why does he let her have enough money to get the drinks? cant he on his pay day withdrall his money and keep only abit left in the account for your mother so she hasnt enough money to go overboared buying drinks! their must be some way to limit her getting the drink. thats something you may want to have a little talk about with your dad and bro.
4cprznZcaa	during my first trimester i ate flaming hot cheetos and sour candies like: sour skittles and air head belts non stop, its the only thing i could keep down! i also wanted to be healthy so i decided to stop eatting that junk and eat healthier, and i learned that you can just flat out stop eatting things especially if you are craving it, eat what you want in moderation! i still enjoy candy but i limit how much i eat. also my biggest craving in my second and third trimester was pineapple, oranges and apples! try eatting fruit, its sweet and good for you! good luck on your pregnancy!|`|Jswomud7aa	Complex sugars in fruits and berries.

However, a pain in the rib is different you should check with your Dr.|`|E9dGOVs0aa	i would take tylenol before i drank wine. they say it is ok to drink wine in pregnancy but i dont believe them and i wouldnt and havent so far with this pregnancy. im 39 weeks. i did have a couple of glasses with my first though and she is 7 years old and perfectly fine but for some reason im scared to with this one. good luck!|`|mZjdxuweaa	Yes call your doctor drinking never helps anything especially  if your prego. You have made it so fare with out drinking don't stare now, You doctor may tell you to take tylenol pm or something... Drinking even in you 3rd trimester is still a risk if you ask me..|`|7HxJvbjMaa	One glass of wine at 38 weeks probably won't harm the baby, but I doubt if it will ease your rib pain either. The baby is big at this stage and your going to have some uncomfortable feelings, sounds like he is up under your ribs.  I would opt for a warm bath and a massage rather than the wine though. Good luck, hun!|`|MtC3CWZraa	Yes you should call your doc, and you shouldn't take anything that your doc doesn't suggest.|`|sB27kehMaa	Yes, call your doctor.|`|miPubuDYaa	Don't drink the wine. If you havent had a drink this whole time, why start now.     Call your doctor and tell him your pain. If anything go to the hospital. No way of finding if your in labour if you don't call. It could also be your baby is pushing on your ribs because he's uncomfortable inside.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	The baby can push against your ribs, it's very uncomfortable. i didn't sleep for two days straight before labor. You could probably go into labor anytime now. You should call and ask your doctor about the wine. you can take tylenol while pregnant , maybe it'll help. Maybe your doctor could induce you and then you could sleep after the baby is born.lol. good luck!
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    What it may be is the anxiety that you've been diagnosed with.  When people are stressed or worried, then it can stop their period or cause irregular periods with cramps.    It may also possibly been pregnancy, that will explain the sore boobs, sickness and backache, i had these symptoms very early on in my first pregnancy.    I would take a test in a week or so or have a blood test done by the doctors to confirm this, if your not pregnant i would get the doctors to check and see whats causing all this to happen. Best of luck  xx
gga2mwFIaa	It could be braxton hicks contractions. I had them around 34 weeks with my daughter and they lasted about 4 hrs I thought she was coming early but walking got rid of them. Or it could just be your body getting ready for birth and the baby moving into position putting more pressure on you.|`|JsshzKM9aa	As long as you're not bleeding and the pain is bareable, you are absolutely fine. Body is still making lots of changes for baby. 6 more weeks, the baby still has growing to do so your stomach/uterus is probably just stretching. Its all normal. :) congrats.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Menstrual-like cramps that late in pregnancy are usually a sign of labor.

RPszYGXkaa	Well as often as I say I will wait until I am due, usually the curiosity gets the best of me, and I will start to test around 10 or 11 DPO.  My rationale is I may be one of the few women who can get a BFP really early (never works out though...).  Best wishes and if you don't mind the possibility of a false negative you could try now.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	you can test as soon as 5 days prior to your missed period.. i am also trying , i haven't had any luck yet but my fingers are crossed. its better if you wait till you have already missed your period.. Best of Luck....|`|wWkfASTNaa	I usually wait until at least 11 dpo, although sometimes I get antzy and I test way earlier than that! 8 DPO this time!|`|304ef3a00356e988a8cd661bcf96f680aa	You can test at 10 dpo, but it might not register.

WPI0Z47saa	I had that problem. You could be having an allergic reaction to something that you were fine with before since your hormones are taking over. In my case it was the same vitamin that I have been taking for quite sometime. About 2 months into my pregnancy I developed an allergic reaction to it. It started with my hands and feet being itchy and then break outs on my neck, arms and stomach. My ob/gyn told me to rub cortozone cream on it and it went away. You can only use 1% though while you are pregnant so read the lable. It did wonders. Hope this helps.|`|4AO2myzKaa	Sounds like it could be PUPPP, but that's not normally until late third tri:    http://dermatology.about.com/cs/pregnanc...|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I had that problem on my legs, your skin is more sensitive during pregnancy and it also becomes more dry.

Just apply lotion regularly, unscented so it doesnt irritate your skin more.|`|cdb2cfce20c19afdeb27847428f89b3eaa	SEE YOUR DOCTOR|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Buy the Aveeno oatmeal bath stuff that people use for poison ivy or chicken pox and try taking a bath with it everyday.  Also, use intensive moisturizing lotion all over your body a couple times a day.  Some people get really dry skin during pregnancy, but if it doesn't get better you may need to see a doctor regardless if you have insurance or not.  You have to be very safe when you are pregnant, no matter the cost.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	I was the same way!!! I don't know what to tell you, lotion and stuff doesn't really help...

You will get billed, but they will work with you to make payments and such. You just don't it to turn out to be something more and possibly a threat to your unborn. It's so much better to be safe! Good luck and congrats!|`|l79QIWszaa	I had this very same problem!  But not until I near the very end of my pregnancy.  If your skin is red, inflamed, or has spots of red (like hives) make sure you see your doctor.    Go ahead and take an oatmeal shower and use some oatmeal lotion, like Aveeno.  They make products especially for pregnant mom's and you can find them online or at speciality stores (Motherhood Maternity has some, too).    If you are worried about not finding a doctor, get a hold of a public clinic or even planned parenthood and let the physician know what's up.    Good luck and hang in there!|`|goNi28Eraa	I would go apply for medicaid as soon as you can.  The good thing about medicaid is if you go to the doctor during your application pending, they will back-bill up to 3 months- assuming you get accepted.  Then make sure you go to the doctor!  You really need to get in for a prenatal appointment before your second trimester hits.  Good luck :)|`|AA10371609	I feel ya sister!!!  I've been itchy since about that time and I'm now at 18 1/2 weeks.    During pregnancy, your skin can be a little more sensitive to detergents, soaps, etc...  You may be experiencing an allergic reaction of some kind.  But on the other hand, your skin is a little dryer during pregnancy.      I find that using some kind of "calming lotion" helps.  Aveno makes a great lotion for irritated skin.  Look for anything that says "calms irritated skin" in the skincare aisle.  Every day, after you shower/bathe, slather it on.  Have your friend/boyfriend/husband put some on your back and keep a bottle of it handy for your hands and feet.      If it does not clear before your next appointment with your health care provider, ask them about it.|`|eP729T0Qaa	I have this same problem and I am about 10 weeks pregnant. My back and legs are ALWAYS itching. I attribute it to the skin stretching, but I don't really know why. When I mentioned it to my dr, she didn't seem concerned, just said to put lotion on it. But I completely understand, I make my husband scratch my back all the time!|`|ubbj3VOuaa	Get some benadryl.  You could be developing an allergy to something you ate or soap, detergent, etc.  Benadryl is safe.  Take one every 6 hours (or further apart if the itching isn't that bad).      Get yourself to your local Medicaid office to get you and that baby some health insurance.  It'll cover you throughout the pregnancy and delivery and will cover the baby until it's 5 years old including all well baby shots and visits.  It's worth it.
57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	Try the Marmet technique- it's a little bit different than you might think, but once you get the hang of it it's pretty effective.  The link below is the best illustrated guide I've found.|`|8t8NjjnVaa	You may be trying to express it more from the nipple instead of the areola.      The easiest way is to put your pointer finger and thumb into the shape of a C.  Put your thumb and pointer on the line where the areola (the dark area around your nipple) and your regular skin color connect.  Push in towards your chest slightly, then compress your fingers, and then pull away from your chest.      I could hand express fine with these instructions, but I preferred a pump though.
6UmRmaeWaa	I really hate to say this but...BE THANKFUL!     There are a lot of babies that will never go back to their own beds! You will wake up and have 5 year olds still trying to cram in your bed every night. Although it is sad beacuse nothing is sweeter than snuggling up with your baby it is routine and baby must feel nice and safe in the crib. Sounds like your doing an awesome job mommy!|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I had something similar.  When laying my daughter down for naps I used to hold her close and rock her, but she stopped letting me do that  when she was a few months old.  It is kind of sad, but they like to stretch out just like we do.|`|XKfrNzhUaa	i think its cute that it makes you sad... most moms would be thrilled to have their babies sleep on their own like that. just think.. the crib is the safest place for your baby and you dont have to break the habbit of your child sleeping with you as she gets older. your really lucky!!!|`|0ILy1p3taa	As a mom who co sleeps with both children, I see this as a blessing and understand the heartache!  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE sleeping with my kids, but I can't wait until they are out of the bed - even if they do come in in the middle of the night sometimes.  It was different for us though, my kids wouldn't sleep very well in cribs or bassinets and it made breastfeeding while sleeping WAY easier!    Enjoy the times when she lets you cuddle with her, then enjoy the times that you have your bed to yourself.|`|PkWX9Ouwaa	I know you want to cuddle with your baby but you should be glad that she wants to sleep in the crib.  There is always a chance of suffocation when you are sleeping together.  Our lamaze teacher said they have a couple of babies die that way every year.  Also you will be thankful later that you don't have to wean her off the habit.|`|zcAn3Mg8aa	Please do not be sad, be glad your baby feels secure in her own bed and likes to sleep there. It is truly the safest place for your baby to sleep.  There are many studies done on co-sleeping, some say it is great and safe others say it is unsafe because the baby could become smothered.  I have done both with each child and I believe they are better off in their own beds.  Good Luck and Sweet Baby Dreams.|`|28ZCfGWIaa	I know it's sad but I suggest you let her sleep in her crib. When she's older you'll thank yourself. :)
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    I'm not too sure why your testosterone levels are messing you around, maybe its just your hormones messing about.  I've never heard of this before, but i don't understand why the doctor won't look into testing you for PCOS as this can be dangerous, my best friend has it, and when they done an ultrasound on her she had cysts that were big on her ovaries and had to take medication to lower there size and help her ovulate.  After two cycles of being on clomid she fell pregnant and is expecting a little boy in May.    I would try searching this in google, your probably find alot more information on there.  Sorry i can't be more help.  Best of luck xx
4DoXomHZaa	Yes.    However, some women do not produce the pregnancy hormone quickly and may get negatives for some time. A tiny % of women never excrete it into the urine, only the blood.|`|0pmYRlMcaa	Yes, but you need to take it first thing in the morning to get enough concentrated hcg.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Go for it, the test should be very accurate by now. I took mine the actual day i missed my period (was due) and got a BFP!!  So i'm sure you'll have something by now!  Good luck!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	they are reasonably accurate from 14 dpo yes. Dont be discouraged if it's negative though, so long as af stays away you keep testing every 2 days. Use first morning urine though as 14 dpo is still very early.  best of luck honey! let us know! fingers crossed|`|gwuTKiNXaa	it should be|`|tbZNMfAsaa	Sometimes. You may have to wait about a week or more. Your body would need to build up enough of the hormone that the HPT detects. Everyone is different just like every pregnancy is different
FnN9vwmwaa	she to little to copy anything even draw a circle....  when she draws and tells u it a car or a doll it ok even if it doesnt look like it it her imagination this is really important during the developing of a child never put her drawings down always make her feel good about them....also always give her blank paper never buy her the coloring books cuz it makes her lose her imagination and never tell her what color to use let her be free....and if she cant grasp the pencil the corect way is because her gross motr skill on her hands are developing give her time|`|2wrEoTYgaa	Well my daughter is 2 right now. And she can write her name (although some letters are backwards and very sloppy). She can also sing the tune of her abc's (but only knows A-B-C).  But when she draws she mostly scribbles, so i give her the colouring books. She trys to stay in the lines but isnt very good at it now.     Oh and she does the full hand grasp too|`|28ZCfGWIaa	All children develop differently. My daughter didn't draw a good complete circle til she was almost 3, she mostly scribbled. Although she held her utensil properly and she also colored very well and did her best to stay in the lines.  She is almost 4 now and can write about 10 different letters, stick people, faces and a few shapes.|`|cypZ0ykXaa	no, she cant copy letters so soon.she's doing very fine.kids of her age can only hold the pencil & scribble.thatz it.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	That's how my son draws.  He starts with scribbles then sometimes he'll just draw huge circles.  But, that sounds about right.  I think 2 is a little young to be copying letters, but I am not saying it's impossible.  Mostly it seems they are interested that they are able to make "pictures"  they are discovering what their hands can do with a crayon, pencil, pen...ect.|`|woRKEU3yaa	the just love to scribble its about the only thing they can do at that age|`|DcLXhtoLaa	That sounds about normal fot a 2 year old. the praise is good because it gives the child encouragement to keep drawing and that will giver her practice developing her fine moter skills.
DuLhv7Ajaa	As a mom of three, I've found that a simple baby food mill is the easiest and healthiest way to go. Of course it must be age appropriate food, their tummies can't handle large quantities of meat proteins, but you can grind up all sorts of fruits, veggies, and grains. Say you bake a sweet potato, you can put it through the baby mill add a little formula or breast milk, a small amount of rice cereal, and you baby has a nutritious meal. What you eat they can eat, with in reason. Its really not that hard and you can start you kid on a life long love affair with veggies.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I second Sophie's mommy's answer. I used that website as well. They give you recipes and tell you hpw to make all kines of purees, like if you need to steam the food first.|`|siDcjgJCaa	This is the greatest website for baby food. I use it all the time. I made made my own and it was WAY cheaper than jarred food....     http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/    IT has the process of making the food, what to start on,and the food charts are really helpful.... Making your own is really easy.|`|EsDg4Kbgaa	Get fresh vegetables and fruit a smash them in a bowl real good (with a little bit of water) or put them in a blender.    Feeding fresh and natural food might actually be better...|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Check out the website Wholesome Baby Food--or something like that.  They have excellent guides on starting solids and making baby food.  If you wanted to spend the money, I have the book "100 Baby Purees" which I think has a lot of useful information and recipes.  Plus, it gives you suggestions on moving on from what they have in the book.|`|Lgo6UX12aa	At Babies R Us there is a little food processor that cost 10 bucks. I would slice up bananas and puree them, avocados, cooked carrots, cooked sweet potatoes. It was so easy and fantastic! I loved it! DD is on table foods now though. There are lots of websites out there that tell you how to make everything! Forget books - they are expensive - the internet is free!! ;)    Good luck!

Then I'd never use that.    I've always liked Jocelyn for some reason, and the nickname Joss.  Anna is simple and nice, but I personally would never use it, too common.  Michaela I used to like as a kid, but I know people with the name over time, and lost interest in the name.  Angela I've grown to like, maybe I'd use it or Angel as a middle name.  Cassidy's ok, but I wouldn't use it.  I wouldn't use Natalie.  I would never use Danielle.  Carmen's not my style.  Zoey, I like, but think of Sesame Street.  Isabelle is so overused.|`|8mchLCQhaa	I like Cassidy     I would never use any of the other names|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I like Mikaela and Carmen. I probably wouldn't use the rest.

EaWhmRaJaa	Terrible twos unfortunately! She's at that age wher she's learning things r suddenly not goin her way (as a baby if they r praised 4 burping, playing n acting cute - when they reach 2 they learn burping is rude, they must use th toilet, behave more, share, etc, etc) it's a difficult age cuz they jus dont understand how dramatic th change is from baby to toddler.     She's trying to understand the world n presumes al these rules, social etiquettes n new/different behaviours r an indication on her own wrong doing. She thinks that she is suddenly naughty or bad n which is why she is saying everyone hates me. It makes perfect sense if u think about it - wen she was a baby u wud probly pick up a toy that she thrown on th floor n giv it her back only 4her 2 drop it again n wud keep engaging in her game, now u wud probly tell her 2 pick something up if she threw it on th floor. Wen u burp a baby u prasie them n say good girl or well done wheras now u'd say don't do that it's rude. Imagine how u wud feel if u did everythin u usually do n then 2 b constantly told no that's wrong or that's bad.    My only advise is to jus stick it thru, wen her understanding progresses u will certainly c less of this.But watever u do DON'T lack in discipline! U may empathise n feel bad 4 teeling her off or disciplining her 4 being naughty but it's essential! Time outs work better as they won't harm or hurt her n ives her time to reflect n calm down. As for in public, jus tell her u can't hear her unless she stops crying n u wont talk to her if she carries on as she wont b able to hear u - trust me it works, even if it takes a good ten min of screamin bloody murder!! Then talk 2 her in words she understands, explaining u r not being nasty but she is getting 2 b a big girl now. Reward her with things 4 wen she resists tantrums (remember not 2 buy or bribe her tho!)    As for th cuddles, it's normal - she knos they r ther n can b cuddled wenever so wait 4 her 2 allow u 2. If u stop asking or wanting cuddles she will definately come running 4 them!! This is jus a sign that she is aware of how loved she is n is testing u!    Last note - she sounds perfectly normal n so don't fret!! Every mum goes thru this!!    Best wishes! x|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	hmmm she certinaly has you wrapped round her little finger! My daughter also says this exact same phrase! though she is slightly older at 5 and all she watches is cbeebies on the tv (maybe we should watch these programmes a little closer!)  At first i felt bad and she got what she wanted, now I know its a ply for what she wants so I give it no attention I just say back to her, mummy and daddy love you very much but prefer not to talk to you when your being naughty like this... dont know if its helping or not as its still a favourite phase of hers but it certinaly isnt getting her anywhere|`|izbAdDUraa	My son comes up with the craziest stuff, but in that same aspect he heard it from SOMEWHERE somehow. He just normally mixes them together into something jumbled that makes no sense! I chock it up to his being a boy and having a vivid imagination. BUT with that said, if this continues (and it sounds like this is a problem, if you cant even get close to her at times) you should talk to a doctor, or psychiatrist. I know that sounds scary, but she could have had a really traumatic experience, whatever it may have been. Or it could just be her imagination! Since you don't know for sure, i would air on the cautious side and talk to your doctor. :]|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	A 2 year old  doesn't just say something like that - she heard it somewhere...more than likely at school or on TV.  Sometimes those kids shows do the "what would you do if..." type situations and it plants ideas in their heads.  She is 2 years old - she is beginning to pull away and become her own independent person and this is scary.  They get overwhelmed and don't know how to control their emotions, so out come the fits and tears.  She could also be reacting to your emotional state at the moment (sorry for your loss, by the way) and could be feeling a bit smothered but doesn't know what to do about it.  I wouldn't worry about what she said & I seriously doubt she truly feels that way - she's too young to understand what that phrase means and was parroting something she heard.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My 3 year old does the crocodile tears and says 'daddy doesn't love me anymore', when he has told her off. And she does it the other way round if I tell her off!  They pick up the funniest things, I honestly wouldn't worry about it.|`|AA11349925	She was just having a hissy fit and said the first thing that came in to her head, last thing you want to do is pay attention to it!   If she does it again, walk away (or if your out take her home) and ignore it. If you give it too much attntion she will earn to use it to get her own way,
gx4s68s8aa	It is very possible that they put it in the wrong spot in your spine.  Especially if you felt comfortable for a short time and then the pain came back.  If they put it in the wrong spot, then you would get pain relief from the shot that numbs your back, but not from the actual epidural.  However, that numbing shot feels much the same way as the epidural at first, so you could have not know it wasn't in properly.    With my induction, when they did the first epidural it was place incorrectly.  At first I thought I was numb and then about 20 minutes later, they tried to put in the foley catheter and that hurt so much.  Then they tried to check me for dilation and that was very painful.  So at that point I knew something was wrong.  They realized it was in the wrong spot.  They did it again and all was well.    They later said that epidurals can go in the wrong spot especially if you are very skinny or a very large woman.  With both cases it is extra difficult to put in the epidural.     So I don't know if this is what happened to you, but it might have.|`|FplTPoAyaa	My epidural did not work with my first baby.  It was a nightmare.  The second time around, the epidural worked, and WOW....what a difference !! I waited too long the first time....so, my advice to all expectant mothers is not to be afarid to ask for pain medication if you have chosen to go that route !|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	Ohh, that kind of scares me! I hope it works on me :o( I'm having twins and I'm so scared!!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Yes, it doesn't work all the time. It's not that it doesn't work on "some people" or that it was necessarily placed incorrectly. It could be the labor itself - did your labor progress rapidly? Epidurals don't work as well for rapid labors.     The nature of the epidural space inside the outer layer of the spinal cord also affects the effectiveness of the medication. It's a free-floating space, and when they put in the catheter tube and remove the needle they cannot control where the tubing floats. Where it lands will affect where the medication flows to and how well it works. Sometimes the anesthesiologist can pull the tube back a few millimeters and it will reposition the tube and bring more relief. But not always.    I too had an epidural that didn't work. It was related to a rapid, induced labor. I wasn't a nurse then and didn't know there was a possibility it might not work. And I had no plan B for pain relief. So it's a good thing it went quickly.|`|miPubuDYaa	I believe that is true. I had an epidurals for my first child. It worked for the pain for the contractions However when i needed an emergancy c-section. They had to keep giving it to me because i was in so much pain, that i felt them cutting into me.    After the surgery. I shook uncontrolably for 12 hours. The nurses says i was coming off the epidurals.    I don't know if this is related but i had surgery another time and i was given morphine and that did not work at all either.|`|AA11049477	It didn't work for me either.  According to a friend of mine ( a medic ) it just goes like that sometimes.  It might work & then again it might not.  Not much help to a woman who wants it to work & it doesn't, any more than a woman desperate for it to wear off so she can pee without a catheter!|`|NUmeIxyfaa	They gave it to me in the middle of labor and it did not work. They said that because i have a tattoo on my lower back, that they must have not inserted the epi correctly. So as I was crying in pain they tried a second epi, but it was just too late. I began pushing probaby 20 minutes later and the only thing it did was make my legs numb.     I guess it is not for everyone!|`|5ViTUTyZaa	It did nothing for my labor pains at all.  I had back labor and it was extremely painful.  I can say it did not help the pains cuz I was having back labor before they gave me the eppy.  I know it did make me numb though cuz I ended up having a c-section.|`|GNXf60R1aa	I got one too when I had my little guy. It lasted for like a hour and a half, and that was it. When it came time to do the pushing, I couldn't even tell I had gotten one. I felt it all. I was really pissed too , that I had to pay for it when I didn't really get any use out of it.  I decided next time I have another baby, I will not get an epidural, cause I pretty much had my first one without it.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	My cousin, and a few of my friends swear by an epidural.  With me though, which I thought was worth having anyways, didn't work all the way...I felt better after the epidural, but I still felt the cramping and pressure down there, and after about 7 hours on the epidural, it wore off...it was freakin awful.  It is different for everybody though.  I have heard "our" stories, and I've heard it was the greatest thing ever...depends on the person.|`|wXtqKFf8aa	Nope, didn't work for me or any of my friends. Weird huh?  I hear people swear by it and thank God for it. BUT that's good for them. I didn't have a positive experince with it at all. And I will not get it done with time. I got mine in a 6cm, wore off by 9/10 then it completely fell out due to me doing squats on the bed to lower my son down into the birth canal. I felt every push, and pain. So basically I only had the epidural for the contractions, and not the actual birth itself.  So this time, I know I can get through it without it. I'm not going to be tied down to a bed for nothing again.|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	it works on most but sometimes if the doctor dosnt hit the right nerve in the back it wont work.but this rarely happens!!!if it does you could sew and get some $$$$$$ for the baby.lol|`|QoenvlFuaa	I have heard that it doesn't work for some women, but it worked perfectly for me. I was numb within 10-15 minutes and never felt anything for the next 24 hours or so (I got my epidural about 12 hours before I ended up with a C/S, and then kept it into the next day although they were gradually decreasing it). It is possible that it just doesn't work for you, or it is possible that they did it wrong. I'm not sure if there's really a way to tell.|`|Y6TSCciKaa	I asked my doctor about this because I was worried it wouldn't work on me. I was with my SIL when she gave birth to my godson and the epidural didn't work for her also caused her to have several small seizures, he told me it doesn't work for everyone so I'm keeping my fingering crossed!|`|4AEhBAMBaa	Some people an epidural does not work for.Mine did,but they messed my back up with it because the spaces in my back are paper thin.|`|E9dGOVs0aa	it worked with my first. only felt pressure at the end and i am praying it works with this one as well im 39 weeks and ready to go!|`|GBijP0Ddaa	With my son, the same thing happened.  I was in heaven at first, then I could feel some contraction then i yelled for more but by the time they came i was crowning!  So i felt everything!    But with my daughter it worked wonders, even though at the end i had to get a c-section.    I wonder what the outcome with this one is going to be.  I keep getting tough and say i wont take it then i watch the baby chanel and i'm like forget it!|`|o5jSID4Jaa	With my first 2 it worked amazingly. I felt no pain with contractions and only pressure when it came time to push. This time was totally different though. For the first part of labor I couldn't feel contractions but once I got to 9cm all pain came back. They kept telling me to push my button for extra dose but it did nothing at all for the pain! I'm not sure what happened and why it didn't work this last time...
S1gJJHNzaa	yes, i get that too... clomid always gives me early pregnancy symptoms, nice eh'.    then around 12dpo I get all bloated up so I can't even fit in my jeans, keeps getting better!    last clomid cycle, (cycle  2)  using only 50mg I developed a 9 cm cyst!  good times    so I'm waiting for the cyst to go away then going w/ clomid and IUI for three tries.    good luck and God bless you!|`|Ldvi6UPOaa	Yes its normal. I got that my first cycle of Clomid. I even had some spotting at 6 dpo which I swore was implantation bleeding, my breast were sore after ovulation,  and I had cramping too. Turned out that I wasn't pregnant. But hopefully you are getting pregnancy symptoms!!!!    I hope you get your BFP really soon!!!|`|FMTuvujXaa	Yes, I used to get all those feelings. It almost makes u feel that ur pregnant.ITs only ur first cycle of clomid, just wait n it gets better(Just like karma said). Saying that, it could work for you straight away too, my cousin was diagnosed with pcos and was put on provera  first to induce periods and then clomid and bham! she fell pregnant. And please be warned tat with this tablet there's a high risk of multiple pregnancy too. All the best and hope it works for you. It din work for me, i took it forever.
AIrCtDCYaa	You will be really crampy and tired and moody but if you stop tryin so hard it will happen. Baby Dust too you. I would see your doc and see what is wrong. Good Luck|`|oOBg9hshaa	you should consider getting ovulation predictor kits to pinpoint when u ovulate but then again if you have irregular periods you should see a doctor, it might be because you have pcos|`|f5pticCLaa	There are many signs to indicate you are ovulating. Physical symptoms of ovulation are breast tenderness, cramping of the abdomen, increased vaginal discharge and changes in cervical firmness and positioning. Another way to determine if you are ovulating is to measure your basal body temperature.
vue9NOhYaa	No, not possible.  The sperm couldn't live long enough to fertilize the egg that you release next cycle.|`|XyQgoSk1aa	most likely not as you usually ovulate 2 weeks be4. But it could happen everything is possible.|`|4DoXomHZaa	No. Your egg could not drop until two weeks later. Sperm only live 5 days at most inside the woman.    BUT!!! Unless you are absolutely sure when you ovulate (some women have unusual ovulation) DON'T do it unless you WANT a baby.     There's lots of great info online about a woman's cycle|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Highly unlikely, but possible.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	The answer to this is yes. While it would be unusual  it is possible.    Pregnancy occurs at the time of ovulation or within about 48 hours of the egg being released form the woman's ovary.     Obviously it is necessary for the egg to be fertilised by the man's sperm during the time it takes from being released to reaching the womb.     Generally, ovulation takes place about the middle of a woman's cycle, that is about day 14. But ovulation can occur sometimes very early or very late in the cycle.     Say your wife has a 28-day cycle counting from the first day of her period. She could have ovulated on day 24 - not that unusual  and the egg could have been still capable of fertilisation and implantation by day 26  two days before her next period was due to start.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Your question is really hard to read and understand.  I think you're asking if you can get pregnant if you have sex the day before your period.  If that's the case, yes.
73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	We  had the same issue & I'll tell you what worked - you do more than just ask if she has to go - you physically take her into the bathroom and sit her on the toilet every hour or two.  Eventually she'll come around - it just takes time.  Going poo is always harder for some reason than peeing in the toilet - almosts every child has an issue of it at some point, so you aren't alone.|`|xRiQUZt5aa	It sounds to me like your daughter is running the show and KNOWS it. Your line "we try to get her to sit on the toilet ... and she won't" is the clue. She's three years old. You're the adult. This control thing is the main problem you have to solve before the potty-training itself.    Here's what I'd recommend. First of all, have her wear Pull-ups. That way, she can get them up and down and if there is an accident, it's not a mess.    Secondly, inform her that it's time to go potty about every hour or so. Do whatever works - set a timer, make an announcement. Then put her on the potty. The first few times, she may fight you and refuse to sit, but if you kindly and patiently persist, then she'll see that her fighting you is useless. You need to get the upper hand here. Then after the first few times on the potty, which may require some fighting with her, I'd say something like, "Hey, do you want Mommy to pull down your Pull-Up, or do you want to do it?" That way, you're not giving her a choice on whether or not to sit on the potty, but you are giving her a feeling of some sort of control - which is what she wants. Whichever option she chooses, then, she's still going potty!     I've potty-trained three kids, and the rewards thing never worked with them. They couldn't have cared less. So you might want to try taking away the rewards aspect until she's a little more under control - only because it's obviously not working or enticing her, either!    The other option is that nasty, potty-train-in-one-day thing. Take her diaper off, gate her into your kitchen and let it run down her legs all day until she WANTS to sit on the potty. Personally, I always thought that was a cruel thing to do! But who knows?    Good luck with it!|`|GoWxD9Gmaa	Hummm When you say sit on the toilet do you mean   "Baby port a pottie" Cause some kids would rather go in a toilet better suited for their size. I would make a shopping trip just for her, have her pick out a baby port a pottie and set it down by the stairs where she is comfortable going.
pUnjP0Jyaa	wait to see how long it last or if it stops it could jsut be the beginning of your period and it may very well get darker in color you never know  however wait it out for like 5days than take another test using your first mornings urination it could be  too early for it too show up on an hpt if you are prego maybe try getting a blood test done its the most accurate|`|jD0F29FLaa	please have yourself checked out again     there are lots of different things going around in this world today and you can never be to careful.    today 29th january i took my domestic to have herself tested and her test came back positive for HIV    please all you guys out there have protected sex this HIV affects everyone and the sad-est part of it all is that its all us young people the so called next generation that is dying of all these different things out there.    o and the guy that gave it to her is someone that she has known for most of her life    SO PLEASE BE MORE CAREFUL AND GO SEE A DOCTOR AND CHECK FOR EVERY SICKNESS UNDER THE SUN
89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	yes a mother can give her rights over to anyone she wills even to the state for the child to be placed into foster care. make sure that you are 110% committed to your decision however, once you sign your rights over you are no longer in charge of how or where your child will be brought up. my mother gave my father full custody of me and my two brothers when we were young children, i never met her till i was 17. my father then gave full custody of me over to my grandparents when i was 16. so once you give up your rights over your child the person who gets custody now has the right to give that child over to someone else, its not a game its very serious and can have major effects on the child. my brother and his girlfriend gave their two children to the state when they were homeless and struggling, it took them over a year to get the children back and the whole time they had to pay the state child support. please be sure that you trust the father and know that your baby will be best off living with him, or you could also work something out with the courts so you get your baby every weekend or once a month for a week, ext.   be wise in your decision this is a newborn life you are dealing with and not a used car.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean the judge will let her out of paying child support to the father|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes she can but she better make sure that is what she wants because she cant change her mind later.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes she can give full custody to the father, but she would still be required to pay child support.  She cannot voluntarily give up her rights to the child unless a step-parent is willing to adopt it.|`|tmh42R6Caa	Yes.  Or she give give up full custody to the state.  If you don't feel you are a good fit for your child, you have every right to give it to someone who would be a better parent.  Many states even have a "no questions asked" policy.|`|04kOtcGgaa	yes
at9qW0gLaa	It could just normal swelling in pregnancy but you should probably call your doctor and let them know. I woke up with a swollen face for a few days and also noticed my hands and feet were huge. I called my doctor and was sent to labor and delivery to have my blood pressure monitored.  Everything turned out okay but now I am being closely watched for pre-eclampsia (swelling can be a sign of Pre-E)  Just let your doctor know so they can decide if they want to keep an extra eye on you.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	it sounds like it may be caused by water retention
7d632fbyaa	ABOUT 2-3 PUNDS. YOU HAVE 5 WEEKS LEFT?|`|dq04utMoaa	I am 33 weeks and I had a ultrasound done on Tuesday which said she was 4lbs and 8 ozs so I figured that if my has gained 17 ozs in 3 weeks she will gain another pound by the time I am 36 weeks and maybe yours will be like 2 more pounds 6 pounds and 4 ozs...you know ultrasounds can be off too...|`|HkRndSuqaa	I've heard lots of different things, but it really depends. The doctor kept telling me that I had a good sized baby coming and to be prepared, and she ended up being 6 lbs! Not a big baby by any means!
dd5d0f065b45c14a02d51f88fefe773eaa	This is my third!! I am very anxious b/c shortly after he is born my husband will deploy back to Iraq. My older kids will be 4 years and 22 months when this baby arrives!! I also have to have another c-section. My two previous pregnancies ended in c-sections. I am worried that the Army won't give my hubby enough time off and I might not be healed completely when he returns to work. Our house is a tri-level so I will have to either go upstairs or downstairs all day long!! SO I AM VERY NERVOUS!!!|`|khSCs1rbaa	Currently 26w 5d with no 2. My eldest is now 6 yo, he was borned 3 days before due date. I am a little anxious & worry since I had first one 6 yrs ago. My SIL has 4 boys & they arrived earlier than the last one.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I know it's my third child/pregnancy. My son (the 2nd one) was born at 20 weeks,so unfortunately there was nothing that could be done with it. Mine is in no way close,it's been almost 6 years since my daughter,and almost 4 since the last one. Just ty and calm down,and take it easy! Good luck!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	this is my first     being my first i am completely scared and anxious.    i do not know what to expect.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	This is my first and second child.  I have heard though that labor does usually get easier and quicker with each child.  Your muscles have already been stretched and relaxed, so you probably won't feel as much pain afterward.  Good luck!|`|AA10315542	I am currently 9 weeks pregnant.  I have had one ectopic and 2 miscaarriages, but technically this is my first if I carry him/her to term.|`|MqFeJiukaa	Well this is my 5th.  My first 2 are 15m apart and they are now 9 and 10, my 3rd is 4 1/2 and my youngest just turned 1 last Friday and I am 36 weeks.  Every labor is different.  With my first 2 I didn't get an epidural.  With my 3rd I got the epidural right away so I didn't feel any painful contractions with him.  However he was "sunny side up" so he was very difficult for me to push out but that may of been from the epidural.  My youngest I also had an epidural and I had a lot of prob with pushing but she was my biggest baby at 8lbs 7oz.  I decided this time I am avoiding an epidural.  I think it gets easier in part because you know what to expect.  My 2nd was the easiest to deliver because I knew what the contractions felt like, they were still fresh in my mind so I just really focused on a spot on the ceiling (it looked like snoopy) and did my breathing.  I only had active labor for 4hrs.  Best of Luck and Congrats!|`|HXQybdEdaa	This is my first, and I'm deadly excited!  I'm hoping everything will work out, and I've got it decided, I'm not going to find out the gender until it's born!   I'm not anxious at the moment, but as I'm still in my first trimester, it probably hasn't hit me yet.   It will soon.    Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|rXMSK2B6aa	I am pregnant with my 1st and 2nd right now, I am super nervous about the birth of my babies.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	I just had my third 3 weeks ago and I felt the same as you. I'm not sure why but I was so nervous about everything this time around. Everything turned out fine tho. Went into labor at 37 weeks. It only lasted for 5 hours total! I'm sure yours will be fine as well. Good luck and congrats on baby  3!|`|yCWXrkPuaa	I am 7 weeks pregnant with my third.  I am very scared and nervous.  I have a 13 yr old and an 11 yr old.   I assume  I am terrified this time around because it has been 11 years since the last time I was pregnant, and also, I'm 38 yrs old......not as young as I was for the last two.  I"m glad to hear I'm not the only one nervous about having another baby.
uTsTreLMaa	Here is what worked for me - we agreed upon a date in the future to start ttc.  For us it was about two years out.  During that time we both made changes to get ourselves ready.  I stopped travelling for business, made sure I had good insurance, we took a couple of vacations that would not have been possible with a child and my husband got comfortable with the idea of being a father.  My friends said he would not honor the commitment, but I believed he would.  Sure enough, when the time came it was really nice.  We had a romantic evening, shared a bottle of wine and conceived on the first try.  Our son is now 2 & 1/2 months old and my husband has been a good partner to me throughout.  In retrospect, even though I was ready 2 years ago, I am glad to have had the extra time to prepare as well.  Even when you want a child, it is a huge life changing event.|`|FlRfStEgaa	I am trying to get my husband to have one last baby.  He is feeling the same way.  I think I just need to let it take it's course.  You don't want him to be resentful if he is not truly ready.  But reassure him that the finances are okay.  Go over the bank account with him and the bills.  Try to save even more.  That might show him how much this means and how serious you are about the situation and his feelings.  Good luck to you!!!!|`|LXe08bn8aa	My husband was the exact same way. He wanted kids but the idea of being a father and having all this responsibility scared him a bit. I basically reminded him that once we got pregnant, it would still be another 9 (almost 10!) months before baby actually arrived.   I also noticed that whenever we talked about having kids, all I was portraying was excitement and eagerness. We had one conversation where I told him that while yes, I was excited, the idea of being a parent also scared me to death but was still something I really wanted. This seemed to kinda comfort him to know that he wasn't the only one in the relationship who was nervous about it.  No matter what though, just make sure that when you start trying, that you both are on board! My husband and I are now 7 months pregnant and it's it so nice to have him there beside me, excited about all the little things the baby is "doing" this week. When you both are wanting it, the experience is amazing and definitely worth any wait!!  Good luck and tell your hubby he's not alone haha :)
s5l6D5Sfaa	I feel you!  I do the same thing.  It's so hard not to get discouraged.  And when other people say not to think about it and it will happen, I get even more discouraged.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to not think about getting pregnant when it's the only thing I want?  Baby dust to you!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	i feel the same way. you are not alone. you have to believe it will happen for you - and dont feel foolish its natural to hope for something you want so badly.   i am in the same boat. keep hoping against hope that it will happen for me and almost have myself believing it and then the damn hpt wont cooperate.    chin up - keep going. we will get there. hugs x|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. I know how your feeling right now. Just hang in there! Im sending you TONS AND TONS AND TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!|`|PPsMTNpEaa	I know how you feel i been feeling like that for a few weeks already and I am scared to test and find out i am not...My prayers go to you because i know what u are going through best of luck and hope you get blessed with a babu soon....just like i hope i do too....|`|QB5D0rG4aa	I know how you feel. Me and my husband have been trying for awhile and i always think that I may be pregnant and end up getting my period a few days later. I hope it works out for you next time. baby dust.|`|9GuqdXa2aa	AAAAHH.... me too. I'm 13dpo, BFN 10dpo. I'm disappointed that I'm not pregnant, and that I let myself get convinced this was the month. On the other hand, I'm still hoping for a miraculous BFP on Sat. Sometimes we want something so bad that is does affect how our body feels. Your persistence in ttc will pay off, with everything modern medicine can do for ttc's- there is so much hope, never give up!!|`|pofQofLqaa	I feel your pain. I've been trying for 2 1/2 years. It gets old! Its going to be worth all of this though. Thats what gets me through the day! There have times too though that I have experienced symptoms that would lead one to believe they might be pregnant. Sometimes I think we can create them, but other times, we may really experience them. Who knows. Its time though, I believe to feel the real thing!!! I hope you get pregnant soon!!
AOfm8ey6aa	If your period has been always regular and now is 5 days late, pregnancy test is negative, I say its PROBABLY caused by some stress. I would recommend to wait few more days and re-do the test. If it comes negative again, then I would say you are not pregnant and you are experiencing a late period for some other reason. Of course, getting checked by a gynecologist is the only way you will find out for 100%. He can also give you some advice about how to help you to get your period regular.|`|dZtToTIbaa	Have you been stressed lately? Any diet changes? Excessive exercise?  Any of those can cause a missed/late period.  If you haven't started in another week or so then take another test and if still negative go to the doctor.|`|236dff262dfe803c6fd1705a0e3caffaaa	Try and wait another week to see if your period comes and then take another test to be sure.|`|lCwjDDcoaa	They could be negative 2 in a row, Try to do it with your first morning urination. Also, I know personally I had skipped my period because of stess, Differnt medications, diets, Exersize can mess with your period as well.  If all else fails, Check with your Dr if you don't get in another week
eBKJRmEgaa	It depends how foreign they sound. Juanita, Guadalupe, Ricardo, Alejandro.. etc. sound very Spanish, whereas names like Maria, Antonia, Calista, Gabriela.. etc would be fine, there wouldn't be pronunciation issues there.    Personally, I think it's fine to use a 'foreign' name. After all, everything is foreign in English. Why should we have to stick to certain names that have arbitrarily become popular over time?    As for Isabella Grace, it is a *very* popular combination, although I don't think the use of the name Grace is a problem. It's no different to an English person naming their child Elizabeth Gracia.|`|GKJEgidzaa	No, I think that is a stupid thing to say. My parents gave me a Russian name, we live in the Uk, I would be upset if i didn't have a name which showed my heritage. Who wants to be called Kirsty or Jane when you can be called some unusual and exotic.|`|MLLCn4weaa	Isabella is a Spanish name.  I love the boys names.  I don't they'll be a hinderance to them.  When they have their own friends at school - they're hardly likely to speak slowly to them.|`|UzkHnXzVaa	No, I don't think it's wrong. Why should you be forced to limit what your choices on names could be simply because of where you live? My spanish teacher was born and raised in South America and his parents named him Eric. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. As long as the parents like the name, I think it's fine.     Why should they have to give him a name that 5 other kids in his class will have?     Also, I think Isabella sounds nice with Valentin and Quique. Isabella is Italian, but Italian and Spanish are similar so I think it still goes together quite nicely. Isabel is the Spanish form of the name, and it's extremely similar to Isabella so either way...    And no, you would not be right to tell them to choose something more spanish. Sorry, but it's their decision only, not yours.|`|okgr5aPCaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with calling their kids names from their native land at all.  People may think they are Spanish speaking at first but obviously when they have met them and spoken to them they will realise they speak English.   As to people speaking slow to them when they hear their name, that's just ignorant but it;s not a problem, we can just laugh at those people for their stupidity, and when they realise they are English it won't be a problem.      I don't think it is your business to interfere with what they want to name their baby at all. It's not your place to try and put them off of calling their little girl wat they want to call her.    The name Isabella is an Italian name so I'm not sure why they have chosen it, but the Italian and Spanish languages are very similar and so I guess the name is Spanish sounding.    I think its a lovely name and you should just leave this poor couple to it, it isn't your decision to make and I don't think you should do anything to change their mind. It's obviously a name they like.      The name you choose for your baby shouldn't be a name that fits in with the place you live, thats just a stupid idea.  I'm picky with names and have a list of names that I like, and becaise I'm English, they are names that are pretty English and popular in England, as I obviously have 'English' taste...   But if I were to move to say Spain and have children there, I would still call my children the names I like. I wouldn't suddenly think ' oh they need to have Spanish names because they live in Spain.   People should name their children names they like, not names that are popular in the place they live, or names that the strangers around them have.      p.s - quique is indeed a spanish name, but valentin is of latin origin, so there is no need to call their third baby a spanish name, or valentin would be the odd one out if we are saying they should all have names from the same origin.  with isabella they would have spanish, latin and italian, a nice variation of exotic names rather than being boring and using all english or all spanish.|`|nuLF8SqBaa	yes i do i know how it feels|`|aZ2clyDqaa	My whole family have portuguese names and quite a few of us live in england. Me and my brother speak english with an english accent and most people presume we're british despite our names.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Is it wrong for them to choose a name that doesn't 'mesh' with where they are currently living?  No its not wrong.  Why would it be?  Its ignorant to think that you should only name your children a name that fits into the community that you currently live in.    Would it be right of you to TELL them to choose something else for their daughter?  No, it wouldn't.  It is there child and they can name the child whatever they want.  If they ask for your opinion, then you can give it.  Other than that though, its really none of your business.    Isabella is Italian.  By your way of thinking, they should move to Italy if they want to use that name.  See how silly that whole idea sounds?|`|QzBgeyKeaa	All of there names should match I guess , like Use Isabella , and a really spanch name|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	Juan|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Well, Isabella is an Italian name and is commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries. It doesn't seem to me that they're trying to use a name that "sounds less Spanish" to me. Also, please keep in mind that this is their daughter, not yours, and criticism regarding how "Spanish" the name of their child sounds might not be taken very well.     As far as naming your children according to your background and not necessarily your country of residence is perfectly acceptable. Afterall, what's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet. :)|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I love the name Isabella Grace. I wouldn't have named my other children Spanish names if they weren't spanish and I certainly wouldn't encouarge them this time either. I would stay out of it since the children are theirs unless they want your opinion.
EgXOeDP2aa	I think most people expect the pain,  what they don't expect is the intensity of the pain.  Saying that, all is forgotten the moment you hold your baby.  Just think it can't be that bad or there would be no 2nd babies.|`|POHWTDPRaa	No, it's totally painless. Every single person who has ever given birth is a huge liar. You have to be kidding me.|`|44OH7Si6aa	the epidural itself is VERY uncomfortable when they stick it in your spine, plus you will be having painful contractions while they are doing it and you have to stay perfectly still through it. After that, the contractions aren't as painful but they will still be making you uncomfortable because of the pressure. Sometimes the epidural doesn't really work because it wasn't put in right and you may be pretty much stuck with a natural birth. In my experience, the natural birth wasn't so bad. I had an epidural with my son and it took me a lot longer pushing with him than it did when I had natural birth with my daughter. Then they stitch you up if you tore or they had to cut you, that to me was painful with the natural birth but I didn't feel it with the epidural. You are then sore for a while afterward until you heal up, how long depends on how much you had to have stitched back up. Also, you have contractions after the birth so your uterus can go back down in size and you bleed a whole bunch, sometimes for about three months.|`|FplTPoAyaa	YES. And wait as long as you can...wait until you find a loving, generous, kind man who becomes your husband.  Spend a year or so as man and wife to enjoy one another and then have children.  Children are a wonderful blessing, but having them should be done in a timely manner and only when you are mature enough to handle the responsibility of another life.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Yes it does. it is a reminder of the new responsibility someone has decided to undertake.|`|naySyzfQaa	For me only the contractions hurt like crazy other than that it just feels as though you have to make a huge bowel movement.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I'd like to know who gave you the impression that childbirth doesn't hurt-  OF COURSE IT HURTS!   I didn't feel it when I got the epidural because I was so concentrated on the contractions, but once the epidural was in I didn't feel anything.  But before the epidural it hurt like hell.|`|uDRajB1oaa	of course it does!|`|Dhsyroekaa	nope, not at all|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	I don't want to sound mean, but you're really asking if it hurts??! :) I'm a guy... but i never want to see my wife in that much pain ever again! Regardless if it's giving us a baby!!! She basically described it to me as a human splitting you open and being born! HA! (yep, it hurts!)|`|sSEy6KYiaa	Is the Pope a Catholic?    Yes it hurts - its like trying to **** a foot ball - its a major screaming pain but then its all pretty amazing when you see your new baby for the first time.|`|hnKRu0jwaa	LIKE HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|rAkWoweOaa	Be prepared. It will hurt. No if, ands, or buts about it.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	If you have to ask, you are WAY too young to even think about babies...  Or sex!!|`|okeqhoLPaa	it feels great.     ahha    yeah it can hurt, but having kids is the REAL pain. lol. j/k    the epidural can get rid of most of the pain, and its just like a pinch.     good luck|`|f2MmEMg5aa	Im having my 1st child in may & i already know the answer to that one: HELL YES!!!!!!|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Yeah it hurts, they don't call it labour for nothing!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, it hurts like hell, and anyone who tells you differently is LYING through his teeth!|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Not when you are drugged up.    Without drugs (like I did it), it hurts like nothing else you have ever, or will ever, feel in your life.    But the memory fades.|`|224cm8qtaa	I think it is a pretty well known fact that giving birth doesn't exactly feel wonderful.. PAIN!|`|vL7gkN7uaa	Giving birth is extremely painful.|`|EFYkci30aa	It's the worst pain I've ever felt in my life AND I had an epidural both times!  Kids are so worth it though!!  My second baby was a much smoother, easier, and less painful delivery.  When the time comes, you'll do just fine!    Addition:  Yes, it hurts when they put an epidural in your back but not nearly as much as the whole labor and delivery process.  Feels like a bee sting. . . I'm TERRIFIED of needles but I was begging for my epidural for both pregnancies and the doc who gave it to me was my HERO!  It only hurts for a second and then very soon you just don't feel much pain anymore anywhere. . . .ahhhh.     I don't think your dumb for asking these questions, by the way.  I think it's good to be prepared, even if it's a long way off.  Asking questions is how you learn.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	yes|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	yes it does but it is a pain that you forget ,,|`|85vDqn6naa	oh hell yeah it hurts, the worst pain i ever felt!!!|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Ok well yeah it hurts like hell. That's from my experience. I had an epidural with both of mine and I had back labor with my first and the contractions were freaking horrible but I didn't feel much while she was coming out but with my second the contractions didn't hurt that much but the epidural wore off and I felt him come out and it burned really really bad and I had 2nd degree tearing so yeah it was pretty bad.|`|kdPXhPijaa	This is a trick question, right??    EDIT: Of course, its a dumb question! What are you... five years old???   Phew!!|`|bP5zyipXaa	i went natural with both my sons one hurt one didnt the epidurals can cause you to become perilized if they mess up|`|NgnbtaORaa	I remember discussing this with my partner after she gave birth to our first daughter.  My partner explained to me that contractions are like extremely bad period pains - like period pains times a thousand.  Additionally you, women, are also pushing a baby, and babies aren't that small, all the way from your womb out through your vagina and that is going to hurt right? - additionally, sometimes a woman can tear below, ooowwww.  In  short yep it is agony.|`|ULx2vAB1aa	you are an idiot. giving birth is the number one most painful thing that can happen to you. proven fact|`|sSokoG3oaa	no crap|`|AMGlUYhtaa	its different for evryone lol but probs and alot|`|2bTk5Eixaa	With medication/epidural, you won't feel a thing.|`|rWVQfSKzaa	yes it does the part when your pushing hurts the most|`|EJh9oimXaa	dumb question|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	Yes, it hurts like hell, it's the worst pain in the world!!|`|EiEGlLoRaa	Depending on how you can handle pain. so i guess you will truley never kno until you have one for yourself.|`|Ofn5VWInaa	everyone who hasnt been sitting in a cave their entire life knows that.|`|KTPnlirWaa	Honestly it's not as bad as you might think it is. They have some pretty good meds too.|`|qdq15EF8aa	Yes, but if that concerns you, an epidural anesthetic can help.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	I've NEVER heard of a woman saying anything close to "It didn't hurt at all" when talking about being in labor and giving birth.|`|jdfiIGVaaa	There really isnt any words to describe how badly a natural birth hurts. Even for the weeks afterwards it feels like you crotched a balance beam all day every- day.|`|1jn3W4wMaa	I think it depends on each individual. Some people told me it would be the worst feeling I ever felt in my life, one person said it's a mind thing and it really don't hurt. Me personally I was in pain but it wasn't as bad as everyone told me.|`|iJbslaQNaa	it does|`|Iks1qdElaa	OMG you are obviously not ready to have a child, how on earth could you ask such a silly question. You sound like a child yourself, what do you mean you cant wait till your older to have a boy and a girl, that makes absolutely no sense.     It is called LABOR for a reason, do you know what labor means?? It means WORK giving birth is EXTREMELY painful for most of us, you can take the epidural and it's a breeze during labor.    Please don't have any children until you grow up
L6oSDA5Yaa	i have heard pregnnat women can get them but i am not sure it is a sign. good luck baby dust!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Its not necessarily a symptom but several pregnant women get them as well as yeast infections.  Your body is going thru a lot of changes.|`|FCcbgriuaa	Its not a symptom but when you are pregnant you could get it. As well as when your not. I got it 2 months ago and i wasn't pregnant.|`|FlRfStEgaa	I have never heard of it.  Google it.
jNPCT96Xaa	I am sorry to hear about your loss. As someone who has tried for years and has unsuccessfully carried a child, I can sympathize and relate to how you are feeling. After every loss I say I am giving up and I am not putting myself through this again. I mourn, and time passes, I get another star added to the tattoo I got for my first miscarriage, and I hope for the best. As bad as it hurts, I want to be a mommy more than anything, so I keep trying. I know there is a possibility that there might not be a baby in the end, but until I have literally given every ounce of myself to trying, I can't give up. I can't imagine the pain in which you are going through, but eventually time will pass, and you wont think about it as much.     I am really am sorry this happened to you, as it is something no one should have to go through. Sometimes things happen that are beyond our control. There really isn't anything anyone can tell you that will make you feel better. It wasn't for the best. God had nothing to do with it. And you did nothing wrong.|`|Mj1qhzcIaa	Oh dear! I am so sorry for you! I cant even begin to tell u how bad it feels....yes do take a break- I don't know how- just go away somewhere.....  you did do everything correct...what happened was beyond you- do not blame yourself! Its takes times..but things are going to get better- have faith in God.  All my thoughts and prayers to you and your family!|`|Ka52nbhNaa	I am so sorry for your loss.    Unfortunately, these things do happen . . . you do not mention how far along you were . . . but first trimester miscarriages are usually due to a chromosomal defect that would have prevented the baby from surviving.  There would have been nothing that you could do . . . just nature's mistake.    Please find the help that you need to get through this.|`|pHAKN32yaa	how far along were you?  sometimes the body rejects the fetus. It happens.   I'm really sorry for your loss. i don't know how that feels but you have my deepest sympathy...  Time will heal and you'll try again. You can't give up. Being a mom is the best thing in the world.  I hope you'll give it another try, soon.   just remember: EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON|`|FlRfStEgaa	It is hard to go through a loss, but don't give up all hope.  I lost one of my twin boys.  When it happens, you will think it was all worth it.  Great things WILL come to you!!|`|umI2VZqVaa	oh hunny, the same happened to me a few years back. i know its hard! the only thing that helped me was the doctors said if you miscarry, there most likely was something 'ab normal' with the baby. Keep your head up, and if you and your hubby are well, try again after a few normal periods. you will get your little gift! good luck, and so sorry for your loss!|`|1ajBTe8raa	xxx|`|QoSZQ8ZWaa	So sorry for your loss....I to lost my first baby to a miscarriage.  It was very devastating.  I don't think there is anything stronger than a woman wanting a child.  I had my first child about a year later and my second three years after that.  Both fairly good pregnancies and healthy babies.  Try not to get to discouraged and by no means don't blame yourself.  I pray for comfort for you...|`|72MZ0EG7aa	Ive heard that 70 percent of woman that conceiev to there first child will have amiscarriage that is normal.

I can't even imagine what that would be like to go through but you have my condolences and I wish you the best of luck if and when you do try again.|`|yCR6qg0baa	30% of first pregnancies are lost to miscarriage. There was nothing you or anyone could have done. The baby most likely either did not fully implant or possibly had some kind of genetic deficiency.     Will this happen to you again? There is no way to know other than to try for another. Some women have 1 MC & then 3 healthy kids. Other women have MC after MC.    Another pregnancy will not replace the baby you lost. But you can try again if you still want to have one.|`|XO4talxxaa	Momma G I am so sorry! I'm am sending prayers for you *Hugs*|`|yznZqcznaa	Im sorry to hear that.  This is what happened to me at the end of November when I had my chemical pregnancy.  Im very sorry for your loss, and I understand not knowing if you will try again.  I would just give it time.  You will have another baby soon, and it will be a healthy one that is strong enough to be here with you.|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	Same thing happened to me last year. It was the hardest time of my life and is still hard to this day. Sorry to hear about your loss and god bless you.|`|AfSwDFRcaa	Awww Im sorry to hear this..  Sometimes things that we have no control over happen. You may not have been doing the wrong thing at all. Don't give up hope. I have friends who have had 2 miscarriages in the past and now have healthy kids. Don't blame yourself- this was out of your hands.  TTC and being pregnant is a very emotional rollercoaster.|`|shKc7lZcaa	Aw G, I am so, so, so sorry.  I know you are terribly upset.  I'll say a little prayer for you.  Email me if you need to talk ;)|`|9a3sNrEqaa	I am soooo sorry hun. I just wanted to send you some ::hugs:: hang in there....|`|F8iYNurEaa	I went through this last Thursday. I had just found out that I was 5 weeks pregnant and both my partner and I were over the moon. We had actually conceived on the day that he proposed to me and so everything felt perfect and exciting and it felt like a sign that everything was going to be great for us. Then last Thursday I started bleeding and everything was shattered. I went to the doctor with severe cramping and bleeding and she then sent me to the early pregnancy unit at a nearby hospital who then broke it to me that I was no longer pregnant. Thursday and Friday I was utterly devastated and cried non-stop. Saturday I was still very very upset by it and cried as I told my sister what had happened. However, she knows a lot of people of have had miscarriages and she told me all about them and how they all have gone on to have successful pregnancies, and this made me feel so much better. Yes I was still hurting dreadfully, but it made me realise that one loss doesn't mean there is no chance. It is now a week to the day that I had my miscarriage and I already feel more positive. Yes, I am still very very sad and have so many regrets about what happened, however, I cannot wait to start trying again. I know it hurts so much at the moment, and it will do for a while, but you can't give up. Grieve by all means but don't let this ruin your dream of being a mummy. And don't blame yourself. There is nothing you could have done to prevent it. Unfortunately, it was just one of those things that happens. My advice is to talk about what happened with your partner/family, and if you need to cry then just do it. Please don't give up x|`|JOVWBOOCaa	So sorry to hear the news. I wanted to tell you that the same thing happened to me 6 years ago. On 3/08/03 I went for my ultrasound and because I was cramping, the baby did not make it. It was one of the saddest days of my life and for the next year I wanted nothing more than to have a baby. On 3/08/04 I found out I was pregnant with my daughter. It is hard but things happen for a reason and I know that you will have the baby of your dreams. Sometimes there is nothing we can do. So very very sorry!

o8xNTVWTaa	Sometimes it becomes very difficult to recognize the very early symptoms of pregnancy and as such proper knowledge regarding these signs of pregnancy is essential for any woman.     Missed Period: Missing your monthly cycle is, perhaps, the most commonly recognized sign of pregnancy. Even when the period becomes lighter, most women do not suspect pregnancy until she misses a period. However, you could miss a period due to many other reasons and as such, it's important to do a home pregnancy test to be sure.   Intuition: One of the very early symptoms of pregnancy is the feeling that you are pregnant.   Fatigue: If you feel tired more often than normal, there is a strong likelihood that you are pregnant. Excessive fatigue is a result of the high levels of hormones in your body during pregnancy and the other changes that are taking place during this period.   Tenderness Of Breasts: If you develop tender and swollen breasts that are also sore, pregnancy is a very likely possibility. This can be noticed when you are going to sleep or when you are taking a shower or getting dressed. If you are pregnant, the body is getting ready to produce milk and for breastfeeding. The nipples are also likely to become darker and extra sensitive. This is one of the most apparent very early symptoms of pregnancy.     Frequent use Of Bathroom: If you are pregnant, the swelling uterus will put pressure on your bladder necessitating frequent urination.      Nausea: One of the most widely recognized very early pregnancy symptoms is nausea that is often accompanied with queasiness and vomiting. This very early symptom of pregnancy can start as early as one week into pregnancy.     Dizziness: When you are pregnant, you might feel dizzy or even faint at times.   .   Food Cravings Or Aversions: Most women get odd food cravings during pregnancy or even aversions to certain types of food. If you see any such signs, you can be sure that you are pregnant.     Odor sensitivity: If you are pregnant, you can get nausea by the smell of any of the following: perfume, cleaners, cigarette smoke, certain types of food, gas station, freshly mowed grass etc.     Morning Sickness: One of the very early symptoms of pregnancy is morning sickness. This is also the most commonly recognized sign that most women associate with pregnancy.     The other signs of pregnancy include heartburn, constipation, mood swings, irritability, weight gain, low back pain, implantation bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, bloating and increase in body temperature.     However, some very early symptoms of pregnancy might be subtle and not very distinct and in these cases, you should go geta  home pregnancy test to be sure.    good luck   dont scare ur self tho u could also be thinking about it so much a worrying ur self and ur body could play tricks on you to make u think ur preggers  go get a test !!!|`|m1RTNmqsaa	After a week a HPT willnot show. Id wait 2-3weeks and then take a pregnancy test.    Im not sure how far along you actually have to be for a blood test to show up, but maybe you could see your doctor and see about habing that done?    Goodluck.|`|UYIanZIpaa	Take the test...I was frightened too, I took one very quickly after sex...but it keeps going negative.     Then I realized I was a man...whoops!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	After a week its too early to tell with an over the counter test and with an irregular period that's going to make it wayyy harder.  I'd wait maybe 2 more weeks and let the pregnancy tests start.|`|Z1FdawAOaa	I had the same scare, the best thing to do would be to go to the doctor or a local clinic. They have the most accurate pregnancy tests. Sometimes when you think your pregnant your body and mind will make you think you are then it turns out your not. So go SEE A DOCTOR!! :)|`|tX2giFynaa	Janis  What happen...you are 19...and get sexual contact with that stupid BF.    It is the age of education not for sex. Nov 2008 and no periods...not very sure it is normal.    Contact your family doctor or Anne Edwards|`|5pSieqQbaa	did u take a pregnancy test?|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Ask ur doctor to do a blood test to see if your pregnant. They can tell when Ur 3 days or more pretty neat!|`|pUnjP0Jyaa	what do you mean is there any way you can tell your pregnant umm duh!if you take a hpt or blood test you will know for sure sweetie|`|lHCZUPm2aa	Ok wow, go to your gynecologist. Now! The fact that you haven't had your period in months should have been enough to get you in those stirrups.|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Okay um well you can get a test if its a really good one it can tell 7 days before you miss your period. And if you have unprotected sex you can get pregnant 3 days after and if you haven`t had it since november then you really should go to your doctor.|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Take blood test....or take a pregnancy test 5 days before your missed period......|`|0td65n04aa	A pregnancy test would only be positive after implantation which occurs seven to ten days after fertilization.  If you have implanted it usually take around five days for your body to produce enough HCG to be detected in a home pregnancy test.  Unfortunately, you are in the dreaded two week wait window.  You could try testing now, but would not be able to trust the results until next week at the earliest.      You should see a doctor though if you haven't had a period in three months as this is not normal and may be a sign of a more serious problem.|`|AA11762804	you would not get an accurate result if you test now its waaaaaaay to early, all you can do is wait., wait till you miss your period then take a test|`|h6cRtyiNaa	You should schedule an appointment at your nearest clinic or your Dr.'s office. They will have the most accurate ways of testing for pregnancy, and the methods that they use will be able to tell you faster than a home pregnancy test. Good Luck.|`|105949f392c4fd60ceba61dcfecc2d55aa	you can take a test or go to the doctor, but it would still be to early to tell. Wait at least another week.    there are so many factors, were you ovulating around the time you had sex? if you were and you did get pregnant then it would still take 7-14 days for the fertilized egg to implant and begin producing the hormone that is detectable in the test (so if you test to early you would get a negative and could possibly still be pregnant!)    so give it a little more time, and if you are trying to fet pregnant then good luck and if you are not...then good luck with that too!

vue9NOhYaa	Usually the same things YOU eat, just in smaller amounts.  A toddler can eat pretty much an adult diet -- meats, veggies, fruits, grains, dairy products.

5ViTUTyZaa	My doc and most of the sources I have read say under 300mg of caffiene is considered 'safe'.  The concern is that the consumption will restrict blood flow to the uterus, cutting off the baby's supply of nutrients (same concern as with cigarettes).    I love coffee.  I can tell you what I did - I was about a 6 cup a day (10oz, the normal size of a home coffee cup) coffee drinker.  When I found out I was pregnant I immediately cut down to 3 cups a day.  I did research to find out how much caffiene I was getting.  Turns out, Folgers Dark Roast has about 90mg of caffiene per 10 oz.  So at 3 cups I was under the minimum.  I have stuck w/ that through out the pregnancy.    Dark roasts actually have less caffiene than light roasts (big surprise to me!) and home brews (Folgers, Maxwell House, etc...) have less caffiene than cafe (Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, etc...).    I am 36w4d and everything is fine.  My blood pressure is very good and according to the u/s the blood flow to the baby is fine.|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Dont drink any of that stuff....|`|5Lec3COSaa	I'm due with my first in less than 2 weeks. My doctor told me that 2 cups of caffeine a day is safe. Since I'm a coffee-a-holic, I drink a few cups of 1/2 caf 1/2 decaf (Maxwell House Lite) a day which completely does the trick!!  =)|`|AA11762804	i would cut out ALL caffien from your diet, to much of it and you can loose the baby, i am craving a large white mocha from starbucks but i cant have it ="(|`|n5Sx4WwYaa	well i LOVE starbucks  and my obgyn told me that i can drink up to 2 cups and it will have no effect on the baby hope i helped and drink up lol :)|`|kcGFK36Waa	I avoid it through the first trimester but had it the last 2 trimesters and my daughter is fine and her sleeping habits are great. Just don't over due it too much.|`|LABC73E7aa	they say its ok to have a cup of tea coffee or soda daily.|`|rnTNu6MTaa	The doctor said it's ok to have a cup of Coffee or soda...but it's better not to make a habit of it. :)|`|CuCrGDuRaa	My doctor told me to avoid caffeine the best I can during pregnancy.  Caffeine has been linked to miscarriage and it restricts blood flow to the placenta.  Also, babies whose mothers consumed caffeine during pregnancy were found to be much more irritable and slept less consecutive hours than other babies.    Decaffeinated tea and coffee contain phenols, which reduce the absorption of iron to your baby.    I used to drink several cups of coffee a day before I was pregnant but haven't had a single one during pregnancy because it's just not worth the risk.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Cut back on your caffeine intake. I love dr pepper so i stopped buying it when I was pregnant . I would treat myself and have some 3 times a month sometimes more. I would drink caffeine when my head hurt and it helped so much.      So a little bit is fine just try not to have any and just treat your self every now and then is fine.|`|jpMi2D5Jaa	With my last two pregnancies I drank a can of coke daily or at least almost daily, and my daughters are smarter than ever! They were fine, it's ok in moderation. Congrats!|`|yWlRRME2aa	I've heard that if you can't get rid of caffeine all together, just limit it to once a day. As long as you aren't drinking a ton, you will not harm your baby whatsoever.

Her life will also change even more. This is a very serious. Unless you are making between 50-60,000 dollars a year, you will be on welfare! Babies need everything from a-z. Doctor visits are a must so get perpared to be broke or poor for the next 18 to 25 years. Don't put your baby off on someone else because it will come back on you big time! You have to be careful about the decisions you make now because your dealing with a life. If you have absolutely every thing you need to care for this baby, it will go a little smoother. Remember, it takes finance and love to care for a child. Life is about choices.

Like whole wheat flour and flax, whole wheat chopped pretzels, cereals.  We marinate in different things too like honey, orange juice, a little seseame oil, etc.  This will subtly help them develop tastes for other flavors.   I always suggest gettting the free Kraft food and family magainze too, on their website.  Some things are way too processed - as thats what they sell, but have some good ideas on the basics - and good pictures for kids to pick from.    The noname brand - thats really their name - "noname"  has some really good pre-made chicken things (we'll get when I need a last minute entertaining type dish)  like cordon blue, they are a little pricey but I usually get them with good coupons and sales at Target.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	OMG, I have the perfect recipe, you must try it.    At our house we call it 500 degree chicken.  It's really fast, easy, tasty, and wholesome.  ------------------------------------  Ingredients:    Chicken Breast (sliced into fingers, you can usually get about 5 per breast)  Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs  Parmesan Cheese  Eggs  Flour  Buttermilk.  -----------------------------------  -Cut chicken into strips and submerge in buttermilk for about 45 minutes.  -In the meantime, set up 3 shallow dishes and fill one with flour, the other with egg, and the third with the Italian bread crubs.  -Add some of the Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs and mix.  -Begin by preheating your oven to 500 degrees Centigrade, not sure what that is in Farenheit, but it's HOT HOT HOT!!!   -Take out one of the chicken strips from the buttermilk, dunk in flour, then in egg, then in the bread crumb/cheese combination and place on a foil lined baking sheet.  Repeat until all coated.  - Sprinkle with more parmesan cheese and drizzle with olive oil.  DRIZZLE, do not SOAK.  -Place in your oven for about 15 minutes.    When you take them our you'll swear they were fried!  So yummy.  My daughter likes them with a bit of Plum Sauce, but I prefer mine straight up.     We usually accompany with some Asparagus and Rice.    Stay away from things like Shake and Bake and thier grocery store counterparts.  They're loaded, and I mean LOADED in salt.  No offense to any that suggest it.|`|tRNwh2yxaa	They say toddlers like chicken drummies or wings to chew on.  My daughter hasn't figured out how to eat them yet, but I did try this recipe.

They're pretty tasty!|`|V52z8kEdaa	Ultimate Chickpea Noodle Soup    I found petite dried ceci beans at a local Italian shop to use in this soup, but standard-sized beans work beautifully as well. I used a bit of vegetable bouillon to create a quick broth - the Rapunzel brand (regular with herbs) is a favorite. Soak your beans overnight or at the very least for a few hours before cooking the soup - in a pinch you could conceivably get away with using canned beans.    4 cups water or a mild vegetable stock  2 cups pre-soaked ceci beans (also known as chickpeas or garbanzo beans)  6 ounces fresh or dried pappardelle    1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil  sea salt    Bring the stock and ceci beans to a simmer and cook until the beans are cooked through. Taste and season with salt - you will need more or less depending on how salty your stock (bouillon) is. I wanted my broth to have a bit more body so I scooped out a small handful of cooked beans (20 or so), pureed them with a hand blender, and added them back into the pot -an optional step and not necessary if you opt for a homemade chicken stock which tends to have more body (from the gelatin in the bones)...this was my vegetarian work-around.    While the beans are cooking, boil the pappardelle in well-salted water. Drain and set aside 1/3 of the cooked noodles, you are going to fry these. Also, hang on to a cup (or two) of the pasta water in case you need a bit more liquid for your soup.    Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add the reserved noodles and fry them up until they are nice and crispy, don't let the oil get overly hot, it should be nicely fragrant and able to do its crisping job. Just remember, you are going to use it later in the recipe, so you don't want it to get to its smoking point.    Add the boiled-not-fried noodles into the bean pot and taste for seasoning, salt if needed (add in the reserved pasta water here if you want a bit more broth, but I like this soup light on the liquid). Spoon about 3 tablespoons of the olive oil from the skillet into the soup and serve with a generous sprinkling of the fried noodles mixed in at the last minute. A drizzle of your favorite table olive oil is a great way to finish the soup.    Serves 4.|`|J6jZLt0caa	You can make her home made chicken strips... or boil the chicken and then shred it. My son loves it shredded. Or you can make her some chicken quesadillas (Grilled Cheese and shredded chicken in a tortilla). My son loves those too. I'm sure she'll like it.

yNbGq4viaa	Most pediatricians recommend beginning to wean your baby off the bottle at 10 months because they no longer get the all the nutrients they need from formula and the sugars in the milk can rot their developing teeth.  If your baby is filling up on milk then he won't be as willing to take his baby food or fruit; however, if he is congested he probably has some drainage in his stomach that may be making him feel icky.  Also, he may be unable to breathe through his nose while he is trying to eat.  I would definitely recommend taking him to the doctor for some meds if you haven't already and speaking with the doctor or a nutritionist about his daily intake of different foods.|`|h6UXw3Dxaa	Hes a sick child.  Give plenty of fluids, anything that he'll drink except milk.  A humidifier in the room at night.  Just keep giving him fruit, that will hydrate him and give him nutrients at the same time.  I wouldn't wean him from the bottle until he's feeling better.|`|VSZlXRpFaa	Well, if he is sick, I would first take him to the doctor to get some medicine because when little ones dont feel well, they dont want to eat... then I would try giving him soft foods... maybe chicken noodle soup or vegetable soup where they are easy to chew. Also try baby food or cereal? The most important is to keep him hydrated until he feels better... but definitely take him to the doctor or at least buy him some over the counter medicine... poor thing..|`|sXhPtBfXaa	I wouldn't force you sick little guy to eat. My son gets that way too when he is congested. I just let him eat what he'll eat. Usually some yogert or fruit with lots of liquids. At bedtime I would use salinex to break up the boogies if he has a runny nose. For his cough some cough syrup would help...just give him half of the recommended dosage for a 2 year old.
yCwPxulYaa	I am 21 years old and have slept with white noise since I was a child.  I CANNOT sleep without it.  I just use a regular fan and turn it on high.  I face it towards the wall in the winter so I don't get cold.      Anything like that should do the trick.  I truely believe that it helps them sleep better (it reminds them of the noises from the womb).|`|n6XYYyoLaa	we use a little fan that we bought at walmart for about ten or fifteen bucks; i think it is a 'turbo' fan or something for white noise along with a womb bear when she's getting to sleep; that lil fan on high is loud enough to give her the white noise she needs.....and i helps tremendously, i don't think she would sleep without it as she has always slept with a fan blowing....and it is supposed to reduce sids now they say....  she's a great sleeper by the way, don't know if it is the white noise, but i think so....also keeps her from hearing every little thing i do while she naps...|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	There are all kinds of inexpensive sound effects machines available.  I have one that has eight different sounds, including rain, waves and yes, white noise.    I wouldn't recommend it for a 13 month old.  You want her to learn to stay asleep.  If you start white noise at 13 months, she will "learn" to only sleep if she has it.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Yes, white noise is wonderful.  I have a little forced air fan/heater in my baby's room and in the older boys room.  I turn it on at all nap and bed times year round.  I've always needed white noise to sleep and I began doing this with my first when he was first born.  You can get them anywhere, wal-mart, target, Ace, wherever they sell fans and heaters.|`|5Crovdoaaa	I'm with Abigail's Mommy...i've slept with a fan since I was little and have terrible trouble sleeping when we go out of town. In the middle of winter, I turn it away from me so it's just the noise..but they do sell white noise machines. My 3 boys all sleep with the radio turned to classical music, just at a low volume.|`|zwctZ812aa	We use a dehumidifier in my son's room for white noise.  It's good for babies to have one in the nursery, and the soft humming is lulling to him.  It sounds a lot like our space heater, which we used for white noise before, but were having the same problem as you with it shutting off.  We got ours at Target.  It was inexpensive...I think about $20.00|`|igohncGWaa	noise does really help babys sleep...my one lil cuzin always fell asleep at the sound of a vacume cleaner he loved it...so his mom just taped the sound of a vacum cleaner..and it worked!!..so what u can do is tape the sound of a heater...and if you dont want to so that more baby stores sell things that make noise like that so you can buy it there...hope this helped good luck:)|`|ruGhNDmUaa	My daughter would wake up at the AC going off and on all night.  I just bought a cheap oscillating fan and put that in her room.  It works the same as a white noise machine.  Just make sure you have the fan in the stationary position, and turned away from the crib.|`|G35ERUifaa	My five month old also sleeps much better with white noise.  Instead of buying a pricey white noise machine, we just use a radio tuned to a station with static.  Works like a charm.|`|WANysA23aa	White noise does helps baby's sleep. For now I keep the heater on at night. Maybe you can purchase some womb sounds for babies or you can record some of your own.
07658108bf84ff22af742f784fa5ea0aaa	I would have 2 girls 6 and 7 year old to babby sit after school also i have to get them and stay with them unt?  9:30 with them in my house and she wants also to babby sitt on weekends sometimes how much will be a least during the school period until 9:30? tx for help  Translation:  I am going to be babysitting for two girls, aged 6 & 7. I will pick them up and stay with them until 9:30 PM at my house.  The mother also needs some sitting on the weekends.

Do you want permission to babysit?  Ask your mom.|`|76DMnYwnaa	i charge depending on the kids not the time, the women who i sit for pays me 20 per child per day...so 40 a day...     but it depends on the women.. i mean ur not a professional and u don't want to ask for too much    i think u should ask her how much she is comfortable with then just be grateful...
rMNWd17saa	Most babies at some point during pregnancy have the cord wrapped around their neck.  Your baby is still small enough that he/she has plenty of room to move around and several weeks to get untangled.  You doctor is aware of it and will monitor it closely.  If it is still wrapped around when you go into labor, your doctor will be keeping a close watch on baby's heart rate on the monitor to be sure that it doesn't drop during your contractions.  This is a sign that baby is in distress.  They will take whatever measures are necessary to be sure that you and baby are both safe.  If heart rate looks good they will go ahead and deliver and as baby's head comes out they will have you stop pushing and will quickly slip the cord over the head.  Then you can start pushing again and finish delivering baby.  If baby's heart rate is showing signs of distress the may decide that it is best to go ahead and perform a c- section. baby can be delivered in as little as 10 minutes once they decide to do it.   If this occurs, don't worry!  You and baby will be fine!  C-sections are not as bad as some people make it out to be.  I have had 2 and I prefer it to a vaginal birth. (my second c-section we didn't find out til they began surgery, that baby was feet first and cord was wrapped around 3 times tightly, she wouldn't have survived a vaginal delivery) If you get closer to your due date and it is still wrapped around, you should be prepared for c-section just in case.  (it is less scary if you know what to expect)  talk to your doctor.  If you want to email me I will go through step by step what happens during a c-sections and what you will experience, as well as what to do afterward to help with recovery.    Good luck!|`|4AO2myzKaa	The baby has enough room in there that it shouldn't be a problem.  When strangulation is a problem is late third tri when they run out of room and the fluid is lower...I heard one in five babies is born with a loop of cord around their neck because of the conditions in there.  Heck, baby's first "toy" is usually the cord, but I wouldn't worry at this point in the game, it's probably not even on there anymore|`|vue9NOhYaa	Not a problem.  A large percentage of babies have the cord around their neck.  It causes no trouble.  It may 'unwrap' as baby continues to turn and move around over the next 20 weeks, or it may stay wrapped. If it does, when baby emerges at birth, the doctor will just slip it over baby's head or, if it's too short/tight for that, cut it before baby is fully born.    EDIT: Despite the thumbs down -- NOT a problem.  VERY rarely does this cause any issues -- at worst, baby might need to be born by c-section if the cord is so tangled that baby can't emerge.  The medical term is 'nuchal cord.'  But at 21 weeks, there's zero cause for concern.     http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0...    http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch261/ch...    (scroll down to the bottom of the page)    http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/26...|`|NUBeg2paaa	I would be a little worried but then again, everyone is not a doctor. They do not have a PhD. Your doctor however said there was nothing to worry about, so if she said there is nothing to worry about then there is nothing to worry about.|`|yVuJkdXCaa	well i had a twin sister and at birth it was wrapped around her head in the womb and strangled her to death, but your baby still has time to move about etc and if it is still wrapped round the babies neck you can get a C- section   Good luck and congratulations :)|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	The doc probably isn't too concerned yet as your baby is still small enough and has room to wriggle around in there, and may likely untangle the cord from around his/her neck. Plus how was the heartbeat? If the heart beat was normal then the baby is in no distress.|`|Snq8YSMPaa	On Discovery Health during delivery time most of the babies have the cords around their necks!!!!!|`|tCmwFJn5aa	You can always get a 2nd opinion.      I had to have an emergency c-section because my baby at 40 weeks had the cord wrapped around his neck.  It is dangerous, so I do recommend that the fetal heartbeat be closely monitored.
jswhfzg8aa	Hi, When I was pregnant the first time, I suspected I was before my period was due, anyway the day my period was due I took a test & It came up negative, then a few days later the doctor did a urine test on me & that came back negative with still no period in sight. So the doctor booked me for an ultrasound to make sure there wasn't any other problems a few days later, after the ultra sound I went home & did another test as I was worried & It came up positive! I was pregnant!  It's weird how things work, so If your hoping to be pregnant just wait a little longer... good luck|`|oOBg9hshaa	try taking another test in a few days if AF hasnt showed up yet, sometimes it takes a while for a test to detect that positive|`|AA10838327	hi i'm 13 days late and i also took 2 test and both negative i've made a doctors apt to see whats going on i really hope i am pregnant!!  i think u could be pregnant just wait a little longer some times they say stress makes ur period be late!! ok well good luck and wish me luck too!!
oOBg9hshaa	wait it out, it's possible you could be pregnant but the soonest you can test is five days before your missed period, good luck|`|j4Mjc4Ecaa	try some hpts, and yes you could be pregnant.  Good luck!|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Yes is does sound like you very well maybe pregnant.  In my first pregnancy i started getting symptoms a few weeks on which included nausea, sore breasts etc.    The light blood you experienced may of been implantation bleeding this normally occurs 6-10 dpo.    The best thing to do is wait til the 10th Feb and take a pregnancy test and see what the outcome is, some woman wait until a week after a missed period to save disappointment in case their period is a few days late.    Best of luck and i hope you get the results you want xx
oUcLSDZ6aa	I wouldn't worry (actually, at 39 weeks, I probably would have, but I worried about everything), in retrospect I wouldn't worry.     However, if you ever just need to be re-assured, call up your doctor/hospital/midwife and ask. That's what they're there for, and get paid for, plus you'll feel better!    Congratulations!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's your guts moving - a good thing, many of us have audible guts without being pregnant.|`|ROJans2Taa	totally normal, your digestive tract is being cramped by your uterus, and also the hormone Progesterone also wreaks havoc in your lower intestines. It relaxes the smooth muscles of your intestines which slows their ability to contract well. Waste from your digestive tract will tend to remain there longer, more water is absorbed .  mine as well was very noisy, best luck|`|6qNYzZC2aa	its ok don't panic as long as you can feel your baby move every things ok just your tummy making noises x
bvt9kvS8aa	lol....  let it go|`|i2JKqsqYaa	ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww|`|FklngtvCaa	D:  I'd pretend I didn't see.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Pretend you didn't see anything.  I'm sure you did the same at her age.|`|3hkArqvbaa	lol. :) just try to forget about it.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Leave her be. It's perfectly normal for people from infancy to adulthood to pleasure themselves and healthy to do so.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	dont worry about it.. pretend you didnt see, if she saw you see just leave it alone.. im sure she will catch you one day too and it will be just as imbarrassing as it was to her|`|XUSq0gHoaa	Just leave her!|`|KwkEvmpPaa	Nothing it's pretty normal just pretend like nothing happened|`|nr3sm3u5aa	pretend like you didnt see anything ! & dont spy on her next time lmao|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	Don't worry about it. I am sure if you bring it up she will be even more embarrased. Just move on and try not to talk about it. It is just a part of life.|`|AtDlNnIBaa	just pretend you didnt see any of thing. or just ask is there is something she wants to talk about.|`|9zwSclnLaa	I would pretend nothing happened.  It's a private thing and it will just be embarrassing for both of you if you say anything.  It's complete normal and those who think it's gross are the people who are uptight [because they don't do it, lol].|`|P4u9yOHKaa	well sounds like that time has come when her mom or somebody has to tell her about the "birds and the bees"...but dam 10 and already doing that stuff.  good luck and that|`|HN2nAsMhaa	let it go. It's normal and you probably do it or will do it in the near future. She's fine and don't be a tattletale|`|6aoJhFp4aa	Let it go. who cares? it's not like something bad is gunna happen cause of it. Would your parents be upset about that???|`|rlqaBhr8aa	Your parents need to know that.|`|CGkDRRnvaa	Just leave her. im suree you've dunnit before. everyone has. it feels good. why shildnt she do it. everyones tried it, some do it everynightt.|`|n9OJVVsdaa	Let her be. Thell go to hell for it later!
URuzNGcyaa	While your at it suggest a section titled "Halp!! Halp!!! can I get pregnant if I look at dried c*m from 20 feet away while wearing a pair of ugg boots and my period is due in 26 days"|`|a69001f55cbd3bf5748b983dfe3b2b36aa	YES!!!!!!!!!!|`|xepgFQBTaa	Yes i get so annoyed with how many people ask that. .|`|pyHLroPBaa	No, there should be an insta-ban for it.|`|AVL2IS7Laa	yes and i think they should have one for miscarriages as well|`|648b91bd2155bc10a7c864b70e696c67aa	yes|`|AjPbtm7oaa	It should be a whole different site.  They should also add a section for Mucus Plugs.    You can make a suggestion by going to the YA Forum. The link is at the bottom of the home page on the lft side under "Related Links".|`|buRyMeL9aa	OMG yes i totally agree!!!!!!!!!|`|z7w6xyOKaa	Yes! I also think there should be a separate section for the abortion questions.|`|p68DUZhCaa	its not like y!a forces you to answers those questions...if ya don't like em don't answer them!     COMMON SENSE|`|T5E0rDyYaa	Nope, such questions should just be banned!|`|Zf18VjlCaa	I think there should be an island for teen moms....|`|nISYAHkfaa	There should be a default answer at the top of the page. And it should read: "Take a pregnancy test. If you have taken a pregnancy test, it came back negative, and you are unsure, see your doctor. See your doctor if you do not have your period within two weeks of the day that it's due." That would take care of so much, lol.
ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I'm due February 17. I don't think there is anyone who can accurately predict your due date.... they can take guesses.    I'm feeling pretty anxious myself. Hang in there, knowing that they can't stay in there forever is the only thing keeping me going!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	That baby will come when that baby wants to.  Your considered term now so technically baby CAN come at any time or baby can still go over due.  Walk walk walk walk walk and walk some more.  Do some squats to engage baby, and have sex to soften the cervix.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	A psychic is not going to help you.  Your baby will come when it's good and ready.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	ya i'm due the 17th too and it's coming up so just chill out. i know how anxious u are for it to happen TRUST me but u really want a dumb psychic to tell u something that a doctor already gave u an educated guess on? LOL.
K50XI0N9aa	I'd say pregnant for sure. The 1st batch of urine u used may have contained a higher concentration of HCG than the second. Don't worry too much; but if u must, take another test with your first urine of the day. Congrats and good luck!!|`|lnUrm4sGaa	mmm thats weird are you able to do another test|`|gwuTKiNXaa	I would take another test first thing in the morning|`|JjBwydymaa	I think you are preggers. Congratulations!    Do another tomorrow morning.. first moring wee is the best wee to use!     Good luck x|`|SUR1MHqWaa	I would deffo say pregnant|`|VMASMHX6aa	You are pregnant! The 'pregnant' message doesn't last for long as the test only has a very limited battery in it. The next one probably said not pregnant as the urine you used wasn't quite as concentrated.|`|zdXjIaojaa	Some pregnancy tests show up positive after 5 mins....that happened to me, but I wasn't pregnant. Tests shouldn't be read after 5 mins. Although I've never used the digital ones.    Do another test in the morning.    Good luck!|`|CluOhrXWaa	take another if you can afford it goodluck hun :) let me know outcome x
f2ae56134c701bec40583a856d15ba10aa	That doesn't sound normal. It doesn't mean you are pregnant, but you should see your doctor as soon as possible to try to figure out what the issue is. Best of luck|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Thats definately not normal.. Your doctor may need to give you a hormone called provera to jump-start you period.. Make an OB appointment asap. Good Luck!!|`|m1RTNmqsaa	Ive always been told cheap or expensive pregnancy test they all do the same thing that it didn't matter.    Id say wait a week and retest. If it comes out negative Id be talking to my doctor, if not before hand.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	Perhaps pregnant again?|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Go see your doctor.   You could still  be pregnant...even with a negative test.|`|sKwTnTw9aa	if you are on the pill this is normal.|`|m5jNvq7waa	yeah that doesn't sound right.. i would head to you doctors asap|`|nLFr9csfaa	That is odd cuase it seemed like I had a period for 4 months after my baby. Seriously I'm exaggerating but you should definitley metion it to your doctor. Call your doctor's office and ask to talk to a nurse. Tell them what's going on and they will advise you if you need to come in or not.
AA10315542	I am due Sept 3, and the ultrasound said I conceived on Dec 11.   Good luck.|`|Dhsyroekaa	google it|`|OEKhv65faa	You have to go by your last menstrual cycle. I looked in my pregnancy book and if you are due on 9/5... you cycle normally comes around 11/29-30. Conception normally happens 12 days from there so it was most likely around the 14.    My due date is 9/7/09.|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Anywhere from november 27 to november 30 I think.|`|fTLzKg5Eaa	Your conception date was most likely Saturday, December 13, 2008   But remember you are in an early stage of pregnancy and Due date might change...|`|evRfXzQ0aa	I am also due on Sept 5 and I conceived on 12/12...So I would say you conceived on the 14th
KHeKiFg8aa	Yes!!! I absolutely did feel that way ! After my daughter was born (who is now almost 2,5 years old) I was missing the bump but it was more than that! I wanted to have a baby! I thought I was crazy! I had just given birth to the most wonderful daughter in the world and here i was wanting to have another one. This feeling lasted for about 3-4 months after which I decided that I wasn't going to think about having another baby and that I was just going to focus on my daughter! About 1-2 months passed AND I found out I was pregnant again !!!! My daughter was 5,5 months at that time! :) Now, we have our second daughter (she is 1,2 years old) and we have our third arriving in a little less than 6 months !!!     So, don't think you're crazy....I've been there too ! :)|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I feel that way sometimes. I have a 10yr old son and a 4mo old daughter. After I had my son, I was very very content with the one child. His father passed away and for years, it was just my son and me. I thought that was an ideal situation and was extremely happy once I got thru my grieving period.     Once I had my daughter, things changed. I sometimes find myself wanting another baby but my husband is doesn't want anymore. I'm 32 now so if he doesn't change his mind in the next year or two, I'm going to give the idea up because I would rather not have any babies after 35. Although I sometimes feel I want another one, it's not a strong urge to where I'd be bothered if we don't get to have another. I'm very happy with my family as it is now.|`|eeGN977eaa	After my first daughter I wanted another child so badly. The desire was consuming. When she was 4 we did. After my second daughter was born I felt complete contentment. It will go away only when you are content.|`|jp7YvYNuaa	I say wait|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I want another baby so bad.  My oldest will be 3 in 2 weeks, and my youngest is 18 months.  So they are close together, it's really hard, but I would not change it for the world!  I also want another baby, in the near future, and my husband says, no way..no more.  It really bugs me that he doesn't want to have one more.  Our boys are going through phases right now, that are quite stressful, but in everyway it's worth it....ENOUGH, to do it all again.  My husband disagrees.  I think I will get my way though...lol.|`|Sm0rYAnCaa	Are u nuts? Focus on giving the very best of you to these two kids! Don't overpopulate your life and family! If you have  another kid, your kids will have less possiblities of succeed. Unless you are a very wealthy person!  Good Luck!|`|buoqtZeFaa	I dont see anything wrong with feeling that way.  It just sounds like you love kids and want to expand you family quickly.  Just respect you fiance feelings and you will have more kids in time.      Good luck and enjoy your two beautiful blessings!!!|`|hvu6Z8dnaa	This is a difficult subject for me.  I have three children, a daughter who is six, and two sons aged 2 and four months and 1 and three months.  I am also pregnant with baby number four!  As you can tell from my childrens ages there was a rather small gap between my darling sons.  This was so not planned!  After I had my daughter I was desperate to add to my family and had a lot of trouble, in fact I had 11 miscarriages before successfully carrying my eldest son.  However that pregnancy, with my two year old, was very difficult and I spent a large portion of it in hospital.  When I found out I'd fallen pregnant again when he was three months old I was horrified.  I didn't think my body could cope with it and i didn't think it was very fair on my son.  I spent the majority of my pregnancy in denial and when he was born, distressed and blue with the cord wrapped round his neck I felt so guilty.  I had PND after the birth, I think because I had been in denial all through the pregnancy and then the trauma of his birth I found it hard to bond with him and I think he picked up on this as he was more demanding than my other two children in those early days.  By the time my husband arrived in from work I just handed him the baby and I wanted to curl and bawl my eyes out.  I found I had less patience with my other children and I was crying all the time over the silliest things.  Luckily I had a really supportive health visitor who spotted my distress and she sorted me out.  I always loved my children I just found it hard to cope with two babies constantly demanding all my attention.    Now we are fine, and I'm expecting again in the summer, this time totally planned and wanted and I'm determined not to fall into that despair I felt with two small boys last time.  My mum is horrified, or was when I told her, but she has slowly come round to the idea and I have learnt that having the children close together means they have each other for company, and my boys are so close its unreal.  But you really have to think seriously before trying again, and take into account how your partner feels.|`|B2dQop3oaa	Just wait it out.. You're used to being pregnant, people want to stick to things they're used to.    Focus on your 2 children first. It's your task to raise them as proper human beings. Unlike many things, there is no rewind button, so think out things carefully.     Besides, the more children you have, the more it's financially a challenge to keep up with all their needs. And don't you go "but we've got enough for all of them" on us, no: they'll need to go to school, perhaps university later on. They'll have hobbies, that require money. And last but not least: You need to eat, be prepared for any financial difficulties (like sickness, ..), and HAVE PROPER SAVINGS.
9OsjdsrZaa	Is he teething?  My little ones always went through a grumpy stage right around 6 months.  Have a good look at his gums and see if any white bumps are forming.  If so...he is teething.   Try putting his favorite toys in the frig., it is great for soothing sore gums.   If not, try looking into his playtime.  Mix things up a little for him.  Babies can get bored at this age with the same toys.  Try moving him to a different location for playtime, or take him on a walk and let him meet the great outdoors.  It could be that he just wants to explore more.     Good luck!  It is never easy trying to figure out what your baby needs.  Your best bet is trial and error.|`|yECN3lvUaa	Grumpy? Well of course he's grumpy, he's a baby! All you have to do with a grumpy kid is make him laugh. 6 months is quite a young age so you shouldn't be tickling him or you will accidently claw him to death (unless you do it gently)    Make him watch mickey mouse clubhouse or make funny faces and problem SOLVED!|`|O43iBsagaa	It is probably a phase or he may be teething...sometimes it takes awhile for those teeth to come through and that will make a baby "grumpy". He might also be ready for a more solid food if he is only on formula..Good Luck!
UUpsa35Daa	Parents should start to explain it as soon as the child is old enough to start to understand it...around 2 or 3, maybe sooner. Even though they shouldn't be away from their parents, things can happen, and it would be best if they knew how to react. Also, the sooner that you start explaining, the more they'll understand when they get to an age where they'll be semi-alone.    I know a mother who had yet to teach her 5 year old about stranger danger, they went to a park and she sat on the bench while her son was playing on the equipment maybe 10 or 15 feet away. She said he was always in her sight but that's doubtful considering he was taken by a man and was found in a house about 20 minutes away. She hadn't so much of even started to talk to him about it and the boy had no idea what to do or how to react to the things this man was telling him. It could've been prevented had his mother started explaining things to him at an earlier age.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	~???~... I was wondering the same thing.     I started at 2.  I have a very, very social child and it hasn't been easy but extremely important b/c of this.      Hate is such a strong word, BTW.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	From day one, in increments, throughout their lives, adding more nuance & information as they become able to process it.|`|AA10494763	We are trying to do it now and she is two.  She is a little to friendly and we are concerned with all the crazy in the world she may just walk off  with someone    That would be hard though because she is not allowed out of our site but stranger things have happened|`|r07BwhO1aa	I have been doing it from the time she could understand.  Why the hate for Texas Mommy?  She seems nice.      I remember one time we were in the store and she was just over one and this little old lady started talking to her and my daughter yelled "You are a stranger leave me alone"  I was embarrassed because it was a little old lady but the woman told me it was good that she recognized that she was a stranger and should not be talking to her.|`|rAkWoweOaa	As soon as they can walk, and are able to wonder off. I am a mother from Texas. Do you hate all mommies from Texas or is this a certain person. Just wondering....|`|gUxpwEXbaa	As soon as possible, my son is 1 year and 3 months, and every time I go I out I tell him not to go with strangers. Even though he might not understand me it cant hurt can it?|`|jvW3a5GYaa	As soon as they learn to walk.|`|6kRhLbs9aa	I agree...as soon as they learn to walk! There are a lot of creepies out there! Good luck and God bless!|`|hThW3ioKaa	...Gee I wonder who this could be... and who is the one who needs to grow up!     As far as your question goes however, I say as early as possible. From the moment they start playing outside on their own (even in the backyard) or waiting at a bus stop (even with you there) any moment where you feel you can slip in "You know if anyone comes up to you and tries to start talking to you....." then you should go ahead and slip it into the conversation. We've been talking to my oldest about it since he started daycare, and my youngest for as long as I can remember since he was always around while we were talking to the other kids!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You tell them as early as they can understand. Don't forget to tell them about inappropriate touching by others also.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	I have only said something to her once thus far when she darted away to go see some dog at the park. Once she saw that the dog had an owner she stopped dead in her tracks. I do however tell her to hold my hand and stay with mommy so no one will take her away from me. She's only 2 but she pretty much picks up on my cues. If I'm not friendly to someone she's not friendly. I really have to encourage her to be friendly.
u0mZAPuDaa	I don't think your HCG levels are ever supposed to drop during pregnancy.    I want to know how you know your HCG levels; what did the doctor say?|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Sorry to say but your probably miscarrying. In a healthy pregnancy, your HCG levels double every day. Your symtoms wont go away for like a week or 2 after the miscarriage is completed. Im soo sorry :-(|`|jNgh3e3Faa	The hCG goes up at first...and then peaks.  The level will reach its peak in the first 8 - 11 weeks of pregnancy and then will decline and level off for the remainder of the pregnancy.    I too, want to know how you know your hCG levels.|`|kbIkVS0raa	I'm pretty sure that your levels should not drop and if they do then you will lose the baby. I would ask the doctor but I don't think thats a good sign|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, sorry to say.  In a healthy pregnancy, your HCG level should double every 48 hours or so.  When it drops, it is the first sign of miscarriage.  This happened to me and was the only symptom I had that I was miscarrying.  I felt perfectly fine and had all of my pregnancy symptoms, but the baby had stopped growing.|`|P7Bu2I8eaa	You should definitely worry, because HCG LEVELS should double every 48 hours, and if your droping it could mean that you are miscarrying. I advise you to have another evaluation to be sure, and if it comes to that predictament, I am sorry, and Spread baby dust to you and your partner for next try around.... Best wishes|`|NUmeIxyfaa	I had the same thing but infortunaley still lost the baby. But, please call your dr if you are worried.     I am sorry for your loss, if that is what it is.|`|dlKeoknPaa	It happened to me and I lost my baby. you definitely need to get checked out. Hope everything works out.
fTLzKg5Eaa	No baby will start moving form 18-20 weeks, However I am in my week 17 and I started feeling Butterflies today. Go to this website baby2see.com it is a very good website which will take you through each week explaining everything along with pictures.    Congratulations and best of Luck!|`|7C9Ett7Caa	I copied and pasted this next paragraph from whattoexpect.com. I didnt feel my baby move till around 20 weeks. If your over-weight, it may take much longer to feel the baby. My obese friend didnt feel her baby till about 35 weeks...    As you near the end of your first trimester, your uterus, now about the size of a large grapefruit, begins to migrate from the bottom of your pelvis to a front-and-center position in your abdomen. If you're lucky, this will bring an end to one pesky early pregnancy symptom  the constant urge to urinate. Also slated to diminish somewhat now that you're on the cusp of your second trimester are some of those other early pregnancy symptoms: nausea, super-tender breasts and nipples, food aversions, fatigue. But don't look now (though  considering the symptom  maybe you should), there's a new one added to the mix: dizziness.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	read this it will answer u questions it has everything on this page CONGRATS http://www.womenshealthcaretopics.com/pr...|`|Zpzp1W2kaa	They say you don't normally feel anything till you are about 18 weeks or so I believe. Do a search online or read What to Expect when your Expecting. It's a good learning tool!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	you wont feel anything til around 16 weeks the earliest/|`|QnSKaBcjaa	not yet. when you do it might feel like little flutters or bubbles :)|`|gga2mwFIaa	with my first i didnt feel any different except tender breasts then I felt the baby move around 5 months. I always feel a little light headed when standing up normal and feel more tired but thats about it at this early.|`|85vDqn6naa	baby moves but u wont feel it as it is to small, should really be feeling good at this point,but it should be uneventful right now. good luck|`|8eGrFwXQaa	you should feel tired.  I didnt feel him kick until around 20 weeks.|`|pHAKN32yaa	http://www.babycenter.com/6_your-pregnan...
JyWCPVfzaa	I don't know, for some reason I like this name. I know it's a little common...not too much, just a little...but I still like it.|`|HurPmgSaaa	I think its beautiful.    some middle name suggestions:    Julianna Grace*  Julianna Faith  Julianna Cait  Julianna Rae  Julianna Paige|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I love it Juliana Marie, Juliana Nicole. I love that name.|`|kcGFK36Waa	I like it alot. I personally just like Julianna with 2 n's better.|`|vwTyihvvaa	I love it!     I like it with the one "N" also.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I love it. One of the hosts of E! news has that name except spelled Guiliana. I personally love it. Your baby will probably end up getting called Julie though...hopefully you are okay with that haha.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Sure, why not?|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	It's cute like sharnold|`|QzBgeyKeaa	cute|`|QnSKaBcjaa	i like it|`|R1cey1Evaa	Really like it. For middle names try:  Juliana Paige  Juliana Madison  Juliana Riley|`|3paE1E9Xaa	too plain|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	It is one of my favorite names, but like Alyssa's mommy I prefer it spelled with 2 n's...Julianna|`|U8oR3VU6aa	I googled 'Juliana name etymology' and found this--I thought you might find it interesting so I used cut and paste. I like the name btw--but if I named my daughter Juliana, I'd want people to pronounce if correctly and not use nicknames. I have a very unusual name and it is always mispronounced, but I insist on using my name. (It isn't Jan btw)    The girl's name Juliana \j(u)-lia-na\ is pronounced joo-lee-AH-nah. It is of Latin origin, and its meaning is "youthful;  love's child". Feminine form of Julius or Julian. First used in the early Christian era. Saint Juliana of Florence (14th century). Also a royal name in the Netherlands. See also Julian, Gillian, Jillian, and Julie. Actresses Juliet Phillips, Juliet Moore, Julianne Margulies.    Juliana has 8 variant forms: Giuliana, Juliane, Juliann, Julianna, Julianne, Julieann, Julieanna and Juliean|`|j49IqTdiaa	i think it is a little different but different is good|`|29tiSHnnaa	i think its an okay name.|`|NmKu7VKTaa	I like that name. What will be the full name?      ks|`|VYgg5B2waa	i loooooooooove it!!|`|puOTqIBUaa	I think its pretty except it will probably be shortened to Julie. Which is fine but, its a little plain & common.|`|gLQGSfbRaa	I think it's cute. I work with special needs kids and there's a little girl named Juliann in there who calls herself Jules, so you could use that as a nickname. =]|`|f6YRNXGdaa	Its a pretty name, but you should probably go with something more like Julianne because she can decide on how she wants her nickname to be. and this way, you can still call her juliana :]]    congrats and hope i helped!! :]]|`|9O3prIUpaa	Juliana?  I really like it.  It's my best friends name. =)|`|XRzSxgUnaa	Is it joo-lee-on-uh or joo-lee-an-uh?     I like on-uh. very pretty|`|1LiAxvc7aa	its cute,,,|`|a5rKiHUqaa	NO NO NO NO NO AND GUESS WHAT NO    THAT GIRL WILL HATE YOU FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE IF YOU GIVE HER THAT|`|wziUVyVoaa	Very classic and elegant sounding. It's a good, unique, solid name that I'm sure your daughter will grow up to be proud of. It's very profound and sounds great when you say it out loud.    Juliana Reece  Juliana Peyton  Juliana Alexis  Juliana Riley  Juliana Courtney  Juliana Blake  Juliana Marie  Juliana Caroline  Juliana May  Juliana Leigh  Juliana Taylor  Juliana Jackelyn  Juliana Miana (pronounced MY-ANN-UH)  Juliana Amber  Juliana Brinny  Juliana Cady  Juliana Destiney  Juliana Emily  Juliana Hope  Juliana Haylee  Juliana Isabelle  Juliana Kacey  Juliana Nola  Juliana Price  Juliana Shae  Juliana Terra  Juliana Teai (pronounced TEE-UH)|`|cA3PAgetaa	I think Juliana sounds like a beautiful name for a girl =)|`|qxnxm0YLaa	Juliana is okay...it's more on the traditional side. I tend to like more unique & unisex names.|`|FrkF7PaRaa	It's pretty, but its sort of plain at the same time...idk, it just dosn't stick out to me.|`|Y5zFQZSgaa	It's a gorgeous name! It's very classy and unique.
4D1VEKW5aa	As soon as you miss your period. A dry dark period is no indication of pregnancy. If you want take the test in the morning on the 7th day, if you have missed the period, or experience only light brown spotting.|`|cjqOUq5xaa	After your expected period and with your first Morning pee!|`|YzCPY48qaa	they say the day your period is expected,but i didn't get my bfp until i was 2 days late.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	On the day your period is expected.|`|E9dGOVs0aa	i always take early pregnancy tests because i always can feel when i am pregnant for some reason. take it at any time during the day. you can take it up to 5 days before missing your period but the closer you are to missing your period the better..i always have faint faint lines but they are faint positives and i am pregnant. good luck
rdpZrBc9aa	Don't forget the one that teaches them to wake up and cry just as you're finally stepping into the shower!|`|HMRVyOwTaa	Idiot.|`|B2dQop3oaa	I highly doubt that. When in the womb the child is still undeveloped. It can _not_ understand any kind of language as it's brain is not yet capable of working with those signals.    Something that is possible is the fact that they remember sounds, which may explain why some babies get calmed by the music they also heard whilst being in the womb.    "They always put their arms in the air.." - They get somewhat thought that this is the sign for a parent to pick them up. This is due the fact that the parent will probably pick the child up when it's doing so at the first place.    My 2 cents.|`|AA10494763	We all have done this. Actually those are reflexes things inate in them if your child never does that there is actually a problem    Thanks for the laugh|`|1df31c9db3dcca4d09a9e2c45066a64caa	No.Children just develop naturally in the womb. That's their only "job".
44OH7Si6aa	Every parent has things they tolerate less than others. I hate whining and I hate it when kids can't go to bed without a huge production. My kids have been taught to put themselves to bed when I say it's bed time, many of my friends take over an hour to put their kids to bed. For me, their kids bedtime attitude would drive me crazy. I am sure there are things that I am more tolerant of with my kids that drive my friends nuts. Example, my son talks alot. He likes having conversations with grownups and I indulge him in that. My friends all have younger kids and I know it irritates them when my son tries to join in the grown up talk instead of playing with the others.   To a degree yes we are blind to some of our children's faults, especially when you only have one child. There are so many of my friends that brag about how mild mannered and quiet their little boy or little girl is at home. Of course he/she is quiet at home, there are only adults to play with, stick that kid in a room with 5 others his/her age and I guarantee you they'll kick and scream and act just like the rest of them. In order to really know if your kid is well behaved or behaves better than average, you would have to hear what other parents say about your kid when y'all aren't around. Other parents are the best critics of what you are doing wrong.|`|w5KFkyGRaa	yes all parents are blind when it comes to there children u just have to try to see past it.|`|DE0DJsdqaa	yes yall parents are!!!|`|dDVAUA9saa	Absolutely.  And brighter, talented, more intelligent, advanced, and kind.    Love is blind.|`|B2dQop3oaa	Somewhere.. somewhere seeing your child as "better" is a value that gives you a quality as a good parent: it means you love your children.    Of course, it's even better to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your child, and build on that together with it.    (( And in some cases make jokes about your bad things - like my old man does from time to time, if not always ^^. ))|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Of course the average parent is going to think that their kid is more extraordinary, but I try to temper myself with some realism. My kids aren't perfect and they are going to make mistakes  But it would make you a pretty crappy parent if you weren't your kids biggest fan!!|`|veO1RXrCaa	I try not to be "blind" to my sons misbehaviour.  Im not overly critical either.  I know he can be a little brat, I know he also can be one of the sweetest boys I have ever met.  I like to think we walk a fine line between perfect and monster.  I also would rather he have his nasty moments at home where no one else but us there to see them.  He once threw his coat in my face at beavers.  I was totally embarrassed bc one of the Dad's went "whoa" under his breath.  I grabbed his arm and quietly and sternly warned him.  I hate when he shows his nasty side when he has made the impression he is a nice boy.|`|Nti8czLvaa	I think somewhat everyone is.  But then there are the parents that when their kids act up do nothing about it.  I think my children are very well behaved, but as all children they have their moments and they get disciplined for it.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Blind...not exactly.  But "near sighted"...I think that applies.|`|3ERKIfqIaa	omg...that irritates me sooooooo bad when parents are like nooooooooooot my child...yeah right..those are the worst kids cause their parents let them get away with murder...my kid is pretty good buuuuuuuuuuuut he does like to get into a little trouble...boys will be boys...he is sooooooo grounded right now for playing with fire...and i am sooooooooo not in denial...he did it....and now he has no skateboard or outside privledges...his world has came to a halt....is this his normal behavior noooooo way...but it happens and when it does i dont sugarcoat it...get over it your kid can be a brat and mine can too.....|`|DcLXhtoLaa	We all love our children unconditonally so we really dont like to see their falts, we are all proud of our children and feel that they are the most special thing ever. thats how it should be, however, no child is totally perfect. children are all different I have 4 and they all have very different personalaties. I think the trick is to express how proud you are of your child without undermining somone elses child.|`|zcZGRPc2aa	I think some parents are. My mother wasn't, she would always have something to say about mine and my brothers behavior however the people who critized her for her parenting of us didn't see what their own teenagers were doing. I think it's just a matter of what parents consider to be wrong/right. Personally my mother-in-law is always saying how i flirt with other guys and everything even though all my guy friends are either gay or married and i don't consider it flirting however when my husband calls or emails other girls or when he used to invite them to our house while i was gone she wouldnt see he was doing wrong.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	just better behaved? aren't they smarter, stronger, and more beautiful, too? don't we all live in Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average?    love can make someone's faults seem smaller.  not that my children have any, of course.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Sometimes, there are those parents who's little Johnny or Mary will never do anything wrong.  These are usually the kids who end up in detention at school.|`|r07BwhO1aa	Yes all parents are (myself included) but in all honesty my daughter is a really good kid, and sometimes I think "wow, who got my kid cause you are waay too good"  Then again she is only 8 and we have not hit the teen years yet!!!  I bet she is saving all of her bad stuff for when she hits 16!!  AHHH|`|sP8KrvA7aa	I don't think all parents have no clue about their children. But if I have to draw from my own experience the answer would be yes, you are blind when it comes to your own children. When my mother speaks about me it's like she's talking about someone else. It pains me because all critics and insults that honestly hurt me. But at some point I realized that she just doesn't know me. Therefore her judgment when it comes to me is clouded.
5FhRoNVUaa	my parents don't treat me better.  my sister is like a queen to my parents.  if she does something bad my parents tell her don't do it again.  when i do something they get so pissed.  im finally moving out next year though.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Who said they do? You can only go by your family so this is a question you should be asking your own parents. But it doesn't sound like your ego was hurt too much, and you certainly aren't afraid to put your brother down for no apparent reason so I can venture a guess as to why they continue to treat him better.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Your family is not typical  I'm sorry you were abused, but that doesn't mean that all parents are like YOUR parents.     (I have 3 sisters and a brother. None of us were beaten or abused, and we were all treated with respect. We've all grown to be responsible, stable, emotionally healthy adults.)|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Well I don't think you have a good example in your home. My parents never treated my brother better and I don't treat my sons better. They are my kids and I love them all the same and treat them as fairly as I can.|`|dDVAUA9saa	You were unfortunate enough to have parents who were discriminatory, abusive and unfair.  And now, because of your experience, you are making generalizations about all parents that are not true.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i am sorry about that. not all parents are like that. i treat my son and daughter the same. they are both my world. parents that favor one kid over the other should get there kids took away. those are the bad parents. no kid should be treated better then the other kid. they are equal?|`|w5KFkyGRaa	its not always that way its just some parents.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	OH sweetie, that is so creul of them and unfair. I would of thought the same as you that twin girls were very very special.  I have  2 boys and 2 girls and I love them all.  I think parents parent differently ...boys and girls (maybe not consciously) with time (as we live and learn...kids dont come with parenting manuals so naturally your a different parent to the first born than the last born).  That way of thinking is old fashioned...that boys are better than girls when it came to farming and the agragarian cultures they just wanted sons to work the farm.  Now days I dont see taht mentality.  I think its just your parents. Im so sorry that they didnt nurture you and love you and make you feel special. Its going to hurt you a long time.  But you have a twin.  Not many of us do...so you got something very special going on for you!   It sounds like your grandma loved you very dearly too? !   Having a baby brother can be special too.  Its not his fault they favored him.  He needs you too. He will love his big sister very much if she gives him the opportunity.  I have a little brother and I wouldnt trade that relationship for anything.  take care. ANd remember, happiness and love are choices. You can choose to be hurt and you can choose to be angry...but youll waste alot of time and loose alot of time you could of been happy.  Take care and good luck .
WPI0Z47saa	If her gums are swollen and her mouth looks sore then maybe she is cutting teeth. If not then take her to the doctor to see what is irritating her mouth. Would you want to eat solids if your mouth hurt? That would also explain why she would be suddenly waking up in the middle of the night. She is probably clingy because she is so uncomfortable. If it is the teeth, she will eat when it feels better. My doctor told me to give my son yogart which is a meat substitute while his mouth hurt. Go back to baby foods if you have to until it passes so that she doesn't have to chew. When you notice that her mouth isn't as sore anymore then offer solid foods again. It is normal and she will be fine. I hope some od these suggestions helped.<br>  <br>  Children often act differently with others. Maybe your daughter is trying to eat for your aunt which ends up making her mouth sore so by the time you get home she doesn't want to eat anymore. But you will find that they do act differently with others. My son gives me a hard time cleaning up his toys but if he is over anyone elses house, he does it on his own and is on his best behavior. Drives me nuts. Also with food I told my dad that he doesn't like sandwiches since he NEVER eats them no matter what I do. But he does for him with no problem. He doesn't even think twice about it. Kids are weird sometimes lol.|`|ETsUQa0kaa	Maybe she eats with her aunt because her aunt lets her eat while she eats. Do you? She may eat if she sees someone else is eating. Also, if you do, it might just be one of those 1 year old ways. Hope this helps!|`|dwdLkvgPaa	well don't chase her around trying to get her to eat she will not go hungry she will eat when she gets hungry....she is probably getting some more teeth...just feed her whatever she WILL eat and go from there...as long as she is not losing weight she is fine...if she keeps going on like this just ask your DR....I am sure that she is fine...as for being clingy its her age...My 15 month old is the same way...she probably thinks it is a game with you and not with your aunt...

c73QkZ2haa	Ya i do find that odd. But maybe they dont have a community outreach program in your area.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Well, instead of trying churches why not go to your local shelters. That way you're cutting out the "middle man" and giving directly to those that need it.    You could also try posting on Freecycle or Craigslist(in their free section).|`|AA10624857	I don't find it odd at all.  Many churches do not have the volunteer base nor the space to accept, store, sort, and distribute clothing or other donated items.  You should look in your phone book under churches to find one listed that has a clothing ministry associated with it.  There are also probably out reach ministries listed if you look under social services.  We have a very active, large church, but we don't provide our own clothing ministry.  Instead, we support financially, as well as with donations of items, a non profit organization in our community that provides multiple resources to people in need.  You can also look in your yellow pages for crisis pregnancy centers who usually welcome donations of gently used baby items.  Try looking under Abortion Alternatives for crisis pregnancy centers.  Most individual churches do not have their own out reach ministry for clothing or other household items.|`|siDcjgJCaa	That is kind of odd... we donate to a womans and childrens shelter. Or there is a childrens consignment store that will buy back some of our stuff.. we use those too.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	That is so weird!|`|YL8tTemwaa	It is kinda wierd. But not all churches HAVE to do it.  Look arround, you'll find a place to give those clothes.|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	I don't think it's weird, really...  Churches generally aren't built with a lot of storage space for all kinds of donated things.  They are known for helping people out spiritually, and can guide people who are in need to places where they can find their necessities, but they don't store them at the church.  Find a local shelter - they will surely take them!
lXE75yQjaa	You can try the Hylands teething tablets. Kinda sounds like more than teeth to me though. The only thing that I found that ever really helped was Tylenol or Motrin.|`|rAkWoweOaa	I think the lump is normal. Have you tried Wyler's teething tablets? You can get them at Walgreens, and CVS if you are in the USA.|`|7kosr9mcaa	About the teething...there are these things made for babies...they hold them and they have a mesh bag on the end...put some frozen or refrigerated cold fruit in the mesh bag and let him chew! That way he gets the fruit juices and the sweet taste.  You can buy them at walmart.    about the hard lump from his shots..completely normal. it is a bit painful for them but not too bad. my son gets that too.|`|AA10390690	My daughter never liked the cold wash clothes, however she LOVED to chew on the warm wash clothes, try that? You can also give him some tylenol or motrin to help ease his pain a bit. I used teething tablets && orajel as well. LIFE SAVERS! I gave my daughter a little bit of a frozen popcycle too. OH and she LOVED to eat her fruit baby food COLD =] And yes it is normal to have a lump. My daughter had a lump with her six mth shots for quiet a while.|`|AWqGmJUxaa	i have found this great thing called midsel and you can get in the shop now it work great and its a bit like capol but stronger and you can gave it your little one from the ages of 3 months|`|LqLs6otzaa	If he had shots, that's probably what's giving him the discomfort.  Call his pediatrician and talk to them.   That's what they are there for, and you'll get professional advice for your baby.|`|UgX5WeGPaa	the night time Oregel works great for Ayden.      actually used it the other night cause he's getting his back teeth and my poor lil man has been mizzy too...|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Wow I know how this goes my little one is 6 months old too and getting both bottom teeth in at once and he is always crabby I try everything also, I have given orajel for Minor relief for a while but now it seems to be not working, I have tried teething tablets and they also don't do the trick. I give mine teething rings that are cold and that doesn't seem to work either. He is okay if I give him some Tylenol but I can't keep doing that all the time either just like you said. I would like to see other people's answers because it's so difficult. It will get better soon I have hope for both of our little ones LOL. In the mean time all you can do is make sure he is fed, changed and try to make him happy.|`|OPhMTPqyaa	My youngest daughter has been the hardest to please while she's been teething. She won't take teething rings, A cold wash cloth or anything. She also hates the feel of anything that numbs her teeth for medications.    It might sound a bit odd at first but It's the only thing that works for my daughter. Try washing a carrot or celery very well, Cut the ends off and let him chew on it. When it starts to go soft then throw away and wash up another one and do the same.    Good luck and take care|`|nNRMOITEaa	try humphreys teething tablets i never had to use cause my son only had one night of pain well more like maybe a half hour but ui would use orajel but everyone would tell me use humphreys it wouldn't hurt to try. yea i dont like giving my son meds either he's never had tynenol or motrin etc just orajel that one day.    good luck hun|`|ZRNlwu5laa	Hylands teething tablets    Massage her gums with your fingertip, if he lets you ' many babies enjoy this, and it helps to ease the pain.     Natural version clove oil - Do research on how to administer     Good Luck    **EDIT**  About the lump from the shots.... A small red lump is normal. If it is acompanied by a fever or rash I would contact your pediatrician. They will normally give you a sheet of what to watch for after they get their shots. You can call the office and have them go over with you what to watch for.|`|qSmCA82Aaa	My daughter is going thru the same thing.  Last week she got 4 teeth in at once and last night a new one started breaking thru and she was screaming!  And just like your she didn't want anything - I tried the teething tablets but they didn't do anything for her, BUT right as I rubbed some baby orajel on her gums she quit crying with in a minute and fell sound asleep!     Oh and I also noticed that infants motrin works way better than tylenol for teething because it helps reduce inflamation.  Try alternating the two|`|EL3P7YA4aa	Well what i do with my daughter...is  try giving him some baby orajel and maybe  i know it sounds weird!! lol..but if you get  some beer or something put a little on your finger  and give it to him it helps take the pain away..  i haven't tried it but everyone tells me to do that..  but i do orajel and it works great!|`|1SlD1kZ2aa	you can try giving him teething tablets, or maybe sucking on a popsicle?  i have given my son motrin a few times when his pain was really bad.|`|KAqqAMAsaa	teething tablets help a lot! they sell it at the regular supermarkets and disolve in mouth...|`|n6XYYyoLaa	lump on leg is probably normal depending on the shots he received, i would however call the doc and ask if it is ok and when u should expect it to go down...  teething; your baby is old enough for motrin which also helps with pain, but it is also an anti-inflammatory which may also help the pain by decreasing swelling and irritation...if  u know your baby's current weight you could probably get the correct dose from a pharmacist; otherwise when you talk to the doc, ask them what dose is appropriate for your little guy...  my dd has always hated teethers, rags, etc...only thing i have found that helps her until her tylenol or motrin kicks in is frozen apple juice chunks in a mesh feeder that she can chew on and release ice cold apple juice to help numb up the gum....and oragel doesn't work for us either, she always manages to lick it off my finger before i can get to the gum, but it is a quick fix that doesn't last long, so i think the apple juice works at least as well...gl, hth  if he is particularly uncomfortable, ask your doc about rotating tylenol and motrin a time or two until u can get him comfortable, and i know you don't want to dope your baby, and i can understand that, but if you can get the pain med in him before it gets so severe, it will be able to give him more relief; it's harder to get a handle on once it gets really bad...|`|mjlhZAVxaa	I used those Munchkin Fresh Food Savers (you can find them at Target) and put an icecube in them and let him suck on it.  My mom swears that a little bit on lemon juice on their gums gets the teeth to pop out faster (I never did this).  Also, I don't know about the lump.  My niece had one after her shots and it went away in a day or two.  My son never had one though.   You could maybe give him an icey pop, it is sweet and very cold.  But I don't know if you want to give your 6 month old all that sugar!  I think they make baby ones, but I am not sure on the sugar content of those either! lol
rAkWoweOaa	I guess it is the same as those toddlers you see with a bottle or pacifier in their mouths when the mother knows they should be weaned already, only it is more disturbing to see a breast in the mouth of a child that old. Here comes the thumbs down, but whatever.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I don't understand that whole immunity issue. Working with young children, breast and formula fed, I have seen just as many, if not more sick breastfed children than formula. I don't really feel that is an issue after infancy. That is an opinion from experience.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	Since doctors recommend giving toddlers milk, it's obviously good for them after a year.  Why not give them milk that was made for them instead of milk made for a baby cow?  It's not normal that we drink the milk of another animal, and most people would be grossed out if you suggested they drink a dog's milk, for example, but no one has a problem with cow's milk because everyone does it.  If more people gave their kids human milk, perhaps it would be considered just as normal.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	First of all, babies cannot drink cows milk until they are 1 yr old,, so there is Nothing questionable about brestfeeding until a year.. after a year you should consider that breast milk is meant for human babies, if the baby can have that over  cows milk, go for it! Cows milk has Nothing on breastmilk as far as nutritian goes.   You might want to ask yourself why are you knocking it right here right now in the first place... seems you are trying to begin a debate so you can feel right.  Don't identify who you are with your opinions... becaue you will argue with everyone for you entiere life then.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Note that when you read these position statements, most of them say **AT LEAST** one year- that's a minimum. I for one want to do more than the minimum for my child. <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/prepare/bf-benefits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/prepare...</a><br>  <br>  The American Academy of Family Physicians Position Paper on Breastfeeding <br>  "Breastfeeding should ideally continue beyond infancy, but this is currently not the cultural norm and requires ongoing support and encouragement. Breastfeeding during a subsequent pregnancy is not unusual. If the pregnancy is normal and the mother is healthy, breastfeeding during pregnancy is the woman's personal decision. If the child is younger than two years of age, the child is at increased risk of illness if weaned. Breastfeeding the nursing child after delivery of the next child (tandem nursing) may help to provide a smooth transition psychologically for the older child." <br>  <br>  So, if you wean before 2 years your child is at risk. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/bfextended/ebf-benefits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/bfextended/eb...</a><br>  Breastfeeding benefits toddlers and young children...<br>  nutritionally, immunilogically and psychologically.<br>  <br>  Nursing toddlers benefit NUTRITIONALLY <br>  Nursing toddlers are SICK LESS OFTEN <br>  Nursing toddlers have FEWER ALLERGIES <br>  Nursing toddlers are SMART <br>  Nursing toddlers are WELL ADJUSTED SOCIALLY <br>  Nursing a toddler is NORMAL <br>  MOTHERS also benefit from nursing past infancy <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/bfextended/ebf-myths.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/bfextended/eb...</a><br>  MYTH: Breastfeeding a child older than a year is no different than breastfeeding a young infant. <br>  FACT: Nursing frequency and duration varies widely from child to child after the first year. As time passes, and as the nutritional aspects of breastfeeding become less significant, the comfort aspect of breastfeeding becomes much more significant. Children also incorporate breastfeeding into their play, which can add a new dimension to the breastfeeding relationship.<br>    <br>   <br>  MYTH: Mother’s milk becomes less nutritious after the first year. <br>  FACT: Mother’s milk continues to provide substantial amounts of nutrients well beyond the first year. At some point your baby will need to take in nutrients from other sources, but mother’s milk remains a valuable contribution to your child’s diet.<br>     <br>  MYTH: The immunities in mother’s milk are insignificant after the first few months. <br>  FACT: The immunities in mother’s milk continue as long as nursing continues, and some of the immunities increase in concentration as baby moves toward weaning. Children who are breastfed have fewer illnesses and illnesses of shorter duration than their non-nursing peers. The American Academy of Family Physicians notes that children weaned before two years of age are at increased risk of illness.<br>     <br>  MYTH: Extended breastfeeding makes a child overly dependent and can cause psychological harm. <br>  FACT: On the contrary, meeting a child’s need for breastfeeding fosters independence on the child’s own developmental timetable. Both research and the experiences of mothers worldwide indicate that children who nurse past a year have excellent social adjustment. Per the American Academy of Pediatrics, “There is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychologic or developmental harm from breastfeeding into the third year of life or longer.”<br>     <br>  MYTH: Mothers who breastfeed past infancy have not learned other ways of comforting their child. <br>  FACT: For the typical extended breastfeeding mother, breastfeeding is only one of many tools in her parenting toolkit.<br>     <br>  MYTH: Mothers only continue breastfeeding past infancy for their own benefit. <br>  FACT: A child will not breastfeed if he does not have a need to do so. A mother typically continues breastfeeding because her child is not ready to wean, and because of the continuing health and emotional benefits to her child.<br>     <br>  MYTH: Breastfeeding mothers need to wean for fertility to return. Breastfeeding during pregnancy is not safe. <br>  FACT: Most mothers can get pregnant while continuing breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is considered compatible with a healthy pregnancy.<br>     <br>  MYTH: The longer you breastfeed, the harder it will be to wean. <br>  FACT: Age has much less to do with ease of weaning than does your child's developmental readiness for weaning. Each child has his own developmental timeline for child-led weaning. If mom initiates weaning, then the closer the child is to weaning on his own, the easier it will be (for both mom and child) to accelerate this natural progression. If the child takes the lead in weaning, then this is not an issue at all. <br>  <br>  <br>  Nursing longer helps reduce the risk of many illnesses for mom and child.<br>  <a href="http://www.promom.org/101" rel="nofollow">http://www.promom.org/101</a><br>  <br>  **EDIT** I'm not seeing "chit" talking ;-) so perhaps you're reading into things a bit (though misquoting would drive me nuts).

However my health visitor was lovely about and didn't judge not like some mums.<br>  <br>  I think people like to continue after 12 months because of various reasons and that's up to them, but i dont think i would have done plus i am going back to work full time when my son is 8 months.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your little one X|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Breastfeeding doesn't magically stop being beneficial to mother and baby as soon as the baby hits a year.  There are benefits beyond one year.  So some women continue to breastfeed in order to get those benefits.  Also, some babies and mothers aren't ready to wean just because the baby turns one.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  It has to happen when the time is right for them, whether that's at 15 months or 5 years.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Breastmilk continues to be a healthy, nutritious food, and provides valuable immunities to baby for as long as mother opts to provide it.<br>  <br>  And breastfeeding continues to be an important source of comfort and bonding. <br>  <br>  It isn't 'necessary' to breastfeed for any length of time, but that doesn't mean that it's harmful either.  Allowed to self-wean, most children do so around 2 or 3, but a few will nurse until 4 or 5, and that's perfectly ok. If the mother was uncomfortable, she would encourage weaning. <br>  <br>  Why do you think that 'talking' equals 'too old?'  What is the connection?  Some babies are talking at 9 or 10 months, yet every reliable source recommends nursing for at LEAST a year -- and no reliable source gives a maximum.<br>  <br>  EDIT: BTW, there is no reason a formula fed baby can't have formula after a year.  It's just that most moms opt to wean around that time becuase they CAN, and because formula is so expensive. Breastmilk is free.
T3BXC8qXaa	Kind, nice and offer constructive criticism when he needs it. I read somewhere years ago that when your child becomes a teen, you become less of a manager and more of a consultant. That made total sense to me. He knows our values, he knows what we expect from him. It's now up to him to make good choices so we give him some space. He also knows that he will probably make mistakes and when he does, we'll be here for him.     I expect our attitudes to help him become a confident, independent person who shares our values and goes on to live a happy and productive life. :)|`|B2dQop3oaa	My parents treat me well. From time to time I get a spank or a whack, and I'm happy with that. There is NO real way to show an infant that it did something wrong but physical punishment. I'm not talking "beat their teeth" out kind of violence, I'm talking about a smack or a slap across the face.    My "old folks" are very friendly people, however my mother tends to get enraged so fast about so small matters - kind of bugs me.    They criticize us, in a good way: it's constructive criticism which we can use for further decision and actions.    Ps: Religion and Tokio Hotel, Jonas Brothers, McDonals makes your children bad human beings.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	We have consistent fair rules. They are allowed to participate but final decision is ours.  We respect them and they are allowed to disagree with us.  We know they have to make their own choices and learn their own way.  So we choose our battles.  For ex. even if we hated it how they wear their hair is their choice.  Now belly button piercings come under the "as long as you live in my house you cant" rule.  I think it is importatnt to cuddle and hug no matter the age. I use please and thank you with them.  They do too.    I think the teenage years are exciting and fun. They can be hard too so its important to be patient and kind hearted.   go to youtube and google the song Find your wings.|`|2ywzcoVqaa	When my kids were both teens I treated them with respect.

0VJE7BXmaa	It sounds like she has quite an imagination!  I would suggest to be very fearless in front of her.  Show her by modeling a confident and fearless attitude.  And give her power.  For example, well, if there's mean wolves in there we will just hit them with a hammer.  Have a toy hammer for her, so that when she is afraid she can pretend to hit them.  Say, let's get our hammer ready, and we will peek in there to make sure there's no wolves.  You could also give her a little flashlight.  You could also say, if there are mean wolves in there, we will scream really loud and scare them all away!  Just be really enthusiastic and theatrical.  I think she's being a bit silly, and if you play along, but at the same time show her how she can face her fears, it will help her.  I've seen my husband use some tricks with a little boy who was afraid of our dog.  I thought it was hopeless, but he taught the little boy how to protect himself and chase the dog with a toy lawn mower and the boy started chasing the dog and laughing.  Now, he plays with the dog all of the time.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	My daughter is the same age.  What we do - if they are in the car, I roll down the window and throw them out.  Sometimes I eat them.  Sometimes we "bam" them (she pretends to hit them), sometimes she shows them her muscles. I empower her to be stronger and tougher than monsters or whatever it is that scares her.  We tell them to "stop! go away!"  sometimes we do Doraesq things like "no monsters allowed!"    I try and give my daughter the ability to "save" herself from what she thinks is scary.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Isn't that weird how out of no where that starts?  My son swears there is a ghost at my parents house (maybe there is...maybe there isn't) but he went through a phase where he was afraid of EVERYTHING and everything had "bugs" in it. I think it will pass but go to Barnes and Noble and ask the lady or man in the child book section. They have a lot of books, I'm sure they have something! The barenstein bears have to have something on that subject if anything.   Good Luck :)|`|jUBHGKf2aa	My daughter who is now 27 had many fears also. She is now a very self- reliant person who has a degree is social work. My best advice is too not let her give in to her fears.  When you do , she will think there is a reason for her fear. Go with her to get her socks etc.,don't give up. I used to give my daughter a magic sucker(dumdums) to get her through the bad times.Whatever works right? I think there is a tremendous amount you can do. Is she controlling you by her behavior? She may be trying to do that. Be strong!Why did you take her to the indoor play ground if she didn't want to go? Be forceful and not coddling. That's my advice for what its worth.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	my 7-year old son (highly imaginative and creative ADD boy) wrote a book about his personal fears.  it's entitled MY SCARY BEDROOM THINGS.  i'll try and send you a copy. :)  in his story, his socks turn into snakes, his books turn into bats, his shoes turn into rats --but then he turned himself into a wizard and popped all the scary things back to normal with a swish of his magic wand (which is actually his hairbrush).  lol!  your daughter seems to be just as imaginative.  why not tell her that she's not just a little girl but a super hero who can zap all the mean wolves away? you can play-act the fight scene with her.  it should be fun for both of you.  worth a shot, right?|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	sounds like you are doing a good job by having her see a therapist.  Continue to be realistic and talk about what is real and not real.  What also worked for us when the kids were young is that my husband told my son to wait with Mommy while he went through the house and captured all the "monsters & scary things" and threw them out in the garbage.  Husband must go to garbage can, let child hear the noise of door and garage and all that.  Then the next day when the garbage is being picked up, take her to the window and say, let's wave bye bye to all the monsters and scary things!    Then you only have to remind her if it comes up again, that the house is safe because Daddy threw them out.....    Good Luck|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Therapy is exellent . Be supportive and loving. Do you know the source of her fears? That may help you in figuring out what you can do to help.|`|AA11616628	Well it seems she may have seen scary movies or something...try taking her to the drawer and shoew her that their isent ant alligators in it...Tell her that you killed all the wolves and they will never bother her again...hope all works out for you...|`|v065DMvtaa	This is normal for a 3yr old to have fears. She needs most of all, to feel secure by those around her. Don't dismiss her fears- to her they are real, and scary. Just love her and help her to understand that you are there to protect her and she is safe.Maybe let her know that you have things that scare you too- spiders or whatever they might be. If she knows that Mommy sometimes is afraid of things then maybe she'll understand it's okay to be afraid sometimes. Everyone gets scared.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Just let her grow out of it and be sure to reasure her.  My son had a ton of irrational fears...at that age his biggest one was that he'd get sucked down the drain in the tub when we let the water out...he would scream...shake, push away from the drain and completely believed he was goin down...but then one day...it just stopped and it's been that way with all his fears.|`|YvNOfM2xaa	You could get a little spray bottle and say It it is monster spray and immediently the monsters will be gone, and most likely never some back again.     You should make a book with all of your daughters fears and it ends up that all the animals only want to be her friend. ?     Good luck!|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	We are going through something similar with our 3 year old daughter only its dinosaurs that are gonna eat her.      The two things that have worked the best for us:  We taped a sign up to her door that says "No dinosaurs allowed".  When she gets scared we remind her about the sign and tell her they can't get into her room.(plus a million discussions about how they are extinct, etc.)    Her older brother performs dinosaur checks for her where he goes through all her drawers and toy box to check for dinosaurs and then reports back that its all clear.      Both of these worked for us.  My sis has used "monster" spray.  An air fresherner with a homemade label claiming it eliminated monsters.  It worked with her kids.
o2ehEqinaa	I'm 31 weeks and still no symptoms!  At the beginning I had some minor headaches and felt tired all the time but that was it.  I now just pee a lot, but that's partly because I'm so far along and she's pushing on my bladder and I'm drinking a lot more these days!  I have to admit I love having no bad symptoms - it's made this experience wonderful and I have great energy about everything.  But I have to admit it scared me in the earlier stages (first trimester) because I didn't know if my body was adjusting to the baby inside and I feared having another miscarriage!  But all is great and our little girl is healthy...and so am I.  I'd just be grateful you have no symptoms and enjoy every minute of your pregnancy!  Congratulations!<br>  I agree - The ultrasounds are the best part!|`|C8E3fe3xaa	At the beginning of my pregnancy my only symptoms were peeing alot and i felt tired all the time.. then around week 10-12 i started getting a little morning sickness but it went away after week 13, and the only symptoms i've had since then are still peeing alot and sore breasts. I try not to worry since my doctor says everything is going good so far but sometimes i just can't help but to worry.|`|XGQpERs3aa	What you just mentioned are pregnancy symptoms but I do know  what you are trying to say.  I have all the above but no more except I have to sleep on my side and I have always been a stomach sleeper.  Anyway I am not worried cause my mother and my sister and my aunts said they never had any symptoms no vomiting or anything and if it weren't for their growing stomachs they wouldn't know they were pregnant. So the fact that I am not having morning sickness or much of anything wasn't a surprise to me.  Beware though you may get more symptoms soon.  Even in your second trimester new ones may start.  Good Luck!!!|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	With first 2 babies I had little to no symptoms. Just like you.  I was pretty happy. I was pretty busy during my day to day so it was nice that I didn't have to be in the bed sick or anything. WIth this pregnancy I have nearly every symptom imaginable and am not even used to it. I do my best to go about my daily duties but I am tired allot and just want to go home and to bed. First 2 were girls so maybe this one is a boy! :)

Heres a web site with some    http://www.myblankets.com/Taggies.html    EDIT - Y the thumbs down?? some people have too much time on their hands.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	My sister was the same way, even as an older toddler.  She had a favorite stuffed toy and she would rub the tag between her fingers as a soothing method.  Eventually the tag would wear out, so my mom was always cutting the tags off other things and sewing them on to the stuffed animal.  It is funny to tease her about it now that she's married.|`|AA10167940	Yes.  She loves them.  She will spend 15-20 minutes fiddling around with them-|`|p2Njf5gBaa	LOL, yes, my son loves tag, the tag on his boppy has been his favorite for the past 6 months.  But any tag on anything is a hit!    The funny thing is, that we received a tag blanket as a gift, and he wants nothing to do with it.  He only likes tags on other items.|`|AA10390690	YES. my daughter LOVES to do that and has since about 3mths old (she'll be 1 in march) i always found it funny. we could get her a brand new toy or something and as soon as she sees the tag, bam she's happier than ever lol. it's cute
igrBSm4Uaa	I looove it =D    It sounds french without being unreadable.    It sounds like a young girl, maybe teenager.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think it is okay.
PjzJ9QQRaa	My son used to do that too, and I just let him cry.  It was harder on me than it was on him.  Each time it would work, he would be more persistant next time.  But once I decided enough is enough, he followed suit shortly after.  I guess he figured out that it would do him no good, and he was only hurting himself.  Babies are smarter than most people think.  She most likely is too angry at the injustice of being laid down to notice that her belly hurts, so it is probable that it has little to do with her fits.      But, if you just can't bear letting her cry it out, then try letting her lay beside you on the couch while you read a book or watch a movie.  Get her used to falling asleep on her own, without the rocking.  Once she does that with ease, then move on to laying her in her crib to go to sleep.      Remember not to let her set the patterns, you are the mom, and you know what is best.  Do what is best for both of you, no matter how she feels about it-and that goes for all ages!|`|qhOWBJXyaa	I was about to say to just toss her in & go, but all that from laying her down? Yeesh. I don't know what to tell you. I'm a new momma too, but I took the "you're on your own" route & tossed him in bed from the get go. *shrugs* I have no idea! Sorry! I would say put her in bed, sit by the bed & slowly move the chair towards the door. I don't know what that method is called, but it seems like it may help. Maybe she'll slowly start to fall asleep with you there, then eventually not need you anymore. Good luck, momma! :) At least now you know next time around, 'eh?|`|n6XYYyoLaa	personally, i used what i call fussing it out...i put her in her crib, got her comfy, gave passy, etc..patted a few times and left...she has a fan and a womb bear for white noise...if she was fussing/crying etc, i would go in every few mins and give her back her passy pat her and leave; if she was really wound up, i would pat her a couple mins to calm her and leave....you CANNOT give in once or you will be three steps behind where you were...after a day or so she rarely makes a peep and goes right to sleep; i never left her more than a few mins, never let her just cry hysterically while i ignored her, etc..but once she was down in the crib, that was it, no getting back up until after sleep ; and when you go back in, don't talk, make eye contact etc...i would make a shhh sound if she was really upset, but that was it..if she is just fussing, i would put her passy back, couple of pats and leave....you just have to be tough and persistent bc is she knows u will eventually cave, she will go at it for hours  bc she will think she runs the show....i am against just straight crying it out, but i don't think my method was inhumane in the least....

se3RwEWyaa	Yes! Luteal phase lasts from ovulation until your next AF.  While estrogen dominates the pre-ovulatory, follicular phase of your cycle, progesterone dominates the post-ovulatory, LUTEAL PHASE of your cycle. Before ovulation, progesterone is present only in very small amounts. After ovulation (luteal phase), progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum (the remains of the ovarian follicle after ovulation), and is present in dramatically higher amounts. Progesterone plays the following roles:   Progesterone makes the lining of your uterus soft and spongy so that a fertilized egg can latch onto it and implant.   Progesterone is needed to support and sustain pregnancy.   Progesterone causes your Basal Body Temperature (BBT) to rise after ovulation so that it is measurable with a BBT thermometer.   Progesterone causes your BBT to stay elevated throughout pregnancy. Your Leutal Phase will last from confirmed Ovulation until conception or you AF begins. The rise progesterone levels marks confirmed Ovulation. Lots of luck and baby dust****|`|f5pticCLaa	The luteal phase, also referred to as 'days past ovulation' or 'DPO', is the part of the cycle that starts at ovulation and ends the day before your next period. It usually lasts about 14 days and does not vary by more than a day in each person. The luteal phase is named after the corpus luteum (Latin: "yellow body"), a structure that grows on the surface of the ovary where a mature egg was released at ovulation. The corpus luteum produces progesterone in preparing the body for pregnancy. Your luteal phase must be at least 10 days long to support pregnancy.
61f146aa35efa267168674226729b181aa	hi..i have PCOS too since i was 14 and now im 24...clomid and metformin is the first line of treatment for women who have PCOS and are TTC..they will going to start you at the lowest dose w/c is 50 mg. and they will going to monitor u via U/S to check if you have maturing follicle. If at 50 mg. u didn't conceive, the following month they will going to titrate the dosage from 50 to 100 mg. and same protocol again w/ monitoring. If you didn't conceive again, they will titrate the dosage from 100 to 150 mg. Your highest dosage will be up to 200 mg. only. If you haven't conceive within this safe dosage then clomid doesn't works for you and your OB will refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist bcoz they are the one who can further evaluate your situation. These RE (reproductive endocrinologist) will evaluate your reaction with clomid and this time around they will going to prescribe you to do fertility injectibles-> GONAL F for example (fertility injectibles has a higher chance of pregnancy rathern than clomid) and besides fertility injectible doesn't affect your CM (cervical mucus)..Clomid is well known for its side effect of drying your CM so u might want to use Robitussin (to produce fertile quality mucus) or preseed (mimics your cervical mucus)..preseed is known for success rate of helping women to get pregnant (the first time we tried it w/ combination of fertility injectibles + intercourse + metformin i got pregnant)...Goodluck on your TTC journey!|`|6igjX2cnaa	If everything is perfect than you have a 15-20% chance of pregnancy.  That's the normal rate in a person without PCOS.  Good luck hun! I too have PCOS and hoping that this cycle is the one!! :)  Best wishes!|`|Y9GdwvnWaa	well i had the same problem(wasnt ovulation on my own) and this was my 1st cycle on clomid also. I went to the doctor to do an ultrasound to see and their we 2 mature egg follicles present. so im praying at least one of them attaches! i know this didnt exactly answer your question but hope i helped in some way.
K6KeN7sgaa	You can add SPINACH to a million different recipes and they'll never even know it's in there!    Make homemade pizza and add spinach at the last minute to the SAUCE, and only cook it for 3 -5 minutes in the saucepan before you spread it on the crust.     I think if you just spend 20 minutes or so looking for good, tasty, spicy recipes you'll be flabbergasted at the variety of dishes made with vegetables.      http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes-and-c...    http://www.easy-kids-recipes.com/easy-re...    http://www.articlealley.com/article_5941...

Put a small helping on their plates, and if they ask you what it is, name it something whimisical, fantastical, imaginative and say, "So-and-so gave me this recipe for Dragon's Beard and I've been DYING to try it out!" And then immediately start talking about the weather or a newspaper article you just read or the movie you're all going to this weekend.    TAKE THE FOCUS OFF THE FOOD.

Here are a few tips to help u encourage a pregnancy though  Most women conceive around day12-16 of their cycle (counting the first day of your period as day 1)  Lying on your back with ur partner on top of u may help also....after he has ejaculated lay flat on your back for a while 20 mins-half an hour.....if ur flexible put ur legs in the air!  make sure u have a healthy balanced diet and u do moderate exercise....women who are under or overweight find it very hard to conceive  lastly, try not to stress, stress effects your reproductive system and hormones more than u can imagine. Relax and enjoy sex|`|49We7buoaa	Yes I used ovulation predictor kits but I did a whole method to detect ovulation....I got pregnant the first month we tried!!!    Get an online ovulation calculator (www.webmd.com is the best tells the length of your cycles)    I bought ovulation predictor kits to make sure the online calculator was accurate    The best and easiest way for me to detect ovulation was to check my cervix it was always 100% accurate.|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	I used the Answer brand strips from Walmart. You could buy about 20 of them for 18 bucks and since my cycles were so off, it was nice to have a large amount of strips to test every day, not just the 2 or 3 days I thought I might be ovulating. I used them for 4 months and they always gave me my ovulation dates and were very helpful to determine "when" to have sex during the month.    On our 6th month of trying, we were getting too stressed about the whole thing, so we decided to relax, no tests, no tracking of temps, no fertility websites, just to have alot of sex and BOOM, it worked. We are now pregnant. So I didn't technically use the tests that month, but the several months leading up to that were great in determining when I ovulated, which was MUCH sooner than we thought. I would recommend them, but do yourself a favor and follow the directions to a T. Don't take them in the morning, don't drink water 2 hours before you take them, and most test strips expire about 30 days after you open the air-tight case, so don't buy them in bulk.

s4LWmcTjaa	Oh yeah.  It's a big stink here.  I just try to leave it alone unless I see something that is just too stupid to ignore (example:  spanking causes sexual fetishes.... RIDICULOUS).<br>  <br>  *Amen Carrie!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, bad old habits die hard and spanking kids along with formula feeding as okay and equal to breast needs to find a grave and crawl in.   Seriously.   Sure folks argue about it, it's an ingrained idea that it's okay and needs to be torn out like a rotten tooth or a melanoma....   It just takes time, just like it takes time for folks to come to the realization that domestic violence is not okay and it is our business or that alcoholism affects everyone....|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Yeah it's a big debate and it's so overplayed, too.<br>  Actually any debate that bashes another parent's choice is overplayed.|`|j2mRop0laa	Yes that's a popular one. I only answer those questions from my contacts, though, because otherwise I see a lot of people asking just to get people all riled up.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!<br>  <br>  It's been quiet for a few days!

bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	This is what I've heard children are better on their birthdays and get diffecult around there half birthays. My son is turning 3 on monday and I'm still waiting for that turn around. Also my son is starting to get an imagination so he plays better by himself but I still have to talk him in to it.|`|AZKbXXrvaa	It sounds like your son is struggling with your living situation as much as you are. All you can do for now is carry on being firm with him and explaining why he shouldnt do certain things and sticking with what you say. Once you have your own place you will start to be able to discipline properly again.  None of my sons had a big turnaround at 3 or any other age but they change all the time and pick up on your stress too which is probably what is happening with both your kids right now.  If once you move to your own place and have had time to settle in, your son's behaviour doesnt settle, it could be worth having him assessed to rule out any developmental problem as the second year can be when these things become apparent. Im talking about autistic spectrum disorder particularly because this is what happened with my elder son who has this problem. Im not saying your son has this tho its just something to rule out if things dont settle down.   Good luck its not an easy time for any of you. Hope all is well|`|bDDGGVGHaa	Its ok. that is what's supposed to happen because they can talk and their trying to that they are getting older and more cranky.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Sounds to me like your rules/consequences are not working and he has it figured out and is running the roost so to speak.  You need to work on 3 strikes and your out-    1. Warn him sternly. Get down on his level and remove the object or situation and tell him "Mommy said NO. That could (break, you could get hurt, etc..)".    2. If he does it again TIME OUT. Plop his fanny down on a bench or spot for 1 minute his age- 3 minutes is fine at this point.   Tell him why he is there and get an apology at the end of the time out. If he gets up, put him back until he stays and it will get easier.    3. If he does it yet again a couple of well placed swats on his fanny and a firm "Mommy said no because ____".  Once or twice of this and he'll straighten up.    As for acting out in the store or restaraunts maybe enforcing manners you expect at home before going out will help. Let him know before you leave home AND when you arrive before you get out of the car that he will hold your hand, sit nicely in the cart (if shopping) and he will not act up or else he will get a time out in the store.  Use a bench, chair or even a quiet corner in a store to do time out in public. Take him to the bathroom if needed to do it. If he acts up after that then take him home and return later to do your errand.  The next time you go out, leave him home with a sitter and make it clear that until he can behave in public with you he can't come.  The next time you go out after that, take him along and again, enforce what you expect and tell him.      If you don't get a little firmer at this age of defiance then he will continue to act out and walk over you.  Even at 3 kids will get labelled as "that kid"for his behavior by preschool teachers, sitters and other onlookers and once that happens it's a hard label to get rid of.      I do this stuff with my 2 year old and trust me, it works. He doesn't act out in public places, he knows how to mind and do what is asked when we tell him something.  We don't mind taking him places because he knows where we are going and what is expected of him.
lmgbsbwbaa	I started this countdown thing from 10 to 1 with my son at the age of 2 1/2. It was for fun while we ate dinner. soon after that he was doing it all on his own. of course it wouldn't of worked without the blastoff at the end!!!|`|Dq4VswJ6aa	i don't think there really is an age, to be honest,  but he's one smart cookie!  hah, that sounded sorta weird..|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	My son is is turning 3 on Monday and he can't do that. He can write his name. I just depends reall on what thier lerning at the time.|`|dDVAUA9saa	My daughter is 22 months and can count to 13 forwards.  Counting backwards is not high on my priority list right now.
5k0FKWTSaa	How many weeks pregnant are you now? If you are more than 20 weeks pregnant, you should go see your midwife or doctor to have your blood pressure checked - to make sure you're not developing pre-eclampsia. Headaches are one of the symptoms you can get with pre-eclampsia.    Also, do you have a history of migraines before you fell pregnant? And were you on any medication for it? Have you stopped those medications once you fell preg?    The safest medication is probably Paracetamol/Tylenol (as long as you do not take more then the recommended dosage). Sometimes your doctor might prescribe you codeine as well, but beware, if you take codeine for too long, it may actually make the headache worse!    Do not take ibuprofen or voltarol or aspirin without consent from your doctor.     You should see your doctor for a checkup, plus if the migraine' affecting you so often, your doctor can give you a sick note for a few days off work.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	Tylonel is the only thing that you can take....and if that doesn't work, call your doctor and see what they can prescribe you with.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	stay away from food with preservatives, dyes and artificial flavorings and other stuff such as aspartame. No joke, some people complain of horrid headaches yet consume these things which can cause or aggravate them, and worse yet they consume them while pregnant!  Be very careful with labels.. even sulphites are preservatives. This may not completely eradicate the headaches but they can definitely ease or lessen them. And also, stress is a huge factor as well! Try to keep it low, do things that you know to be useful in lowering your stress everyday.  When a part of your body is hurting, it is trying to tell you something. As for the work/time issue, does your work provide a benefit plan that includes long term and short term disability? This may be a time for you to consider using that benefit until you have your migraines under control.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Take tylenol|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Tell your doctor about you migraines if they are frequent.  I had some migraines that lasted 4 or 5 days straight.  I would lay down in a dark, silent room with my feet elevated and a cold pack under my neck and it didn't help.  My doctor prescribed me Tylenol with codeine, but I only take it when necessary.  Frequent migraines can cause blood vessels to rupture, which is dangerous so make sure you tell your doctor about them.|`|fdalc5Rcaa	i have the very same problem and it would go away for a day or two then come back what i did was took paraleif when that didn't work i had to go to my doctor and she gave me a stronger pain killer and since then i have not had to take anything and have been migraine free for a week now tg   hope u feel better best of luck ....
6qtuzvN1aa	I let my 4 year old paint her nails. It's kind of the same thing.|`|DjifToZgaa	He's not doing it already?    He should be doing his homework on a shovel, and walking up hill both ways to preschool.    That Nintendo Wii is making kids soft.|`|TlcMyJeuaa	I think that drtried needs to take his reason and logic over to R&S, where it might be of some use.  It has no place in P&S. In the meantime, the correct answer to your question is clearly 5 1/2.|`|8e8f00fc5b9e9edb3247392086ec523faa	boy or girl?|`|ZYoqZ2Xsaa	I guess four. Maybe you should go inside and make yourself another vodka tonic.|`|V1jg3Onfaa	This is a stoopid question. Stoopid. I have a wife. She may check my answer. So, on that note, I suggest...18.|`|ciPMWGfdaa	Not until they are in middle school I would say 12 or so.  That would be ignorant to give a four year old child a chain saw or axe.|`|uQUqZ7k5aa	if they can walk, then they can chop|`|RyOWcmlvaa	four years old? thats a sick joke. wait till theyre 13. in the meantime, get your lazy *** off yahoo answers and chop it yourself.|`|jERevyR8aa	if ym 4 year old sister doesnt stop back-talking me,  i'm sending her out in the backyard to take care of that tree..  haha jk|`|YmrUXQBcaa	Fer christ's sake, doesn't any body on here work for a living?

I would say as soon as they can hold onto the axe or chainsaw.|`|Dq4VswJ6aa	13.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	The question has no answer if the answer is anything but four, because at that point he would no longer be four years old and the question would be invalid.|`|057SUuSYaa	I bet if you give them enough coffee they'll mow the yard too.

prqrQcd1aa	Thank god I honestly didn't have to deal with days like that when my kids were babies... however there are night when they are like this now, because they are sick..or just don't feel like sleeping. <br>  My boyfriend usually lets me sleep in on days like this when he can and will take care of the kids for me! Before he was around I'd sleep in the room with them and get what ever small amount of sleep I could get!|`|TQW5E6olaa	When she was that age, I'd sleep.<br>  <br>  Hang in there! It gets easier :)|`|01vMpHkWaa	i am actually<br>  JEALOUS!!!|`|lr9E8IC5aa	Awe honey, I feel for you. That stage is so hard. I don't know what is worse that or teething :(<br>  <br>  I know this is a very vague answer, but you just deal with it. Sometimes I would go into another and scream into a pillow, step outside for a moment and take a deep breath or just sit on the floor and cry along with my little guy.<br>  <br>  It's so hard to relax, my youngest is 2 and I still can't do it. Sometimes my mom would come over and just let me sleep, take a shower and read a book.<br>  <br>  Just remember, it doesn't last forever...I promise :)
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	All my kids nursed at least 6-8 times per day until they were a year old.  My oldest and youngest were eating quite a few solids at a year, too.  (My middle child ate almost no solids until after a year and nursed about a million times per day.  ;-)  )<br>  <br>  My youngest is 18 months old, and he still nurses 5-10 times per day in addition to eating three meals and 2-3 snacks.  And he eats plenty of solids, too.  <br>  <br>  Some babies just nurse more than others -- for nutrition, comfort, etc.  It's perfectly normal.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Although my Baby did not Nurse, she took bottles, but she took about 5-6 bottles per day when she had solids. Some babies just like to eat more that others!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	My 11 month old is taking 3 meals plus solids and still nursing up to 10 times a day. I have had to actively start to cut him back though, 6 times on a good day.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	That is how my baby was.  I didn't notice a difference in nursing sessions until maybe 10 months or so.  Now at 13 months she is still nursing about 4x a day.  Morning, before nap, before bed, middle of night.  Sometimes more, sometimes less (today she missed the "before nap" because she fell asleep in the car on the way home from playgroup.  I am sure she will nurse when she gets up though)
m0cmJYDNaa	well my friends tests were all negative too & then she went to the doctor and found out that she was..i would just go to the doctor b/c they can tell very quickly...you probably are not realeasing that "pregnancy hormone"|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Sometimes women may consistently show negative on urine pregnancy tests.  My mother kept coming up negative with me...when she was 6 months pregnant and imagine her suprise when a ultrasound to investigate a possible cyst showed me in there smiling away.  Its possible...check with a doctor :-)  I showed up negative until day 12.|`|Er3imE5Yaa	Well ive been told that some woman can go though a pregnancy not ever getting a positive at all!  That sounds weird but yeah.  Hopefully you get the answer that you want when you go to the doc's.    Baby dust to you and Good Luck!|`|rk2rGy4xaa	sometimes stress can cause your period to be late, but it would help to know your age.

d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I have used Gonal F for 3 cycles and haven't conceived yet.  I don't feel that the cycles were failures as Gonal F did do it job in helping me produce mature follicles and ovulate.  I used Gonal F in April, June and October in 2008.  As you know we are on a little break while trying to prepare for IVF.  That is our next step and our doctor will have me use Gonal F during those cycles as well.  However, I am doing acupuncture for the first cycle ever and am having great results so far with it. I am 6 dpo so I am right there with you in the waiting and wondering part.  I think your cramps may be do to the trigger shot.  I had lots of odd cramping with the Ovidrel.  I guess we both have to wait and see.  Please keep us updated!!!!!!

PKHZNS1Paa	thats how i got pregnant the first time. I wasnt suppose to ovulate until CD16, but ended up having O on CD13 =] it happens|`|K5uoaetaaa	It just it.  You are a human, not a clockwork machine, and these things happen.  That is one of the reasons why conception can be a tricky business.|`|wOyyZjY0aa	I've been there.  For the first 7 months of TTC I was like clock-work.  28 day cycle....ovulated on day 14.....but then all of a sudden my body threw me for a lupe.  I have no idea what is going on.  I now have cycles that go from 23 days to 30 day.  I have no idea when I am going to ovulate. One month I will get a positive OPK on day 10 and then the next month it will be day 16.    It could be from the vitamins, but it's really hard to tell.  Our bodies will do funny things and there is really no way to tell.  I would continue to track it every month.

EAeffKqSaa	Oh sweetie, I know its not fair that careless teenagers can get pregnant and it takes some couples that really want a child, it takes them 6 months to a year to get pregnant.     My best advice for you is to relax and enjoy your time that you have with your man.  Don't make it a chore to get pregnant because you'll lose all that special chemistry you too have together.     It will happen when the time is right for your family to start to bloom.       I'm 28 and my man is 31 and when we were trying for our daughter 2 years ago, I would cry every month for 5 months straight because I was not pregnant then I just quit trying and the next month I got pregnant with her.     Good luck to you and LOTS of baby dust to you.|`|8jQjsNkfaa	maybe your not doing it at the right time lol i sugguest you just do it everyday, that should do it lol|`|IxhQtq5Eaa	Try a sperm count if not get your ovaries checked out.|`|6jKJCuqgaa	i heard some people get pregnant after 10 years, all u have to do is be patient|`|zon13nY2aa	If it makes you feel better it took my parents 2 years before my sister came along.

BABY DUST TO YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|vl0HWTDJaa	It takes about a year on average, just be patient and see a doctor if you haven't conceived by then.|`|LXWZ3Nl6aa	go to a clinic and get tested if you dont get pregnant in like another few months. do it everyday :) goodluck|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	It takes the average healthy couple between the ages of 20-28 yrs old about 6 months to concieve. You are in this age bracket, but your man is a bit older, not old by any means, but statistically that means it could take a bit longer. Relax, you are technically still in the expected time frame for someone your age.    Ovulation kits can be very helpful and you only have to spend about $15 bucks a month on them. The Answer brand is little strips you pee on once a day. You can buy them at Walmart. When the lines start to get darker, your Lh hormone is surging, and that is the hormone released around ovulation. So as the lines get darker, you know you are approaching your fertile phase. Have daily sex for this time frame and there's an excellent chance you'll conceive. It's best to avoid drinking water for 2 hours before you take the test and it's best to take it in the afternoon, around 2pm according to my doc.
n1vKoto7aa	I read a good tip in a magazine once. The mom wrote a simple story (you can make your own) about a rabbit who lived in a garden and ate a bunch of vegetables. You give your kid a plate of vegetables and start reading the story. Every time you read the word "carrot", your child takes a bite of a carrot. Every time you read the words "green bean" your child takes a bite of green bean. To make it more fun so your child is sure to "play along", you can add a stuffed bunny and every time you read the word "hop", your child can make the stuffed bunny hop; every time you read the word "run", the bunny can run, etc. You can customize the story...if you usually buy carrots, peas and corn, but rarely buy, say, celery, only include the things you're likely to have on hand. Or, make more than one story; have a whole collection that you can pull out when needed: a story about some monkeys and some fruit; a rabbit and some vegetables; a shark and some fish sticks (haha).    EDIT: Also, for my older son (he's 5 and 1/2), if we're having something new, I liken it to something I know he likes. For example, if we're having burritos, I tell him it's like a taco. If we're having jambalaya, I tell him it's like spicy spaghetti and meatballs. Or, if I'm serving something I know he doesn't like, I play up the part that he would like. So, if we're having stir fry, I'll talk about the sausage that goes in it, and not the vegetables. If we're having soup, I talk about the noodles, or the homemade bread. It doesn't always work, but most kids are going to picky about some foods.    EDIT: ProudMommy, that's hilarious (especially the cheese cookies)! And, it reminded me of when my son was a toddler....he refused to eat anything with the word onion in it's name, but loved onion bagels, as long as you called them green bagels (they came in a green bag).|`|Gc1bznpTaa	Not really related, but funny story - My 7 year old daughter loves my homemade leek and potato soup, it never looks very appetising but tastes great.  Anyway the other day I asked her what she fancied for supper and she said...''Mummy, I really feel like that lovely soup you make, I can't remember what it is called, but it tastes yummy...I don't know what you put into it but it's the one that looks like sick!''  Had me in stitches...!|`|uLQIXyMMaa	I used to make pictures with the food, and use a little food colouring to make mashed potatoe more interesting, They loved eating a sausage faced clown with broccoli sideburns!|`|G2auAv1Saa	It worked, but it lets your daughter know it is ok to keep secrets from dad- which could be bad down the road.     I tell my 4 year old: Dora or Barbie (whoever she is into) eat the same kinds of food and that usually works for her.|`|AA11984147	LOL!!!  I am having the most fun reading all of these responses.  I wish I had had the problem of my daughter (23 years ago) not wanting to eat!      BUT - I did have to come up with some pretty slick ideas to get her to eat foods that were good for her and she didn't like.      You might also try this - allow your daugther to HELP you make dinner.  Since she is into her Dad bigtime - make it a big deal that both of you are making "Daddy Dinner".     I have taken mashed potatoes and made a mountain and allowed her to fill the mountain's insides with green peas *carrots, corn) (something she would not eat, but did after the mountain we'd make)    She would not eat broccoli - and I'd make them stand up like trees using toothpicks, etc. and she could hold the 'tree'.  It was a joke to her.  But it got her eating good, nutricious foods.|`|6UKd0Gedaa	make mini pizzas in different shapes with lots of veg to make it colourful. it will seem more appealing to her x|`|lNhUgQnuaa	Aww :)  Just do the old if you dont eat this then you cant have desert|`|FP8Avd3oaa	I use the one bit of something they haven't touched then they can get down and play. The other day it was peas or green beans another day. I'm just the "sitter" though so I'm not perfecting my parenting daily!    But I see another point that Mrs H didn't, if you are telling her NOT to tell daddy and then so goes and tells him then she will figure out that telling her not to do something is just a joke.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	I take my cues from the kids.  They are 33 months and 21 months old.  I let them look at the foods first and see what they call them before I tell them what it actually is.  For instance, my son asked me what I had made for dinner one night (he is the oldest) and I said, I don't know, what do you think it is?  He examined it and exclaims, "Potato Cereal!"  Even though he had never obviously had anything by that name, he was excited about it.  It was really shepards pie, and he ate it all!  It was made with burger, potatoes, and veggies.  He ate so much of it and asks for Potato Cereal all the time now, even though if you ask him if he likes burger he gets all disgusted and say's he hates it!    He also only eats ranch dressing on things like chicken, carrots, etc. if we call it sour cream.  He eats broccoli if you call it dinosaurs.  If you ask him if he likes broccoli though, he says he hates it.  He went through a phase this time last year where he would only eat garlic bread if it was called burger!      My daughter has just started this in a way.  It's with peanut butter cookies though.  She will only eat them if you call them cheese! But she hates actual cheese!    I have found that it is all in how you word it and present it!|`|gefna9D7aa	I tell my daughter that peas are really called princess peas and if she eats them all up she will turn into a princess one day lol.x|`|157IYSlqaa	YES! Haha my parents did this one with me....    Pull out food that children are unlikely to eat. A child's reaction is to be curious and ask what that is, or to look at it. Something along the lines of this...  Parent: "This is for grown ups you won't like it"  Child: "I will.."  Parent: "No you wont, Mummy and Daddy like it but YOU wont"    The child will try and prove you wrong, giving you your end result. Try it at least it also worked with my sister, weird bit fo reverse psychology|`|680953cc39f2f929ffb54d3650e54ad7aa	yesterday my son was having meatballs and i asked him how many he wanted and said to him "there is no way you can eat all off them"........he said back to me "i can mum, i bet you i can" so i said "no way in the world" it worked a treat he ate all off them up and all his rice and all the sweetcorn....he would off licked the plate clean if i allowed it LOL !!|`|uDWxcQVaaa	tell her the bad man's gona get her if she dont eat her food the evil food monster that hides under her bed at night or failing that feed her spag bowl kids love it and its nutrisious have you ever made bubble and squeak its mash potato mixed with vegatables and greens and then fried in a frying pan its well nice have baked beans with it and maybe a couple of fish fingers      here is a link 4 making bubble n squeak         http://www.google.co.uk/click?sa=T&ct=re...      edit; lol whats with all the thumbs down the first part of my answer was intended as a light hearted joke i still gave good advice  the bubble and squeak was probebly the best advice given =u can feed her any vegtaballs wihout her knowing personally i think i deserve best answer not thumbs down what a cheek!!!!|`|B2tYVGe6aa	i will gave u something
sRjURY43aa	Do what you feel is best. I agree with you. If you want you can wake her now and feed her. It sounds she didn't eat a lot at 11:15<br>  <br>  do what you want|`|ay8tXLD2aa	I think that at 3 weeks, feeding every three hours is adequate.  Obviously, breastfeeding at this age should still be on demand, meaning if she wants to feed sooner, then yes feed her. But, if she fed at 11:15 I would expect her to wake on her own for a feed around 2pm, but wouldn't wake her up unless it nears 3pm and she hasn't eaten yet.  Even then, at 3pm, I wouldn't wake her out of worry, but more to encourage her to get calories in during the day and keep the day/night straight.|`|el8yX5q3aa	When she wakes up and demands it.  :))) Babies that young eat when they are hungry..they don't have schedules and they don't have the ability to keep to schedules...they need fed.<br>  <br>  NEVER wake a sleeping baby...let her sleep and then feed her.  She will wake up when she is hungry or needs changing.|`|v0596BTeaa	If you wake her she may be sleepy and just feed briefly again.  Give her an hour maybe and see if she wakes up by herself.
CkUjIA1maa	He's dehydrated or had already ejaculated recently.  Or...it's normal for him.  Typical quantity is only a few mililiters - not very much.|`|VS8mactUaa	It means he probably didnt finish :)|`|EMZa78Ydaa	It doesn't really mean anything aside from the fact that not a great deal of it was produced.  Sometimes different types of orgasms will produce various amounts, and sometimes it just means that he's scraping the bottom of the barrel so to speak.|`|1owqylj1aa	When my hubby only comes a little bit it's because we've had sex recently or he's been masturbating a lot. Other than that I'm not sure what else it might be.|`|yLC5WYRMaa	Could be masturbating a bit too much. Also, some medications he might be on may reduce semen (a lot of tv commercials mention that fact).    You could try feeding him more celery! Also, this works too:    http://www.myvolumepillsstory.com/volume...
49We7buoaa	It is possible sperm usually live inside a females vagina for 3-5 days depending on cervical mucus, and if the sperm hit the air it dies instantly, the outer sperm may protect the inner sperm from dying so you might be I'd say chances are slim though.    Good Luck!!|`|OP5XqYt1aa	did the condom have spermicide in it? as it kills it.. alot of condoms nowadays do.. durex do one that doesnt.. its the pleasuremax one (pinkish packet) also the sperm dies quickly so you prob only have a 50/50chance! good luck though x
7LtbetTFaa	I would hope your first concern is what is best for my baby? Without question the answer to that is breastfeeding.|`|AA12370001	so, your logic would be to not give your baby the nutrients and benefits from breast milk just so you have a shot at having bigger breasts.    Mother of the year is defiantly an award you will never win.    Just so you know if you don't breast feed, the milk eventually dries up and your breasts go back to their normal size.|`|AIdFshJwaa	well i didn't breastfeed my baby and my breast size still went down after i had my baby :(|`|EMZa78Ydaa	It would not keep your breast size bigger.  I would say surgery or crazy herbal supplements are your only real hope of that.
QYbMxFE0aa	It will be alright. My brother is in the Navy and him and his girlfriend just had a baby Dec 5th and she moved to be with him. She was born and raised in Missouri and she moved to Georgia and now Cali with him. It is not as hard as you think it is. My fiance just joined the Air Force and Im sure we are going to do our fair share of moving and the thing that I keep in mind is it is not permanent. It is just temporary. Your husband is doing his best to support his family and you have to admire him for that. He needs your support too. You have to be strong for him and your babies and yourself. It will be different but it is and experience you get to have the rest of your life. You can go back to Cali someday but for now suck it up and be a strong wife, mommy!! It could be amazing if you will just let it.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if u feel like u are really depressed, u should see a doc  if u r just stressing over the move, try not to, bad for you and baby; while easier said than done...u will make new friends, i am sure there will be plenty of mothers there and u could join playgroups and such to meet ppl, go to playgrounds, etc...tough, but u can do it!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I think you will find so many other Army wives in the same boat when you get there. You will all have this in common and will become great friends. They too will have small children so your kids will have instant friends. The people of New Orleans are very friendly you will find. I think this will turn into a wonderful experience for you and your family.|`|AejHsnupaa	keep the baby and see your doctor,he/she may help as pregnancy can make u feel that way,or look on the brighter side of it,new friends and maybe more room for new baby when born.|`|dR5GO9Dkaa	Make an appointment with your OB.  Talk to your doctor, this could be a form of PPD.  You have some time before you leave to find out what military wive's groups are on the base you're relocating to.  Until then, take care of yourself, your baby, and remember that change isn't always bad- it's an adventure for you and your little family, and by going you'll be supporting your husband and having a new experience together.  Good luck!
P0Fjh59Eaa	I don't like:  Hailey Madison Harlow- two trendy names. Madison means SON of Maud. to me that's masculine. and Harlow- though cute is a bit trendy.    Hailey Graceie Rose- the spelling of Graceie is horrid (Gracie is fine). Grace and Rose are filler these days.    Hailey Olivia Madison- same as above for Madison, i do like Olivia, but it's very common.    Hailey Jessica May- Jessica screams 80s, May is boring filler.    i like:  Hailey Nicole Elizabeth- though both middles are common they sound lovely together. i do think the flow would be a bit better as Hailey Elizabeth Nicole.    Hailey Francis Pearl- it's honoring a family member, always a fav thing to do in my book! and they are not common names, it's fresh and lovely! my fav.|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Hailey Rebecca Rose|`|HEhRgr7Zaa	I am big on family names so I think you should include Pearl in one. Frances is just dated....Hailey Elizabeth Pearl is pretty I like Hailey Olivia also.|`|FrkF7PaRaa	Hailey Madison Harlow and Hailey Francis Pearl are really cute names. Pearl is an awesome name to keep in the family, I would totally rock it!|`|pofQofLqaa	I like Hailey Madison Harlow. Just think about when you are going to have to middle name your child do you want to have to spit out "Hailey Madison Harlow!" Maybe something a little simpler like Hailey Jo Madison or Harlow, Hailey Jane Elizabeth, Hailey Rose Pearl, Hailey May Madison,     I don't like Gracie with it, Hailey Gracie....just doesn't go.|`|ucSTZRqraa	They are all beautiful names, Hun.  I might switch them a bit and go with Hailey Frances Rose.|`|vSXyODyraa	I love Elizabeth|`|6fc0IPcTaa	I like the third one - Hailey Graceie Rose the best. Graceie has a cool spelling to it, and overall, the name combination is the best.     Good luck! :-)|`|NWEJdpocaa	I love Hailey Francis Pearl...that's really adorable!!|`|HurPmgSaaa	I love Hailey Olivia Madison and Hailey Francis Pearl.I also love that Pearl is your Grandma's name, that makes me favor that name more.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	Make it a family tradition.    I like Hailey Grace Rose.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Hailey Elizabeth Rose  Hailey Grace Nicole|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I like Hailey Nicole Elizabeth  Hailey Madison Harlow    how about  Hailey Savannah Paige  Hailey Lillian Grace  Hailey Christine Anne  Hailey Gabrielle Reese|`|utfoP7GWaa	I like Hailey Madison Harlow, but if it were me I would just use Madison Harlow (I'm not a fan of the name Hailey; I think it's been over used in the past few years!)|`|AA10325228	I like Hailey Olivia Madison the best!|`|eJwAZEyZaa	Hailey Jessica May i love that name =]|`|gEkLQWF4aa	I think Hailey Olivia Madison is the best out of those names. Nicole Elizabeth is too common, Harlow sounds too much like Harlet, and Gracie Rose is an old name, so is Francis Pearl, but if you want to honor your grandmother that would be good, just think about your daughter having to live with that name. Jessica May is too old sounding, as well.|`|YLgdMXiQaa	I like the 2nd one and the 5th one|`|BPckjS68aa	Honestly Id have to say either Hailey Nicole Elizabeth or Hailey Madison Harlow. They seem to have a better flow when saying them.|`|RnCmQtUbaa	the first one is so pretty, and definately my favorite.    i think the rest almost sound like a list of names rather than someone's entire name, you know?|`|8rt7OR35aa	I kinda like Hailey Olivia Madison.  I dunno why.  I just think it flows.|`|ORTgVekcaa	i think Hailey Jessica May goes really nice XD|`|2bTk5Eixaa	I like the 2nd one.|`|QzBgeyKeaa	I like Hailey Jessica Pearl :) ...|`|X2cApvrcaa	Hailey Nicole Elizabeth  Hailey Jessica May|`|1ajBTe8raa	Hailey Imogen Rose???    Like your 3rd choice x good luck|`|egdTgJ75aa	Try   Hailey Francis Rose  Or  Hailey Madison Harlow|`|eda699c69fc8eaff0f10239e82b318d9aa	Personally, I don't like 2 middle names. I'm not meaning to offend.    Hailey Nicole Elizabeth- Pretty   Hailey Madison Harlow-  I don't like this one  Hailey Graceie Rose- Hailey Rose is ok, but I don't like Graceie   Hailey Francis Pearl   Hailey Olivia Madison- This is my favorite  Hailey Jessica May- It's alright|`|8R4HfTveaa	I think the best names there are:  hailey  nicole  Elizabeth slightly over used i think you maybe want a more unique name  pearl  madison - is diffrent  (in a good way)  jessica  may  the best set it probably the bottom one but id really would go for what you like the best also it depends on what your daughter looks like depending on what suits her best|`|hIq0Wn56aa	Ya I say do if you want to! Its a tradition, so why not keep it going.    I LOVE Hailey Madison Harlow, flows so pretty and those are all beautiful names. :)|`|vvAyfBGCaa	I like Hailey Jessica May and Hailey Olivia Madison. Those are the cutest and they flow the most.|`|YspJulqKaa	I would take your grandma's name because it adds somthing to the name. I am named after my great aunt that i never met and i feel closer to her in a way.
K5TrkUhCaa	I have weird dreams all the time lol. I have actually woke up crying or talking or yelling because that's what I was doing in my dream. In one of my dreams (I was pregnant with my first at the time) I had gained so much weight and I looked so fat and nobody would believe me when I told them I was pregnant and then when I went into labor I was in the L&D ward and they were telling me to push and I kept pushing and out popped a giant ball of fat. Then the doctor told me I was never pregnant and that I was just fat. Lol, one of my biggest worries through out my whole first pregnancy was that it wasn't really happening and that I would go in to have a baby and be told that I wasn't really pregnant.    **Danielle that's so crazy! I've had those great sex dreams too lol. It's weird because you can't control it because you are asleep when it happens, but then you wake up like right afterwards and your like 'Oh my gosh did I just orgasm in my sleep?!'. It happened a couple times when my husband was right next to me in bed too and I was sooo embarassed lol.|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	Isn't it amazing how all our hopes and fears come through at this time?  I was first pregnant in 1981.  I had the same dreams each night.  I was in Beirut and the israelis were bombing the city.  I am not Lebanese, nor did I have a connection with that part of the world outside these dreams.  I have a friend who had travelled the world and she had said that Beirut is the most beautiful city in the world.  So, every night, I lived in a house on the bay, some nights my mom was with me, sometimes with my sister across the bay (in my dreams). Every night one or the other of us and our houses would be destroyed. That went on for months and months.  During this time, I had an obnoxious cat who would jump on my belly and wake me up in absolute terror!    I hope that you find some humor and creative solutions from your dreams.  I wish you an easy birth and I know your baby will be perfect!      My birthday is July 9th, an auspicious day!  July babies rock!  Both my nieces and my nephew are July kids, too.|`|OwK17Qo1aa	Mine last night (I'm 18 weeks) was I was laying in bed and all of a sudden I looked down at my stomach and I was further along than I am now and I could see the baby's knee and foot standing out. Then all of a sudden it was like my baby was having a seizure and it lasted what seemed like forever in my dream. I just remember my heart was racing and I started to feel like something was terribly wrong with my baby and I didn't know what to do. I don't know if its because my baby the past week has been super busy and I feel like I have a jumping jelly bean in my stomach.|`|8TmEYxF3aa	When I was pregnant with my son, and my husband was in New York training for an upcoming deployment, I had the greatest sex dream. And yes, even finished. It was the weirdest thing I have ever experienced!     I had heard about them when I was pregnant with my daughter but never had any with her. I just had very vivid dreams with her.|`|dd5d0f065b45c14a02d51f88fefe773eaa	Mine was I was in an old hospital and I was waiting to be admitted to L&D, well all of a sudden the baby "fell" out and a nurse took him and I didn't see him for days. When they brought him back he was a teenager!! I was about 15 weeks when I had the dream! I am now almost 24 weeks and I have dreams that I am in violent movies or a character in video games!! (I don't even play video games).|`|oXCo6VX4aa	So far the food related dreams have been the weirdest.  I'll be at a candy store, or the chocolate room from Willy Wonka's factory or at a lunch counter and be soooo hungry but not able to eat anything because of all the crazy things that are going on.  For example, at the lunch counter all of the fish dishes were actually really huge fish that were floating in the air, still alive and splashing water all over the customers. And some of the food was fake when I tried to spoon it up.  And then, at some point, my food lost all gravity and I couldn't keep it on my tray.  (I'm not taking any kind of drugs, I promise  :)  ).     Sometimes in my dream the baby will already be there and I'm worried about getting food for the baby as well.  I always wake up really hungry in the morning and I think that's why I'm having such strange dreams about food... :)|`|6qNYzZC2aa	the strangest one was i went into hospital to give birth and as i was in labor i pushed and my partner was standing there with goal keeper gloves on and ready to catch when he caught the baby i looked at her face and she was my granny very strange stuff|`|cyBcZ1dVaa	I had a really weird dream that I pulled my placenta out of my vagina.  Kinda freaked me out!  I guess weird dreams are normal for us pregnant women.
vigFmfLmaa	It can take up to that long even for normal healthy couples.  After a year you can pursue fertility screenings to see if there are any problems.  You could be one of the lucky who get it right the first try though.  You never know...|`|AA11616741	10 months and had a tubal pregnancy in my left tube, 5 months later another tubal pregnancy this time in the right tube, and have been on the lupron shot for the 6 months following the second tubal pregnancy.

1owqylj1aa	you should definitely get him to stop. It can reshape the roof of his mouth causing problems for him later in life. My daughter had a problem sucking her two middle fingers up until she was two and her dentist said it's imperative to get her to stop asap to prevent any complications.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Yes, get him to stop. Stay on him, I mean don't cause him psychological damage (felt like I had to say that) but be firm and maybe start light punishment after a few days of No's...|`|21eb1fee7277ed0dfc6c417c0a528dddaa	If you have the money get one of those thumb guards. I have also bought that nail polish for biting. It helps but isn't perfect.  He needs to stop that now. My son's dentist said he needed to stop sucking his thumb completely before he turned four, or he would need braces. He is 5 now, and its still happening. He knows he isn't supposed to do it, but will hide to get in his thumbsucking. He has an overbite, and I know I am going to hear the word "braces" when he gets holder.|`|q8nkzBspaa	If he is trying to stop then just give him gentle reminders. He should stop because it can damage his teeth and I have seen some nasty thumbs that are all cracked open and raw from sucking on them. A sticker chart could help. Everytime you catch him not sucking he gets a sticker. 5 stickers = a treat. This method may help him remember to stop and it is reinforcing the wanted behavior (not sucking). Just be patient he will stop eventually.|`|1dnAUzIgaa	I sucked my thumb until I was 16 y/o.My teeth were pushed forward.I wish my parents stopped me.I promise you,you are not being too hard on him!!Make him stop!|`|xmzvUFR3aa	I had the same concerns with my 2 year old who sucks his thumb constantly.Sucking his thumb is a way for him to comfort himself. Give him something else that he can use as a way to comfort himself. He's only 3 so you shouldn't bug him about it to much, he'll get out of the habit eventually. You don't have to be concerned about him damaging his teeth until his permanent teeth begin to come out.
cYRZpGkqaa	wonderful! that's so exciting! i can't wait until my daughter reaches that age!|`|WJjfrf0Caa	That's awesome.

My son is in 1st grade and I remember when he first started to write. If I were you, I would add a question to your post though or it might get deleted if its not technically a question. Add something like "Is this good for a 3 year old" or something like that. I had something deleted once because it wasn't a question..blah blah. Very cute though. You should keep teaching him how to write all the letters of the alphabet. He will really be on his way then!|`|b6f151d22968bb6b096edc46ea223f85aa	That's great! our daughter wrote her name when she was 3 1/2. keep practicing and he will start writing it more and even mommy and daddy!|`|AA10368587	GOOD JOB|`|Dq4VswJ6aa	aww(:  That's not too bad, actually!

My niece started walking 2days before she turned 10 months and I was super excited about that.|`|F5UxjLaqaa	Wonderful!!!|`|kUuxoZjQaa	My 2 year old just put her pants on by herself, granted they were backwards (tag in front) but she did it all on her own. I know how you fee. I was so thrilled. It's amazing when they hit those big kid type of things.
miPubuDYaa	I can't see why not. My cousin was in the pool and the sun while pregnant with all 4 of her children.. I concieved in August and spend a few days in the sun before i knew i was pregnant. So far so good.    Ask your doctor but i cant see anything that would hurt the baby. Just stay hydrated. Thats my only concern with being in the sun.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Its fine to get sun, its healthy and good for you to get outdoors during pregnancy.  I would reccomend a tanning salon or whatever, but I would say you can do normal outdoor activites tan your arms and legs and stuff,  I always felt wierd abotu having too much sun on my belly cuz I alwasy think it would irritate the baby being all exposed to the sun (they can see light during the third trimester)  But just go for it, who wants to be all pasty anyway?|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Of course it's fine, why wouldn't it be? I don't know why you think it would be dangerous or bad for you or your baby.|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Yes you should be fine just be careful you don't get burned and end up with sun stroke. Not good for a pregnant woman.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	As long as you dont let you body over heat then I say its ok. I am due at the end of May & plan on being out in the sun & water if its a pretty day. But just to be extra safe ask your DR because he might have his own reasons he doest want you being out in the sun for too long.|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	that should be just fine|`|8dc41485498f18170d31c362140f42aaaa	cant see it being a problem!|`|evlzeZohaa	What is your fear? Are you afraid the baby will drown if you get into the water? The water can't possibly go into the womb where the baby is at. Don't have a fear of that. Get into the water as much as you like and enjoy your summer. Just stop when your in your 8th and 9th month's or when you feel uncomfortable about it.|`|23601a2348cb3f972406062ffa7f9839aa	I was pregnant this past summer and delivered in July 10th. 11 days before I had him I was at the water park with my oldest in the kiddy pool area and got a slight sunburn. It didn't hurt the baby at all. The water actually helped me to feel better and took some of the added weight off my joints and muscles. I found it  very relaxing and didn't want to leave. Just stay away from hot tubs and don't get overheated. It's said that an elevated body temp can cause harm to the baby. And make sure you drink plenty of water, but you should be doing that anyway. Have fun and enjoy.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i dont see why it wouldnt be ok..just dont over heat which is very easy when your prego in the summer and stay hydrated...being in the water will help with any swelling also.....
BZ5z5pXqaa	yes..all 3 have..but it didnt bother me because they were just repeating what other people called me..no big deal|`|1G3XPiq3aa	My daughter did a couple of times when realized that was actually my name, just to try it out I think.<br>  <br>  I called my mum by her first name when I was a baby. It was my first word. It wasn't disrespect or anything, it's just my dad always called her that in front of me instead of calling her "mummy" around me like a lot of parents do I think|`|nmu6coapaa	Well what else is your nephew going to call you? By someone elses name?|`|1s3nddaYaa	maybe they want aunt or uncle in front of it.|`|ay8tXLD2aa	I don't know many toddlers who HAVEN'T gone through this phase! I think it's natural as they are learning that you have a name, and it's not "mommy" or "daddy" (side note: what is it you want your nephew to call you?)<br>  <br>  My niece used to call my sister by her first name, (Liz) and when my sister would correct her she would call her Mommy-Liz....she outgrew it. My sister just always reminded her that yes, my name is Liz, but you should call me Mommy. As with everything else with kids, it's a phase, and the novelty wears off eventually!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	no, my daughter knows my name but never addresses me by it. However she does address her father by it sometimes which makes me laugh, probably because she hears me call him by his name instead of "daddy" because we are separated. I do address him ad your daddy when speaking directly to her though.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	My almost 9 month old son just called me by my first name for the first time about a week ago, lol it was cute and unexpected.  He usually calls me Mama or Mommy though, but every once in awhile he'll call me Jess.  I think most kids go through this at one point or another, lol, :D.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	That's really funny-Yesterday I took my son to his 3 year check-up, and he called me by first name while in the DR's office. It was kind of embarrassing but really cute. He loves to randomly call my husband and I by our first names, lol.|`|heDtLdz5aa	well my son is only going to be 16 months on saturday...so only time will tell me that one...but i know both of my nieces called my sister and their dad by their firsts names a few times...it was cute..but broke my sister and her husband's heart...he he|`|1SGl03Zlaa	My daughter learned how to say my name before she learned how to say mom.  I babysat my nieces so she heard them calling me by name all the time.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	Sometimes I'm worried that my baby will, because my husband calls me by my first name, and so does my stepson.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Nope....And they better never...LOL :)|`|sRjURY43aa	No. but my almost 2 year old in April asked me what my name was though... it was pretty funny/ cute. She doesn't call me by that though|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Well my mom said I went through a stage when I was just learning to really talk and I would call her by her first name sometimes.  It wasn't a big deal she said.  I think it is just a phase children go through and honestly if they hear everyone else call you that then they will pick it up until they know that you are mom to them and "Jane" to the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  Also why would it matter if your nephew called you by your name? Most very young children don't add aunt or uncle in front of the name because it is too long and they are just learning.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	My son is 3 and usually calls me "mommy" but if I don't pay attention to him or if I'm busy doing something and not paying attention he'll say my first and middle name very sternly (totally in my dad's voice too...I'm 25 and it cracks me up because my dad still uses the first and middle name intimidation when I do something to piss him off)
mx3gFmIKaa	No its not a very high chance of twins.  You are a part of the 8-10 percent.  For a typical cycle conceiving is only 20 percent.  I had 3 mature follicles and did end up conceiving 1 baby using ovidrel trigger after clomid, and IUI.  Have sex today to give it a chance to have a girl baby.  Friday with the IUI likely a boy.      Male sperm swim quicker but die faster.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Im not sure. When i was on Clomid I never had u/s to see how many follicles there were but yes there is a chance you could have multiples! neways TONS OF BABY DUST YOUR WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Wok0Y6ebaa	There are usually more than 2 follicles, but that doesn't mean automatically that you are going to have multiples.  That would mean that both eggs would have to be fertilized, implant, and be healthy enough to grow.  Clomid makes you produce more follicles than without it.
cn2rvsdOaa	I love:    Matthew Elijah and Hannah Kathleen.    How about:    Laura Grace and Jacob Thomas!|`|ZZHvaCSBaa	well in my opinion i think you should chose one of those names but have their middle names as your parents name.

1SGl03Zlaa	I would say 3 months, most baby swimming lessons start at that age.|`|GjtIXiK9aa	Once your baby has had the first set of innoculations, they are covered.|`|5LVryyiEaa	I think the main reason you're supposed to wait is because of their immune system. If they haven't had any vaccinations they're more prone to the bacteria in pools and other bodies of water. I guess it's really up to you and how comfortable she is with the water, just make sure the water warm because they still can't regulate their body heat very well. The earliest you can typically take mommy and me swimming classes are 6 months though.|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	Pediatricians say not to take them swimming till they are around 8 months and that is still pretty young to them. The recommended age is 2 years. <br>  Living in a hot place though that is not possible for me. I took my son when he was 5 months to both the pool and the beach. You'll be fine just make sure she doesn't swallow too much water though.|`|h85kkDsbaa	I was advised to wait until my son had all his jabs so at 16 weeks, I think you can go after first set of jabs tho.|`|VXhOLgDEaa	I took my daughter at like 2-3 mths...lol. She had fun and she was sooo cute in her bathing suit. She's 10 mths now..and I can't wait until we go to the pool this summer!!!!|`|xvNIw9xyaa	6 months is the recommended time to wait until...I wouldn't wait until then though. Wait until your little girl can hold her head up okay. If she can, then you can take her, but still be careful because they do get tired and flop around their heads a bit. Don't use a baby float until your baby can sit upright on their own fairly well. Hope in 6 weeks or so you can have fun swimming. They have some ADORABLE little outfits...<br>  OH another thing. They don't make swim diapers that small. If you are going to a public pool, regular diapers aren't allowed in the water. However if you are just at your house or a nearby swimming hole, use a regular diaper to prevent poop in the water. be warned though, that the diaper will swell with water and get huge.
9Xt3UpB1aa	I know someone who had 8 false negatives and she was actually pregnant. You can call your local hospital and have a walk-in blood pregnancy test done to test your HGC hormones to see if you really are.<br>  My hospital charges $15 for one, it you find out your results in 3-4 hours.|`|079d2408b404792068cec1c2e4eb8488aa	You should go to the dr. and have a test done if you can't get a good reading on home pregnancy test.|`|96HWpdkFaa	If they aren't coming up with an answer then they are broken. And you need to buy a new one. I've had that happen before too.<br>  <br>  If I were you I'd go to the doctor and get a blood test. It will tell you for sure.|`|2LUa46c6aa	i kinda went through that wen i was prego wit my son. i didnt get mines 4  a month wen i took the test it sed NEG. but i still never got it, so i used another kind and then i got a pink +. anyway u can try a different kind or go 2 the doc's. although i was told that some ppl cycel changes with the weather. maybe its that.
rAkWoweOaa	If you are talking about groceries...  I go once a week and spend:  $50 on fresh meats, which I have a deep freeze.  $15 on milk  $50 on snacks and frozen "junk food" like pizzas and hot pockets. When I say frozen I mean frozen veggies as well.  $40 on snacks and chips and bread  $20 on fresh fruit  $20 on cheese and other dairy  $15 on juice and sodas.  We have about 4 we feed.
rMNWd17saa	I have 6 children, five were born at 38 weeks one at 39 weeks.  With 4 of them (the ones I delivered vaginally) It literally felt like their head was between my legs.  I felt like I could hardly walk the last week because I could feel them soooo low.  The longest labor I had was 4hrs44mins the quickest was 1hr1min.  I went from 2cm to 10cm  in 1/2 hr.    Every woman is different, every baby is different, every pregnancy is different and every labor is different.    To get things moving along drink lots of water!  Walk-Walk-Walk!  Do some squats, have sex.  Have lots of sex!  Orgasms cause your uterus to contract.  Nipple stimulation can also cause contractions.  Some say that spicy foods help too.    Good luck and God Bless!!!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Your doctor is taking your pain seriously.  Your doctor is right about you feeling that because baby is so low.  When baby gets so low into the pelvis, it is literally spreading and widening, your whole lower region hurts, your back, hips, pubic bone, vagina may even get sore because of all the pressure, it's all normal.  I am also 37 weeks and for the past week and a half I have felt like I have been doing to splits for a month or feel as if I had been riding a bike all day thats how sore my pubic bone is from the babies head and all the pressure.  Where his head is doesn't mean anything about when labor starts or how long it will take.  Babies heads sometimes engage weeks before delivery and sometimes don't engage until right before delivery.  Everything your going through is normal.  You can go walking, do squats, or have sex to help move things along, but if that baby isn't ready that baby isn't coming.    As for the dilation and effacement, well it's pretty pointless to be checked until in active labor.  It either gives you false hope (women can sit at 4cm for weeks and still go over due) or it can disappoint (women are told they are not dilated but then go into labor the next day).  ALl doctors say "you wont make it to 40 weeks" to just about every pregnant woman.  It just encourages the women that the end IS near and that they wont be pregnant forever.  You really have just about as much as a chance of going into labor any minute as any other full term pregnant woman (dilated or not).  Goodluck|`|CRVi3YsOaa	It very well could be, I delivered my 2nd and 3rd daughter at 37 weeks. On my second one, I went in to be enduced but by the time i got there I was already contracting, effaced and dialated to a 5, so they just made it go a little faster. But it could be less then 3 weeks, but since you are not dialated it could be longer, but I wouldn't count on it|`|AA12240329	ugh i'm 37 weeks too cant wait no more.|`|jBhP00LXaa	I had a similar problem, my baby was 4/5ths engaged for what seemed like forever. As a result whenever i moved i had an excruciating pain right down in the lower abdomen. The midwife told me that this was just due to the baby being engaged. However i think that even though your baby is so far down, it doesnt really hold any sway over when your labour will begin. I went 10days over despite him being engaged and ready to go. I ended up having a c-section.   As for the contractions you have been having, is there a possibility that they are just braxton hicks?  My advice is just sit back and play the waiting game.   However i am not in the medical profession and if you still need answers then i recommend sitting down and having a one to one with your midwife, they will answer any question you have, no matter how silly or trivial you think it is. Its always better to keep asking. Hope everything goes well for you
AC8iXL5Saa	Your employers have a legal obligation to do a risk assesment for you if you're pregnant. And overheating wont harm the baby but can make ypou dizzy and faint and thats not good! Go to your docs and ask their advice, they can write a letter for your employer if they feel your health is at risk, dont let them fob you off!|`|YzKA4XF2aa	I'm not sure on the legality of heating/cooling conditions but have you considered picking up a small fan or two and putting them around your desk?  You can probably find a couple of inexpensive fans.  If you feel you shouldn't have to pay, ask your supervisor if you can purchase them and be reimbursed.  If they stay at they office, maybe they will consider doing so.  It never hurts to ask.  Good luck cooling down.
mZjdxuweaa	I used castor oil.. and I know that people tell you not to.. But I took one teaspoon with OJ and I went into labor that night and had my son 11 hours later!! I was 37weeks and 2 days. My son weighed 7 pounds 5 oz 3 weeks early|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	You have a little longer to go before I would start trying to induce. Those babies come when they are ready and they shouldnt be forced otherwise unless medically necessary. You are almost there you should try to hang in there until your little one is ready. Good luck and congratulations.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	I agree with Jessie.  I'm due the 14th of Feb, I am 37 weeks now, your 12 days behind me so technically your 35 going into 36 weeks and not considered term yet.  (term is normally 38-42 weeks although some doctors for some reason think 37 weeks is)  If your swelling is THAT bad, I would call the doctor and tell them.  They may want to check it out since severe swelling of the hands and face can be a symptom of pregnancy induced hypertension or preeclampsia.\      Edit:  February 18th, your barely reaching 37 weeks.  Not term.  Why do you want to force your baby out?  Because your a little uncomfortable?  We ALL are uncomfortable, sore, swollen, tired, and ready for it to be over with, but that is no reason to want to force yourself to go into labor if your body and baby are not ready.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	I tried everything from sex and walking to castor oil and pineapple juice... nothing would ever work.  I did ask my midwife to do a membrane stripping and that started after about 3 days but the procedure is really uncomfortable and doesn't always work.  She wouldn't do that until I was 39 weeks though.  Good luck!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	i walked when i was having contractions.|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	castor oil worked for me too.|`|65195589e245f2da9d89cac376b35462aa	Don't drink castor oil!! Why can't you trust God and just let the baby be born when he or she is supposed to. You're only 37 weeks you technically have 3 more weeks. Easy does it!! Your baby will get here one way or another, RELAX!!    P.S. Yes walking helps, but only if you are ready to go into labor.|`|ddiBVrt1aa	Everyone will put a thumbs down.. haha    i never had contractions ever and i was at 38 weeks! I drank castor oil the whole bottle lol 8 ounces.... and then went to bed and then i woke up at about 9am and had the baby lol    good luck|`|4D1VEKW5aa	I would advise to let it happen when its supposed to. My sisters doc misdiagnosed her due date and she induced at 38 weeks and the baby came out actually 1 mnth early with breathing problems. I think a couple more weeks of discomfort is worth avoiding that.|`|oyvOSYx9aa	I tried everything- long walks, sex, spicy foods, bouncing on a gym ball loads of things but nothing worked.  I was induced at 41wks+3days and ended up having an emergency c-section at 41wks+6days.  My sisters whole body swelled up when she got towards the end of her pregnancy, she had pre-eclampsia and was induced at 38wks- she also ended up with a emergency c-section.  Try to relax if you are swollen. Everyone is different though so some of these tricks may work for you, remember babies hardly ever arrive on their due date, most of them come late.  Good luck.|`|a4e78542edad454de0d2f46b82d2a1e1aa	You should be about 35 weeks almost 36 weeks if your due Feb. 26th. My due date is Feb. 25th and I am 36 weeks today. I went into the hospital last night and was having contractions. They stopped them and let me come home today. They said having the baby this early could lead to her having breathing problems at birth. I know how uncomfortable you must be with all the swelling...but hang in there you will meet your new baby girl very soon!!! I don't really think that there is anything you can do to speed up the process. Sorry =[
CZWppOKvaa	Was there a question in there, or was it just a rant?     Going by your title, I gather the question was, as a man, do you have a say on the abortion issue?  Well, if your partner is comptiplating an abortion, then yes, I would say that your should have some input.      As to the overall debate of wether abortion should be legal or not, everyone is entitled to an opinion.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I will say this the man has every right to *help* make a decision on wither you should become a father or not.     Thumbs down I couldn't care less but you all know it is the truth|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You have every right to express your opinion. People just may not always agree with them. Just because you have never been pregnant does not mean that you don't have a right to express your thoughts and wants with the child. Because that is your child as well.|`|YKeF3FyBaa	everyone has a right to voice their opinion|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Honestly, on a large scale, you probably wouldn't be taken seriously in regards to abortion because it doesn't directly affect your body. You would just have to point out what you know about abortion and your beliefs in regards to that.   However, if you and your wife, girlfriend, partner, what have you, were expecting, then your opinion does matter. It would be your baby too, therefore she should respect what you have to say.    Abortion is such a sensitive topic.    Honestly, I would take your opinions seriously. You have as much of an opinion on it as any woman, and you're obviously more learned than some women.|`|BxrU8kUJaa	Should you have a voice? Sure, scream to the heavens.  Do you have a vote?  Nope.  The way the law stands now the person taking the physical beating from the pregnancy and/or terminating it has the sole decision.      That's not any sort of rationalization or overly emotional answer, it's just the simple truth.|`|v0BvbOOSaa	As Jennifer puts it, everyone has a right to voice their opinion so you have a voice too.  That said, as a man if it is you (not the woman) who decides whether or not a woman should get an abortion, it implies that you have ownership over her body.  Let's say that the woman in your life has got pregnant and decides to have an abortion. You can voice your opinion, of course. You can discuss it with her rationally how you can work things out so you both can have the child. If it comes to it, you can even beg, plead, cry. But ultimately, if she decides that there is no way out but to get an abortion, it is a decision that you have to respect.|`|joPJtKemaa	GET A LIFE!!!!!!!!    AND QUIT BEING SO PHILOSOPHICAL!!!!|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	I am pro life so yes I think you should have a say if it is your baby. I think the father, if he is around should have a say. It doesnt matter to me if its her body, its his kid too and he has a rightto say he wants to raise it if she doesnt|`|fa0BCSzUaa	So you are saying that everyone who is pro-choice is a poor white trash nobody?    Wrong.    I think that 1. YOU are not responsible, or in charge of someone else's body or their decisions. 2. YOU do not know what it's like to be in someone else's shoes until you are literally living what they are living.    Why must you pro-lifers feel the need to rant and voice your opinions on abortion? Why is it any of your business what someone else does with their life? Are you going to adopt this baby? Are you going to pay for it if the mother decides to give birth? No, didn't think so. You're not going to be the one to follow through and practice what you preach.|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	Of course you have a voice! As long as you are against it.|`|jtnS02Vxaa	To be completely honest I think there should be a double standard if the woman wants to have an abortion but the man wants to raise the child or give the child up for adoption then he should be allowed to fight the decision but if the woman wants to keep the baby and the man wants her to have an abortion than she should have the right to chose life....I'm very prolife so that has a lot to do with my decision but my cousin is still heartbroken over his ex girlfriend killing their unborn 18 week old baby and he would have been a wonderful father and she would have gotten off scotch free no strings attached but instead she was very selfish|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Everybody has a right to a 'voice' in the matter, whether or not that voice is listened to is another story. These women are stubborn and just dont wanna listen to anyone except the people who agree with them.|`|wWGNvMIQaa	If it is against abortion.....yes!  If it is for abortion.......no!  Hahaha  Well I guess you can see where I stand. I feel it takes two to tango, and if you are in that situation, then you should have a say. If both partners do not agree 100% one way or the other, then life should be the answer and adoption should be considered, whoever does not take care of the baby has to pay child support wether it be the mom or the dad. Both are parents, not just the mom. Both had sex, not just the mom. My husbands mother conceived him when she was fifteen. Her and her parents wanted her to have an abortion, but my father in law told her that he felt it was wrong, and if she did not want the baby, give birth and she would not have to worry about him ever again. So yes you should have a say, but there really shouldn't be any question when it comes to murdering an innocent life. From the moment of conception, it is a LIFE!!!! It has a heartbeat at 6 weeks that can be heard. how can you kill something that is so helpless and relying solely on the outside world for it's well being?|`|dd5d0f065b45c14a02d51f88fefe773eaa	You took part in the sex, you took part in the pregnancy and you will take part in the child's life so YES you have a say so!!! A woman cannot get pregnant on her own and shouldn't terminate a pregnancy on her own either!!|`|zRLm2YxIaa	In reality the man should probably have a say in whether the baby is aborted since it's half his DNA too, however since the woman is the one who carries the child and is usually the primary care giver she gets the ultimate say.  I would say if the two of you could reach a decision together that would be ideal.|`|aa1o6Rs0aa	I agree with you. Mother Theresa had a lot to say on that very issue. When Roe V. Wade was passed she said something to the effect of the abortion issue will pit men against women, women against their own children and bodies and will attempt to remove men from the process of pregnancy. I'm sorry to say to all those ladies out there, but you would never be pregnant without the man. I think men should have a say in whether their partners abort. Absolutely.
sRy2SKpXaa	When you don't want to know, you tell the technician when you're going in that you do not want to know the sex of the baby, and they won't tell you, or point out those parts, lol. I'm 31w 2d and when I found out the sex of this baby I had her write down on a piece of paper what the sex was, so that after my appointment I could call my husband and we'd find out at the same time. I was looking at the screen the whole time and didn't see anything to indicate the gender (however my mother said she saw his little thing) But maybe that's just me, i'm sure other people could tell if they look hard enough.|`|VUKDrd2taa	Im not really sure if they dont go to that "region"  if you arent wanting to know,lol but i know that i saw i was having a little boy plain and clear before she even told me, it was in plain sight lol.|`|hIzQyflqaa	its too hard to tell what your baby is from ultrasound unless you know what you are looking for, they will stay away from babies area if you tell them you dont want to know!|`|t1ecTYWRaa	you should tell your doctor before you go that you dont want to know the sex of the baby.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	They ask you if you want to know... Those sonograms are so eleborate you have to be PRETTY knowledgable to be able to read one of those untrained and tell the sex of the baby... if you don't want to know, you don't have to look at the screen. Just get the printouts of the shots the sonographer gives you that aren't of the babies "down there" parts... or for us grownups, the penis or vagina...|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Alot of times it's difficult for the untrained eye to determine the sex through an ultrasound picture.  Of course, the best thing to do is to tell the doctor or US tech that you don't want to know and they should stay away from that private area!

It is possible if it was just spotting it was implantation. I would wait a few more days and then test. If the horrible pains are unbearable I would call your doctor.

My fourteen year old will work on a fry stand for a carnival this year , he did it last year for a month and made really good money. But I know the people very well and are friends with the family so they have the rules. (most parents wouldn't let someone do this if they didn't really know the person though).    You could also use your talents that you have, like maybe if you are good in school maybe you could tutor a child for a few bucks a week, or teach a child how to draw. if you have good computer skills maybe design things for people, cleaning, ect.     Think about you and what you enjoy doing and what would be age apporiate and start some brainstorming ideas I am sure you will come up with some options. Also ask friends what they do, and if any one knows of anything.

Yes, she still sleeps with it.  She divides her time between our house and her boyfriend's house since she is going back to school and has not been able to find a full time job.  Her blanket stays here, though, because her boyfriend gives her some good natured ribbing whenever he sees it.  It is in terrible, ragged shape with all the stuffing coming out of it with plenty of rips and tears.  I don't have any problems with her sleeping with it and I imagine when she moves out, it'll go with her, probably tucked at the bottom of her cedar chest.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I have a blanket, which I called "Kiki", and I still sleep with it.

Once in awhile when I get homesick, I pull out my baby blanket.  Even if it's just to fold it up and use it as a pillow while I watch TV, it reminds me of my childhood, and gives me some comfort.  I really don't think it's odd at all.  Most people have a comfort item, and it can change as we grow older and mature.  You might have a favorite picture that makes you smile when you see it, or even a fun mug that brightens your day when you have your morning coffee.  Either way, it's all the same.
wphLaVs6aa	My son has been eating the following fruit cut into chunks since he was 8 months old:<br>  <br>  - kiwi<br>  - very ripe cantaloupe<br>  - baked apple (so it's soft)<br>  - ripe mago<br>  - ripe papaya<br>  <br>  At about 10 months, we added:<br>  <br>  - cut grapes (pretty small pieces)<br>  - cut blue berries<br>  - pear chunks<br>  <br>  All your baby needs right now is breastmilk or formula, so I wouldn't worry too much about making sure your daughter is getting enough fruits.

Fd4lITkvaa	Drink a lot of water and nurse, nurse, nurse. Don't give bottles of pumped milk or supplement with formula, just nurse. At two weeks your baby is also entering a growth spurt so might be nursing more due to that as well. Our bodies are amazing and only need 24-48hrs to start producing more milk with proper stimulation, it's supply and demand. <br>  <br>  My son is 11 months old and my supply went up to accommodate him when he had a stomach bug and didn't want solid foods at all. Don't pay attention to how much milk comes out with the pump, it's not reliable. I was shocked to see my breasts leaking for the first time in months after only 24 hours of exclusive breastfeeding.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, if you're sick and get dehydrated, your supply will temporarily drop.  Also, after the first couple of weeks, your supply begins to equalize to meet baby's needs without a lot of extra.<br>  <br>  Keep nursing and your supply will come back up.  <br>  <br>  (It's not clear? Are you exclusively pumping?  If so, you need to be pumping more often.  THe pump isn't as efficient as the baby in stimluating your supply.)|`|7hTFflJ3aa	Your supply will rebound. Drink LOTS of water and rest as much as you can. You will find that this happens quite often for many different reason. You can also try a bowl of oatmeal, (if your feeling up to it). Also, around 2 weeks some babies hit a growth spurt so its possible he is eating extra so you dont have as much to pump.|`|19f922ca9c2b47e3ee7116248c9a73f1aa	Your illness is likely what caused the drop in supply.  Get as much rest as possible, drink plenty of fluids, and nurse as much as possible.  Your supply should pick up in a couple of days.  I experienced this a couple of weeks ago and it bounced right back.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	after about 2 weeks your supply will level down to what is needed (the first 2 weeks is always pretty abundant until its leveled..you could also be a bit dehydrated from being sick.. drink a TON of water. Don't worry, your child will not go hungry.

U9pnPXnpaa	You said that YOU need her to be more independent.  However, until she decides to be more independent there is nothing you can do about it.    If she likes the arrangements you are stuck.   She still lives at home and therefore is subject to the rules of her parents while she is there.       If she graduated 2 years ago why is she still living there?       You either accept the way things are and deal with it or you cut your losses and move on.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Sounds like your gf is still relying on her parents for a lot of things. First, she CAN go have her parents reomved from her account, or even open a new one that does not give them access.  She CAN go take her car somewhere else.  But what you dont mention...  WHY is she letting them pay for it?  Is she dependant on them to pay for it?  Is the car in their name?  I just cant fathom why she would be sooo afraid of making her parents mad unless they are her primary means of support.      Well, whether its purse strings or something else, she needs to break the ties.  YES, her parents will be mad at first, but if they actully do love her, they will get over it, and before she knows it they will be fine.  She needs to stand up for what she wants and do what she wants instead of letting someone else rule her life.  And she needs to start with her own job and her own place to live instead of relying on them to provide these things for her.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	You're right, they are treating her like she is in high school.  Of particular concern is their total control over her finances.  If her name is on the account, though, she can go to the bank and copies of her bank statements or check her balances online.  Unfortunately the only person who can change this is her.  She will have to grow a steel spine and become independent of them financially; this will include moving out of their house and into her own place with or without a roommate.      If you two marry, this will continue to be an issue, especially if grandchildren come along.  Control freaks don't give up control easily.  You have to keep stating your boundaries and enforcing them.  They should not have a key to your girlfriend's house, or they'll probably be in there at all times.  Since they are "traditional" they will probably respect your position as her husband.  This could give you some leverage when stating the rules.      It all boils down to what does your GF want to do?  Is she just mildly frustrated, or fed up enough to make the change?  You may need to find out exactly where she is with this, because it will determine whether or not you have a future together.|`|IsnHXRo4aa	Bottom line if she is going to be an independent person she needs to start soon. 23 and still living with parents is fine, working for them ok... but letting them totally control your life and finances is not ok. Advice is one thing, this is a whole different story. Let her know you feel that she needs to trust herself to make her own decisions. Maybe she's insecure and needs some confidence boosters. Maybe she feels like pleasing her parents is the only way she can be loved by them. I'm sure that's not true, but her parents are going to have to let her know that. If she does something that upsets her parents, she will have to be able to let go of the guilt trip they're going to put on her. It may never change, and if it does, it's going to be an uphill battle. You are not going to have a happy relationship until she starts acting like an adult.|`|zEYjJ7Xhaa	it sounds like your girlfriend needs to grow up and move out of Mom and Dad's and get her own bank account.  she is 23.  if she can't / won't I would have serious concerns if I were you.  This won't change in fact will get worse if you ever have kids.|`|v64IwD5xaa	I'm not sure if theres anything you can do but deal with it. It all depends on how your girlfriend feels. If she's fine with having her parents control many aspects of her life, well than she's got some growing up to do, and maybe its time for you to move on. If she feels like they're overprotective, and she wants to get out, She's got to confront them on her own. You have been dating her for 16 months, but she's known her parents her whole life. It wouldn't be right for u to intervene in this kind of family situation. You sound very upset. I'm sure your girlfriend probably knows that you are. I agree with you that this whole situation is kind of ridiculous. It is time for your girlfriend to take care of her own car, and have control over her finances. But she needs to come to that decision herself. Pressuring her, or her family will only contribute to more bad feelings. What u need to do, is evaluate the situation, and see if its all worth it, and know that if it is, u will probably have to wait around for a while. good luck.
scdOdaTKaa	You could very well be pregnant.  Here was my experience this month...I missed my period in December, had some spotting but that was it, very not like me. So my AF was due the 23rd.  I had mild cramping mid January, then the week before AF i Had some cramping that went away, not like me. I really thought I was pregnant.  I had no other PMS symptoms, nothing that is usual for me at least.  I had heavy breats, not sore just heavy, I had some dizzy spells, increased appetite, etc.  Then I was 3 days late, I woke up with no warning and there it was. This AF is one of the worst I've had in years.  So I hope you get your BFP, but to me is sounds like AF is on it's way. Hope I'm wrong.  Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|pFDu5I3Uaa	It could be. I am feeling the same way but I am not sure yet. I would wait and test if you miss. Good Luck
9p9DDRSnaa	I bought this...I did the introductory at $20 but they sent me a whole crap load of stuff!...it has videos, flash cards and books.  It basically starts your child on the first disc and recommends you show it to your child twice a day...I have a dvd player in the truck so my daughter watches it on the way to and from daycare...the video shows a word like "HI" it has a cursor that runs underneath the word as it is being said...they always repeat the word twice...in a nutshell, when you read a book to your child, use your finger underneath the word as you are saying it.  it starts on basic words such as hi, baby, elephant, camel, arms up, arms down etc...it shows the word, repeats it twice then shows a child performing these actions (or the appropriate animal).  The first disc also has the songs "twinkle, twinkle little star" and the "itsy bitsy spider"...the songs also show the words with the cursor underneath...I think it helps...my daughter is 15 months and about two weeks ago she pointed to a ball and said "ball"...She absolutely loves the flash cards that comes with it and is doing her best to destroy them...lol...I would reccommend it but I would not pay $200 for it...just ask them for the sample pack or intro rate....I saw this on tv and called...hope I helped....oh yeah, they say to watch one video a month...we are on the second video and they do teach phonics, ie...sitting, walking...all that good stuff.|`|nNRMOITEaa	yea i've heard of it i would so want to buy it but thats's alot of money you know i figure i can just do it on my own by  buying flash cards and dvds and just teach my son by myseld well with his dad too and the help of family just mimic what you see them doing in the informercial but it does seem like a good program!    good luck hun|`|mjlhZAVxaa	My mom used "Sing, Spell, Read and Write" she home schooled my sisters (not me) and I was reading at age 2.  But my sister played "school" with me, so she really taught me!  I still have the program and use the tapes that my mom used to have.  I looked them up on-line and they are still around!    http://www.singnlearn.org/khxc/index.php...  That is just one of the sites that carries their stuff.  Just google it.  The songs are catchy and teach you how to pronounce the alphabet, making it easier to learn how to read.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	"Your Baby Can Read" does not actually teach your baby to read- it teaches your baby to memorize.  In the long run, it could actually delay your baby's reading development.  They need to learn phonics, so they can teach themselves words, instead of memorizing every, single word in the English language.  Forget the $200 and just read to your baby.  It's the best thing you can do.  And let your baby be a baby for the time being.  No need to rush the milestones.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	you can do the same this "program" does by just sitting down and reading to your child. Save yourself the $200|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	I have heard of the learning system but have not used it.  You can do the same thing on you own.  Reading to your child will create vocabulary and word recognition in your child.  You can even make your own flash cards if you want by cutting pictures out of magazines and gluing them to index cards with the word beneath it.  I wouldn't buy the system because I can't afford the $200.  I could use that money for diapers, daycare, and formula.|`|rF1fpyenaa	i looked into it too and it is way overpriced.  i thought it might be something like $39.95 or something.  they are kidding with that $200 price tag.  don't know anyone who has done it but agree with the answer that said it only teaches memorization which is not reading at all.  save your money.  i hope someone gives you a cheap alternative.  there has to be one out there.  good luck.

CDsLUCXUaa	i think you're making more of a fuss over this then your daughter|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I think you need to get over it.  Concealing what you're doing with the new baby will just make your 2yo jealous and might make her feel like you're doing something bad if you don't want her seeing.  It's a natural part of life and I think it's cute that a little girl wants to BF her baby dolls.  How precious.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	would u feel comfy using a drape over your breast? or wearing a sling type thing that she could be in while feeding? i agree, formula is not the devil; if u need to do that to be comfortable, i would....if you are uncomfortable nursing  you child, they may very well pick up on the tension, not to mention it may interfere with their feeding....do what you feel is right and don't let anyone tell  you different|`|yCwPxulYaa	I have not had this issue.  To me, breastfeeding is a natural part of life.  God made breast to feed our children, not to be sexual.  I think I would explain this to my older child and answer questions that she may have.  I don't think you should be embarrassed to feed your child.  You wouldn't be embarrassed to feed that child a bottle in front of your children/husband.    My husband loves to be a part of me feeding OUR child.  I would let him be part of it if we were bottle feeding, why would I not let him be part of it since I am breastfeeding.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I'm not quite clear why it's 'gross' for a toddler to play at breastfeeding. I used to work at a preschool, and many of the kids (boys too!) did this with their dolls.   It was very cute.      Nursing a baby is, as you know, completely natural.  If you feel uneasy doing it front of your older child, you can do is discreetly (as you would when nursing in public -- just let your shirt drape over your breast), or involve your toddler with a toy before you sit down to nurse.  But eventually she IS going to notice and ask.  Breasts don't have sexual connotations for a child this age, so you explain that this is how babies eat -- it's how SHE ate when she was a baby.    EDIT: Inappropriate? Would it be inapporpriate for a toddler to play at feeding a doll a bottle?    It sounds like you have some significant issues about your body and its natural processes.  That isn't somethng that anyone here can do anything about, but your feelings are NOT typical of most mothers.      You need to make your own choice.  If you are uncomfortable giving your child breastmilk, then you give formula. I would encourage you, if possible, to breastfeed for at least a brief time, to give your child the colostrum, but realistically if you are disgusted/distressed by the act of the breastfeeding you are not going to be able to do it for any length of time. So you need to do what works for you. (You probably 'dried up' the first time due to frequent bottles 'when out' and your emotional distress which inhibited let down.)|`|H74F8jxuaa	I would just drape a little cover over yourself and just go on about your business.  Go in the other room to start off and don't make a big deal out of it.  Just do your thing.|`|7fb7e659a2d89fef1b835dc202b88053aa	I have 4 year old twin boys and I am breastfeeding my new baby. They honestly haven't even really cared or paid much attention. You can discretely nurse a baby where it looks like you are just holding them. You think it's gross for a child to pretend to breastfeed a doll, but that is just continuing your problem on. Breastfeeding is a natural thing and girls shouldn't be taught that it's weird or wrong from the start. The child pretending to breastfeed is odd and makes people feel uncomfortable, but should it?! We have no problem with a child pretending to give a doll a bottle. I think you should nurse your new baby and try to get past whatever issues you have with it. Not letting your husband be around while nursing is a bit odd to me. Pumping I think would be even harder because you'd have to go off somewhere privately to pump! What would you do with your 2 year old and baby while you did that? I think you should spend your pregnancy  trying to be more comfortable with your body and it's design that was MEANT to breastfeed and get over it. Sorry if that sounds harsh. With my first baby I was a lot more private, I left restaurants to feed in the car in the winter, wouldn't nurse infront of anyone but my hubby. After nursing a daughter, twins for 1 year and now this one, I do it wherever and if someone has a problem with it THEY can leave. It is legal for a mom to breastfeed wherever she is legally allowed to be and I think we need to embrace this and pave the way for our daughters to have a more comfortable nursing experience.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	AOunds like you are a little too private if you are kicking out your husband. He has seen them right. Sorry- I would just cover up with a thin clothe to keep the 2yo from seeing. I doubt they will care anyways at that age|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I think you might be a little too shy with the breastfeeding. it is a perfectly natural thing and if you treat it as such, it shouldn't bother your two year old one bit. Explain to her that this is how babies eat and when she was a baby this is how she ate. I think this is why our society has such a problem with breastfeeding...people aren't viewing it as a natural and necessary way for babies to eat (yes even discreetly in public).    If more people(like yourself) start to make a change, society will adjust. It was not that long ago that any breastfeeding was controversial (and gross) so we have come a long way but still have a long way to go.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	This child came out of you!!  Seems sort of strange to be embarrassed by this, but why not just do it in private and not in front of the 2 year old?  Seems like the problem could be solved easily.|`|AA12243380	Well, I can understand your modesty.  I wasn't able to openly breastfeed in front of anyone other than my husband.  I was even uncomfortable around the nurses and the lactation consultant although I did allow them to watch me try to nurse because I was having problems getting them to latch.  It was very awkward.    That being said, I don't think that it's gross for a child to pretend to breastfeed and I am not modest around my toddlers.  My girls are almost 20 months old and they both bathe with me in the shower sometimes.  I have no problem nursing in front of them and they got a book as a gift which shows a mom breastfeeding her new baby.  I've been telling my girls that the baby is eating so they'll expect to see their baby brother eating that way.  One weird thing though... one of my girls pulled down my shirt last night and tried to nurse and said "eat" and I said "No!  You had your chance when you were a newborn, now stop pulling on mama's shirt."    lol    Either way, I think you're either going to have to get over your modesty issue or formula feed.    There is nothing wrong with formula feeding if you ask me and if you're that uncomfortable with your body then maybe it's the best option for you.    Good luck with your baby!          EDIT-Do you think that a toddler feeding her "baby" (doll) a bottle is inappropriate?  My toddlers feed their dolls bottles all the time.  To me feeding is feeding.  I can't understand your perspective on that one, I guess.  I don't see breastfeeding as dirty, though.  I am super shy about my own body and my friend is sending me a nursing coverup so I can nurse in public if I want to without being seen but I don't think it's wrong for anyone else to breastfeed openly.|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	I'm still trying to get past the "gross" and "highyl highly innappropriate" (sic) judgements about kids breastfeeding their dolls.  I can't see what's so wrong about children learning and imitating how babies are fed.    There are several good book on the market that talk about nursing in ways that toddlers understand and identify with.
33h5R8nTaa	My daughter is 7 months but i have worked in day cares and whatnot my whole life and helped potty train many kids. i always thought that the poop got smushed when it hit the diaper because it was pressed against there bottoms. He should be fine starting training, if you notice the poop doesnt look like regualr poop when he goes in the potty then talk to ur doc. But just see how it goes.
0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	sorry canadian snow bunny, I disagree with you.  I could just as easily call you lazy for using a stroller.  I did use a harness on my son from 1 - 2 years old.  I realize that not all children need them,  some children are more hyper than others and that is not a reflection on parenting.  My son was very active and impulsive, there is no way I would have let him walk without holding my hand/harness/leash.  I used all 3 at some point, but we both preferred the harness.  I prefer him to walk and get exercise,  he hated holding my hand, so we used to harness.  What's the harm? everyone was happy.  Now he's 3, and has more impulse control and can walk nicely next to me. Hands/stroller/leash are all forms of restraint, to say one is lazy and not the others is illogical, it's just a matter of personal preference.  My question will forever be.... why does anyone care what I use or anyone else uses???|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I have a doggy backpack one for my 13 mo old. I havent had to use it yet but I am not against using it when I have to. Like in a crowded zoo for example. she loves to run around and she doesnt like to hold hands. I would rather her be on a "leash" tehn running off and getting hurt before i can get to her<br>  <br>  and for those who will say you have to teach them to hold hands and stay by you dont have a very active and stubborn one year old.|`|4gZYucHMaa	Children have brains, they are very quick to learn if a parent teaches them. My kids knew at an early age if they wanted to walk then they needed to stay close to me and hold hands. I had a stroller for my kids and of course I was happythat  they wanted out but they knew the rules--no running away or else back in the stroller. <br>  <br>  I never felt the need to leash my kid. Kids need to be taught right from  wrong at an early age and they do know what they're doing especially if you take time to guide them.<br>  <br>  Unless your child can not understand the rules or is mentally impaired I don't see why they'd be used..Effective parenting does the trick unless as I said they're not able to understand  and it's for their safety but a healthy child and an effective in control parent should manage to keep their child safe.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT--Oh I'm sorry I didn't think I needed to spell it out but do I care what people do with their kids of course not, what do I care but the question is "'How do you feel...'' therefore I answered. If you got offended and clearly needed to thumbdown for your own insecurity, then I feel sorry for you--it's called an opinion people--duh!<br>  <br>  SPACECAT---clearly you don't know how to discipline your kids and teach them to be safe! Whát are you going to do when it's bike riding time, walking to school. You need to teach them how to do so safely, the earlier the better.The stroller was because I walked five miles a day and no child should have to walk that but thanks for coming out *clap* clap * clap* to you I find it hilarious that of all the people who've answered this and  said the same thing as I've said, you're offended so much by me--and of course don't allow emails so I can respond to you. Coward!|`|Od73sfkxaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with using them. My mother used one when I was little on all of us kids. Children don't realize the dangers of cars, strangers, or just getting lost. <br>  <br>  Plus I wouldn't want to get in trouble for being a negligent mother. We will probably use one when we have kids!<br>  <br>  Better safe than sorry.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	From knowing how I personally was younger and how hard headed he can seem at 19 days, we'll be wearing one. I was one to run off in stores and see him being the same way.<br>  <br>  Better a "leash" than a missing child.|`|zfZiXQ3Oaa	too kinky to use on a child.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I think they are an awesome resource for those parents/children that need them.  The tethers keep a child safe, and no matter how diligent we are with our children they ALL run off, get away, etc. at some point.  It is better that they be safely tethered to mom than a tragedy occured because Mom was helping one child tie a shoe, for instance, and the other one chased a butterfly into the road...|`|jLYTKr33aa	I feel it's another to each his own thing.  I have friend whose 4 - year - old son has autism and is completely nonverbal.  He tends to take off running without warning, and he's FAST!  He's also very big for his age; he's about the size of the average 7 - year - old.  If given the chance, he would run right into oncoming traffic without so much as giving the cars a glance.  She uses one for safety reasons, and I don't see how anyone could argue against it.<br>  Even if the child doesn't have special needs, I couldn't care less if someone wants to use one.  I personally never wanted or needed to use one, but that's just me.<br>  *ETA* Perhaps I should get one for my husband, as he's the type who gets easily bored on shopping trips and tends to wander away from me.  =)|`|BzvstX7uaa	I really like the ones that look like teddybear backpacks but have the leash and handle for mom.<br>  <br>  They are great for active little ones in places like:<br>  Malls<br>  Theme parks<br>  Fairs<br>  Airports<br>  etc<br>  <br>  When you have a child like mine, who is active and energetic, it's great to have that. Better to have one than to lose your child. Things happen. Better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  EDIT: SPACECAT you are brilliant and I could not have said it any better myself.  *claps for you* seriously =) amen sister|`|6f54cfe561a33f4d3976270a0c53628caa	ha! I used to be one to make fun of all the kids on leashes!!! <br>  until I went to 6flags with my 21 month old daughter 8 months pregnant!!! my 26 month old neice had one & my daughter did not! man i wish i got 1!!!!<br>  you can't always keep an eye on your kids 24/7, especially if you have 2 young ones! better safe then sorry<br>  as far as the poster above me... that stuff could happen either way, you still need to watch the kids!<br>  i also like the full harness ones with the monkey backpacks & you hold the tail, so cute you hardly notice its a leash!<br>  (btw don't mind the grammar, i'm typing 1 handed since i'm feeding my baby now!)|`|be68e6d198f3f9ac69efb2146c8d907eaa	I am going to buy a full harness for my daughter soon!  I know some people think they are cruel but my thought is, which is more cruel having a leash on them or having them get hit by a car or kidnapped?  I am visually impaired and can't keep my eyes on her at all times.  I see this "leash" as a wonderful help to us!!|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I used to think they were ridiculous but my sister has a son who was a runner and 2 other children as well she had to use it to keep him safe from running so she didn't have to decide whether to run after her oldest or stay with her youngest ones.|`|haabfMtkaa	I think in surtan situations (amusment parks etc.) they are a life saver. I like the full harness but i think with older children the hand is ok too|`|pnL5WTXMaa	they are ridiculous. watch your kid and you won't need one.|`|K8le7LRkaa	Personally I don't like them at all.  I have to agree with everything "Canadian Snow Bunny" said.  If you raise your children to understand they need to stay with you then they will.   Communicate with your child.  <br>  <br>  I believe pets belong on leashes, not humans.
723QHuicaa	Sophie had this - it freaked the hell out of me. Its called (if its the same thing) ''Urticaria''<br>  <br>  Sophie developed hers as she had a virus at the time. I didnt know this at first as all that was wrong with her was a cough. So when the rash appeared, I freaked out and took her to the out of hours dr. The rash came and went pretty quickly. It moved and was concentrated to her limbs.<br>  <br>  The dr told me she had a virus and was displaying an allergic reaction to the virus. He could not treat the virus itself, but he could control the rash. he gave me 'Benadryl' for kids - not sure if you all have that over the pond, but an anti-histamine - which controlled the rash and she was fine in 2 days.<br>  <br>  Calebs rash looks a lot like Sophie's did - almost identical, and the fact its coming and going makes me think its the same also.<br>  <br>  definately get a drs opinion though, and in the meantime, try an anti-histamine and see if it does anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  **** I'm lying, it was 'Piriton' for kids, but same thing, just caught a glimpse of it in the cupboard lol|`|hJoB7VR1aa	He is having a skin reaction to something. My daughter has severe allergies and I can tell you that they are worse when they are sleeping. That is my daughter insist on being wrapped in a blanket causing her to get hot and sweaty making the dermatitis (skin allergic reaction) worse.<br>  Has he had any new foods? New lotion?|`|2N6KEoVqaa	My sister gets hives like these if her skin doesn't get enough air- like if she is in a warm bath or under a lot of layers of clothing or bundled up in bed. Kind of sounds like that could be causing it? They always went away fairly quickly as well.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	I think its bull crap that your doctor doesn't want to see him. I would start going to a different doctor. If you think it needs to be looked at right away I would take him to your local urgent care office today or tomorrow morning.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	The only thing i can think of, other than the food allergies, or detergents, is if yall have a cat, and maybe hes allergic its jumping into his crib, and when he goes to sleep it starts to get to him. Why dont you try expirementing any way you can that way you can be helpful at the drs office. Maybe put him in his crib tonight, and then for tomorrows nap, let him sleep in your bed, and see if he still wakes up with it. Try washing all of his linens. Try googling it and looking at pictures of other rashes on toddlers, and see what you can find.|`|qayCggxMaa	The rash your son has looks like hives.  They are frequently caused by an allergic reaction.  Since he keeps having it after times he is in bed (when he wakes up in the morning and after nap), maybe something somehow got in his bed that he is allergic to.  I'm betting he's sleeping in short sleeves?  Maybe even shorts too or his pajama pants ride up his legs when he sleeps?  Either way (or even without those conditions) arms and legs are most easily exposed in the bed probably.  Since you say you haven't switched detergents, maybe something just tracked into bed one day on his clothes, or maybe it's gotten infested with dust mites or something.  I'd start by washing his sheets and blankets in hot water and seeing if things improve.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My son has sensitive skin and gets all sorts of rashes-But I've never seen one like that. I'm not trying to scare you and it's probably no big deal, but you may want to call his DR's office and describe the rash to a nurse (if you didn't the first time you called). <br>  <br>  Oh and that's 100% not eczema!|`|yCwPxulYaa	Has he been on antibiotics recently?<br>  <br>  I am a nurse and that looks like a classic penicillin rash.<br>  <br>  What inked mama said is also highly possible if he has not been on antibiotics.  Has he been sick at all recently?<br>  <br>  Take a picture with you when you go to the doctors office.|`|zTKJN5wWaa	may be its because of mattress...try changing bed altogether, I hope it disappears after that,|`|AA11537580	if he is only getting it after being in bed then look there!<br>  <br>  new toy?<br>  <br>  well it looks like an allergy but I wouldn't know what specifically.<br>  It looks like what my daughter had last summer when she got a bug bite but it didn't get better , it bit her while we where camping, it didn't bother her at all but i had it checked and that's what it was a bug bite.|`|WPI0Z47saa	If it is only when he is waking up then I would seriously think it was something with his bedding. I know you said that nothing has changed but I had a problem where I used the same deoderant for years and in the middle of the same pack, came packed in 3's, I developed an allergy out of no where and can't use it anymore. Or maybe it is something with the washer machine not rinsing the clothes properly. Try having him sleep somewhere else for a nap and see if he still awakens with it. This would at least give you more input to tell the doctor such as when he sleeps somewhere else it doesn't happen or it happens no matter where he sleeps. My son get rashes like that if I tough him after putting lotion on my hands. I didn't know why until I found out that he was allergic to aloe. So maybe it could be something on you like lotion or perfume or even dish soap and since you touch him to put him down for naps it may irritate his skin.Good luck.
fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	It sounds like it would be a good move for you.  Where would your boyfriend stay if you moved?  That would have to be a decision he would have to make.  You have to make the decision that would be best for your kids.  Pray about it.    If he wants to wait until he is older to marry you, tell him, there is no time like the present.  We can't wait forever because things come quicker than what you think.  That is an excuse, to me.  He sounds scared. He has two children with you and he loves you.  Why not marry and work things out together?    I think it is a good idea to move to be with your family.  I pray he will come with you and not to let the disease get him down.  I know there are different types of lupus and it affects everyone differently.      I will pray for you and your situation.  I pray that you can make the right decisions for all of you.    God Bless.|`|0VJE7BXmaa	I have a couple of questions about the move...Where will you live?  With your aunt?  Is there a job waiting for you?  help with the nursing home, you mean, a job at the nursing home, and you will be paid?  It sounds like this is an excellent opportunity to move close or with family.  What do you mean, she moves a lot?  You mean within the city, or around the state?  Since everyone around you is extremely unstable, it is up to you to create stability for your children.  You cannot rely on the father of your children.  If you are having to work 2 jobs, and he refuses to marry you when you are the mother of 2 of his children I would not wait on him.  It is up to him to decide to follow you, or to provide for you.  I'm sorry, but it just doesn't sound like you can count on him or his family for stability.  So... you are not obligated to support him, and be his stability, you just have an obligation to your children.  Would he be willing to move to Florida with you or close to you?  What about your aunt, is she married, would she have a father figure for your children?  What about your parents, are they alive, could you move in with them or near to them?  I would suggest getting a 2 bedroom apartment either where you are now, or in Florida near family, give your children the bedroom, and sleep on the couch.  Quit one of your jobs, and work one full time job, and spend more time with your children.  I'm sure you would qualify for some government assistance, welfare?, childcare vouchers?, etc. until you can get on your feet.  You are single, and with 2 children.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	lets discuss this|`|HjO6eCP7aa	You are not wrong in any kind of way. Last year when i go deployed to Iraq I wasnt married yet i was gonna wait till i got back but i wasnt married and my fiancee had my daughter were worried bout if i died cuz i wasnt able to put life insurance in her name yet. My mom understood and told her she would give her some and a lawyer made us all 3 sign a paper so you could try that the money would only b used for my daughter though you would have to gree on that.

I'll do my best to tell you what I believe...    Your two children come first.  Before anyone.  Make sure they are safe and in a stable environment.  Move, if you have to, but make sure it is not to another temporary location.  Expect to put down roots for at least 5 years wherever you go.    It is sorry that your boyfriend has a disease and can't work.  You've got other things to take care of (cold of me, I know) but you can't look after two young kids and tend to a grown man at the same time.  It will be very draining on you.    Secondly, you need to better yourself so that you can take even better care of your children.  If that means going to school, then do it.  Do what you need to do so that you can be earning a decent wage, and showing to your kids what dedication and hard work will be able to do for people.  You'll need a lot of strength to get through this.  Do it for your children.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	youre being smart - you want to set up a good life for you and your kids and that's commendable.  i'd look out for you and your kids first.  your bf is just a a bf, he's not a husband.  your kids have to come first.

Because of the BFN and the bleeding, sounds like AF to me.|`|OP5XqYt1aa	maybe go to your doctor.. they can do a blood test that will confirm it.. not all preg tests are accurate! x|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	If you read the test after 10 minutes, it was most likely and evaporation line and shouldnt be counted. although it is VERY rare, some women have been known to still have period like bleeding, but by this point if you were pregnant you would have gotten a positve already. More than likely it is just a light period.
hL6MGrMoaa	Nothings wrong the hormones in your body are surging. Take some tylenol, drink plenty of pure water all the time, and lay down with a cold cloth on your head.|`|kT7GVOosaa	Tylenol is good to take when you are pregnant. you can even have extra strength. but yes it is normal to have headaches.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Although very uncomfortable headaches during pregnancy are very common. It alone doesn't mean anything is wrong at all. If you're having them with other symptoms like dizziness and swollen feet, hands or face then it could mean something else. You can take Tylenol. I had really bad headaches during the beginning of my pregnancy and would have to take 2 Tylenol just to get some sleep some days. Hope you get relief soon!|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Ask your doctor. They say Tylenol is fine, but i'm not sure yet because you're in such an early stage. I had the same thing around the same time, and it was from lack of caffeine. I drank at least a soda or 2 a day, and when I found out I was pregnant, I stopped drinking them completely. And I started getting horrible headaches. I went to the ER and they said it was from caffeine withdrawl and to slowly decrease the amount. I don't know if that's your case or not though. Just call your doctor to make sure.|`|VGoCh2C9aa	headaches are common in pregnancy especially at the beginning, i had bad headaches till about 16weeks, they have eased off a lot now but occassionally do get them. the doctor just recommended paraceptamal but if you are worried go and ask your doctor for advice.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	I'm 32 weeks, and I get them everyday.  I know how you feel.
DuLhv7Ajaa	If this is your first, You'll start to see the belly bulge around 4 months, but don't worry give it time and you'll be huge!! LOL|`|AOfm8ey6aa	With my first baby I started to show around 7 months! By 9 months I looked like other ladies when about 5 months pregnant. My baby was a healthy 6 pounder. Now with my second baby I started to show around 4-5 months so much earlier. Now I am 34,5 weeks and still look kinda small althought I feel HUGE. :D I am average weight woman, 5'5".|`|HPRlEWu1aa	This is my 1st pregnancy. Im 5`1 115 lbs and im 10 weeks and have a little bulge. Its not bloating or constipation. My stomach looks different then it did a month ago. My diet hasn't changed. I haven't gained anything. My tumy is just different|`|4AEhBAMBaa	Depends on your body; everyone is different. I never really showed.|`|AA12276639	my best friend started showing at 5 1/2 months  it just depends on your body type and how it reacts

AA10424047	Yes, it's normal. Around 10-12 weeks, hcg levels start to level out as the placenta takes over. Up until the placenta takes over around 12 weeks, hcg hormone and the yolk sac support the pregnancy. When the placenta does take over, the hcg levels begin to level out, stop doubling normally and the yolk sac disappears.    As long as there is a heartbeat, your baby is fine.    Good luck!|`|AA10506024	As my  contact .. I wish I could help.. ????    I just say.. trust your instint and pray a lot..   I am sure U will have have a wonderful healthy baby..  Congrats....

Good luck and best wishes!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	As long as your levels are still going up, your body is holding the pregnancy. If there were a cause for concern, one of the drs would have told you already. They know best. Hopefully for you upcoming appt you will see that it is fine. Good luck!
jOBBlJnvaa	I work as an account executive for an advertising agency...I have clients that I take care of through projects. I had my little guy in the middle of a couple projects. What I did was work all the way up until I had my baby, but everyday before i left the office I would type out exactly where all of my projects stood so who ever had to step in and take over could do so seamlessly. I know how hard it is when you are used to doing everything your self. Or you can pick a day like 37 weeks pregnant and end it there.|`|9GuqdXa2aa	I'd go to 36wks|`|bP5zyipXaa	soon as posible your going to need time to get everything in order .than if you have an early birth you will leave the office in an uproar as you have a lot of responsibilties so id do it end of next week
paHbLR9aaa	I put my daughter in a toddler bed when she was 18 months.  The first night, I slept in the floor beside her.  I was really afraid she would either fall out or get up and play in the middle of the night.  She did fine, fell out maybe 3 times for the first month or so.  I agree that 12 months is a little early for a toddler bed.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	Every child is different.<br>  I put my daughter in a toddler bed once she tried to climb out of her crib.  She is doing great!<br>  Just like potty training there isn't a magic age. It depends on the child. One thing you might want to keep in mind is this. You may have to put your child back in bed a few times until the child is use to the new change.<br>  ~What ever you chose I wish you the best~|`|SA1y0lm1aa	i put my 2 sons in a toddler bed at 2 years of age but my baby girl is a year and a half and i thought she might be ready for a toddler bed and we tried it out and it was a big no..... she climbed out ever 2 minuets all night long so it was back into the crib for her till she is 2 and can stay in the toddler bed........|`|tle3AGJraa	I know people who do the transition as early as 10 months old.  I wouldn't recommend it, but to each his own.<br>  <br>  I waited with my first until she was 3 years old.  For us, it worked out better.  As soon as we switched to a toddler bed, she started getting out of bed at night and trying to get into bed with us.  So for about a month, I had to get out of bed and take her back.  It didn't last long, but on those nights, I was wishing she was still in her crib because she never tried to get out and slept peacefully all night long.<br>  <br>  It's basically one of those 'your best judgment' calls.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|drOXfPM6aa	You should do it when you know he is ready. The last thing you want is for him to wake up in the middle of the night to only wander around and get hurt. Personally I would keep him in the crib until he can figure out how to escape or is 2 years old.|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	my son was 3 when we put him in a toddler bed...we didnt want to rush it and it turned out to be a perfect time. he loved his bed when he seen it and knew what it was...also he has not gotten up once in the middle of the night and it's been 3 months.|`|EGpFJXDhaa	My son was 10 months old when we got him a toddler bed. He would not sleep in his crib. Not soon after that we went straight to a twin size bed...I think his problem was he just was more comfortable with more room.|`|d6ASNpNsaa	I have a 2 year old.  I put him into a toddler bed when he started climbing in and out of his crib.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	my daughter is 16 months and a week . we bought the one that said you can start at 15 months .  shes been in it for 3 weeks now and done great expect last 3 days|`|YBQvzEhGaa	My pediatrician says not until they try to climb out of their crib.  I put my son in a toddler bed at 2 and he just went into a twin bed last week (he's three).
ZSSUfSXwaa	Well $500 dollars is quite a bit for a travel system!   And as for what age kids need strollers I would say till they're able to walk for long periods of time- usually by 2 ish they prefer to walk, unless you go on crowded places or long walks... but I'll say completely out of a stroller at age 3.    As for which stroller... well there are loots of strollers!   But a nice average travel system will cost you around $300 tops     http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    This one is one of the most expensive ones at Babies R Us and it's made by Chicco... I love the carseat! And the stroller looks very nice and comfy and not too bulky!! :))  http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    Sometimes with fancy strollers what happens is that they are very bulky and it's like manouvering a car when you're in a busy mall or grocery store! And unfortuntately many stores arent made for moms with strollers and the bigger your stroller the most uncomfortable it is to walk around...|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Wow that's expensive to say LOL. I had bought my son's travel system from walmart and we went with a winnie the pooh theme. Take a look this is what I bought.  http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	Chicco Travel System not $500 more like $275 or so|`|oXzHvsBpaa	This is the one that we have:    http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    You usually need it till they are able to walk for long periods and well on their own. Usually around 3 maybe. We are going to use it till he out grows it. Just seems easier to push him around then to have him walk. Espically if you only have a certain amount of time to get things done.|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	We have the Baby Trend Mesa.  We like it a lot.  My son is big so he may only use the car seat that came with it for a few more months, however, we are planning on using the stroller until he is about 2 or 3.|`|bX9wJtG1aa	graco quattro tour systems seem to be very popular. i myself own a evenflo eurotrek system and i love it.|`|Ogq894zsaa	graco quatro tour systems are good we had an old style graco one and then upgrade to the quatro tour with this baby and it is great the stroller fits perfect in our  trunks and is so easy to open and operate and it is light so when you lift into a trunk it is easy. Also the car seats are great and the stroller has a 5 point harness which I love!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	honestly i am not sure how long they would want to ride in it, but it should have a weight limit for stroller and seat...i am sure at least  past the years where they may need to lay down and take a nap when they are out, so maybe older toddler years?
3defa348196fda3e86beb44c494d50e4aa	Oh man, I was in your exact position not too long ago. My girls are 5 years apart, did I want it that way, NO I didn't. Now, I wouldn't want it any other way. I took 4 months to conceive my first and 3 years, yes 3 years to conceive my 2nd. My lesson I learned is that you can not plan out everything in your life - some things are just meant to be. My oldest daughter is the biggest help to me. She is absolutely lovely with her sister. I have a friend with children 3 years apart and they fight constantly. The age difference between my 2 is wonderful, they do not fight as my oldest knows how to accomadate my younger one. I wouldn't want it any other way and you will see when your second one comes along that things will be just perfect for your family!!!|`|AA12150541	I just had my 3rd 6 month ago and she is 4+ years from my other 2.  It has been great because my older ones help out like crazy!  and they are great entertainers when i need a break.  we will most likely trying for 1 one more when she turns one.<br>  good luck!|`|4JgSq2rlaa	4 YEARS IS NOT TOO MUCH I KNOW OTHER MOTHERS TO HAVE MORE THAN THAT<br>  <br>  AT LEAST UR FIRST KID CAN HELP YOU E.G. TELL THEM TO PASS U THINGS ETC ITS NOT ALL BAD<br>  <br>  DONT THINK ABOUT IT WHEN UR ALREADY BLESSED WITH A CHILD SOME PEOPLE CAN EVEN CONCIEVE<br>  <br>  TAKE CARE AND GOOD LUCK TRYING|`|zATQaiwIaa	My s\o and i waited till just before our daughters 4rth birthday - she will be 5 a couple months after our son arrives.  My s\o and his brother are 6 years a part and they are actually very close.  I have 2 younger sisters - we are all within 3.5 years of each other and i really think it was way to close.<br>  I had originally wanted to try for another when our daughter was 2 - but financially it was just not a good idea.  Im glad we waited now though....our daughter is super excited about being a big sister and will be able to 'help out'; also the fact that she will be in school rather than child care all day is a huge help!  Sometimes waiting works out for the best.  <br>  Dont be in a huge rush for your 3rd child either - enjoy the milestones of your second!  If you didnt it would shortchange you and the child!|`|2l7lbcJWaa	OK so I'm not a mother, but I wanted to tell you I am almost 20 and have 3 sisters, 18, 15,  and 13. My 15 year old sister and I are so close! I love her and take care of her and she takes care of me too...she gives me advice all the time and she's so mature for her age (probably because she hangs out with me so much and I'm 5 years older). I just think there are a lot of upsides to having kids further apart. For one thing, your 4 year old is old enough to be a huge help with the new baby. Also, your daughter had 4 years of you all to herself! Once you have that baby it will never be all about her again, she will have to share mommy. It's good that she'll be old enough to understand things when all this happens. She will be old enough to watch out for her little sister instead of being jealous. Anyway, sorry I answered even though I'm not a mother, I just love my five-years-younger sister so much and I know everything will workout for you even though there's an age difference. My sister that is 1 1/2 years younger than me is so completely different from me that we will probably never be very close. <br>  <br>  Good luck and DON'T WORRY! It all works out in the end.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I don't have this problem with my own son, since I only have the one, and he's only 2, but I can speak from experience since I have much older siblings! I'm 24, and I have 4 older brothers and sisters, the youngest being 30, and the oldest being almost 45. I know you're not talking about there being that big a difference, but I have lots of friends with siblings who are 4 or more years older, and they get along great! I personally love having older siblings, especially since two are sisters with their own children. We can share so much, I have neices and nephews, and they have so much advice to give! I hope I helped a little bit, and good luck! I'm sure you'll have one soon, and maybe later you could even look into adopting a baby, to lessen the age gap! Happy early birthday to your little girl!!!|`|SFMwVJojaa	I have 4 children, between numbers 1 and 3 and 2 and 4 i have just over 4 years. Its absolutely fine, they are old enough to feel important being the big brother / sister, can help with little jobs, love the hero worship they get. They may not be best of friends but they all enjoy each others company and the older ones feel so proud if they've taught the younger ones something. The main thing to remember is that for the gap to be successful you have to look at the positives, and at least you'll have had time to devote to elder one and can make them feel valued for themselves, rather than just rushing around all the time!<br>  good luck!|`|XVljoYZ5aa	4 years apart isn't a bad thing! I know its more of a gap than you planned, but things don't always go as planned for reasons we don't always see right away! Think of it this way: Your daughter got at least 4 full years of being "the baby" so she has less of a chance of resentment. Also, things will be much easier for you, especially with your older daughters help (getting diapers, soothing the baby with a paci)! You'll have more time to save up for college in between children, and of course, baby #2 and #3 can be very close if you so choose.
SEzIkGNiaa	Weaning is the process of gradually introducing a mammal infant, either human or animal, to what will be its adult diet and withdrawing the supply of its mother's milk.    The process takes place only in mammals, as only mammals produce milk. The infant is considered to be fully weaned once it no longer receives any breast milk (or bottled substitute).    Normally, at the end of the weaning process, mammals experience reduced lactase production, becoming lactose intolerant. This is estimated to be the case with 70% of humans, with the rest being lactase persistent.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	In UK weaning generally means starting solid foods.  In the US the term weaning generally means stopping breast or bottle feeding and starting with sippy cups.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	weaning from what? weaning from breastbeeding to formula? breastfeeding to bottle? bottle to sippy cup? mashed foods to solids? formula to whole milk?|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	It could mean weaning onto solid foods, it could mean weaning off of the bottle, it could mean weaning off of the breast. How old is your baby and how are you feeding?|`|4YIUxSlYaa	In America weaning is when the baby goes from bottle to cup - this should be done around 1 year.    In the Uk weaning is when you start introducing solid foods - this should be done around 4-6months.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	In England weaning is when you start to introduce solids into the baby's diet.    In America it seems to be when you stop breastfeeding and giving formula.|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	Don't panic. Goto http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/agesandstages/...    BUT don't let anyone but your baby tell you when to do it. He/she will do it in their own time. My younger daughter carried on breast feeding to 13 months (probably for comfort as much as nutrition) and needed to b e weaned slowly. We found out afterwards that she's allergic to cows milk and once she was off it things went along well.
AA11920812	I cut out all sweets. And, I am a tea drinker so I just nixed the sugar. I was very careful about sugars. Including carbs - had a lot of high fiber foods. Everything that was brown or orange!<br>  <br>  I actually failed the first screening. And, followed this for the second screening (the three hour one) and my glucose was below 100. My doc was impressed, and I just kept on it.
3Rr5SAhhaa	Wow, starting the big gifts early... :) You can always get her more things for what she already has, like barbie/doll clothes/accessories, houses, etc. Or since she has everythign already, plan a trip to disneyland or another amusement park for her birthday.|`|drOXfPM6aa	You could get her:<br>  Ipod<br>  Portable video gaming system<br>  Cell phone (Prepaid)<br>  Membership to a fun childrens place (Zoo, Ect)<br>  Dance lessons
zwctZ812aa	probably just a bad dream.  If he starts really freaking out, talk to your doctor because he may be having night terrors.  If he usually calms down fairly easily, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  My neice has night terrors and my brother will have to get her out of bed and get her in the bath and be pretty much yelling at her to wake her up cuz she is freaking out.  It's pretty scary, so I hope your son doesn't develop those.  I think it's pretty normal for young children to have bad dreams, just keep an eye on it.|`|AA10322267	Yes, it could just be a bad dream, or a colic, or it is too hot or cold for him... My son used to do the same but he growth and it stopped. Sometimes we put the air conditioner and that prevented him to cry (even if it was not hot). Good luck.|`|J6jZLt0caa	Lately that's been happening to my son too. He's 1. And he cries with sentiment. It breaks my heart cause I know that it's probably a bad dream. I know I shouldn't get him used to me running to him all the time but I do. I can't help it. I pick him up off his crib and I do the shh shh shh thing too. If that doesn't do it I lay him next to me and rub his back and either hum or do the shh shh shh some more. I've figured that because he knows that I'm there next to him he feels more "secure"... Not sure if that's what it is but he won't cry for the rest of the night. Try sleeping with him for a few nights. See if that helps.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would guess he's dreaming if he's asleep....

Congrats!|`|UQ0PoEfAaa	with my 1st pg i dint want to know (although i was dying to find out!!!) but i always had this image since i was young that im in the labour room, the baby pops out and we're holding our breath to find out what the mw announces, like "its a girl" or "its a boy", there was just something abt that moment. But i mc my 1st child at 8weeks, then 2nd pg was an ectopic, so now im pg 3rd time round, 3months now, and want to know the sex of my baby because of my previous misfortune, and also because when we talk about it, we can refer to the baby as 'he' or 'she' and secretly start shopping...but i never knew the ultrasound is never 100% accurate...thats disappointing...imagine decorating the room and finding out its the opposite sex! But surely u cant be mistaken if its a boy, u can normally see the lil willy dangling cant u??!lol|`|5545d2a19349ba1665bcc132f6adae6faa	I would like to know.

We are the minority these days.|`|dbafItLvaa	Good for you!  We are going to have a surprise, too, and we are definitely in the minority.  I just had my 18-week ultrasound yesterday, and it's hard to know that the tech knows if we're having a boy or girl, but we don't!  I knew it would be hard not to know, but it will be worth it when he or she is born!  Good luck!|`|yYSWs9Imaa	i would like to know. I'm 9 weeks pregnant and my husband and I have always said we'd find out the sex.    I think it will help us bond with the baby better, and prepair us for whats coming our way. I think with most pregnancys you get 'feelings' as it if its a girl or a boy, and if you've convinced yourself you're having a girl, and you get a boy you might be a bit disapointed and not able to bond with your little boy right away.    just my thoughts though! Hope you have a happy and healthy 9 months.|`|WO7WAP19aa	Hey, With my first we wanted to find out so we did! but on this baby we REALLY want to keep it a surprise until the baby is born! we think it would be such more exciting just to wait & guess :)))) so we are just going to buy all yellow clothing for it & not blue or pink :) well.. some blue is ok i guess lolz, we have a boy now & we are really hoping that we get a girl this time, but i so totally think that keeping it a surprise is soooo much more exciting?!    Good Luck x X x how exciting :) (;|`|vrHeGvy2aa	I am currently waiting to find out if I am pregnant with my 3rd child.  My first 2 are girls and I think I may want this one to be a surprise.

I like the tradition of passing down the father's name, although it smacks  of being too patriarchal.|`|hZqC88dyaa	Brody O'Neil goes together nicely|`|FrkF7PaRaa	I love the names Harlow, Carysn and Ashton! Brody is not one of my favorite names....I love your middle names though! What about Carsyn Harlow or Ashton Harlow?? If I had to pick from your list though, I would pick Brody Carsyn.|`|HurPmgSaaa	Brody Conner.|`|X6as2nOAaa	brody jenner. ha ha um..brody jackson?|`|5VSVNBkTaa	What about Brody (name of father) ?|`|J3TRJPIwaa	Brody Conner looks and sounds the best to me!    Edit: Haha I could never do a junior name - Don Jr. - hah no way! Thank goodness my husband agrees with me! You are right about Brody Daniel not flowing but what about Brody James. Will that go with your last name? If our baby is a boy we are giving him my husbands middle name and our girl will get my middle name to use as her own. Let me know what you think of Brody James!|`|ihfsrPlkaa	brody harlow is cool, brody ashton and brody conner are good too. i dont think the rest roll of the tongue at all.|`|DvwDjGiLaa	My sister is due in the next two weeks and she is naming her son Brody Michael.    I like Brody Conner the best.    Maybe to honor your husband you could name the baby Brody James or give the baby his middle name Brody_______
ldyKSejgaa	The desire to have children is one of the most powerful desires couples and families face. Infertility can often wreak havoc on an otherwise calm and loving relationship. It is important that you understand that multiple reasons and causes may affect your ability to get pregnant. Even among the most fertile couples, the chances of conceiving a baby in the first months of trying are generally 25%. That means that roughly 75% will have to continue trying for some time.<br>  <br>  If you want to start a family and are impatient to do so, you may find yourself asking why you can't get pregnant. There are many reasons that women may experience difficulty getting pregnant when trying to conceive. Some of the more common reasons include the following:<br>  <br>  ?  Maternal age - many women are waiting until they have finished their education and have well-established careers before getting pregnant. Advancing maternal age can decrease the likelihood that you will conceive relatively quickly. For every year you are over the age of thirty your fertility declines steadily.<br>  <br>  ?  Your partner's health and age - Men's fertility also decreases as they age, though not as quickly as women's fertility. Men's fertility generally starts to decline after the age of forty.<br>  <br>  ?  Your lifestyle - Multiple lifestyle factors may affect your ability to conceive. This includes your diet, exercise regimen, level of stress, sleep habits and more. To conceive it is best that you are as healthy as possible. That means limiting alcohol and tobacco consumption, eating well, engaging in regular (but not excessive) exercise and getting plenty of sleep.<br>  <br>  ?  Overly stressed - too much stress can inhibit your chances of conceiving. Whether planning too stringently to have a baby or working too hard on the job, many women find the more stressed they are the more trouble they have conceiving. The same may be true of their partners.<br>  <br>  ?  Type of Clothing - men who wear tight fitting clothing may produce less sperm than men who where looser fitting clothes and underwear. This may affect your ability to conceive. So if your partner prefers briefs, have him switch to boxers and baggy pants for a change. This may be just the boost you need to help promote greater fertility.<br>  <br>  ?  Hormonal Problems - hormonal problems including an over active or under active thyroid, conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome or progesterone deficiencies can all contribute to conception problems. Some women are able to conceive for example but their bodies do not produce enough progesterone to sustain a pregnancy. If you worry that you may have a physical or hormonal problem that is affecting your ability to conceive, you should consult with your doctor about treatment options.<br>  <br>  ?  Low sperm count - some men have a low sperm count, which can make conceiving more difficult. You should have your partner tested to rule out this physical condition. There are even home tests available if your partner is shy about having this test performed.<br>  <br>  ?  Caffeine consumption - if you consume more than one or two cups of coffee each day, you may be reducing your chances of conceiving. Some studies suggest that any amount of caffeine may interfere with the eggs ability to successfully implant into your uterus, hence preventing a full pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Remember, if you are having problems conceiving it is important you consult with your doctor or heath care provider to help determine a proper plan of action for helping you realize your dreams. Most parents will be able to successfully conceive with proper care and with proper attention to any factors that may be inhibiting their chances of successful conception.|`|HMPdnhApaa	It took me 1 month to get pregnant with my daughter. It took me 2 years to get pregnant with this baby. So I would say just be patient and if you are realy worried go to your doctor and have them do his sperm count. Women can also be sterile so it's not necessarily his fault if there is a problem. Just go see your doctor if it takes over a year and you are in a hurry to get pregnant.|`|xytNERzlaa	You could careless?<br>  I would suggest an ovulation calender and you can find one online and enter your info.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Your man is shooting blanks.|`|YyPrmn9jaa	The most likely reason that you are not getting pregnant is that you are not ovulating around the time you have intercourse.<br>  <br>  The average woman has a 28 day menstrual cycle and ovulates on day 14 of this cycle (day 1 being the first day of your period).<br>  <br>  In order to get pregnant you have to have unprotected sex between days 9-14 of your cycle as sperm can live up to 5 days in your reproductive system to fertilize the egg.<br>  <br>  Even if this occurs there is only about a 20-25% chance of conception so it is actually quite difficult to get pregnant!|`|auutSNQzaa	could be anything.. really.. go to the doctor to find out.. <br>  <br>  could be low sperm count<br>  <br>  could be your not ovulating... <br>  <br>  could be alot of things|`|dq9uclgpaa	Are you having sex while your ovulating? If you are have, have you been to a fertility doctor for both of you too see if one of you could be infertile?|`|sxZk6njLaa	You don't care if you get pregnant... strange.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it can take months, even years to conceive. It doesn't necessarily mean either of you are infertile.
GWveqx61aa	well maybe if he had some sperm on his penis, and then his sperm would have to be super sperm, but yes it is possible, sperm can live up to 7 days, and that totals 11, and if you have a normal 7 day period thats 18 days and if you have a normal 28 day cycle than absolutely, there is a chance, because youd ovulate around day 14, good luck|`|ITfBQzg6aa	your kindda weird..|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	ha, not likely.|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people dont want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer.<br>  <br>  to be honest- it sounds like your getting your period- i would wait and see - dont wast your $ untill your at least a week late|`|Ox1vB8xwaa	Slim to none.  You can get pregnant when you're ovulating, which is usually 2 weeks after your period.|`|WIEPISyeaa	Yeah, you could be pregnant.  But it's pretty unlikely.|`|OLyP8rtRaa	no you can't be pregnant.|`|YN0Bs8pRaa	Next to none
drI1vsJdaa	Let your mom make it. Or just do something else.|`|ZX2so3twaa	then have your mom make it.|`|uM7U7Bkvaa	Don't understand this? And isn't making it yourself cheating?<br>  <br>  LOL

Im naming them Camile Lee and Jessa Cylee.
Wjdpm4xNaa	Yes I just flew last weekend w/my 7 month old.  I was a bit nervous about how he would react but he was such a good boy.  he was  looking out the window and then fell asleep halfway through the flight and woke up when it ended.  I would say go for it.  Make sure you do have bottles(or not if your breastfeeding) if your little one does get cranky that should calm them down...and bring a toy for the baby to play with.  good luck!|`|AA12074269	Make sure you book a bulk head seat and say its for the baby - double check at check-in.<br>  <br>  On one of my flights from Italy-KL, a women with a baby didnt, she thought it was automatic and the people at the bulkhead wouldn't swap seats (as it would have meant the family was broken up) with her so she had to hold the baby for the entire flight.|`|2ucsbBGjaa	I flew with my son when he was 6 months.  He did fine, but the stewardesses said they were impressed they said usually babies do terrible on planes.  Always have a bottle prepared, the sucking will help the ears not pop.  It seems like a long flight, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
aJjV5b95aa	If you do not feel that you are ready like you said there is plenty of time. You also might be scared of having another miscarriage. Talk to you significat other about how he feels and see if that helps you. I am a firm believer in everything happens for a reason.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I am so sorry for your loss. I to had a miscarriage with my secon child but at 11 weeks. I started trying right away (against my docs advice) and although I was sure I wanted another child (my daughter was 5) I was so scared my entire pregnancy that something would go wrong. I didn't give myself time to heal for my loss (I miscarried in the begining of June and was pregnant in August) If you don't feel like your ready, don't feel guilty about waiting.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I'm very sorry for your loss :( There is nothing wrong with waiting to try again. Make sure this is something you really really want. You probably have lots of time to try again. Enjoy your son right now. Best of luck
7rJrOb7eaa	Here's the lowdown   http://www.atcmag.com/v8n2/article8.asp    Free ultrasounds   http://www.care-net.org/  http://www.choosehope.org/free-limited-u...    Planned Parenthood does NOT offer free ultrasounds, only free testing.   Contact pro-life organizations, the try to offer free ultrasounds because this helps make a decision to keep the baby when the mom actually sees the baby on screen|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	yes. planned parenthood will do it confidentially and for free|`|o7E59VYZaa	You have to have insurance for an ultrasound because it would cost you about 500 dollars without. when do you turn 18? maybe wait until then?? I think you can get an untrasound even if your still 17. good luck hun:)|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	it depends on if you are on your parents insurance or not, if you are, you may need a parent to come with you. You can always go to a clinic like planned parenthood and such. look up the number and ask them, that would be your best bet.|`|FSY30gbvaa	if you are ALMOST 18, then no. Being that you are still a minor, they need to sign for the insurance to be billed. Dr's are massively expensive if you go in as self pay.     If you dont have insurance, call your county health department, they will get you connected to medicaid.    As for your parents, hun there is no "right" time.  You dont say how far you are, but you need thier support at this time.
0upnZ6hSaa	Well--it's DEF not like Bella!!  LOL!!  It's different for everyone.  I'm sure scary for some.  But if you're old enough, married to someone you love and ready for it---it's a fabulous time in your life.  But you're 14 hun---worry about the mall and shopping and the NEW MOON movie coming out next year!!  :)|`|PfLg9B6aaa	It has ts ups and downs. Im stuck in bed right now trying not to throw up.  I love those books!!!!  Thank you.|`|AA11661793	It's a great thing when you are ready for it. Wait a while say 10ish years?|`|em8A42Bqaa	no, its not cute.  when you have to go to work even when you are sick and have fever and throwing up.  It's awful!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	The pregnancy part isn't as glamourous as it looks in the movies.  I'm only 16 weeks along and I have allll the pregnancy symptoms.<br>  <br>  I'm sure when the baby arrives it will be pure bliss and I will forget about the crazy symptoms!<br>  <br>  I'm so glad that you plan on being responsible and NOT having babies until you are alot older!  :)
n3IoftMFaa	Yes! My God, it is exhausting, isn't it? You feel bad and embarrassed and angry and hopeless and defensive...so many negative feelings.   You may need to go heavy on both ends of the spectrum:  Speak with his teacher, then next time he is bad and doesn't respond to punishment, have her call you. You come immediately and pick him up. No ifs ands or butts - immediate removal. He goes home, no computer, favorite toys, tv. Let him know you mean business.  Right now, nothing is really happening to him that he doesn't like or can't tolerate. You've got to find his currency and if he is anything like my son, and he does sound a lot like him, he wants to be where the action is.  Then on the other side. Love him up! Make sure you have a special time for just you and him - NO BABY. You guys go to get ice cream or go to a movie or to the park. Hug him, tell him how proud you are of him - how much you love him.  He'll get it :  he is a VERY bright boy who is jealous and has figured out how to run you and the teacher! But he is a good boy too and just needs some tough love.|`|8khZ0fJZaa	My 5 year old brother is the same and worse. But he has ADD. I suggest giving him harder discipline. If my little brother went to school and played during lunch time, I will take away his snack after dinner. (which is normally something really good like ice-cream, cookies or a banana split.) I discipline him since I am with him from 5:00 pm- about 9 or 10 p.m. Take out hitting him all together if you find it possible. Explain to him that hitting is bad in simple terms. Tell him all the good things that could happen if he does good in school. That works on my brother. Oh, and kids really hate time out. He cries and I only put him there for about 5 or 6 minutes. Make sure there is nothing within arms reach of him. Good luck.|`|46CmHlFlaa	I'm curious what's "ok at home but not at school". Hitting peoples bottoms" should be unacceptable at home as well. Your son needs to have guidelines that are consistent from home to school. He needs to know that disobeying those rules means consequences at home or at school. Common courtesy and politeness is a good way to start. Rudeness, talking back to any adult,  or hitting is never acceptable behavior from a child, or from an adult for that matter. Your mother needs to understand that she is undermining you and not helping her grandson. It's not unusual for Grandmas to be more lenient, but she should still expect respectful behavior.    Continue to work with your son's teacher, letting her know that you support her efforts.
vxoWXVLKaa	I am having the same issue with my daughter, but she is younger and so her lack of hearing properly is affecting her ability to pronounce words properly.  I took her to her pediatrician and they did a test with this little machine that checks how the ear drum moves in response to sound and found that she has a build-up of fluid behind her ear drum that is putting pressure and affecting her hearing.<br>  <br>  I am taking her this coming Monday for an appointment with an ENT specialist to do more extensive testing.  It is worth looking into though because I was told that if the pressure remains, the eardrum can burst and if the tear does not heal properly, it can permanently affect their hearing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Does he have anything stuck in his ear? You never know with kids, it could be lodged in there, and you'd never know. Even simple things such as a Q Tip puff can get in there and mess with hearing. I would definetley take him to a doc to see what's wrong though, you never know. Especially if its something that happened just recently and is noticeable in his behavior.|`|kkipAB1daa	take him to the doctor he might have ear wax built up, all they will do is irrigate it, it's not painful and also have them check his hearing. all the hearing test is is putting on headphones and telling them which side he hears a sound from.|`|G3sSeUataa	Okay this is so totally weird.  My son is having this exact same problem.  It's kinda creepy how everything you wrote down my son is doing!  I'm just waiting to see what everyone else says.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	have you had you doctor look in int . he may have ear wax build up .|`|qayCggxMaa	Even if he hasn't seemed sick prior to this, it could be an ear infection or just a buildup of fluid in the ears.  It could also be swimmer's ear, or as someone else mentioned maybe he's put something in his ear, or even hurt his eardrum by poking stuff in his ear.  The answer to any and all of this is, yes, take him to the doctor (your GP is fine) and get it checked out.
mY19PPlIaa	If you have regular periods and have not been stressed out at all and not making yourself think your pregnant. Then I say test, and it might be positive and if its negative you should call the gyno. Can you please let us know what the test said?|`|H74F8jxuaa	Take a test in the morning.  It sounds like you're pregnant!|`|cGDiQXMZaa	id would say go for it take a test  being a week late now that's a good Sign xxx good luck hun|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Hunni u may need to see an OBGYN if your passing clots. Hang in there! I would call them soon. TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	If it's a week, your HCG levels should be high enough to take a test, so I would suggest you take one, and make sure it's first thing in the morning.  Good Luck to you.  My period was late and I got super excited but ended up I wasn't, but I was only 3 days late.  With a week late your chances are a lot higher.  Baby Dust!!!
9OsjdsrZaa	If there is a second line...no matter how faint. You are pregnant.  My second line was so light I could barely see it, but it was there.    HOWEVER, you need to do another test and let it sit out the right time...nice and flat so that you can be sure on this one. Of course the only true test, is to have a blood test done by your OB.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i would re test in the morning and leave it sitting for the 3 mins no longer and then check|`|29575138fce7f69706c4b3a917c6fef5aa	You have to be careful. You can't put the test in the stream for too long or for too short of a time. I've found that you get all ready, have the stick ready and then start your stream. Count to four and remove and lay flat. FLAT is very important and just do not touch it or look until the box says to. Usually between 2 and five minutes.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	how long did you leave it?? If it was past 10 minutes the test is invalid. I would retest again in the am!!! GOOD LUCK HUN! tons of baby dust!!!|`|Faw2iBtfaa	There is a very good chance what you saw was an evaporation line.  A test is not considered accurate after 10 minutes.  I would wait and take a test with first morning urine and make sure to wait until at least 5 minutes or so has gone by without throwing that test away...good luck!|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I had that happen to me and I was pregnant. Take one more in the morning and this time let it stand for the 3 minutes to be sure. I think you are though:)|`|NMzlbWt8aa	You should take another test in a week, and wait for first morning urine.  Wait the whole amount of time before throwing the test away.  What you saw may have been an evap line, depending on how long after you took the test that you looked again.  Take another test just to be sure tho. Good luck|`|NmKu7VKTaa	If the box says that if you see two lines then that is a yes, then I would say that you are b/c if you look at the directions, it shows diagrams of the different lines you could possibly see that will give a positive. If you still aren't sure, just retest or go to the doctor.         ks|`|OZnsSElRaa	You are pregnant, a line is a line.  Congrats!|`|Lgo6UX12aa	I would definitely take another test. Most experience I have had with pregnancy tests is that they are pretty accurate right after you take them. When I found out I was pregnant the second line was faint but it was there and it showed up shortly after the first line. I personally use First Response. I would definitely take another one just to make sure!|`|AA10038269	Your pregnant. Congrats.When I found out that i was pregnant and i took the test it was the same way. But if you want to double check then you can take another one|`|3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	It did happen to me and I was pregnant. But it had been shorter than a 10 min. span.  If you waited more than 10 minutes I would retest tomorrow morning.  It sounds like you could be, but be sure next time to let the test sit the right amount of time. In early pregnancy the time limit is important.
8Rn2pX4jaa	First... CALL YOUR DOCTOR.  It is probably nothing, your uterus expanding or your body adjusting to pregnancy, but at 31 weeks you don't want to take any chances.  If it is labor, your pains will come in consistent waves and will intensify.  But that doesn't mean that something else is not going on.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|qERAKF13aa	id say its braxton hicks, ive been having them too.|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	Call your doctor, but it sounds like contractions to me!
4RjM5lElaa	If money is tight for you - even if it isn't - I highly recommend Target.  Their line of clothes is terrific: good colors, wide range of sizes, VERY good prices, cute onesies...it's definitely worth the look|`|f949a6440379e23438eb10c50bdfb4abaa	I have seen some cute things at Gymboree. You might also see if there is a local baby boutique that carries specialized items (they will be more expensive, but some are just too cute!)...good luck!
TpdvK4Wxaa	No.  I shipped in the USAF beat OTC pregancy tests and 3 blood tests.  You take one at MEPS.  Another in 4 days while inprocessing.  I took another because I started to have medical problems and was put in the hospital 2 weeks after the second.  That one still came up negative.  But I definitely was pregnant because there is no physical way that I could've gotten pregnant after that.  And I mean no way as in it physically never occurred.  It's pretty uncommon, but from time to time happens.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	blood tests are the most accurate|`|JsshzKM9aa	Blood tests are never inaccurate.
AA11542929	um no .. u need to tell her u are hiv positive and that is ur baby!! be a man and man up to ur responsibilities. if u were her how would u feel if she gave u a  hiv and got u pregnant.. put ur feet in her shoes..|`|afAbSq5gaa	No should tell her that you have HIV f you havent already, the sooner they can test the baby to see if it has it too the better.<br>  No matter what if the baby is born you have to pay child support so.....|`|BlgZmV6uaa	Yeah you sound like your a worthless turd anyways.Nobody deserves you.There is no sense in you sticking around to make the childs life crappy as well.|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	hahahahaha.<br>  <br>  Nice one, troll.|`|AA11661793	be a man take resposibility for your actions.|`|tzPEckiZaa	Made up drama. <br>  <br>  Troll|`|PfLg9B6aaa	wow|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	are you telling the truth if you are you need to let your partner know so she can get herself checked and the child could have it god you should have been way more careful if you have such a life threatening condition!!!!|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	Gosh!<br>  I take it your girlf knows u r HIV and that she is also HIV.<br>  There is a chance the baby will not be infected, you have to stand up to your responsibility's and support her and your baby...!|`|Od73sfkxaa	Do these three things:<br>  <br>  1.) Tell her you have HIV<br>  <br>  2.) Do not leave -- she needs your support.<br>  <br>  3.) Once she knows she has HIV make sure she tells her doctor. I am pretty sure there is a way to prevent the baby from having it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	uhm no you should man up and take responsibility.|`|KGRikkJeaa	NO! that would be irresponsible...theres a chance the child wont have it|`|dbafItLvaa	go troll somewhere else
05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	If she is, you can <br>  <br>  1) Marry her and try to get a job<br>  <br>  2) Try to convince her to put the child up for adoption<br>  <br>  3) Try to convince her to have an abortion.<br>  <br>  4) Tell her you'll be there for her, let her live with her parents and let them support her, see the kid once a day for the first six months, then gradually drift out of their lives on a trail of broken promises and unpaid child support.<br>  <br>  (2) is the best for the child, worst for the parents. <br>  (4) is the most common. <br>  <br>  There aren't any others. Not all of life's decisions are as simple as "Chocolate, vanilla or strawberry?"<br>  <br>  The word you wrote that is splotted out looks like "come" with a "u" and no "e". The medical term is "ejaculate", and you don't need to. Sperm are sneaky little devils.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	That would make her 7 weeks pregnant. The signs would show up. If you guys had sex on the 8th symptoms would not show up yet. Going by her last lmp she got pregnant before you were together.|`|27f16a1a2275258802b78014bc189e59aa	that's only two and a half weeks ago, if she got pregnant on the 8th, i doubt that her "symptoms" are relavant, however, if she hasn't had a period since january 1st, she probably got pregnant sometime in january and her symptoms would be relavant. keep in mind, she only has less than three months to decide if she's getting an abortion or not. go to the doctor to find out. or at the very least take a home pregnancy test.|`|39547d83a5156f9293d7f12e96038e86aa	should have thought about that before you had unprotected sex.  hopefully your lesson has been learned|`|8zODA3dIaa	looks to me like she was preg. before feb 8th
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	First, you should contact your doctor.  Sometimes, these things happen-with swelling and such, it can be difficult to get it sewn up "properly"-I am sure he did his best.  Most doctor's will probably not want to touch the issue (no pun intended) because of liability issues.<br>  <br>  Medicaid covers your care afterbirth for up to either 6 or 8 weeks, so you should be fine as far as that goes.  Just give them a call asap!<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new little one, BTW.|`|OIS808Qmaa	Go to the emergency room if you have to, Medicaid should cover that.  Please get it taken care ASAP, you could get an infection or end up healing in a way that will be uncomfortable to you permanently.|`|xyI7PRuhaa	you need to see a dr asap.  Like the other poster said, another dr is probably do going to want to get involved.<br>  <br>  Also, it might not be his repair work.  If your swelling was not equal, then it probably pulled the stitches.  Sometimes problems develop/tissue doesn't heal as expected and it has nothing to do with the skill of the dr/midwife who did the repair. If you have an open wound, it can get infected and trust me, you don't want that.
ZNhP3mpUaa	Just so you know, an episiotomy is not a widely used practice any more. MOST clinicians allow you to tear. I would discuss this with your doctor as part of your child birthing plan. Chances are they will tell you something like 'we wouldn't do that anyway'... you havae to be delivering vaginally and the baby has to be mighty large for a dr to do one anymore... the percentages anymore are very low... i read that in what to expect...|`|b3CwObBdaa	i don't really understand - episiotomy occurs only during vaginal birth....<br>  <br>  anyhow.  i asked my doc and he said that the hospital he is at has a 7% episiotomy rate and that they only do it when the baby is in distress.|`|9P26sacKaa	It is very rare for a woman to actually *need* an episiotomy.  This procedure makes you more likely to have a very bad tear and actually does not heal as well as a natural tear.  A rate higher than 10% is definitely higher than necessary and even that rate is probably too high.  Your vagina is designed to stretch and tear if too much pressure is put on it too fast.<br>  <br>  The only time an episiotomy would really be helpful is if mere seconds matter to the health of the baby.  If baby is doing fine, there's usually no reason to speed delivery by the mere seconds this procedure allows.  As mentioned, despite common belief, your body usually heals quicker and better after a natural tear than after an episiotomy.<br>  <br>  There are also things you can do to avoid a tear, such as perineal massage prior to labor, warm compresses during pushing, pushing when you feel the urge instead of to a count of 10, stop pushing when you feel a burning sensation as the baby crowns, and listen to your provider when you are pushing because he/she will usually tell you to ease up or stop pushing at one point and that means you're crowning and more likely to tear if you push right at that moment.  <br>  <br>  Your chances of getting an episiotomy depend entirely on your care provider.  The question to ask is, "how often do you do episiotomies?"  The actual rate for YOU is completely dependent on who is down there when baby is coming out.  Midwives have lower rates than doctors and rates vary widely between practitioners in general.  Some doctors (and midwives) cut almost every woman that spreads her legs for a birth, while others leave well enough alone almost every time.<br>  <br>  The best rates I've heard are 2-3%, but I'd be willing to bet that most doctors have rates higher than this.  As I said above though, it's been said in medical literature than anything over 10% is probably too much.|`|BzvstX7uaa	I don't know percentages but in MY CASE, I had an 8lb 3oz baby boy in 2005, didn't get an episiotomy, nor did I tear at all.<br>  <br>  And I hope that will be the case with my second child. I had quick healing and felt great.<br>  <br>  But everybody is different. So I have no clue.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	40% according to pregnancyweekly.com but when I had my son in April I was told that most doctors don't do them anymore, they have found that you heal faster when you tear naturally. I can tell you if your worried about the pain at that point you won't feel it anyway!lol|`|Jteqao3zaa	i'm a little confused, if its not a vag birth, you wouldn't need an episiotomy|`|ZXeUJ4RRaa	i had an episiotomy with my first daughter she was 9lbs.13oz. i didn't have one with my second daughter she was 8lbs.11oz.
ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people dont want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer.|`|0KGriIC7aa	i would get a test just to be safe. but your are probally running late due to the hormone changes from missing your pills.|`|X0f444TOaa	Get a test, even if it's negative it will calm your nerves.
AA10371609	Most women can have sex all the way up until they are ready to give birth.  However, some women have problems with their cervix and are banned from the bedroom love until after the baby's born and they heal.  Usually, the doctor will assess any bleeding problems and determine if its safe to have sex.    My doctor told me that as long as I'm comfortable doing it, I'll be fine.  But at the first sign of blood, stop.  Every woman is different.|`|My93XR2Maa	You can have sex as long you wont to im thats wat my dr. told me|`|99q5I5tQaa	the entire time.

TJ04fAgNaa	When we had our 1st, my husband and I were both 21.  He was going to school full time and also working nights when he would get out of class.  His job was an hour away, so he had a commute both ways.  Things were EXTREMELY tough on the home front.  My son was colicy and I had no help.  I got practically no sleep for his first 3 months.  I was pumping for 45 min after every feeding so that I would have enough for half of the next bottle. (I was uneducated about pumping at the time).  It would take my son 30-45 minutes to eat 2 oz and he would eat every 2 hours like clockwork, so I was literally getting almost no sleep.  I had asked my husband for SOME kind of help.  Let me take a bath for 20 min, SOMETHING, but he was too tired and also really didn't know what to do with a baby.  <br>  <br>  Finally after 3 months of this I grabbed him by his shirt collar and got in his face.  I told him if he wouldn't give me a break every now and then that I was out the door.  He wasn't helping me and I was doing all of this myself anyway! <br>  <br>  I don't suggest you take that rout of getting his attention.  While he did suck it up and help a little more, it did alienate him and hurt his feelings.  He was so busy trying to better the lives of his family and I wasn't seeing it from that perspective.  My suggestion is that you sit him down and talk with him.  Explain that you do understand that he is working so hard and that you appreciate all he does.  Let him know that you are really desperatly trying to handle everything so that he can have some time to himself when he gets home, but that you are struggling to keep it together.  Ask him if he will just give you 30 minutes a night so that you can just sit back and relax, take a hot bath, read a book.  I bet if you approach it from that perspective that he will be much more open to helping you.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and congrats on the new addition!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I agree it is both our job not just the woman's, that's a very old school of thought that my bf's grandma tryed to pull on me when i complained of how he rarely if ever helps with the baby.<br>  anyways, for me it hasnt gotten better. i am even looking into moving out seriously it's that bad. if i ask him for one favor like get me the bathtub etc he gets all defensive. even on his days off, he hardly helps. i too do all housework laundry etc however with errands we go half in half. I think it's even more unfair he expects you to do errands when it is INCREDIBLY hard taking the baby just to places like the store bc of all the carseat stuff etc. You could try talking to him, in a calm rational manner, but I have tried doing this it didnt work for me. Hopefully it will for you. Some men are just @ssholes. it's no excuse but sometimes they don't change, and hopefully your guy isn't one of those that refuses to change.|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	just talk with him. alone. be sure to not point fingers, accuse or be rude because then he will just feel attacked & be defensive. "ask" him fo rthe help & tell him you "need" him. make him feel wanted & needed. you can also make it about "daddy time". yah know what i mean? being a mom & house wife is hard work & never-ever-ending. i think a lot of husbands feel that ebcaus ethey actually "go" to work, they have the right to rest when they walk in & there we are still cooking, cleaning & all baby business. <br>  tell him that he needs to get up earlier & help feed....try to make it a good thing & a special thing...i duuno, its hard to talk to husbands.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	maybe u should arrange a girls day out on one of his days off so u can go out and leave daddy and son at home u may find once he had to do all the baby stuff  he may find he likes it  and will start  doing more it will be a good chance for him to bond and stuff|`|yea2hci5aa	I know you respect that your husband works 12 hour shifts out of the home but you work 24 hour shifts with you son!  You need to explain to him that you're not asking him cook, clean, etc. You're just asking him to take the time to bond with his own son.  <br>  Explain to him that you try your hardest to get everything done through out the day.  I mean even the simplest chore like loading the dishwasher suddenly because 100% harder to do with a little one in your arms.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.  Hopefully after you explain everything to your husband and how you feel he'll finally get it.<br>  <br>  Men, what can you do?
NbJbZXtGaa	I don't think you are pg. It is so weird that you ask this though, because my January period was four days early, and lighter and shorter than normal too, and I am definitely not pregnant, so I did some research. A woman's cycle can vary at any point for reason that may be unknown. It is pretty common for women with regular cycles to occasionally experience this type of "blip". Obviously, tests to be sure, but if you feel the bleeding was a little too heavy to be IB, then it probably was AF.|`|HZvo9YFHaa	i didnt have morning sickness til i was 6m along, and i had a period til i was 7m. but everyone is different. so test and hope for the best!
Tr7kIQPkaa	I used the summer video monitor with my daughter and loved it!! With my son I used the AngelCare Monitor. It detects movement. If there is no movement in 15 seconds an alarm goes off.

I also like Charlotte, and it's not super common, and it's sort of old fashioned.   Aza is an African name I think, and it means "Comfort". I thought it sounded pretty :)    And I also like  Molly, which is pretty common, i guess.   Ardelia means "Great", and it's super unique.   Aurora is pretty, and I have never known anyone by that name.   Thalia reminds me of a flower, and it has a "breezy feel" to it (well, at least to me)  Avery is a beautiful name, but it means "Ruler of the elves" so I don't know if you want your kid to be an elf queen...  Ella is very pretty, and simple. I don't know how common, though...  Alionora is an Irish name and I think that it sounds very regal.   Ryley is a somewhat common name, but not for girls.   Teagan is also Irish, and not very common.   Fiona is a beautiful name that i have always loved, and it means "Fair" or "Pale" and is of Gaelic origin.   Arianna is Italian and it means "Very holy".   Abigail is common, I have to admit, but it is also very beautiful sounding.   Madeline is not really super common. It's French.   Raine is a fantastic name that I adore and it's also French and means "Queen".   Aneko is a Japanese name and it's pretty and unique.  Evelyn is Celtic and it is not common, it sounds kind of old fashion, and it means "light".   Kiara is a fabulous Irish name.  Burgan is cute, and unique.  Dalia is pretty, and always reminds me of flowers.   I just had a baby cousin named Acacia, which is Spanish, and it means "Honorable"  Nova is a very pretty name, and it reminds me of stars, it's Native American, and means "Chases butterflies"  Hope is very pretty and not very common.  Tallulah is Native American also and it means "Running water", like a river or something, I guess.   Bailey is a boy OR girl name, and it sounds very pretty, although it reminds me of alcohol.   Coraline is very pretty, and they are coming out with a movie with that title, although I  have always thought it sounded pretty.   Skylar is Dutch, and it also is very cute.  Ziva is vey pretty and definitely not common.   I have also always LOVED the name Delilah, although it is borderline common I guess.   Elina, or Elena is a pretty Italian name.   Avani is beautiful.  Milly is not common, and I love the sound of it.  Cadence is a beautiful name, and not common at all.  Estelle is pretty and unique.

BxrU8kUJaa	It's not something where you "use" it.  You just keep having sex and when the cervix is at a state when it's receptive to it, it might help soften it.|`|gUdlaaGwaa	I have never heard of this. I don't think it's possible. Your cervix obviously softened because you went into labour early. When the cervix doesn't soften you have to be induced by your gynaecologist.|`|iMULlxdgaa	lol...I guess whenever your in the mood!  You won't go into labor unless your body is about to go anyway,  the semen thing only increases the chance of progressing labor, it won't bring on labor by itself.  But at around 37-40 weeks you could always "get busy" for the fun of it and see if it works!  You cna get busy now too...it'll make the time go faster.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	People can have sex throughout pregnancy, and the cervix will not respond to the semen unless it's ready to. You can't force anything to happen.

Be sure to use spell check when trying to apply for a job.     Best idea, write down your qualities (you are only 14 but believe me you have qualities that make you a good babysitter) and post in your local high school Job Board, it always worked at my school. If someone wants to hire you, meet publicly somewhere (preferrably with mom or dad) to interview.

And then after that it takes another little while until anything would be visible on an ultrasound.  Most OB's don't do Ultrasounds until 6 weeks along.|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey  No it would be way too early for them to see anything on an ultrasound just yet.

DuLhv7Ajaa	I understand how you feel. My husband and I got pregnant 2 weeks after getting married, it wasn't planned. Although we weren't ready yet, we both got excited and very attached to the baby. At 11 weeks I miscarried and it was devastating. I wanted to get pregnant right away, to fill the loss that I was feeling. But I pushed passed that emotion (it wasn't easy) and waited for 2 years, until we were truly ready to start our family.   My advice is to grieve your loss, but wait until you are really ready to start your family. Trust me your life will change completely and you want to be prepared for that.|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	I am so sorry for your loss.  Yes, you will be grieving for your baby even if you weren't that far along. . . you already loved the idea of your baby, you already had dreams for your baby. . . and it is so very hard to have to let those dreams go.      I miscarried last month, and wanted to try again right away, even though my doctor said to wait one cycle.  My husband and I did have unprotected sex, but my AF showed up right on time yesterday, so I am not pregnant again, and I am rather upset about it, too.       You should probably wait at least a cycle or two (but definitely talk to your doctor - I am not one!)     However, perhaps it is a good idea to try to wait until you are done with school - your can get all of your classwork done and enjoy more time alone with your husband in that space of two years.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	As long as you are not trying to get pregnant to replace what you lost it is entirely healthy to try again.   Your parents cannot tell you and your own husband when is right for you to have a family!   As a mom and a student though, it's tough to do both, but it's not impossible!  Sorry for your lose and I hope you make the right decision for you and not your parents!|`|umI2VZqVaa	only you can be the judge of that. If you do decide to try again, have 2 or 3 normal periods first, or how many your doc thinks. If you are financially ready and emotionally ready I would consider it, but keep in mind you have the rest of your lives in front of you, and im sure your parents have your best interests at heart!!!!|`|WIYWJwqcaa	I had a miscarriage almost a year ago. It wasn't planned but also wasn't prevented. My husband and I were both 19 at the time and he's in college and doesn't graduate until the end of this summer. Yes, it's normal to feel the way you are feeling. You and your husband just need to sit down and decide what's best for the two of you. I was depressed for months afterwards but my husband and I leaned on each other for support and decided that if we get pregnant again we get pregnant.... if not then it will happen when the time is right for us.   As far as being able to try again physically, my doc told us to wait until after I have a normal period.   Sorry for your loss and best of luck to you guys!!! Hope this helped!!|`|F8iYNurEaa	I miscarriaged last week and thought that, due to grief and fear, I couldn't possibly even think about ttc again anytime soon. However, here I am a week later counting down the days until I can start trying again. There is nothing wrong with wanting to start again after a miscarriage. If this is what you both want to do then go for it.
3EhoJ42zaa	My son had the same exact problem from 6 months till 10 months.  he would be fine up until it was time for him to try to go to the bathroom.  HE would scream as if someone were beating him.  I kept calling the doctors office and the nurses kept saying "it's constipation" and kept telling me to give him warm apple juice.  It would work for a day or two then it would go back to where he would struggle every time he would go to the bathroom.  he had his 9 month check up and it was with another pediatrician since our regular one was out of town.  I told her about this consitpation problem and she kept telling me to add more fiber to his diet and probiotics (yogurt and such) and I told her that is not enough.  Well she told me to try it.  At 10 months I had enough.  I called and I made an appointment to see my sons regular doctor when he got back from his vacation.  The nurses fought with me telling me it was no reason to make an appointment and they again told me to add more fiber and all that crap again.  I finally got my appointment and at that appointment the doctor FINALLY prescribed him something.  It is some liquid called Enulose I believe.  You start off giving a small dose every day until he starts to become regular then once he becomes regular you start lessening it by every other day then every two days and such.  After two weeks of my son using that stuff he is as regular as can be.  So I would strongly suggest seeing your doctor again, or getting a second opinion.  Maybe ask about Enulose|`|v6Ehreizaa	I would go back to the doctor.  If miralax isn't working it could be a bigger problem.|`|AA11625299	ok seriously you need to talk to your doctor or a nurse, dont take advice about this from ppl off the net, the doctor can maybe give you something else to try|`|ZZhEmJNmaa	My daughter's Dr. told me to use light Karo syrup. Mix a tablespoon in to a bottle or cup of water. The sugar works by drawing additional fluid into babys bowel to soften the stools. The extra water helps loosen things up too. Try giving this to him a few times a day for a day or two. That should do the trick.    Hope this helps! Good Luck! If nothing else, call the pediatrician again! They are always the best resource!!!|`|kUm4fIbIaa	When I was switching my son from formula to milk he had the same problem.  We try everything prune juice, suppositories, apple juice, apple sauce.  We had to take him to the ER one day after over a week of not going because he pushed so hard he threw up and the one doctor had to use her finger and get it all out. Then they took x-rays and he was backed up. Well what she could get out with her finger was rock hard so you need to talk to he doctor and get it out because after he can't get it out for so long it keeps toxins in his body.You need to mean and demand them to do something because the little guy is probably miserable.  GOOD LUCK!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	The suppositories are the safest thing you can give him if he needs help regularly - because they're not strong stimulant-irritants, and they don't affect the whole bowel.  (And they're almost guaranteed to make him do a smelly in a few minutes!)
5RoYyprkaa	Well, how long have you been taking the pills? If you've only been taking them for a two or three months, it's not uncommon to miss a period. If you've been on them a while, then you could need a different dose or pill, or you could be pregnant. When you stop your pills, you'll have a withdrawal bleed that is NOT your period, and it takes most people at least 3 months to have a real period. Stopping your pills with a week left will only mess it up more. If you're going to stop taking them, then stop the week your're supposed to be on your period, and just don't start the pack again, and take a pregnancy test.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Let me get this straight. I'm gathering that you are on birth control pill, and somehow think you are pregnant. So you are thinking you could find out faster if u can start ur period faster --or see if it comes sooner by quitting your pills.     If that is what you mean by your question i think that answer is that you are not pregnant if you have been using the birthcontrol pill right.  Secondly you do not even get a real period because you are not ovulating when you use the pill, so you could not get pregnant.     If you stop ur pills a week early you will have breakthru bleeding, spotting probably then start your period shortly after.|`|s56Hv7BSaa	correct|`|3c72c12f61775453dad9ce1324c61851aa	youd be better off to go to the doc of take a good pregnancy test... some women still have their periods when they are pregnant ...
P1VoMS36aa	its very unlikely you will go into labour during sex!  alot of sex could help to soften your cervix- i mean a lot!  and if you do go into labour anytime soon your baby should b fine because you term at 37wks!  maybe you could persuade your hubby by telling him this is one of the last times in the next few months he will be getting any, once your baby is here you will not b interested for a while- he should enjoy you!!  hope thats helped.  good luck!!   xxxx|`|hLohtlPEaa	My first husband was the same way. It's just fear. Ask your doctor. Masturbation is always an option.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You haven't had sex since you found out you were pregnant?  Perhaps you should have had your doctor explain to him that sex is not off limits.  You could have saved both of you a lot of stress.    Sex during pregnancy will NOT induce labour or cause your water to break. (Unless you were going to go into labour anyway..)  Sex during pregnancy is perfectly harmless (and enjoyable!)|`|8oAlBL91aa	Well it is possible to go into labor they say ways to start labor and sex is most effective. Now about the water breaking I highly doubt it the baby is to far up and he's giving himself to much credit no way he's big enough to "poke" the baby. lol.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Have him call and ask your ob. It may help put you into labor but at 37 weeks it is safe now to go into labor. They are extremely cushioned in there and unless he's HUGE down there it won't do any damage to the baby. And I'm talking walrus huge.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	well it can bring labour on but will unlikely break your water.  Tell him just to take it easy and all should be ok...|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well first of all, yes it's possible for ur water break during sex, or sex causing water break afterwards, which is not a bad thing, ur water won't break unless it's supposed to, so if u're supposed to go into labor right now, whether u have sex or not, it'll happen, the sex might just speed up the process by a day or 2. and u have to explain to him that u have ur needs, some women need to have sex, it's like a craving, it's perfectly healthy and doesn't harm the baby at all, u can take him to ur OB/GYN and have ur doctor talk to him to reassure that it's safe.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	It could start your labor, but you're probably ready for that and the baby's about ripe!  I don't think it could break your water.  Take him with you to your next doctor's appointment and ask the doctor.  (It's more convincing coming directly from the doctor.)|`|WPI0Z47saa	Most guys seem to have issues especially as you get further along. It is safe all the way up to when you are dialating. Some doctors will tell you that sex at the end can help speed up the process of going into labor so he isn't entirely wrong. Have him speak to you ob/gyn and they will tell him that it is fine.|`|sqaey2Siaa	I think some men just have something in the back of their minds telling them its either "wrong or harming to the baby" to have intercourse during late pregnancy. My husband was like this towards the end of our last pregnancy. I'm hoping since we've been there and done that and the doctors and everyone told him its completely safe he will be willing with this pregnancy. Tell him to ask the doctor if he must next time you go! Mama needs some loving too, after all that 6 week gap after baby is going to seem like eternity!|`|7fb7e659a2d89fef1b835dc202b88053aa	Have him speak w/ your ob. unless told otherwise, it is safe to have sex your entire pregnancy.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	alma...you know NOTHING      anyway..take him to the doctor with you so the doctor can explain to him its fine!!    how can you go without it that long? i would have slapped him lol    explain to him its ok to have sex and/or try looking up articles online and make him read them.    good luck..|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Tell him that it's fine and that you really want it.  Also, even if you were to go into labor your baby should be fine because you are far enough along.  Try getting him all worked up with oral first, and then turn the lights out so maybe he will forget that you are pregnant for a few minutes.      I have the opposite problem.  I am always nauseous and usually have a headache and my husband wants it everyday regardless of how I am feeling.  It usually makes me feel a bit better afterward, though.|`|AA10371609	It is possible to go into labor at your stage. However, fairly unlikely.  He's just concerned that something may go wrong, and that's normal.    As for your other problem, it may be time to "take things into your own hands" so to speak.|`|3c72c12f61775453dad9ce1324c61851aa	you arnt suppose to have sex that late in your pregnancy.... it culd cause ur water to break and u could go into early labur..... just deal with it....|`|aa1o6Rs0aa	It won't hurt the baby and by 37 weeks if you go into labor big deal! It isnt' even considered premature at 37 weeks. Tell him to get over it and do you!|`|koTI0lsMaa	Just have oral sex, it might calm both your nerves|`|My93XR2Maa	no it wont SEX make your hole bigger so that the baby come down easier. my dr. told me to have a lot of SEX|`|c6eee8ca32c8596d205d0a16a9898eb0aa	True It Can Put You I Labor ...

Make shure you drink plenty of fluids and get lots of rest..if you can.|`|B2dQop3oaa	There could be something wrong with your digestion. We here, at Yahoo!

sQiX4QTnaa	She may just have a very high metabolism.  My 7 year old son is the same way.  If it really concerns you ask her doctor...that would always be your best bet.  She may also be getting ready to go through a growth spurt..there are a lot of normal reasons for a child to go through a period of eating a lot.  Just make sure she is getting healthy food and not just empty calories.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well you could either be nurturing obesity and very bad eating habits by giving in and giving her MORE food; or - she could be eating less than proper foods that DO satisfy her hunger  if she is eating alot of empty calories she WILL feel hungry sooner; or - she needs to eat LESS but more often as long as she is eating GOOD food.    Either way though - DON'T GIVE IN just because she says she is hungry unless you give her carrots, celery, fresh fruit or something that is healthy with little to no calories.  We can all - at any age - develop a very bad habit of just EATING TO EAT - females especially.  The FEELING of hunger sometimes indicates a need for water and/or sleep if she isn't getting enough of either of those too.    And, last but not least - FEELING hungry doesn't equal starvation!  It doesn't HARM HER to have the feeling of hunger.  So what - it will pass and she will live and she will not be harmed by not eating JUST because she has a FEELING or habit to eat.  It's sort of like when a baby cries - we have this TENDENCY to always pick them up even when we shouldn't necessarily ALWAYS DO SO - I adopted the idea over time that "they are just cryin - they aren't dyin" and the same could be said about the feeling of "hunger"....    Just my thoughts....|`|flqAr30laa	does she exercise alot? is she very active? that burns lots of calories and she needs more fuel.  i have an 8yr sister who is of normal weight, but she's running all over the place and eats all day long.  Besides, ideally adults should eat something every 3 hrs to help regulate your blood sugar.|`|hkQSqPEwaa	honestly, I think you are picking on her..  would you feel the same if it was your son.  No, you would say he is growing.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	because you are letting her get away with it...set rules, give consequences and stick to them...each and every time.  This is a vehavior problem...take control.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My 7 year old is like this, and is going through a big growth spurt at the moment... I give her a small snack around 11, like an apple, 1/2 of a yogurt, a cheese stick, pack of fruit snacks, etc.   I do not allow her to eat a lot, as i don't want her to become overweight.... and according to standards she already is... she is 4ft10 and weighs 72lbs. She is a little big for her age, in all ways. I just make shure what i feed her is healthy, and make shure that she gets enough exercise throughout the day. As long as you do all these things your child should be fine.  I will tell you that if this is an excessive problem and you can't do any thing to help it, she proabally has depression. It can cause you to eat like this at an early age. Do not give in to her and get her some help to solve the problem rather than the symptom if you think this is what is going on. Yes children that age can get depression.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If she is normal weight, let her.  If not, ask her doctor.  Maybe she's having a growth spurt.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	give her a snack in between meals. kids eat a lot but she need to slow because he may affect her weight later on.|`|Ovd3Lfqaaa	maybe she has a tape worm|`|zcZGRPc2aa	almost the same as my 2yr old son lol except he wants to have food in front of him constantly. i say give her snacks every hour or so or whenever she says she's hungry. now don't give me a thumbs down just yet people by snacks i mean carrot sticks,celery sticks, healthy stuff ya know.|`|B2dQop3oaa	1 If she ate any uncooked (or not properly cooked) fish or meat, then have her checked for worms.  2. If she's overweight/plain fat, decrease on the food you give her.  3. DO NOT FEED YOUR CHILDREN MCDONALDS(like) FOOD. It is BAD for them and their IQ.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	There could be alot of reasons for this.  One...she is having a growing spurt.  Two, she may be on her school schedule.  My d lunch is at ll and she is starving on sat when she has to go to our schedule!  She is starving when she gets home at 4 from the bus....and I willl tell you she is not overweight at all.   Another thing could be you are expecting her to eat the same amount as you or as your six year old which wouldnt be accurate.  Another thing...  is her mother having problems with feeding her?  I mean kids who are poor or dont have food at home will hoard food and even hide food when they get somewhere wherer there is plentiful.    If you know its boredom, for sure, then you need to enroll her in some fun stuff at the community center, or dance lessons,or skating or something. She may need structured activities schedule. Some kids will just sit in front of the tv if they dont have plans.  It seems alot of kids have lost the ability to entertain themselves!   If you feel in your heart she is developing an eating disorder then you need to put her in some counseling before it gets out of hand.    Is she obese? Talk to your family pedicatrition too.    good luck hon.|`|2Q1oTN9laa	It could be an early sign of puberty.  Or it could be a growth spurt.  Or it could be that children-sized servings aren't enough anymore.  As long as her weight and health seem to be normal, I don't see a problem with it.  In most public school the kids have "snack time" between the start of school and lunch, maybe it's habit for her.  Try healthy snacks every two hours between meals.
S1gJJHNzaa	to me (aside from the 9 cm cyst i developed my second cycle of clomid using 50mg) the worst part is that clomid side effects mirror early pregnancy symptoms.. is that a cruel joke or what!?!    i always get super bloated up around 12dpo with clomid too.    but hang on there, at least you are being proactive and the odds are in your (our) favor.    good luck and God bless!    edited to add because it messes with your hormones|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. Here is the thing with Clomid. They mimic pregnancy symptoms. ORRRR you could be pregnant! ill cross my fingers you have a bun in the oven!!! 
bI7wMCJXaa	Pacifiers are evil!!! The best way to kick this would be to take the pacifier away from him just before he falls asleep so he'll know it's gone. Or just don't give it to him at all before bed.|`|VS8mactUaa	As for kicking the habit, it may make a thumb sucker, for the time being, get a pacifier that clips on to his pj's. I had one of those.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	does he have a nightlight so he can see the  passys?|`|uXMqQ6GNaa	Do not give him at middle of the night. He will definitely cry for few minutes and go back to sleep. it might happen for 2-3 days and he will forget it.|`|zwctZ812aa	I just go into my son's room when he wakes up at night and give him his pacifier back.  It only takes a second, and then he is happy and will go back to sleep.  That way I can go back to sleep too. If all he wants is his pacifier, just get up and go give it to him.|`|28WJwHf4aa	Put more than one pacifier in his crib. He's bound to find one and settle down.    My friend had a little boy that would do this same thing. They found a teddy bear with a pouch in the front, and then put a few pacifiers in the pouch. That way when he woke up and couldn't find one, he knew to look in the tummy of the bear. He was a little older than 7 mos. old though, so that may not work.|`|fPRnwd8Taa	How about one of those clips that clips on their clothes and hooks on the dummy. when it falls it won't go far and he'd soon learn how to find it.?|`|nuVJj1Mfaa	My niece kind of did the same thing with not being able to locate the 1 paci in the crib and I know this may sound silly but we put like 3 of them in there.. Her chances were better at finding one. Hope it works for ya!
shKc7lZcaa	It might mess it up some.... You might not be able to track your period as acurately either.  I had to "re-adjust" after mine.

MubTZUKXaa	It does seem too soon.  And you are right, 3 cycles of Clomid tend to be the norm.  I actually tried 6 cycles of Clomid before IUI.    The only way you will know his reasons for wanting you to do an IUI sooner than normal is to ask him (and he may have reasons).    I never had Clomid when I done my IUI, I used injectibles as the success rate is slightly improved.  The IUI itself is a walk in the park, it doesn't hurt although you may have mild cramping after.  It feels like period pain.  The pain is gone before you get up from the table and after you feel totally normal.  The procedure itself is perfomed very quickly.    I ovulated on each of the 6 clomid cycles I done but never once became pregnant.  After 3 1/2 years TTC I became pregnant after my first IUI, I'm now 25 weeks.  So in my case I wish we had just jumped to IUI straight away!  But alot of Women do conceive with Clomid alone.  Just do what you feel comfortable with xx Good luck xx|`|AAbGMKo5aa	Yeah is 2 soon to have an iui  Everytime my aunt wants to get pregnant sht takes clomid and it always take her 8 months to conceived she has 3 kids and ttc  4 and she is on her 4 month of clomid...    Just tell ur doctor u don't want to do it ...|`|yW9R8mapaa	I did IUI with Clomid. It depends on the circumstances really. What is your reasoning behind seeing a re? My husband had a low sperm count and bad motility so our doc didn't see any sense on giving me clomid without IUI. We did it 3 times and it didn't work. Is the problem that you can't ovulate without it? I would talk to your doc and see what he says. Sometimes they do get ahead of themselves so I would see what his reasoning is. But I've been told by a couple of different doctors that being on clomid for more that 6 cycles isn't really good for you. I don't know for sure, but my doc told me that and so did my friends obgyn, so. I would talk to your doc then talk to your husband about it. They can't make you do it so if you want to wait, wait. But I would take whatever the doc says into consideration.
AA12311882	No. You were in your safe days.  The safe days not to get pregnant are actually seven (7) days before  and seven (7) days after the first day of menstruation (for 28 days cycle). This is the principle used in the Rhythm Method of Family planning or Contraception.    The morning you had your period was a safe day.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Have you never taken a health class?  -_-    You don't get a period when you're pregnant.

It would be wise to use protection to avoid getting pregnant ( as well as to reduce the risk of Sexually Transmitted Disease) - I have seen lots of complications from STDs in my line of work,and believe me prevention is better than cure (plus,... some things cannot be reversed/cured)
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey i am so sorry for your loss x    Yes they will take extra precaution, i sadly lost my baby to stillbirth last month and ive been told by my midwife that i will have extra care, more scans and weekly visits next time round.    Try not to worry too much, and relax, you will get so much extra care, your be pampered.  Good luck ttc  xx
pXSKSS3daa	She's only three months old and her sleeping schedule sounds completely normal for that age. Waking every 2-3 hours is normal and you don't need to do anything. She'll sleep longer periods when she's able to and not when you want her to, unfortunately.    We've used the nighttime bath products and lotions and I never noticed a difference in my son's sleeping patterns versus using regular bath products.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	the night time lotions not only did not work for my son, but all the fragrance in them broke his sensitive skin out.    im just curious, does she sleep @ all during the day? waking up every 3-4 hrs at night sounds about right still.     could u give a lil more info about her daytime sleeping habits?|`|upvch2BRaa	I had my 10 month son sleeping through the night at 2 and a half  months, and this is what worked for me. For a while he was going to bed at 9 (i was thinking the later he stays up the later he would sleep) and usually I would get him up right before i went to bed at 11:30, because he was waking up around 2 for a bottle. Well one day I put him down and didn't get him up at 11:30, and he slept till 4! i was so excited so when I put him down the next day and he woke up at 1 I went in with a pacifier, gave him a blanket and tried to let im cry and maybe fall asleep, he did! it only took about 15 minutes, i wasn't going to let him go any longer then 20. We did this for about a month and when he was 2 months old and 4am started to get tiring i would give him his bed time bottle at 7 and a few more ounces maybe even a whole bottle, depending on what he wanted to take an hour and a half later and put him down for bed. he slept till 6! After that I adjusted a nap schedule and he was happily sleeping from 9 till 730. its a trial and error getting them to sleep. Just adjust some naps, try for a little extra food, and you will be there in no time good luck to you!!|`|7kosr9mcaa	what helped me was i put my son on rice cereal..but only gave it to him before bed. once i started that he skipped the 2 am feeding and didnt wake until 6am. i started using those bedtime bath and lotions and they worked to calm him down, he had bad colic and they seemed to relax him a bit.|`|Ddb5821Jaa	My little 3 month old boy does the same night schedule you do. But even after 'waking up to start the day at 8" the next feeding I will lay down with him and that way we both get a good 30min to hour more of rest.  Sometimes if we both are wired and awake and playing,we have to wait for lunchtime to take our nap again together.  From what I have read, sleeping through the night at 3 months means 5-6 hours straight. They need the nutrition so often because they have small stomachs and are developing in great amounts.  I think as long as overall your baby is getting a minimum of 12 hours of sleep throughout the day(24 hours period) is good.  Good Luck!|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Johnson's bedtime bath was a big help for me. But I guess it just depends on the baby. If you formula feed you can add a little rice cereal to a warm bottle before she goes to bed. Best of luck!|`|jLNwrVZRaa	What helped me the most was getting on a schedule.  Every night for 3-4 weeks straight we would give my son a bath, then give him a bottle and then have him in bed by 8pm.  For the first week it was a little tough but by the second week he was sleeping from 8pm until 3-4am.  And then, to our surprise, we put him to bed at 8pm on Christmas eve and he didn't wake up until 6:15am on Christmas day and he has been sleeping through the night ever since.

nBlSS6HUaa	Usually your local YMCA's have a little room called the 'Padded Room' where they have mats, and toys all made out of wresteling mats. And they are usually pretty full when theres cold weather. But besides that..maybe Chick Fil A (the ones here have a indoor play area..although at his age there won't be a whole lot he can do). You can also look up your local churches. Maybe they have a play area. We have a new church in our area that has a HUGE indoor playground, and it's free.  GOOD LUCK hun!  by the way..we live in Ohio|`|Dq4VswJ6aa	google works wonders.
CuCrGDuRaa	Did your doctor advise you to use that cream?  My doctor told me to absolutely never use yeast infection cream during pregnancy.  They usually prescribe a Diflucan pill to take instead.  If your doctor didn't tell you to use that cream, stop taking it and call your doctor's office ASAP.|`|iMULlxdgaa	call your doctor I think using over the counter creams is not good,  I have ayeast infection right now and I only use the topical cream becuase I want to ask my doctor if she cna give me a precription for something I can take.  Just use topical cream for now (unless your doctor gave you the go ahead)  But- don't stress yourself like the other responder said you do have a mucus plug and the baby is encased in teh amniotic sack,  so the baby is most liekly fine...but just don't use anymore until your doctor give the go ahead.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	It can't get to your baby, you have a mucous plug that blocks the opening of the cervix, and your baby is encased within a sealed membrane, the amniotic sac.

zK1V9Mu7aa	You will be very uncomfortable, sleeping will be a pain, walking will be agony and you will just want that baby out of you!  The waiting will just be agonising. One piece of advice though - ignore your EDD, if you base your special day around that date you will more than likely be disappointed when he doesn't come that day!  Good Luck!  xxx|`|iMULlxdgaa	hi-5 friend!  me too!  I'm due a few weeks myself and even though its my 2nd ...I feel so anxious and every crampo I'm like "no not now,  its a bad time!"  I feel like such a chicken.  But yet I want to hold my abbay I just don't want ot go through labor.  I got lucky the first time I hardly felt contractions and they put me on pictocin as soon as I went to the hopital after I lost my plug then it was epidural and pushing  but no pain...I was cool, but now...who knows what will happen!  I wish they could justy induce me so I would know the exact day,  I don't like this surprise attack on my body feeling!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	First off calm down.  There is no reason to be afraid.  Just think about how wonderful your new baby is going to be and get plenty of water and rest.  If you are scared it will make the pain worse.  When you go into labor your contractions will be very painful if you are having fear/anxiety.  Calm down, pace yourself.  If you have any unresolved issues, start working them out now and clear your mind.  You will, within the next 1 to 6 weeks, be holding your precious newborn.  And by the way, baby can feel your fear and will hesitate to come out if you have fear whether contractions have started or not because your body doesn't want to release baby if there is danger and that is what fear is interpreted as.  Good luck, be easy|`|HvALvdc7aa	Fear, anticipation, anxiety. All that good stuff. Good Luck|`|RtIGiGrkaa	I think not knowing when your water is going to break will be the hardest part, i know that is what will scare me.

Good luck and Congrats!|`|AA10196172	I'm sure you know...    As soon as you are showing, every woman who ever had a baby will tell you all about her 37 hours of agonizing labour or her massive C-section scar. If you haven't heard any such stories by now, consider yourself lucky.    However, most women say that having a child was the best thing they ever did, and they would do it all over again and it was worth the effort. I think they just enjoy scaring first-time mothers with exaggerated stories. Just write yourself a letter about how you are feeling now, and you can read it and laugh in 4 months (If you can stay awake!)    I bet the worst part is the waiting. They say a lot of women are late the first time, so it may be 6 weeks. (There. That's my contributon to the horror stories!)    Congratulations, and good luck.|`|GBijP0Ddaa	You will just be playing the waiting game.  your body will most likely start practicing with braxtin hicks--make sure you know the difference, about this time you can go into real labor anytime now.  You might have already dropped and your mucus plug probrably came out.  Just wait to either your water breaks or your contractions get 5 minutes apart.    Hint sometimes you think you peed on yourself when your water breaks, you will know if its your water when two seconds later you feel like using the bathroom again, and again.      just wait. . . . . . im so exited for you!|`|O5WJGTmVaa	You are probably feeling tired and sore.  But you are almost there.  For me, each of my pregnancies were the best times of my life.  The fear and anxiety is normal.  You'll know you are close to delivery when you get a burst of energy and start cleaning or re-arranging furniture.  How ever don't do any heavy work if you haven't been doing it through the pregnancy.  With my daughter, I was outside pulling up bushes that I hated.  The beginning contractions are a breeze, they feel more like cramps.  Good luck on your beautiful little baby who is soon too come!!  Everything will fall into place naturally and you will know when its time.  And don't worry as a parent, you learn as you go!

Up6wkVLvaa	Sometimes it takes a while for contraception to leave your body and also it doesn't always happen that easily for people anyway.  Although you can guarantee the one time you do risk it, you'll get pregnant!  Also your husband could be infertile or not very fertile.  Good Luck though!|`|2nfMSDiPaa	Hey hun you can be pregnant if the home pregnancy test results are negative. This may be due to a number of reasons and is called a false negative. This means that you are actually pregnant and the test results are misleading. Home pregnancy tests determine pregnancy through the detection of the hormone Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) in a womans urine. Doctors recommend that you wait until you have missed a period to take a home pregnancy test. If you can not wait that long to find out and you know the day you may have conceived, then the earliest you can take a test would be 14 days from possible conception. Home tests are usually 97% accurate when all instructions are followed correctly and the results are read on time. Some kits come with two tests so that in case you have made a mistake, you may take the home pregnancy tests gain.    If I was you take blood test to put your mind at rest!    May God bless you with a child!  Tons of baby dust to you!  !Good-luck!!
lFCGpPdnaa	This is a interesting question. My mother have six children and in 1968-9 she would go to the grocery store and pay twenty dollars for enough food for a week. Can you believe that? Now just my husband and me with diabetes pay hundred or more a week if we buy the right stuff that will not kill us. And my daughter-in law pay eight hundred to nine a month for food for six children and two adults, at the cheapest food store in town. The sad thing about that is it's not healthy food it's something to eat so they won't starve. Very sad!|`|rAkWoweOaa	We have 4 in our family, but my husband has two friends that eat with us almost every night. (ugh!) I spend $600 a month on groceries, sometimes more.|`|AWqGmJUxaa	it cost about 150 as i have 6 in my House hold and that is what it takes to feed them
7kosr9mcaa	i pumped 8 times a day for 6 weeks and then lost my milk...good luck to you, hope you do better than me!    are you taking domperidone? it can increase your milk supply. ask your doc if your not already taking it.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I pumped for 3 months for my preemie son who wouldn't latch. I will tell you what- get that baby on the breast! Exclusively pumping takes so much time and it is so tiring. It also makes your supply slowly go down until you dry up. If I could have breast fed- it would have been so much easier. It takes about 20 minutes each time. when you have to take care of a baby 20 minutes is a long time! My milk dried up after 3 months and I had to start on formula. I got through it- but it was rough. Maybe you should schedule an appointment with a lactation consultant before giving up on nursing. I did but my son was just too small to latch but I wanted him to have the benefits of breast milk. It was a long and tiring 3 months!|`|rAkWoweOaa	When I exclusively pumped my supply lasted about two weeks, then I had no more milk. That was just my experience though.|`|OZ474DMYaa	my experience was, i pumped for 5 weeks or so but my son wasn't gaining weight well due to a medical issue with me so then i had to switch he is a very healthy 5 month old now.    why the thumbs down for my medical issue. i choose to let my son be healthy and gain weight and for that i am wrong? oh please. it doesnt matter how you feed your baby as long as they are growing and healthy.|`|CNlfn5Wraa	My son would not latch and he never breastfed. I pumped  from day one until he was 4 months.(I couldn't get anymore milk and it was starting to hurt) I really don't think you will get to a year but everyone is different. No matter what happens you have given you baby the most beneficial nutrients that she can have. My son was never sick until he was 3 years old. Hooray for you!|`|AWqGmJUxaa	i did it and it was not nice it is really sore and i had to do it about 6 times a day|`|1fc95a9e9025a0f00398e482b7d9ccd5aa	my daughter is almost 5 months and I have been pumping since day one because she didn't want to stay on the breast. i pump every 4 hours 5 times a day. i don't think my milk supply has gone down. each pump is about 4oz. so i feed her 3 bottles (6 1/2oz each) of breastmilk a day and 2 bottles of formula. i plan to pump for a year but it has been very tiring and time consuming to pump, wash, feed, etc... but i think the benefits are well worth the time. my daughter's been sick with the cold and cough once....
xb2Df33eaa	Call DCFS on her and report her for not taking care of the kid's health. If the child is always sick then she is ignoring the health of the minor, it does not matter what you work on, your kids health should come first.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	call the parent, it just takes a minute of their time, and they may want to scedule a Dr. appointment..|`|0qP8gLpyaa	For a kid to always be sick continually is not normal. Sure children get a bug here or there that has them under the weather, but it should not be an ongoing thing.  Either your friend isn't being straight with you or they are neglecting to get the medical treatment that is needed for her with the right doctors.    Personally if she's throwing up, running a fever, has skin rashes or discharge from eyes, nose or ears then she's contagious and doesn't need to be around anyone. She needs a doctor and bed rest, not being dropped off at your home where you or any children you have in the home besides her can become ill from exposure.  If you get sick then you'll be worthless to watch her or anyone else because you'll need to recoop.    I'd start documenting these things, call the mom and document it and the outcome. If you see an unhealthy pattern develop from it I'd call for some help to intervene and look into the situation- even if that means calling in CPS to look into the situation to be sure nothing funny is going on.  Nurse or not, it seems a little neglectful of the mother to know her child is always ill and not start seeking specialists to investigate what is going on.|`|RQc8fbjbaa	I think you should ask the mom what are appropriate times for you to call her.|`|AA10531094	Tell the mom your concerns. List everything that concerns you and discuss it with the mom.  I would have the mom sign some kind of waiver if in the future, she tried to accuse me of not getting help or getting the wrong kind of help. If you're still not comfortable. . . tell her she'll have to find a daycare with a certified nurse. If it were my child I would want you to call me.  My child is first. . . I can always get another job.  Good Luck!|`|0fbb5e27ed4790306bd5062233798e68aa	Yes call the parents. Even if you are comfortable watching her she should still know what is going on. What if she took her to the doctor and they asked if she had been throwing up and the mother did not know because you did not call her.. The answer is yes call her... Duh!!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I'm sure the mother is fully aware of the child's medical conditions.  If she's not contagious and you aren't worried about spreading it to all the other children that you care for, then its your call.  You said you were comfortable caring for her though, so.....|`|o5rfI7oUaa	U do the right by calling the child's parents duhhh|`|1cfd26f25289a1245a86fe8db1bf3dc2aa	YES. Always call the parents. Especially if she threw up. First of all, she shouldn't be in your care if she is sick, and second the parent needs to know that she is. This, if anything reduces your responsibility for treating her. Also, as a child care provider, it is your responsibility, if you think it is neglect on the parent's part, to report it. The little girl needs to be taken care of, and does not need to suffer because you feel bad for calling her mom. Call and call often!!|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Okay if your a good friend of the mother then she will trust you and ask her what she wants you to do when she brings the kid over and to give you some medicine for her when shes sick as long as you know how to take care of her then it should be fine just ask the mom what to call for and what not to call for.|`|xmzvUFR3aa	If the child has health problems and it sick often, there's no need to call the mother and tell her that her daughter is sick because she'll already know that or wouldn't be surprised. If the child is sicker than usual and you're worried, that would be the time to call her mother.|`|Oi3GTByKaa	If its not an emergency, I would mention it when mom comes to get her.  If your friend is a nurse and she is aware of her child's problems, she's prob. doing all she can for her. Some kids are just sick alot. I'm sure your friend wants to know about what happens with her daughter, but she has to work in order to take care of her financially so I would wait to talk to her til after she is off work.|`|tO7lBnMfaa	Unfortunately if you are running a daycare the answer is yes no matter how great of a friend they are. According to Il licensing regulations( this may be different where you live) you must have an area in your home to isolate the child if they become ill. You are also required to call the parents or emergency contact to pick up the child if you suspect they are contagious. As a daycare provider it is your responsibilty to protect ALL of the children you care for and this should have been stipulated in you contract.    Now as a human being it may be hard to turn away such a brave little girl but you must protect yourself and your business.|`|49d74bd8b100117274d25e31b1942932aa	It depends.     If she is throwing up - and they can't figure out whats wrong with her - maybe its a stomach problem and something that she's not going to pass on to another child.       For me,  If I feel like its going to be passed on to another child (throwing up)  - I call the parents.|`|WInyhO09aa	if it were me, i would want you to call me. no matter how busy she may be or how dumb you may feel, that child's mama or daddy needs to  know what's going on with her. What if you didn't call and one day it was to late? I would always call her parents and let them no, no matter what.|`|q8nkzBspaa	I know that when I worked at a daycare it was mandatory to call the parents if the child was ill. They could not be there if they were contagious. You may feel bad but it is her mother and she needs to know about whats going on. Believe me you dont want the liability of knowing she was sick, not calling, and having something bad actually happen to her. Leave it to the mother to deal with.

wphLaVs6aa	Breastmilk and formula are in no way equal. Breastmilk is far superior.  That might not be a popular statement, and it's in no way intended to judge formula-feeding moms. But it's really true. Formula is a great alternative when breastfeeding isn't possible, but it isn't really a close second.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is good for both the mother and the baby. The benefits are astounding actually!<br>  <br>  BABY:<br>  - immunities from mom's breast milk mean fewer sicknesses<br>  - fewer allergies<br>  - less constipation<br>  - reduced risk of obesity later in life<br>  - fewer ear infections<br>  - improved jaw and teeth development<br>  - better eyesight development<br>  - higher IQs later in life<br>  - lower incidence of diabetes<br>  - lower incidence of childhood cancers<br>  <br>  MOTHER:<br>  - faster pregnancy weight loss<br>  - decreased risk of breast cancer and other cancers later in life<br>  - bonding with baby<br>  <br>  Pregnancy causes saggy breasts, not breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  You can actually get MORE sleep breastfeeding a newborn than bottle feeding if you cosleep. I fed my son at night for many months and never once got out of bed to do it. Our family slept much better than formula feeding families who had to get up, warm a bottle and feed the baby.<br>  <br>  My husband helps me constantly. The only thing he can't do is breastfeed. But he changes diapers, dresses our baby, cleans up, cooks me dinner (feeding me feeds our baby!). He is also solely in charge of bath time, so he has one job that I never do.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding, after the first few months, is 1) easier (no bottles to clean, formula to bring with you when you leave home, 2) far less expensive, 3) healthier for baby, 4) healthier for mom, and 5) great for bonding.<br>  <br>  Here are some links:<br>  <a href="http://www.lightlink.com/hilinda/Diane/breastorbottle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lightlink.com/hilinda/Diane/b...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T020300.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T020300...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T020400.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T020400...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T021600.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/2/T021600...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.promom.org/bf_info/why_bf.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.promom.org/bf_info/why_bf.htm</a>|`|4HoVVCenaa	It passes on immunities to the baby.

I don't have a lot of experience with breast feeding, but my advice is for you to try it. You are the only one that will know if it will work for you or not. :) It's much cheaper!! Good luck!|`|Gem96NQyaa	Like many thinks, there are pros and cons.<br>  <br>  Probably the biggest pro is that breast feeding is incredibly good for the baby and the baby's immune system.  Breast milk is also much easier to digest than formulas.<br>  <br>  A con is that, yes, it can affect your breasts.  In the short term, they'll actually get bigger, as they'll be swollen with milk.  They can also be much more tender than usual.  And in the long term, yeah, they may sag a bit if you don't wear the right bra.<br>  <br>  As far as your husband not being able to help... that's so not true.  Very few mothers feed exclusively from the breast.  Most pump and store the milk in bottles so that they always have a surplus for those times when breast feeding just isn't possible.<br>  <br>  As for "never being able to sleep"...  you won't be sleeping much, whether you're breastfeeding or not.  Infants need feeding every two hours or so, and someone's got to be awake to do it.|`|tmh42R6Caa	There is no right answer here.  Both options (breast vs formula) are perfectly fine.  I breastfed for 6 weeks, but I had to give up because I was having A LOT of trouble.  If you want to try breastfeeding (which I recommend) definitely speak to a lactation consultant while you're in the hospital.  They can make sure you're doing it correctly so you don't have the problems I had.  However, breast milk does not have all the vitamins formula does, so you need to supplement with liquid vitamins (poly-vi-sol).  They're both fine choices.  I would suggest breastfeeding at first.  If you don't, and your milk disappears, it's near impossible to get it back.|`|AA11737190	I think that breast feeding is the best if it works for you. My daughter is eight days old. My wife is breast feeding. I have been tempted on more than one occasion to bring home a can of formula, but it is getting easier.<br>  <br>  The important thing is to find what works for you. Don't worry about what your mom or anyone else thinks.

AA11920812	We are doing the less and less method. Every night I am taking away 2 oz until there is nothing left. If he wants a drink before bed that is fine, it will be in a cup. Haven`t got to the empty bottle yet though ;P I imagine it will be a struggle at first!<br>  <br>  (My girlfriend gave up and let her daughter take a sippy cup to bed. But, I don`t see the point in that. It seems like the same habit to me)|`|paHbLR9aaa	I don't really understand the question here.  If he has been drinking out of a cup for 18 months, what is a night bottle?  Once my daughter took a cup, all the bottles were thrown away.|`|5ZdB5K6Raa	The only thing i did with my daughter is just took the bottle away from her at night i would give her a sippy cup right before she went to bed, but when she went to lay down i would take it away from her! she cried for a few nights but hey she off the bottle now at night
Y9GdwvnWaa	Keep an eye on the calendar  Use your day planner or another simple calendar to mark the day your period begins each month. Also track the number of days each period lasts. If you have a consistent 28-day cycle, ovulation is likely to begin about 14 days after the day your last period began.    If your cycles are somewhat long, subtract 18 from the number of days in your shortest cycle. When your next period begins, count ahead this many days. The next week is a reasonable guess for your most fertile days.    Watch for changes in cervical mucus  Just before ovulation, you might notice an increase in clear, slippery vaginal secretions  if you look for it. These secretions typically resemble raw egg whites. After ovulation, when the odds of becoming pregnant are slim, the discharge will become cloudy and sticky or disappear entirely    Try an ovulation monitoring kit  Over-the-counter ovulation kits test your urine for the surge in hormones that takes place before ovulation. For the most accurate results, follow the instructions on the label to the letter.    Have sex regularly. If you consistently have sex two or three times a week, you're almost certain to hit a fertile period at some point. For healthy couples who want to conceive, there's no such thing as too much sex. For many couples, this may be all it takes.     Have sex once a day near the time of ovulation. Daily intercourse during the days leading up to ovulation may increase the odds of conception. Although your partner's sperm concentration will drop slightly each time you have sex, the reduction isn't usually an issue for healthy men.     Make healthy lifestyle choices. Maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, eat healthy foods and keep stress under control. The same good habits will serve you and your baby well during pregnancy.|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	You must know when you ovulate, that is the number one priority when TTC. There are only about 36 - 48 hours a month when you are fertile. Having sex every other day won't help if you are missing your window. Get ovulation kits to help you out. All the advice about positions and herbs won't help you if you miss your window. Keep in mind that if you're under the age of 30, the average length of time to concieve is still about 6 months, even with help.
9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Sounds weird, but the vitamin Geritol has many postive responses for pregnancy.  Hubby and I had been trying for a baby for a while with no success - he started taking Geritol and within a month we were expecting (and it wasn't even during my fertile time - kinda odd)    Can't hurt to try - we need vitamins anyway!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Google, Fertility Blend for Women. =)  That's what I used when I was having troubles getting pregnant.|`|FP8Avd3oaa	I don't think so, sorry!|`|Wok0Y6ebaa	There are websites where you can buy fertility meds without going to the doctor, but the medications come from overseas, and there is no way to know if it is safe or even the right kind of medication.  Just spring the money to go to the doctor and get a valid prescription!!  If you can afford a baby, then you can afford the doctors appointment.  And take prenatal vitamins and zinc to make yourself healthier before you get pregnant.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	It is very dangerous to purchase and take fertility drugs without a prescription from your doctor. If you want to increase your fertility, go to a vitamin store and purchase a prenatal multivitamin along with Vitex(also known as agnus castus or chasteberry).
oA8Rtyxuaa	Stick to your guns and keep him out of the child's life and yours. If he did it once hes bound to do it again. Im so sorry that you have to do this on your own, if you need someone to talk to you can email me. I got pregnant when I was 17, the father and I tried to work on things (he was abusive and controlling) but I finally left him two years ago. My daughter is now almost 4, she sees him once or twice a week, no court order...he hasn't ever done anything to her but I watch it very closely. Again, im so sorry you have to do this on your own! Best of luck to you and your precious baby!!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	You say he attempted to kill you.  Do you want this person, the way he is, around your child.      I would make some serious guidelines and rules he must abide by before letting him in your home again or around you baby.   First, have him take anger management.   Second, have him seek a different form of consuleing.  Make him have a job and set up child support before visitation.  And have him prove that he can be responsible.     Attempting to harm you or even threatening you is serious stuff!  You need to protect you and your child first and foremost.  If he can show you he is learning to coop with his anger issues and also show you that he can be a responsible parent, at that point possibly consider letting him in your childs life.  AND this is only if he can prove to you he is going to be responsible and safe around your daughter.  Make him prove it, talk is cheap, don't rely on his word only.|`|HYlWlETAaa	First of all call the police and have him arrested for violating the restraining order.  They may also arrest him for domestic violence.  Go to family court and get his parental rights revoked.  This should get him away for a while.  Don't know your state laws but you need also get a paternity test to prove his fatherhood.  The court should assign child support.  Truthfully you may need to move and not leave forwarding information to get away from him.  Don't feel bad he has proved he is not safe to have around the child.      Good luck  Kevin|`|XLsnuAqmaa	honey, if he is dangerous STAY away from him.  you don't need him.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	I may be mistaken...but I beleive that since you got a restraining order on him you can also go to the courts and get soul custody and then have the court order...supervised visits only with your child...that way if he is truley intersted in being a father he will...if he has other motives then you can rest assured that your child is in a safe environment with a shaparone.   also may i add...seek counsling!!!|`|Ddb5821Jaa	You are a good person for still having compassion towards him and his daughters relationship.  BUT, his actions towards you is not healthy.  Since you are MOM, and baby will need YOU (not him) for EVERYTHING. Best is to go the 'legal' way for him to get visitation.  He is trying to schmooze back in, and it is not fair to YOU. of course you want him to see her! but since papers are filed and you two have a history, do it the legal way.  Also, I would try and find good community support for yourself, so you don't feel like you need the JERK around.|`|Yz2TvEMlaa	his rights end when he tries to harm both you and your unborn child. a father in normal circumstances has rights to his child, but when he has a history of violence it's a different story.|`|UFo1Fnqcaa	get the hell outta there!

"I need help this is my first child?"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Wow.    Look at your previous questions and then tell me you are not a fake.    You had sex 4 days ago? Its too early to tell anyways.  Calm down and please stop blabbing about your sex life.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	You had sex 4 days ago and you think you're pregnant. Why?|`|HpWCjBv6aa	It's only been four days.  You would not be showing symptoms of pregnancy yet, and you would not be able to tell whether or not you are pregnant.  The pregnancy hormone hCG will show up about fourteen days past the sex in question.  So you need to wait at least ten more days before you take a pregnancy test and start freaking out.
S3WeYrVgaa	Yes, there should be a form that WIC can give you for you dr to fill out (if your dr doesn't have the forms already).  They call it a prescription (or at least my state does).|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	yes my neice had to have that.  Although they will probably still make you try soy and such first because they are cheap like that.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Yes, my nephew is on it, covered by WIC.|`|2TAFN9lzaa	Yes, if WIC in your state works the same as mine. My son was on Alimentum and WIC provided 8 cans a month if I remember right.|`|jWFeb8jiaa	Yes, I had to bring in a dr's prescription and they covered it with no problem.|`|Ezkn5azdaa	Yes. Requested by the doctor. Make sure your doctor said they already try the Similac Advance and Similac Isonmil first before putting on the formula. I seen the form because my baby girl doctor switch formula to Alimentum kind.

r7dYHFLtaa	I'm on the same boat..    It's going to be hard,but hopefully will get use to it,and we both should be FINE !|`|9QVjNaIPaa	just be thankful that you have a family member to leave her with and you don't have to put her in daycare. when i had my first i thought that was what i was going to have to do but then my grandma offered to take care of my baby for me instead. it made it so much easier knowing she was with family and it was only one person looking after one baby instead of someone i dont know looking after multiple kids. it made it easier just knowing that while i was doing what i had to do to provide for my family and give my baby the best possible life, she was getting to spend quality time with grandma. its hard leaving them but it makes you feel so good when you pick them up and they are so happy to see you. just put up some pics of your baby around your 'work area' and dont feel hesitant to call and check up on her!|`|QT5ROElraa	It's difficult, but of course knowing your family is taking care of her will make it much easier... just imagine putting her into a day care. that is very difficult. One good thing is she will look forwards to you coming home, and you get to see the "cute" side of her, and really enjoy the time you spend with her. A person that is with her all day might get frustrated, worn out... and you are coming in and just spend time with her.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	We started child care at 3 months. It was hard for the first few days but after that it was great. She got a lot of stimulation at daycare and structure. She loved it and I had a lot of trust for our caregiver. It will get easier and easier. Good Luck!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I went back to work when my son was 4 months and worked part time he was staying with my mom and it was still sooooo hard!  Consider yourself lucky that you have family to keep him I would die if I had to leave him at daycare!  It will be hard I cried for a week straight!  But it does get easier but you never want to leave them my son is 2 and I still hate to leave him  2 is due in may and I am only gonna get 6 weeks with him so that is going to be really hard for me!  Good luck!!  I know how you feel so many of us have been there but we have to do what we have to do to keep our heads above water... :)|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	I know it hard to leave your child at this young of an age .Just knowing that she is with someone who loves her should make you feel better. Your MIL only wants to do the best things for her I'm sure and I think it's good for kids to have adequate time with their grandparents. I was the same way until my son got a little older. I didn't really feel comfortable leaving him with anyone until he was prob 6 or 7 months old. So hopefully you will be able to relax a little bit after everyone gets into the groove of things. And it's only 3 hours, that's hardly enough time to mess anything up!   Unless her grandma is untrustworthyor irresponsible, it concerns me a little that you are so afraid of leaving her with your MIL. I was very close with my grandparents my whole life and it was one of the most rewarding relationships I ever had in my life. I just hope that you will realize it is very important for kids to see their grandparents on a regular basis, it is good for the soul! (P.S like I said I know it is still very early and understandable that you are freaking out but sometimes you just have to do it and get it over with and then you feel better and wonder why you were so freaked out in the first place. I did that a lot with my in laws, but now my son gets to see them about once a week and sometimes he even stays the night and they all love it! (he is almost one)|`|x3fQP9viaa	What helps to get through this is the fact you have family with your child, the best group of caregivers.  It sounds like you have an excellent support group.|`|VEi3R0craa	it is hard and I have four kids with my youngest being 3 months and I am just lucky my husband work hours allow him to be home with the baby while I am at work.  But I feel like he gets the best being able to see all his first.  Like this morning I was like look what the baby just did and he was like he did that 3 days ago.  It broke my heart.|`|60a7e3ffd573059c61c0954b767554aaaa	Going back to work is hard! I know you don't want to leave you precious baby for any time. Trust me though, it is going to feel so much better to be out of the house and making money and back in the swing of things. I know from experience that a little time away from baby can be a good thing! Just enough to refresh you so when you return to her you have a clear head and have had good baby-free adult interaction to balance your life.   Trust your mother in law. She raised your husband, and possibly other kids..she's a pro. I know M.I.L.'s can be a pain, but she will do nothing but love that baby. You are lucky to have someone willing to take care of her that loves her! Imagine having to put her in daycare!    Get out there and go for it girl, you can do it!
7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I don't know, I think it is a personal choice.      I have 4 names because I am an idiot and decided to keep my maiden name as a 2nd middle name.  What a pain in the A$%  The problem is that the 2nd middle name is thought of as a first last name instead and causes all sorts of problems.    So as an ending to this story, I would never name my child more than 3 names, first middle last.  But, I don't begrudge those who choose to do so....|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I have 6 names as does my son. Each one has meaning and I have always loved mine. Of course I don't use them all or introduce myself with all of them. People don't use their middle names very often and when I do I just use my first one. But my birth cert and ss card has them all. No, I don't need to sign them on legal documents either. I think it is great to have more than three names why do we all have to have three? Seems silly to limit it if you have reasons to want to pass along more to your child.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	It's a bit ridiculous to be giving a child that many names just to do it. If all the names we're family names I could understand, I know of families who throw fits if their name isn't included when a new child is born.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I like unique or a little different.|`|UgzaDU8vaa	I want to give my kid a lot of names.  Just because I can't decide, haha.  I probably won't, but it's a thought.|`|0LHw7Ve5aa	I totally agree with that  I DO love unusual names, I'm not planning on calling my child John or Paul  However, why do people choose to call their children something like Grace, but spell it Grayse, or people calling their kids Jessica but spelling it Jessykah  It's like they're trying to make out that they're original and upper-class, but they're just ghetto!  And yeah, I think two middle names is okay (as long as they're not like, 3 syllables each), but no more than that|`|44OH7Si6aa	I understand people naming their children with multiple middle names, usually it is a cultural tradition of the family and the child typically only uses one of those middle names in everyday life. I dislike the change of spelling for names, unless you are making it easier to pronounce phonetically and I detest the unique names. Statistically your child is less likely to get even a call back on their resume with unique name rather than a more common name. I hear so many cutesy names that I really get disgusted, the names are great for a two year old but one day your kid is going to be 32 and then it's not so great.|`|IvkNTqDMaa	I DEF agree...what's with the two, three and four middle names??? I also do not like when people insist on naming their child after a city, state, country or borough of NY.|`|3XwxqcADaa	Naming a child has become an opportunity to "one up" the next couple.  Naming children should be a way to preserve a family's names rather than stigmatize the child by naming him or her something like DaKwonda Mushalla (just made this one up), or Sage Moonblood (actual name of Sylvester Stallone's son).     One of the 4 babies born on New Year's Day this year is named Sha-Shaye (first name only).     I think that goes just a little too far to the 'ridiculous' side of child naming.  I'm sorry, that's my opinion.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Yes, I agree.  What's with all the names for one kid?  Is it because they can't decide on one or two?  They need to make them sound like old royalty with a list of names?  And I agree the spelling has gone crazy.  Brian Regan did a skit on it which is pretty funny.  "Look at my name tag -- it's BIG!"
Cmu3WM6kaa	Actually, you could have inherited the trait your father carries from his mother for multiple ovulation. This gene was no use to your father to have twins, but there's the possibility of it being passed to your and your sister.   My mother is a fraternal twin, and my great-grandfather on my mother's maternal side was a fraternal twin (I'm a fraternal twin also), so it would appear that in our family, it passed from my great-grandfather first to my granny.   Of course, you could also carry identical twins, since they happen by chance.|`|KPKd8dzNaa	Your chances are slim.  It comes from the mothers side.  If your mom was a twin or there are twins on her side.  I have Identical twin boys and there were no twins on either side of mine or my husbands family.  But then again, identicals are not hereditary.    Hope I helped.|`|qSpbB5Dpaa	I have heard it usually skips a generation so in your case you could have twins.|`|Oi3GTByKaa	I think it comes from the mother's side. That could mean that your mom would have to be the twin for you to have higher probability for twins, but I don't know. If you do have twins I guess it would be coming from the mom's side (since you are the mom and your dad is a twin).   Anyway...my husband is a fraternal twin and has two boys (one with me and one from a previous relationship.) I don't think my son or step-son has higher chances of creating twins.  Good question?
Su0O55W8aa	You said it in your question, he does have control and he knows it, even at 8 months old!  Try stretching his time awake out longer so he will get sleep.  Wake him up at the time you want his schedule to begin with and keep him awake.  Be sure not to let him take late naps, this is causing him to fight going to bed at night.  Sometimes you do need to let them cry themselves to sleep because at this point he is crying to get his way and knowing you are going to come and get him up.  Babies are a lot smarter than people give them credit for!  Don't let him cry himself to sleep EVERY time though, its not healthy and can seem like neglect.  Make sure the room is dark and have some soothing music playing.  Even if you have to put him in the swings that you can set on a timer to swing(rock) him to sleep!  Whatever works best during this trial and error time.  A bath right before bed time is also helpful!    Here are some suggestions:  http://www.ehow.com/how_11435_baby-sleep...    http://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-b...    http://www.babydevelopmentnews.com/babys...|`|AA10167940	Whatever you do, lease don't let your baby "cry it out"-    Try putting him down earlier, like at 7:30-8.  I don't really keep my 8 month old on a schedule, but we do have a routine and especially a bedtime routine.  At 6:30-7pm, we do a solid hour of play followed by a lavender bath and a good nurse.  She is sound asleep by 8:30-9 and will sleep a good 6 hours before waking up for a feed-|`|5YPSyP91aa	ours is 2yrs and he is tough to get to sleep and stay on schedule... dont feel you have to have such structure for a baby that small... he will evolve over the months, wont always be like that...     one recommendation is to have formula or breast ready to go for when he wakes, act quickly, and it will soothe him back to sleep...|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Why are you trying to keep an 8 month old on a structured schedule?  That sets you up for a pretty horrible battle for control that your baby will win.      Have you considered that your baby's needs have changed since you established your schedule?  Maybe he doesn't need as much sleep as before.  Maybe because he is now more active he needs his sleep at different times than before.  Maybe he's realizing that a schedule that never worked well for him in the past is now something he can do something about instead of helplessly going along.    Remember, your 8 month old won't "have a lot of control" if you don't make it a battle for control.  You set up the guidelines and the limits, but you have to let him work inside of those limits.      Right now, where it is very possible that your baby's needs are changing and have changed, maybe you can try setting some general "schedules".  Maybe try something like "two naps a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon", then watch his cues to see when he tells you those times should be.  Before he may have needed a nap after breakfast, but now that he is bigger, more active, and more alert, he may not need that nap until just before lunch.  Rework your schedule (schedules are awful for babies, but I'm guessing you need a schedule) so that it accommodates your baby and not so that your baby is accommodating the schedule.    Sure, you could let him cry it out, as long as you want  to teach your baby that you don't care about his needs, you're too lazy to help him deal with his emotions, and you're too heartless to respond to his cries.  Cry-it-out also works really well when you want to teach your child that you're the boss and whatever you say goes, even if it isn't in the best interest for your child.  In essence, if you want to teach your baby "I say it's bedtime so you cry and scream and tell me you aren't tired as much as you want, I'm not going to take care of you because I'm Mom and I'm right", you can let him cry it out.  This is a very effective way to teach your baby that he can't trust you and depend on you.|`|Gc1bznpTaa	Please try - 'The Contented Little Baby' by Gina Ford.    Although not all of her methods worked and the controlled crying was too harsh for my liking, there are some great things to try and they worked fantastically for me.  I know every baby is different but try and get the book if you can - it might just work for you.|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	If you had a schedule that he was on and now he doen't seem to watn to follow it then you need to adjust it. He may not be tired and want to play longer before he naps.   Don't make a big deal out it when he fights you. Just walk out of the room if you hesitate at all, he will sense it. I don't agree with people who think that letting your baby cry it out is a horrible thing to do. Like someone said earlier, babies are a lot smarter than we thin and they will cry and cry and if you keep giving in, that teaches them that the longer they cry, eventually you will come and get them. I started letting my baby cry it around 3 months of age. I wuoldn't let him go for longer than about 10 minutes and then I wuold either go get him and rock him or eventually you can tell when they start getting tired and thee crying gets softer. When the crying gets softer, they are giving up and this will teach then that crying is not always going to get their way. Obviously there are ways to tell when you should go in and comfort them, and there is a fine line beteween showing them that you are setting boundaries and just being neglectful. There is also a method where you can go in the room every few minutes to let them know that you are there and you hear them, but do not say anything and don't act like you are going to pick them up, just let them know you are there and then walk out again. I think it's called the Ferber method. But the longer you go without nipping this in the bud, the harder it will be to break the habit. As far as waking after bedtime, make sure he has a full belly right before bed (baby food and a bottle) and don't give him any naps at least 2-3 hours prior to bedtime. You may want to gt into a bedtime routime of a bath and a story to let him know that bedtime is near. Good Luck  and be strong. Letting them cry it out does NOT mean you are a bad mother.|`|VGmZ1gmuaa	Im in the same boat But when my almost 2 year old archs his back and fights me. I still sitting there and dont let him go because he will learn soon or later that its not working! When my child was 8 months old i asked the doctor what i should do he said that will not hurt them to lay in the bed and cry themselves to sleep. The only different that im having is i put mine to bed at 8:30 and than he sleeps until around 12 and gets up and comes to my bed and gos right back to sleep, I dont understand that! Im pregnant so it gets to where you dont have enough room to lay and get enough sleep! I have to find something to do that works
G2auAv1Saa	I would definitely start him sleeping in his own bed. You may have to let him cry it out (its painful I know but is worth it). You just moving is a good time for him to start because he is in a new place he needs to get comfortable with and he will come to see that the new house means his own bed.-- Good luck     Him waking up to nurse, I am not sure about that. Every child is different, my daughter quit waking up to eat when she was about 3 months old. I would ask the doctor if he should be getting up that much.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	let him nurse|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	As a parent of two children who didn't sleep through the night until they were 3 years old- you have my sympathy.  I remeber the longing for just one night's sleep.  Jodi Mindell has an excellent book on sleep patterns and issues.  For me that was a lifesaver.  She gives lots of different approaches to sleep issues and never makew judgements.    For me I went to my babies when they cried for me.  They cry because they need you and it is habit.  I don't feel the need to make them conform to my sleep needs.    With out first child we just met his needs when he needed somethiung.  He was also a sleep walker so sleeping through the night didn't happen til he was 5. We found the mindell book when our daughter was 2 and it was a lifesaver.  She didn't always sleep through the night but bedtimes were easier and getting her back to sleep was easier.  I can't remember the name of the approach we used from Dr. Mindell's book but basically It involved having a set bedtime routine every night.  Tucking them in and telling them goodnight and coming back to check on them during different intervals of crying.  I NEVER let the baby cry more than about 7 minutes.  Basically the technique lets them cry it out a bit at bedtime without making them too upset.  (did I mention my kids have terrific gag reflexes so crying it out for too long was impossible as they would invariable throw up- ah the joys of mother hood!)  Once the child is alseep if he calls for you in the night go to him.  Meet his needs and settle him down.  Eventually the child will separate the sleep issue from the needing his mommy issue.  It really worked well for us.  Our children go to bed with no problems and when they do wake up they have the skills to help them get back to sleep.      I wish you the best of luck as it is so hard to be sleep deprived.  One day he'll sleep through the night and you'll eventually forget how hard it was, until one day he'll have alittle one of his own that will keep HIM up all night.|`|5gIgsAxdaa	I agree with Mrs. Herrera.  Definitely should get him into his own room.  As far as him waking up too often not sure how passionate you are about nursing, but we supplemented our kids with formula, especially the last feeding and that seemed to help them sleep a little longer.
FP8Avd3oaa	I wouldn't leave it in there more than ONE day!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, for the common formulas, you can make up 24hrs worth and put in fridge; specialty and others i don't know, but it should say on the can...we always make a day's worth every night and use it all day the next day...much easier that way...|`|pXSKSS3daa	Pre-made, unused, formula can be kept in the fridge for up to 24 hours.     Any bottle that your baby has drank out of needs to be used within that hour. Any formula left over needs to be discarded after that hour.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	You are supposed to make up every bottle when you need it. But I know people who make one big batch and keep it in their fridge and just take it out when they need it. You arent supposed to do it but I suppose you could. Just make sure you throw out any formula that is over 24 hours old. I make my son's bottles up when I need them. It doesnt take any time at all and I would rather it be fresh.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Most formula canisters will mention that formula, as long as it hasn't been drank from, will stay good in the fridge for up to 24 hours.|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Yes you can keep it up to 24 hours|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Prepared formula can be kept in the fridge for up to 24 hours.|`|60a7e3ffd573059c61c0954b767554aaaa	no, toss it after an hour|`|kvHGjd1Raa	It depends.  If it's left over in the bottle your not suppose to.  But I have done it before just because I didn't want to waste a whole bottle.  Usually I pour it out.  Just don't use it after 24 hours.
XPnCeJ29aa	OKay, sorry Im going to sound stupid, but does defiant mean..like a child who goes against you?  Well if it does then I think that if the parent is a pushover, then yes.  If the parent is sensitive in the sense that they can empathize with their children and understand where they are coming from, then no, I believe that teaches the child self confidence and affirms their feelings are normal. And they will then have a closer bond. I believe parents and children need to know where the other one comes from..I dont mean the parent needs to bow down to their child and explain every little decision they make, I feel that the parent and child relationship should be one with alot of communication.    If the parent is sensitive in the sense that they cry when their child doesnt listen to them, or behaves badly..then tht will be a big mess, and yes the child will turn out to be defiant.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I would say yes. I've had a few relatives that made this mistake. It's good to beloving and nurturing, but there has to be some form of discipline too. If there isn't, a child will learn VERY quickly that they can walk over you and get away with anything they want. Once they figure that out, it's going to start getting tough.|`|cteyFJxhaa	There's nothing wrong with being sensitive as long as you can put your foot down when needed.    There's a time and place for everything.    My step-son ended up in the hospital with infection from a fish hook/ finger accident that everyone was too "sensitive" to clean properly.  No one wanted to make him cry.  When he got home I threw a screaming fit at his aunt (who he was on holidays with) and asked her how much she thought he'd cry if he lost the damn finger!!!???   It was swollen to at least 3 times it's normal size!    As for defiant, if a kid knows you're capable of putting your foot down then they will not defy you.  I they know they can get away with it they will.|`|AA11217207	My mother was and still is very sensitive to my needs. I could tell her anything I needed to and I knew I had her support. However she is my mother not my friend.    Being in touch with your child does not need to undermine your authority. Based on what  I have seen it's best to make rules that are reasonable and unbreakable. You undermine your actions when you create rules without reason and when you let your child get away with breaking the rules you make. You don't have to be a pushover to enjoy a close bond with your child.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	What does 'being a sensitive parent' mean?|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Children land on this planet with their own personalities, no matter what mom & dad are like. You can be kind with one child, and it works, but not another. Or U can be too strict and turn out a defiant child. I made my share of mistakes. U do not say what prompted this question. If U R a sensitive parent, then U try not to hurt the child's feelings while still being the leader. That is key -- U have to be the leader. One thing I always did was to admit that I might have made a mistake if an injustice was done. Sometimes U accidentally punish the wrong child for something. When this occurs apologize. Fairness is important.|`|dp7VR8BJaa	I wouldn't confuse sensitive with being a "friend" to your child.  Being sensitive means you understand that you may need to "talk" to your child, not just punish them, when they do something wrong.  I don't think this means you are a doormat by nature because of this.|`|prqrQcd1aa	For her own child, the trauma may be less, but still significant. Kids who have to deal with such erratic, frightening parents may never form the secure attachment that allows healthier children to cope with the stresses of life. They're more likely than average to suffer emotional and behavioral problems throughout their youth, and they're apt, if Jacobvitz and Hazen-Swann are right, to pass some form of their troubles on to their own kids.....     My mother went through something like this and did pass some form of her own troubles on to me. I did suffer from depression through most of my teenage years, but when i was about 20 i learned to cope with it, and figured out why i thought the way i thought and why i acted the way i did about certain things, it all came down to how my mother treated me, and how i was allowed to be treated by father figures around me!     "Parenting is important," says Hazen-Swann, "even over the long term. People will say that they're not going to be like their own parents, but when you observe them, it turns out that in important ways they often are, especially when they don't have that much insight into how their childhood affected them. They'll repeat the same patterns, or the patterns will reappear in different forms."    This is NOT TRUE( with me atleast) but it is true with my mother i would have to say.., i have seen so many parents my age go through the same things that i went through, and they actually do not do this. I have a child that is bipolar/adhd, my mother has a child almost identical to my daughter... her uncle, while i got my child the help that she needed at a young age and knew that it had nothing to do with my parenting skills or lack thereof, she did not and now my brother has suffered because of it....I have a lot of insight into how my child hood affected me, more than my mother will even care to admit, and i have changed the cycle of abuse that started with my grandmother! I would say if people that were in situations like this basicly "disected" their own minds they would learn from the mistakes of their parents, and would end the cycle of abuse, most people are now able to do this with out any feeling of guilt now days. Going to a councelor or psycologist 20 years ago, even 10 years ago was considered a taboo, now it is not. Where do they mention in here that there are so many parents that have sought help in order to stop these cycles of abuse that it is possible to stop it???   In shor the answer to your question is this... it depends on the ability of the mother to actually know how she was or was not affected in her child hood to stop the cycle of abuse and end up with a child that is not defiant. Not the mention the fact that a LOT of parents that WERE abused as kids there is some sort of mental illness that is usually at the root of it all, that or the loss of the ability to be emotional...and there is a mental illness that covers people who can not feel emotions too!|`|AA11481889	I don't know about "Depressed" or "Sensitive" ...but I know that being a push over will result in defiant children.      I'm sensitive to my son, and I tend to his needs but I also know when I'm being played...    I think the difference is when the mothers allow themselves to be played because they think they'll hurt or scar their child if they actually stand up to them...and that's just silly.    I have a friend here at work that lets her kid get away with murder and on the few occasions that he gets so out of control that she snaps and actually says something to him...he has a meltdown, and then she cries for half the day here at work because she upset him...It's ridiculous.    He's 6 and she's 40 and he can manipulate her like the best of them and she thinks that it's normal and ok...and it's not, in my humble opinion.    It's like anything else...moderation is key.  You can't be a control freak and totally suppress the child normal developmental behaviors, but you also can't stand by the wayside and allow your child to walk all over you.      I think that a certain measure of self expression is normal and acting out is normal....but there's a line were it becomes a dysfunction...and it's our jobs to make sure that we're within the "normal" boundaries of child development and parenting...|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.I believe it depends on the actual parenting and the child.
264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Try your best to coordinate nap time around that time.  Try a portable dvd player with a new or favorite movie.  You can sit by a window with lots of action and let her just watch what's going on and watch the planes take off and land.  Maybe coloring books, and toys that are on the quiet side so you don't "annoy" anyone :)  5 hours is a long time, just try to keep her as busy as you can.  I don't know if this would work, but maybe get a sucker and have her sit in your lap and take licks, that could take forever to finish..just make sure she doesn't bite it.  I know the sugar's probably a bad idea, but you gotta do what you gotta do to keep her quiet and entertained.  I have a 1 year old and we've flown across the country twice now, never had a 5 hour lay over, but we had a 2 hour one.  Just take your time getting from place to place and stop to look in shops and show her new and interesting things in the airport :)  Good Luck!|`|Nti8czLvaa	Take walks.  When we were in the airport not to long ago, my 5 year olds, and my 2 year old niece had a blast going up and down the escalator, and the stairs right next to it.  Yeah I got tired of it fast, but as long as they weren't  grumpy, bored, and all over the place, I was happy with whatever was keeping them entertained.|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	I'd be going for lots of long walks around the terminal. Explore everything there is to explore- the chapel, the escalators, all the vendors.  Get lots of drinks from the water fountain, look out the windows at the planes.  If it's a big airport with a tram system, have fun riding it.    If you wear her out enough, she might take a nap.  Bonus!|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	Take a few toys out at a time.  Take a walk.  Play peekaboo.  Try to put her down for a nap.  Get something to eat.Read her a book.
Bw1h5xAcaa	If the contractions are coming pretty regularly, 5 minutes apart from the start of one to the start of the next, if each contraction itself lasts longer than 45-50 seconds, if it has been going on for more than one hour, and they are steadily getting more painful, closer together, longer in duration, if they don't slow down when you hydrate yourself and lie on your left side, and if walking makes them feel more intense, then you should probably head to the hospital.     If you are ever not really sure, call your doctor before going to the hospital, sometimes talking to them over the phone can save you a false alarm run.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Some people say that you will know when you are in labor but if they don't hurt that much and they are still coming about every 10 min or so, I would still go to the hospital just in case. You could be one of the lucky ones that contractions dont hurt!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	false contraction dont really hurt they just feel like someone is giving you a big bear hug around your belly. real ones feel the same way but come ever 10 or so mins and get stronger as they keep coming. they eventually start to hurt. if you think your having contractions call your doctor your to early to go into labor.

UsqZhtdKaa	I've always considered myself pro-choice, I strongly believe in women's reproductive rights, having worked with victims of rape and incest I understand why women choose to have abortions.  However, since I've started ttc I have found myself to be more sensitive to the issue of abortion, as I really want a child.  I think that different situations challenge our beliefs and what we think is right and wrong, that's part of life.|`|n1vKoto7aa	I've always wondered about this, too. The answers should be interesting to read.

oP504BtFaa	As another mom said, I'm as involved as my daughters allow me to be, however how much they allow me to be involved just goes back to the fact that I have always worked towards an honest, trusting, open relationship with my girls.    I have no problem with them having 'boyfriends'. My daughters are almost 14, I think one of them had a boyfriend at 11, but really at 11 a boyfriend is someone to go out to an ice cream parlor with...with his mom or me! Now that they are a little older, I'll drive them to the movies in the afternoon with a group of friends while I stick around the town center until the movie gets out. My girls know that I'm much more lenient with what they do if they're honest, and they trust me enough to be honest with me, while I trust them enough to know that they're being honest - that's a mouthful!    They chatter with each other often while I'm in the room so I'll overhear, or they'll chatter directly to me, about who's cute and who likes who and all of that and I think it's fine. I don't want to suffocate my girls, as boys and crushes are one of the most natural things in life! We're still in middle school, though, so I'm crossing my fingers that high school WILL NOT bring negative boy trouble...if it starts interfering with their attitudes or grades, that's when I have to take a step back and think "Now what could I have done better?" and if that point comes, we'll still simply talk it through and come to a solution.    What about you, Carrie?|`|jdRKZe18aa	I think the MORE involved a parent is the better - within reason of course.  For example: when my daughter had a 16 yr birthday party at our home one summer, she had probably 30+ kids there. I knew only a hand full of them. I went out in the yard through out the evening to just check out the 'crowd' and ensure all was well - spoke to a few, said Hi - shook a couple of hands - turned down the blaring music a little but didn't LINGER so that she could just enjoy her friends without MOM being unreasonably involved in HER party.  I WAS however saddened and amazed that there was only ONE PARENT who came to our door from ALL of those who attended to check and see if parents were home for this party, what kind of party it was, meet us, see our home NOTHING!  That shocked me!  THAT is not involved enough in my estimation.    First my kids don't date til 16 and then I try to encourage double dating for obvious reasons.  Second, I ALWAYS insist on meeting any friends or b/f or g/f, get names - talk to them a little get DETAILS about times, places, events, activities and GIVE specifics for TIME EXPECTED HOME.  I don't try to be these kids friends - but I try to be a friendly parental presence in ALL their relationships.  (as well as their school things, teachers, etc)    A parent can always cut BACK on their involvement - but if not ENOUGH is happening there COULD be potential problems and issues that aren't seen or recognized until it is too late.  ONCE they are old enough and have earned trust and shown their maturity etc - my involvement is FAR LESS necessary.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	As involved as they need to be, to make sure that their particular child is being safe, healthy, kind, smart.  That's going to be different with every child and will probably change as the teen matures, and as new situations come up.      I'm not sure how I would define 'involved'.  That could range quite a bit - from meeting the teen's friends - to chaperoning - to not allowing the child to spend time with particular friends, depending on the family and the child.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Seems like a fairly simple question, but it is not.  Nor is the answer.    In my mind, there is no excuse for parents (usually the Mom) to be in any way NOT involved.  As a parent, it is your responsibility to know where he/she is, with whom, and what may or may not be happening.  Having said that, of course I don't believe you can control what a teen does when you are not around.  However, if you have raised them with a serious sense of values and morals, you can be fairly sure what he is doing.    As I see it, one of the big problems with parent/teen relationships is the fact that in so very many instances, the parents have not been good role models because of their own behaviors. They were parents or nearly so before marriage, they use drugs (yup, even the "recreational" thing counts), and they,often by their actions more than words, teach their children that morals and scruples are no longer "cool".    I am saddened by the fact that almost all parents have heard of "tough love", but so very few practice it.     Parents:  your job is not to be a friend, but to be a parent.  Your kids don't need another "buddy", they need a Mom and a Dad.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	When I was a teen, my parents always knew my boyfriends. Always. I had to bring them over for dinner regularly so my folks could talk to them. They weren't intrusive, they just enjoyed having conversations with young people. Especially my mother - she's one of those types who all the kids in the neighborhood would flock to.     So while I hated my parents wanting my boyfriends around at the time, I appreciate it now and plan to do the same when my son starts dating.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Involved = controlling the parameters of the relationship within a certain age range    I wasn't allowed to date (go alone with a guy somewhere) until I was 16 and never to his house, unless it was a family celebration, otherwise only public places dates    Even then it was "where are you going? What will you be doing? When will you be back?" If I wasn't home within 5 minutes of the projected time, the cell phone would ring off the hook.    Around the end of 16 nearing 17 they gave up and it was a free for all|`|AXEqOEloaa	I have an almost 17 year old and I am as involved as he will let me be. I have always been open about sex with him and he does share alot with me but I only know what he tells me. He knows he can share anything with me.|`|7ZsvzIP7aa	That depends on the age of the teenager. I think parents should be VERY involved in their child's relationships if the child is a young teen (13-15). I think at that point, it's inappropriate for a child to be on a date alone with the opposite sex, or to have a boyfriend/girlfriend at the house if the parents aren't home. At 16-18, I think the rules need to start loosening up, as far as allowing dating but I still think that as long as the child is living at the parent's home, the parents have the right to know where the teen is and who he/she is with, also to set standards about curfews and places the teen is/is not allowed to go. If the teen wants more freedom than that, the teen needs to be responsible enough to find a job and a place to live. Freedom comes with responsibility, and I think the teen should only be given complete freedom in relationships when they are ready to be an adult.|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Be more specific.  How old?    Under 13: ALL visits should be supervised.  No dating.    14-15: All visits should be supervised.  Parents at least present in house.  No need to cramp anybodies style, but parents need to be vigilant.      16+:  Relax a little.  Keep the lines of communication wide open.      I do like my own mother did.  No boys before 15.  My mother put me on birth control when I was 15.  We talked about EVERYTHING.|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	As involved as they can be.  it is important for kids to be able to talk with their parents.  I have a 13 yr old and even though he isn't sexually active, he know if he thinks he may be he can talk to me or any of the adults in his life. When he does begin dating, I will know the girl and and I will make an effort to know the people he is spending time with.  Parents can't help with kids if they know nothing about them.|`|AA12181625	If they are brought up right you don't have to worry as much.as long as they are aware of the responibilitys they have to maintain and what a burden anything else would be.OF coarse regulating their time ,having a gaurdian or over seer in this is a good thing too.attending it not involed in it is better.other aspects are good grades at school and the things they do.ie;sports. ...|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Well I'm not sure a parent should be involved in the relationship as much as they should be involved in their child's life.  This is how I view dating.  No dating under the age of 16 and boyfriend/girlfriend relationships WILL NOT BE encouraged if my kids are under that age.  If/when my teens are interested in someone of the opposite sex, I will ask questions and draw them out in conversation and give advice, I want my kids to have common sense and use common sense!  I will want to meet their "love" interest and spend time with them, invite them over and get to know them a little bit as well.|`|AA11481889	Um completely and absolutely.    I'm not sure that a teenager should haev a "relationship" with the opposite sex.    I wasn't allowed to go on dates until I was 17 or 18 and my parents knew everything about everybody that I associated with and all the parents knew each other too.    I think kids need to be able to explore and grow up...but just because they're getting to young adulthood...doesn't mean that a parent should be shirking their supervisoral responsibilities.    I think if parents got more involved, we'd have fewer kids having kids.
wHVx9HZVaa	If you are off your rocker then so are most mums I know!  My sister-in-law and I used to ring each other if we were going in the loft...just in case.   She would ring me half an hour later or I would ring her depending who was in the loft.  I had never fallen out of a loft in my life and neither had she but the thought of either of us lying at the bottom of the stairs unconscious with two under twos wondering around helplessly was just too big a chance to take.  Needless to say neither of us ever did fall down but the peace of mind it brought was wonderful.   Now they are grown it is not a problem but how do I stop worrying about my kids when I hear a siren around school/college start/finish time?   I think mothers just worry.|`|UjPArJZ6aa	I'm a single parent and I too have those fears. My son is now five years old and I still wonder 'what if...'|`|uLLQovSyaa	No you're not the only one.I've thought along those lines also.|`|0m9LcnVTaa	No I think the same way as well...LOL I think its just part of being a mom, i always have bad thoughts about something happening to me when my daughter is around and no one being there for her. I hope its normal :)|`|TfPDMDZMaa	I think it just shows that you really care and value your kids. That you know they need your help. I think it's totally normal! =)|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I was put on anxiety medicine after becoming a borderline hypochondriac very shortly after my 1st child was born.  Seriously.    I have moved passed that but I still think about this way too much.  As you said, it's always right there in the back of my mind.|`|AA10811784	You are not alone. I feel that way too. In fact, my biggest fear since becoming a mother is dying and leaving my young children without a mother.    You are right, you can't let it consume you. Not just for your sake, but your children's sake as well.|`|AA10186411	You are not alone lol   I feel the same way!  I also have a fear that I somehow "forgot" that my daughter was in the car and I left her, or I "forgot" to take her to daycare and went on to work and shes in her crib screaming and alone.  lol  Of course, it would be practically impossible to do that, but I still think about it!|`|jnG8sOzWaa	is it normal ? no  does that mean you're crazy ? not necessarily|`|gdbeVf32aa	yes but im only 12 so it might be different but my dad left for work a place 5 hours away and hes gone for 5 months and the thought of him dying or never coming back like just like dissapering in the night constantly keeps me up at night i almost make myself cry with the though...srry but back to you and your problem...its normal everyone thinks that way take me for example! i hope your husband comes back saftly to you and your kids...good luck!|`|vKYdV5r2aa	you are not Crazy , the same thought has crossed my mind many times ! Well maybe not the nursing part , but yes i think it is every parents fear|`|xnhwmontaa	im the same way.. i also have to check the car seats a million times to make sure i dropped them off at daycare..... i think its the stories on the news about things like that, and they stay in our minds.....|`|gxL9qeTyaa	No your not crazy..I think once you become a mother you really do worry about what will happen to your children if something happened to you..I always worry what will happen to my kids and where they will go...so I just tell my self that i know I will be fine cause my kids need me...|`|M4nXH7DTaa	no i think its normal.. my mom had that too. she just made sure she talked to my aunt or someone to make sure if something happned that they would help.. it eased her concions.|`|mO7FOXNYaa	I have that fear, too!    Mainly b/c my boyfriend works in the oil field and is "offshore" for two weeks at a time.    I actually had that thought a few nights ago.   ...what calmed me is that my 6 year old knows how to use my phone and call 911. He also knows our address (I quiz him often!).    I'm not sure how old your little ones are - but if one is 4 years old or older - start training him/her on how to use the phone and memorizing your address.     Maybe talk to a close family member and ask them to do a daily check. Call or something. If you don't answer or call back within an hour - maybe there should be some plan in place to make sure all is ok with you and your family.    *It's better to be "paranoid" than to not care at all.|`|sEUnAmv6aa	your shot|`|sVdQSMvJaa	It's normal and honestly I think if we parents, moms especially were to share all of our fears about our kids it'd really shock us how very much alike we all are.
Xn9ELUeXaa	No you can get pregnant without the penis entering the vagina or only by artficial insemination.    When sperm exits the body, it usually dies very quicky.       Btw. It is very healthy for men to pee after sexual intercourse as it helps prevent prostate cancer.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	No|`|AyEkA6Flaa	She could not get pregnant from those things at all, unless immediately after the hand job she rubbed her hand into her vagina -- which I don't think is very likely!    Typically speaking, the penis has to go into the vagina in order for pregnancy to occur.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	No :)|`|0SIhrYCbaa	absolutely.   for sure.|`|h5e62x6Kaa	Nope. That's impossible unless they had sex, as in, he's penetrating her.|`|o9cAl8xhaa	No- it is virtually impossible to get pregnant based on the series of acts you describe.|`|JwDWwgIcaa	nope :D
bDDGGVGHaa	play dress up and give her complements. she will like you then. and then play on fun brain. best of luck i had the same problem with a drama queen spoiled brat.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	take her to your room, and you guys play dress up and make believe with your clothes, make-up, whatever you have available, she will love it and you will be out of dads hair so he can sleep.  :0)|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Play dress up with full make up.

Good luck!|`|BypjotRpaa	coloring, build a fort, dress up, dolls....|`|9iphkDSTaa	How about you do a beauty queen thing with her? Like paint her nails and do her hair.
joPJtKemaa	i thought the same way, I did not want to be an annoying patient but they are understanding.    Sharp pain usually means your uterus is expanding, but I would still call the doctor just to make sure.  You'd rather be one annoying patient and know that everything is going well in your pregnancy than not knowing what going on.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	i would go to your doc for best results~!|`|ryvO8DMaaa	While I don't recall having that particular pain.....I do remember that there were pains that scared me too.  I honestly can't tell you what I think it is.  I would call the doctor.  You are paying this person very good money to take care of you and your unborn child......it's your right to call them for whatever reason.
4gZYucHMaa	I had his books, I took what I wanted to learn from it and applied it with my kids, it was a good resource book.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	yes absolutely.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	yes but hes a little old school still hes an excellent resource|`|xIowgWL7aa	I thought Sears was a little too new agey (if that is a word) for me and I prefered more traditional parenting choices. He was into wearing the baby in a sling, co-sleeping and options that I didn't want to get into.    I never really followed any of the experts and my kids turned out very well (they are now almost 19 and 16). I call my method the "fly by the seat of your pants" school of parenting. In the heat of the moment, you usually forget what Dr. So and So said and do what your parents would have done (within reason, of course).|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Isn't he the one who wrote all these books on parenting and then did a 180degree turn around after YEARS of doling out one type of advice he completely changed his tune????    I suppose it's like any advice, you read it and decide if it works for you and your parenting style and morals and ethics.  And like anything else, if you try it and it's not working, try something else! LOL|`|DDFSITiYaa	It depends on your own views of parenting.  I do not totally agree with his attachment parenting approach but many people do.  It is just dependant on what type of parent you are.  I'd say to explore a lot of books to figure out what makes sense for you.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I've found a lot of great ideas & inspiration in the writings of Dr Sears.      In the end, of course, you'll have to read it yourself, if you want to know if the ideas fit within your philosophy of living & parenting.
7C9Ett7Caa	It takes like 6-8 weeks. Congrats on your new baby!!|`|h17G3paiaa	totally normal- my first child was a little over 6 weeks before it came|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Give it another week or two to come.|`|PnZigfgHaa	Congrats on your new arrival.    My sister has her baby in July and her periods still haven't come back.  It's connected to hormones and breast feeding.    Hope you get some sleep soon x
F2JEvYX7aa	it should not hurt when you pee, call your doctor right away.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	sounds like  u have a UTI as well so you need to see the doctor  2 weeks is a long time to leave it id be down there the 1st appointment i could get    dont suffer any longer x x x|`|RjoCYCkQaa	Sounds like there is bread in the oven and by the smell of it its sourdough.  One time it burned when i peed, i went to the walk in clinic, took a couple pills, and got a shot in my but. Then it didnt burn anymore.|`|h17G3paiaa	You need to see your dr right away, it sounds like you may have a bladder infection|`|g7bToAzCaa	Go to the doctor please!!!    (Will you please answer my most recent question ''Why is it every time I think of him I get really nervous.?'', thanks i would appreciate it)|`|AA12150577	You could have a bad bad bladder infection and yes it hurts when you pee i am working on getting over it now worse pain ever and for as the blood i dont no unless its just that bad and you can cramps if that is what it is you need to get checked cause it can lead into kidney problems.    Symptoms  There are a number of symptoms associated with UTIs. Bladder infections are characterized by an urgent desire to empty the bladder. Symptoms include frequent urination, burning or pain during urination (dysuria), bladder spasms and the feeling of having to urinate even though little or no urine actually comes out. In some cases, cloudy, bloody or foul-smelling urine, and maybe a mild fever can accompany a UTI.    A kidney infection may involve more serious symptoms, including fever, chills, and nausea. There may also be cloudy or bloody urine, abdominal pain and frequent urination. Most people with kidney infections also experience back pain just above the waist.|`|AA11223036	you rmore than likely have a urinary tract infection which can make you go into early labor i would call the doctor right away and make an appt. some amoxicillin should clear it right up
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I think every Mom has those moments. I know I did. I just put my son in the crib, and walked away lied down for a minute or 2. Sometimes we need a time out ourselves.     Yes puppies and babies are different but puppies can be a handful too. My sister in law has 2 puggles (pug mixed with beagles) and they are crazy! I would rather take care of my son any day then take care of those 2 untrained puppies!|`|zwctZ812aa	My son was very colicky as a newborn and there were times when I felt like that.  It was so hard when he would just scream and scream and scream and there was nothing I could do.  When I felt myself getting frustrated I would call a good friend or someone in the family, or call his daddy if he wasn't home and just admit that I was at my wits end and I needed help.  Someone was always willing to come over and give me a hand. I never felt like I would hurt him or anything, so I never just sat him down and walked away, but if it ever would have gotten to that point I would have.  That's the best thing to do.|`|oyWSVmdwaa	I have loads of sex!|`|yUyx2nhmaa	it's normal. just put them somewhere safe for five minutes while you go and take some deep breaths.|`|wQSsw8QHaa	just like u said walk away for a minute until you com down|`|Run7dyraaa	Yes, but you need to learn how to control it. It's only a puppy. You need more patience. If you get frustrated with a dog, imagine how you would be with a baby. I'd really work on that.  If you feel yourself getting out of control, yes, definitely walk away. Do not take it out on a helpless puppy.  That would be very cruel.|`|cDoZM7vWaa	I think people should plan before they have kids, but, unforutanetly, most don't.  People need to plan to see if they want to take care of a child, and they also need to think to themselves "is it worth it if my child is born retarded?" or something.  At this point, I would not have kids because I am thinking of all of the possible consequences.  Plus, the population of the earth is soaring.  I heard that by 2015 the earth will have 12 billion people.  If I ever "have" a kid, I would adopt them.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	Yes, every mother gets that way.  Sometimes that is exactly what you have to do.  Its the only way a mother can cope sometimes.  Its hard to do sometimes because you feel bad that your child is crying but when you have tried everything you can think of to help him or her and you feel like pulling your hair then you need to step away for a minute or two.  Its for your sanity.  Sometimes stepping away can help you to figure out what is needed in a situation also.|`|zn6OVTJHaa	I definitely feel like that sometimes with my son!    The way I rationalize it, is that its better to leave them alone for a minute or two, than do something horrible to them out of sheer frustration. Even yelling at them is horrible. Instead, a small break where you can take a deep breath and calm down, is a sensible way to approach a frustrating situation.|`|7b9950c99c6ea90a89b5e6b29c014f81aa	A baby will frustrated you 10x more then a puppy sometimes. When I get very upset I just put him in his crib and most of the time he gets happy. If im upset that makes him cry or scream. When I get away and leave him in the crib he relaxes and becomes happy. Also before I had my baby my puppy would  frustrate me and what I would do is lock him or leave him somewhere out of my sight.|`|Grb85RJuaa	You cannot get mad at puppy unless you have no soul.|`|5BBy6G36aa	When I had my baby, I ate it. =(  Sad sad day...|`|NTLczlmXaa	it's different because a puppy can survive by itself for a little while but a baby can't. they sleep a lot..u learn to take your breaks then.|`|JjbragXNaa	You walk away for a few minutes.  It's completely normal to have brief feelings of frustration and even violence (I read that in my baby book!) towards your child (or puppy?), and when you do, walk away, as long as the baby (or puppy) is safe.  When you want to worry is when those feelings of frustration won't go away or you actually act on them.|`|ej8WdojXaa	They probably want to adventure out and look at everything and see the world|`|vm5TgsQwaa	My friend did just recently have a baby and she says she gets so frustrated that she puts her baby in the highchair or hands him to her husband and just leaves the room and yells. It is common.|`|mWukMOAeaa	When it gets really bad get a pooch sitter. Honestly, go out or something. I raised six kids. You need a breather, baby or puppy ; )|`|NmsBFeNJaa	Yes, believe me, a puppy and a baby are 2 very different levels of frustration. Honestly, if a puppy upsets you that much then I don't want to see what happens when you have spent several months with little or no sleep and have a baby constantly crying when you've done everything you can think of to get them to stop. Once I was so upset that I left my crying baby in his crib, went outside, and just screamed. I can only imagine what the neighbors thought. I have raised several puppies and one baby(one more on the way) and the two really can't be compared at all.|`|gsgjpYWtaa	im 15 and have a baby brother  nah my mum never gets mad at him but i do! i hate babys so much im never having one. i think when you become a mum you get some dodgie hormones that make you care about your baby sooo much    reasons not to have a baby: my baby brother did a projectile **** on my face while my mum was changing him it also made a big mess of the room  they spill drinks they cry and CRY they are the worst thing in the world he was left with a nappy off for a while while my mum went and bought some and he took a big steaming dump on the floor -.- they keep u up for several night in a row they are worse than you could ever imagine|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Ryan, you need to realize that what you just said is dumb. No matter how much you prepare for a baby, you are NEVER truly ready or prepared. I knew everything I was getting into when we started trying and I STILL have had like 2 moments when she wouldn't stop screaming where I had to buckle her in her swing, and walk in the other room and cry for about 5 minutes. Then I was calm enough to go back, pick her up, and start over again to try to soothe her. And if my hubby's home I give her to him and take a breather. Anyway, a puppy is completely different. Get one of those carrier things and stick him in it for a little while. I hate dogs though, so I'd stick him outside.|`|wOyyZjY0aa	Oh Honey.... yes even as a parent there will be times you feel that way.  Thinking back to when my daughter was alot smaller..... she has alot of acid reflux = a ton of crying.  It was very difficult.  I never really got to the point where I wanted to just run away, but there were times when I had to put her in the swing for 2 minutes and sit down and take a breath.    As a parent, there are times when you feel alittle overwhelmed.  However usually after a 1-2 minute break everything turns around.  Now with my daughter I could not just set her down for long.....I mean she was uncomfortable with the reflux.   So more than anything I felt bad for her.   You will be surprised at how parenting really is when you become a mom.  It's not a easy or stress-free job.....but you will be just fine.  There are times when you feel like you've had enough....but like I said even a 30 second break does miracles.  Best of luck in the future!!!|`|72SrLDQ3aa	There are times I feel like that, and when it happens I put my baby down and walk away so I can cool down, and then I go back much calmer and can handle the situation better.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	you just have to walk away after putting them in a safe place for a min and cool down and then start again..|`|hwIMJBVpaa	i really didnt get very frustrated, you kinda learn to ignore things when you have a baby. my son cried constantly for the first 2 months and if i knew there was nothing wrong with him and he didnt need anything i would just ignore it and he would eventually stop. i know that might sound mean, but what else can you do?|`|AA10390690	there are times i put my daughter in her pack and play, give her a bottle or pacifier and her blankets and i leave and shut the door and 9/10x she will fall asleep. otherwise i will hand her over to my boyfriend or my parents. it's not a bad thing. sometimes parents just reach their limits and just need a small break. i usually just go outside for a quick breath of fresh air or do something i need to do and go back to her once i'm calmed.

CuCrGDuRaa	My doctor told me that during the first trimester all babies develop at the same rate.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Not exactly the same, but it is much more uniform growth in those early weeks than in later ones.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Yes, there is an average growth rate for babies... it's charted somewhere... not all grow at the SAME rate, but there's definately a close average you can follow... search "My pregnancy __ weeks" Good luck!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Yes, they're pretty much all the same until week 13-14 where some will grow faster and others slower based on genetics.    I'm not sure about the rate, most resources reference the baby's size comparatively against fruits.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	All babies are different. I'm sure it's pretty close but I don't think every baby is the same size at any stage of the pregnancy. I may be wrong though!
QB5D0rG4aa	A man's sperm can live within a females reproductive tract beyond the cervix for up to five days given the correct conditions within the environment. Sperm will only live up to a few hours if its within the vagina or outside the human body due to the exposed air. Once the sperm dries its life has ended. Sperm is nourished with seminal fluids which protect and allow the sperm to swim. The seminal fluids allow the sperm to swim within the females reproductive tract to ultimately fertilize the egg. Once fertilized it is said to be a living embryo.   The egg on the other hand has a lifespan of 24 hours. Sperm that has been deposited within 5 days can still fertilize the egg during ovulation. Hope this helps.|`|7DWy8mPZaa	Sperm can survive in your reproductive tract for up to seven days, but this is really the very longest! The average is 2-3 days, even less so if you aren't experiencing any/ much fertile cervical mucus (watery or egg-white in consistency). I find pre-seed excellent as I don't produce much EWCM, if any some cycles! It is said to support the transportation of sperm and help them to survive longer so we start using it as soon as I see a positive OPK.     Assume that sperm will live for 2 days but babydance every day or other day whilst in your window of ovulation. That way, you're doing all you can to try to catch that egg!|`|FSY30gbvaa	My doctor said 3 days.
73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Aaaaah - the independent 2 year old!  I think he's fine as you've described - and chances are once you fall asleep he will too.  If he won't tolerate being in a playpen while you nap (I mean if he's just going to scream and wake up the baby, what's the point....) then I don't see a problem.  If you're like me then once he gets off the bed or anything of that nature you'll probably wake up before he gets into any mischief - sometimes you just need a good 10 or 15 minute power-nap to rejuvenate.  You need sleep with that new baby up during the night, so don't let anyone on here make you feel guilty about it!|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	if you have a play pen to put him in otherwise have him sit on the bed with you while he watches his show. and if you fall asleep he probally will to|`|phyttAf3aa	Chances are you won't fall into a deep sleep anyhow.  You'll hear him if he does anything destructive - and you'll be in the same room.  Like the other person said, if he'll stay in a play pen, that would be ideal, but if not, I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a little cat nap.

VMASMHX6aa	It sounds like your hormones are a bit out of whack. It could be due to having the flu, especially if you had a fever. Such illness can delay or prevent ovulation. Or have you recently come off birth control or stopped breastfeeding? That will also mess up your cycle for a while.    I'd recommend getting some vitex (agnus castus) from the healthfood shop. It's really useful for regulating your cycles in such situations.
rjVALevtaa	You need to go to the doctor as soon as possible. It is not normal for your cervix to be that low. I'm not trying to scare you but the same thing happened to me with my second pregnancy. I went to the hospital and found out I was in the process of having a miscarriage.     I hope that isn't the case for you, good luck.
AA10624857	I think that statistically more first time babies come past their due dates, but it is not a significantly large number.  My first baby was born 9 days past her due date.  She is now a mom herself and my grandson, her first baby, was born exactly on his due date.  My cousin's first baby was born 3 weeks before her due date.  I was my mom's first baby, too, and I was born 2 weeks before my due date.  It isn't really an Old Wives' Tale as there are statistics to support it, but it isn't a large enough number to say that most first babies come past their due date.  It is accurate to say that more babies born past their due dates are born to first time moms.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	40 weeks 6 days with my first when i went into labor and 38 weeks when i went into labor with my second.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	With my first and only, 34 weeks 3 day.

I know this might all sound yucky but it's sooooooo good.  And really easy.  Sometimes I chop up a tomato and lay them on top when it's done.    Serve with a salad or some pasta salad.
IlyS8KGzaa	Myth: Marijuana Interferes With Male and Female Sex Hormones. In both men and women, marijuana can cause infertility. Marijuana retards sexual development in adolescents. It produces feminine characteristics in males and masculine characteristics in females.    Fact: There is no evidence that marijuana causes infertility in men or women. In animal studies, high doses of THC diminish the production of some sex hormones and can impair reproduction. However, most studies of humans have found that marijuana has no impact of sex hormones. In those studies showing an impact, it is modest, temporary, and of no apparent consequence for reproduction. There is no scientific evidence that marijuana delays adolescent sexual development, has feminizing effect on males, or a masculinizing effect on females.

Myth: Marijuana Use During Pregnancy Damages the Fetus. Prenatal marijuana exposure causes birth defects in babies, and, as they grow older, developmental problems. The health and well being of the next generation is threatened by marijuana use by pregnant women.    Fact: Studies of newborns, infants, and children show no consistent physical, developmental, or cognitive deficits related to prenatal marijuana exposure. Marijuana had no reliable impact on birth size, length of gestation, neurological development, or the occurrence of physical abnormalities. The administration of hundreds of tests to older children has revealed only minor differences between offspring of marijuana users and nonusers, and some are positive rather than negative. Two unconfirmed case-control studies identified prenatal marijuana exposure as one of many factors statistically associated with childhood cancer. Given other available evidence, it is highly unlikely that marijuana causes cancer in children.    Mann, Peggy. The Sad Story of Mary Wanna. NY: Woodmere Press, 1988. 30.  Fried, Peter.

Myth: Marijuana Can Cause Permanent Mental Illness. Among adolescents, even occasional marijuana use may cause psychological damage. During intoxication, marijuana users become irrational and often behave erratically.    Fact: There is no convincing scientific evidence that marijuana causes psychological damage or mental illness in either teenagers or adults. Some marijuana users experience psychological distress following marijuana ingestion, which may include feelings of panic, anxiety, and paranoia. Such experiences can be frightening, but the effects are temporary. With very large doses, marijuana can cause temporary toxic psychosis. This occurs rarely, and almost always when marijuana is eaten rather than smoked. Marijuana does not cause profound changes in people's behavior.    Iverson, Leslie.

New England Journal of Medicine 282 (|`|N8rA8AJ1aa	Research studies have shown that women who use recreational drugs during pregnancy tend to use marijuana, thinking that it won't harm the fetus as much as other illegal substances. Although no clear-cut deformity or syndrome is known to occur due to marijuana use during pregnancy (as there is from alcohol use, for example, with fetal alcohol syndrome), there are possible dangers.    First of all, smoking anything during pregnancy deprives the fetus of oxygen. Just as smoking tobacco is discouraged in pregnant women, so is smoking marijuana. Smoking any type of substance interferes with the fetus's blood supply. This can mean the fetus doesn't get enough oxygen, and s/he may be born smaller in both weight and length. Smaller babies have a higher risk of other problems after birth, such as infections, severe jaundice, difficulty feeding, breathing problems, low blood sugar, difficulty regulating temperature, bleeding into the brain, and problems with vision.    Secondly, marijuana is frequently and unpredictably "cut" with other substances. So the fetus may be unintentionally exposed to other potentially harmful substances in addition to marijuana.    Marijuana can also be transmitted through breast milk.  Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC (the main active ingredient in marijuana), can be as much as 8 times higher in breast milk than in the mother's bloodstream.  Babies whose mothers have used marijuana during pregnancy or while breastfeeding sometimes seem jittery and difficult to comfort. They may have some delay in the development of their motor skills, although studies have concluded that this delay may not be permanent.  In any case, it is advisable not to smoke marijuana while breastfeeding.    Since we're on the subject of substance use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, if you already drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, it's in your baby's (and your) best health interests to stop when you are pregnant. During the nursing period, it's commonly recommended that mothers drink only modest amounts of alcohol, delay breastfeeding for 2 - 3 hours after drinking alcohol, and avoid exposing the baby to second-hand smoke.    It should be noted that much of the research on the effects of prenatal exposure to marijuana has been complicated and inconclusive.  This is mainly because it is difficult to isolate the effects of marijuana from other possible factors such as alcohol, other drug use, socioeconomic status, family structure, and mother's personality.  All in all, the healthiest choice for you and your baby is to avoid using recreational chemicals, including marijuana, while pregnant. As difficult as it may be to change one's lifestyle, taking a break from smoking cigarettes and joints, and drinking alcohol and using other drugs, can help set your baby up for a long, healthy life.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	It is the future BABY your selfish drugged out self should be worrying about... that pooooor child.|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	It lowers the sperm count and makes your cycle irregular but I know plenty of people who smoke and get pregnant. I wouldn't recommend it  but that's the truth.|`|Ipq6Bvh3aa	Fetuses are much more susceptible to harm from marijuana and other harmful agents because cells are at their most vulnerable when they reproduce (split).  Accordingly, you should avoid all harmful chemicals when you are trying to get pregnant or you are pregnant.|`|5Bp8vQTTaa	yes, it affects your brain because it kills neurons  and even smoking "normal" cigarettes makes difficult to conceive. Get in a rehabilitation program before try to get pregnant, they will help you to don't destroy yourself and your family.|`|AA11993638	With a man it not only can reduce the sperm count and his ability to ejaculate, but it can also cause deformed sperm, which either have a lower ability to fertilize an egg, but can cause birth defects as well, not just physical ones, but mental defects that may not be noticed until the child is much older. In the woman, it can cause similar problems, such as immature eggs being fertilized. Hence why it is a good idea to stop all toxic substance use several months prior to attempting to conceive, both the male and the female can suffer unknown effects from the use when dealing with fertility and the future of the child they are attempting to conceive.|`|AAbGMKo5aa	When igot pregnant I was smoking marijuana and my boyfriend 2 I was 17 years old my baby is now 5 and he is healthy, cute and smart :]    My sister smoke marijuana all of her pregnancy she has 4 smart cute and healthy kids..    So I don't thing is bad but hey who knows???|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If a couple is trying to conceive you'd think they'd quit all bad substances to give their baby the best chance. What kind of example does it set for your child if you were smoking marijuana when you got pregnant with them?|`|ft8t98Pnaa	Nope... I smoke on a daily basis and I had no problems conceiving. I stopped smoking while I was prego though...  Men on the other hand it reduces their sperm count... but I dont see why it would be a problem... all my friends smoke and they guys have no problems with reproducing...lol.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	for men i was told it reduces the sperm count|`|GcJszsMnaa	Well.....It can mess up..a man's sperm count...sometime....an a woman's fertility....|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It effects both.  The man will usually have a lower sperm count and the woman, if she conceives, will usually go into preterm labor, have a low weight baby that must be on ventilators and the baby will usually have small lungs and a greater chance of asthma if the baby survives at all.    If you are truely trying to concieve I suggest you get your priorities straight first and clean yourself up and start getting healthy.  You don't need to bring a baby into that environment anyhow.
2nfMSDiPaa	Early, First Month Signs and Symptoms of Pregnancy    Pregnancy symptoms differ from woman to woman, and not all women will experience all of the typical early signs of pregnancy. However, many of the symptoms are extremely common, and nearly all pregnant women will experience one or more of these first signs and symptoms of pregnancy.    * Tender, swollen breasts are one of the early pregnancy symptoms. The discomfort you experience in your breasts may be similar to, but will usually be stronger than, that which you feel before your period. After the first trimester, the pain should diminish significantly, as your body adjusts to the new hormonal levels.     * Fatigue is another of the most common early signs of pregnancy. The stress of adjusting to the many physical changes you will experience along with the increased levels of progesterone your body will produce can lead to exhaustion, though this will most likely become less noticeable during the second trimester.    * Food cravings and aversions are extremely common during the early stages of pregnancy. Though food cravings are among the most well known early pregnancy symptoms, you may also experience aversions to foods that you previously enjoyed. This distaste may come and go throughout the pregnancy.    * A missed, late, or particularly light period is one of the more obvious early signs of pregnancy, especially if your period is usually regular. During the first month of your pregnancy, it is possible that you will have no symptoms other than this.    * Nausea or vomiting, commonly called morning sickness, can happen at any time of the day or night. Most women do not experience this symptom of pregnancy until about a month after conception, though some experience it very early.    * A heightened sense of smell can be one of the first month pregnancy symptoms. It is not uncommon for newly pregnant women to find normally acceptable or even pleasant smells repulsive and overpowering early in the pregnancy. Certain aromas may even trigger your gag reflex.    * Frequent urination is another of the most common early pregnancy symptoms. During pregnancy, the amount of blood and other fluid in your body rapidly increases, and your kidneys must process more than usual. As a result, more liquid ends up in your bladder. This will most likely persist during the pregnancy, as your growing baby exerts increasing pressure on your bladder.      Hope this helps hun!!Good luck baby dust to you.hope you get your BFP!!    P.s take the test after the missed period!!|`|4DoXomHZaa	If you had a period last month, you would have conceived about two weeks later...if you were pregnant you'd be 1 week....so your symtoms could not be related to that at all.     This happens to a lot of women TTC....pseudo-pregnancy symptoms...every fart and twitch is given signifigance.     Relax. There's only a 20% shot any given month, but healthy couples normally conceive within 12 months. Let nature do it's thing and stop jumping at shadows.|`|h5xSfcT6aa	you could. but it might say the wrong result. the best time to say it would be a week after your missed period.  it never says postiive when you re negative though. just the other way round, so you ll never get disappointed.  x|`|VeJH9b2yaa	its hormones, things change i have always had the sickness thing. your best testing a couple of days after you are due if you are late.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Some women experience bleeding while they are pregnant. It is possible your last period was just "break-through" bleeding and not an actual period. You can take a pregnancy test now. Usually nausea and sore breasts don't come up until about two weeks after implantation so if you're experiencing them now you may very well be pregnant. Good luck!|`|kykmpr0Caa	you can buy a test now for early pregnancy , i think its called first response, the box says you can do it up to 6 days before your period is due, and its supposed to be 97% accurate. i saw it today in superdrug|`|MmugX89aaa	well if yu dont have yur period.  yu possibly are pregnant.|`|PnZigfgHaa	Breast tenderness is a common symptom in early pregnancy, as is nausea.  If your last period was a lot lighter then it could mean that you are pregnant and had a small amount of breakthrough bleeding, which again is very common.  I would take a test as soon as you can.    Good luck x|`|hSOfnvuaaa	There is tests available to take before your 1st missed period if your that anxtious then take that, but if you feel you could hang on till your period or your missed period it result will be alot more accurate!     Good luck & Hope all goes well|`|DBrNaYNyaa	why not take a test? Wont hurt anyone and will put your mind at ease!!|`|h17G3paiaa	it's a possibility but i wouldn't waste your money taking tests a week before you are due for AF- wait until the day of AF to test.|`|0mSpQjzCaa	sounds like you could be.  I have three children and I spotted like you are describing with one of the pregnancies.   If you are it would show up on a pregnancy test now.  The eating defiantly sounds like you are.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	You can take a test now. Both times ive been preggo ive had some brown spotting when i was supposed to have a period then it stopped.|`|sWUxWeDfaa	Yea I would take a test. I know that when we were trying for a baby you notice all sorts of symptoms and wonder...am I?  The best thing is a test.|`|vgD95DLCaa	take a test to find out. You could be, or you could just wait until Feb 5th to see if you missed your next period
Xt1LxiWAaa	i'm 31 weeks with twins...and my babies have dropped. thank goshhh. i feel so much lighter and i can finally breathe. now that the baby/s have dropped, its because you do feel "lighter". its easier on your body...however, you will start feeling a lot of pelvic pressure. mine is so bad it hurts to move.     congrats!|`|yz6MsfCqaa	Lightning is a bolt of electricity caused by rain particles bumping into one another inside the clouds...Lightening is when a baby drops lower, making you feel lighter.

ZNhP3mpUaa	sure, breech babies can drop. Most practitioners these days though, will not deliver a breech baby, it's a lost art. Most will do a cesarean before the baby gets too far into the pelvic region... good luck! (search online for natural ways to "turn" the baby on your own!)    Go here! http://www.achildbirth.com/breech-birth....    all babies have to "drop" through the pelvis to be born naturally. It's just a matter of when. Some it happens hours before birth, others its days.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	he might have flipped over thru the night. he may be head down now. :)|`|7C9Ett7Caa	When a baby drops, whatever body part is "down" will desend further. So, yes, a breech baby can drop.. Congrats!!
GkhNUHofaa	not necessarily...i was reading about that in a pregnancy book last night and it said that they can give a round about guess but its not always accurate because the baby is surrounded by water and stuff that may make it harder to tell...they guessed about 8 pounds for my son and he ended up being 9.5 lol|`|MsipL0Mzaa	they think they can tell by feeling and by ultrasound...but i dont go by that...i was so concerned with my last that he would be so big...even while i was in labor they sain ...no.no more than 71/2....well he was huge 9 pounds huge....im worried about the size of this one....lol|`|PnZigfgHaa	An experienced midwife can make a reasonably accurate guess but as you note, it can depend on the way the baby is laying as well as how much fluid there is in your uterus.    Good luck x|`|siOmz2Dpaa	Firstly, its called a palpation, not palpitation (abnormal heartbeat), and yes, an experienced doctor or midwife can make an accurate guess.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	The can only guess.  My first baby was 8lbs 4oz, so with my second, I was starting to be worried about my baby's size when it was getting close to delivery time.  My doctor said that she didn't think that he was going to be big at all.  Uh. . .he weighed 9lbs 2oz!|`|01vMpHkWaa	good question  i dont think i want to know though  watch my doctor say "he feels about 7 pounds"  and then bomb! i shove out an elephant    id be upset  or if he said "he feels 10lbs"   i would be all worked up and then i pop out a hamster  id be upset|`|kcGFK36Waa	Yes. Well at least with my baby a few hours before I delivered the midwife said my baby was close to 8lbs just by feeling my belly and she was right on track Alyssa was 7 lbs 14 ounces.|`|TZ4mbFh3aa	I think everyone is different.  I am small, and so I was all baby.  I asked my doc what he thought her weight was the day before I had her, and he said 7-7 1/2 lbs...she turned out to be 6 lbs.
XPnCeJ29aa	They are selfish. And care about themselves more than anything else.  They do not understand the level of importance a baby is..   They have the idea that even if they do it or not, it will still get done..so they just dont do it.  It's sad. It takes a sad person..|`|E642wojhaa	They like to "play" but not "pay".|`|YFMaRxaWaa	guys most of them is quick to lay with you and get you pregnant but once the baby come they leave, because of the responsibility of parenting.as mother's it's our fault also.so my advice to you is to let him go on but one day when it's to late he'll regret turning his back on his child.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I don't know what your married/single status is but you have to think about that when you're having sex (if you're not married). If you're just dating or "hooking up", babies and long term goals don't play into the picture and you can't expect a picture perfect family when you are in that kind of situation. It sucks and is a shame for the child but that's the way it goes.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	sadly many women do the same. That's why they invented birth control.    They do it because they are selfish and don't want to take responsability, still have growing up to do, are scared, not prepared financially, etc...|`|Q2z5a4Xpaa	CAUSE YOU NOTHIN BUT A BOOTY CALL|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Arg! I'd like to ask my son's dad that! Maybe they just don't want kids.|`|kpPbnzwXaa	IMmaturity and selfishness|`|f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	I agree 100% with chicken.  No man wants a baby by a girlfriend.  So if you can't turn him into a husband, how can you expect him to turn him into a father?
CFFuFof1aa	Oh...having a baby is very exciting...and you should share it with everyone you care about. Why do you want to keep it a secret....if it's because you have heard that it is bad luck....don't believe it. I found out when I was 5 weeks pregnant. That day we told all of our family....and I have a beautiful baby girl!!! If you would feel better by waiting until your ultrasound that's fine too....then you could have your pics from the ultrasound to show them. But don't wait too long!! You should have people to share this with.     Congrats....and good luck!!!|`|NiOjHyfKaa	my last pregnancy i told everyone right away and at 7 weeks i miscarried and was terrified of running into someone i had told. being reminded of my loss was so depressing. this time when i got pregnant i was going to wait till about 10 weeks but an hour after i took the pregnancy test i started spotting and i had to ask my boyfriends sister to take me to the ER (i was so nervous of it happening again). it accidently got out i was pregnant and stories werent straight as to why i was in the hospital and so we just finaaly told them. i am now 13 weeks 2 days and just recently told a bunch of friends. it was hard  but i waited till around 11 and 1/2 weeks. good luck and its your choice!|`|4a2b1a81a9c8031e2a999ddf51108881aa	My SIL told the immediate families right away - I'm talking a week in.

NOTHING about the baby, just a website with the two of them and their dogs.  We (immediate family) knew the site was to be their family page, but they didn't want to let on yet and were starting it out as just the two of them.    They sent the announcement email about the website to EVERYBODY - literally calling people at work and asking for their emails to send this to.  Well, my SIL's sister "replies all" saying "AND BABY! YAY! CONGRATS!"  My BIL and SIL were beyond upset.  They had trouble conceiving and were hesitant to tell people until they were safely beyond the 12 week mark.  Plus, the sister had ruined their chance to give the news.  Now everybody they knew, knew they were prego and they didn't get the chance to tell anybody.  She said it was upsetting when they finally decided to tell people and the people said, "Yeah, so...? We knew ten weeks ago!"    My husband and I understood their side.  We told my family about the incident (AFTER the 12 weeks, when they were telling everybody) and my family had no idea why that would be an issue.  They said the sister had every right to do that, and they'd have done the same thing.    Long story short - we're not telling ANYBODY until we're sure this baby is okay.    (Oh, and my SIL is due next month...all is well there!)|`|owba80mcaa	Wow, you waited a lot longer than i ever did, as soon as i got a positive on a home pregnancy test i think that my whole town knew.  As, for your question, it is a personal choice on when you decide to tell people.  If you feel more comfortable waiting until you get and ultrasound, then do so.  But, I'm sure that your familes would love to share in your excitement now.  But, again its you and your signifigant others decsion  to tell your family.  Good luck to you!|`|7AYnWg3paa	tell the people u are closest to if u want...but please dont go out and start buying baby stuff  in the first trimester....i have seen people buy rockers and stuff and 6 weeks and misccarry....and i never understood why...its a really dum thing to do...    CONGRATS though!!?|`|ZU7rn7RHaa	I have told people quickly and I have waited.  It depends on how you feel.  I personally have gone through two miscarriages.  First one was easier because nobody new I was pregnant. It was harder when everyone knew for the second time.  If I get pregnant again I will wait til the middle of my second trimester.  That way its a sure thing!!  Congrats!!!|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Why do you want to wait??? Let everyone share in the excitement!|`|Kaudz4Msaa	You can tell family but not employers or coworkers yet.nWhy not wait a month? Not to be a downer, but anything could still happen,|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	I told everyone when i was 5 months pregnancy.  The only person that knew was my boyfriend|`|o8xNTVWTaa	i would do the exact same thing.... i think its more u wait until 12 weeks to tell like other ppl not including friends and close family. and if somthign did happen there family and they will be there supporting u everystep of the way   congrats !!!|`|ddP3klT3aa	I told my family when I found out..but I didn't tell any one else until I was 5 months. Why get people's hopes up and some thing happens?|`|OwK17Qo1aa	Well I'm 18 weeks right now and we didn't start telling people until last week. So I guess it all depends on what you feel comfortable with. To be honest I liked waiting this long so I didn't hear when you gonna start showing and all the other comments people say without thinking about. I really don't like telling some people cause it seems like we have to ask if its okay.|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	I think it's really up to you guys.  Just prepare yourselves for the next 2 months until you're in your 2nd trimester and in the clear for less problems.  If you're ok with his entire family knowing now, then share in a week or two after your ultrasound!     I waited until 5 or 6 weeks to tell everyone because I can't keep my mouth closed for a minute!  It's all up to you like I said.  Be optimistic and hope for the best, that's all we can do as women.  I'm 30 weeks and 5 days pregnant now loving it.      It's at your own discretion though, and the sooner you sometimes share- the more excitement you get from family and friends.      COngratS!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	The first time I told everyone I was pregnant at 5 weeks, but then I miscarried at 12 weeks.  This time around, we were going to wait until 12 weeks, but at 6 weeks I found out I was having twins so I had to tell everyone!  It's all up to you and your husband and what you feel comfortable with.  Rule of thumb is not to tell anyone who you would feel uncomfortable telling if you were to miscarry.  Personally, after I had a miscarriage the least of my worries was feeling uncomfortable telling people.  If your appointment goes well and you feel fine with it, go for it!  Good luck and congratulations!|`|yAVKWvDMaa	We wanted to wait 3 mons. too but just couldn't keep it in b/c we were ecstatic!  The only thing i would change is the way i told my husband.  I've always planned this big surprise thing (like I Love Lucy) but then one of my friends got a miscarriage on her first one, so I didn't do it.  I just told him once i found out.  For the 2nd one, I did a little surprise event to announce it.      It's very hard to decide so I guess based on your medical history, your age & your family's history then you can determine.  My family has no problems, except for one of my aunts.
Bw1h5xAcaa	Checking to feel the size of your uterus, which at this early stage needs to be compressed from both the inside and outside in order to feel it.|`|AA10390690	it's to check the size of the uterus|`|QMxEjCpiaa	He was making sure that there wasn't any lumps or abnormal places in your belly. He didn't hurt the baby at all. He also did a papsmear probably because he needed to check the bacteria level. If he said "everything seems great" then more than likely it is.     Good luck.|`|Ow6lKFXiaa	Well, pregnant or not, that is how they check your ovaries and uterus for any unusual shape, swelling or growths. Pressing down pushes the reproductive organs into a better position for examination. During pregnancy, this also helps determine the fetus's size and position inside the uterus.  There is, of course, more to it than that. Don't hesitate to call your doctor's office and ask the doctor or nurse for more details.|`|b7216cbf318e9848065ce69a86cc03dcaa	He was  checking for signs of pregnancy.  He was checking if the size of uterus was corresponding with your pregnancy dates.  Alarger size could call for excluding a multiple pregn ancy. Every thing seems to be great,  Good luck|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	He can feel the size of your uterus and any irregularities, as well as tell you about how far along you were.

xypA3yZMaa	Congrats! and very cute way of telling all of the family. It will be something you will never forget. My hubs and i waited two years on the dot and i just had to call my mom ASAP because she was wondering and she yelled on the phone of happiness. Then she proceeded to tell the entire family she said she couldn't hold it in. Good luck with your pregnancy.|`|8G0Lrwsgaa	i sent my mom a card saying "guess what...*opens card* YOUR AND GRANDMA AND GRANDPA!"  they loved it :D  and i love your idea too!!
HpWCjBv6aa	If the texts are really bothering you (or she starts calling you), contact your cell phone provider and have her number blocked, or change your current number.  I know it seems like a huge hassle, but it might be worth it in the long run.    You mention a son.  Do you have a house phone, or other form of communication where you can talk to her, but not receive these pictures?  If you could look into getting a house phone line, maybe for a little while, it would help.    How old is your son?  If he's three or older, she doesn't need to be introducing a new man into his life right now, because if he doesn't stick around, it could really affect him psychologically.  Have your ex sit down with you to talk, now.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Get sole custody, first of all.    Its obvious your ex is just as confused as you, with where you two stand.    Are you positive you are completely over her?    I think the best thing to do right now is ignore her 100%, get sole custody of your son, go to the place you bought your cell phone and have her number blocked.    If she continues to harass you or your song, maybe you should get the police involved?    I know that might be too much, but might be the only way for her to get the picture.          ...she sounds dammn annoying.    Ignore her texts, theyre just begging.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Your English worse than moldy cheese or, rotten milk.

Call the police if she doesn't stop. But you must tell her to leave you alone so she gets a warning. DO NOT DELETE THE MESSAGES!    Then take your kid away and say you don't trust her. Yes the messages can be use against her.

They are great resources for taking care of the baby as well.  Also, another great book is Baby Bargains that compares different items depending on quality, price & ease of use, etc.  They also tell you what is a waste of money and (if you have money, which is rare for everybody these days) what is worth to buy. Good luck!|`|7KHMepStaa	Why do you have 3 car seats?  It's not always good to stock up on bottles or formula because your baby may need a different formula than the ones you've bought, or may not adapt to the bottles you picked out.  The only other thing I can think of is some soft baby washcloths and gentle baby cleansers.  Some infant fever reducer is good to have on hand and a good thermometer.  I'm thinking you don't mean she's going to induce you now, because I don't think they would do that at 5 months just for being big, unless the baby 's health was failing.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	bibs... baby bath products (baby soap and lotion)....hooded towels...a good breast pump machine (if wanting to breastfeed)....a boppy (my lifesaver)...extra sheets... blankets....bouncer....swing...|`|DgmDfwxDaa	Bottle Brush, gas drops, soft baby hair brush, baby soap, baby lotion, baby oil, baby nail clippers, plenty of sheets for the crib and basinett, diaper bag, maybe a baby monitor, bouncy seat (they are a life saver!), baby tylenol just in case!

I was formula fed and never had one either. In fact, my brothers and cousins were all formula fed and the only one who ever got an infection was my younger cousin who was breastfed. He got so many ear infections he had to have tubes put in.    I know breast is best and all that, but breastmilk doesn't always mean a perfectly healthy baby, does it.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	My son has never had an ear infection.      I formula feed.

He will be 1 year old next week...|`|XxRKLyqLaa	my two kids were bottle fed the first 1 never got an ear infection and my daughter go a hole lot too many to count them.:S what Ive learned about the ear infections is that its caused buy the growth of teeth when the kids are theething they get there nose all stuffy and get colds. since my daughter has done theething well she done with the ear infections.|`|DvrpBX4saa	Formula fed. No ear infections.    My  best friend's son was BF and he has had multiple ear infections.    There are other factors, other than formula and breastmilk. You still cannot deny that bm is better for babies, though.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	I was formula feed and I had ear infections but so did my lil bro who was breastfed. We both ended up needing tubes as well. The reason for the raised issue of formula against breastfed is some moms when they bottle feed lay the baby down. The ears nose and throat are all connected. So when the formula pools in his throat it risks getting in to the ear canal causing an infection breastfed babies have a low risk cause you have to angle their heads to reach the breast.     the ear infections have nothing to do with formula to breastmilk but in the way of the feeding and the angle of their head.     I feel there is to much push by those who are strong minded to breast feeding only. I am the oldest of 6 and 3 were BF and 3 were formula, 2 BF and 2 formula had ear infections 1 BF 1formula had issues with agnoids and we all had major issues with tonsils. 1BF and 1 formula child is from a different father.     ALSO SMOKING RAISES THE RISK OF EAR INFECTIONS!!    ALSO Letting water get in the ears from swimming before a year old I read causes ear infections cause the water is dirty adn gets in the ear and since the ear is still so fresh it creates infection. *read this in a book cause I want to get my son in swimming as soon as possible... water baby|`|AA10186411	My daughter has had several, and is formula fed.  BUT, both my nieces are formula fed and have never had one.  So I think thats bull.  It depends on the child, not the method of which they are fed.|`|AA10624857	Depending on the study you look at, there does seem to be higher instances of ear infections in bottle fed babies. However, this does not translate to mean that bottle fed babies will have a lot of ear infections nor does it mean that breast fed babies won't get them. My 3rd baby was only breast fed until she weaned to a cup. She never had formula or a bottle yet she had numerous ear infections. More than I think I could even count unless I got her pediatrician records. Many went into draining ear infections because her tolerance for pain is quite high plus she never ran a fever with her ear infections so in the early years, before she could talk, we'd often not know she had an ear infection until it was draining. She had so many ear infections that she actually has hearing loss in her left ear, which is also the ear that had the most ear infections. My oldest was breast fed until 5 months than was on formula and she had a few ear infections, but nothing like my third baby. My youngest was exclusively breast fed until just before 7 months old. She is 11 years old now and has only had 2 ear infections in her whole life, but she's had numerous cases of strep throat. There is some research that suggests that because bottle feeding is done in a more reclined position than breast feeding that is the main reason why bottle feeding babies have a higher rate of ear infections. It is not due only to the formula, but rather the position the baby is held in. Bottle fed babies who are held in a more upright nursing position have fewer cases of ear infections.|`|IWinNj2saa	My first 2 sons were bottle fed, and the 2nd son has had maybe 2 ear infections, he's almost 9. My third son was breastfed, and he has only had 1, and that was a month ago, and he's 18 months old.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	My daughter is 11 1/2 months and has only had 2 ear infections. The second one was due to the first one not going away completely. I breast fed and formula fed until she was 2 months old and then after that she was just on formula because I dried up.. But so far she hasnt been sick with the cold or the flu. Just 2 ear infections. My daughter's doctor said that breastmilk helps with everythind. So I believe what you read can be true..

Your baby will come out when its ready. =) You're almost there!|`|hhPIfuiZaa	you can be dilated for a long time, i started to dilate then had to be induced 3 weeks later.  it is just your body getting ready, and those babies have a mind of their own.  that last couple of weeks seems like a year!!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	With her youngest my sister was dilated like forever.  She was at 1cm 6 weeks before she gave birth and every week she would dialate a little bit more.  The doctor finally just induced labor because she was dilated to a 5.  She had had no major pains or contractions or anything.  It just kind of happened on it's own.|`|b4fYwZeraa	I was dilated to 1cm and then 2 the entire month before I delivered.|`|zwctZ812aa	Yes.  I was dilated 1 cm at 34 weeks, and 2 cm starting at 37 weeks.  I went overdue.  The bleeding was just from the exam, it is common to bleed afterwards.  Dilating just means your body is getting ready, but you can stay that way for weeks.  I was 1 cm for over 6 weeks!
9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	That is a common occurance in a pregnant woman.  I cannot begin to count the number of days I have sat at work and dabbed a tissue at my nose trying to dry the blood.  It's due to the increased blood flow in the body.    In fact, today my nose has bled twice.  I thought it was just sinus drainage and when I glanced at the tissue, it was covered in blood - my co-worker freaked out, LOL.     It's normal!|`|QRHufyHiaa	i did read somthing about pregnancy causing nose bleeds. i'm not sure what causes it but hopefully everything is fine. good luck!|`|m7vMT6Loaa	You Might Just Have High Blood Pressure. U Should Try Visiting The Doctor.|`|O5WJGTmVaa	I had that happen with my third pregnancy as well, the doc told me it was totally normal, he also said it was normal for your gums to bleed and be more sensitive.  Just like you it didn't happen with either of my boys, but did with my little girl.  Good luck!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Same thing happens to me. Mine doesn't drip either but when I blow my nose, blood comes out. I read online that it's because of the extra blood flow in your body.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Normal! You're blood supply increases during pregnancy to keep up with your baby! Nosebleeds, thigns like that i've read are common. Excessive ones you may want to report to your dr though!    Yes, nosebleeds do tend to occur more often during pregnancy. Pregnancy can cause the blood vessels in your nose to expand, and your increased blood supply puts more pressure on those delicate vessels, causing them to rupture more easily. Although it's unpleasant and inconvenient, an occasional minor nosebleed is generally harmless.    IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE!!|`|AA10390690	I've heard of that happening during pregnancy but what could cause it, I'm not quiet for sure. Wish I could help! Ask the doctor at your next appointment =] And maybe try using a humidifier at night|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I have the same problem. Not a nosebleed exactly but when I blow my nose there are small blood clots there. And yes, I hear that is a sign of pregnancy.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	bloody noses are so common during pregnancy! it happens with me all of the time. the cause is just the same as inflamed and bleeding gums. your hormones and an increase on blood flow.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, my doctor told me it's from a combination of the pregnancy hormones and an increase in blood supply.  Almost every time I get sick my nose bleeds a little.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	My nose and gums do that sometimes since I have been pregnant.  Its because its dry outside and when your pregnant your body gets even more dry.  I recommend a humidifier in your bedroom and maybe in a few other rooms as well.  Everytime I use my humidifier I feel much better and don't bleed as much.
r52rfBkeaa	If you want your son to keep up his eating, you need to pump when he would normally eat.  If it's every 2 hours, then that's when you need to pump.    (By the way, you make milk based on the demand.  If you pump/nurse every 2 hours, you make more than if you were to do it every 4.)    When my son was about 6 months old, I started to pump every 3 hours, because that's how often he nursed.  I would give him what I pumped and if he was still hungry, I offered him the breast again.  Then we only nursed first thing in the morning and at night.    You can make it work, but it may take some trial and error.|`|u12eVaDhaa	Hi, you don't say how old your son is but if he is under 6 months, you should really keep right on nursing on demand.  The problem with pumping is that it produces a different quality of milk to that obtained when the baby nurses.  NOTHING milks the breast as effectively as the baby's jaw and mouth muscles becuase of course the two things are designed for each other.  Research has found that pumping TOO much will eventually diminish your supply as it doesn't drain the breast fully which then gives your body the message that Demand is less than it was and therefore the milk supply reduces.  For that reason if you want to continue breastfeeding, you should nurse most of the time and pump occasionally if you really need to.      The other important factor is that it is much easier for babies to get milk from a bottle and that does mean that once bottles are offered regularly they will stop wanting the breast.      Every two hours is feeling like hard work now but it will get better and ease off.  Gaps between feeds will get bigger and on the occasions when he feeds more then you can probably assume he's having a growth spurt.    Best wishes
hKJIDdVqaa	how about preventing pregancy in the first place. Stop having sex and start playing barbies...You  are the reason people are anti abortion. Abortion is not a form of birth control.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	Abortion is not illegal anywhere and you can not get an abortion for free. You can if you want a friend to shove a metal coathanger in your and start fishing around. (Please don't do this.)     Since you are 15, it's impossible to get an abortion without a guardian's consent. Tell your parents. They will help you decide whats best for you.|`|AA10390690	welp, welcome to reality and motherhood. i'd recommend you talking to a trusted adult and consider ALL options, not just jumping to abortion.|`|8I4QY6osaa	Oh no!  This is why I wanted to become a republican  don't do it!  PLEASE!|`|miPubuDYaa	Abortion is still legal.     I'm not sure if you can get it for free. Call planed parenthood and they will help with any concerns, money-wise, physically or mentally that you will face.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	I'm pretty sure you could have gotten condoms for free.    You probably should have started there.    Tell your parents... and stop having sex, you are too young.|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	it is legal however I believe if you are under 18 you need a parent to sign for you.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	it is legal as long as it is done within the first trimester. go to a planned parenthood. they will probably be able to help you the best. its not always free, its based off income, so im not sure how it works with your age and if you aren't working. they are confidential though so they wont call your parents.|`|Wok0Y6ebaa	You cannot have an abortion for free.  There is no clinic that does that.  My advice for you......get a test and find out for sure.  There are family planning clinics that offer free pregnancy testing.  If you aren't, then learn to be more responsible about sex.  It isn't just pregnancy you have to worry about.  A $1 condom is cheaper than thousands of dollars it will cost to treat an STD or have a baby.|`|ZVqEDvZSaa	you shouldnt have been so stupid. Having sex at 15..and now you want to kill a innocent baby because of a mistake you made. Seriously you need to grow up and take action for your mistakes since you thought you were such an adult having sex at 15|`|kbIkVS0raa	Its legal and I have never heard of it being free. It usually costs between 350-700 depending on how far along you are and where you go
kcGFK36Waa	at 34 weeks my baby was 5 pounds exactly and she weighed 7 lbs 14 ounces and was 19 inches long.|`|H0fXySX9aa	i had one at 34 weeks with my second daughter and she weighed as an estimate 4 poundS  She weighed 7 pounds at birth|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	ill let you know, i have mine tomorrow :)|`|Yf9VZunaaa	I'm 37 weeks today and had an ultrasound last friday, baby weighed in at 7lbs even.  I'm hoping he's not gonna get but so much bigger!  My mom had two 10lb babies, I don't want to be destined to her fate!  Our baby boy is head down and starting to engage so we'll see what happens!     Good luck!|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	omg dont belive it! lol!  they told me at  36weeks my babe was 6 pounds so about the same as you.  they told me that from then on the baby would gain a certain amount of wieght per week meaning that she would be a 8pound baby at birth,she wasnt! she was 6'12.  :D x|`|9CkHsLl2aa	mine weighs 4 pounds at 31 wks.|`|fQGzk5izaa	Just so you know ultrasounds are notoriously wrong at predicting weight!!!  Ask how many woman have had an ultrasound weight be way off ( like 2 lbs or more) and I bet you get an awful lot of responses!!!!  Its exciting when they tell you how much baby weighs but they are usually off!!|`|PnZigfgHaa	5.89 pounds is an reasonable weight for a 35 week baby.  A baby will usually gain anything from 8oz to 1lb a week in the last four weeks of pregancy so it looks like your baby will be a good healthy weight but not overly big.    Good Luck x    (My baby was 8lb)|`|14JQ11AUaa	My son was 7lbs 4oz and 19in at birth, he was born at 38 1/2 weeks!
u7kDLuklaa	She is recommending that you try natural induction methods now?  Wow thats pretty early.  I would think they would want to monitor you carefully at this point during any sort of induction attempt.    I have tried nipple stimulation and i felt exactly like you describe.  All i got out of it was pelvic pressure and heaviness and a few random braxton hicks contractions.  I was overdue when i tried it.    Having it put you into labor is questionable at your stage of gestation.  I think generally when it works your body and hormone levels are ready for labor/delivery.  You're pretty early yet.     Good luck to you and you baby!  I hope things turn out like you want them to.|`|QoSZQ8ZWaa	Early or beginning contractions can feel like pressure.  I questioned what it was for a while.  My sister used nipple stimulation and it did work for her.  I tried it but didn't keep up with it...got to irritating.  Good luck!
s4LWmcTjaa	In a word:  YES.    What kind of parent loves their pet  more than their children?    I feel so sad for your son.  He deserves a loving parent that puts him above an animal.|`|AA10811784	Absolutely NOT normal. You should love them both, but in different ways. I can't believe someone would not want to cuddle with their own child. That is bad.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Yeah I would say this is abnormal.|`|xnhwmontaa	Yes it is bad....maybe u should have kept ur legs closed or slept with the dog......love ur dog more than ur own child? thats sick and u dont deserve kids! they r some people who would kill for a child of their own! and u wanna hug ur dog....be ashamed! i think if i were your husband i would get rid of the dog behind ur back.....maybe then u would act right...|`|AA10531094	No, that's pretty pathetic!|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Wow, give your son to someone with their priorities straight. Then you can give your  fleabag all the love you refuse to give your son.     While you're at it, please go get yourself spayed or neutered.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No, I can't say that is very normal|`|BXWvqUfGaa	Post-natal depression??|`|vFFgHI9Kaa	yes that is bad.  Get rid of the dog.  concentrate on your child.|`|LeK1tSQWaa	It can be normal but depends what situation,   If your child is really annoying and nags all the time then it is ok but you will prefer your child eventually so don't worry|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Wow that is sad.    I don't know if I'd label you abnormal but I'd definitely talk to someone about that.    So if you had to choose between your child and your dog who would you choose?|`|32bc5fa3ec98f44addcaee08016e9b86aa	It might be normal, but it's sad more than it is bad. You may be tired of your son, so you want to see your dog more. Or it could be like when you go to school and you want to see your friends, but when you go home you don't really want to be there because of your family.|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	It is certianlly NOT NORMAL!|`|DZCFD0p2aa	depends on how good or bad your child is. My dogs always listen to me. I don't know if my children will.|`|t36Dce0Laa	Well, Its ok if you love your dog in a seperate way than your child|`|Jpgz4mSVaa	no/yes|`|zATQaiwIaa	yes its weird.  Your dog gives love unconditional, your child is work - but normally the love for your child should be greater than that of your dog.  I know my love for my daughter doesnt even compare to what i feel for my cat.|`|hnXTR8Wwaa	Maybe you should put your boy up for adoption and give your pet its old room, lmao, no, you shouldn't love your dog more then your child.|`|frpCK0utaa	yes. How can you love an animal more then your own child?|`|7ldEn0fJaa	haha because the  child is always screaming and crying and the dog is aways happy to see you when you get home everytime.    But i think it is kinda bad, but i would rather cuddle with my dog than my child any time[ if i had one] because dogs are furry and cuddley|`|5EOLbVzQaa	No that is not normal it is kind of sad....|`|yLyMG8Emaa	Is this a joke? The fact that you have to ask this question is very disturbing to me. I could never imagine loving an animal more than I love my own child. And thats for any reason!|`|185eb50393051dd4ae601a37cf4949cfaa	No it is not normal to love your dog more than your own child|`|lXgCj1RJaa	You don't love your child in the same way that you love your dog, any more than you love your husband/wife in the same way that you love your child or the way that you love your mother/father. Some love is easier to express because the recipient's response is unquestioning and unconditional. That doesn't mean your feelings are stronger, just closer to the surface; often, the feelings that are harder to express and that are a long way below the surface are stronger.|`|rTscI3Lwaa	lmao you got post natal depression either that or you realy do hate your child awwwwww so funny it hurts, your nearly as cruel as me ring your gp up|`|dafae2ae3b86a68e315dfbc92b268dc5aa	You  brought  an  innocent  human  child  onto  this  harsh  planet  and   Now  he  rates  Below  the  dog ?    You  should  Never   have  another  child .  You  are  a  classic  example  of   the  need  for  birth  control .    Hope  you  retrieve  your  head  from  your  nether  region  before  the  child  endures  any  more  damage .    >|`|KK3RkRjxaa	Your poor child!! I already love my child more than  my dog and she's not even here yet!|`|5Jn3i45Naa	ya know wut? you have problems. **** you **** you to hell. go have sex with your dog and have puppies. **** you bastard|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Not normal at all.  Seek professional help, you have a problem.    I feel sorry for your kid...|`|YFMaRxaWaa	than you have a problem.your child need the same and more attention as your dog.and that child probably know the difference all ready .shame on you.  lol|`|CaMOjt5kaa	Its Horrible! You son should come first. The dog is more likely to die. It'll be better if you get more attached to your son.|`|RgMHqCRtaa	well don't take it to far it matter how old your son is if he is a new born then cuddle your dog when he is asleep but if he is like 10 or whatever then that's pretty bad you cant replace your own son with a dog|`|VLQXcPKfaa	No, its normal.  I cuddle up to my hampster every evening.|`|39wcLSoPaa	it is very bad to love a dog more than your own flesh a blood.|`|0VUZacRTaa	I Truly am not trying to be mean. But I think you should go to therapy. It is not a good thing to feel more love for your dog more than your child. I have a dog that I love a lot, she was my baby. But since my child was born, she is definitely on the back burner. I still love her, but nothing in comparison to my daughter.|`|lhFD9BdBaa	your ****** up
CIZjK2rAaa	My ovulation test remained positive after I ovulated. I asked my friend who is a nurse and she said I must have conceived.  She was right!  I am now 13 weeks 2 days.    Baby Dust!|`|FSY30gbvaa	Usually it will show up positive.|`|FTW82Wumaa	To my knowledge, the OPK (ovulation predictor kit) will show a stronger and stronger positive up to your ovulation day (that day being the strongest positive). If you're pregnant, I have heard that the OPK will remain positive the whole time (ovulating or not).    I have never used one so I don't really know from experience. This website has a bunch of information on HPTs and OPKs. I would suggest not wasting your money on OPKs to use them to test for pregnancy. There are alot of inexpensive, accurate tests out there now.    Good luck.
XPnCeJ29aa	Brody decided HE wanted to feed himself, he wouldnt let me feed him anymore, so I put the food down, and he went to town. About 7 1/2 months.    he started trying sippy cup at about 6 months I believe, I wanted him to get comfortable with it without the pressure.  So in 2 months when I take the bottle away, it isnt a huge adjustment.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I gave all my children a sippy cup around five months.  I let them try to feed themselves at about 9 months or sooner if they could grasp.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	feeding themselves around a year old but I would allow them to hold a spoon earlier than that while I fed them so they would feel like they were helping too.     Sippy cup they started around 6-8 months so that way they were good at it by 12 months when the bottle went bye bye.|`|1wQgeBwSaa	I would say between the age of 6 - 8 months and as long as it does not affect the mother's nursing routine/choices.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Nine months is when I gave my child a tippy cup. He does it on his own really good now, he's one year old.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	6months with a sippy sup and 12months for feeding themselves other than snacks they could hold.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I gave them finger foods like cheerios etc around 6 or 7 mos, they mostly just tossed them around though, anything with a spoon, around 12-14 mos. I gave them a sippycup at 5 mos. Of course I had to help them hold it but around 7 or 8 mos they held it on their own|`|EW1g3VDnaa	We started my son on a sippy cup around 8 months. He's now 11 months and he drinking out of one fine.|`|185eb50393051dd4ae601a37cf4949cfaa	My daughter was a year old when she feed herself for the first time and the same for the sippy cup.
s4LWmcTjaa	You co-worker needs to suck it up and take one for her daughter.  Sounds like she's looking for people to feel sorry for *her* when in fact she herself only cares for her own selfish wants and not for her daughter's wants.    I would attend.  Even if I didn't like the woman, for my daughter I would attend.  If it's that important to my daughter, I will suck it up for her.|`|AA10811784	Yes, I would go. For my daughter. And set all other feelings aside.|`|xnhwmontaa	i would go to pay my respects with my daughter.....dead is dead they are never coming back might as well leave them on a good note|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Yes, I had to take my son when my ex's father passed on.  It was the right thing to do.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Yes I  would.  For my daughter.  That is my job.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	Of course! It's the child's grandmother. Your coworker should stop being selfish and think of her daughter. She refused to go to her the funeral because she doesn't want to see her ex? That's ridiculous. I would go if my daughter asked me to support her.|`|zATQaiwIaa	ABSOLUTELY!  No matter what your daughter is your number one priority in life and if she needs you right now as her grandmother just passed then you go - no questions asked.  If anyone comments on why you are there just simply say you are there to help support your daughter through this time.|`|kpPbnzwXaa	Yes I went to a funeral in a similar situation as that, and he was very ungrateful but I went for my daughter...|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Yes! The funeral isn't just for the dead person it is also for the people left behind. Your daughter needs your support and comfort while she says good bye to her grandma.|`|Jpgz4mSVaa	yes i would go. for the daughter's sake.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Of course!  Who wouldnt?|`|5EOLbVzQaa	If i was in your co-workers position yes i would go. her daughter should be allowed to say goodbye to her grandma.|`|AbCeEZIhaa	Why can't he pick up his daughter so she can spend a couple days with him and his family? Seems like she has made it more about her and less about her daughter.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	yes i would do it to support my daughters. if she don't want to go into the funeral sit outside and wait on the girls.but be there for them she don't have to go shake hands all she has to do is sit in the back and wait.|`|KK3RkRjxaa	I sure would!! My mother attended a funeral on my dad's side of the family when I was younger and they hate each other! It's a time to put  your differences aside!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	DEFINITELY!  You always feel better when you're the bigger person.|`|wwruddXQaa	yes i think you should go with her even if our ex's family don't want you there you shouldn't listen to what they say but you daughter will respect you in the long run she will also need you support|`|yLyMG8Emaa	Most definitely! Your daughter is most important. Forget about the bad blood in the past. You never know, your presence along with your daughter could really touch the lives of others. Good luck!|`|185eb50393051dd4ae601a37cf4949cfaa	I would go to accompany my daughter and support her try to put your feelings aside it is a funeral your ex mother home going.|`|39wcLSoPaa	of course i would. It's my family. Family is much better than a grudge.|`|rTscI3Lwaa	yea just for the sake of pi$$ing everybody off.|`|tkzaLPDraa	I would suck it up and go for my daughter.|`|K94jSa1iaa	I would!  I think your daughter needs your support and needs you to be there for her.  Forget about the past.  You will look like a hero to your daughter and others as you handle this situation with grace. Grace looks good on everyone! Did Prince Charles go to Princess Diana's Funeral?
e8WVidSsaa	I agree with that article.    I think that it's true that kids with strange names are more likely to be...stranger. Definitely not all the time! But more likely.|`|0aebc3da094dcd85852e8ef94004b113aa	Hey...I JUST now read that article! If you read it, they're not saying that if you have an uncommon name, you're more likely to break the law per se.    But think about it...people with "uncommon" names tend to have ethnic names, and as we know, America still isn't exactly welcoming of all ethnicities. So when LeMarcus Jenkins or Carlos Hernandez is denied employment over and over and over again, he'll most likely go out and sell drugs, or start snatching purses or something like that....|`|PXAr9JPmaa	I don't think a name has anything to do with how you will turn out in the future but it is how your parents raise you. I think it is a coincidence.|`|g54tGcRvaa	Who cares?  They provide no compelling body of data, only an improvised rationale.  To be serious, sociology is mostly junk science.  There's WAAAY too many variables to give this thesis any measurable shred credibility.  Go name him Dweezilworth, and I 99% promise you he won't grow up to cannibalize children.  Strange names may inspire creativity and unexpected social dynamics, but nothing that a few numbers from a study are going to make sense of.|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	No, i LOVE unique boy names |`|oKZ3GstXaa	I think that is bs, it makes no sense.
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Are you trying for a VBAC this time or are you planning for a repeat c-section? What were your complications, if you don't mind my asking? That could be a factor, depending on what they are. It's totally up to YOU whether you want to try a VBAC (again, depending on the reasons for your first section).     There are ways they can tell if the placenta is functioning properly. I don't know that the scar itself really poses any risk to the baby if you go overdue. Just being overdue in and of itself shouldn't affect the scar at all, especially if you're planning on another section. In fact, there are often 'windows' or areas where the scar has separated even in women who haven't hadn't VBACs - in other words, when they go in to do the next section they can see the separation. It usually poses little to no risk and is considered harmless and unnoticeable.     If you're planning a VBAC, they might worry the baby could get too big to deliver vaginally. However, there is nothing saying you couldn't have a vaginal with a 'big' baby (normal size is actually anything between 6-9 lbs, actually) and lots of women go on to have babies vaginally that are considered 'large' - some women VBAC with a baby who was bigger than their first and do just fine.     At least you know your body *can* go into labor on its own; that's one key factor. If you're not having a VBAC I wouldn't even worry about it unless you really want the baby to choose its own birthdate - which I am a huge advocate for, at least with my own children! :) in which case you could just tell them to leave you alone as long as you know everything is going okay with the placenta and baby, etc.     I didn't go overdue with either child, but was told that if I did (with my VBAC) they would do a c-section, since they didn't use PItocin because of the risk of uterine rupture. Actually, first they told me they would do a biophysical profile - which I assume is an ultrasound to check for the function of the placenta, and then would probably do the section if I didn't go into labor by a certain time.     Email me if you have any questions! :D|`|x32vIjXHaa	Okay, I haven't had Number 2 yet, but I will in july 2009. My OB told me that they will not let a woman go over 39 weeks if they have had a previous c section. He also said that the 39 weeks is for woman who are healthy, have no high risks, and are not dilated yet. Every OB is different, but even everything I have read say that second sections are taken between 38-39 weeks. Good luck to you and congrats on baby  2.
58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I'm the same way. I have started avoiding the questions on here that ask when your baby hit certain milestones because I don't remember and I'm too lazy to go get the book and see.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Sat up--10 months (i know, he was a little late for that one)    Sippy cup--41/2 months for the soft top kind and 10 months for the hard top    Fed himself with spoon--7 months (although it wasn't mastered until 14 months)    First walked--He took his first steps on June 17 (13 months old) and then didn't take a single other step until he was 15 1/2 months old and he just randomly started walking everywhere one day.    First talked--his first word was "uh-oh" and he started saying that at about 14 months.  It was closely followed by daddy, thankyou, and bye bye.  he just now started saying mom and only occationally.    So I guess no, I don't have to look at the baby book.  But I have a really good memory.  If you asked my husband any of these he might say everything about 2 months later than it actually happened.  I don't think it's abnormal.....|`|kpPbnzwXaa	I kept a baby book, for this reason, if I tried to guess, it would probably be close to the age...but not exact im sure.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Ha!  yes.      I can't remember when exactly my daughter drank from a sippy cup, I think somewhere around a year??    Spoon - no idea!  She's 22 months now and pretty good with a spoon but far from perfect.    Walked - 15 months, I remember this one.  It was June 23rd!!  First talked - around one year.    Yes, I guess it's normal.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Charlotte is almost 10 months old and while I remember all her milestones now I don't think I will in a year's time.  Better get on that baby book huh?!|`|1Du4Rudvaa	My daughter is only four so I do remember most of those things.  When I am asked I do have to think about it, though.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Can I just say that i have 2 kids, and I think it gets worse the more you have.  I remember more of my daughters milestones than my sons and she is 4 years older.  The only thing I know out of that list is when they first walked. And I only know what month it was in.  I think it's normal.|`|ucQyVlZGaa	Yes b/c even with one child so much happens that you can't remember everything. The only things that sticks out to me that I can recall like yesterday was when I gave birth...That was the most important thing to me.|`|RgMHqCRtaa	yea your not going to always remember the exact date and time maybe the year but it normal not to remember|`|NAbZ5FEwaa	I can remember the month age of when my daughter started doing all of that..but not the date itself. Like I know she sat up at 3 1/2 months, was 5 months when she drank from a cup, 9 months when she got good at using a spoon (still cant use a fork well LOL), walked at 14 months, said something other then mama dada at 9 months, (started dada at 4 months and mama at 6 months) And she is 18 months now.|`|rt4OnxkYaa	i have one child and i dont reemmber any of those things... i was really young when i had my son and it just didnt even phase me to write it down or keep a memory book.
O5WJGTmVaa	There is a wonderful thing out there called Teething tablets, you can get them virtually anywhere.  They don't have anything that can harm your baby or make them sleep.  But they work wonderful, when I have had restless nights with my children I gave these to them and within a half hour they were asleep because the pain was gone.  You just put two of them under the tongue and let them dissolve(which they do rather fast).  I think its the best thing out there!  Good luck.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Are you sure its not his ears bothering him?  You could try the pain relieving ear drops, they are available over the counter.    Also clove oil is very effective at relieving gum pain.    http://www.parenttime.com/babyarticles/t...  Other natural remedies include herbs and oils, which can alleviate pain or help your baby calm down and get to sleep. One common remedy for the pain of toothache and teething is clove oil. Cloves contain oils that have warming, numbing properties, so that even holding a whole clove against a sore tooth with your tongue can ease the pain long enough to get to your dentist. Clove oil can be rubbed on sore gums to relieve pain, but only use a tiny amount: too much can upset your baby's stomach. Other homemade remedies include letting your infant chew on a natural licorice stick (the herb, not candy!) You can find natural licorice in health food stores: real licorice feels cool and also numbs the gums when your baby chews on it. Wild fennel, a relative of licorice, grows in disturbed areas in Northern California and other parts of the country: you may be able to harvest it yourself along the bike paths. The feathery, fern-like leaves and hollow stalks can be chewed or sucked for a cooling, licorice-tasting treat.    Some parents find that rubbing a little pure vanilla extract on the baby's gums can soothe the crying child: this home remedy may work in three ways. First, merely rubbing baby's gums can ease the pain by creating opposite pressure; second, the alcohol in vanilla extract will create a warm sensation that is temporarily comforting. The third way this remedy may work is in the calming properties of vanilla itself. Vanilla is known as a soothing yet energizing agent that reduces anxiety and promotes feelings of well-being. Besides that, vanilla has long been used to cure stomach distress: a baby whose stomach is mildly upset from crying or swallowing large amounts of drool may find vanilla soothing to the tummy as well as the nerves.     http://www.whatreallyworks.co.uk/start/k...  To relieve sore gums, dilute one drop of clove oil in 1-2 tablespoons of safflower oil, dip your clean forefinger in this mix and gently massage the affected area. Repeat this 2-3 times a day.    Teething toddlers will also find relief from chewing on long, thin, and sweet-tasting pieces of liquorice root. (Mail order from Farmacia on 0207-831 0830). You can also make a soothing paste from powdered liquorice root, which you then pat gently onto the sore gum area. You can buy quality herbs and essential oils from Napiers (0131-343 6683).|`|pV6K2mm5aa	I never did it ...but I know children that had alcohol (rum) rubbed on their gums for the pain.  (do not drink!! rubbed on with a finger)  Children's/baby numbing cream (been to long to remember name).  Never heard of ashron-parsons.  Good luck|`|iX5p5pHwaa	testing 123|`|SRK8pJ0Qaa	i have always uses infants tylenol with my 8 month old daughter. give it to your baby at least half an hour before you put him/her to bed.|`|BypjotRpaa	i give my son tylenol and humphrey's teething tablets right before bed..maybe call your pediatrician to make sure of the dosage ..may your not giving the correct about for weight. (humphreys)may be you can order them online|`|deAyKj2Uaa	nighttime- during the day stick 3-4 of those gel type teething rings in the freezer. then, if they have trouble at night, give your child one of the rings.  the gel doesnt actually freeze so they can still bit on it, and it will make their gums feel great.  i was worried about my childs hands getting cold while holding the ring, but she was so elated to have relief that she didnt even notice the cold on her hands.    daytime- buy a package of waffles and when your child is have trouble give them a waffle to suck on.  babies love them and they love the different flavors they come in.  it has the same effect as the teething ring and its got built in drool cups. :)|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Teething Medicine Recipe from a friend with six kids:    Sprinkle sugar on a thin slice of onion.

It's magic!|`|EJh9oimXaa	obviously, this might be a little out of line, but whenever I have a toothache, the only thing that helps is smoking marijuana.

13d2e11e5cf2ba44870b2f79efdac5f2aa	Your chart looks great! I would bet that you're pregnant! But, be careful, because I had those signs, and I was pregnant with an ectopic pregnancy. So, make sure your doctor knows that this isn't normal for you. i hope you gat your BFP soon!|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	I didn't get my bfp till a week after I missed af.|`|Wok0Y6ebaa	Wait for the blood test if you don't start bleeding.  You might just not have enough hormone in your system for a positive test right now.  Every woman is different.
veO1RXrCaa	Its all ahead for a vaginal birth unless something comes up before or during labour.  Like the baby is breech or the placenta is sitting funny.  Or labour complications happen.    ETA Ignore the idiot below me.  Its not changed.  The vagina can and does stretch.  And its snaps back.|`|AA11210211	Normally you won't find out until you are actually going to give birth unless there is a preexisting condition(IE high blood pressure,previous c-sec ETC)that causes you to have one.Why do you want to elect to have one??If so I say try vaginal, c-sections SUCK majorly,If I had had a choice I would have tried vaginally.|`|RjoCYCkQaa	You should choose to have one because i heard that the vagina is never the same again after vaginal birth. A doctor once likened it to a deep impact crater.|`|bTlhBX3daa	Typically, a C-Section is something that will be decided on very late in the pregnancy, if say the baby is breech or you have Placenta Previa, or something goes wrong, etc.     However, I THINK you can schedule to have a C-section if that is what you prefer. You would need to talk to your Dr. about it.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	You wouldnt know til way later on, only if you have complications. Some women have to get emergency c-sections while they are in labor. Dont pay any attention to mr awesome, he is on here all the time getting a kick out of being rude and pissing people off.|`|0F3u5RpTaa	I had a C-Section, when I went into the hospital and my daughters arm was sticking out instead of her head.  Do the imagine that, and I would not have had a live baby.  or myself .  My second daughter was C-Section because of the first C-Section, as my doctor felt safety was more important than regular delivery... which, believe me, it was, and alot easier.  My poor husband asked me what he should do after the baby was born, I told him go celebrate with family/friends as all I wanted to do was sleep away the fears I had. He was so grateful, I thought more about his feelings than mine!|`|h17G3paiaa	Usually it is expected to go vaginally.  The only time they suggest a c section is if you have complications like preeclampsia but they will try to bring on labor before giving c section.      They may also suggest a c section if your baby is breech, i had a friend that was scheduled for a c section because baby was breech, an ultrasound was done a few days before to check if he was still breech but the bugger got into position and my poor friend had to deliver him vaginally

oXzHvsBpaa	Same thing happened to me I was almost 6 weeks and they said that they couldn't find the heart beat. They were able to at 12 weeks. If they tried using a doppler to find the heart beat then yes it was too early. You usally can't hear them on the doppler till about 12 weeks or so. If you haven't had any cramping or bleeding with clots. Then you are fine. Im sure that everything will be fine. It will be amazing though to see your baby for the first time. You should be able to see something. Good Luck! If you hae any questions feel free to add me as a contact.|`|p0prrzf2aa	your cervix are sensitive. tell your bf to be more gentle. you should be fine though. i had brown discharge at like...7 weeks pregnant and it scared me to death so i called the nurse and she said unless I have bright red bleeding and cramping that i should be fine. I'm 9 weeks now (turn 10 weeks on Friday) they tried to hear my babys heartbeat at 8 weeks but couldn't find it either so don't worry!|`|khSCs1rbaa	I spotted twice in week 12 (on Tue & Sat the same week) & went to ER. I had sonograms, heart beat was ok but my placenta was laying low hence causing the light spotting.Currently 26 weeks & placenta moved up when I had the scan at 20 wks.     You cannot detect heart beat using a dopler at 9 weeks. Good luck for the scan & hope it can pick up a healthy heart rate    Congratulations|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	i think you already posted this question, because i already answered it....    its very common to spot while you are pregnant. and also, its too early to hear the heartbeat...you'll hear it in a couple of weeks.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It is common to bleed after sex, and that is throughout pregnancy, not just in the beginning.  As far as an ectopic, you can wipe that off of your list of concerns.  The baby would be way to big by now and you would be dead at 9 weeks with an ectopic.  The pain would've been excruciating.  I think you'll be fine and you should be able to see your little tadpole just fine at your ultrasound.  Sounds like your in the right direction using a midwife as well.  Good luck|`|z7w6xyOKaa	They didn't give you an ultrasound at the ER? When I was around 8 weeks I had some bleeding. It was like bright red but later turned to a brownish color. I immediately went to the ER and they ignored me for a few hours came in did an ultrasound and showed me the baby's little heartbeat told me I was fine and it was normal and sent me home. When I had my first OB appointment a week later he told me that everything was ok and that it is common to have a little bleeding, especially after sex sometimes. Hope this helps and good luck!|`|Coc593Ikaa	1. Don't run to the ER everytime you spot. You'll drive yourself crazy if you do that. Also, spotting after sex is very common as your cervix is highly vascularized at this point. Small capillaries will break when agitated and cause some small harmless bleeding.  2. Symptoms are meaningless in diagnosing whether a pregnancy is still healthy. In a "missed miscarriage", your hormone levels will remain until the fetus is eventually expelled.  3. It is indeed early to hear the heartbeat with a doppler. So not hearing that yet is not concerning. Though I'm sure you are sad about not getting to hear it yet.  4. It is still too early to start showing. However, feeling like your clothes are tight is normal and usually due to bloating. Fun, right?  5. You mean "ectopic" not eptopic. At 9 weeks, you would most likely have had this diagnosed already. The sac is large enough to burst a tube if that is where it is located. Also, has your midwife felt around for your uterus to see if it felt right?  6. Most of us worry about that first ultrasound. Missed miscarriages are terrifying and hard to not worry about. I read questions on here everyday about them. However, please keep in mind that they are much less common than a standard miscarriage. So, if you haven't obviously miscarried with bleeding and pain, then everything is most likely fine.|`|SIrmqu5maa	Girl you are fine! Spotting is normal. As long as its not heavy or painful. If your pregnancy was etopic you would be underground. you would be dead. And since your having all pregnancy symptoms that means your hormone levels are doing great! Still to early for a heart beat. Just enjoy your pregnancy. don't worry so much.
4D1VEKW5aa	No you arent wrong for not inviting her, its your choice to bring who you want and if she wasnt invited she should get over it and stop acting infantile. I took my big sister with me to register cuz she is like my best friend, nobody felt slighted that i didnt invite them also. Also you did say you only picked out the little things, so if theres more to get on there and you have to go again and you want to, invite her to the next time.|`|Nui0BRAEaa	Your choice, they can help with discussions|`|62vCoDPjaa	my mom went with me, my husband wasn't too interested in going either so we went while he was at work. my mil has three other grandkids, and while she is excited- she hasn't offered a whole lot of support in my pregnancy...but my mom has been great...i'm an only child so this is her first grandchild..so my mom is the one that ive asked all the questions to for help|`|2WWEn2mZaa	You should have asked her. She should not have had to explain to you that she wants to be included. After all she is going to be a grandmother every bit as much as your mother. Apologize and ask her to go with next time.
PkWX9Ouwaa	This is the tub we have http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...  Our son is 11 weeks old and we have been using it since his cord fell off.  The sling is good for newborns.  We are still using it but our son will be too big before long.  When they are too big you unhook the lower end of the sling and your baby can sit on a built in seat in the bottom of the tub and still use the head rest to support his head.  Once he doesn't need the headrest you can remove the entire sling and just use the tub.  We love ours and use it for every bath.|`|pXSKSS3daa	It's a waste of money trying to find one you can use for newborn, infant, and toddler stages. You're better off using the kitchen sink or just getting a REALLY cheap tub to use at first.    We used a tub for about 3 months until we finally realized it was a waste of effort. Then we just got a bath sponge our son could lay on in the tub. Then, when he could sit up well, we just sat him up in the tub.    A baby bath tub for a toddler and older infant is kind of impractical.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I bought this one originally:  http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    and while it was nice to have for the first few weeks when we were so nervous bathing him, he outgrew it really quickly.  The last time we used it we could only put like a quarter of an inch of water in it because he displaced so much!    Now I have this one:  http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    and I think that's what I should have bought from the very start.  It's amazing and should grow with him just fine.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Honestly, I doubt you'll use a tub much. I take a bath with my baby every night. We both get cleaned and bond..and there isn't an extra tub getting in the way or needing to be filled, emptied, or cleaned. You can also by a floatie foam pad for the big tub. You'll only use a baby tub til your wee one is sitting up really well anyway. Why waste the money?|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	i got this one for my son    http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...|`|dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	This is the one we bought for our son!! We love it!!   http://www.walmart.com/catalog/detail.gs...  It does have a sling that fits into that you can use when you give your newborn a sponge bath or when they are very little.  We used in on the counter at first then put it in the bath tub once we took the sling out!   Congrats on your little one!!!|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	I haven't got a chance to use it yet cause my baby will not be born til late april but I bought the Primo Eurobath.  I believe its the biggest one out there.  So if u have a regular size bathtub to put it in it MIGHT not fit.  I have a garden tub so I am fine.  I knew it was big but its just what I wanted, I can't wait to use it.  It has no pads or anything on it which I am glad cause I was afraid of having those turn moldy or mildewy, didn't want to mess with that at all. u can use this one from birth to 2yrs and another thing I love about it is its pretty deep, which means the babies body can pretty much be submerged into the water (depending on the amount of water u put in) that way the baby wont get cold.    I had read alot of tub reviews and everyone kept saying how their baby would cry and hate baths but it was probably because it was cold, I'd cry too if I was not in the warm water.  anyway the link is below, check it out.    I can not find this in the stores I ordered mine from toys r us.  :-) if u go to the toys r us link below u can read through the 273 reviews on it, it has a very good rating. again its big but on the Primobaby site they give u an idea on how to store it by hanging on the wall.  that is what I am gonna do :-)    Edit: I just have to come back and add, and I know everyone is different but for me I could NEVER use a kitchen sink to bath a baby, that will just make me puke all over the place that is so nasty.  Justing thinking of our dirty it could be and the fact that u rinse off raw meat in there and everything, ehhhhhh I don't care if it was cloroxed first that is soooo nasty to me I could not do it.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	I spent a huge amount of money on a first steps one that leaked.    My 20 dollar target brand one is perfect.|`|XxRKLyqLaa	sry I have 2 kids and I never had a baby tub   what they were  newborns I used the kitchen sink  with a towl en the bottom and when they out grew the sink they took a normal bath with the sit in seat to keep them in place.    I think that those tubs are just a marketing scam to make us spend more then we need.|`|Xn33r741aa	I bought a tub with my daughter but then when we had our son we never bought one. I am expecting again and will not buy one. You will not use it very often. But if you are set in getting one I would get one that is reasonably priced and doesn't have all the bells and whistles. You will just be paying for the look. If you can get a bath that grows with your baby. Try to get something so you can get the best out of your money.
fHuvS29laa	At 9 weeks I was just beginng to feel like I didn't want to DIE, but the early fatigue was still there hard core...    Between 5-10 weeks I was soo tired I couldn't keep my eyes open through the day, would take a nap and be falling asleep in the middle of a sentence an hour later... And the nausea... OMG... I wanted to die from my "all day sickness"...    I was relieved from most of it around 14 weeks, and felt great by 20 weeks... Now that I am in the final stretch I am feeling run down again (but not like early on).  It gets more difficult to move, and even get comfortable... But I also think you go through so much that by the end the symptoms don't seem like as big a deal as they would if you were hit with them suddenly...    Good luck, love, and health for you and your baby through the pregnancy...|`|p0prrzf2aa	I'm 9 weeks and 5 days :)    i feel miserbarely bloated at night. hungry all the time. tired to the extreme very very ILL. it's unbelieveable but so so so worth it :)))|`|4cehW3S9aa	I am 11 weeks and pregnant with twins.  This is my first pregnancy.    I was really tired at 9 weeks and I am still really tired now.  When I get home from work, I am exhausted.    By 9 weeks, my pants didn't fit anymore and my belly was a little round.  That could also be because I am carrying two.  Nobody else could tell that I am pregnant though.    I was hungry then and I am still always hungry.  I am a tall but very thin girl and I can't get enough food in me.    Congrats on your pregnancy!

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Hi! I had the exact same problem. I had my husband do it for awhile =)  I tried doing it when he was asleep but he still wiggled around and I was afraid I would cut him. I found that doing it while he is eating works best for us. He loves to eat so nothing will distract him from eating, Before long you will be able to do it in your sleep. Good Luck!!!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I tried when he was awake- and I snipped his thumb. I havent done it since then! He will fall asleep on my shoulder or Daddy's shoulder for a nap and we will just tag team and do it then. I havent had the courage to try it while he was awake yet!|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	you could let him fall asleep on you and then cut them. If you only do it once a week that won't get him out of the habit of falling asleep in his crib. Or I put my son facing outward in my lap and take one hand in my left hand and cut each nail with my right hand, but it depends on the baby and how squirmy they are, don't be afraid to get all the way down as long as you make sure you don't have skin in there you want to cut it all the way down so you don't hav eto redo it every 2 or 3 days. You want his hand to be close to your face so you can see exactly what you doing.  But 2 months old seems kinda young to only be sleeping in a crib. I had my son in the bassinet in our room until he was 5 months old and he transitioned just perfectly to his crib when we moved him in there.  I would just roll the bassinet into the living room during the day so I could keep an eye on him. Good luck|`|ZvaFsGvjaa	bite them  it works a lot better and you can kid of make a game out of it lol  sounds kind of weird i guess but it worked for me and everyone else i know who tried it|`|Ogq894zsaa	I cut my sons nails when he is awake and asleep he is 3 months. I just hold onto his hand tight and it helps that they have the gripping reflex so they will hold your hand just be careful and go slow and do in good lighting. And dont do it when your baby is cranky.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	It is difficult.. My hubby would hold my daughters hands and I would cut. It took two of us for such a small little baby :) It gets even harder after the age of one. The best time is when they are sleepy or sleeping.|`|ia7lyDuFaa	My 7 month old will let me cut his nails when he is awake, but only if I make funny noises or sing a song while I do it.

The only thing that I found to help me cut her nails was to feed her while doing it. I mean like have someone else hold her & feed her while I sit there & cut her nails. Otherwise I have to do it when she is sleeping.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I've always cut my son's while he's been awake. He's been pretty calm about it and now just watches as I do it.    If you're afraid of using nail clippers try a nail file. They also make clippers with a magnifying glass on them, those might work. I haven't tired them myself but have heard of other parents using them.|`|AA10390690	i didn't have issues cutting my daughters but i think for quiet a while her nails would just peel off so that made it nice. just grab his hands firmly (not too hard) and cut them one by one.

f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	Its odd that the health visitor isn't taking his crying seriously, yes babies cry, but if he seems to be in pain or discomfort, she needs to be a bit more concerned.  Your his mother, follow your instincts.  Demand to see the doctor.  If they won't help you, go see someone who will. Your baby can't talk, he needs you to do that for him. If your gut is telling you something is wrong, follow that. I've always been right about my boys, when I KNOW something is wrong, I don't give up until I get answers!  Good luck!|`|a4AeNCfiaa	Since you breast feed are you eating anything spicy, gassy etc, it gets passed on in the breast milk even chocolate.So if it effects you it will baby also, I know that the chocolate will give baby a belly ache.  My son was constipated very bad when he was a baby. I had to give him baby suppositories a few times. You just put it in and it will stimulate him to go then you pull it out or it will get pushed out but do not let it melt. If you feel like things are bad enough take baby to ER. that will be a good way to get an appointment it will be a follow up but at least baby would see his doctor.|`|ZvaFsGvjaa	It would be kind of odd if your BREASTFED infant has a problem with bowel movements. I would be more inclined to think he has gas. You can lay him on his back and push his knees up to his chest repeatidly(bent legs) this is supposed to relieve gas. also you can rub his tummy in the "i love you" motion. First you draw an I on his left side of his tummy then an L going across the top of it and down the left side then a U starting on the right side going up then across the top and down the left. and while you do it say "i love you" lol     keep in mind though that babies that age DO need to eat a lot and he could very well be hungry. my daughter pretty much lived on the boob at that age. and also if anyone on here decides to suggest water, only give a tiny tiny ammount. hes getting everything he needs from breastmilk already. small babies who drink too much water can get water intoxication. google it.    the name of the stuff that other girl was thinking of is called gripe water. only give it if you know for sure he has gas. I'm of the opinion that a baby that young doesn't really need anything extra like that except breastmilk though but its obviously up to you|`|LeNeinDUaa	first of all you should not be feeding him ANY WATER - it is dangerous for infants and can quickly cause dehydration and other serious issues. Second, you should also NOT be feeding him any food if it causes wind or not. Lastly, breastfeed him every 2-3 hours or when he is hungry.   and switch doctors.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	It's called Mylicon and it's to help them with gas. It can be given straight and with every feeding.  It really does wonders for my little one. And pushing his knees into his belly as someone said is another great thing you can do to help him out. It's also fun for them. Good luck    The Mylicon drops are safe for newborns so you don't need to worry about that. :)|`|SRK8pJ0Qaa	k first of all it sounds like your health visitor is an idiot. you shouldnt feed your baby whenever he cries. thats not the solution at all. just gonna teach him to eat when hes upset and also make him fat! i would try holding him in a lukewarm bath and massage his tummy. and my daughter was a little constipated when i switched her from breast milk to formula and i was told to give her a little bit of prune juice, by my doctor. i would dilute it though for your baby since he is a little young. hope this helps and also congrats!|`|LDYAGJCxaa	It sounds like he has gas.  I can't remember what it's called, but Walmart carries something for infants to help relieve them of their gas pain.  It's in the pharmacy section with all the infant/children's medicine.  It worked wonders for my friend's baby.  Try calling the Dr again and see if they say it's ok.  Otherwise, talk to the pharmacist and make sure your son is old enough.  I hope he feels better!    ETA:  Holding him in a way that puts slight pressure on his abdomen may help him pass the gas.  If it seems to cause him more pain though, don't do it.      Yes Tiffany!  Mylicon!  :)|`|FvVqFFrNaa	omg, my son did this. its like he would work all day to go poop and then when he went it was soft and right after he would continue grunting and turn all red. i swear he was gonna pop an eye out. i laugh at it now, but he woke himself up at night grunting and then would get frustrated and start crying. i didnt do anything because my pedi said they are just learning how to use their bowels. he doesnt do it anymore and it went away after about 2 weeks (he is 7 weeks now and did it right around 5 weeks too). your son is probably doing the same thing as mine...they dont understand that poop comes when it comes. they think it requires all this effort. its kind of funny if you think about it. but it will pass...give it a couple weeks    also, if his poop is soft he is not constip[ated so dont bother giving him juice or anything.....|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	It may be gas or constipation or both (key question: how often does he do the doo?)  All I can say is: try gripe water for the gas, and baby-size suppositories for the constipation.|`|Kaudz4Msaa	First of all, please do not feed infants water.  You can feed a small amount of chamomile tea, like a few drops, to stimulate digestion.    Also, why are you "staying away from foods that give him wind"...are you changing his foods?  Please, I don't think you should be altering his food at this early age.  I believe you should either feed just formula (one particular kind), or just breastmilk.    But overall, I think some infants go through this phase while their digestive systems are developing.  How often does he poop?    My infant went through this phase, from around 6 weeks to about 10 weeks.  It was torture.  He had colic and always seemed to be uncomfortable.  I was informed that it was completely normal.  The doc said that his intestines were just getting their first use, and they would settle down in a while.  "If they don't settle down by 2 and a half months, then it may be a sign of allergy," he said.  I thought, "but my doctor must be wrong!  my baby is in pain!"  My inclination was to switch formulas, because my doctor had said if it didn't get better we could always try Nutramigen or another "sensitive" formula with hydrolyzed proteins.  But I knew these proteins were experimental, so I didn't do it.  I stuck with my formula and sure enough, it went away.
mxixfE3Raa	There's always a pretty high chance of misscarriage in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy.  There are things you can do to minimise this, but there's still a good chance of misscarriage early in pregnancy.  I've had one misscarraige already when I was 18, and my mother has had 4 all together.  My sister in law is 20 and trying for a baby and all it's resulted in is 3 misscarriages.  I don't mean to scare you, but you need to be prepared that there's always a chance.  I can tell you a few things to minimise this risk and hopefully when you do concieve your pregnancy and baby will be very healthy :)  -Don't smoke.  -Take pregnancy vitamins. (Folic Acid supplements)  -Don't drink.  -Intake the least amount of caffine possible.    I'm going to give you some food guidelines, basically i'm going to tell you a type of food, and what you should avoid within that type.  The foods you should avoid aren't just to reduce the chances of misscarriage but they also reduce the chances of the baby having deformities.    Dairy products to AVOID:    Blue-Veined cheeses, unpasteurized cheeses, unwrapped cheeses from the delacatessen, Soft, mould-ripened cheeses.  Untreated Cows, Goats and sheeps milk, and products made from them. Make sure all milk you drink is pasteurized, steralized or ultra-heat treated (UHT).  Home made ice cream and sorbets cotaining egg white or yolk. Soft-whipped ice cream from ice cream vans or kiosks.  Food containing raw egg such as home made mayonnaise.  Uncooked home made cheesecakes.  Soft boiled or undercooked eggs.  Lightly cooked egg dishes such as tiramisu and creme brulee.      Meat to AVOID:    Raw and undercooked meat including dishes such as steak tartare.  Pre-cooked meat from the delacatessen.  Uncooked cured and smoked meats.  Liver and liver based products.  Raw or undercooked poultry or game.  Raw or undercooked fish.  Shark, swordfish and marlin.  Uncooked smoked fish.  Fish oil supplements.  Shellfish.    AVOID all pate's.    Don't eat unwashed fruit and veg.        After getting to 12 weeks pregnancy you can relax a bit, misscarriage is really rare after 12 weeks.    Caffeine doesn't cause people to misscarry, but the less of it you have, the better your chance of a healthy pregnancy.    Good Luck x|`|CuCrGDuRaa	First, miscarriage is not hereditary.  Also, if you stop drinking caffeine before trying to conceive it will not have any affect on your pregnancy.  My doctor said that miscarriage happens in 1 out of 3 pregnancies and although there are things you can do to help lower your odds, most cannot be prevented.  Good luck and baby dust!|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I don't think you have to stop drinking your mountain dew just limit yourself to one a day.  My doctor says caffeine is fine in moderation.  The most common cause of miscarriage is a genetic abnormality of the fetus and that is something you have no control of.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	It's not hereditary but it is a common thing that can and does happen to alot of women for various reasons. THEY SAY that alot of caffeine should be avoided but you as long as you limit the amount to 1 or 2 cokes a day you will be okay. Caffeine stays in your system until it is urinated out..not long.  IF you M/C it's your bodies way of getting rid of an unhealthy or deformed mass of cells that are not growing properly. therefore it can be a good thing. Sad for you but overall good. There is no such thing as a healthy M/C. Chances + percentage rate are that you will have a healthy baby so don't worry!!!|`|ErcsrWtJaa	For the most part you are worrying yourself over nothing. You do need to cut out the caffeinated sodas.  If you are planning on getting pregnant, start working on making yourself healthier. Drink caffeine free sodas or juice or even better yet drink water.   Take a good multiple vitamin and make sure it has folic acid.   Start eating a good balanced diet and get into an exercise routine...like going for a walk in the evenings.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Early in pregnancy (like before you would find out) there is very little actual blood contact between mother and embryo so even if you were pregnant and didn't know there wouldn't be too much of an effect on the baby. You would definitely want to cut down as soon as you found out. You are allowed to have like 2 servings of caffeinated beverages per day while pregnant (not redbull or energy drinks).     Miscarriage is usually not genetic. Sometimes other conditions that may cause miscarriages are genetic though. Usually these are blood clotting disorders.    If you are trying to get pregnant, I would cut down on the caffeine, just in case!|`|rjVALevtaa	Okay, I don't know where you heard that caffeine causes miscarriage but that is not true. Miscarriage is usually caused by a genetic abnormality. Smoking, drinking, or drug use can also be a cause of miscarriage.     Although you should keep caffeine intake to a minimum if you are pregnant, it will not cause a miscarriage. Nor do miscarriages run in a family.|`|WD6OUUDZaa	they just discovered last year that there IS a link between M/C and caffeine:  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...  that said, i think most M/Cs are just a problem with the baby, so nature just kind of takes its course.   i used to drink one Diet rock Star every day and i was drinking them when i got pregnant so i stopped once i got the positive pregnancy test. i miss my caffeine, but it's so painful to go through a M/C, i don't want to risk it, even if the risk is small!|`|QePbhS8Caa	All I drink is Pepsi, seriously, and occasionally some coffee ... ok, so sometime I sneak in some red kool aide. I am not a healthy eater, I don't take vitamins regularly and quite a few women in my family have had miscarriages. Me? I've had three very healthy babies and no miscarriages.     Tell you what, though. The second I get a positive result I run out and get prenatal vitamins. I always eat healthy during my pregnancies and cut out all caffeine. I pretty much drink nothing but water and the occasional Sprite for heartburn.    I never planned any of my pregnancies, so I never di any prep work, but if you are planning on trying for a baby, you should start acting like your pregnant already. Take prenatal vitamins, cut out/down on caffeine, eat tree healthy meals and snacks in between. Baby Fit: http://babyfit.sparkpeople.com/ is a really great site for staying on track with a healthy pregnancy ... and pre-pregnancy ... and post pregnancy.
QoSZQ8ZWaa	Sounds like your pregnant.  Try another pregnancy test.  It doesn't have to be expensive, as they all test for the same hormone.  The hormone might not have been strong enough to show up when you took the first one.  Even if you are miscarrying the hormone with still be there.  Is is still possible to have a period during pregnancy.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	it sounds like u most deff could be. those are like Straight text book symptoms  go back and get another test to re test maybe it was to early to detect b4   i hope the out comes the one your hoping for|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	I think it is hormone changes.  You missed pills and confused your period.    Have you researched IUDs?    They are really good now and you don't have to confuse your system with those pills.    Ask your doctor about it.    You don't sound pregnant to me, but I am not your doctor.|`|tT4zaIDUaa	I think u could be pregnant!|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Your body is probably doing this because you missed those pills. I don't think you're pregnant. Sorry.
GLS7vgAdaa	when i was pregnant on my birthday we went to the zoo. it was toward the end of the day, not a lot of people milling around. the incredible thing about it was that some of the animals could sense that i was pregnant! the lion especially was awesome. he was sitting away from the fence ignoring the handful of people trying to get his attention. as i walked up, i could see his ears prick up and he slowly went right in front of where i was standing. he then let out a continuous slow growl, staring at me the whole time. i could actually feel the vibration under my feet from it! it was the most incredible experience and a wonderful (and not too expensive) birthday. try it sometime before your baby comes!|`|PfIywLLyaa	Well, you cannot ride a lot of the rides, but in my opinion, the ambiance of Disneyland is sooo worth it just to hang out there! My birthday is Sunday, and I am 28 weeks, and my husband and I are going to the resort where we got married (a four hour drive). It is on the beach and has a great spa which does prenatal massage.    Good luck!|`|DBrNaYNyaa	you can always take a day away from your baby after its old enough, and go to 6flags with your husband! a little fun getaway!!    You can get some friends and go get pizza and have fun! or go bowling if you arent that big/showing by then. or go kareokeing|`|d6dzoHvvaa	My birthday is in April and I will be about 5 months and I was thinking about going to the casino. that would be something fun.|`|bTlhBX3daa	Disneyland will not be the best decision, because you will be limited as to which rides you can go on. At 4 and a half months, you might not be showing and could probably get on whatever rides you want, but any ride that would raise your blood pressure would not be good for your baby.     I suggest having a nice dinner with all of your friends. Maybe you have a close friend who would be willing to host a dinner party. Have fun, play games or watch a movie after.     Just my opinion though. And don't worry, you will get to go to Six Flags again sooner than you think. I'm sure there is a grandma in the picture who would LOVE to take the baby for a day, while you go have fun.
58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	When I started taking my birth control (YAZ) I took it for a whole month before I had unprotected sex just to make sure. You could always call your doctor or pharmacists and ask just to make sure, but I would wait until you have taken the pills for a month and have had a period...better safe than sorry.|`|dGYSLZqjaa	im on the same pill.it starts working after about a week or so.i love this pill.i always know when im gonna have my period and it got rid of my cysts.spotting is normal though a.k.a breakthrough bleeding.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	you need to have been on it for a full month before it's effective.    remember you have to take it at the same time every day for it to work properly...one day of screwing up and you lose your protection|`|msWxxgmaaa	There is a piece of paper that comes with your pills.  It tells you how long you have to be one it before you can rely only on the pills. Mine was 30 days.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	It's normally a week, but we waited 2 to be safe. But the pack should have come with an information booklet, that tells you all that info. Try looking there. You'll get a better answer than on Y!A|`|XxRKLyqLaa	It uaslly takes 1 month or to to really kick in and to be really affective but the pill is not 100% sure     I know by fact that I got pregnate on the pill :S|`|BJuHbQXfaa	I went on the same birth control as you are now my doctor stated that it would take at least a month before you are fully protected. So if you are planning to have intercourse you need to use a back up for the remainder of the time the pill takes affect in your system. Be sure not to skip any days because then your chance of pregnancy increases with just one missed pill. I take mine every night before I go to bed.  Also make sure that while you are the pill that you get regular check ups by your doctor.  Hope this helped.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It depends on the birth control you are taking. It should have come with an insert. Open that up and take a look. Generally anywhere from 1-4wks.|`|723QHuicaa	It depends what sort of birth control it is...    If its the pill, it generally takes 7 days to become active and safe. However, its best to as the dr who prescribed it to be sure.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	It depends on what form of birth control you are on. The shot and ring work right away along with the IUD but the pill can take up to a month before it is fully effective.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Depends on the type but in general a week is safe for most (some are less, some are more).
OP5XqYt1aa	have u tested yet babygirl? x|`|sGJ9mohSaa	it is all the same the color varies just try not to freak out and wait a few days if you don't get your period in another week and a half, get a test. good luck|`|XeGCHjrqaa	Get a pregnancy test done just to be sure ..
9QVjNaIPaa	um, you dont necessarily 'spot' when you get pregnant. some people get implantation bleeding around two weeks after unprotected sex and/or the time their period would normally be due but there isnt a 'set' time frame. the only way you will know if you are pregnant or not is to wait till you miss your period and take a test.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	Hm, I "spotted" on probably the 12th or 13th day after I got pregnant...  it was dark old blood and I thought it was actually my period. Then maybe on the 15th day after conception there was a small spot of bright red/pink blood with a bit of discharge and I was suspicious. The next few days I came to the realization my period probably wasn't coming, so I tested and it was positive!    But keep in mind, brown discharge like that could be from many other things, I've had discharge like that before, even as a virgin, so look for other signs as well such as sore, bigger boobs and slight cramping, etc.|`|18PnBZaEaa	you dont thats not a good sign but u do have normal white discgarge xx|`|OP5XqYt1aa	i have the same agonising wait as you.. the same thing happened to me on mon/tues, so fingers crossed for both of us, good luck xx      thanks babygirl.. babydust2utoo xxx

BUT the things we have said we can't wait for are:  her reaching out/up to us  her saying mama or dada  her walking|`|n6XYYyoLaa	sleep...LOL|`|XOtHsTo0aa	I am a like a new mom again- I have almost 10 y/o twin boys and a 4 month old baby girl.  I can't wait until she says mama and I can't wait until she can start playing with her brothers a little bit.  They love her so much and ask everyday when can she play cars or play with balls with them.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I'm most looking forward to the time when he first reaches out to me.|`|yBt6OoStaa	Well, I'm not a mom yet, I'm 27 weeks with baby  1 - so I'm waiting to hear those words:  you have a healthy little boy!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I think all of those. Ryan hugging me back and hearing mommy are at the top of the list
yVvnZ4hpaa	I started teaching my daughter sign language when she was 3 months old. We used some cards I picked up at Wal-Mart for $1 and a Signing Time video I bought on E-bay (for abour $10).  In less than a week, she understood many of the signs although it took her a little longer to get up the coordination to DO the signs!! Her favorite ones to begin with were milk, more, and mommy! She is 5 months now and recognizes over 40 signs. She's not deaf, but sign language is proven to up your baby's IQ if taught withing the first 3 years of life. Have fun!|`|3oGRNQKyaa	are u deaf or him? or one of u cant speak?  bcoz that depends on what u teach and how..|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	If you go to Babies R us they have some basic sign laguage books. I am doing this with my son and he know about 5 signs and he is almost one. I haven't been very consistent with it though and that is the key. Baby Sign Laguage Basics is a good one but you can just look through the book section and see which one you prefer.|`|6W6B26sgaa	My cousin is deaf and she's the oldest of two other girls, both of which were more fluent at sign language than actually speaking by five. If you just make the sign for drink when giving a drink and make your child do the sign with their hand (mold their hand into making the sign) and just repeatedly do that whenever you give your child a drink (same with other things, of course) then it will condition them into making the sign when they need it. =) good luck.|`|a64598a37268806d2197c8547e7cef5daa	There's a woman who taught her little one to sign while she was learning to speak and she wrote an article I'll post in sources. If you already know signs, use them when you're talking to your baby and teaching words.    The second link is a website that has video clips of different signs.    Your local library will have books on sign language that will probably be helpful as well.     Hope that helps.

However your baby will be at risk of all the side effects from formula.    Also the less you breastfeed the more at risk you are of many diseases.    Its a no brainer, just stop taking the pill and nurse on demand and your supply will come back within days.    http://www.kellymom.com/newman/14more_mo...  6. Breastmilk given with formula may cause problems for the baby.    Not true! Most breastfeeding mothers do not need to use formula and when problems arise that seem to require artificial milk, often the problems can be resolved without resorting to formula. However, when the baby may require formula, there is no reason that breastmilk and formula cannot be given together.    http://www.health-e-learning.com/article...  infant formula should not be given to a breastfed baby before gut closure occurs  o once dietary supplementation begins, the bacterial profile of breastfed  infants resembles that of formula-fed infants in which bifidobacteria are  no longer dominant and the development of obligate anaerobic bacterial  populations occurs (Mackie, Sghir, Gaskins, 1999)  o relatively small amounts of formula supplementation of breastfed infants  (one supplement per 24 hours) will result in shifts from a breastfed to a  formula-fed gut flora pattern (Bullen, Tearle, Stewart, 1977)  o the introduction of solid food to the breastfed infant causes a major  perturbation in the gut ecosystem, with a rapid rise in the number of  enterobacteria and enterococci, followed by a progressive colonization by  bacteroides, clostridia, and anaerobic streptococci (Stark & Lee, 1982)  o with the introduction of supplementary formula, the gut flora in a  breastfed baby becomes almost indistinguishable from normal adult flora  within 24 hours (Gerstley, Howell, Nagel, 1932)  o if breast milk were again given exclusively, it would take 2-4 weeks for  the intestinal environment to return again to a state favoring the grampositive  flora (Brown & Bosworth, 1922; Gerstley, Howell, Nagel, 1932)    in susceptible families, breastfed babies can be sensitized to cows milk protein  by the giving of just one bottle, (inadvertent supplementation, unnecessary  supplementation, or planned supplements), in the newborn nursery during the first  three days of life (Host, Husby, Osterballe, 1988; Host, 1991)  o infants at high risk of developing atopic disease has been calculated at  37% if one parent has atopic disease, 62-85% if both parents are affected  and dependant on whether the parents have similar or dissimilar clinical  disease, and those infants showing elevated levels of IgE in cord blood  irrespective of family history (Chandra, 2000)  o in breastfed infants at risk, hypoallergenic formulas can be used to  supplement breastfeeding; solid foods should not be introduced until 6  months of age, dairy products delayed until 1 year of age, and the mother  should consider eliminating peanuts, tree nuts, cows milk, eggs, and fish  from her diet (AAP, 2000)    in susceptible families, early exposure to cows milk proteins can increase the risk  of the infant or child developing insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)  (Mayer et al, 1988; Karjalainen, et al, 1992)      http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...   It's important to note that the feel of the breast, the behavior of your baby, the frequency of nursing, the sensation of let-down, or the amount you pump are not valid ways to determine if you have enough milk for your baby.    What if you're not quite sure about baby's current weight gain (perhaps baby hasn't had a weight check lately)? If baby is having an adequate number of wet and dirty diapers then the following things do NOT mean that you have a low milk supply:        * Your baby nurses frequently. Breastmilk is digested quickly (usually in 1.5-2 hours), so breastfed babies need to eat more often than formula-fed babies. Many babies have a strong need to suck. Also, babies often need continuous contact with mom in order to feel secure. All these things are normal, and you cannot spoil your baby by meeting these needs.      * Your baby suddenly increases the frequency and/or length of nursings. This is often a growth spurt. The baby nurses more (this usually lasts a few days to a week), which increases your milk supply. Don't offer baby supplements when this happens: supplementing will inform your body that the baby doesn't need the extra milk, and your supply will drop.      * Your baby nurses more often and is fussy in the evening.      * Your baby doesn't nurse as long as she did previously. As babies get older and better at nursing, they become more efficient at extracting milk.      * Your baby is fussy. Many babies have a fussy time of day - often in the evening. Some babies are fussy much of the time. This can have many reasons, and sometimes the fussiness goes away before you find the re|`|deAyKj2Uaa	yes, it is perfectly okay.  many women do both.  it is not going to harm your child one bit.  you might consider a breast pump, that way you can try to pump and bottle it, but it is common to stop producing breast milk when you start taking birth control again.  you might consider talking with your child pediatrician about which formula they might recommend.|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Absolutely! I gave my son breast milk and formula till he was 6 months old. I wasn't producing enough milk either so I would pump and he would get formula every other time (this seemed to help his tummy cuz I think the breast milk was easier on him than the formula which sometimes made him cranky the first few months)  PLus I think it is easier on their system if they are't getting breast milk all night and formula b/c the formula can give them tummy aches until they get used to it. But my doctor actually reccommended I "supplement" with formula if he wasn't getting enough of my milk. Really what else are you to do, let him go hungry? :) Good Luck|`|SRK8pJ0Qaa	try giving her a bit more of breast milk first if you have any left over. when you supplement feed with formula it is going to decrease your milk supply and so will being on most birth controls. dont take anything over the counter that is supposed to increase your breast milk unless you get a double ok from your doctor. anything you intake can pass to your baby through your breast milk.  remember, your body is on a supply and demand schedule. the less you pump or feed the less milk your body will produce. you demand less everytime you feed formula to your baby. you should look into a pump for when you are away from baby and when she is eating formula|`|rAkWoweOaa	I did. Now he is on all formula.|`|e4SflIigaa	I Don't see why not.. Do formula during the day and give breast milk at night..|`|QT5ROElraa	yes, but drinking from a bottle is less work for her, so she might just want to switch altogether soon. You might want to ask your Dr. I bet they can give you something to bring back up your milk supply. If not there are somethings you can take from a health food store.|`|wFfeayBMaa	You should not be taking regular birth control pills while breastfeeding because it decreases milk supply. You should take a progesterone-only pill (the "mini pill"), the depo-provera shot, an iud, or a barrier method.   To answer your other question, you certainly can supplement with formula. I do. Ask your pediatrician to recommend a formula.|`|c73QkZ2haa	This is a personal choice but you should try looking at options to increase your supply before going to formula. Talk to a lactation consultant and see if you can get some help. If you decide to give the formula make sure it is in a breast friendly bottle(natural shape like Playtex avent or those special ones http://www.adiri.com/products_html/natur...   shaped like a boob. so you can still bf without nipple confusion.|`|a4AeNCfiaa	You can but the bowel movements will be different. with breast milk they should resemble watery mustard and with formula I remember it being darker. And there is also a good chance baby will prefer bottle to breast after awhile. Check with doctor or try to pump when baby is not feeding it will keep your supply up and you can freeze it for up to a year.|`|k0TDCEFEaa	Yeah but you mines well just switch to formula .|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	I stopped taking the mini-pill for the same exact reason. My LC told me it was the reason and I decided I need to breastfeed more than I need birth control. If you really want to use formula, then go ahead, but if you want to continue breastfeeding, stop the pill now, get on both fenugreek and blessed thistle and feed constantly. It will come back. As for birth control, look up how to read your body's signs and don't have sex when you see them.

I introduced one around 7 months but have just now started putting his formula into them and he'll be 10 months old next week.    For just introducing it you can put small amounts of water into it and let her play around with it at this age. No worries about her actually drinking her meals from it, though.|`|rjVALevtaa	I have that book too. I don't think you read that section fully, it isn't talking about weaning the baby from her bottle at 5 months. It's talking about introducing a sippy cup for water and juice.     Although you can wait until she turns 1 year old, I must tell you that introducing the cup that late may make it extremely difficult. A 5 or 6 month old baby is generally more open to trying something new. Whereas, a 1 year-old is likely to be more set in her ways and reject the cup.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Wow, I see that. My son is four months as well and I can't imagine that yet.|`|e7ZptEpDaa	i dont think it means to wean your baby from bottle to sippy, it just says to start introducing the cup to see how your baby reacts to it and so your baby has 6-7 months of using a sippy to get used to it before you wean her.|`|wFfeayBMaa	Water or juice should be offered in a cup. Milk still comes from a bottle. I wouldn't give her a cup unless she can sit up on her own and she doesn't need water or juice yet. That's weird, I actually just pulled out my copy and it does say that. I would wait until water and/or juice has been introduced.|`|BY3kFyr7aa	I breastfeed my 5 1/2 month old son and when I started weaning him 5 weeks ago I introduced water in a sippy cup everyday also (seeing as he wanted nothing to do with a bottle) it took him 2 weeks to accept it and he now gets excited everytime he sees it coming, he can hold it and put it in his mouth but he just cant tip it up at the right angle yet so I have to give him a little helping hand!  So I would def recommend giving it a go it may be easier than you think :)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Sippy cups have huge handles and are easier to hold. I weaned my baby from the bottle at 12 months but I did start her on the sippy cup at 5 months. She didn't get it till months later.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i doubt they mean to wean at five mos, just to introduce it to let them practice and get used to it...i introduced one when my dd started solids, but that is the only time she uses it; she only has one she will even try to drink from, bc it has no valve; all the rest she won't even try so far....but she still gets all her bottles and will keep getting them..|`|DNygQdmVaa	I have that book and I dont think it means wean them off the bottle at 5 months but just get them use to using a sippy cup for a few months before weaning them.    I tried giving my son a sippie cup that young he refused until he was about 8 months.
9p9DDRSnaa	1. The swing is nice for about the first 6 months maybe.  I would skip the walker and get the Bright Starts Around-We-Go..heres a link to it:  http://www.thisnext.com/item/92640C61/50...  This is the best thing we could have ever hoped for and trust me on this...it is a Godsend!  My daughter actually started walking before crawling because of it.  The seat can be detached too so it grows with them.  The bouncey seat is alright but get one that can travel with you.  We really didn't use it all that much because we had the swing. But if you get one, the vibrating bouncey chair worked the best as the vibrations were soothing to her.  2. If you have two cars then go for it  3. I didn't register for these things but I have an older sister with three kids of her own who handed all that stuff down to me.  It is relatively inexpensive to buy those as well, so I would get some other stuff.  P.S.  If this is your first child, I would suggest a foam pad for your sink.  bathing your child in the bath tub is hard on the back and knees.  It is much easier to use the sink.  We got a baby tub but it was more of a pain in the butt...it was hard and looked really uncomfortable...I always felt like I needed to keep one hand on her so she didnt roll.  We bought a $1 foam pad (baby section at WalMart) and put a beach towel in the sink....this worked perfectly for us and cuddled her better than the tub...my daughter is 15 months now and she still uses it to sit on in the sink....best of luck!|`|AA12057835	1.Register for the swing and a walker (or an exersaucer).  One for now, one for later when the baby gets bigger.  2.Yes you do need both, you need the infant seat and the convertible seat for sure.  The stroller is a judgement call on you if you plan to go to a lot of places with your baby.  I have a travel system, and the stroller is great in the summer.  3. I did not register for anything listed on your  3.  I figured those things were cheap enough for me to buy.    You can register for a few new outfits, but it's not necessary.  People LOVE to buy baby clothes.  It's just something about how tiny and cute they are.  I got a ton of hand-me-downs too....and got more new than used clothes for my son to wear.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Oh, heck, yeah, what strikes your fancy,  think of all different budgets, and baby's ages  as well,    For some the bouncy seats etc, are too much,|`|LgtKz6Emaa	I'd register anyway for all of that, even though he/she won't be using it right away. The time really flies and they'll be using it before you know it! Better to get those things than a bunch of things you can't use after a month or two....and no it isn't wrong to register for new outfits either, he/she needs her own things too, even though hand-me-downs are nice. I'd get a carseat that's up to 22 lbs (6ish months) and then another one for the next size. And a walker and swing are both necessary lol, especially when they really want to start to be entertained.     Good luck!! :)|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	yes we registered for almost everything. we did not do the potty chair but we did everything for about a yr of age. the car seat depends on you we got the car seat combo but will need something when he grows up. I like the combo cause its cheaper to come with the stroller carrier and seat base. i did register for a certain kind of sippy cup and bottles that I wanted.     No its not wrong to put cloths on the registery even tho you got alot of hand me downs. You do want a few new outfits. PLUS the babies going home outfit should be a cute new one. GL and have fun.|`|siDcjgJCaa	1. Graco makes a 3in1 swing. the seat comes off to be a bouncy seat.. it worked great for us! My mom got a walker to use at her house when the baby was a few months old.. she loves it.     2. We also got both.. if you have two cars it comes in handy to habe both    3. I register for a few spoons, bowls cups... but not much.. and no, i did not register for a potty...     Good luck.|`|Ou3N06oYaa	1. Yes to all three items. Babies needs vary according to age and development. The swing is good for 5 months and under. gives you a free hand. Bouncy seat good when they can hold their neck up which is after 5-6 months. They can entertain themselves with the multitude of toys a bouncy chair has by turning themselves. Walker enables baby to practice and provides balance. walking varies with each baby - i'd as early as 10 months.  2. yes. Click in infant baby seat only works up to x  pounds or length. THese are ideal b/c you can just carry them from car to stroller without removing and waking them up. After they outgrow it you need a car seat which stays in your car (no click in function). There are some fanct smancy expensive ones that do all but they are generally over $1K. In the worst case scenario you can always get store credit for unwanted gift.  3.It helps to have items with different price points so giver can have some choice. Spoons can be used around 6months so I think your items are reasonable.    I think it's okay to register for new clothes even though you really don't need them. It 's nice to have at least a couple new pieces for the baby. Keep in mind though that babies outgrow very very fast though. However if you think your in law would be offended or upset you should probably just give her a heads up and explain it's your first so you want to spoil the baby a little bit with new clothes ( but make sure to let her know that you are very thankful of the clothes and will definately use them. also mention that you are very fortunate to have such a thoughful and generous sisterinlaw - believe me i asked mine for some and she just changed the subject and gave it away to someone else)    good luck with the baby!|`|qKnE08Rxaa	1. Swing - It depends on your baby. My baby liked swing for a little bit. I bought it used for $20 so it was not bad. Some people do not like the idea of using swings to help baby to sleep but I say, every baby's different.     Bouncy seat - We have baby bjorn - best item ever! I still use it when I feed baby solid food. My baby hated other types of bouncy seat.     Walker - I do not have walker yet. I'd like to get it when my baby needs it(she's 7 month old). I do not know which works best for my baby yet. She loves her Jumperoo.      2. We have Bugaboo & a infant car seat plus the car seat adaptor. My baby hated the infant car seat so I really feel like switching to a convertable car seat right now. Convertable car seat stays in the car so you don't need carseat travel system. The nice thing about infant car seat is that you don't need to wake up your baby in order to move baby from car to a car seat.       3. If you find feeding items you'd like to purchase, do register the items. Though, there are so many new baby items coming out all the time, you might see something better. Just save all the receipt so you can exchange later if you change your mind.     4. I had so many clothes handed down to my daughter so I did not even think of getting more. Though, my hubby & I purchased few really pretty clothes for our baby girl because we thought she needed some new clothes from us. I you'd like more clothes, register them!|`|yB5go5wbaa	For my shower, my mom told me to register for everything, because the worst that's going to happen is that you're not going to get it...and this way, people will have lots of options when they go in the store.    I would register for both car seats, especially if the convertible one can go up past 20 pounds (that's usually about how much the infant car seat can hold with travel systems), and then you won't have to worry about it when the time comes.    I registered for older baby stuff too.  As for the clothes thing, I didn't register for anything except things like onesies packs...and we got a TON of clothes.  People will get you those anyways, along with other things because they're relatively inexpensive!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Register for everything you want. If you get two of the same item you can always exchange it. At Target you get coupons in the mail for things you registered for that were not bought, so put everything on there.  We did not get a walker for our son, and he did fine without it. We had a swing and a bouncy seat and got a lot of use out of both. But, if you were going to pick one I would say the swing would be better.  I would just get the convertible car seat and not the travel system. I have a travel system and don't like it. My son outgrew the carseat it came with before he was a year old and the stroller is so big it's hard to take it in the mall and move it through the racks. I would get the convertible seat and a lightweight stroller.|`|Bw18seFqaa	1.  My baby is only 3 weeks, and I havent found a need for these items, yet.. they may be nice in the next few weeks tho as she gets older..  she wont need a walker yet tho until she's able to hold herself up..  I didnt register for those items because I picked them up at a garage sale...  some of these items that are used for a short time are easy to pick up a gently used one.  You will want to register for a playpen if you havent.. those are harder to find, as people generally use them longer.    2.  Its nice to have an extra car seat.. one for each car.  The convertable carseat may be handy when your baby gets a little bigger too.    3.  Yes I registered for small cheap items too.. even if it was something I wouldnt need right away.. not everyone can afford more expensive items like car seats and play pens..  so I had a lot of small cheap things like that too.    nothing wrong with asking for a few new items of clothing, expecially if you see something you really like..  people do generally give clothes anyways.
LSYTl1kYaa	First and foremost- you and your kids are the most important thing. im sorry to hear about your boyfriend and his family, but you are a mother to those kids and you need to do whats best for you three.    if you think you can make more money then you are now, besides having to move around a lot in FL. id go for it. you'd only be moving around a lot, for a short time until you got enough money to get a place for you and the kids.    i know its probably tough, you want your kids around their father, especially since he's sick, but you need to let him know that this is best for both of you. that you can make the trip up to see his grandmother asap, once you both are settled down there. its not the end of the world if you move away. at least ask him for a chance,for one shot to see if it works out and if not, you'll move back and go back to what you've been doing.he cant argue then.    good luck hun.    p.s id apply to a few places around there as well, incase the nursing home deal falls through, you never know what could happen.|`|rZEjYkMxaa	I don't know, it was distracting to read something that had sooooo many grammar mistakes.

Those are my favorite names, very unique but still nice.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Your suspicions maybe correct. Implantation occurs 6-10dpo and you get light pink/brown spotting on and off for a few days.  Your symptoms do sound like early pregnancy ones.    Your best to check the day you miss your next period, try not to get your hopes up too much, as some woman can take a fair few months to fall pregnant again, but some can fall pregnant 1st try.    You should be able to test now if you think you had implantation on the 9th Jan.  Best of luck and i hope you get the results you want xxx
oyvOSYx9aa	I personally agree with you, I wouldn't even have pets while I have a baby or young child. Our children should come before animals. If the child hurt the dog the dog could turn- it's not worth the risk.|`|22aE3SCBaa	Depends what the dog is like and the history it has. For example, I have a spaniel who wouldn't hurt a fly, is a complete wuss, and likes humans more than other dogs. I would be totally comfortable with him being around a baby, especially if no one had got him worked up, because he's so calm and sweet.|`|d6dzoHvvaa	haven't you heard that a dogs mouth is cleaner then a humans? You need to allow the dog to be comfortable with the new baby. They can sense a new baby in the house.|`|GpR5MI5raa	its kind of gross, but its good to do to let the dog get used to the baby. it stops their curiosity|`|xrfpL6AIaa	I agree with you 110%

My youngest was like that and he had what they call pyloric stenosis.If your unsure of anything call your doctor or take child to ER.As far as I know it is not good for a child that young not to have gone to the bathroom in 6hrs.I'm not trying to scare you,but it is better to be safe then sorry.|`|AaP7o0Ufaa	It's so easy to get yourself all worked up!  I bet every hour seems like 10.  It could also be possible that she went a little - since she only has a little in her & that your absorbent diapers hid the evidence.  Have you tried Pedialyte?  I haven't used it myself, but I've heard when they can't keep anything down, it's a life saver!  Good luck to you & try to keep her in your arms & your mind occupied!

796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	Honestly, I don't think any of these shows are appropriate for an 11 year old and definitely don't fit your criteria.     Secret Life of the American Teenager -  This show is about a 15 year old girl who gets pregnant from a one night stand with the school "player". The same boy is dating one girl and sleeping with another. They usually have sex at least once an episode. Although they never show the sex they talk about it very openly and will show the evidence of them being in bed together undressed. I must also mention that the same boy was sexually abused by his father who just recently reappeared in the show. The show goes over all of this in a way an 11 year old shouldn't witness. This show is actually geared to mid to older teens and young adults.     The City and The Hills -   This show features young women who are old enough to drink and do so in almost every episode. The show follows their relationships with friends and boyfriends so there is a lot of drama and plenty of sex to go around. Again, they don't show direct sex but there is a lot of sexual tension between several people in each show. There is also a couple who had a fake wedding who go through very adult issues in their relationship. None of this is appropriate for an 11 year old.    The Bachelor -   This show is a match making "hook up" show. It's a man who gets to pick who he wants from a large group of women. The women get nasty and very competitive and of course they swear. There is a great deal of sexual tension and make out sessions. Honestly, I think it's over her age range. This show is aimed at adults who want to watch the fantasy of being romanced by a rich man. Not really for an 11 year old girl.    Greek -  I've never seen this show but I know it's aimed at older teenagers and young adults. I know the cast are college students (hence the name - it's about fraternities and sororities) which means drama, sex and parties.     I know these are the shows she wants but I really don't recommend them for her to watch. She won't be happy but sometimes she just can't have her way.     Here's a site thats aimed at parents to help them find appropriate shows and movies for their kids. I hope this helps. http://www.commonsensemedia.org/    Brit|`|69bp1IMfaa	She should watch more history and nat geo programs, not crap that caters to couchpotatoes eating junk food.|`|nL9EuQ2eaa	well there are a lot of disney shows coming out soon that are very funny and she would really enjoy|`|SxHvknWMaa	I don't think any of the shows you had listed are appropriate for an 11yo.

Edit: What about Drake and Josh and other Nickelodeon shows that are a little less babyish than Disney but not too grown up.    Blushing (above me):  You go!

vfFwkUKSaa	don't worry gurl, i come over and help you find it.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You're probably getting ready to lose your mucus plug. It should be a good bit of blood tinged mucus when it comes out. Doesn't sound like it's happened just yet.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	It was probably just discharge. I always joked with my fellow pregnant ladies about all the juicyness down there. The mucus plug is thick, clear and looks like a wad of snot. Sometimes a big chuck comes out and then you'll continue to have the slippery clear stuff for a while. It's totally gross but you should be able to tell the difference when it's your plug. From here on out you'll probably have all kinds of stuff going on down there and it's nothing to be concerned about unless there is bleeding, pain or other symptoms. Sorry your ob isn't being very nice. Hopefully she'll be in a better mood for the delivery. Good luck!|`|qi6mAsCZaa	It could be, but it is ok. It's common to gradually lose your mucus plug. When you DO lose it, it could still be weeks before you go into labor. As long as it is not blood tinged before 36 weeks, everything should be fine. If you start feeling steady contractions, you should call your doctor back. When I lost my mucus plug with my son, it was a dark brown color. I was about 37 weeks then and I went into labor a week later, but you could still have weeks before it is time.    I hope this helped! Good luck and congrats!
AA11170799	Well, have you asked your son what he wants to do? If you don't want to invite the whole class, you can invite just the boys. If you do invite the whole class, only half are likely to come. The 'etiquette' books will tell you to invite 7 kids (one for every year of life, + one)  Here is a description of the 6 year old birthday parties that my daughter went to (so you get an idea of the range):  -rented bounce house in back yard, @8 guests and their parents (only family friends, none from school), pizza  -bounce house, invited all the girls in class, only 4 came + cousins  -invited 3 girls from class, no parents, only cake, pizza and gifts  -invited 1 girl from class, no parents, roller skating  -invited all girls from class and family, 6 came, food, games, etc    My daughter's birthday is in the summer, so set up a big kiddie pool in the back and invited 10 of her closest friends and their families. We ended up spending $200 easily on food, cake and decorations.|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	Honestly a party at home is cheaper and can be a lot of fun.  Either that or cut down on the number of kids invited.  Make it a boys only party.  That should cut down on the cost.  Also, you could have the party at a local park and organize games and let them play on playground equipment.  This option would be cheap.|`|ZMsMo8Uoaa	I would just invite a few friends to the house to play and provide activities. My son's birthday is in April and we always throw a BBQ (it is my and my dad's birthday as well that week). We buy the kids those poppers that you throw at the ground and water guns. They have a blast running around the yard chasing eachother and being kids. It's real casual and then everyone eats lunch, has cake and ice cream, open presents, etc. Loot bags are optional and the kids get to keep the water guns too ha ha.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	They cost that much when you have them at outside businesses because you have to cover the cost of admission, of the extra employee, of basic business overhead, plus, of course, a profit for the business.     If you don't want to pay that much, then have a do it yourself party at a park or at your home.  IME, the kids don't really care where the party is - they have just as much fun if they're just 'playing' as if they are playing somewhere expensive.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	First, it will be less then 20 children    When you invite, not everyone comes  Not every one RSVP  Some shows up without RSVP    For 20 children between 200 and 300    You can look into build a bear  The party stars at ten dollars(bear only)  You can save money  When you book the party, buy a gift certified  When you do, you will get a bear points, and will send you money off  When you paid for the party, use the gift card, and uses you coupon for the bear points  You will get more bear points  This can save you up to 50 dollars(most around 30)    It's the only place that will give you money back from buying a  gift card to pay for your party.|`|gxqawyxUaa	I think that it would be fun for all of the kids to come to your house and play there. You can get some balloons, games, and kid foods (mac and cheese, chicken tenders, etc.)  Set a limit for the amount of kids you can handle and let your son choose his closest friends he would want there.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	I think you should invite the whole class because it's unfair to invite some and not all. It could hurt some one's feeling. Thousands of schools don't allow kids to send birthday invites out in class because it's rude and unfair.    I would chose bowling because it will probably be cheaper. If it's not cheaper, pick McDonald's. So the kids can run and play :)

Q8tf4B5taa	Cervical Mucous Monitoring  Another method for determining when ovulation occurs is through the cervical mucous monitoring test. This is the only method that will not require looking back to the past few cycles to analyze. It is based on examining the mucous that is normally secreted from the cervix in order to determine where the woman is in her cycle. The consistency changes during the cycle due to hormonal fluctuations. The key to this test is that the woman will actually have to get a sample of her cervical secretions (from the outer lips of her external genitalia) and stretch it between 2 of her fingers (the thumb and index finger) to test for the consistency.    Before Ovulation (low chance of pregnancy):The first few days following menstruation, there will be little or no discharge present. The woman should feel dryness around her vulva. During this time, she is usually not able to conceive.    Approaching Ovulation (chance of pregnancy):The first discharge that does appear should be moist or sticky and should be white or cream in color. In the finger test, the mucous should break easily. She will only be able to pull her fingers about 1 cm apart before it breaks. During this transition time, first the mucous will become cloudy and slightly stretchy during the finger test (this means that it will still break before the fingers are stretched all the way). As time progresses, the mucous will become greater in volume.    Right around ovulation (high chance of pregnancy): At this stage, mucous resembles egg whites. It is the thinnest, clearest and most abundant at this point in the cycle. Finger testing will allow the mucous to stretch quite a ways (several centimeters) before it breaks (if it breaks at all). ) The amount of this thin mucous will steadily increase until she experiences her 'mucous peak'. This is the last day of this period where the chance of conception is high. It is closely tied to ovulation. It is often only recognized in rertrospect. During this phase, the sperm's survival rate is higher. It can survive in cervical mucous for up to 72 hours, a significantly longer time than during the rest of the cycle.    After Ovulation (low chance of pregnancy): After ovulation, there is a marked change in mucous appearance. It returns to the sticky stage (does not stretch during finger test) and there is again a feeling of dryness around the vulva.    One caveat for this test is that sperm can be confused with the mucous secretions and the woman could make wrong assumptions. Also, vaginal infections, medication, and birth control can alter conditions and should be taken into consideration when examining any vaginal secretions.    Mucous can be easier to retrieve after bearing down (like she is going to have a bowel movement) or after exercising.|`|vgD95DLCaa	Call your dr if you are still getting negative and haven't had a period in 2 months. The test you are taking could be wrong.

You could consider the names Brianne, Madison, or Lindsay for the girl's middle name. Good luck =)|`|jiXQ8eDFaa	Jack is a good, solid name, and it's classic without being boring.

In my opinion, Erica was a little overused in the 80's. :\|`|6d39cdfc85c0782ae65dd77a5d1401e2aa	i think erica works, but try some other names for the boy, maybe adam, or evan???
Lx5vYz9jaa	It's probably a yeast infection.  She should get over the counter medicine to treat it and if it doesn't go away within a week, then she needs to get tested for STD's if she's sexually active or it could be a little more severe of a bacteria infection that needs a prescription.  No need to panic, women get these all the time.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	I don't know but it sounds nasty    It could be thrush|`|wiAVa1H5aa	A bacterial infection a la STDs or PID.

AA11783622	Safe sex.... in medical terms that means that you are on the pill, an implant, a shot, an IUD, a diaphragm, AND he is using a condom and spermicidal gel.    So, hon, did you indeed have safe sex??????  or just your version of it?????    If you are not on the pill etc, and he did not used the above stuff, you are at some risk of disease, and a pregnancy.... and unhappily you are the result of 8 years of Republican government that does not want you to know how to protect yourself, if you have used any public clinic.  (It wasn't always this way.......)  If you went to Planned Parenthood, you're fine.    And as an aside, now PUBLIC clinic are forced to tell you how to protect yourself.... IF you ask....IF   .. one of the benefits of George no longer being our president....'nuther issue, but write if you wish to know why this was this way for 8 years.    In a way, I can't answer your question, because your definition and THE definition of safe sex may not be the same.    Again, write if you need to.... I'll be here another hour or so.|`|AA11304279	safe sex doesn't always mean no pregnant. you could very well be pregnant tender boobs are a sign of it. the most effect way is to get a home pregnancy test if you miss your period. just treat yourself for the waiting period as if you were and tell your partner your concerns.|`|MqFeJiukaa	If you are using protection you are prob just getting ready to start your period.  Nothing is 100% effective but the chances of you being pregnant if you are using protection 100% of the time is really slim.  All you can really do is wait and see if your period comes.  If it is late then go buy a home pregnancy test.|`|EULVtVDvaa	Your probably pmsing - if your practicing safe sex you should be ok . Don't stress :)
yhpR2gNiaa	I had a baby at 34 weeks, she got to come home a little after 2 weeks.   She weighed in at- 4lbs and 14oz  Her biggest problem was breathing. She also needed a little help with feeding. She got over the eating problem pretty quickly, a took a little longer with her breathing though.    She turned out fine. She is a healthy 7 month old who is doing new things every day.|`|i69nprxXaa	I had my daughter at 32 wks because I had toxcemia and she had to be delivered. She was healthy weighing in at 3pds 1.2 oz 15in she had to stay in the hospital for 30 days only to get her weight up. My due date was September 16th I had her on July the 15th and took her home at the end of August.. Hope this helped. Good Luck to you!!!!|`|4t2z2X77aa	I delivered a healthy boy at 34 weeks.  I had a high risk pregnancy from the very beginning. I was then put on bed rest at 23 weeks. Two days into my 33rd week, my water broke.  They admitted me but wanted me to hold out until 34 weeks. They put me on IV antibiotics to prevent infection and planned on induction the morning i turned 34 weeks.  The baby however had another plan. At about 3 am going into my 34th week, i woke up very ill. The doctors had to do an emergency c section (i had planned on a vaginal delivery).  The baby was immediately brought to the NICU where they checked him out and he was fine, just small but at 5 lb he was big for a preemie. He was put in a less serious nursery and he remained there for 3 weeks. The only problem he really had was he hadn't yet developed the artful form of sucking so he had to take most of his milk via tube.  This is normal i was told for that age as they develop this skill in utero around the 34-35th week.  Once he got the hang of it he was able to come home. It is a very stressful experience, having your baby in the hospital and you being home. Our hospital was great though. Just know that the baby is in good hands there.They didn't mind that i spent most time there. When he was discharged he had already gained more than a full pound
Wnmg850Paa	I like Arabella. I think it sounds very pretty and it means  miracle.|`|Vx8p9rIIaa	definitely scarlett or shailene.  antionette is a girl's name that i went to highschool with (nickname: toni) and everyone always for all those years whenever someone met her they were like toni? are you serious?  arabella just isn't a pretty name, what would you call her? bella?  and what grown woman wants to be called bella?  massie sounds like a nickname. but shailene is very pretty and maybe you could call her shae? and scarlett is just beautiful and classic.  good luck. im sorry if i came off as rude.. i really didnt mean to!|`|MhZvYb8Baa	Massie sounds like she stepped out of the Clique Books. Arabella is automatically going to get turned into bella once school starts. I'm a fan of Antoinette, i love it!|`|CabbrCKiaa	Scarlett is beautiful!|`|nFakIvgoaa	I like Arabella; if you like nicknames, you can call her Bella; if you don't like nicknames, however, that might be a point against it.    Whatever you decide; congratulations on your baby girl!|`|P2UHQQehaa	I LOVE scarlett (it's classy, unusual, but def not weird). your baby girl will love it! good luck!|`|IvkNTqDMaa	Scarlett...very pretty. I just don't really care for the other names...Massie reminds me of Lassie(the dog).|`|cpM8GQ5Yaa	Beautiful and french origin.  Go for this name.

Honestly, you don't want your daughter to get teased.|`|1GuMLF2oaa	i prefer arabella for you. us too.. still looking for a baby girl name.|`|yNz8Hn4Caa	shailene is nice. it reminds me of the beach. antoinette sounds like an old person. scarlett, no offense, and i do like the name, but it just kinda sounds like a whore. massie sounds like a fat person. arabella is nice also, sounds like a dancer|`|J6TmcHgDaa	I like Scarlet and Arabella.  Good luck!|`|TwsFrzuzaa	I love Scarlett  its a sophisticated name, people with that name, are smart, beautiful individuals.  I see your baby fitting well with that name!|`|o9tRjCMhaa	Go for Scarlett!
AA11348933	Yes, I got all kinds of dumb comments.  People seem to think that a Pregnant women actually WANTS to hear those things.  It doesn't end when you've given birth either.      I had this lady come up to me while I was holding my baby (who has red-hair) and she proceeds to tell me about her non-redheaded grandchild getting badly sunburned in April.  She went on and on about it. and described in grotesque detail how bad her burn was.  I just kind of nodded and walked away from her.  What's up with that?|`|oyvOSYx9aa	I guess they just see your baby bump and start thinking about their pregnancy. They want to tell you how lucky you are that's all- totally harmless. They are not trying to make you uncomfortable, they are probably just trying to make conversation with you.|`|Worr8ZQOaa	You are incredibly insensitive|`|AA11327039	Same question; same answer    Sounds like someone needs to go on bed rest.    They just want someone to relate to. A kind word or two, "Gee, I'm so sorry" would be helpful to those going through such sad times.|`|hWc65sEtaa	I'm sorry they must have not realized you weren't a compassionate person.|`|VzOokYEqaa	hahah i know what you mean! I had so many people give me tips on how to raise my daughter, finally i snapped and told this lady "Yeah I didn't ask... Im gonna do it my way". dumb bit*h didn't even have kids.
aLAmvX5Naa	6 weeks is a bit young. Before 6 months I would just play with your baby at home. If you join a moms group or whatever, at this point it would only be for your benefit.    Once your baby turns 6 months they do have swim classes and Gymboree classes and what not. From my experience Gymboree is a waste of money before your child can sit up on their own. The big thrill of the class is crawling around the big toys in the gym and playing the parachute. If all your baby can do is lay there they would be far more stimulated at home looking at mom.    Once you hit 12 months and your baby can walk they offer baby gymnastics and dance and stuff like that.    If you are lonely, join a moms group. But do it for you, your baby will get nothing out of it at this age.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Sign up for parents as teachers. Every school district has it for free. They offer free classes such as baby sign, happiest baby on the block, and infant massage. They also have play groups and special events from time to time. Check yahoo groups and meetup.com for other moms in your area. I found a great play group that way.    http://www.parentsasteachers.org/site/pp...    Also check your community center for mom and baby yoga classes. Most offer them for babies that aren't mobile yet.|`|Run7dyraaa	Classes? At 6 wks old? How about graduating from college by the time he's 12? Why don't you put some pressure on the kid? Relax. Enjoy him.|`|LMDCm6kuaa	I recommend Gymboree Play & Learn classes. They're for newborns ages 0-6 months, so it will be perfect for your child's age.    Plus, you'll be able to meet moms that you can befriend, and share tips, tricks & experiences. They'll be great for play dates in the future!    If you like that class, feel free to explore others. The Music 1 class is a great choice once your child turns 6 months.    Good luck - they are definitely worth the money. I don't have kids of my own yet, but I'm a daycare provider, and I've heard great things.|`|GnFCTnRCaa	There is probably a swimming class that you can take your baby to where you take him in the water and do activities with him. Usually called something like baby and me, or water time, or something. Just ask your local community center that has a pool. When I was 6 weeks old, I was in swimming lessons with my mom.
G2auAv1Saa	Don't react to her tantrums, you or your older daughter. Once she realizes they don't phase you she will stop them on her own.   Since the dollar for the vending machine is important to her, use it as a reward not as an every Friday thing. If she can go the week without having a tantrum then she gets the dollar otherwise she has to try again for next week. Make a chart with the days of the week and every morning if she behaved well the day before let her check it off, once she has 7 check marks then she gets the dollar.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Maybe she's right...|`|7rb2F3TJaa	She is trying to manipulate you into getting what she wants by embarrassing you annoying you and making you mad. Do not under any circumstance give her what she wants if she is going to act like that.  The next time she does, take her home immediately and spank her.  Lol i know about this i used to be that way to my mother.    Oh and I used to be able to throw up on will when I was a kid too.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	You have spoiled her enough it seems. Just keep your word, when you once say no, don't say yes even if she is threatening to jump from a chair or something high, just put something soft under it. She must know that you are her mother and the last person she must insult. Let her cry, she is may be used that when she cries she gets what she wants. Forbid sweets, or make her go to bed without dinner, she must know that you are not "for granted" and will be good whatever stupidities she does. Do something now, or I don't want to imagine what kind if a teen ager you'll have    Good luck|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Well the first thin is that I seriously advise you to challenge the school on even having a vending machine like that! My friend did..they had a coke machine in a primary school! To have things like that for sale is an unhealthy temptation for kids...there will always be some kids who get a dollar every day and it is not fair to temp them...write a letter or speak to the PTA about it.  As for her behaviour I suggest a pints/star system...where she gains rewards for being good and looses points every time she shouts or is bad.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	As the saying goes, "Momma don't take no mess" Weather it be in terms of kids acting up, or men acting up haha.  Just ignore her melt downs. And time out, one minute for each year of her age. So five minutes.  Don't give the tantrums a reaction, she will soon wear herself out.  When she goes into melt down, simply say, if you can't use your words to talk to me, then we aren't going to get anywhere are we, after all I don't speak, shouting.|`|xk5XK6CPaa	Um well im not a parent but im realllyyy good with kids.           She needs more attention. Give her some more attention but when she starts throwing a fit stop. and tell her to stop crying now or else she wont get to continue doing something with you w.e tht is.         Help and get her active so she has soemthing fun to do. and let her know if she isnt good she cant do tht sport or acivity anymore. Such as dance, gymnastics, ect. Something fun.         Your doing fine. All little kids will go thru a face and say they hate you, dont worry. its normal. Show disciplen in her and dont let her become a spoiled brat. Wich ur not.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	She might need exercise time after sitting all day at school.  All that pent up energy makes a lot of kids hard to handle.  Stick with what you are doing and make sure she runs and plays outside after school.  Maybe you could join the Y.    Giving in is not the answer.  Kids all tell their parents they hate them and the rules at some point.  Don't worry about that.  You could send her to her room for being little snot, but that probably wouldn't help matters.|`|AA10531094	Put your foot down and let her know that she's not to speak to you like that and she's not always going to get her way.  Parents today give in to their childrens demands and they're left wondering why they can't control them.  Good Luck!|`|AbCeEZIhaa	What are the repercussions for her at home when she throws these little fits? If she was that way at both places it would be one thing, but she is not. At school, she knows the rules and has also learned or by watching other students not to cross them or how far she can push. At home, all bets are off. She gets some sort of reward from you or her sister (attention) or her dad. Figure out her motivation, from the 5 year old perspective, and you will figure out how to deal with her.|`|4DoXomHZaa	She is doing this to you because you have not given punishments harsh enough for her to realize it isn't worth it. Youve been letting her get away with it.    I personally think a pop on the butt for this RIDICULOUS behavior (throwing up??!! that is really....histrionic...unhealthy)is appropriate, maybe you don't......in that case, stop giving her vending machine money for several weeks. Take away TV privuiledges.     When she comes home, "banish" her to her room. Tell her it's obvious she doesn't want to be part of the family, so until she does, she won't be. Don't let her have any toys or tv when she's in there.    My mother would put her face very close to mine and hold onto my head so i HAD to look her in the eye. Then she'd repeat what I said..."I'm the worst mommy ever? You hate me? So you want me to go away forever? Never see me again?" Then she'd (and everyone else) would ignore me completely for a while, not even answer me....I learned that terrible behavior was not appreciated and no kid likes to be isolated.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	whoop her butt|`|r5AbT6tmaa	Sounds like my 5 year old daughter.. maybe it's normal after all. I think that just because she's having a meltdown doesn't mean she needs to be disciplined. As long as she's not hurting herself or anyone else she should be allowed to vent. No offensive words though. Just talk her through it and tell her that you understand she's frustrated. Promise her the ice cream for the next day and just get the sugar-free kind. A bit of flexibility on our part goes a long way and the kid feels that we are listening.|`|aavNyOeyaa	to be frank, spank her. But first unplug all the phones, because my niece called the police on my sister and her husband.|`|o2YScQFOaa	take her to a consoler. not a shrink but just to see whats up. and dont be afraid to stand up to her and say no. dont give in. just let her figure out that your the boss and she is the child. maybe you can do a point systym and if shes is good all week your fammily can get icecream or go to a movie. or the park or somthing|`|KBKbCoc9aa	talk to her teachers at school and find out what they do at school. and talk to the teacher about this problem. maybe you can find the answer there. thats pretty messed up. sounds like she maybe trying to be like a fellow student she looks up to. Dont you just hate peer pressure.|`|awRNr2VMaa	when she does that send her to her room. if she wants the money that bad she will understand. My dad used to always tell me and my sister good girls get bad girls dont. I would tell her she wont get the money on friday either. if she throws a fit tell her to go to throw the fit in her room because you dont want to hear it. it will show you mean business. do you give in alot? are you too easy on her? if so she knows it and you need to crack down the law. i dont think spanking would be a good punishment for that because taking the money will teach her to respect you and then sending her to her room will show punishment and that you arent going to give in and she doesnt need to throw a fit because its not going to work.|`|AA11170799	Is she throwing that kind of tantrum because you or your 7 yr old or your husband sometimes gives in to her? This is what I would try: If she asks to go get ice cream, give her a real answer, with an explanation (like "We're not going today because we need to get home in time for X, but let's plan on going on Friday after school"). If she asks for her $1, ask what she wants to get from the machine. Maybe you could tell her, ok, you can have it, but you don't get another one on Friday.|`|skWN7jWHaa	If you find the answer please tell me this sounds like my 6 year old..I feel for you!|`|AA11305127	I have found that responding to bad behavior increases it in children. When my kids were young, I would let them scream, cry, whatever, then calmly ask them if they were done.  Don't react to her bad behavior and it will go away or at the least, slow down. Children respond to how their parents react. Let her know that she won't get you angry when she acts that way. Calmly deal with her tantrums. I don't believe in hitting children. I talk to them instead. She is 5, not too young to reason with and not too old to be punished for misbehaving.  Sit her in a chair where she has to think about what she is demanding and explain it to you later when she calms down. Don't cater to her demands or let your older daughter try to calm her down.  That only enforces her position as the "alpha" child. You are the parent and as such the one who is charged with teaching her how to behave. It takes a lot to keep yourself calm, but trust me, it will decrease when she realizes she can't get the best of you.  Good luck.|`|SpcYCBndaa	Be consistent in your methods of discipline and how you punish your child. This applies to all caregivers. Your child should learn to understand that there are predictable consequences for his actions.       Think ahead. Be prepared for what you are going to do and say to help your child understand the consequences of his actions. Don't just wing it, or do or say the first thing that pops into your head. You are more likely to react negatively if you haven't thought out your plan for discipline beforehand.       Set up a daily routine for your younger children and try and stick to it each day. This should include mealtimes, snacks, bath and bedtime.   Provide a safe environment that encourages exploration, but protects your child. For example, you can prevent your toddler from getting in trouble for opening drawers and cabinets if you have safety locks preventing them from opening.         Set limits that are appropriate for your child's age and developmental level. Remember that you are in charge and that you will have to say no' to your child sometimes. You should expect your child to cry when he does not get his way. This is a normal way of dealing with frustration in younger children and should be ignored. You should also ignore temper tantrums.       Do not offer choices in situations where you child has to cooperate with your rules. For example, instead of saying do you want to take a bath?' you should instead say it is time for your bath.'       Don't give in to your child when he is whining, crying or having a temper tantrum. If you do, it will only teach him that this kind of behavior is an appropriate way to get what he wants.       Learn to ignore minor, harmless or unimportant misbehaviors, such as fidgeting.       Make punishments and rewards immediate. Avoid waiting more than a few minutes to provide the consequences of a behavior.         Avoid repeating commands. You should give a command and if not followed, then you can repeat it once with a warning of what the consequences for noncompliance will be. If not followed, then apply the consequences. Do not continue to repeat the command.         Don't argue with your child about the punishment. Ignore any protests. You can talk about it later.       Plan ahead. If you always have difficulty in certain situations, such as shopping or having visitors, go over a plan of action beforehand, which includes what your expectations are and what the consequences of misbehavior will be.       Be flexible, especially with older children and adolescents. Listen and get your child's input on some rules and punishment.       Use I' messages, instead of you' messages. For example, say I am upset that you didn't clean up your room,' instead of You made me upset for not cleaning up.' You' statements can seem more accusatory and can lead to arguing.         After disciplining your child, briefly explain the rule and what your expectations are when he misbehaves and explain what the proper behavior would have been.
ZvaFsGvjaa	any of them WILL work  if you want top quality ones though go to the health food store and ask the people who work there. they are more expencive though.  and get capsuls instead of solid pills. they break down in your body better|`|F8iyUqJBaa	My baby turns 1 this week and I am still nursing him too, I am 23 weeks pregnant and after doing a lot of research and talking to a midwife I don't take the regular prenatal anymore I take super blue green algae, also known as spirulina.

They are over the counter|`|e4SflIigaa	I take pre-care premier my doctor suggested i take them 1 year before i wanna start trying and all throughout my pregnancy and 1 year after giving birth because I was severly anemic and just don't eat right so I needed them..
7KHMepStaa	Maybe a food allergy?  If she's on regular formula or milk, possibly it's has something to do with the milk.  I'd have her ask the doctor if she should try putting her on a soy formula or soy milk.|`|AA11210211	I agree with Kashi,my daughter was born 2 1/2 weeks early and only weighed 4.5 she will be 1 on the 31st well a couple weeks ago we tried some new foods and something gave her a rash and diarrhea,she also lost 1 1/2 lbs,we cut out all the solid foods and then went through then to see what was causing it and we did,she has now gained her weight back and the rash and diarrhea is gone so I think it may be an allergy.|`|44OH7Si6aa	What is her diet? Not so much with how much she is eating but what she is eating. My 5 year old and 2 year old were born at normal weights but have been considered underweight ever since. They have difficulties with their digestive system and can get very easily constipated or get diarrhea. They are mildly lactose intolerant due to their native american heritage, and I have to monitor all of their sugar intake because too much sugar will lead to days of diarhea with them. The vast majority of what they eat is all vegetables because they aren't crazy about meats and too much fruit is the same as too much sugar. They are still shorter and lighter than other kids their age but their doctor has been very happy with their growth.|`|wNRjFjLEaa	Please don't ask us take her the baby to the doctor.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	It sounds like allergies, or a digestive disorder like celiac's disease.    A fat free diet is very dangerous for babies.  I'm not sure what you can do without proper testing?    PS Sausages, pancakes, and fish crackers are junk food.      http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t081500...  TOP FOUR CAUSES OF DIARRHEA       1. Intestinal infections  most of these are not serious, not treatable, and will resolve on their own with time:              * Rotavirus  one of the most common causes of diarrhea, especially during late fall and winter months. It causes very foul smelling, watery, green or brown diarrhea that can persist for weeks. Fever and vomiting are common at the onset of the illness.            * Other viruses  there are a variety of these, none of which are serious.            * Bacteria  these include E. Coli, Salmonella, and several others. Vomiting and fever may be present at the onset. Blood in the diarrhea is a common finding with bacterial infections. Even these infections rarely require antibiotic treatment.            * Parasites  there are a variety of these. They are usually caught from contaminated water (e.g. Giardia) or during travel to foreign countries. The telltale sign of a parasite is very watery diarrhea that lasts beyond two weeks.            * CONTAGIOUS  these are all generally contagious as long as the diarrhea continues.        2. Food intolerance or sensitivity  your child may simply be eating something that is difficult for his intestines to digest. These foods vary from person to person.              * Lactose intolerance  this is the most common example of food intolerance. Symptoms include gassy pain, stomach cramps, nausea, and diarrhea after eating dairy products (which contain the sugar, lactose).            * Sugar or chemical additives and coloring  these have been known to upset some little ones' intestines.        3. Food allergy  there are many signs of food allergies, and mucusy, sometimes bloody, diarrhea is one of them. It is different from food intolerance in that the allergic symptoms affect several parts of the body  intestines, skin, respiratory.              * Milk protein allergy  this is an example of one of the most common food allergies. Your child may start to develop diarrhea, rash on the face, body, and diaper area, runny nose, cough, or wheezing. Notice that here the child is allergic to the protein in dairy products, where as with the dairy intolerance above, his intestines have a difficult time digesting the milk sugar, lactose.        4. Normal intestinal variations  as discussed above, your child may simply be going through a normal phase of loose stools. It may be related to a change in diet, but doesn't always mean there is an allergy or intolerance.
P1VoMS36aa	oh yeah,this is not at all uncommon.  i have 4 and all of them would scream the place down when i left,but its just because they love you and don't want to be with anyone except you.  give her a few days she will adjust and realise other ppl are fun too.  honestly she will be fine she just loves you- you must be a great mum !   xxxxx|`|Ogq894zsaa	I run a in home daycare and have this problem with all of the new kids. It takes about 3 weeks for a child to feel fully comfortable in the daycare and settle down. And over time the crying will stop and eventually be nothing and soon they will be happy when they realize where they are going!|`|d816a2e753cd875d3a4b2d6f66e43948aa	Maybe she isn't being held as much there as she is at home. As you probably well know, babies like to be held, but at a Daycare they don't really have time to hold just one baby. My sister ran into the same problem, so she opted for a nanny instead who was able to focus all of her attention on the baby rather than having to worry about 20 other kids. I don't know if that helped but that's just what i think may be happening.
n3h9Byhpaa	-You could move in with a friend.  -You could runaway.  -I know in some states you can legally move out when you're seventeen! (What I'm hoping to do ;p)  -Get a job/ after school activities to keep you busy and spend less time at home|`|sq9AtIRHaa	Aww that sucks I'm sorry. I felt the same way at 15; when I was pregnant and all I got was bullsh*t from my parents. Life is a tough journey. Try to stay strong! Hmm maybe go to a friends house and see if you can stay there for a few days, and have your grandma clean up your act. I really suggest a counselor also. Good luck; hang in there!??|`|i2yM0T9Paa	You can emancipate yourself. But you have to have your grandma's permission. Otherwise, you will have to wait until your 18. You could run away, but I wouldn't suggest it cause they will find you and you will get in a lot of trouble.
eP729T0Qaa	I was on provera two times and both times I got my period 2 days after my last pill. It lasted about 5-7 days and it really wasn't too bad. I had heavy periods before it though, so maybe that's why it didn't seem as bad. It should be gone before he comes home! Good luck!|`|pW3G1onIaa	i'v been taking provera since nov 08   the first round i took me a whole week to get my period  from the last pill  and i lasted a whole week  i was surprised that i had no major cramping i was expecting the worst     in dec it came on day 6 after the last pill  and it was for 5 days     and this mth it came down on the 2nd day from the last pill     so i think its a little unpredictable      you should be ok :)|`|5axGfFofaa	I got my period 7 days after stopped provera and it lasted 7 days but was light at the end.  This was a longer than usual cycle for me.
ryvO8DMaaa	Like most everybody else said....no it isn't 100% that she HAS to have another c-section but most people that have had a c-section end up having another one with the next baby and so on.    I too wanted a vaginal delivery and was heartbroken when my doctor told me there was a huge possibility that I would end up with a c-section.  So I would say at least educate yourself on c-sections so you know what to expect just in case and remember you are no less of a woman if you end up having one.  Both a vaginal delivery and a c-section end with the same result....a beautiful baby.    Good luck to you!|`|F2JEvYX7aa	Usually the doctor will do another c-section if the person had one already, there are a lot more risks if she were to try to do it the natural way, but some doctors will make the person try and still only use the c-section as a last result.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Many doctors will not carry the slightly higher risks associated with vaginal birth after c-section (VBAC)...she could very easily find a doctor who would.    I am with you...against c-sections except in cases of emergency...so many risks, so many more potential complications..it's not natural, and Mother Nature knows what she's doing.    I think many women simply are afraid of pain, or stretching/tearing, or want to plan a date...get all impatient and a bit selfish and take that road.|`|zATQaiwIaa	Usually a doctor will advise you to have a c-section for additional births if you had one previous bc you can tear things - stitching can really only do so much.    Your friend was telling the truth.   I delivered my first vaginal and plan on the same for this one; currently 31+ weeks - and i wouldnt have it any other way.  I do not judge those that have not delivered vaginally though - just wanted to make that clear!|`|TZ4mbFh3aa	Unless the doc thinks that it is better for her to have a section, than that is best!  She could have a VBAC(vaginal birth after csection)...I had a csection in November and still get pains every once in a while.  I really wish I could have had a vaginal birth, but for the safety of my baby I had to have the section.  You dont HAVE to have a section the second time unless you are ordered to by your doc.|`|06qlDIrdaa	My sister had three children via c-section. Her hips were too close together so the babies head would have gotten stuck if she tried to deliver vaginal with the first child, and because she had one c-section she had to have the others the same way. She wanted to do it the natural way but she was glad that she had a c-section. I don't think your friend is being selfish, and I wouldn't pass judgement on her by thinking that she is. She has no choice and she is happy about being pregnant and experiencing it again. You should support her and be happy for her because she may be upset she can't have a vaginal delivery secretly.     Congratulations to both of you on your babies!|`|MqFeJiukaa	Most of the time if you had a previous c-section then you have to have a c-section for all your future pregnancies.  Yes there is a VBAC but there is risk involved and many drs don't feel comfortable with the risk.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	if she already had one she has to have another.  Shes missing out on the easiest way. Plus its the quickest way to bounce back to life!|`|vgD95DLCaa	She's not lying, but every dr is different with this issue. My SIL had 1st with c-section, and next 2 vaginally. It all depends on your Dr.     Personally I had a myomectomy and dr said I must have a c-section and I don't want one.|`|h17G3paiaa	I had a c section with my first child.  I wanted to deliver vaginally with my second but my doctor at the time would not allow it.  It all depends on her situation with her first c section.  If the dr doesn't have enough info about the 1st c section, why it was needed, etc then the dr will just give a c section.    Honestly, i felt nothing with my 1st c section and was kind of happy that i could just pick a day to have my baby but when i had the 2nd one, it was awful.  I could feel (no pain) all the pressure the second time around, it was pretty creepy and that is why I am not having anymore kids!|`|oXCo6VX4aa	There is no law in the US that states you would have to have a c-section the 2nd time if you had it the first.  If the dr is saying that, it is probably a hospital policy.  Whether she is lying or not, I don't know.  Many ob's don't give their patients all of the options unfortunately so she really may be going by what the dr said.    Many women have a vaginal birth after a c-section.  It depends on the kind of incision you had the first time, why you had the section the first time, how it healed and if the pregnancy is high-risk or not (among many other things).    Good for you on the vaginal birth, there are so many reasons that vaginal is better for you and the baby!  Stick to your guns, it's really easy to get pushed into something you don't want with the way that the hospitals in this country are set up.  Make sure your partner (or whoever is with you) knows what you want so they can be your back up and you won't have to worry about it too much while you're delivering. :)  Good Luck!
s4LWmcTjaa	I've breast fed both my kids and my breasts are not saggy and deflated :)  They aren't as elastic and full, but they are still perky!    Any ruining of your breasts will take place during pregnancy, not once you start breast feeding.    And as one user states:  Sagging breasts are inevitable.  It will happen one day.|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Personally, I have more important things to worry about than whether or not my breasts are saggy or if they are different than what they were before my pregnancy. I am breastfeeding for my daughter's benefit. I breast fed her exclusively for the first six months because it is the best thing I could ever do. Any side effects (I don't know of any negative ones) for me, are just an added bonus.    They're not as full now as we only nurse a few times a day, for about 15 minutes at a time. I'm wearing a pre-pregnancy bra and some days, I don't even wear a bra under my camisoles, especially if I'm likely to stay home. (They have the bra panels that help hide the nipples poking out and if I wear one of my corduroy shirts, then nothing shows.)    My husband still thinks my breasts are my greatest physical feature, especially after seeing them nourish our daughter.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Nope your fine and your baby is healthy for it. As for later on in life it's called gravity and you either live with it or start saving for your local plastic surgeon.|`|IHjevhjhaa	Its gonna happen either way. Your breast are still gonna engourge themselves and then they'll be left a lil saggy than before. Who cares really, you just had a baby!|`|XntSwYezaa	they sag if you don't wear a good supportive bra. So just wear a good bra and you will not have a problem..|`|prqrQcd1aa	I've breast fed 3 children, no it doesn't make them defated and saggy. I am 27 they are not as full as they once were, but they are still fine with me! And this is after feeding 3 kids, not one. You will be fine!|`|8VJwoGXKaa	My doctor insists that pregnancy itself changes your breasts, not breast feeding.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	if you care about your child it shouldn't matter. but pregnancy makes them sag when you're 60, not breast feeding. but again, sagging is inevidable :/|`|Rd3IivxCaa	for the price you'll pay for diapers over the next 2 to 3 years, you can get boob implants.    I hope that puts things nicely in perspective.|`|sIQzny5Taa	No both my doctor and all the pregnancy books I've read say that breastfeeding doesn't harm your breasts at all, in fact the only thing that does affect your breasts is the pregnancy. After that, breastfeeding will not cause your breasts to become saggy. The only thing that will cause that is if you don't wear a supportive bra during pregnancy and nursing and beyond. But don't worry that's a complete myth! Good luck!|`|5DJcir9saa	Pregnancy is what changes your breasts, not breastfeeding.  They get full when your pregnant in preparation to feed your baby and then "deflate" once you're done breastfeeding.  If you don't breastfeed, they are still going to go back to your original size, once the milk stops producing.  And anything that gets bigger and then smaller is going to look different especially if it happens more than once.|`|AA11988604	we'll need some photos to give you an accurate response|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I totally understand how you care about your body. I love my flat abs & after having my baby girl, c-section, it looks horrible. I feel horrible whenever I look at my tummy because I was always very athletic & nice figured person. I hate giving myself up for my baby & looking bad too.     But, what are we going to do? If you can, breastfeed your baby. It is really good for your baby. Some people don't have milk so they cannot breastfeed even though they want to. I heard breastfeeding don't make your breast saggy. If you really don't like the outcome, visit plastic surgeon. I hate surgical procedures but I'm just telling you some options. You can get your breast back but not your baby's health back.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	I don't get formula being convenient.. LOL! But then I ebf, and never had to worry about not having her food ready or bottles.. *shrug* Anyways, as many said, it's pregnancy not bfing that causes the changes in your breasts. Also, to the person who said oh, you're still bfing.. not me! Been done for almost a year and my boobs are actually full again (had deflated a bit while my daughter was weaning herself) and a full cup size bigger than they were pre-preg. :-) Don't be jealous that I have awesome cleavage. LOL!|`|tFKiZWTPaa	breastfeed your baby! my god. you have a kid, stop thinking about saggy boobs and give your kid what he/she needs!|`|mvHs43Ldaa	No breastfeeding won't make them saggy. I've been breastfeeding for 7 months now and they are pretty much the same as they were before. They actually changed a little but that was before I even had my baby!|`|MN9dNcyuaa	Not if you do it correctly. I breastfeed and my husband loves my breast even more he says they are bigger and has a special glow that he cant resist squeezeing them.|`|AaP7o0Ufaa	I breastfed my son for 6 months & my breasts are exactly the same as before.  I also used to be overweight years before having him, so they were a bit deflated from the git-go.  I don't know how much that helps, but mine are in the same (not perfect though) condition as before hand.  A friend of mine breastfed her daughter (who is now 6) years back & she has a great rack!  I hope that helps!  I would really encourage it.  Before having him, I thought I'll try it because it's the best thing for him - but really I don't know - it seems just weird & I don't know if I'll feel comfortable.  It was the best thing I ever did.  I loved breastfeeding!  I wish I'd have done it longer though, because he was NEVER sick while I was breastfeeding & then I quit & he started daycare, and he catches colds, has a runny nose, etc.  It's worth it for so many reasons!|`|U4R0XLa0aa	Well, you should be more worry about your baby's health than your looks. Even though you don't breastfeed your baby, your  breast is going to change. You should feed him and do some exercise to tone your breast.|`|nNRMOITEaa	maybe but Hunny age wil make them sag eventually i've breastfeeding for 71/2 months and mine aren't as they use to be but it's all about the bra u wear it has to support you well go to victoria's secret so they can properly fit you for a bra but most likely they wont be the same there will be days where your like damn my boobs are sexy and then days where your like ughh i hate my boobs because of the milk when there full of course you look hot but right after baby feeds it sucks but forget that BREAST IS BEST my son is so healthy and to everybody he looks a a months or 2 older than he is i love it's a great bond|`|u12eVaDhaa	Hi, what happens to breasts is that pregnancy has the effect, NOT breastfeeding, as you have found already.  The Relaxin hormone that allows our bodies to expand during pregnancy also relaxes the breast tissue and causes sagging.  However because they're full in preparation for breastfeeding and then ready for action as soon as you've given birth, you don't NOTICE the sagging until after the milk / colostrum (if you never feed) goes away.  HENCE the reason EVERYONE thinks breastfeeding makes your breasts sag, but it doesn't. pregnancy does.      Have a look at some of the websites below for some really intersesting insights into newborns and breastfeeding, especially Dr Jack Newman's Kangaroo Care - it's amazing!!!    Check out:  www.drjacknewman.com  www.kellymom.com  www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk  www.llli.org    Best wishes whatever your decision.|`|6hA0O06xaa	For those of you who answered that they are breastfeeding and have full perky boobs, of course you do because they are full of milk and you are still breastfeeding!  Mine are too.  It's after you wean that they become saggy pancakes.  But I'd rather have saggy boobs than a baby with constant ear infections and the smell of formula spit-up throughout my house.|`|AXEqOEloaa	No it will not make them saggy, I nursed one son when I was 18 the other at 32 and plan to nurse my third son due in June. My breasts are still cute and perky ;).   But always remember every pregnancy and everybody is different.|`|87f8699fae346ba5d63a2c44b54e0151aa	It's pregnancy (and age), not breastfeeding that can make your breasts saggy. Don't take anyone's "experience" on this point - there are actual scientific studies that prove it.|`|yiqGZUNnaa	Pregnancy usually involves hormonal and weight changes. These hormonal and weight changes are the culprits to your saggy breasts, not breastfeeding. Just go ahead breastfeeding your baby because that is the beauty of being a woman and mother that functions well. You'll get healthy babies plus you'll lose more weight and prevent breasts cancer. You've got nothing to lose...:)|`|OsOuo6Qaaa	I asked the very same question years ago before my son was born and got mostly answers like the ones you are recieving now. I know exactly how you feel though, the thought of sagging breasts are very depressing and although it is great and bennificial for your child, the act of knowing you did the best for your baby doesn't add any self esteem or pride to what your breasts could look like. Having a baby is a beautiful thing but it can do some absolutely devestating things to the body which leaves us ashamed and depressed & helpless. I know because i have felt this way ever since the birth of my son.    I am however proud for giving my son the best health and benifits of breastfeeding but wish i could have given it without ruining the only thing i was ever happy about with my body. I know it sounds selfish but this is how i feel.    I used to have full D breasts and after 2 years of breast feeding i noticed they have drooped and after weaning 3 and a half weeks ago they now have an empty deflated look. I'm only 22 so i am very unhappy with what they look like now and i simply cannot afford any type of breast lift or augumentation, none of that.    I Weaned my son at 2, at the beginning of January and since the milk ducts have gone and most of the milk has dried up, my skin has become loose & wrinkled and my upper breast on my chest has completely flattened.     I was a D before i got pregnant now a saggy double D. I Have read that after the milk ducts shrink, fat will start to slowly restore itself in the breasts but all i can do it wait and hope.    Whilst pregnant, the milk ducts in your breasts enlarge as your body readies itself for the baby, causing your breasts to expand. After ceasing breast feeding or not breast feeding at all the ducts will shrink back causing possible sagginess & excess skin. However i STRONGLY don't believe a woman who chooses not to breast feed or simply can't breastfeed will end up with the same extent of sagging and stretched out skin as a woman who has breastfed for a long period of time. Some people recommend Vitamin E or cocoa butter to firm skin up but i have tried after weaning and have not noticed much difference. I do think that doctors are bias towards breastfeeding & that's why they simply claim that sagginess is enevitable during pregnancy and breastfeeding will not cause sagging. Yes, pregnancy could contribute to sagging but how can they say breastfeeding does not? During breastfeeding the milk ducts are constantly expanding and shrinking and this is the main cause of excess skin and stretching.    To be honest i think that breast feeding for a long time has made my breasts this saggy. If i had not breast fed i think my breasts would have been perkier because my milk ducts wouldn't have been stretched out for such a long period of time.         I wish you all the best and the best for your baby. I know i will get some negativity for my response but i wish somebody would have shared their personal experience without all the sugar coating & criticism.     Of course everybody has different experiences & you could be one of the lucky women who just bounces back.     Here is an article on breastfeeding and how a surgeon concluded that it does NOTcause sagging if you are interested in reading (although i am not convinced!)    http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...          all the best in whatever decision you make and the best of health to you & baby xo
tFvTW9CXaa	On the martertiny leave in Texas is called FMLA, "Family Medical Leave Act" this is granted to a FT employee after completing a full year of employment with at least 1250 hours worked. FMLA only covers your time off it does not pay your time... FMLA will just protect your job meaning you will be back to the same/similar position and pay. As far as getting paid for your time off, I would recommend you look into "STD" meaning Short Term Disability...this is what will pay your time off. Some companies offer it some don't. If your company does not offer STD then I would consider buying STD Insurace on your own or via Afflak or something rather....     I know it seems like it will be alot to take and it will change your life, but please don't think for a minute that you should get rid of your baby! It's a little angel and yours, take care of it. Once you know your baby is here, you will want to work extra harder for him/her to provide all they will need.|`|AA10976444	I am in BC...yes you do qualify for mat leave if you have 600 hours at the current job.  Its 17 weeks mat leave, and 33 weeks parental leave for a total of 50 weeks.  You qualify for 55% of your wage to a total of $420 per week.  Look on the govermnent website www.hrsdc.gc.ca and it will give youall the information that you need.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Anytime you have sex, you should not consider pregnancy "unexpected"....sex is DESIGNED to make babies and no bc is 100%    So...there really is only one clear option. The other two are completely unthinkable. You elected to take the step of risking pregnancy with your bf, and it happened. Now you step up and be the very best parents you can be, young or not, to this child the two of you created. Could you really imagine destroying the offspring of the man you love? That's pretty unnatural when you really think of it.    You will have to sacrifice your own material wants and live frugally. It's not what you make, it's what you spend. No, the timing is not ideal, but you rolled the dice, now pay the price.|`|phAqOpzZaa	this time of the yr will be hard to raise a baby...but you guys can save...i mean come on your both adults and working save up the money until the baby is almost born around 9mths...dont leave your parents house...until the baby is born...so you can have a place and money to support it...but if you think your not ready have an abortion...|`|4D1VEKW5aa	19-20 years old is not too young to have a child, 15 and under is and that happens alot. Also $4200 a month is a very doable income to raise a child. At your age and under your circumstances abortion should not be a considered option. You werent raped, you have a job and are of an acceptable age, theres no reason to give up for adoption as you will be a great mother. Congratulations!
NAzAmFDnaa	Go ahead, it is safe.  Vaseline may work better if he is very dry.  Don't try to scrub off the dry skin, you'll damage him.  Just keep him well moisturized.  Try a humidifier in the house or in his room as well.|`|U531TVPOaa	Try an Aquaphor brand ointment/cream. My niece uses that. I wouldn't put baby lotion on it, it'll probably sting. You can get it at the drug store or walmrt/target etc..|`|hGqQIusSaa	I used Eucerin on my daughter's face when she was younger.  It is very gentle and has no perfumes or dyes.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I put Cetaphil lotion on my baby's face after a bath.  He's 2 months old.|`|QvoPb2SBaa	I use Aveeno baby lotion (unscented) with oatmeal on my son's face. His pediatrician also recommended Vaseline- not the petroleum jelly type but the white cream one. Just make sure you buy something gentle, unscented and hypoallergenic.|`|iPxGgingaa	I would use a baby lotion that is marked harmless if ingested.     If you're not sure, call a pediatrician.|`|MgBkvm5Qaa	I think it would be fine...    but since im only 17 and dont have a baby...    i wouldnt take my word for it unless its all you got    my advice is to google it or call your doctor or even your parents...    but whatever the outcome good luck and im sorry i couldnt directly help you....    ciao!|`|ia7lyDuFaa	I use the Aveeno baby lotion on my son's face all the time and it works great.  Get the unscented kind and just make sure to rub it in very well.  This has been a godsend for my son's cheeks when they get all dry and irritated from constant teething and drooling.|`|ZRNlwu5laa	Lotion is okay for babies faces. Buy mild lotion or baby lotion and stay away from the eyes and mouth. Make sure to rub lotion in good. Equifil lotion is good and wash with cetaphil. This sould help the dy skin.|`|gx4s68s8aa	My daughter's doctor says that to be on the safe side use only Vaseline until they are 6 months old.  Likely most of the other "baby lotion" are safe, but Vaseline will likely work just as well if not better.  And with Vaseline you don't have to worry about the baby being allergic to it.
eihRNklDaa	there's a chance if your period is late. and if you're getting symptoms. how long has it been since you had intercourse|`|aOBmcGAZaa	We can't know this without knowing if you've been sexually active, when you were sexually active (in relation to your normal menstral cycle), how old you are, whether or not you used protection, ect ect ect.    I mean, from a simple quantum physics standpoint, you could be pregnant and not pregnant at the same time. However the probablily of such is infentesmile at best.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	It could be pregnancy or it could just be pms. Take a pregnancy test.
87f8699fae346ba5d63a2c44b54e0151aa	You could, by why would you? Pumping is a whole lot of work.    And for goodness' sake, please give the milk to your baby or donate it to a milk bank or something.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	It would help because your body is still working to produce the milk. Exercise and eating right is still the only proven way to lose the weight.|`|6hA0O06xaa	If you are planning on giving the milk to the baby rather than formula feeding, go ahead and pump for the baby's nutritional sake, not for the sake of losing weight!  That would be the most selfish thing I have ever heard!  I have been breastfeeding for 10 months now and still have some weight to lose (have not actively dieted since caloric restriction is not recommended if breastfeeding, but I have been eating healthy, exercising and going to the gym).  So it is not a given that you lose weight easier with breastfeeding.  Every women is different.  Just know that if you start pumping after the baby is born, you will stimulate milk production and will be very uncomfortable/engorged if you decide not to pump one day...you'll have to essentially wean yourself off the pump just like you'd slowly wean a baby.  Pumping is a big commitment and actually is a lot more effort that breastfeeding alone or formula feeding alone...since you are essentially adding a middle-man into the situation and still have to wash bottles etc.  The pumping session will take 10-20 minutes and THEN you still have to feed the baby (at least twice as much time is involved).|`|kt4oPp0gaa	Breastfeeding or pumping burns like 500 cal a day, but since you're going to pump just pump it out and give it to your baby with a bottle if she/he isn't latching on good.

zn6OVTJHaa	Forget the purees and the spoon feeding!    I highly highly highly recommend doing a "Baby Lead Weaning" approach. We did this with my son, and it was absolutely amazing. We gave up spoon feeding him, and eating separately to him, and instead from the age of 6 months, he sat at the table with us and fed himself.     Check out the blog that was created by two mothers to help people familiarize themselves with the method.    "You just hand them the food in a suitably-sized piece and if they like it they eat it and if they don't they won't. (But they do, really they do... check out the six-month-old with the banana.)    That's the essence of Baby Led Weaning. No purees, no ice cube trays, no moulis, no food processor, no potato masher, no baby rice, no mixing everything with expressed breast milk or formula, no weird combinations of fruits and vegetables, no preparing everything weeks in advance... just you and your child, eating food that you enjoy with you and your family. "    I have recommended this method to all of my friends with babies, and everyone agrees that is is absolutely fantastic.    I urge you to learn more, and see the benefits of increasing hand eye coordination, and a love of foods! :)|`|pXSKSS3daa	Teeth do not really matter. Most babies can gum things up without having teeth and they do just fine.    My son had two bottom teeth when I started regular table foods with him. He certainly didn't use those to chew but he did use his tongue and gums.    If he can pick up small pieces of food then let him go for it. We started at 7 months and his first meal was carrots, pears, and pasta. All were steamed well and cut into tiny pieces so he was able to grab them himself.|`|lGcpXteaaa	For finger foods my daughter loves anything like:  peas  chopped banana  Boiled soft carrots chopped  Parents choice puffs  Wholemeal bread.  Pasta    They can pretty have anything as long as its soft. You will be surprised that he may eat them with ease.  My daughter only has 2 teeth JUST poking through and she has had no problem with any of these.|`|23601a2348cb3f972406062ffa7f9839aa	I have a 6 month old and he has 2 teeth, I give him these things made by Gerber called either pinwheels or wagon wheels. They are baby hand sized and get really really soft and mushy as they gum them. I would start with the Gerber puffs foods as they dissolve more than cheerios do, and makes me a little less anxious about him choking. You can find all these in the same isle as your baby foods.

QSrXU7WCaa	no you gotta wait|`|AA10624857	I am assuming you mean you had sex 1 day ago. First, you don't always conceive on the day you have sex. This is because sperm can live inside a woman for several days, even as many as 6-7 days if conditions are optimal. Also, even when you are watching for ovulation by using basal temperature charts and monitoring cervical mucous, it is impossible to know exactly when ovulation takes place. An egg lives around 12-24 hours. So, if you had sex yesterday, but don't ovulate until tomorrow night, it may be as late as Friday before the sperm actually meets up with the egg. After the fertilization takes place, then it takes another bit of time for the egg to implant in the uterus. This takes about 7-10 days after fertilization. Once the egg is implanted than the pregnancy hormone, hCG begins to be produced. hCG is what a pregnancy test detects via urine or blood. It is also thought to be responsible for many of the symptoms associated with pregnancy such as morning sickness and tender breasts. It is certainly possible to conceive the same day you have sex, but it is also just as likely for the actual fertilization process not to have occurred until a few days later. If you have unprotected sex than miss a period, that is a good time to take a pregnancy test. Some women, especially those trying to conceive thus are more intuned to their body, do have signs of pregnancy before a missed period, but most women do not. If you've had unprotected sex and are worried about pregnancy, sometimes stress or PMS can cause pregnancy-type symptoms, especially missed periods, sore breasts, headache, and nausea.|`|ly59dQ3gaa	lol....NO!|`|S9ZyjTyyaa	one day after conception? No a pregnancy test wont even come up positive until you're a few weeks along.|`|sjocYlpCaa	One day since ...... ??????    If it's only one day since you had sex, it's not possible to tell if you are pregnant. Assuming you ovulated the same time you had sex, AND assuming the egg was fertilized, it will take a week or more for the egg to travel down the fallopian tubes and implant into the lining of the uterus. ONLY after that implantation has begun is it remotely possible to find out if you are pregnant. Usually though, you won't know until about a week later - the pregnancy hormone level may not be high enough until then to show up on a test.    If it's only one day since your period ended, it's not possible to tell if you are pregnant. And yes - you can get pregnant if you have sex during your period. It all depends on when you ovulate.    If it's only one day since your period is late - you need to get a test. There's no other way to find out. It could be that you ovulated late, which would in turn delay when your period starts; or it could be that you are pregnant; or it could be that you miscalculated when you are supposed to start.|`|98WKYtfwaa	You will not know after 1 day, you'll need to wait until you've missed a period before knowing. You might get some symptoms a week before your period is due, but you might not.    Just wait it out and see.|`|Tn4WQMA5aa	I have read your previous questions the symptoms ur having are not pregnancy it is fear and shock over what happened PLEASE GO TO A DOC AND GET A MORNING AFTER PILL AND REPORT YOUR SOB BOSS TO THE POLICE|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	1 day for what?  since you had sex?|`|qjcTW2vJaa	One day since you missed your period? Get a test...they make them now where you can find out up to 4 days before you are due to have your period - shouldnt be more than $15 or so...|`|oXCo6VX4aa	No, there is no way to tell for sure until you either miss your period or test positive.  Get yourself some early response (doesn't have to be that brand, just a more sensitive test) pregnancy tests and you can start testing a little before your next period is due if you're worried.|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	Have you showered? You should go to the hospital and see if they can find DNA evidence of the rape.    And no, no way to tell.     Try the Plan B pill to prevent the fertilized egg from implanting in your uterus.    If you're feeling sick it's probably from all the stress and trauma you just endured, and the anxiety of going back to work.    Best of luck to you.    I really hope you get that bastard in jail. Please tell me you went to a hospital for a rape kit. Any evidence..... any at all....
7rJrOb7eaa	He files with the court to force a DNA test to establish paternity. If the grandmother files for CS the court will do this anyway. BTW, any money he gives her without going through court he can't count off his taxes.|`|mF3PsJUVaa	he can request a dna, they would have to do that anyways if the grandmothers requesting child support. good for him!!!|`|mCDopsLEaa	File for Custody. It's as simple as that. From there, the judge will order a DNA test. He may need to hire a lawyer as custody cases can end up being a little complex.|`|AXEqOEloaa	He does not need to have his name on the cerificate, but more then likely needs to take a paternity test. Then he needs to talk with a lawyer.|`|eHjk9di0aa	Has he had visitation at all?    The courts aren't likely to just hand a 4 year old child over to someone the child doesn't even know.    He'll need to establish a relationship first.    And FYI, having custody of a child is more expensive then child support.

Sex is not required.|`|tc8nbxmyaa	yes....you'll also get pregnant if you hold hands with the opposite sex|`|THuplVHpaa	Only if it's with a goat. You know... the usual for you.|`|2esGKO2Caa	well of coarse that's how baby's are made i wouldn't do it if i were you but hey don't take my word for it ask your mom.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	No, not if you're by yourself.  I think you need to read a sex education book.  I hope the schools are still teaching sex ed.|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	If you are masturbating by yourself then no. You can't. You need sperm and a mature egg to get pregnant.    If you and your partner are masturbating together and semen goes inside the vagina then yes there is a possibility.|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	umm no|`|VADaU7AJaa	no.. you need both a man/women to get pregnant obviously..|`|Jpgz4mSVaa	not alone!|`|VhwI7d6uaa	nop u cant...|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	If sperm was near the vaginal area-if not then GROW UP :-s dont they teach you anything in school?|`|onbwN4csaa	Don't let these people screw with you.......  You are asking a question. No not just masturbating by yourself.  You need both sexes to become pregnant. with No sperm from a male you can not become pregnant.    I hate the way some people do this.  You people know who you are.    She's looking for answers. Give her the truth.  At least she's looking.    When people reach out. Don't Mark them.  answer them truly.  . Who taught you.!!!!!!    Same on you.|`|KK3RkRjxaa	Ask your parents!!|`|frpCK0utaa	No. This question makes me afraid for the future of mankind.|`|KxBPpzgIaa	YES I DID|`|wb8WwWMNaa	Not unless there's semen involved.|`|kqylekVBaa	welll................  if you use the semen as lubricant than there is definetly a possiblity!!!|`|qxCxIECoaa	Absolutely not.     If you have touched a penis right before masturbating and there is semen on your hands, then yes. But only in that situation.|`|vOMuBuw4aa	YES! EVERYTIME YOU MASTURBATE YOU CAN ALSO GO BLIND TOO!!!!!!!    MASTURBATE AND JESUS CRIES,  AND A KITTEN DIES|`|yYCPLCyyaa	umm... if u have sperm on ur fingers....
SBj7fhNvaa	You could always keep track of your cycle on a calender and use an ovulation calculator online (there are tons of good ones just google it) or you could use ovulation predictor kits the sell them at all drugstores and Walmart for around $20 or just follow your cervical mucus when its stickier and whiter they say you should be ovulating!  Good Luck!|`|NvoHMxQcaa	I always used websites. Go to google and type in Ovulation Calendars or Ovulation Calculators. I also kept track of my BBT. It worked for me, and I got pregnant the first time!
slxhzLhcaa	The only time i have ever spotted in between periods was when i was pregnant...and turns out it was implantation bleeding. Im not really sure if you could have implantation bleeding if nothing implanted itself into your uterus...i hope this helps!!!|`|XO4talxxaa	I had some spotting in between my period last month and i got really excited but it turned out to be nothing! I only spotted when whiped once on  friday and then once more on saturday that was it. lol I think sometimes our bodies just get really out of wack! I have never had spotting before either!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I have two children and never experienced implantation bleeding.|`|JjBwydymaa	Implantation is actually not as common as people think it is. But if people have it, it should either be pink/brow spotting. Very light and can occur anything from 5-12 days after ovulation if conception was successful
DN6XtoViaa	symptoms don't really show up until after implantation happens... and that happens between 6-10dpo. so it could just be your body tricking you. (which happens a lot with women who are trying to conceive) or you could have actually ovulated earlier and are farther along then you thought.    either way good luck! and heres hoping its your month :)|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    I don't think it can be implantation bleeding as its a bit too early as this normally occurs 6-10dpo.  It may possibly be so, if you ovualated a little early?  Best thing i can advise is doing a test feb 10th in period doesn't turn up.    Best of luck xx
PfIywLLyaa	Yes. Congrats!|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	I would believe that would be the case    16 divided by 4 = 4|`|LuNIHklsaa	I would say you are 4 months when you are 17/18 weeks. You are pregnant for 9 calendar months and 10 lunar months. Good luck XXX|`|QSodlfMraa	yes i would girl.     congrats & good luck|`|7C9Ett7Caa	According to the best selling pregnancy book "What to Expect When Your Expecting" your exactly 4 months at 17 weeks.   The 5th month: 18-22 weeks  The 6th month: 23-27 weeks  The 7th month: 28-31 weeks  The 8th month: 32-35 weeks  The 9th month: 36-40+ weeks  Hope this helps, Good Luck, and Congrats on the pregnancy!!    And to those who say divide16 by 4: There is only 4 weeks in Feb, all other months have 5 weeks, so that way of calculating doesnt work..|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes it would.|`|fc5KHr6aaa	You don't really want to think of it that way. When you get to 20 weeks and you are saying that you are 5 months pregnant....you still have 5 months left. A month is a few days longer than 4 weeks. So, yes you can say that you are 4 months, but just know that pregnancy lasts longer than 9 4-week months. Most people are okay if you just go by the week and say that you are 16 weeks pregnant.|`|CipBS79zaa	Tricky one this.Four weeks in a month, so thats 16 divided by four. I make that 4. Check it out yourself with a calculater I could be wrong......|`|rS7fh6pRaa	YESSS! lol|`|O182rdRyaa	yes i think so. :]|`|joPJtKemaa	Yes    Divide 16/4=4months

9p9DDRSnaa	RELAX!  Everything is going to be alright.  When you have sex for the first time, he will break through your hyman.  This can cause a little bit of bleeding.  If he used a condom you should be fine whether he *** or not.  The first time is never any fun though.  Just relax...it happens to everyone and as long as you are practicing safe sex you will be alright.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	yes, you should take plan b    you can get pregnant the first time|`|2Q7vDzcCaa	my first was much worse than yours.   i was gushing... like i was loosing a lot of blood!   it was crazy, i was hella freaking out... but i wouldn't think i'm going to get pregnant since i was bleeding that much.     just to be sure... y not|`|yB5go5wbaa	bleeding after having sex for the first time is normal.  if he used a condom (properly) you probably aren't pregnant, but there's always a chance EVERY time you have sex.  I wouldn't take the plan b pill because the likelihood of being pregnant is not very high (that's IF you guys used the condom properly.  If you're really worried, call planned parenthood, they've got counselors that can talk to you about all of that.
xV0APOtaaa	My friend had doorknob covers that had to be pinched and turned to open otherwise they just spun around the doorknob. So after she put her 2 yr old to bed and shut the door, he couldn't get it open again.|`|emkT1a6raa	maybe he just feels the need to be close to you, you  know that kind of "protected,safe" feeling little kids get. i'm only 13, so i dont know much, but i'd say lye with him on his bed until he falls asleep and when he does go into your bed.. or if you'd like, on some nights you can move his bed into your room. tell him "johnny, mommy and daddy need their alone time". he might not understand but he's going to have too.|`|Gc1bznpTaa	Supernanny's method is fantastic.  Just keep returning him to bed, no eye contact, no talking axcept maybe ''It's bedtime''.  It is hard work but the message gets through eventually.    Also even though he is two it is still worth having a look at 'Contented little baby' book by Gina Ford.  I used it with my second child from about 6 months.  It is about teaching them to get off to sleep on their own etc.  Anyway the only thing I can say is that is worked for me and I can't recommend it enough.  Give it a go & good luck!|`|OIiwMWEVaa	make sure that they have some kind of "friend" with them. Get a stuffed animal, or something, just something to make them feel not alone. =)|`|fJmfCdJCaa	Take him back to his bed and say "its bedtime now..i love you" then next time "Its bedtime" then take him to bed and say nothing...Keep doing this over and over until they stay in bed.  It sounds harsh..but it works :)    Hope i helped/thats what you ment!!
yVvnZ4hpaa	I think he's trying to tell you that one nap will do him! Considering that he sleeps for more than 12 hours a night (lucky!), one nap will give him plenty of rest during the day.
Wok0Y6ebaa	8 babies, all natural.|`|3oGRNQKyaa	i think it was 8 in india or somewhere close|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I read about a couple who gave birth to 8 babies without the use of fertility drugs.|`|AA11935049	eigh however the woman had to have a c-secition but the woman was not on any fetility drugs at all
8z03BV5Saa	Yes they can-fraternal and identical.    I am a triplet. Me-Leighton-Carrie:blonde hair and my sisters Lo and Lelland have brown hair. We have the same facial features too.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Identical triplets can occur but are extremely rare, most triplets consist of two identical twins and one fraternal sibling.|`|oP504BtFaa	Some do, some don't. Identical twins and triplets would be the same egg splitting into either two or three separate eggs...they would all be the same gender with the exact same DNA, and yes, look the same. Twins and triplets can also be fraternal, meaning they came from two or three separate eggs...different DNA, but could all be the same gender, or a mix. OR with triplets, two could be identical and one could be fraternal...two eggs, but one egg split into two.    And for some extras, since this is my expertise, quadruplets you can get an abundance of different circumstances! Either four separate eggs, or two eggs that both split, or three eggs and one split...so many options! I have all girl quadruplets and they are all fraternal, meaning they all had their own egg and they have their own DNA.|`|mCDopsLEaa	You would still have your fraternal/identical issue. i don't think you can have identical triplets. Because in order to get identically twins 1 egg splits---into two resulting in identical. In order for all triplets to be identical the egg would split twice which would actually result in 4 babies not three. MOST triplets are fraternal meaning three seperate eggs or they can possible have a set of identical twins and a loner.|`|ACOF4tSjaa	based on what my friends look like; no. 2 of them look like twins and the 3rd 1 looks older than his triplet siblings.  They're supposed to be identical.

7b9950c99c6ea90a89b5e6b29c014f81aa	It's used to help you produce more milk and it was also used in the old days to make your boobs grow. The only thing is that you will be smelling like syrup. Your sweat and your pee will smell like that too. I don't think you have to be a certain age to take fenugreek but if your still in puberty you should wait because you haven't finished developing yet.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Fenugreek isn't a vitamin.  It is an herbal suppliment.    The wikipedia article will tell you everything you need to know.  Anyone can take it at any age.  It isn't just for milk production.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenugreek

Xt1LxiWAaa	all you can do it to eat healthy!  i am now 31 weeks pregnant with twins. i am short and skinny as well...i'm very small. (and lucky me, i get to carry twins!) i had trouble gaining weight as well...however, you don't really gain that much weight in the beginning, its mostly in the end. and your body will just add on the pounds, trust me. my doctor told me to start gaining weight, so i kept eating healthy...but then my mom bought me a lot of stuff like chips and dip! yes, its not healthy, but it does have the fat and the calories and thats what babies need. that added on weight for me. just add on the calories along with eating healthy and you'll be fine.  also, i have a small chest as well, however, as you get further along in your pregnancy, you will get a bigger bust. and just because you have a small chest does not mean that you can't breast feed!  i would have a talk with your doctor about your concerns, and they can give you advice. also, if your doctor hasn't worried about your weight, then you shouldn't worry.   good luck!|`|DSp6zjeGaa	slowly you will start to gain the weight just eat healthy if not the weight will stay after the baby and ur breast will get bigger after the baby is born so dont worry enjoy your pregnancy!!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	dont worry about being to small chest or body wise as long as you eat healthy your baby will be fine. your chest will get bigger after birth if you decide to breast feed. when you breastfeed your breast get larger to hold the supply of milk that the baby needs during each feeding.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Don't worry about your breasts - they'll enlarge 2-3 days after you give birth with all the milk that baby will need.|`|zLVZyfwUaa	Your body will gain as it sees fit, just make sure you are getting plenty of protein and dairy.  As to your breasts, some ladies get bigger during pregnancy and some don't until after the baby arrives.  It sounds like you're one of the latter.  Breast size has nothing to do with how you will produce milk.  Trust me I had tiny breasts and I was overflowing with milk.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	I wouldn't worry too much just yet, if you are a first time mom it may take a while before you begin to show and gain substantial weight. I didn't start showing really until 24 weeks, but after that it was a substantial pop! :) If your Dr. isn't too concerned, you shouldn't be! He may be able to set you up on a special diet to help you gain if you need it.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Well, just keep eating healthy and try increasing your caloric intake alittle. For example maybe eat about 300 -500 more calories a day, just make sure its still healthy. You should slowely start to go up in weight a little. but i wouldn't stress about your weight too much. Talk to your doctor about it. If they arn't too worried about it, then your probably fine. good luck.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	count your calories and keep track of what you normally eat.  If it's not enough then start adding more healthy foods in like protein, good fats and what not.  My advice to you is to keep a food journal for a week or 2 and then look at what you're eating and what you should be eating.  Talk to your doctor to see if you need to be uping your calorie in take or what type of foods you should be eating.|`|KPKd8dzNaa	I would talk to your doctor and see if he/she will recommend you to a nutritionist.  I kept losing weight with my pregnancies & my doc almost sent me.  I just tried to eat as much as I could.  I gained 17 pounds with my first & 30 with my 2nd and my 2nd was twins.      Good luck & god bless!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I have done some research and there is no correlation between the size of breasts and how much milk they produce.  The vast majority of the size of breasts are made up of fat tissue, not milk ducts.  Larger breasts mean more fat tissue, but not necessarily more milk ducts and milk-producing ability.  My breasts have not grown at all yet during this pregnancy, but my doctor said they will fill up after I give birth.  As for you being so thin, try drinking a Boost High Protein nutritional energy drink every day.  I drink one everyday because they are very good for the baby and also for myself.  Good luck and don't worry!|`|lYkvps54aa	i have heard kababs are the bees knees for gaining weight..  :)|`|u7kDLuklaa	Small breasts will not impede breastfeeding in any way.  Your body will know what to do when the time comes.  Small breasts produce exactly the same as larger ones.    As far as gaining weight, adding more healthy carbohydrates is probably your best bet.    Good luck and congrats on the pregnancy!|`|TDLmhGauaa	Your body will progress as it meant to support both you and baby, your breasts should plumpen out a bit more towards the end of the pregnancy and as you are due to give birth. Please don't get yourself too much stressed over this because if you weren't meant to have a baby then you wouldn't have fell pregnant in the first place.  If you want to put on a little bit more weight then my suggestion is eat a bit more red meat or the substitute if you are a vegetarian. Also sweeter things like chocolate are always a great treat and they help stabilise blood sugar levels - but don't overdo it because it can also trigger migraines, if you are prone to them.  BasicallyI think that you are actually quite lucky because after you have had the baby you won't have to fight to get rid of the baby fat. One last thing whatever you do do, then do it with caution and awareness because you don't want to have to regret it later on down the line. Basically just keep yourself healthy and your body will take care of baby too.|`|VMASMHX6aa	I am a Nutritionist and I really don't think you need to worry too much about the weight gain issue. The idea that the mother's weight is related to how well the baby is doing has been long abandoned! That is why women are no longer weighed at their ante natal appointments (not in the UK anyway). The mother's weight largely relates to her and the amount of body fat she is carrying. As long as your midwife is happy with your fundal height then you really don't need to worry about it. Put your scales away for a while!    Just make sure you are eating well and regularly. You could try increasing your portion sizes a little, or eating foods which are high calorie but full of goodness like oatcakes and hummous. Have a piece of cheese once a day. Add a banana to a bowl of cereal. Have some nuts if you don't have allergies in baby's immediate family. Things like that will ensure you are getting enough calories each day. You don't actually need any extra calories in pregnancy until you are in your third trimester and then it's only 200 a day!    My best friend is just tiny - she weighs about 7 stone and is a size zero and very flat chested but she had a totally healthy baby and has been breastfeeding her for 8 months now. And she certainly wasn't flat chested once her milk came in - it was funny seeing her with boobs!    Congrats on your baby.|`|BU1f41Wcaa	Is your Dr worried about your weight? If not i wouldnt worry about it and if you are talk to him/her about how you can gain weight the best way for you and baby.As far as your "small chest" as you progress in your pregnancy you will get "fuller" So dont stress about it its not good for you or baby :)    Good luck and congrats :)|`|2c726775df1bee382684b2b2b4d3e248aa	Like you I was very thin during my four pregnancies.  I only had a 32A bra, but when the time came I had enough milk to feed my own baby and have lots left over to bottle for the local hospital (in those days, before HIV/Aids mothers used to donate their excess milk for the premature babies).  The most I put on in any of my pregnancies was 12lbs but the babies, although small, were all born healthy and are now wonderful adults.  Dont try to put on too much weight, it will not help the baby or yourself; just eat healthly and relax - a calm Mum to be has a calm baby - I know this from experience.  Good luck.|`|ZvaFsGvjaa	I was really small while I was pregnant too  I don't know what "stones" are haha cause we go by pounds here but yeah  I ended up drinking protein shakes. They were the only thing that really made me gain weight. I was really sick my whole pregnancy and could only really get down fruits and veggies and healthy things , weird but good haha  yeah protein shakes though :)    and the breastfeeding will go fine as long as you EAT enough. I didn't and I lost my milk at 6 months post partum. It was devistating for me especially knowing that it was my fault.|`|mWxBHXFnaa	eat more than 3 meals a day but carefully Choice the products you eat. because your pregnant, you should eat things that are full of nutrition like veggies and fruits. also, eat a things that contain fats but Limit the sat fats because sat is the bad fat. not only that, you should also limit your drug consumption smoking  and drinking.    ooh-oh drink more milk or anything that contains calcium because it will help your baby and you in carrying out normally daily functions. also because it will help Limit the chance of osteoporosis|`|Op6z8nogaa	Congratulations!   your belly will stretch becasue you are pregnant anyway so you will gain weight through that anyway.

IcUEDkoraa	Talk to your midwife and see what she may suggest, my friend only put on a small bit of weight and she was overdue and she didn't even look pregnant she wears a size 8 clothes, her baby boy was born weighing 6lb 10oz, you may all of a sudden get massive, all women are different good luck hun x|`|sWUxWeDfaa	My usual weight is 8 stone. when i was pregnant i went to 9 stone near the end. If that is your normal weight then I woulnt worry. you can be small and have a perfect baby! Just make sure you are eating the rights foods and keep yourself healthy.   My bust never really got big at all and I basically stayed the same size. You can still breast feed your baby if you have small boobs. when your baby starts suckling then the milk will start flowing and they should fill out a bit. I breast fed my baby for 1 day and I didnt like it. Its not for everyone, but the midwifes will push you to breast feed. its totally up to you, doesnt matter if you have small boobs.   If you are normaly a small build then dont worry its just the way you are and it will not effect your baby.   As I am only a small build I thought my baby was going to be tiny and I had a shock when she was born 71b 8oz and all the 'tiny baby' clothes I bought were too small.|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	My sister was under weight when she was pregnant and they told her to drink ensure.

It seems crazy that you can feel love for something in a dream, but I know how you must've felt. It freaked me out too. I am nowhere near having a child at all but my sister and some of my older friends so I think I had the dream just because I'm "growing up" and will, one day, have kids.    I usually take dreams pretty literally personally, they're usually about something I'd been thinking about.    Has someone close to you had a baby? Have you been thinking about when you'll have one someday? Since you'll be graduating in a few years maybe you're thinking about what your future career will be and whether you'll be able to stay at home when you have kids or not. Or it could be something between you and your mother. Did she work or stay at home? Maybe you wish she would have stayed at home if she didn't. Has anything different happened in your life?|`|U531TVPOaa	It could just be a strange dream. One time I had a dream that I was in-love with another woman and we lived together and everything. With that same "real love" feeling. Except I'm not gay or even close to it. Dreams can just be dreams sometimes..
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I tested positive too. Dont worry about it! They will put an IV in you and give you antibiotics every couple hours. The 5% of babies who contract it are from mothers who were not treated. Dont sweat the small stuff hun. And dont go for the C-section if you dont have to.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	What you read online is not always accurate and based on the most current research. I just completed my annual nursing mandatory education for my job, and latest research shows that less than 2% of babies born to infected mothers contract the illness, and less than 50% of those that contract it actually, die. And yes, these are almost born to mothers who were not identified as being GBS positive or the mothers were not treated with antibiotics during labor, or the infant's infection was not diagnosed soon enough.   Don't worry. I work at a hospital that has 5000+ births per year, and I have never seen a GBS infected infant, let alone any die from it.|`|5Crovdoaaa	I've had it with all three pregnancies. Just take the antibiotics and the baby will be fine. I don't think they'll authorize a medical c-section for Strep B. I know it seems scary, but it's very commonplace and the hospitals are used to treating. And don't look up diagnoses on the internet!!!!|`|weE5FxCfaa	i was diagnosed with group B strep with my 3rd child.  you will receive 2 doses of meds given 4 hours apart while in labor.  my labor went so fast  with my 3rd that i only got one dose, however my dr told me he has never seen a baby get sick with even one dose of antibiotics.  i did not have a c-section and do not recommend one just because of this.  after you are tested positive they treat you as positive with all of the rest of your pregnancies so when i had my 4 i had to do antibiotics again.  both babies were just fine.  the only thing you have to be sure of is getting to the hospital in time to at least get one dose, but since this is your first baby that should be fine.|`|TEAXr347aa	Your baby will be fine. They'll give you and IV with antibiotics during labor. Don't fret! Congrats! God bless. No, do not have a C-section if you can help it! I had my first baby by C-section after 32 hours of labor and my last two vaginally. I had to take percaset (spelling?) for my C. and only ibuprofen for pain with the VBACs.
cTsb7vFjaa	Bring your own toilet paper - the stuff they give you feels like paper!|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	don't forget any paperwork if you have any from the hospital. thats on my number one list to bring!! have you already filled out any of the paperwork at the hospital, because if you haven't, you might want to....it will be so much easier for you and whoever goes with you...because it does take time...and you won't want to do it when your going into labor!!|`|28ZCfGWIaa	If you're nursing, make sure you get a good bra in a bigger size than you are now and make sure it is extremely comfortable. You might be tender and will need a bra to support.    That is what I forgot my first time. : /|`|aS8TjALBaa	Bring a massager or some sort of roller thing that someone can use on your back.  It helps so much!|`|5Crovdoaaa	Snacks for in between meals (I was STARVING after giving birth)    Socks    Chapstick    Underwear that you won't mind getting ruined. They give you some weird underwear there, but I never liked it.    An extra pillow-the hospital ones suck!    EDIT: The hospital will supply the green rubber pacifiers, which are great. (I always told them I 'lost' the first one so I could get an extra!) They will also have a hospital grade pump, and a lactation consultant to come help you with bf'ing and pumping. Then you can rent or buy one when you leave.|`|cSm1zod4aa	I'm only 5 months pregnant but already people are telling me things to take. Some of the things they are telling me include:  **your own shampoo and conditioner/body wash  **slippers (incase you have to walk to help progress labor)  **even if you have an outfit picked out for baby, bring a couple to ensure you have one that fits him/her  **If you want your baby to have a certain pacifier bring that  ** of course extra clothes for yourself and your significant other if they plan on staying there with you  **Your own toothbrush   **anything to take care of yourself like makeup, hair brush etc..  **Blanket for baby, incase its cold and you need another or if you want to use that instead of the hospital one    **thats all I can think of right now but be sure to take any diapers or bottles and blankets from the hospital.. anything thats on the little bed thing that baby is in.. that stuff is yours.    Good Luck!!! Hope you have a great delivery!!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	the baby book, a camera, and some snacks or money for food cuz most hospital food sucks!|`|gYU10xTcaa	this is also my first child im 38 weeks pregnant!!! but what i packed was some nice comfty pj's for the hospital, socks, lotion, perfume, shampoo and conditioner, you know the main essential things. bring old underwear that you wont mind geting stained since i heard you bleed a lot most likely they will get stained. ummmm for the baby im bringing a blanket and some clothes with a pacifier. maybe bring a camera if you have one and things to entretain you while you wait to give birth. oh and if you have a breast pump bring it too.|`|owba80mcaa	Remember your bag of toothbrush, and change of underwear, etc.  I wish i would of thought to bring a pair of flip flops for the shower, and i don't know if you are having a vaginal birth or c-cection, but i had a emergency c-cection and didn't think to bring like a slip over night gown so it didn't go across my belly.  Also, bring some large pads, for your discarge after having the baby.  I really can't think of anything else.... Maybe it's helpful?  I hope so, good luck to you!
AA10953561	I seriously doubt it harmed your baby. That early on the baby isn't even connected to you, or if it is, it's receiving most of it's nutrients and life support from the egg sac in which it is living. When the placenta gets bigger there will be more risk from things like getting your nails done, drugs, medications, and alcohol.    Good luck, hon!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Most likely there isnt anything wrong with the baby. I drank heavily the weekend before I found out I was pregnant and my son is fine. I have seen nail salon workers who were pregnant painting nails in all those fumes. Your baby will be fine. Congrats.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	getting your nails done when your pregnant is fine! enjoy pampering yourself.|`|veO1RXrCaa	There is nothing wrong with getting your nails done.  Im sure they are plenty of pregnant nail techs and they have all had healthy baby's.|`|joPJtKemaa	Don't worry i have my nails done all the time. To be on a safe side the next time you go ask them to give you a face mask so you don't inhale all the chemicals.
4qlNDbNLaa	not safe in a tanning bed, in natural sun light I would still use at least spf 30|`|FEzmVmFjaa	Course tanning isn't really good for anyone because of skin cancer, but I live in Hawaii and it's embarrassing to be really pregnant and pale lol. But, I DO know, that if you do tan, whether it be in or out of a tanning bed, they worry about your body temp. rising, as it can be harmful to the baby.  Also, just a little side note (you may not care - but I am SUPER paranoid about stretch marks) I have talked to women who said that they didn't have a single stretch mark BEFORE they tanned their bellies because the sun pulls the melatonin under your skin to the surface (making you darker) and it makes your skin tighten, thus creating stretch marks! So be careful! =)|`|AA10186411	DO NOT.  It can literally "cook" your baby from the inside.  20 minutes is like a full day out in the sun, so its a lot more UV radiation than a few hours on the beach.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Tanning is radiation, which is bad for the baby. It says on the tanning bed not to tan while you are pregnant. Don't take the risk of harming the baby.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	its not safe at all. just like going into a hot tub when your pregnant.   wait till your not pregnant to go tanning.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	DO NOT EVER TAN WHILE YOU ARE PREGNANT. IT'S LIKE PUTTING YOUR BABY IN A SAUNA. HEATING PADS DIRECTLY ON YOUR STOMACH AND VERY HOT BATHS ARE ALSO A NO NO. THIS IS ALSO WHY YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE DOCTOR IF YOU RUN A FEVER... YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WILL LITERALLY COOK YOUR BABY!|`|joPJtKemaa	i WOULD NOT RISK IT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE PREGNANT!!!|`|ancCGTqMaa	The risk of tanning during pregnancy is not radiation.  lol  The risk is over-heating.  Just use a spray tan if you cannot live without a tan and save the tanning bed for after you deliver the baby.|`|L0873cdDaa	Tanning is unsafe anyway. Don't do it.
ZVqEDvZSaa	lol your bf gave you a hand job too..do you have a penis? lol     sorry that was just funny|`|GO7tZtPxaa	Yeah you could be pregnant although it would be really really unlucky if you are... Noone on here is going to be able to tell you for sure, you are just going to bite the bullett and do a pregnancy test- its the only way you will ever really know..    Good luck.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	It's possible. You said you know you should take a pregnancy test... Well you just answered your own question!!|`|4lrhZL7Naa	i dont think you can get pregnant from hand jobs. Once Sperm is exposed to air...they die. Its all in your head|`|fPX1lD8uaa	The only way your going to know if your pregnant or not is if you take a pregnancy test.    Good luck!|`|0psCy0XXaa	it's not unheard of so get yourself a test asap, if you are pregnant it won't go away so sooner is better than later.|`|IJnfoIehaa	what kind of question is that?! he gave you a hand job too? i didnt know that was possible unless you mean like after you gave him a handjob and he cumed then he fingered you. now that makes since and yes you may become pregnant. take a hpt to be sure and next time be more careful|`|973GEZrZaa	sperm does not " die " when it hits air     and yes its possible    and its semen.. not seaman.    and fingering.. not a handjob.
PFO1jxZGaa	they dont test you for a pregnancy, just drugs, just pee in the cup but be prepared for not getting hired since I'm sure you are showing already at 6 mos. No one hires a pregnant person if they have a choice. Sorry|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Why would you do that? If you get cought giving fake urine  you could be in trouble and definetly not get hired. Why dont you just be honest with your employer and let them know? I know some places dont hire you prego but legally they are NOT aloud to do that. You could sue them for that. But you need to let them know so that you can find out if you are going ot be able to get maternity leave in a few months.|`|Def3uk2aaa	that would be like the screening company NOT telling the employer your urine was packed with drug traces when they could see you were baked out of your face.  It won't work.  That's the screening company's job.|`|7HEZhx46aa	Okay, that's not what they look for in a urinalysis. That's a drug screen. Why would you hide the fact that you're pregnant anyway? Do you know that even if you get this job, they can fire you within the first 90 days for no reason whatsoever anyway? DON'T LIE.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Don't be dishonest.  So, you show up obviously pregnant and the what?  Don't you think this will make things a bit uncomfortable at work for you?  Just go do it, they may not have a problem with it, and besides I don't think they're testing for pregnancy....they're testing for drugs.  They will get a test result, I doubt there will be some conversation about :"the pregnant woman" who came in.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Lying to an employer before you even get started is a very bad idea. And the odds of being caught are very high.This would be grounds to fire you even if they did hire you.If I were you, I'd wait til after you had the child to look for a job.Your idea has no chance of working. And yes, these companies already know the tricks people try to pull.|`|AA10260497	i am pretty sure that all they are going to test your urine for is drugs. I have never heard of an employer doing a pregnancy test.|`|ddP3klT3aa	They don't test for pregnancy. I think that's illegal. They are going to know you are pregnant. I had a job interview at 8 months pregnant and he was about to hire me but I told him I didn't think it was a good idea being as far along as I was. Using some one else's urine is fraud and it illegal. They are testing for drugs. Why do you want to hide your pregnancy?|`|tmh42R6Caa	Two things:  1) It's illegal to use your pregnancy as a deciding factor on employment.    2) A drug test only tests for drugs.  They won't test for pregnancy and they won't report it.      Don't mention the pregnancy.  They can't ask.  I interviewed for a job 8 months pregnant and actually got it!  I think they were so afraid to discriminate against me that they just handed me the job.  Good luck!|`|AA11447210	Not sure what kind of job you're going for, but I wasn't aware pregnancy was something you were screened for when doing a pee test for a job. They typically want to know if you are a drug user...not if you're about to have a baby.    However, knowing you will be needing time off in about 3 months may have a bearing on the job...although I doubt it would be legal for them to deny you the position based on your being pregnant (doesn't mean it can't happen)|`|AA11616741	Why would you have to use other urine when they can see that you are pregnant? What are you doing while you are pregnant that shouldn't show up in the urine? I'm confused....
njLVIp55aa	Tell ur parents...she needs to get away from this guy and get herself help!|`|7ALEGSFaaa	My friend, according to him, happens to know what your yahoo ID and your facebook account is and he brought to my attention this question a half a minute ago.  Laura, I want to bring to your attention that I am his friend, why do you call him depressed.  He knows that your sister has aborted.  That is why he acts depressed because he is worried about her too, but he doesn't want to talk about it to anyone except me (because he trusts me the most), because it is a personal subject.  He is the kind of guy who keeps almost everything by himself, especially things like this.  Now don't you ever talk like that about my friend again or I am going to tell your parents what your sister has done, ok?  You don't want that do you?  I happen to know your dad pretty well too since I work with him and I love my friend like a father would love his son.  No need to specify things.|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	The best thing to do is to tell your parents. She may be mad for a while but it will pass. As for having an abortion, most of the time when it's preformed by a trained physician it is fairly safe. Although my guess is that having multiple abortions could cause some damage to her fertility in the future. So even though telling on her might make her angry now, how would you feel if in the future she finally cleaned herself up but was not able to have a baby when she really wanted one?   Sorry it has to be your responsibility, I am sure it's a tough decision but it's the right thing to do.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	You have to tell your parents. They'll know what to do. She will probably be mad at you for doing it, but eventually she will get over it. It's better to have her be upset with you for a while than to have her keep continuing on the path she's on.|`|3gXQPso5aa	tell your mom and dad|`|AA11348933	Honey, your mum and dad need to know.  Abortion is not meant to be birth control.  Repeated abortions cannot be good for her.  Encourage her to talk to your parents.  This is way beyond your scope.  She needs to talk with them.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	You should tell her that abortions shouldnt be used as birth control, and that if she doesnt want to have kids she should stop having sex. Having multiple abortions can also ruin your chances of ever having children in the future as it totally messes you up on the inside. One of these days shell get an abortion and it will be her last, ever.
W9FRk32iaa	if his name is JOHNATHAN HARVEY hell yeah he has alot more than 3.lol.Honey unfortunately men lie,so you will probably never know.If he can't tell the truth about how many kids he has he probably wont tell the truth about anything else either.You need to leave his sorry *** alone.I've been there so I know.|`|eA3JLzbyaa	He probably doesn't know himself how many he has. Nice man you've given your poor child as a father.|`|AA10186411	First off, learn some grammar skills.  Anyways, there is no way you can tell.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	goodl uck with that one. you should really know who your laying down and making a child with|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I second Landon's Momma...|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	There is no way you can find out.|`|4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	You're supposed to find out basic facts like that before you make another of his babies, not after.     I'd claim for child support - that way you're certain to find out immediately, because he will be yelling poverty to the courts with his other *xx* kids to feed and clothe.|`|c73QkZ2haa	If hes not gonna tell you then theres nothing you can do about it. This is usually something discussed before makin a baby btw for future reference.|`|AWqGmJUxaa	good luck in find out but you could tell him that he will not tell you the Truth tell him it over
P85JcwGRaa	How many days is your cycle normally? Bearing in mind that day one is the first day of your period. If your cycle is 31 days long then you may well get a negative result as your periods not yet due.    I would wait a couple of days and if your period still hasn't started take another test.   Some women just don't have a high enough level of the HCG hormone to register on a pregnancy test until after your period is due (with my first I had to wait a week after to get a postive result)  Good luck|`|7nblD4bjaa	Yes i never had a positive test. i had to go to the doctor and they took my blood.
hWc65sEtaa	Considering you are having every symptom possible, I would say yes.  Take a test.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	uuuuhhhhh yaaa lol..... those are all early prego signs! if u had unprotected sex then a big YES i think u could be. get off ur computer and go get a test ! good luck !|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Take a home pregnancy test or go to the doctor.|`|GpR5MI5raa	You might be. take a test.|`|eryJKCpfaa	i had cramping a week after conception. Its called implanation cramping. Sometimes you will spotting along with it. you should be able to take a test to find out. Use your first pee in the morning|`|YseGAHIfaa	you could be, take a test.    if you had your period last month, then i doubt that these symptoms would show so soon, but i suppose it could happen. theres no point coming on here & asking us, theres only one way.. take a test.    good luck..!! x|`|5A7DQjTxaa	I can't say 100% but it sure sounds like it.  When before I even missed my period I would get so tired in the midafternoon that one day I was walking by the cafteria at work and envisioned myself just lying down on the table for a quick nap.  VERY unlike me so I started to pump in more coffee.  Then I was a few days late and I also have irregular periods but I was having cramps and figured it was my period comming, BUT you can also have cramps when you are newly prego to.  Last but now least the smells is what always triggured my morning sickness.  I could not go grocery shopping for a while because of all the smells in the store.  No candles at home, nothing with an odor.    Last bit of advice....it may be early for a test but go get your self one.  I live in the country and when I made a speical trip into town and back home again I had bought only one test that is a very well know name.  The results came back inconclusive.  SO I had to go back to town and back home again, go with the clear blue easy test.  If you really want to know go to the doctor, results won't take long.    Drink some OJ just in case as not having enough of a vit. in OJ (the name is escaping my memory right now) can cause spina bifida for the baby
6cbc8aa526f1d8a4967171b5772393d5aa	I hope not spelling like that.  If you are worried about it get a Home pregnancy test and take it.    Try birth control. And tell your man to wrap it up.
hWc65sEtaa	Just take a test.|`|26A1Q3eqaa	i agree with the fact that you need an english lesson. You cant be a day older then 14. Try using this strange thing that was invented i think its called a condom not sure look it up, or maybe keep your legs closed or even better take birth control pills if none of the above fit you. I doubt you are pregnant to answer you amazing question you asked. If i am correct and you are young you are still developing and that could be why things seem a little funny, if you still believe you are pregnant go to a clinic or grab a test from the dollar tree.|`|p0prrzf2aa	just so you know this is not a "haha" matter.     if you had your period your not pregnant, maybe you got an STD or something. go to the doc, be tested for pregnancy and STDS    good luck|`|VzOokYEqaa	take a test... best time to take it when you wake up in the morning.|`|em8A42Bqaa	EPT  Clearblue Easy   I cant think of the rest but you get what I mean|`|CFFuFof1aa	You should definetly go to the doctor and take a test if you haven't already! You could be pregnant. It is very normal to cramp and have a slight period while being pregnant. Make an appt and get checked out. If you are pregnant you need to get prenatal care...and if you aren't pregnant something else could be wrong.    Good luck......and make an appt!!|`|yIJTHeFzaa	ur showing some symptoms but its best to go to the dr and see if there isnt a underlying problem such as an infection|`|3bfwSDRtaa	well when i had my first pregnancy my period came for one day i cant remember about the cramping i didn't know what to expect but come to realize i missed my period and went to the doctor come to find out i was pregnant so yes it sounds like you just might be pregnant please follow up with me cause i would like to know im trying to conceive my self.|`|QUL1QWb9aa	well let me tell you somthing if you are worried about your situacion you should definatley check your self to see the doctor because if its really bothing you and its important do it *** soon as possible .And second if you did it and knew you coulndt and your parents find out about your pain and sickness and take you to check it there self then that would be worse have patience and go see the doctor as soon as possible .But first you should take a pregnetcy test!to see if there is a possibility that it might be true then ...if i comes out eigther way go to the doctor because he will have a definte answer ok if anythin YOU NEED  help ON you need contact me at romanemely@yahoo.com ok take care !

ibWLdXlJaa	I would say just to keep trying. For some reason he finds it funny but he won't always so I would enjoy it while it's there.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Well for starters you can't laugh at him....lol If you laugh at him he will just do it more. If you don't pay any attention to it he will stop because my 9 month old did the same thing.|`|AA12243380	Nah, it's just a short stage.    That being said, if you want to avoid him doing it to get that giggle out of you then stop giggling when he does it and when he gets bored with the new thing he can do with his mouth he'll stop doing it.|`|qusZuvqoaa	well he does it to get a rsponse out of you, in this case laughter, if you dont laugh but get all serious than he may stop doing it because he will know it is bad/wrong to do it.|`|Zyl2wBnPaa	that's what babies do when they're eating    eventually he'll learn to eat better

TdiuwtM5aa	she might have a cold but i would take her to the doctor to make sure she didn't pick up any other symptoms.|`|u12eVaDhaa	It could be her teeth, or it could be a cold that is taking longer to clear.  The key thing is, is she otherwise fit and well?  Is she as lively as usual, happy to play and run around as usual?  If she is then I would give it at least another week before you take her to the Doctors.  You're breastfeeding her and there is NOTHING better for a cold, or indeed teething, than breastmilk.  Best wishes|`|O7X7W1Mnaa	I would certainly get her checked out.  When my son was 17 months old, he got a runny nose that lasted about 5 days, and of all the times we took his temperature, he only had a fever once. He eventually started having difficulty breathing at night due to the drainage.  We had him checked out and his Oxygen level was in the 70s.  He had gotten a really bad case of RSV and was hospitalized for a week (over Christmas, no less).
eceLQUj5aa	Have you tried talking calmly to him? Ask him why he keeps doing it, what can mommy do to help you feel better? It probably is that he is feeling stressed and left out with all the hostility that you may subconsciously be throwing off. When was the last time you two did something special with each other? Like a mom and son day out?    Most importantly you have to make the clear distinction that if he wants attention from mommy in the future that biting is not the way to do it. Check out nanny 911, i know that sounds dumb but they have dealt very well with some very violent youngsters.|`|i4ceTwqLaa	Have you actually sat with him and explained why biting is so wrong on so many levels?    -It is painful to the other children  -He can get kicked out of daycare  -He can get sick, or make the other child sick  -The kids will stop playing with him  -He will get severely punished at home for doing it....    Consistency will be key here. EVERY time he bites, there must be a major and immediate reaction. Especially at home.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I think every toddler goes through this at one point. I would just firmly say no biting when he does this and if he does it again make him sit in a time out. Before letting him leave time out i would make him sit on my lap and explain to him that you can not bite people because it hurts them and he doesnt want to hurt his friends. I would also let the daycare provider know that you are going through a divorce and he may be acting out because of it. They should deff understand. Goodluck =)|`|DkVofG9paa	bite him and ask him how that feels? and tell him it's not nice and it hurts other kids.  it has been known to work before..|`|4DoXomHZaa	It's going to be extremely difficult for YOU to do it, since you're not there, just paid sitters.    All you could do is tell the workers to put him in timeout when he does it, but of course they can't watch all the kids as well as one on one...and since they are not mom, the discipline may not work very well.|`|49d74bd8b100117274d25e31b1942932aa	don't blame it on divorce proceedings because i'm almost certain that isn't it.  maybe another one at his daycare is doing it - its his way to defend himself.. children learn from one another.  Its really up to the dc provider to spend aday being as close to him as she can   and try to catch him everytime(which, is impossible) but - its hard for YOU to punish when it happens in the day - sometimes they don't understand.  3 yr old's should understand - but, decide w/ the daycare what should be done at her house right after it happens.|`|MmugX89aaa	well talk to him/her and tell them its not right.  ground them if yu have to.  by the way.  make them understand that yur going thriugh a tough time to.|`|c1Bina0uaa	Well, I think that the divorce might be a slight percentage of the problem. I dont have children but I'm very experienced and I'm going to college to work with early education and childhood development. When children are told that they are doing something wrong or that they are misbehaving, this is the way that they react. Being gentle with them is of course the best idea, but remember it is a phase and that you have to be understanding because this is how they express how they feel.|`|tv7a1ixiaa	Ask him if he would like to be bitten himself, cause other kids don't. Say that if he continues then you will have to call the naughty police! And if he continues, pretend to call the "naughty police".|`|S9U2FtZdaa	I have 2 boys, one 10 and one 2 years old, with both my boys, i have tried the time out thing but with biting it does not seem to work, when my boys tried to bite me, i bit them back, not hard, but enough to let them know that its not something they want done to them, and it stopped, no more biting..but if your 3 yr old is doing it only at daycare, then they need to do something there, and it could have something to do with your divorce but i would say not because 3 is the right time for kids to go through that biting stage.  Just let your 3 yr old know it is not acceptable.|`|UIsGz8kTaa	Do not bite him.... by biting him you are modeling a behavior that shouldn't be modelled evan if you are trying to make a point. Biting other children is his way of letting his frustrations out. You could tell the teacher's that as soon as he bites the other children to put him in time-out and also display a behavior and gesture that is suppose to happen when he is frustrated. Show and tell him that if he gets frustrated to run over to the teacher and tell her. When and if he does this make it a big big deal... like get really excited. When 3 year olds get excitement out of people they will do it again. Tell him not to bite and why. Because it hurts the other children. Tell him that you love him and that he needs to do a good thing. Or everyday he doesnt bite make a good choices chart and add a sticker for every good day. When it reaches five stickers give him a toy or treat. This does work... I work at a preschool.
7tAH3GEBaa	Decided that formula was going to have to do.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Well my son used to bite. At first I tried the "ouch! That hurts mummy" after putting him down. That worked for the first 2 teeth. Now when he bites...usually when he's teething...I bring him in, meaning I smother him with my breast until he lets go. Trying to break a latch while 9 teeth are bearing down on your nipple is no easy feat. Bringing him in blocks his nose for a second, this causes him to let go since the need to breath is more important than the want to bite. After he lets go,   I say "ouch! That hurts mummy" in a stern voice, put him down and do my bra back up. When he's truly ready to nurse he won't bite. DS now has 9 teeth and is 13 1/2 months old. I have no plans to wean him yet, I'll let himself wean|`|Bw18seFqaa	Not from personal experience, but I was told that when your little one bites down too hard, tell her "NO", and use your finger to un-suction her.    It will be difficult at first, and you may have a fussy baby, she wont be happy about it.. but she will learn that if she bites down, she gets the nipple taken away.  Babies are not dumb!|`|0F3u5RpTaa	I screamed really loud as I was not expecting such a thing.  Baby jumped away, started crying, went back to breast and never, and I mean never did that again.  I breast fed her till she was over 1 year old.
5Crovdoaaa	I sounds like thrush, which is a yeast infection in the mouth. You'll have to take her back to the dr. and they'll prescribe either Penicillinlin or Nystatin if that's what it is.|`|AA11304279	Thrush comes right after hand foot and mouth the dr should have given you an antibotic for this too cuz it follows right after it. should be a medicine that you swish in your mouth to coat the tongue and cheeks normal spots for it to be. also when it starts to break up use a new toothbrush to soften it and loosen it then of course throw it away when it is totally gone. this is very painful to kids.|`|GeMenejZaa	it could be thrush?|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	hello christina, take her to the doctor, or just call your family doctor and see if its all good i dont know but white stuff reminds me of that sids, you dont want that do goto the doc.|`|PRg9UgOlaa	It does sound like thrush. Common yeast infection in the mouth. Call the doctor and get her some antibiotics! Good luck to you!|`|Qoq0twVaaa	Tell her to stop licking the freezer :P
44OH7Si6aa	I tried potty training the traditional way with pull-ups but my kids are apparently lazy when it comes to pottying and would much rather pee in the pull-up than take time to go to the potty. So we decided to do a crash course in potty training. I washed all of their clothes and bought lots of underwear, then I took the pull ups off. They still used them at night, but couldn't wear them during the day. On the first day they will pee in their pants alot. Undress them, give them a quick bath to clean up , then put underwear and pants back on. You will hate the first day of it, they will do a little better the following day. By the fourth or fifth day both of my kids were accident free. My daughter took so well to it that she gave up the pull up at night the following week.|`|AA11210211	Wait until he is ready and when he is encourage him.There is nothing you can do to MAKE him go but encourage him,believe me he won't be in diapers forever,I never thought my son would go on the potty and he has been going for a little over a week now and he is almost 3 1/2.Just be patient,it will happen in time:)|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	Tell him every time he uses the big potty you will give him a dollar.  It will add up.|`|lWyux6nuaa	the bigest thing is be patient!  kids will enjoy using the potty more when they arent pressured or yelled at to do so.    im not sure if this will work but...  my dad told me one time that if you put a cheerio in the toilet and teach the kid that its fun he might do it    you should teach him to aim at the cheerio in the toilet that way he will think of it as a game and he will focus on aiming in the toilet and not at the walls haha.      hope this helps|`|rt4OnxkYaa	dont push!!! let him go at his own pace or you will run into a lot of problems!!!!!! encourage him by getting a little potty for him and if he does go.. reward him.. but dont rush !|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Okay, same answer I just gave someone else.    Poop is the first thing a baby makes all by himself...his first creative act.  Have you been positive about this achievement?    I think I would start a daily family "best looking poop in the toiler contest", with the winner getting some little treat each day. Each participant gets a turn as judge, but the judge has to say why it is the best poop (biggest, stinkiest, best shape, most unusual color or whatever. Don't even suggest he take part, just welcome him into the game when he wants in.    You may think I am kidding, but too many parents unconsciously communicate disgust with the process and result of digestion and some kids pick up on this by just pretending it isn't happening and just want nothing to do with it.  Kids should not be made to feel bad, dirty or self hating about any natural part of life. There can be joy in dumping a nice poop.     And farts are the original joke.  Have fun with them, too.    I once helped my little sister get through some very bad intestinal flue we both had, by making a silly game out of throwing up. We both ended up laughing while upchucking, and it wasn't nearly so bad after that.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|X0fBpbRBaa	well first get a seat the attracts his a tension and then if he sit award him with something hes always wanted  then you got him and if he dose not hold  well then you got to threaten him but not too much  just say  if you don't sit down your not going to so & so  and if he sits before that than "Yay you did it champ, where you wanna any where you want"|`|e5CuEiPfaa	I did the same thing as elynwyn and just put my daughter in underwear and she did not like the feeling of the wetness against her. Also, kids love incentives such as stickers, candy, etc. Maybe something like that will help. I used M&M's and my daughter finally got it in her head that she got them after she went and pottied and started going on the potty just to get the M&M's. Good luck!
ROJans2Taa	thick discharge is normal during pregnancy, and of course so is nausea, even though they call it morning sickness most times it's throughout the day and some people have it all through their pregnancy, I had alot of cramps during my first trimester, it felt like a bad period, i also had some bleeding, which is actually common, I wouldn't worry, my son is almost 5 mths now, each pregnancy is different, my first I sort of breezed through it, my second was alot of cramps, spotting, aches all over, nausea got me during second trimester, best luck|`|HunSyQaSaa	I think this something you need to ask your ob/gyn doc.Morning sickness can last for 9 months but there is help.|`|sa0EwdvEaa	i get it too esp the discharge it sucks...cant even go for a walk, i wear panty liners, it helps!|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	As soon as you said discharge I stopped reading.  I don't want to freak you out but I think you need to call your doctor and tell him or her what's going on.    I started spotting with my first pregnancy and then passing small clots.  I miscarried, but I'm not saying it will be the case with you.   In any event please call your doctor, he or she should know these things.|`|foOKenTiaa	welcome to being pregnent :) your more then likely perfectly fine but if your really worried ask your doctor|`|UwIpnN2Iaa	I'd call the doctor.. brownish discharge could have blood in it, I would want to ask about that.     Are you taking prenatal vitamins at night? My doctor had me switch to Flintstones vitamins for a while in the beginning because the prenatal ones were making me too sick. She told me to try taking them at night first, but it didn't work.     It does seem odd for morning sickness to have gotten better already, unless you've changed your diet or eating patterns to cope with it. See what your doctor says! Good luck.|`|y1p6Bo9laa	visit your doctor asap dont waste your time on yahoo answers|`|KxBPpzgIaa	I THINK ALL THIS IS NORMAL. I AM 7 WEEKS PREG AND 1 DAY. I HAVE ALOT OF DISCHARGE MY BF SIAD THIS IS NORMAL SO I THINK ALL THIS STUFF IS NORMAL. IF YOU START BLEEDING I WOULD DEF SEE YOUR DOCTOR|`|Xn33r741aa	Honestly I think that you should be okay. I am 21 weeks pregnant now and I had all the same things that you stated you have. I did have my nausea a lot longer but it is different with each person, consider yourself lucky if you are getting better all ready. If you start spotting bright blood or have cramping that seems really severe then contact your dr. asap. Otherwise I would just give them a call and ask them a couple questions to ease your mind. Pregnancy can be a scary time.. But try to relax as stress isn't good for you or your growing baby. Rest at ease and give your dr. a call i'm sure its nothing though!|`|PnZigfgHaa	The first thing you need to do is calm down - it really sounds like everything is fine    Firstly, a brownish discharge is common in early pregnancy but mention it when you see your midwife or GP.    Secondly, morning sickness varies in intensity bu usually continues throughout the whole of the first three months - its rare but some ladies also get it throughout their pregnancy.    Finally, cramps come with the territory also, don't panic about them.    Hope all continues to go well  Good luck x|`|qi6mAsCZaa	Morning sickness usually starts around week 7 (give or take) and can last up to about week 13-14 or even through the whole pregnancy. I know it's scary, but you have to try not to worry...it's really bad for the baby. I am 13 weeks pregnant and have had to take med's to stop the vomiting because I was staying dehydrated. If it were an ectopic pregnancy, you would have abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, fainting, and dizziness. You can have your doctor do your sonogram if you haven't already had one and feel better. Your doctor would be able to tell right away where the baby is.    I hope this helps and try not to worry!!!    Good luck and congrats!
s4LWmcTjaa	Yes.  It makes my heart wrench with pain.  The only "good" thing of abortion is that every last unborn baby that is killed is with Jesus.    Abortion is horrible.  This mouth of mine speaks for the ones who cannot speak themselves.  Someone has to speak for them.    For the person who says "one less unwanted baby, one less baby to be abused, etc"..... If someone does not want a baby then they should not be having sex to begin with.  Besides, there are many many couples out there dying for a baby.  Give the baby to one of them!    http://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-feta...|`|723QHuicaa	Take this somewhere else. Perhaps the politics section.    Oh yeh, and Im reporting you... For 2 reasons.  1 - this isnt a question  2 - you posted this to piss people off|`|52bAHCaUaa	Abortion in general makes me sad...however whoever wrote this doesn't know how a baby develops in the womb.|`|rAkWoweOaa	That is very very sad.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Not really.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i have heard this before   and it is sooo sad   abortion is sad|`|DNygQdmVaa	its not colpletely correct,  but yes its sad.    people are heartless.|`|8VJwoGXKaa	That is very sad, and I've seen this before and the person who wrote it doesn't know squat about how unborn babies develop.  At month one it's 8 inches long??? No!!! The baby is just the size of a little peanut then!|`|5DJcir9saa	Its not completely correct but very sad.  Abortion in itself is very sad.  Everyone has their right to choose, but if you make that choice it just shows how selfish you are.  If you are pregnant and don't want the baby there are plenty of people in this country who do and are unable to have them on their own, so surrender nine months of your life and allow that baby to grow.  There is no excuse for abortion when there are so many people willing to adopt and readily available birth control regardless of how much money you make.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	It makes me sad/angry that you believe all those lies about a foetus's level of awareness.    Everything you've said is pure religious-superstition dressed up in false pseudo-science.  Beliefs such as yours have had a devastating impact upon the lives of millions of abused women - and infringed the rights of more fortunate women.|`|ly59dQ3gaa	it's heartbreaking.  i'm 38 weeks pregnant with my second child, a son.  each child is a gift from God.  changing 'what should be' is nothing more than shaking your fist to God/Karma/Fate/Universe/whatever higher power you would like to call Him.|`|Rd3IivxCaa	abortion is more than just the horrific act.  It has changed society.  We now think every death is meaningless unless it hits really close to home.    Life is cheapened, because we don't give a rat's *** about our own babies.    The reason there was columbine and 20 similar massacres and the reason people love to watch blood and guts is because abortion has taught 2 generations of Americans to hate life.|`|eZQ45iDzaa	abortion is horrible!!!|`|kT72QtHPaa	Holy geez!    When I started reading this I was like...pfftt..  But I almost cried!    Very sad, and should be stopped, its MURDER.|`|awRNr2VMaa	yes it does i think its very sad. it goes around myspace every few weeks i just ignore it now theres nothing you can do about abortion so i just dont talk about it|`|u12eVaDhaa	One less child that was UNWANTED, one less child to be ABUSED, one less child to be HURT and grow into an adult that will hurt others.

BUT its still good.|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	it does make me very sad,ive heard it before and it was chilling then too.  it makes me just want to hold my daughter and cuddle her.|`|DbFjaY0Iaa	Yes!!! omg thats sad!!! =(|`|4AEhBAMBaa	Yes,its makes me cry!!!!! This is how society is,they don't get that it is a "baby"from the time of conception.My opinion is if you didn't want a baby then don't have sex.In the case of rape;its not the child's fault give him/her up for adoption.There are lots of people who would love to have a child and can't.|`|bTcdX9uHaa	yeah not believable, you dont do an abortion at six months!  but sad i suppose...|`|b5ad6e44e0086d316700f9b6713407c6aa	No, because it's ridiculous. A 1 month old embryo is NOT 8 inches long, doesn't have arms or legs, and doesn't resemble a "baby" in any way. You wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a human embryo at this time and a dog embryo. Lips and tongue are only beginning to develop in a 2 month old embryo, so there would be no thumb-sucking.    Maybe someone should write something like this about the people who are dying for no reason in wars- people who are BORN and have RIGHTS, unlike a fetus.    Maybe people should also keep their noses out of other people's reproductive organs.    If you don't like abortion, don't have one. Pretty simple.|`|AA12243380	Awww!  That didn't make me cry but it did make me sad.|`|68QSpCVFaa	it is sad but i didnt cry and it wasnt correct if the baby was in the mothers stomach then it wouldnt have hair or grown as fast as it did in that short story. abortion is terrible but usually is only done by people who cant take care of a baby. i dont like abortion,but you cant do anything about it unless you have alot of authority so you might as well not think about it if it makes you sad. again,it makes me sad too but crying about it is uneccicary if you are making yourself cry by looking at it.|`|XxRKLyqLaa	The abortion question is really hard to talk about cause your killing a human being but this decision is not for us to take the only person who can take this decision is the person doing it.  I'm a mother of 2 and I'm not against it. why should a person that got raped not have the Choice to abort. and way is it that a person who knows there not fit to have a baby have to keep it cause its not moral to have an abortion ???? what you rather have kids being unhappy cause there parents didn't want them?     yes there's somme ppl that use abortion as a contraception and are idiots to do that but you can't say things like that and not get it back.
Xnr5Y7Coaa	I'm glad you used a condom and that means your aware that safe sex is important.  The fact that your period isn't regulated yet tells me that you are quite young and that you should have a nice talk with your parents or a knowledgeable adult who can give you more info.  I don't think you're pregnant. If the condom did it's job then you should be fine. Wait a little for your period to come, if it doesn't come then you need to take a pregnancy test.|`|RjoCYCkQaa	Ask your dad this question.|`|WxEmrNAOaa	you are not pregnant! always use a condom x|`|NxNrZksXaa	it is too soon to know if you are pregnant or not. it takes 2 weeks for implantation to occur, and 2-3 for symptoms to show from the time you had sex. the cramps you are experiencing are probably pms symptoms. your period might be delayed though if you stress about being pregnant, but stop stressing because you are fine! :)|`|b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	its too early to tell if your pregnant. Sounds like your period is just on its way. Don't worry.|`|kcGFK36Waa	a test.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	most likely 0%|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Take a test or your period may be coming if you are getting cramps.

Talk with your mom and go to a GYN to make sure everything is working correctly. You should have your periods regular after at least the first 6 months of having them. If they are missing months then you really need to see a dr.
c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	I am sure your doctor would not have mislead you. The technology is very advanced and if the dye did not travel through the tube the way it should your doctor can assess your odds of conceiving. My tubes showed blockage like yours and I never conceived naturally. Even if you conceived in the past, your blockage could have formed later. I would get a second opinion for peace of mind. The other poster is right about narrow tubes and finding a RE (reproductive endocrinologist) if you haven't. Ask about corrective surgery and if IVF or surgery would give you better odds to conceive. One important thing to know is that when your tubes are blocked your risk for a tubal pregnancy greatly increases when TTC naturally. Also, you do risks a tubal pregnancy with IVF. I had a tubal pregnancy via IVF and lost one tube. Odds are not high, under 2%, but it is a risks. Do ask your doctor or RE about hydrosalpinx. This is where your tubes are filled with a toxic fluid. If you have hydros, it is highly advised that you have them removed before TTC.    I am sorry you didn't get better news today. I do wish you luck.|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	Am sorry.get another opinion.ask her if its not possible to do surgery to repair them.    good luck|`|QGTqlppGaa	MAYBE ALL THAT SHOUTING HAS MADE YOU INFERTILE.|`|KjzUDcF8aa	this means that your baby has entered the uterus wall up your fillopian tube there is a small chance of fatality x_x but as i said its very small you should go to another doctor and get another test|`|Ql44BXFHaa	hsg test is ok but not definitive.  even when it shows your tubes are open there could be other issues with your tubes.  my hsg was read as open but very, very small.  i went to re and he suggested a lap to determine extent of problems.  he ended up removing 1 tube due to the amount of scar tissue and clearing a lot more scar tissue from the other tube and cavity.  i recommend seeing a re and getting that opinion.  your doc may be good but if this is not his speciality i'd seek the advise of an expert.  after the lap i did clomid for 3 cycles over 6 months and i just started my ivf meds.  btw, i did get pregnant prior to the lap with severely blocked tubes so it is possible...  my re doesn't think my chances w/o ivf are good so that's why we are moving forward.  if it works it will be well worth the money and pain...

4D1VEKW5aa	Test was taken too early to detect hcg, hcg level were too low to be detected at the time the test was taken. Thats pretty reasonable and logical.    I dont know that there are any drugs that can affect levels of hcg while pregnant, nor someones emotional state.
AaP7o0Ufaa	I'm sorry, I don' t have coupons, but I have some advice.  My doctor prescribed Vitamin D for my breastfed son.  At the pharmacy they TriViSol instead, because it had Vitamin D in it & was cheaper, so I got it & I paid an arm & leg for it.  I gave it to him for 2 weeks & he didn't poop the entire time!  There was too much iron in there for him or something.  It was frightening when he would try to poop & cry & nothing would come out.  I stopped using it & still have almost an entire unused, expired bottle of it now.  I don't know what to say about those & this really doesn't answer your question, but I had to share. :)|`|VClxXNs3aa	I believe there was a coupon inside the box......  maybe if you go to the store and ask the cashier if you can open it before you buy it(but are gonna buy it.) they will let you open and take the coupon out.    ETA.... the coupon database at hotcouponworld,com ((great site)) says ...    Enfamil Vi-Sol vitamin drops $2.00/1 12/31/2009 Inside Package  Baby/Children     there is a $2 coupon inside the box. expires 12/31/09....|`|6hA0O06xaa	To answerer above, they sell it with or without iron.  get it without.|`|u12eVaDhaa	Unless you are very undernourished breastfed babies do not require vitamin supplementation.  Contact any breastfeeding charity and they will tell you this.  www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk  www.llli.org  www.kellymom.com  Best wishes|`|XxRKLyqLaa	go on the web page of tri vi sol and maybe theres some there that you can print up ? but if you breast feed why do you need those vitamins I never used those for my kids and there healthy?|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	look up a the company and check their websites. ALSO check out the label there might be the same thing cheaper. I think the company is lil tummies or somthing they make a degaser for babies and its cheaper then mylicon and I also saw one that is all natural from another company..this was all after I paid for he mylicon and opened it. So I cant remember to well hope that helps.      My ped told me to give that to my son as well when I was bf cause bf babies dont get the vit. offered in it. formula has it all. You have to remember the milk is being produced by you and your intake.       I read the first answer if the store clerk wont let you open it get the coupon and pay then ask them if you buy something and come back with a coupon will they do the credit.*THEY SHOULD* so then buy it then open it get teh coupon and have them credit you back. OR if you have the cash just open it and take out the coupon and close the box and proced to cash out as normal.
oEOo9U7iaa	Yes. It's called coitus interruptus.  Have him pull out before jack-ul-ation.|`|AA10811784	Go to Planned Parenthood.|`|AA11223036	alot of times u can go to the doctor and they will have samples of certain kinds especially if you let him know you dont have insuarance. and if you wouldnt like the doctor bill always try local health departments they are free there and give out other types of birth control also|`|AA11783622	If you are under 18 , Free at Planned Parenthood.  Google them + your city for their numbers.  Make an appt, walk in have a little talk and they are yours!!!!!    Any African women would wait a week  27/7 for free pills.... but alas, in the countryside, there are no clinics, so she has her first baby at about age 14, and 13 more pregnancies in her life time with 9 live births.... and she is usually dead before she is 45.|`|oXCo6VX4aa	Go to Planned Parenthood.  They usually charge on a sliding scale.  One caution, if you are a student in a state that says you have to have insurance (like MA), don't tell them that you are a student.  If you do, they will charge you full price.    When I was younger and had no insurance I got lots of free samples and low cost birth-control pills from them, as well as low cost exams.  Good Luck!
mjz8JF9Gaa	unfortunatly most of them dont consider   it a baby unti its born   even tho a baby is a baby at conception|`|723QHuicaa	No.    Im pro choice and i beleive its always a baby.    But there is a huge difference between a 6wk fetus, and a viable premamture baby - hence why it is illegal to abort a baby at the age of viability.    Now, I believe these guidelines should be lowered, but thats how they are.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	i think they say 23 weeks which is considered the viable point however 21 week babies have survived.|`|AA12057835	I am pro choice, but only under certain circumstances.  If the mother was raped or severely beaten/attacked and a doctor has proven that the fetus might not live (or have a poor chance at surviving after birth), or if a doctor has proven that the mother's health would be in jeopardy....these would be the reasons why I would see abortions as acceptable.  It should never be used as a form of birth control|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	hmmm I am pro choice and I might be alone in this, but I GUESS I could possibly come to the realization that there is a baby in there when it starts to move or I see the ultrasound.  I am pregnant now :-) due in about 3 months, and I can't wait :-) BUT I am the kinda person who needs to see something to believe it, although she is moving and I have seen the ultrasound (which was exciting) but to me I have to give birth and have her in my arms.  To me the baby is not a baby until its here.  Which probably makes it alot easier for me cause if I were to miscarry or anything like that I probably wouldn't be as upset about it as someone else might be, which I don't think would make me heartless, I just need to see things to believe them, not JUST the ultrasound I need her to be here and be able to hold her.  but I think differently on lot of things then most people.     Basically I need her right in front of me to make it real.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	baby is a term of endearment, not a proper term. the real question is, is when is the fetus a person. personhood begins at birth, but in my opinion, personhood STARTS at viability, which is 24 weeks gestation, which is when the fetus is sentient and able to feel pain.|`|c73QkZ2haa	Im pro-choice but would never make that choice myself.     I personally feel a baby exists from the moment of conception but its not my place to force someone else to beleive the same thing. Everyone has a right to make their own choices concerning their bodies, their beliefs and their lives.|`|1Xhtxt6Haa	I believe that after the conception occurs, that is the start of a life. The only reason I believe a woman should have the right to choose abortion is in an extreme case such as rape. If a woman was raped and it causes her to get pregnant and she has severe emotional damage, it would be terrible if she was told she HAS to carry the baby. What if she decides to do something stupid like purposely harm or kill herself or the baby (or both)? In that case I think it should be allowed. I do not believe in abortion as a form of birth control.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I am pro-choice and I think that a baby is a baby when it enters the embryonic stage of development - around 4 weeks.      What many pro-life people don't seem to understand is that people who are pro-choice aren't pro-abortion.  I personally wouldn't want anyone to have an abortion, but it's not my place to tell someone what they can and cannot do, or what they must or mustn't do.  I also don't live in a world that is so black and white that things are always or never a certain way.  I believe that there are gray areas that I will never know anything about and since I don't, won't or can't understand them, it's unfair of me to pass judgments on those gray areas.    Edit: Questions for you - let's say a woman has an amnio and finds out that her child has a defect that is incompatible with life and the baby will certainly die in-utero or within days of birth.  Would you force that woman to carry that baby knowing it was going to die?  How about a woman who is 15 weeks along and finds she has severe preeclampsia and if the baby isn't taken out, she'll die.  There's no way a 15 week old baby can survive, so would you have her give birth to that baby so it could suffer for hours before it finally died?  Or would you say that an abortion where the fetus is killed instantly would be better?  Also, unless you have been raped and bore the child of that rape, I think it's rather presumptuous to assume anything about how a person in that situation would feel.|`|Tp3jOpc7aa	I consider a baby alive whenever it can live on its own without its mothers body. I think that's 23 weeks? And actually nurturing your rapist spawn inside you for 9 months won't cause emotional damage? Knowing that every second it is sucking the nutrients out of you and growing in your abdomen isn't enough to cause emotional damage i don't know what will. If anything she will be relieved the parasite is out of her and she doesn't have to worry about morning sickness, stretch marks, maternity clothes, maternity leave, adoption process, and the chance of it finding her one day looking for its real mom, or labor.
AA10811784	I am not a fan of the digital HPT's. I had a false positive with one.     I would wait a few more days. If your period does not come by then, get another HPT, but do not get a digital.     Good luck.|`|AA10186411	Could go either way.  Digital tests though, have a higher rate of false positives.  Mainly because they include electronics in them, not just simple litmus paper. I have had a digital test read positive and I was not pregnant.  I asked a doctor I work with about this the other day, and he said digital tests are worthless.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	Yeah, there test could wrong. Try to test again in the morning! Good luck!|`|ZoYPbHj3aa	First Response Digital is very accurate.
VayJue7vaa	I think Leigh is a much better as a middle name than a last name.

E7ViD8EWaa	No, he would need a sufficient reason that would hold up in court. They usually prefer the baby to stay with it's mother in most cases, so even if he were to take you to court for custody, you would probably win.     He can't just take full custody without a good reason.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	I don't believe that he can.    And, I know that it is easier said than done but, my instincts tell me that you should dump this guy. He doesn't seem to care about you and he isn't worth your time and worrying.|`|DNygQdmVaa	No he cannot do that.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Nope, I don't believe he can. And if he is pressuring you with threats I would advice you to leave him, cause he sounds like a d**che|`|Uh9LIVksaa	Not unless he goes to the court and the judge gives him full custody, which is extremely rare. Women usually get custody in court cases.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Courts generally feel that a baby should be with his mother unless she's declared unfit.|`|i2yM0T9Paa	I don't think that its legal for him to take the baby out of state. Unless you are physically harming the baby (I'm sure your not) they wont take the baby away from the mother. And they sure wont let the dad just up and take him out of state without the mothers consent.|`|hJX6Ur3taa	No but if he tries, you mom should press charges for statutory rape.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no i dont thinks so...that would only happen if you were found to be an unfit mother. hes a jerk IMO...he does not love you if thats the cheap threats hes throwing at you. let him go.....without you if he fights it then so be it. goodluck.|`|XwrjRj52aa	Unless he gets full custody, which is highly unlikely, then it's kidnapping.|`|c61c4f44c63edf2ae9007329580c8a0faa	Not unless you use drugs or drink and abuse the baby.  He would have to go to court for that though.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	he can't do that, don't worry. he's just trying to scare you by acting as if he knows what he's talking about. luckily for you he doesn't. he has no rights to your baby. he's not married to you for one thing, he would have to prove he's the father for another, and most courts would never separate a baby from it's mother.|`|sq9AtIRHaa	Nope he can't. Take him to court and make sure you get full custody before he does. I don't think he can though; since you two are broken up and you are carrying & caring for the baby. I am also broken up with my baby daddy and I know how much of a pain in the a*s they can be sometimes! If you need anyone to talk to, please email me :) Good luck.
Fy9S6hjIaa	Oh...I so had that when I was pregnant.  It hurt pretty bad to sneeze or cough.  I asked my doctor about it and she said that it was round ligament pains.  The ligaments that hold your uterus in stretch alot when your preggers and the pressure of sneezing or coughing can cause really sharp pains in the lower abdomen.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I get that too. They way I avoid it is whenever I feel a sneeze coming on I  bring my knees towards my chest and it really helps.|`|LABC73E7aa	i had that when i sneezed and coughed when i was around 15-17 wks and i was fine. my sneezes and coughs were just so intense!|`|2323179298623bfb1098bd225a86137eaa	You should probably report any unusual pain to your doc just to be safe. But it could be your ligaments stretching. Around 19 weeks I had "round ligament pain" in that area which made it incredibly difficult to walk for about 2 weeks and hurt when I coughed and sneezed. It did subside though once everything stretched out. But make sure you ask your doc.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	It's called round ligament pain. I get it when I sneeze, cough too hard, or even when I change positions. My doc said it's perfectly normal and not a problem unless I notice that I'm having pain while lying or sitting still, without sneezing or coughing. It's growing pains honey, you're ok.|`|bsge5nZPaa	It is your round ligaments! I am 39 weeks pregnant and I still get them!! And there are some times that when you stand up to fast you will get that pain!! They are just stretching and making room for your growing baby!! =)    Congrats and good luck|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Im 16 weeks friday and the same goes for me but its normal it happened with my other 2 pregnancies also....|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Its normal, im 25 weeks and i still get that pain when i sneeze sometimes. I think its just from putting sudden pressure on your uterus and makes it stretch a little.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Round ligament pain.    It's a b*tch, and it gets worse.    It's normal though, and you're fine.    Congrats and good luck!! :)|`|mdmSrQ5paa	haha i get the same thing, as well as when i cough and pee too fast    it's just the muscles in your abdomen stretching and contracting quickly   sometimes if the baby is down low and it happens it the uterus will tighten up around the baby and scare him or her   causing them to do a little freak sesh   but it's nothing to worry about   you will get all sorts of weird aches and pains through out pregnancy  if any severe prolonged pains occur however  that's when you want to call your doctor   i hope this helped  i wish the best for you and your babe!|`|vgD95DLCaa	probably the baby pushing on your bladder...|`|tEVBnSWkaa	i am 17 weeks pregnant to and i get them pains all the time i think it has something to do with the legman's in your belly stretching to make room for the baby is perfectly normal|`|QSodlfMraa	i really dont know what it is but i do have that sometimes.  i dont think its anything to worry about, i ask my mother and she  said the samething happen to her with me and my brothers and we all came out find.|`|ROJans2Taa	when I had a bad cold during my second trimester, every time I would cough it was like someone stabbed me in my abdomen, it could just be ligaments or muscle, everything is under stress already so the jolt of a sneeze just aggravates things, I wouldn't worry, I had 3 bad colds during my pregnancy and would get sharp pains every time I coughed/sneezed, best luck|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I get that too. And when I cough.|`|MqFeJiukaa	Its round ligament pain.  You get that mid pregnancy because your uterus is stretching to make room for your baby.

3EhoJ42zaa	Babies and young children can sense change and when something big is going to happen.  My son is 13 months and I am 37 weeks, the past couple of days he has been in the worst moods.  Just keep explaining how he cannot and never will be replaced.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	It is possible that he is just scared or think that he is getting replaced....or maybe he just so happens to have entered his terrible 2's at the same time.    But quite frankly, I think it is more probable that the closer you get to your due date, the more uncomfortable you feel, the less are are able and willing to do.  So the poor little guy might just be having a hard time adjusting to the fact that mama isn't necessarily as attentive or responsive to him as before...|`|IsnHXRo4aa	Children are amazingly and subconciously perceptive. If you look back I bet you'd notice that his behavior started to change before you even knew you were pregnant. Hormones and pheromones have something to do with it. His tantrums may or may not be related to new baby coming, most likely they are but are also a combination of other factors as well.     Two is the most challenging age there is. He is just starting to realize that life exists outside his little world, that other people have an effect on him and that what he does has an effect on others as well. He is starting to understand what choices are and will want to make a lot of his own. Many times they are choices you disagree with, and this is simply because he wants some control over his world. Empower him and give him choices he can make. Let him pick out his clothes, meals, activities etc. If you are sure you won't like a choice he might make, give him a couple things to pick from: Would you like chicken and broccoli or chicken and carrots? Talk to him about all the responsibility he will have being a big brother, and all the things he can do (helping change diapers, holding bottles, etc) Make sure once baby is here you and daddy both spend special time just with him. It's going to be a tough time, I won't lie but keep positive and consistent because it's also a lot of fun.|`|u12eVaDhaa	Hi, my daughter was 22m when my son was born, so I can remember how worried about her feelings I was.  The best way you can encourage your son is to involve him.  So what about getting him to choose his best books that he can help you read to the baby.  You could even read to your 'bump' together.  This will help you breastfeed as well.  Basically he sits beside you and does the important job of turning the pages and showing baby the pictures while you read the text.  Then you can breastfeed as well.  I did this with my daughter and I got her to choose the books to 'read' to the baby.  She did the sound effects as well - cows 'mooing' etc.    Other times I got her to get the wipes when I changed him.  Or fetch me ANYTHING even if I didn't need it.  It made her feel so important and so vital to his well-being.  She loved it.  They really bonded.    Anyway all the very best of luck to you all.
aLAmvX5Naa	Instead of sending a baby shower invite to out of state people who you KNOW can't come, why not just send a photo copy of the ultrasound photo and say "Sara and Kevin Smith are expecting a baby girl 6/7/2009".    Sending a registry card to out of state people basically says "Hey, Sara wants gifts"    Edit: The Kodak photo maker that all the stores have can make a nice copy of the ultrasound and you can even write on it with the machine. Make a bunch of copies that way.
F8iyUqJBaa	It's called round ligament pain and it is common.  It can come on in the middle of your belly, on the sides or underneath and it hurts like you said.  I will calm down but it takes a while.  It's like pulling a muscle, only not as severe.  You could have switched positions to fast, gotten out of bed to quickly, any number of things.  This will continue throughout and usually only get more frequent.  No worries, just your growing uterus.|`|812874d02f72331b1d1a4fa6424dc06daa	The pains you are getting are more than likely being caused by your uterus expanding to accommodate your baby. Throughout your pregnancy, you will experience sharp cramp-like pains on both sides. This is nothing to worry about. I had the same thing and this is what the doctor told me. Congratulations and good luck!|`|YJbih8siaa	Your so inconsistant!|`|dR2bqUixaa	That's a good question cuz the same thing is happening to me and I'm only 12 weeks and 2 days pregnant.|`|2fxziuIyaa	yes its your uterus stretching. i got it and infact sometimes still do get a horrible weird stitch like feeling and 29wks!|`|tecPZUq2aa	Its Your Ligaments Stretching.

A baby.  Your cervix is going to thin, then dilate, and then sooner or later you will go into labor.  Congrats.
d5e3g4LEaa	Hi there, I do not know how far along you are, nor your age, but I believe your doctor(s) are correct.  I am only 14.5 weeks, and have experienced pressure as well, my midwife said it is normal and the older you are when pregnant, the more likely it is to feel this pressure.      Best wishes for your pregnancy!  Take Care, Vicki V  I hope his is following excerpt will help, it has been copied from the this website:  http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/p... :    Pelvic Pressure & Pain During Pregnancy    Pregnancy can be a time of extreme discomfort. From aching feet to lower back pain, the pregnant womans body feels the effects of being pregnant. In addition to carrying the weight of baby, the changing hormone levels and changing shape and size of the uterus cause all sorts of stresses on the body. One of the most common types of discomfort that a pregnant woman can experience is pelvic pressure and pain.    There are two major causes of pelvic pain & pressure during pregnancy. The expanding uterus presses on your pelvis, causing pain and pressure. As pregnancy moves on, your baby will become larger and move deeper and deeper into your pelvic area. At times, this can almost feel like someone is pushing from the inside on your pelvis. You may be actually able to feel your uterus at this time.    The second major cause of pelvic pain & pressure during pregnancy is the stretching of ligaments. As the ligaments that support your uterus thin and stretch, they can cause sharp, almost stabbing pains on the side of your pelvis. This pain can stretch all the way down to the thighs. The sciatic nerve may also be crowded, causing a painful or sometimes a numb feeling in this area as well.    There are a variety of things that you can do to help relieve pelvic pressure & pain during pregnancy. You might find that you can use heat, such as with a heat pack or a warm bath, to help relax your pelvic area. Some women have had success with pelvic massage. Sometimes, just changing your position can get your baby into a different spot, and thereby putting less pressure on your pelvis. Knee lifts can sometimes help with stretching ligaments, although you should always take care to do these in such a way that you maintain your balance and avoid the risk of falling. Pelvic rocking or hip squeeze exercises may provide some relief. If the pain and pressure are unbearable, or if they are frequent, you should speak with your health care provider.    Posted in Pregnancy|`|ke2SGcZDaa	I actually experienced a little bit of this last night. I tried an ice pack and then when that didn't work I tried a warm bath. I am 40 weeks pregnant and dilated to 5 and it feels like the baby's trying to come out. I felt like crying but the warm bath helps. After I had put my feet up and drank some water, I felt a bit better. Just pee when you feel the need. I know it's tiring and like every hour, but that gets rid of some of that pressure.|`|0AsML2Wnaa	Well, it all depends on how many months pregnant you are. The pressure might just be nothing, but i think that you should still go to your doctor and have them check you out, especially if the pain is getting worse, and your really uncomfortable.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	ohhhh the pressure is so normal! i have it all the time now. it hurts so much i can't move. the doctors say its because the baby dropped (but i'm also having twins so they both dropped!). hang in there. and lay down and put your feet up. it helps.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Yes actually that's all normal. I experienced it with my first pregnancy and now this one. The sharp pain is the baby pressing down, but don't worry, baby won't come out until he or she is ready =) The pressure and need to pee is something that is uncomfortable and sometimes annoying to me but that's part of the miracle of making a baby. Good luck.|`|RUfBeZNiaa	Don't worry...Its common to feel that kind of pressure when pregnant.  :)|`|wjlVMp1Zaa	Yea surprisingly doctors are right about this. Its because you still technically have your period while your pregnant but all you get is the cramps that come with it. Which for some ungodly reason seems to be like ten times worse. So it really is nothing to worry about just your normal cycle without all the blood and discharge stuff, nothing to worry about try drinking water and taking it easy that always helps me.
kcGFK36Waa	There okay during the day but at night they leak. My baby cousin had major leaks with them at night Luvs worked better for him.|`|AA10624857	There are many types and brands of diapers because not every baby is built the same way.  My oldest daughter has been using Target brand diapers for my 21 month old grandson since he was about 3 months old.  She really likes them and there isn't any leaking problems for her.  I am mom to 4 kids who are now 29, 27, 24, and 11.  My older 3 were babies back in the days when disposables were very expensive.  I was a stay-at-home mom and used cloth diapers.  When our little surprise baby came along, I thought I'd use cloth again, but disposables were not out of the question.  I ended up using them more than I thought and I actually loved the Luvs brand while many people I talked to didn't care for them.  For my daughter, they worked really well, though, and were cheaper.  I have been a licensed child care provider in my home for 21 years.  I have seen all brands and types of diapers on the market.  Everyone seems to have their favorites.  Each does have unique features that might work well for one baby, but not for another.  One of my daycare families used the SAM's Club brand (Member's Mark, I think), which worked well for their daughter.  However, I ran out of diapers for one of my other children once and borrowed one of their's for him.  Within a 1/2 hour he had leaked through it.  I think a lot has to do with the build of the baby.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I bought them because in general, I've been happy with other Target brand products.  But they totally sucked and I would never buy them again.  Stiff, leaky and the tabs were hard to attach.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	no   diapers are diapers i never had ne problems with diapers love them all|`|230NbPVUaa	when they are that little always use pampers or huggies (Hint: use coupons, you can find them online).. otherwise they will leak...(luvs in particular) But When they get older  like pull up sizes... target brand are the best.. they don't leak nearly as often as pull ups... which was suprising.. plus they save lots of money
dAgtW3G0aa	Connor is a great name, my second son is Conor, I always thought it was spelt with one n but I fully accept the double n spelling but hate the er spelling as that to me is the surname version I've even had someone spell my sons name Connagh which just looks odd to me! I like what you said about Rachel, we used it as a middle name for our daughter Nichol and she's constantly having to correct people not only for the extra A they add to Rachel but also the fact they add an E to Nichol (Nichol is greek Nichole is more french I think and they're pronounced differently) I always vowed after naming her that I'd be more careful about the spellings of names  because of the annoyance it causes her, even her grandma calls her nicole/nichole!      Ariel  is a great name that I've always loved but in england its the name of a soap powder so I've never been brave enough to use it!|`|OnDIrxNEaa	I think your choices are beautiful.  Ariel's a favorite of mine.  Very nice!|`|cHiv6eTWaa	I think the boys name is awesome sounds good together the girls name is just ok if I'm being honest. No real reason just have heard names I like better, personal preference.|`|o9tRjCMhaa	I love the name Ariel Elizabeth its sweet!!    Connor Loring is unique!|`|reQPwY6Saa	no. teasing is nooo fun for kids. i was teased for my name and from 1-12th grade, i would sit in fear of roll call because when the teacher called my name, i would hear snickers from the other kids with NORMAL names. it just makes kids feel like crap to be different from other kids.|`|MhZvYb8Baa	i think ariel elizabeth is suck a beautiful name. The disney princess wont be as big when she is in school. I like Connor also, even with the family tradition name. But have you thought about sspelling it Kohner or Kohnor? Just something to think about. Hope i was of some help.|`|VB1lUp5Maa	Personally, I'd spell it Ariele or Arielle...put a little original spin on it.  Conner is very cute, I like it but I tend to lean toward more originality so I would go with Carsten or Camden if it were me.  Good luck!!|`|wf53TiSpaa	I like connor but not ariel ariel just doesn't sound pretty.|`|GWZJkvMqaa	I knew a girl in high school named Ariel and I don't think there is anything wrong with it. Be aware that there are many people on here that are well under 18 answering these questions. Might not be the best place to get opinions. Congrats with your pregnancy.|`|VHHis05Naa	Not a huge fan of either name, but Ariel Elizabeth is a good enough name.|`|R8yKGv18aa	I like Connor, very Irish. I don't like the girl's name, too common.|`|j7wESGaDaa	I like them =]  Ariel is better than having such a common name like Jessica or Ashley (i hate when people give their kids name like that).    i think ur daughter, or son, would love their name =]|`|8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	Hey, I like both of them.  Good choices!  Congrats|`|UzkHnXzVaa	I really like Ariel Elizabeth. Connor is nice too. :)  As for the whole Disney Princess thing, so what? I don't believe she will get picked on... Maybe the kid named Apple or something, but not Ariel.   Kids are named Jasmine, (My little cousin=]) Belle, etc. and all those kids are fine, so why shouldn't she be named Ariel? I think it's a lovely name.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I love Connor!    My first thought when I saw Ariel was the soap powder. Don't know if that's a bad thing or a good thing?|`|cpM8GQ5Yaa	Like them.  Go4it.    d|`|IvkNTqDMaa	I really like them both :)|`|vOYyFqxRaa	I like them both but I hope you are pronouncing Ariel like Air real not   Are real. I hate it when kids have weird pronunciations. I love Connor too.|`|Wnmg850Paa	I don't think you need to worry about the Disney connection. I have heard many little girls called, Ariel, Aurora, Jasmine , Na la and even a Jasmine. I think they are worse things in this world to be named after.|`|0cc349e5b23bb03a0dcb7d4307ba36b0aa	All the names may be very charming when they are little tots in pre-school., but think about when they get to ninety.   At ninety they'll probably hate you for naming them Connor or Ariel.
6edczUEBaa	I just miscarried 2 months ago at 5 weeks and I had to have me hormone levels tested until they dropped all the way down to 5. My levels were low to begin with thats how I knew I had a miscarriage because I had no pain or anything just light spotting. My levels were only at 500 when they should have been in the thousands. It took 2 weeks after I miscarried for my levels to get down to 5. So right now if you did take a pregnancy test even if you did miscarry your test would still come out positive until your levels have dropped to about 5-10 this is what my OBGYN told me. But just because you your pregnancy symptoms went away does not at all mean you miscarried. Some women have symptoms the entire time and some do not it just depends on your body. The best way to see if you miscarried is to have an ultrasound done. That is the only way you are going to be able to tell at this point if you did miscarry. Hope all works out and I am sure you and your baby are fine. But you can't stress that just makes it hard on you and very hard on your baby.|`|87f8699fae346ba5d63a2c44b54e0151aa	Your body will continue to produce hCG until the placenta is expelled.
3EhoJ42zaa	It doesnt mean a single thing.  Some babies are engaged weeks, even months before delivery and some engage right before delivery.  It doesn't mean anything and is no indication when labor will be happening.  Don't get too discouraged.  Your baby might engage within the next 15 minutes, next few hours, few days.|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	this is wat they told my friend sam with her first and she just had it at the beginning of january and sh had it with no problems or complications|`|u12eVaDhaa	As long as the baby is head downwards it doesn't matter if it is not 'engaged' which means dropped down onto the cervix.  The baby's head can literally engage while you are in labour and there is no issue at all so don't worry.

You should really go on the pill, the pill with condoms is very effective.   If you are this stressed out about getting pregnant, maybe you should hold off on having sex a little longer.|`|HQneNb6Baa	99 % it was "yours"     but  is not true that condoms always works    world heath organizacion studies say tht (also for AIDS) there is a 10 % of  possibility of faults....

Also there is a cream that a guy just puts on his wrist and that works as well.

If it felt like really wet and stuff coming out well then there is a possibility it did break, maybe just wait until your period is due if it is not wait a week or a few days and do a test...

be5IoBEmaa	A family name is always tricky.  We used them for both of our children, but then, they were flexible, adaptable choices that made the grandparents VERY happy.    I think you're right to want to remember your father - I lost my dad at 15, too, so I know how important it can be to keep family names alive.  But remember ALL of your options:    1.  Using Siegfried as a middle name;  2.  Using your dad's middle name, his mother's name or his mother's maiden name;  3.  Using a name with the same meaning that wears more easily in English.  (Siegfried translates roughly to bringer of peace or victor who brings peace; that opens up Victor, Pax and a bunch of other ideas.)  4.  Using a nickname - or a name based on a nickname.  One of my daughter's middle names is Wren, after my sister's childhood nickname, Bird.    As for your kid having a tough time in school?  Don't sweat it.  For every kid who hates his "weird" name, another hates his "normal" name.  And these days, definitions of normal and weird are pretty fluid.      A name with meaning trumps one designed to simply not offend.    As for Skyler, though, I think Skyler might actually disappoint you.  If you're willing to use something so rich with meaning and personal history, why Skyler?  It blends in with all the Ky/Kay names for girls - Kylie, Kayla, Kaylin.  Some have legitimate roots - Skyler certainly does - but I wonder if you shouldn't dig a little deeper for something meaningful for *you* or your partner.    Edited to add:  If Siegfried feels like the right choice to you, then it is.  We considered Ignatius if  2 had been a boy and would've called him Iggy - so Ziggy sounds just fine to me.  And Sigg, while a water bottle company, has a nice outdoorsy, Scandinavian vibe, too.|`|j7wESGaDaa	I like Skyler Hope, and if ur worried about ur son being made fun of for Siegfried then that could be his middle name instead (Michael Siegfried sounds cute too). And u could still call him Siggi (which is the cutest nickname I ever heard), or even Ziggy (I like that one better).    EDIT: no, he wouldn't be made fun of in school for 'Ziggy'. if there was a kid in my school with that nickname, i'd be friends with him. it's a cool name. and plus if he doesn't wanna be called that, his friends don't have to call him that (and he doesn't have to tell him to). trust me, it's cute =]|`|4k5NJN29aa	Is there any way you can consider switching the names so that it's Michael Siegfried? That way, by the time kids will even start asking each other middle names, your son will know the importance, be able to explain it, and no one will bother him about it.|`|cEXzXkqnaa	Why not call him Michael Siegfried...then you can pay respects to your dad...and he won't be teased|`|i0B5Q2SKaa	its nice you were going to name the dad after your dad but not the best name no afance to your dad what about alea or it can be spelled alia and if a boy seth or bryce|`|JyghcEWpaa	i think that they are both great choices.  I love when parents have meaning and purpose behind their children's names|`|IvkNTqDMaa	I think you wanting to honor your father is sweet...however, you may want to consider making Siegfried the middle name...maybe Michael Siegfried instead? I think it's a bit harsh as a first name.  I think Skyler Hope is beautiful ;)    (edit) oh, I agree with you about Michael. I think it may be possible for him to be teased about Ziggy because of the cartoon named Ziggy(the short, fat, bald guy).|`|AA11210405	If it means so much to you then go for it. It's your child and you have the right to name it whatever you want..... if anyone questions it you just say it's a family name and leave it at that....  As a mother of 4 I can tell you that they are correct that with a name like Siegfried he will probably get tortured at school. You could name him it and only refer to him witha nickname at school and ask that the teacher use his knickname.... or you might want to consider using his middle name of Michael as his everyday name.   Michael is a beautiful name.   then you can honor your father but be true to your son.   - from a mom of 4!|`|z5ivAuv0aa	Make it his middle name.|`|joPJtKemaa	Michael might be boring but your child will not be harassed in school.    Think of your child when naming him/her. Would you want to be called Siegfried, No offense but kids can be very very cruel!!!!!!!!|`|9a2MdcuSaa	nice

Let him leave you.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Why would you want to stay with a guy that doesn't love you? A baby won't stop a guy. And if it did once he found out you weren't pregnant he would leave you for lying in the first place. So what's the use? You are making yourself look really stupid! Grow up and move on.|`|zLVZyfwUaa	You need to grow up.  So lying to him is going to make your relationship soooo much better and then when you "lose" the baby it will bring you so much closer?  Either get some counseling to see you are worth more or do the guy a favour and let him leave.|`|NQQaoG8Oaa	and you wonder why he doesn`t want to be with you if this is the sad immature kind of things you do|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	If he doesn't want to be with you now, he won't want to be with you just bc you are pregnant. You are 15!! I GUARANTEE you, this is not going to be the guy you are with the rest of your life. You will have many boyfriends in your lifetime. You don't want to be with someone that would only stay with you bc he thinks you are pregnant. Even if it worked and he stayed your boyfriend...what would you tell him in 9 months when no baby came out? Then he would just be pissed again and leave you anyway. Find a new boyfriend!!|`|MqFeJiukaa	You can't fake a baby bump.  If he dont want to be with you a baby wont change that.  Besides he is going to find out eventually and then never speak to you again like when he wants to have sex and you have a pillow in your tummy?!  You really need to focus on school and getting some self esteem to land a guy that cares about you and wants to be with you.  You can't trap people like that.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	This is not a good idea hun. I'm not trying to be mean, but you're only 15 and you have your whole life ahead of you. Just because things aren't working out with you and him doesn't mean you won't find love again. I know the last thing you want to hear right now is that there's plenty of guys out there, but there are. Lying to him and trying to trap him into staying with you will never work. He'll resent you for lying to him and probably think its immature. Just let him go. It's for the best. It'll be hard but trust me you will get over it and find someone better. Best of luck to you.|`|7jdvcrTKaa	I understand that u do love this boy but remember there are plenty of fish in the sea and u don't need to waste ur time on this one if he wants to leave. Even if u do fake a baby bump that doesn't mean that he will stay. Most guys his age will actually run away harder and then claim that the "baby" is not his and that u are a whore. Therefore the best thing for u to do is just let him go, grieve, and move on|`|zsrnhstUaa	thats sad.If he dont want you then leave him alone.When i was 16 my bf of 4 years left me and i wouldent let him go.I bugged him all the time.He ended up beating my *** up.So leave him alone.Your to young to freak out about relationships|`|5iMja1Meaa	People have said it all...    faking a pregnancy is ridiculous, sorry.    :)|`|psnaJcvpaa	I don't wanna say anything that's already been said by everyone on this board...However,  I would like to comment on what you said about getting pregnant for real...    To get yourself pregnant in reality will be a big mistake,you are being rather spiteful and to use a baby as a weapon just so that you can keep your boyfriend is disgusting. A baby is a human being,not an object. There are a lot of harsh words expressed by people on this board,but they are only trying to help you and make you see sense honey    You are only 15 and very immature. You should definatley not be ready for motherhood in any way shape or form,whether it's a real baby or a stuffed cushion.|`|zoyw8CRKaa	Sorry you are going to loose the one you love because he doesn't LOVE you anymore!!! you cannot make someone love you and you certainly cant blame anyone else on here for that! personally i think you should grow up ALOT!!! and i so sincerely hope you do not fall pregnant because i certainly wouldn't bring a child into the world if i was a lying conniving little girl like you sorry to be truthful but you are blaming everyone else for whats happening to you i lost the one i loved i was going to marry him for god sake and yes! it damb hurts but you get over it and move on, are you gonna be the ex who is possessive and wont leave him alone? after i split up with my ex i thought my life was over but 3 weeks after i picked myself up and got on the wagon again and 6 months later i met my man we got married and now having a baby. And i am only 20 so i don't think age has anything to do with it. Don't have a baby because you want something to love it is so for the wrong reasons. Carry on with school move on from this guy! find another one your young! don't have a baby btw! your underage to have sex! i don't even know why i am putting this here because your spiteful and will do exactly what you want regardless of other people.    JUST GROW UP SHOULD BE ALL I SHOULD HAVE PUT!!!!!!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Not only should you concentrate on your education....(spelling is atrocious. Mine was superb at 15...)  Never lie to a man to keep him!  And if he is leaving, let him. If he wants you, or you are easy enough, he will come back. I learned that the hard way when I was younger.  If he is your one true love, don't you think he will come back? Or that you will find your way back to one another?  You will be in love more than once in all probability.  Lose him? You never had him.   Sex is no way to keep a man. He can find that elsewhere.   And babies?  Those are not a glue or an instant fix. Those are a lifetime commitment!!!! You cannot shove them back inside when it does not work.  Most guys leave when the GIRL gets pregnant.   Yes, I was pregnant as a 15 year old. IT is not an easy thing or a game.   You do care. Or you would not ask a dumb question. You can look it up yourself!!!  No one on here caused you to lose your boyfriend..unless it is one of your friends who is sleeping with him who answered. You know someone else is.  You should be better than that. You are better than that.   No one knows what your life is like. Dishonesty bites you in the ***. Stop watching Days of Our Lives and look around you. You can go to school and learn to spell, be anything you want to be. Not a 'baby mama' that your 'boyfriend' talks about to his friends or new girl.   True love?  Wait until you know the meaning of it. Give it a few years. Maybe even more than that.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	It's not our fault if your boyfriend finishes you. I wish him luck, you sound loopy, maybe that's why! chill out a bit.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	That is sad.    Let him go and move on with your life.  You are 15.  There are other guys out there.|`|1audzkx6aa	You need to grow up girl, pretending to be pregnant so he stays with you is not the smartest thing to do. And you are only 15, what are the chances that he is your true love?|`|7U9UAtTSaa	Grow up you stupid child|`|fJaZlJQXaa	Are you being serious??? How absolutely pathetic if you are.|`|xSfgrdFJaa	seriously grow up honey im not surprised he said he is leaving you if this is your way of dealing with it. and by the way bumps dont show til about 3 to 4 months.|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	U need to get over it...seriously. If he doesn't want you then he don't and you shouldn't want him after that. You're too young to even know about trying trap somebody. I suggest you pay more attention to you and stop worrying about what he's doing...he's just not that into you.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	and what are you going to do when your in apparent labour?? pop a pillow out?? pretend miscarraige? thats sick cos it happens in reality!!!! move on accept he no longer loves you and wants you.....theres someone out there that will.|`|bTlhBX3daa	If you could lie about something like being pregnant, you are not a very nice person, and I can see why your boyfriend fell out of love with you.     Why would you even want him to stay when he said he doesn't love you?   And what do you plan to do when it becomes obvious that you AREN'T pregnant?   Or do you intend to FAKE a miscarriage too?     Despicable and selfish.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	thats just plain stupid, its not like hes likely to stay with you even if he had a baby, get over him|`|MsipL0Mzaa	why would you?...thats insane...|`|qi6mAsCZaa	That is sooo wrong...Why do you want to stay with someone who doesn't want to stay with you. Telling him your pregnant is not going to keep him around, it's just a lie. It doesn't guarantee that he will stay with you. If he decides he wants to help you, he can do it at a distance you know? What makes you think you can ruin someone else's life by being so selfish. You apparently are not going to get a good man this way...Get a life!!!|`|5R36IyUcaa	youre only 15 worry about school not pregnancy or a guy ... it wont last no way....|`|dR2bqUixaa	Why would you do that to someone? That is very stupid. If you end up telling him that he is going to find out as soon as you go to the doctor or don't start showing. There is no way to fake it unless you decide to get fat. But if you do that then when he finds out your not pregnant and leaves you anyway, then you are just going to be a fat girl that probably won't be able to get anyone else. (I'm not saying that "fat" girls can't get anyone, I'm just trying to put common since into this girl).|`|daJk1VePaa	what they said ^^|`|SUR1MHqWaa	You are 15 you shouldn't be having sex - get a life and go and live it to the full before you even consider having children !|`|053a4548821e29d68d196b76d3989f07aa	Tell me something...      Did you REALLY get on here actually thinking that someone would give you SOME kind of advice that you might find realistic and useful?    This is a job for sleazy underhanded friends or whoever else is low enough to give you real advice to such a question.    Like another user answered: What do you think is going to happen when he finds out the truth? Obviously he will. Even if you find some ridiculous way to make yourself REALISTICALLY show, then what about doctors appointments/papers? What if he wants to go? Or see a real pregnancy test? What if he tells his parents and they get involved? What if they call YOUR parents?    Is it really worth it? Oh, and that's just the beginning. What are you going to tell your friends? Going to lie to them to? Or are you going to tell them and take a chance of someone spilling the truth?    There's just way too much thought, drama, and deceit that would go into this. Are you sure you're that much of a drama queen, and is he REALLY worth all that? (and probably more trouble than I could even think of off the top of my head.)    Wake up. Where are your priorities? This boy? Or your grades?     What is WRONG with today's kids?!    ======    **EDIT: As per your additional details.... Seriously now. At the very least.. why would you LIE to someone you claim to love? If you love someone you don't trick them, fool them, or do anything of the sort. You definantely don't sit there and tell them something that could RUIN his life or get kill in SERIOUS trouble with his parents. Why in the world would you want to go through the trouble of telling such a HUGE and HORRIBLE lie? And are you naive enough to think he would never find out? Apparently you don't care about having a reputation. Once you try and pull off this lie and he does break up with you, then what guy at your school will want to date a liar who sleeps around and pretends to be pregnant?    ==============    **Another EDIT: What are Fanks?? Honey, if you can't spell, what makes you think you can pull this off? OH and now its everyone on here to blame for YOU losing your boyfriend? It seems to me you were already driving him away anyhow. I mean really. 1 out of 60+ people gave you a somewhat answer that you might have been looking for. What does that say to you? OH, and last but certainly not least - Lets PRETEND you get pregnant by someone that's NOT your boyfriend. HAH! How do you think THAT will play out?? Then you're just gonna be seen as a slu-t in his eyes. Good luck!!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	It is very, very wrong for you to try to keep your boyfriend by faking being pregnant.  It is dishonest and will not change his feelings for you, at least not for the better.  It doesn't matter what your life is like, it is wrong under any circumstance to fake being pregnant to trap someone into staying with you when they don't want to.  If he was to believe you, he would be staying with you for all the wrong reasons.  And what happens when you don't have a baby?  He will dislike you more than ever when he finds out you're a liar.|`|F12ekJ7Saa	Have you considered counseling? And no i don't mean for your boyfriend... I mean for yourself :)|`|9zMC6EBtaa	I have some bad news to tell you, I don't think you getting pregnant at 15 is going to make your boyfriend stay. On the contrary it will probably make him run so fast the other way, you won't know what happened. I know you may really love him and may not want him to leave, but you can not make someone stay with you. If it's meant to be, than he will come back to you. If not, you will find someone even better. Please think about what you are doing before you do anything stupid to change the rest of your life. Hope that helped.|`|5UcdeeX8aa	Slim girls, 1st time moms wouldn't show until the 6th or 7th month. He will know you are lying. Don't be stupid, and girl you do not want to be pregnant. Trust me these hemmorhoids and this heartburn aint no joke. Quit having sex before you get yourself into something you're not ready for.|`|lJd5OET6aa	if the only way a guy will stay with u is if ur pregnant then he probably will onyl be interested in the baby and not YOU dont u think? and i guess you would fake "miscarry" (which is NOTHING 2 play around with because in real life it is VERY heartbreaking)... but then he would just leave u all over again. I kinda know how u feel though when i was ur age i lied 2 my boyfriend and told him i was pregnant just to get that extra attention and it did NOTHIN we still ended up breakin up and i just felt plain dumb. Now im 17 and I really am pregnant and trust me its not all fun and games, my babys daddy is locked up 4 god knows how long, im left all by myself, my mom kicked me out the house, real life starts 2 kick in and it can get depressing and lonely. A baby is no joke...grow up a little bit kid...|`|D38l37biaa	sweetie, this really isn't the answer. I thought things like this  when i was fifteen as well and u will learn that you are worth more than this. If he doesn't love you, then he doesn't deserve to be with you. If you want to give him a reason to stay ask him what would make things better, do stuff together, go out and have fun and he might see he really does want to be with you. If you got pregnant, it wouldnt necessarily mean he would want to be with you, only that he might have to-and that isnt good either. You need someone who wants to be with you for exactly who you are! You don't need a baby right now, your life should be about you! You are the most important thing, not your boyfriend. If you don't stay together, things will be hard for a while but im sure, when the time is right, you will meet someone who is really worth having a baby with. xxxx|`|AA11348933	Get over it.  He doesn't love you.  Trying to trap him with a fake pregnancy proves that you don't really love or respect him either.  It hurts to break up with someone.

Your boyfriend will find out eventually, and what will you do when you're meant to be giving birth 8 months later? Or were you planning on an eternal pregnancy? What if you tell him your pregnant, and he still leaves you? It's not the way to keep someone. It's entrapment, its selfish, and it's unfair. Be woman enough and let him go if he wants to. You'll meet someone else, and this will embarrass you when you look back. Good luck my dear.|`|Gd9jdlrNaa	If he really loves you he will stay with you weather you are pregnant or not.  But if he doesn't love you and says he is going to leave you believe me he will leave weather he thinks you are pregnant or not.  You don't want to be a single teenage mother chasing after a guy that you love but don't love you back.  Your only 15 enjoy being single and having fun going out with your friends not at home taking care of a baby dreaming your boyfriend is going to come running back to you.|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	Why do you want to be with someone who doesn't love you?  You're only 15, there are going to be plenty of boys, if this guy doesn't want to be with you, let him go and find someone who does and is going to love you without having to "trap" him into a relationship.  Just because your "pregnant" doesn't mean he is going to want to stay with you.  It might actually send him packing faster.|`|SxYhRY7Xaa	wow you sure are getting a lot of answers from this mindless questions. honestly, honey i was in your shoes once. i never actually went through with it, but i did want to become pregnant at 16 when my boyfriend (who i thought at the time was my one and only) was planning on leaving me. Now I can't say that I know what you're going through, nor can anyone else. We all live our lives in many different ways, but YOU did come here for OUR help. So maybe you should listen to some of these people (not the insensitive ones.. but the ones who know better)    Talk to him. If you really love him, there are more important things to worry about right now than to worry about faking a pregnancy. And if you might have already talked to him and he just wants to be free... let him go. The best things in life (that are worth it) always come back, and when the time is right.. he will return if it's meant to be.    I dated this guy in 7th grade.. LONG TIME AGO.. and now we've been together for over 2 years and we're grown and ready to prepare a very nice wedding soon. But there are times when I thought he was just a friend and not worth it. I treated him like ****. But he stuck around for a long time... and he never gave up on me. He dated other people as did I and he was always there after every guy broke my heart (even after the one who I wanted to get pregnant by) and he always gave me hope!    Honestly, you are probably a wonderful beautiful young girl.. who has plenty of time to prepare for a lifetime of true love and babies. This is probably going to be a very hard time if he does leave you. But if he does, he's missing out. You Aren't!!!    But as I stated before, you came for our advice on how to fake a baby bump. My answer.. you really can't. There's really no way to fake it, especially when you two have had sex before, if he thinks you are pregnant and you do have sex again soon.. what are you going to do when he wants an explaination for why you have a "baby bump" with a shirt on and without a shirt you don't.     You have a life ahead of you.. choose wisely.. either way you choose.. may it be the path you are destined for!!!|`|cc900592d75c8b50ff8d51b6007cec41aa	Give me strength !!!!!|`|claUGpVRaa	You're only 15 for goodness sake!You are still a child yourself and it is illegal for you to have sex anyway. How can you think you have found the man of your dreams at 15 years old? That's ridiculous. So now you are going to get yourself pregnant deliberately and bring another unwanted child in to the world when you are clearly too immature to care for it. Then you will expect all us tax payers to pay to raise your child and all because you have been dumped at 15. You are pathetic and need a change of attitude very quickly. You are a child. If you want to be treated as a grown up, act like one, and stop reacting to people's answers the way you have - defensively when you asked such a stupid question in the first place.|`|giEXhSTIaa	Please don't do this hun. He will find out and this will make things worse. Lying has the tendency to backfire, trust me. Relationships are based on trust. The only way to deal with this is to talk to him. Tell him how you feel, that you don't want him to leave. Talk it out.   But you don't need to go to these lengths to keep a guy. I know that it's upsetting being in this situation, I've been there. I'd give anything for them not to leave. But lying isn't worth it. Please try and find some happiness in yourself. I bet your a wonderful person. Have some good clean fun.

Your only 15 you don't want to waste time with someone like that anyway|`|Mn1KPh9yaa	One i wouldnt do that considering the fact that when he finds out that you not pregnant he is going to hate you even more and than for sure never love you again..    this is the stupidest thing that you could ever do.  you reallyy need to grow up.|`|O3gBVYb9aa	if he says he doesn't love anymore then chances are he never really did and faking being pregnant isn't something to joke about your young and you'll find another boyfriend but you shouldnt worry about being with someone just have some fun because in the end guys just and up causing trouble and its not worth it at that age trust me have some fun and let him go you'll find someone who really does care sooner or later and hes not worth stressing over|`|UQlOw4hBaa	that's a mean, nasty, evil, manipulative thing to do, and if you're even considering doing it you really are too immature to be in a relationship.    say you DO manage to find a way, and he believes you, and stays with you... how are you going to fake doctor's appointments, scans, test results?    how are you going to fake childbirth and how will you explain that there's no baby at the end of it?    he doesn't want to be with you - tough! if you really care about him, you'll let him be free to find someone HE does want to be with. and even though it feels like the end of the world now, you'll get over him, in time, and find someone else... and eventually you'll find someone you REALLY want to spend your life with, and who feels the same about you - and you'll settle down, have real babies and look back on what you're considering now and be very, very glad you didn't...|`|AA12146210	heya    im not sure if fking a baby bump is gonna be the way but ypu asked a question so ill give the answer a go...    try wearing extra clothing  use a small cushion..  eat more to gain the weight( try)    that all i can say cause never had to give that sort of advice ...sorry huni|`|ebYJdyjJaa	Well sweetie if he says he don't love you any more then you don't need him and faking being prego is not going to make him love you anyways. Your 15 years old and theres plenty of guys out there.   A baby or faking being prego is not the way to keep any guy around and also what are you going to do if 9 months from now theres no baby? How are you going to explain that to him?   So my best advise to you is no matter how bad it hurts let him go and im sure someone better will come along.|`|4KgJgadvaa	Oh my god i cant belive u have asked that. If u love him that much then u would not lie to him.  He would hate you for it. There are people out there that cant have kids and theres u saying your going to get pregnant just to keep your boyfriend. You really need to grow up and sort your self.|`|tNh5ZoZSaa	think you all need to lay off the girl for a start its comments like these that lead to people being insecure n the first place. You lot need to grow up    even though you think this is the only way to keep them it really is n ot hunny...your only 15 with a great life ahead of you. if he leaves well his loss! go enjoy your life with your friends all these men worries will come in time when your older! believe me! faking a pregnancy will do nothing and think how silly it would feel if he found out! go have fun.....and dump him first :)|`|WlU3NFu6aa	uhmm totally not a good idea. I thnk after like 9 mo and theres no baby he will figure it out and then dump your *** for being stupid and lying to him|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	if a boy is determined to leave you, nothing is going to stop him. including faking you are pregnant. sorry! but a boy (and i mean boy,not man) who isnt committed to you before you were "pregnant" isnt going to stick around because of it. and you are 15!!! stop having sex! your not old enough to support a child! im sure you really care about this boy but remember you have your whole life to find someone who will love you back-unconditionally!|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	He will run a mile!

And you really need to GROW up before even considering bringing a child into this world.  There are people put there who would love to have kids and cant and women who miscarry time and time again, and your going on like that.  Go and buy yourself a Baby Annabell doll these are just like real baby's they cry and everything because to be honest your very immature and you could not cope with having a child.  Really you cannot bring a child into the world to try to keep a "boyfriend" and you are only 15, still at school and not grown up enough to have a child and have all that responsibility.|`|p0prrzf2aa	how stupid are you.      you can't make anyone stay with you, especially like that. and when he finds out your really not pregnant he WILL leave for GOOD      and don't get pregnant just to keep your boyfriend, thats so stupid. baby's are made so you can love them, not used just so your boyfriend won't leave. your pathetic|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	grow up!!! that is so wrong!    dear....you have no idea what my life is like either. however, faking a pregnancy or saying your going to go get pregnant just to stay with someone is not the answer. if you were pregnant at 15, i guarantee you that your life would get much much much worse. trust me, being pregnant at almost 21 years old is not a walk in the park. and i'm single. if the guy doesn't want to be with you, then he's not the one...he's not worth it. there are so many other fish out there in the sea. you have all the time in the world. you'll find someone. trust me.|`|U4JEgNPNaa	ARE YOU SERIOUS?????    What the heck is wrong with you?????    Okay, then in 9 months how will you explain that you dont have a baby?    Honestly, let this guy go. He's not wanting to be with you now, and he WONT want to be with you pregnant, pretending or not. Faking being pregnant is just  seriously disturbing.|`|AA10186411	You are an ignorant little kid.

If This Is What Your Relationship Is Coming To, Well Im Sorry But Its Cr_aP.  You Don't Want To Be Pregnant At 15 Anyway.  Just Leave It And Call It A Day.  But Im Not Going To Change Your Mind So I Think The Best Way Is To Shove A Pillow Up Yah Top.  But You Are Going To Get Found Out Sooner Or Later And When You Do Its Not Going To Be Pretty.  Good Luck X|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Honestly, the people on here might sound harsh, but don't even entertain the notion. Faking it is dumb; doing it for real is even dumber. You are 15 years old - if your boyfriend doesn't love you, maybe it's because you're both too young to know what love really is. Wait another ten years to get pregnant ... don't saddle a guy or yourself with a baby you can't even take care of just because you want to force him to stay around. Think about that unborn child and what you would be doing to it. .. who's going to take care of it? How would you finish your education? And why would ANYONE want to stay with a girl who is so immature and devious as  to trap someone?     You're right, we don't know what your life is like. But if you do this, I can assure you - from my own experience of being a mother to soon-to-be THREE KIDS - that your life is not going to get better by having a baby, especially this way.     With this kind of attitude, you are WAY too young to have a child. Especially one that's bound to either be raised by your parents or the taxpayers. Move on - it's not the end of the world.    ETA: All the experience of women on here who have been pregnant and know what it's like, and yet you STILL think you know it all... how depressing and sad. Imagine, if someone tried to trick you this way? Wouldn't you be upset? Say someone tried to trick you into thinking something that could alter your life forever - like if your prince of a boyfriend lied and told you you had AIDS - what would you do? You'd be pretty pissed, right?     Now grow up. Try and get through your head that you have no idea what you're doing and think you have all the answers, which you don't. Accept it and move on with your life already instead of dwelling on this poor boy - at your age people change their minds about gf's and bf's like they change underwear. It's normal, accept it.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Okay, lets presume this question is genuine and you're not a troll;    Do you honestly think that a teenage boy is going to hear that his girlfriend is pregnant and want to stay with her? Seriously poppet, he's going to run a mile if you tell him you're pregnant. If he does stay how are you going to explain it when you don't have a baby in 9 months? You can hardly fake a miscarriage, that would be a very cruel thing to do and could cause him serious hurt...besides, lets say your idea does work and he does stay with you and you tell him you miscarried, are you going to keep that lie up all your lives?    I really feel sorry for you that you are this desperate to hang onto this boy, he must seem really special to you? :o(    Ask him why he doesn't love you and see if it's something you can work on together, if not you will have to move on. You're so young there will be loads more boys/men out there for you...I remember how sad it is when that first special relationship breaks up but I'm happily married now, I moved on fairly quickly even though I thought I never would! And you will too! :o)    As for getting pregnant for real, you REALLY don't want to do that! Have you seen what babies do to your body? Hehe, you don't want saggy t*ts and stretch marks before you're even 20! And on a more serious note babies put a huge strain on relationships, they don't bring you closer together...even the strongest of relationships are tested under the pressure of pregnancy and a new baby! Besides which, how will you pay for/look after a baby. I'm married and pregnant and terrified of how we'll cope for money even though both my husband and myself are in full-time work!     Please don't do this, it's not a good idea at all...either work it out like grown ups or leave him and move on.    If you do have to leave him surround yourself with friends and enjoy being young! xxx
LFXTpqfdaa	Pulling out was likely the oldest method of contraception. Acidic substances were placed in the vagina as marginally effective spermicides. Oiled paper or beeswax was used as a cervical cap. Condoms were made of animal intestine.    There were also several herbs that would cause a miscarriage, but most of them only worked by poisoning the woman to the point that her body would expel the baby. Back in those days, though, childbirth was very dangerous in itself, so the side effects of the poison may have seemed less dangerous in comparison.     As an aside, pregnancy could be detected by injecting a frog with a woman's urine. If the frog produced eggs, the woman was pregnant. Isn't that interesting?|`|87f8699fae346ba5d63a2c44b54e0151aa	They had lots more babies, and they didn't have as much premarital sex.    Also, exclusive breastfeeding tends to increase the spacing between children, as does the rhythm (calendar) method, though neither works great as "birth control" for everyone; it certainly helps.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Didn't have sex. I've heard vinegar worked sometimes too.|`|KXBGhPLhaa	long ago. condoms made from sheepskin or animal intestines  even in victorian times they had this tampon shaped device that contained whiskey and would be inserted after sex to kill sperm. pretty gross|`|GW91ZTZjaa	In victorian times the couple would of had sex and the woman would of had a VERY hot bath afterwards.
M5E3mDBJaa	Having worked in a daycare before, this is totally unacceptable behavior from the care workers.  They need to be able to see the children they are in charge of at all times and make accident/incident reports out for ANYTHING that could potentially (or does) leave a mark on a child.  By them saying "I don't know" that translates to "I wasn't paying attention" and that really bothers me.      I would pull her out of the daycare until further notice, take pictures of the injury and take her to the pediatrician to have them evaluated and documented (for legal purposes and protection).|`|AA12243380	Does she fight you at diaper changes?    One of my twins is 20 months (almost) and she fights me so hard... it's like wrestle mania.    All I can think of is that she was accidentally scratched perhaps?  Maybe the caregiver is afraid to say something... or maybe something more sinister happened.    I always keep my nails very short so I don't accidentally poke or scratch my kiddos.    Good luck!  I think I would just mention that your noticing a lot of marks on your daughter and you'd like the staff just to keep an eye on her.    Of course, my toddlers sometimes have scratches that I don't notice them getting.  One of my girls has a skinned knee and my husband asked me how she got it and I honestly have no clue.  They don't cry every time they fall so it's hard to know, know what I mean?|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	wow,this could be very serious.  forget all the sweet, care givers that will only hold you back you need to be very firm and direct let them no your seriously concern,just sit down and say i wanted to meet with you today to discus something that is bothering me greatly.good luck x|`|ZzDdG6yVaa	Take pictures... From what you describe, this is an extremely serious matter. I wouldnt speak to anyone but the person in charge, and I wouldnt give a damn about sounding accusing. Either her pants were off or someone grabbed her leg so hard that their nail dug into her skin. Dont let this go. The tone you used in this post, is exactly how I would approach it. Let them know you mean business. Besides that, I would probably take my child out of that center.|`|c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	Definitely bring it up to the principal...she/he won't think you are playing a blame game. Truth is, they want to know! It gives them a heads up to watch out for something. Just tell them as such..."I just want to touch base with you on some marks I have found on my daughter. She says it is her friend, but the thigh marks concern me. Could you please let me if there is a child that tends to mark other children that I should be aware of?"..and go from there. You are concerned...they will understand! Just check her body day in and day out! Also, daycare workers usually have to keep very short cut nails to prevent this...could is very well be another child? Did she have thin pants on or something?|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	Its hard for us to say with out seeing the marks. Ask someone else to look at them with out giving them any info and ask what they think it is aska  few people. just say can you look at this and tell me what you see. then when they tell you tell them what you see and talk about it. If more then one other person agress they are adult nail marks i would look in to changing daycare. Alot of people can seem sweet then hurt your child when they are stressed. They could have told your daughter not to say anything or they would hurt her again or she could just feel if she talks she willbe hurt. calmly ask her what happened. ask her with a smile did you fall down did you get scratched. If when you saw them and showed them to your hubby and were in a panic the child sensed it causeing her to fear .|`|pa8nZt9Eaa	if she says it was her friend you should go to the Principal say i have  been seeing scrathes evryday ask the prncipal to keep an eye out for the teachers and who ever her close friend is|`|pxkUYa3Yaa	My advice is to start looking for another daycare. You are her mother and if your heart and instincts are telling you that something isn't right, then you should listen. Even if you bring this up to the principal, what is to say that anything will be resolved? Hell, they don't even know what happened or who did it. I also feel sorry for you because you will have to spend everyday at work worrying about your daughter and if she is safe. My advice is simply to start looking for someone new before it is too late.     I had a similar situation. My oldest son (8 months at the time) I enrolled in a daycare and had marks and bruises on his body at least 1 time per week. I inquired with the daycare and what they told you was the exact same thing they told me. I just waited it out because I could not find anyone cheaper and decided to rectify it by having a conversation with the supervisor. Not even one month later, he developed a terrible rash. Every day I would pick him up and his diaper would be dry and clean with 0-1 diapers left in the diaper bag. I would do all I could with ointments, baths, powders, and even letting it air out every chance I had. For 2 months this rash never got better, instead it got worse. It even got to the point of bleeding. One day I popped in early (which is another idea that you could do without calling) and his diaper was soaked. It was only 2 hours earlier than when I usually come, and in the diaper bag only 1 diaper of the 6 had been used. I immediately took him out. About 3 years later, I put him back in to the daycare because I heard from a co-worker that her mother worked there and that they changed staff. Come to find out, my son was molested by a woman provider at that daycare a few weeks later. I pressed charges and called DFS. I don't know if this helped you much, but that is my advice and story.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	In some child care facilities the employees aren't allowed to tell you anything... it's actually in their contract. I hope you get the answers you are looking for but if something bad is going on I wouldn't expect a lot of honesty. If you are still wanting to keep her there, talk to the other moms have them check their children and make your case known to everyone there. That way they might keep a better eye on the kids.... if they can't explain why she's getting them, they may not be watching her as closely as they should.    Good luck, I hope you find out what's going on!

d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Cipro is a category C in pregnancy. Meaning that it is unknown if it causes harm to a fetus. Almost all prescription drugs are given this category. Only bc they haven't had enough studies on them for them to be able to say that they are 100% safe in pregnancy. (it covers them in case something were to happen) While there are not enough studies to show it is safe...There are also no studies showing that Cipro is unsafe to take while pregnant. As long as she took the medication as directed and only one time, I doubt there will be any problem. Here is a website on the safety of Cipro while pregnant.     http://www.otispregnancy.org/pdf/ciprofl...|`|p0prrzf2aa	probably not. the baby is very very very tiny at 3 weeks
NY2fpmvPaa	I think that it might vary from state to state as far as the guidelines for pregnant women. Someone else said in here that the medical care for adults with children and the medical care for pregnant women is different. Besides Alaska and Hawaii, I believe that your household income must be below approx. $23,000 (I don't know if that is before or after taxes though...)    If you can't afford insurance, then you definitely will not be able to afford to pay for the medical expenses of your pregnancy without being on medicaid. It's not low. You work. Your husband works. You pay taxes for this. You need it, so get on it!  Your state's health and welfare department (some states might call it something different) will have the necessary paperwork to fill out. You could check online to see if they have a printable form.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Well.... my personal belief is that if you are both working, but can't afford to get insurance, then how can you expect to afford all the things a baby needs once its born?  I wouldn't think that now would be the best time to have a child, but that's just me.  I'd say its smarter to prevent a pregnancy of a child that you are not capable of financially providing for rather than sitting around waiting to get on medicaid.  That being said, if you get pregnant and Medicaid is the only way you can get the prenatal care that you need.... then that's what its there for.  I don't consider anyone to be "low" for using assistance when they need it.  The question is, would you even qualify since you are both working full-time?|`|5UcdeeX8aa	Private healthcare for me was $104 + 27 for dental but when I got pregnant I lost my job, so I ended up needing medicaid and it's not low if you really do need it. You probably won't qualify for medicaid with 2 working people in the house. It is cheaper to just sign up with Aetna or Blue Cross on your own.  You won't qualify for maternal coverage for an entire year, so you need to think about that now before planning a family.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	If you qualify for Medicaid, go for it.  It's very important for pregnant women to have health insurance.  I had to quit my job when I was 8 weeks pregnant to be on bed rest and even still, I don't qualify for any assistance at all.  I am on my husband's insurance and it is very expensive, but we have no choice.|`|07d2086aa27d1ba3ef711ade9372b259aa	It's not low of you if it's your only option, but I do have to tell you that you may not qualify for it being married and living with the father. They will use his income against you when trying to qualify you. If he makes too much money you won't get free care. You may have to pay part of it. Good luck!|`|9zMC6EBtaa	I don't think it would be a a wrong thing to do if you chose to enroll in Medicaid, it is for people like you who really need it. Just be advised that depending on how much you and your husband make per month, you may not be able to receive Medicaid. There are earning limits but I am not sure of the amounts, so find those out beforehand. If you can not receive Medicaid, check with your states programs. Some states offer public health care for a lower cost or even free to low income families. Search for state funded health care and see what you come up with. As far as being embarrassed, I wouldn't be. No one even has to know if you don't want them to.|`|LABC73E7aa	no its not low. if your uncomfortable you can go to one of those free medical care pregnancy centers. or get cinergy health care for 150 a month. i think medicaid is the best option!|`|3c724f5ab73b7356d0f55d16d18e2019aa	So if u are pregnant u can get on medicaid. U can probably get it if u have kids. If u have rent and its more of ya income i think u can get some welfare help. Just explore the different programs and get brochures and pamphlets. Ask questions u think that can benefit u. cause if one of ya make to much money they will do the math so make sure u ask the right questions. It doesn't hurt to ask.|`|clipc9yJaa	They have to cover you if you are pregnent. All your need to do is bring in a dr note saying u are being cared for because you are pregnent. I jus took my Cousin because she isnt married to the baby's dad yet so she is not insured. They will take care fo everything for the baby. Best of luck|`|bsge5nZPaa	There is a difference between having money and getting on pregnancy medicaid, and housing and all of that, and not having money and getting on that!  You have to do what you have to do...don't let what other people think or say make the decision for you. Unless they want to pay everything!! ;)|`|AA10186411	Its not low at all.  You have a job, and you pay taxes.  Therefore, you aren't just leeching off of others.  I think its absolutely fine if you get on it.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with being on Medicaid.  You pay for it out of your taxes.  There's no reason why you shouldn't take advantage of it if you need to!  Heck, I WISH I could be on Medicaid so I wouldn't have to pay so much for insurance out of pocket.  You wouldn't be abusing the system - it's there for people who need it and that would be you!|`|6ZoiGLo5aa	naw it isnt low at all.  it actually helps you out more than u think.  just cause you get medicaid or welfare doesnt mean your poor at all.  its just a way of extra help.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Do what you have to in order to keep you and your baby healthy.

B0gBjCa3aa	It isn't about cm's...it is about membranes being intact ("water") and about how labor is progressing.  If your water hasn't broken and you are not in labor, trust me, you will go home.  You have no medical condition to keep you in the hospital.    I was 6 cm's for a month.  I had false labor once (at 10 days past due)and I was in the hospital...they sent me home when they were sure I wasn't in labor.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	my hospital will keep you if you are 5cm or above|`|MqFeJiukaa	The hospital won't send you home if you are in active labor which is usually 4-5 cm|`|OwK17Qo1aa	After 5cm they tend to keep you.|`|LABC73E7aa	my doctor told me 4cm.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I agree with Sher.     Usually they'll keep you in when you're 4-5cm dialated, but depends on if your water has broken and how often contractions are etc.|`|mgLb5Yohaa	When I arrived at the hospital, I was only 2cm, but they still kept me due to the intensity of the contractions (I could hardly talk through them, every 5 minutes). They look at all factors, not just simply how dilated you are.     I actually called the hospital to explain my labor pains were becoming excruciating (I began labor at 5 am that morning, called the hospital 12:45 am, arrived at 1:15 am). They told me to come in due to the intensity of the labor, and see from there if they would keep me. They checked me at 2cm, but one of my waters broke while in the car, and they decided to keep me.    Wait as long as you can, they strap you in a bed with a ton of monitors once you get there. It was torture to lay in bed for another 7 hours!|`|bTlhBX3daa	Dilation is not the only factor involved.    You also have to consider Effacing, which is the thinning of your cervix and opening, to allow the baby to enter the birth canal.     And then there is Stationing, which is where the baby's head is at in your cervical opening.     Potentially you could be dilated to a 5 for weeks and not be going into labor. Though more likely, you would only dilate to a 1 or 2 that early.
aIEkNM0Paa	Tell him|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	My husband was horrified by the idea of a 2nd.  He thought it would be too expensive, too sleep depriving, too exhausting, too inconvenient; the list goes on!    To some degree, he is right in that when one is sleeping, you can no longer sleep because the other will not.  When you feed one, the other will decide he/she wants a drink, something to eat.  Also, my six year old went mad and started kicking up a major fuss, as if we had stopped loving him - he wouldn't speak to me for weeks because I had committed the sin of having another baby.    Despite the truth in some of it, he now adores our new son, he plays with him, changes nappies, helps to feed him, washes bottles, the lot.  I think the fear of the unknown is what gets at men - they hold it inside, but, when they realise it's not as bad as all that, they are fine.    I don't think that he wants to split up, I think he is worrying.  When your new one arrives, he will see, and after a few weeks, it will all slide into place and he will wonder what he did before your new baby came along.|`|xEXb96UKaa	if this pregnancy wasn't planned it might just take a bit of time for it to sink in properly. my husband was the same when i fell pregnant for the second time (also at 20). it wasn't until he was able to see my belly move with the babies kicks that he got excited and started talking about it. just give him time to get his head around the idea of becoming a daddy for the second time. if he says that he loves you, he most likely means it. try not to worry.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	He's scared he prolly remembers how hard it was the first time around and now doesn't know if he wants to go through with that again with another small child to take care of already.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	a second child puts more responsibility on a man who wonders how he will afford another mouth to feed and raise. it is a fairly common problem and he will snap out of it. i know i was scared when my wife had our daughter  with our son being only 9 months old we she got pregnant. God makes ways if we only believe  in Him and ask, for the door will be opened unto you. relax things will work out, they always do if you don't run away from your present task and face it head on|`|175ydQo5aa	OK im a guy, so this is what I think:    You guys had one kid and that killed off both of your *fun years* and now hes 21 your 20 and the new baby is going to be tieing him down for a long time.     Sometimes guys need there space, trust me Ive been with my girlfriend for 3 years and sometimes I just need some time away, not because I don't love her or she doesn't love me, guys just need there own time, to sort things out for themselves, even if its a simple question. In this case its a little more difficult of a choice he has to make, but if he stuck through it once, chances are hes going to Man up and stick with it again.    So give him some space, but let him know you love him and you can understand how he feels.    Yes I am asking that you set aside your personal feelings for a second (i know your pregnant and you have hard times and what not), but your man needs some love and back up, that's what a wife or girlfriend is all about.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	He's scared.  You may have to handle this without him.|`|ecNeN0staa	Hmm...it's too late now.  He should've thought about that when he decided to do it raw with you.|`|rnW8h3vCaa	well that sucks|`|Hqan62xzaa	Keep it in your pants. God!|`|lYDQrqaeaa	Ask him straight up - WHAT IS GOING ON!?|`|6zzte15caa	Its more responsibility for him... He has another kid on the way, fathers notice the lack of food, the lack of time... We notice when our home isn't what it should be... Maybe his worried he can't live up to being a good father...    I doubt it has anything to do with you, I'm sure its just his insecurities  creeping up on him.|`|AA11210405	This is why teenagers need to stay in school and leave the sex and the consequences of sex for the adults.   Obviously you didn't learn your first lesson.  Whether it's a religious reason or not you should be a married adult that has discussed when to conceive before getting pregnant.   There is such a thing as birth control. Haven't you figured that out yet?|`|6d1707346524b5ef865188fea841538aaa	"he stuck by me the whole time"  Sounds like a keeper...  He is nervous just as you are, does he have anyone to talk to like you have your mom? You also said it was stupid of you to get pregnant as if you did it with him, sex while fun often times has ramifications. Give him sometime to gather his thoughts, then talk to him!|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	Abort both children (the older one might be some trouble, but you can do it).|`|Xx84H3Auaa	It will all be different once you have the baby and he gets to hold it in his arms. Its normal to have cold feet. He is probably scared that he cant support you and the baby|`|ai8mtuS6aa	it's just the typical guy thought of ... oh sh*t now i can't go party get drunk etc.  i guess the first time he was too young i dunno really|`|PkcKZfOXaa	maybe he doesny want you to have another baby|`|xx4MSADIaa	Prob dissapointed that you made the same mistake. Stop Having unplanned kids! Silly wee lassie. Poor kids|`|5031cb559a6c3c75778b421b4a8a73e5aa	I also was a young mom and then got pregnant again 2 months after the birth so I know it's extremely difficult. That's probably all he's experiencing, the stress of raising two.|`|FfN4i18Zaa	he loves you but mabey hes just weird because he knows hes never gonna be a normal 21 year old instead hes in a relationship with 2 kids and hes proberbly feeling overwhelmed and trapped! mabey try and give him a bit of space and incourage him to go out with his friends!|`|2QvImMIxaa	gd   gd  whores|`|AA11124210	hope your pregnancy goes well    Try and get him to sit down and talk to you about what he is thinking. It will probably be hard because most guys (or people) don't like to express their feelings and become vulnerable.  It's hard to not get frantic about it and scare him away so be patient but you need and deserve to know what he is feeling and let him know that.|`|5W8NNPVMaa	Sit him down to talk to him. And tell him its important to discuss things early, but if he still need a bit of time. And you'll wait but he need to reassure you things are okay.  Maybe he's just thinking things through.  Hope it all goes fine for you both.|`|FJpshSA4aa	I had the same issue with my 2nd pregnancy (I was also 20!), I think they just know what's coming because they have been through it before (the first time) and know how tough it can be, plus dealing with a 4 year old at the same time! He is probably just overwhelmed right now but doesn't want to run away from his responsibilities or his relationship with you. A lot of men seem to be unusually silent when they are overwhelmed because they don't know what to say that won't make them sound like cry babies. (My husband is that way..)    He probably didn't have cold feet the first time because it was unknown, he probably didn't realize the sheer amount of responsibility that comes with having a child. (Rest assured though, it really is easier the 2nd time around.)     The best advice I could give is to not make any assumptions and wait for him to come to you. Stay very supportive and loving / affectionate toward him, he's probably going through a difficult time in his mind right now organizing his responsibilities in his head.    I just stood by my boyfriend and stayed supporting and affectionate (possibly even bumped it up a little) and now we're happily married, and have been for 2 years!     Good luck to you!    (Also - I saw someone comment about their other child throwing fits over the new baby. Well, talk to your daughter a lot about the new baby coming, and tell her when you bring home your new baby, she can have a new baby too, and get her a baby doll. She can take the baby doll and "feed" it bottles while you feed your new baby, change its diapers when you change your baby's diapers, and so on... It's a way to turn it into a fun learning experience for her. :) I wasn't smart enough to think of this myself, but my sister-in-law did this and I thought it was a great idea.)|`|9v37TLJVaa	honestly i don't, think he expected to have his own life well childhood teenage years etc cut so short. accident or not. you get girls who just keep having baby's just for themselves and don't take other people feelings or there hopes and dreams into account. probably at the age of 21 i guess he didn't want to be tied down. with 2 kids and wanted to do something with his life perhaps?
RPszYGXkaa	I always had a nagging feeling that I would have a hard time getting pregnant when we finally started to try.  But with baby  1 we succeeded the 2nd month, this time is taking a bit longer, but I also have irregular cycles now.  Best advice I have is to KNOW WHEN YOU OVULATE!!!  You are most fertile the 2 days before you ovulate and the day of ovulation.  Get some OPK's (online they are very inexpensive) to help figure out when you ovulate,  I also just started charting my BBT this month and it is pretty neat.  I also recommend reading Taking Charge of Your Fertility, has lots of good info and just helps you understand your body better.|`|pW3G1onIaa	i will start taking prenatals  and its best to stop birth control 3 mths b4 u start try good luck|`|AAbGMKo5aa	Well u should take prenatal vitamins u should stop using ur bc 3 months before december cuz u have to give ur body time to get back to normal and to blance ur homones...|`|m3oA5xLYaa	start taking prenatal vitamins. also i would stop b/c a little early so you can get a feel for your cycles and then know when to have sex when you are actually trying...i wish i would have. It is hard to figure things out when you have been on the pill for 5 years.|`|Worr8ZQOaa	I would start taking the prenatal vitamins a couple months before December and don't stress yourself out.  It will happen :)
2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	Listen to your mom..It is apparent that she is struggling with something, most likely being separated from you..DO you call her on nights when she is with her dad..You should both do this..He should call when you have her and you when he has her..Kids need stability to feel safe .working with your ex on a daily basis is best for her..No matter if u two hate each other the kid should never hear or see any of that..good Luck|`|h6NqNzHAaa	2 year olds mimic the behavior they see. If that behavior is not expressed at your home then I would assume that it is being learned at her father's home. Contact the counselor in charge of your parenting plan and give them this information asap.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	she probably wants to be with her dad... those kind of things affect kids a lot.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	These are all things that she is seeing at her father's house and it needs to be addressed. It may be enough that she shouldn't go over to her fathers house anymore, especially with the teddy bear thing. Talk to whoever is handling your custody case and tell them what is going on. Good luck and hope everything goes well.|`|kzjclCaeaa	Looks to me like she needs to fear authority. Beat her butt. Talk to your baby dad to see were it is coming from. Try to spend more time with her.|`|AA11194223	Hi sorry to hear about a problem like this.Its really sad that you're haveing trouble with you lil one.But you need to know as hard as it is on you.Its harder on her shes only 2 years old and going through so much and cant tell you on her own words just how she feels about what is hurting her also she doesnt understand why your not there with her when shes at her dads and why hes not there when shes with you.Its important not to bad mouth each other about the other one no matter what the reason is.Its very important that she see the both of you together even if its only for deciding what the other  might be doing or letting each othe know what is going on in a respectful manner when you show her respect she will be respectful.Shes so young LOVE the program The Nanny got some very good ideas about how to set rules when not behaveing at any age all the best darling and most inportant thing of all.LOVE HER AND HAVE PATIENT they grow so fast and as hard as it may seem you will one day want some of them days back.All the best God Bless you all
yYSWs9Imaa	YES!!!! it's driving me crazy!! I'm 9 weeks yet, and havn't got a date for my ultrasound yet. Because of the 'baby boom" in my area, I've been warned it will probably be when I'm 14 weeks.    I don't want to tell anyone till I've seen the baby and everything is ok, but I'm showing already so I think they may start to guess soon.    i had a miscariage in August, which just makes it worse. It was at 14 weeks too. I'd had two early scans due to fertility treatement and everything was ok, then went for routine dateing scan (meant to be 12 weeks, but again late) to be told my baby had died.    so anyway it's a pain, I hate this wait, and I'm tempted to go private and get a scan next week, it's only 50................ hmmmmmmmmm........|`|MtU2yH3gaa	Oh my gosh, I was so anxious! I had to wait until 18 weeks to get an ultrasound, so you are lucky you are getting earlier! and obviously the most important thing was finding out if the baby was healthy, but we also wanted to know the sex, and she couldn't tell us! how's that for an anxiety buster!? lol. But we decided we are going to let it be a surprise and even though it's been hard and we still have to wait until May, we feel it will be so worth it! good luck!|`|p0prrzf2aa	YES I'm almost 10 weeks and my 1st ultra sound isn't until Feb 16th and I'll be 12 weeks then :(|`|mdmSrQ5paa	i had to wait till i was 10 weeks preggy to get mine  and even then i wasnt supposed to get it  it was part of a sequence of tests  i go in for my second one on tuesday  and hopefully find out the sex  and make sure my babe is healthy  i am pretty much dying trying to wait|`|Y1Lb5f4Eaa	OMGosh I had to wait until I was 20 weeks before I got my ultrasound. It felt like forever. I had to keep myself busy to not go stir crazy. Now I'm just waiting for May. Seems like it'll never come. :( You don't have that long to wait, it just seems like forever. The week before my ultrasound all the people at work put down bets on the gender. It was really fun to sit around and discuss what they thought it would be. It was even better when most of them turned out to be wrong. LOL.|`|dR2bqUixaa	I'm 12 weeks and 2 days pregnant and my doctor told me that I won't get my first ultrasound til I was around 21-23 weeks. I'm so excited about it. I already heard the heart beat! My husband was more excited than I was. Lol!|`|c1DFk5craa	yes, I did. congratulation for you!|`|8c4kRTnPaa	Absolutely!! I was sooo worried about every little twinge, if I was eating enough, gaining enough. There are so many things to worry about, but try and relax! I have to wait until I'm 20 weeks for my first ultrasound (I'm eleven weeks now) so you are lucky you get to have one so early! Congrats :)
