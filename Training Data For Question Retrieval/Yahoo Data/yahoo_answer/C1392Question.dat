20090307173813AAhucEF	Social Science;Psychology	I feel too old to fulfill my dreams?	I wanted to lose weight, wear cute clothes, take private flute lessons, take private dance lessons, and learn a new language.      I am 21 years old, in college, and feel like I have wasted my life. Am I too old, or do I still have time to do these things? I feel like by the time I become a great flute player, skinny, and can wear cute clothes, it won't matter b/c I won't have anyone to show. For example, if I had this accomplished now, then I could wear cute shorts around campus or perform with the flute.      I guess I feel like once I leave the school world, then my youth-hood will be over?
20090307174057AAmVCrH	Social Science;Psychology	Do other people get as excited  as i do about ruining sumones  day?	or genuinley offending them?, or even having them think seriously about themselves, thats why, for the moment when it sinks in....... into the "real" inner self, not just the quick thinking talking acting conciouseness of the subconciouse, but the "real" conciouse the one that dwells when alone, the one that has fears, the one with anxiety and reflection with desire to BE sumthing, then when u show them what they are, not what they think they're BEING but WHAT THEY ARE!!! those delicate moments i live for, the quivering eyebrow of true penetration............. the ever so slight pause mid sentence, and the knowledge of teaching and showing, i think i realize what brings people to religion now.......

They can reason better than I can, and sometimes I just can't see the picture.       Am I really that stupid? Will I stay incompetent forever? Is this genetically determined?       Sometimes I think nature and nurture plays a role. haha. because no offense to my dad, but he's not quite what you'd consider smart or hardworking and he's not that great of an influence either. I sometimes wish that he'd encourage me to do stuff that will sharpen my reasoning abilities or be an inspiration to me by at least reading a book.      Will I stay stupid forever?

20090307181710AAO7ZiP	Social Science;Psychology	Do I have a right to be angry about my family's reaction about almost being raped?	When I was 12 years old, I was in Africa for the summer visiting my relatives. I am fluent in the language in Eritrea. I was walking one day and this older guy ( in his 20's) that was walking whistled to get my attention. He said to me in the Eritrean language , " Rose told me to take you to her house." I don't know anyone named Rose so I told him that. He repeatedly said that Rose sent him to take me to her house. I looked at the man confused and he said to me," Aren't you going to greet me properly?" and he stuck out his hand so I can shake it. I looked at him strangely and then he said to me in English, " Do you want sex?" Instantly, I turned around to run away and I saw my two friends with their aunt. I ran to them and screamed, "This guy is going to rape me." The man just stood around smirking and I just ran home. It was hard for me to explain to my aunts who couldn't speak English that a man was trying to lure me. I told my cousin that could speak English about what happened but she just laughed it off and said that the man was just kidding and that he did it to scare me. I was horrified by her reaction. I was just almost raped and she just laughed it off? Her older brother said the same thing and said he just did that to mess with me. Instantly, I was convinced that no one really cared so when my dad asked me about it, I just lied and said that it was some kid my age that did that but I scared him away. I didn't want everyone to go crazy over me and forbid me to walk alone. My mother didn't come with me on the vacation so when she called the next day, I told her what happened. Like everyone else, she laughed it off and said, " People in our country would never do that, only people here in the U.S. would do that. There's not much crime in our hometown." I was crushed. That really hurt my feelings. My mom didn't even care. I knew it was because stuff like that wasn't common in Eritrea and it wasn't considered a big deal there. Something like that happened to my sister once and the only one that took it seriously was my aunt and my cousins from Texas. Again my mom didn't really take it seriously.      To this day, I am angry about how no one took my situation seriously. I don't want that happening to any other kid. But my mother was right. There isn't much crime in Eritrea. But that doesn't mean that everyone can just not care about what happened to me.      If I had a child, I would never ever ignore that situation. I was just a kid when that happened and that event traumatized me. The next day I was so scared to even walk out alone. To this day whenever I walk around in Eritrea, I don't feel 100% safe.
20090307180513AAb3jAr	Social Science;Psychology	I am sick of this injustice..is there any solution?	I am in university, in a 4 year course. I am now in my final year, and without a single friend. But that's not all..i'm not neutral with everyone like i had hoped. I am ostracized and treated in the worst possible manner. And my classes are not mixed with people from the other courses. Just mine. No matter how nice I be to people, they continue to be bitter to me. I've tried by best and there's no way out in my view. If I am nice to someone (e.g. giving them a lift), they will act nice to be at that time, and then just backstab me, spread rumors about me (because people in my batch are lame enough to find it fun to talk/listen to stuff about me). If it is groupwork, I won't be informed of private meetings (e.g. at 1 o'clock, we will all go to the computer lab and do the 2nd part of our task), and then they will come and ask me why i didn't ask them when the task is. When I ask them, they will say that there is nothing planned yet. When I tell them to inform me if there is, they will say that there probably won't be anything but just come along to the comp lab and u may find us. As you see, they don't even have basic respect for me. Suppose they see me talking to people in other courses, and if they end up meeting them as well, they will say things like "why are you talking to him, nobody likes him, stay away from him".   If I sit next to anyone from my class, that person will get up and go to the opposite end of the room, and everyone will start smiling. When I am alone, the lecturer may ask me "why are you alone, why don't you cooperate with the others". I am fed up with all this.   As for my social life...you can imagine. Absolutely none. They don't invite me anywhere.   I asked a few 'almost neutral' people in my class what the problem is. They just said that nobody likes me. I asked them why, then they just told me to ask someone else because they are not supposed to say anything. I asked for names on who are the ones who are trying to destroy my name constantly, then they say that they can't say anyone's name.   What should I do???? And please...counselling is not a solution. It won't solve this problem. The problem here is ostracizm, and I want to know if anyone has any suggestions to beat it.

20090307183126AARO2TE	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	How am I supposed to see it as, when it felt so real?	So the other day I was thinking about my ex and then I went to sleep. The dream I had about him that night was so vivid I could have sworn it was real!      We were somewhere with dim lighting, like a closet or in a car. We started out holding hands, and it felt like we were one from sitting so close. My head was on his shoulder, and I was staring up at him. He looked down at me, gave the sexiest smile, then we started making out. Only I reached his lips for a breif moment; I was mainly interested in his neck? He kissed the sides of my face, and my hands/arms, and my lips when he could. I could literally feel the sweat gathering on his chest and neck. I could even hear our breathing, very rapid and heavy. I heard him moan in a very low voice a few times, and me do the same in correspondance. It was amazing, and the whole time I was just thinking about how much I wanted to stay with him like this, and how much I loved him, and how I'd never hurt him like I did when I broke up with him.      The emotions and physical contact were very apparent and strong. I really thought it was happening.       I probably wouldn't have been thinking about it much, except that before me and my ex started going out I dreamt he came to my house and while I was laying down he came up and kissed me on the forehead. I felt that, too! Only it was more innocent, and his kiss was cold and wet and innocent. Not like this one. At all.         Should I take it as just a dream/desire (Although I don't really like him anymore) or take it as a sign for something?         Thanks in advance!

I had more character. I didn't give a damn what people thought of me. Then I moved, and everyone at my new school just automatically treats me with respect. At first I felt uncomfortable receiving compliments and such, but now it's standard. I'll just naturally slip into the schmoozing, and it makes me feel sick. I used to hate those girls who are always smiling and laughing at stupid things. Now I'm ONE OF THEM.      Is there any way I can fit well into society, but still retain the good character I developed from being a loner with low self-esteem? "Funny" is a big part of my personal identity, and now I fear it's slipping away. I don't want to be some average abercrombie flirt. I miss the old me.

She saw me looking so many times, but I didn't care. She is amazingly good looking in an out-of-the-ordinary sort of way. It was more than her looks though - I was drawn to her almost magnetically and I couldn't work out why.      We are now on a placement together and I have come to realise that she is very much like me, which is odd because I'm quite strange! She's a fairly closed off person but she lets me in in small doses - I know it sounds lame but I feel even more drawn to her when she does.       I thought that magnetism etc was something that only existed in films! I just wanted to know if anyone has had a relationship with someone they were drawn to for no real reason, only to discover that they have many (strange) personality traits in common.       More generally - do you think people can be drawn to each other without even speaking and excluding looks?      Thanks

I really need help editing this to something that sounds, reads better. I know as it sits it is not worth much of a grade. Please any constructive criticism you can offer would be greatly appreciated.      While Psychologists and Psychiatrists both share common roots, work in similar environments, and have comparable day to day duties, there are many profound differences between these two often confused professions.      The ancient Greeks and Romans considered psychological problems to be supernatural. Hindu scriptures known as Ramayana, and Mahabharata, describes illnesses of the mind arising from an imbalance of bodily fluids. The Chinese attached the afflicted with an imbalance of Ying and Yang. Each and every culture with the ability to display beliefs in a form of writing, reported a perception of mental illness. It was only a matter of time before the study of the mind became scientific. Psychologists today believe that mental illness is caused by life stresses and maladaptive behavior patterns. Whereas psychiatrists understand the disturbed mind to be of biological in origin. Both seek to understand and treat the unfortunate victims of the mental disorders that has taken hold of so many lives.      To better understand the perception and treatment of each field of study, one must understand the education, philosophy and the foundation of both professions. A psychologist, usually requires either a Ph.D or Psy.D to practice independently. A psychiatrist on the other hand, must acquire a medical degree before pursuing an education in mental health. This is coupled with at least four years of residency; a minimum of three of those four years must be in the mental health field. Possession of a medical degree allows a psychiatrist to administer a variety of medical tests, prescribe medication, and supervise electrotherapy treatments whereas a psychologist cannot. Both do however follow the same law of ethics, and provide similar duties such as educating students in the understanding the mind, conducting research, and, providing psychotherapy sessions. Some of the common places to see a psychologist or psychiatrist are hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, schools, prisons, rehabilitation centers, military settings, and also private practices. Both often work in a collaborative environment as team players to enhance diagnostic abilities, and improve treatment strategy.       The two professions also work individually. A psychologist mainly treats patients who are struggling with life issues. They may help someone adjust to life after being incarcerated, aid a family in the loss of a loved one, help children process the divorce of their parents, a veteran cope with the amputation of his limbs, or perhaps offer guidance to a confused adolescent. A psychiatrist can also do all of the same things, and can offer additional help due to the fact he/she is a physician. For example, patients suffering from schizophrenia may choose the aid of a psychiatrist rather than just a psychologist. This would be beneficial in order to receive medication and therapy from a single source to suppress the voices and delusions in their mind. Though the approach for treatment can be very different, the objective is always the same, both are in a position of service to aid in the quality of life to any given individual.      It is easy to see why these two valued occupations are commonly intertwined as being the same, but there are a number of other differences between the two. For instance, Psychologist and psychiatrists earn substantially different amounts of money. Psychiatrists procure an astounding average of $180,000.00 annually, while a psychologist doesn’t earn half that amount at a mere $59,440.00 per year. Another notable difference is that fifty percent of psychiatrists chose to maintain private practices, whilst a psychologist is more likely to work within an organization.      Many years of sweat and tears have of gone into the experimentation and research needed to further the understanding of the human mind. These two accomplices of service, work together, and individually, to aid our society through times of catastrophe and hardship.

20090307185024AARfGmC	Social Science;Psychology	I'm having feelings towards a friend, but I'm very shy and scared to tell her. What do you think?	That's right, another dating question. I'm 17 and in grade 12. For the longest time, I've struggled with feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. I isolated myself from people for a very long time. Last year, I decided to take a risk and I joined a club. I guess it's a good thing I did because I met this very nice and pretty girl. We have a lot of things in common. We pretty much like the same things and we have similar personalities, although she's much more social than I am. She was in grade 12 last year and came back for another semester this year. She's gone now though and I still try to keep in contact with her. She's going to university after the summer.      Something that kind of surprised me was when she opened up to me about problems she was having and has had in the past. It made me feel good that she was comfortable enough to tell me this, but it was hard for me to figure out why she was exactly. She hung out with a lot of her friends at lunch and I was there too. The nicest thing she said to me was that I was one of her close friends. I've even told her some things about myself and she has listened. She's pretty much everything I've ever wanted in a girl. She gives me hugs a lot and I give her some affection too. She told me I made this one guy jealous that had a crush on her because we were able to do this.      Basically, I think I'm in love with her. I have no idea what the future holds for us, but I want to try to get closer to her. I care so much about her and I want to do whatever it takes to make her happy. I'm going to wait a little bit until I'm comfortable, but I can't wait too long or else she'll slip away from me. I'm worried she may not return my feelings though. What do you think about this?
20090307190442AAIieP0	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Weird dreams I've been having..?	They have been about my ex who I am still in love with but am not talking to right now. He has been going back and forth, saying he wants me and doesn't want me, and all the while he has a girlfriend. Anyways.      The other night I had a dream where I met him and his girlfriend. I thought his girlfriend was awesome, we got along so well (every dream where I meet his girlfriend, we get along) anyways I was so upset seeing them together that while they were at my house, I went into my room and smashed my head against a wall. Afterwards, he and I were cuddling while she looked the other way.      Then last night I dreamt that I had to move to a new house, and my room was damp and cold, and I hated it. When I hooked up my computer I found photos on his blog of him and her lying in bed together and kissing, and I started screaming horrifically. Then I fell to the floor and sobbed. Then I found out that they broke up, but I was still sobbing uncontrollably. And then I stood up and started bashing my head against the wall, the same way I was in my previous dream.      Can someone tell me what this means? As you can tell, I'm very upset with the whole situation. Recently I've started to feel worse and worse, and even suicidal at times.

20090307193011AAghbl2	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	This has me worried; Please HELP?	The other day I had a dream about my ex.       We were in a poorly lit place, and I had my head on his shoulder looking up at him. He finally looked down and smiled, then we started making out. Only you wouldn't really call it that, seeing our lips only met for a few seconds. I was really interested and preoccupied with his neck though?. I felt the sweat on his chest and neck, him kissing the sides of my face and my arms and hands. We were breathing heavily and he'd moan in a very low voice quite often. And I did the same periodically in correspondance.      I've never felt anything like it, neither pshsically nor emotionally. It felt amazing to be there with him. But in reality I don't really like him all that much. Like, I still have feelings for him. But only a little. Not in the way my dream portrayed.      And once before we started going out I had a dream he came to my house and kissed me on the forehead. I remembered how that felt too. Even when I woke up, I still felt the spot he kissed right on my head. And with this dream I can still feel how his neck tasted and felt on my lips.          Could it mean something, like the last dream did?      Thanks in advance!

He is rude to me, my father, and my mother. Do i have the right to kill him? I feel like sliting his throat! jk but he does get extremely obnoxious. He has no respect for anything and anyone, even my friends.

20090307193727AAoUwdb	Social Science;Sociology	When did our society begin to reward children for bad behavior?	In other words, was it always un-cool to be smart?...at least when you were a kid?      Harvard University Press published an interesting article called 'Acting White', about how kids have a degraded quality of life (virtually no social life) during childhood if they study, get good grades, and speak perfect english.       Contrary to what you may initially believe, this phenomenon was not limited to blacks, but included asians and hispanics. The fears of ridicule and embarassment that kids face if they choose to "Act White" are very real, and may lead to psychological problems during adolescent development.       It's awful that kids have to chose whether or not they want to get good grades, and its a totally legitimate argument both ways. Yeah, one kid might not get good grades and he skips school, but he has lots of friends, is very popular, and has a higher quality of life.       If you choose to do well in school, you might be clinically depressed because no one wants to be your friend.       Was it always like this? Well I notice that acting black usually means you are hip and cool, and that so it couldn't have started since maybe the 70s or 80s at the earliest.

20090307194421AAnyc6n	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had this dream which ended with me going to my own funeral through someone Else's prospective.?	So I was fighting some people (like in a video game) and we were shooting people in this dark, old, ghost-town like brick building city and I ran out of ammo which lead to me getting out machetes. I slit this girls throat, by accident (which wasn't very deep at all) and she asked me to bring her to the church. So during the next 30 minutes (or so it felt like) I was carrying this girl and setting her down to kill people periodically in this game like setting. I wake up because something freaked me out and then I fall back asleep. I start the dream coming out of the woods into this grass field with rolling hills and graves, I don't really feel anything as I see the church among other buildings across the field. I do remember that they're the same ones that I just left when I awoke and they seems lifeless and empty unlike before. I walk through the graveyard and I keep on seeing my friends graves, one of which is my best friend jerry.         I read the graves as I make my way across the field, all of which I know the names of my friends. I continue to recognize all of them as I make my way to the church. I stand the lady up and she can walk, she walks into the church, I follow. There we go into the wake of a funeral and we go up to the casket, it's my body. I then realize that it's my friend that I was carrying and that the person that I thought was me was really jerry. They go through the funeral just like we did with our friends the week before. I loved the dream because it made me closer to our friend that passed away, but I know that part of it was because I've been wanting to die for a while now because of the pain I've been going through.      I'm not going to sucide, just wondering if death would be better. That's all.      What does the dream mean?

C.   Fractional reserve banking allows banks to create money through the loaning process.

20090307191915AAQz0Rs	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does it mean to dream of rape?	okay...last night i had a dream that i was a a church meeting thing and my ex boyfriend (who is still my friend) asked if I wanted a ride home, but I said no. since in my dream it was a short walk. but really its not, but in the dream it was where my school is which is 15 minites from my house. anyway, I was walking home and I went pasted the 7/11 store and some guy was in a car with a friend and he got out and started chasing me. Well in my dream it was dusk, and I started running and he caught me, I tried to scream but my mouth was dry, I got out of his grip and ran to where the laundry mat (well where it is in real life) but it was like a dance studio and there were people inside, looking at me, but no one helped. The rapest grabbed me, and of course I cried, begging for him to leave me alone and that I was still a virgin waiting till marrage(which is true), he laughed and said something, but I can't quite remember what it was something like "Oh you  will like it" then he tried to touch me and stuff, but I kicked him and ran again, down past the fire station and started screaming "Gabriel" ( my guardian angel) and I pulled out my pocket knife that I always keep with me. I got into my house. all the curtains where open and when i told my mom (in the dream) she didn't beleive me.      okay I know i wasn't actually raped...but its strange. And I'm scared to death of being raped. I'm only 16, and I'm waiting to be married to have sex...so it can't mean anything about sexual fantasies...can it? I have looked up on alot of sites about it...but I keep getting the same results. Anybody...please...help...I'm despret...my mom doesn't believe in all this stuff...but I do...I don't want to end up a rape victim...

20090307193422AAOJ2Tf	Social Science;Psychology	How can I introduce my experience with diversity for my essay?	I am mixed individual. My mother is mexican and my father is balck. But I spent my life under the sole care of my mexican mother. So, this is an important part of my heritage. I grew up in Southern Texas and I enjoyed learning two speak two languages. I enjoy speaking Spanish and the opportunity that I got to learn in my being able to speak Spanish fluently. I have grow up entirely comfortable with my biracial status, and I am proud to be seen as black even though even if it's not how I view myself.       Diversity is more than an individual’s race and ethnicity. It is about our unique personalities, ways of looking at things, views, and perspectives. Throughout our lives, we all are going to meet people who we interact with that are unlike ourselves. We need to put aside our differences and focus on what each individual can contribute in terms of their strengths and capabilities. I learned this about individuals from different cultures and backgrounds. We are all the same but different. We are the same because we are human beings that are worthy of respect and being treated equally and fairly. We are different because our ideas, personalities, perspectives, and ways of solving problems may be different from one individual to the next. But we need to learn from those individuals to understand and respect what they are about and why they believe as they do. We are all different and can respect each others differences with respect, compassion, and integrity.

When Im home alone i'll go on you tube and watch music videos and if i hear a car i'll look outside and see if my parents are home and click of youtube and pretend i was playing online games.Something scares me to make me click out of youtube and hide the music.theres not bad things about the music.  When people ask me questions i say i dont know a lot. Every day all i do after school is watch tv i never have anyone come over or me go anywhere. At school in some classes i just stare at walls because i dont know who and what i should talk about because i do the same thing everyday. what do i do
20090307194544AAcEFPb	Social Science;Psychology	What area do these points of view come under.....?	Okay, i have a few ideas about the world and humans, and none of them seem to be shared by other people.      Human Anatomy: to me, there is nothing sexually arousing about it, neither male nor female, and not even on a psychological level.      Sex: it's something animals do. It is, or should be something that separates us from them. And its just wrong and degrading in general.      Humans are social?: why are they social? why is it classed as "not-normal" if one decides not to be social.      The world: for the most part, it's a sh*thole, it's probably too far gone to be saved, and is it worth being saved?

20090307200015AAVZjAr	Social Science;Psychology	Should I tell my dad?	Hi guys. I'm taking this medicine called accutane (it clears up acne completely) and I heard it can make you depressed.... I think I am. Do I show signs? I have the weirdest emotions, I'll be alright one minute I'll be happy and the next minute I'll be totally down. Way down... (not suicide down!) I would NEVER even think about killing myself. I cry 2 twice a day more or less because the slightest uncomplimentary things people say to me make me so mad and sad. I'm an B student and I'm having a harder time trying to keep up with it now. I'm lazy and I want to do more, but laziness wins over. I pick the skin around the cuticles of my lips and fingers until they bleed when I'm nervous or sad. I feel disconnected, pretty stupid, ugly, fat, and worthless next to everyone else in my family. I know there's something wrong and I know my dad has been suspicious about me lately, but what do I say? Is what I'm feeling the normal teenage moods or not? Am I just being stupid?
20090307200842AAxoWzS	Social Science;Psychology	Have you ever been in a complete state of depression?	Everyone gets "depressed." That is not what I'm referring to.       I mean to the point where everything is a repetitive process of nothingness, food tastes like nothing, you don't have any desire to leave your house, or do anything else for that matter. All initial hope is permanently gone.       If you have actually been to that point, how exactly did you get out of it? What was your "wake up call," so to speak?       People commonly advise, "hanging out with friends," but that doesn't seem to work for me. It just delays the time I could be wallowing in my own self pity. But I can do it just fine in my head, regardless of my location. And I do, all day every day.
20090307204329AA10zLm	Social Science;Psychology	Could this person be feeling angst?	I have a friend who is a cool guy, but lately (within the last year) he's started to really get into graffiti. We live in a small town and we're both 20, we go to a small branch campus of a major college and there's nothing going on in the way of partying or social interaction. He's never had a girlfriend, but I think it's mostly because he's not exposed to girls that often. So when he's bored, which is very often, he goes to old abandoned houses and spray-paints all kinds of graffiti on them. Weird sayings too, like "We're not who we are." Could he be feeling angst?

It had such an environment that there were lots of snakes in that garden that I was even afraid to touch them while walking… Well I was really scared and then just woke up..      Please honestly answer this dream if you know something about it.
20090307210534AAD4pGg	Social Science;Psychology	Interesting behavior from a girl...  What is she getting at?	I really like this girl...  i've known her for a long time but we lost touch for a couple years.  I started talking to her online a little while ago, like a couple months ago, and before like 2 weeks ago, I hadn't really seen her around my school very much and I never talked to her in school...  That changed a couple weeks ago, and we've talked a few times the last couple weeks...      Anyways, before we actually started talking in person (and this is after a couple months of talking online), I noticed that I was on her top friends on myspace...  And her list only consists of long-time friends, like friends she's had for years pretty much.        It's only been a couple months of us "communicating," and its only been online, aside from the fact that we've talked in person like 5 times the past couple weeks in school.  She's starting to seem shy around me, and I can usually get her to laugh a couple times when we talk...  It always seems like she's smiling while we're having a conversation.  And if I only have the time to say "Hi" she'll usually smile and greet me back.        Do you think the top friends thing was possibly hinting that she might like me, or that she wants me to ask her out?      Thanks!
20090307200329AALTj67	Social Science;Psychology	I am sick of this injustice..is there any solution? Please say something...anything.?	i'm sorry for asking this again, but i'm just looking for more answers.      I am in university, in a 4 year course. I am now in my final year, and without a single friend. But that's not all..i'm not neutral with everyone like i had hoped. I am ostracized and treated in the worst possible manner. And my classes are not mixed with people from the other courses. Just mine. No matter how nice I be to people, they continue to be bitter to me. I've tried by best and there's no way out in my view. If I am nice to someone (e.g. giving them a lift), they will act nice to be at that time, and then just backstab me, spread rumors about me (because people in my batch are lame enough to find it fun to talk/listen to stuff about me). If it is groupwork, I won't be informed of private meetings (e.g. at 1 o'clock, we will all go to the computer lab and do the 2nd part of our task), and then they will come and ask me why i didn't ask them when the task is. When I ask them, they will say that there is nothing planned yet. When I tell them to inform me if there is, they will say that there probably won't be anything but just come along to the comp lab and u may find us. As you see, they don't even have basic respect for me. Suppose they see me talking to people in other courses, and if they end up meeting them as well, they will say things like "why are you talking to him, nobody likes him, stay away from him".   If I sit next to anyone from my class, that person will get up and go to the opposite end of the room, and everyone will start smiling. When I am alone, the lecturer may ask me "why are you alone, why don't you cooperate with the others". I am fed up with all this.   As for my social life...you can imagine. Absolutely none. They don't invite me anywhere.   I asked a few 'almost neutral' people in my class what the problem is. They just said that nobody likes me. I asked them why, then they just told me to ask someone else because they are not supposed to say anything. I asked for names on who are the ones who are trying to destroy my name constantly, then they say that they can't say anyone's name.   What should I do???? And please...counselling is not a solution. It won't solve this problem. The problem here is ostracizm, and I want to know if anyone has any suggestions to beat it.

20090307195129AAuOpVj	Social Science;Psychology	Is being an adult stressful? Do you think its weird that I'm scared of growing up?	I'm 11 and ever since I was 3 Ive always hated the thought of growing up and going to a job, paying taxes and everything. Life seems very stressful when your not a kid anymore. I mean what do I have to worry about? Doing well in school which is very easy and avoiding bullies which is also very easy. Sure I have to share my room with my brothers, do chores, wear hand me downs and have no control over my life but then again that's all I have to worry about. If something horrible happens I have my parents to help. I also don't even know what Im gonna be when I finish college. Everyone of my friends seem to know. So Im just going to enjoy being a kid now and do my best in school and worry about it later. You do grow into growing up right?
20090307200103AAoST7n	Social Science;Psychology	I make mountains out of molehills, how do I stop?	It's not as simple as it sounds. At any given moment when I am blowing something out of proportion, it really DOES feel like a very real big deal in my mind... like the world is coming to an end. Something might seem like it is catastrophic and awful to me at the time. However sometimes looking back over time I realize I blow things way out of proportion. It might be embarassing or hurtful but I make it into an emergency or disaster. In the heat of the moment, I have trouble putting things into proper perspective.        An ex saying something cruel about me to embarrass me in front of people, can seem as disastrous as a night in the emergency room to me, and at the time my mind can't seem to register that it really isn't as bad as all that. It feels so real.       Looking back I realize I do this too much. I'm tired of being in a panic and blowing things out of proportion but I don't know how to stop. Is there a therapy technique or coping skill or cure for whatever this is? I don't like being this way and I want to stop but I don't know how.

20090307202906AAiwoZ0	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Messed-up dream from a stressed-out, sleep deprived mind. What do you make of it?	So, I woke up toward the end of a strange dream this morning. I dreamed that I had dumped my boyfriend of 4 years for my friend who is also the photographer for the play that I am working on. It was very real. I don't remember a lot of details, but I remember being happy in the dream. I feel kind of guilty.      Some background:    My boyfriend and I have been together for a solid 4 years, in which time we have never even fought. We have a wonderful relationship, but sometimes I feel like its a little too perfect.   I was at a work party the night before for the opening of a new show, and the photographer did come up in conversation as part of an ongoing joke between me and the director of my play. I did not drink, however.   The director of the play is in a fairly new relationship, and the two of them are incredibly cute together, and we were hanging out that night at the party.   I will admit, I do find the photographer attractive, but we're just good friends.      I don't know if this is just some strange conglomeration of the events of the night before in the stressed-out, sleep deprived brain that had been active for 20+ hours before finally going to sleep.

20090307180339AAaVDt5	Social Science;Psychology	Do I have a mental issue?	I'm 16 years old home schooled and have a very low social life. I don't talk to anyone in my age group since I've been out of public school. My point is, I walk around sometimes in an big area like my bathroom and day dream about things such as what i saw in a movie or show, only thing is, I'm the hero. sometimes i even day dream that I have super powers. and i would walk around in circles with my ipod playing music and making noises with my mouth. It don't happen everyday just when i'm bored. do I have a major problem? or am I just over reacting? and need to talk with people my age?
20090307173224AAkyfM2	Social Science;Psychology	How to handle disappointment?	I really need some help handling disappointment. Lately, everything in my life has been a disappointment. I feel really depressed about it and I feel like I  have nothing left to live for. I know I sound like I am exaggerating because everyone has disappointment but I've had so many in the past few months that my normal ways of dealing with it have failed me. If anyone has any suggestions, please help.
