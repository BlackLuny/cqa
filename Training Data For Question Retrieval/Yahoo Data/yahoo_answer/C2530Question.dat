I keep the thing going cause I can't afford not to. This code has been bothering me for months now, and nothing seems to be showing as being wrong. The plugs and wires replaced last week, ignition coils checked and and showing good, can't find any vaccum leaks. What else can it be?!?!

20070906162323AAilraf	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Warum Blinken Autofahren nicht oder erst sehr sp?t?	Es gibt in meiner City eine Kreuzung mit Ampelregelung. Eine der Stra?en ist eine Einbahnstra?e und von dieser Kreuzung aus nicht einfahrbar.    Meine Beobachtung berichtet von der Gegenüberliegenden Stra?e also mit Blick auf die Einbahnstra?e.   Ich bin inzwischen zu dem Schluss gekommen das 50-60 % der Autofahrer erst nach oder mit dem einschlagen des Lenkers anfangen zu Blinken 30-35% Blinken gar nicht.    Was soll das Sie k?nnen überallhin nur nicht gerade aus.      Andere Situation: (fast überall) erst bremsen die Fahrer kr?ftig ab und dann zeigen sie mittels Blicken das sie Abbiegen wollen, w?re doch hilfreich wenn man vor dem Bremsen durch Blinken anzeigen würde das man gleich abbremst.   Also: Warum diese Geheimnis Kr?merei oder ist es Blickfaulheit?

Sorry about the poor cell phone quality pics. So I set the dizzy about 3 times in the last few days and the truck (5.7 k1500 w/ TBI) started right up each time. I had to prime the oil pump and after replacing the dizzy and setting it in time it would not start (tried to set it 3 different times). I look to be getting plenty of fuel from the injectors but my spark looks pretty weak. I don't have a multimeter to really test resistance right now and don't work with distributors that often. I'm planning on replacing the cap and rotor so I guess the question is somewhat irrelevant, lol. But what do you think? does it look like there is enough wear/erosion to cause my problem or would it more likely be a coil or other issue?      Thanks...

I'm getting desperate      1999 Pontiac Grand Prix with 3.8L F/I VIN K, not supercharged.  Automatic transmission.      Last Sunday I had driven about 5 miles, the engine was at normal temperature, all seemed normal, and the car stalls while going down the road.  After having it towed home and started troubleshooting.      The OBDII doesn't have any codes   The fuel tank was at 1/4 so I added 4 gallons (another 1/4 tank) of premium unleaded along with a bottle of injection cleaner and Heet.  I've replaced the fuel filter, spark plugs, air filter, and fuel pump.  I can't hear a vacuum leak but my hearing isn't the best and I've only done visual inspections.     After replacing the fuel pump I started the car and it idled fine up until the temperature gauge started indicating.  It then sputtered and died.  In trying to restart it thick clouds of black bellowed out of the tail pipe.      Any further suggestions before I take it to a shop?

20081118132627AAMRO23	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Do Sunpro (or similar) Oil Pressure Gauges work well for diagnosing pressure problems?	I may have an oil pressure problem with my car, so I was going to go get a manual oil pressure gauge at the store to hook up to it and see what the oil pressure of my car is. Do the sunpro gauges (that are meant to be permanently mounted in your car) work just as well for diagnosing pressure issues as an actual testing gauge would? cuz if so Im not going to waste money on a unit that is just for testing when i can have one permanently mounted in the car.
20081118133603AALLFUO	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Install Oil Pressure Gauge in GM 2.2L engine?	What is the best place to add a oil pressure sending unit in a cavalier (not necesarially cavalier, alot of GM/chevy cars (cavalier, pontiac grand am, and others) /trucks (s10) have 2.2L GM engines) (anywhere from 95-01 engines). I had this 18mm "sandwich adapter" that went between the block and oil filter and it had ports on the side, but it wouldn't fit my car. Anyone hooked a manual gauge up to their 2.2L engine?
