aDQCs2yAaa	girls can get in anywhere if they show a bit of clevage|`|NSxdVlKcaa	Well Beauty this world isn't easy nor lovable! I hope you never go to a bar or club, it's not all the excitement as you think. I'd hope you change your mind. Your friend will be the only lucky one if she doesn't get to go. That's my answer. I'm not being mean, just giving you good news for you. Hope you have fun somewhere else!

HfsZisOdaa	I would suggest speaking with a couple of real estate agents. <br>  <br>  ~

YH3ijHncaa	kittt lim is  right|`|RnjuNJ6faa	I did my test 15years back at BBDC too.    I think the best time to take the test is around 10am-11am or after 2pm-4pm.     Try to avoid rush hours and lunch hrs.     Always remember to look neat and polite. Remember to greet the tester and open the doors for him if possible. It didn't work for me but heard from some ladies friend of mine that it helps.    Gd Luck
gUHzqJ9paa	Umm.. I just recommend you don't behave as snobby and conceited as those shallow bimbos in what's in called... oh yeah, "My Super Sweet 16," which airs on MTV. However, I just hope you can recall how shallow and pathetic and desperate they are and how they simply starve attention and how competitive they are to own the night and have the spotlight. Anyway, I want to be a Fashion Designer and Magazine Editor in NYC (aka "THE" City!) when I grow up and also want to own a production company, charity case, clothing line, jewelry line, cosmetics brand, and such... so I also need to have lots of hair stylists and makeup, too, and wardrobe designer. The reason I am telling you all of this, with this so-called "lecture" (LOL) is because even if you don't find JUST the right answer on here, I recommend you googling up places on google and research lots... BEST OF LUCK... Hope other people's answers have more affect with you're curiousity and response. :D
cvRscoQ3aa	At a skate shop or sports store.|`|kNscpF4Faa	In the sporting goods section of any wal-mart|`|iyt2CG0Gaa	hahaha fingerboards ?|`|CkGPIy1Caa	go to the nearest hard ware store
3lsAXL4vaa	no im sorry ma'am i dont know where that is but when i did find them i would give them a swift kick in the baby maker
AA11693263	Yes there is. I was just looking into this for my daughter for next summer. It would be an awesome experience to work there. There is a ton of information on their website about it. It explains the living arrangements, what you should and shouldn't bring with you, perks, benefits, etc. Just go to www.cedarpoint.com and click on the employment button. They have a lot of things that they do for their employees. One of them is closing the park down and having an employee day for them and their families. I am trying to talk my daughter into doing it for that reason alone, lol. Cedar Point has always been our favorite amusement park and we go at least once every summer. We live only 4 hours away but wish it was a lot closer. If it were we would probably be there every weekend in the summer :)
gaXUIduMaa	Futures in currency can be bought and sold just like commodities.  In addition, one could exchange a limited amount of dollars into, say yen.  If there is a major move in either currency on the later, you could make a bundle or conversely have to sell your house and first born.  On the former, if there is a major move on the currency you bought or sold, you also could make a bundle or lose your house.  If the guy is selling the dollar, he thinks the value of the dollar is greater than what he thinks it will be in the future.  IMO trading with the dollar is a foolish move although trading with other currencies or exchanging your dollars to another currency could be a boon but may very well be a bust.  If you want to get political, he thinks that Obama's plans will either fail or take a very long time to take hold.  If the stimulus and other plans do improve the economy, he takes it in the shorts.  <br>  Note that gold is kind of a cross between a currency and a commodity and, although I don't recommend trading in it now, it would be a better approach.
