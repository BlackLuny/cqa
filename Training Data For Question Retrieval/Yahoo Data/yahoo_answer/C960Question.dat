Over the last 40 years, there have been over 6,000 cases of steriod use in the NFL, over 9,000 in BaseBall, WWE only has 128 cases of steroid use.    People keep acting like wrestlers are the only sport that takes steroids, do you think pro wrestling is attacked because its not government supported of funded like the NFL and MLB?

20090202111713AAjrcbD	Sports;Basketball	Do Lakers fans realize that a dunk is worth just two points?	I've gone to quite a few games at the Staples Center and have noticed that their fans tend to celebrate like they won the championship after every dunk.  Sometimes they are celebrating so long that the other team has gone back the other way and hit a three-pointer but they are still dancing and screaming.      Do they not know that a dunk is worth the same 2 points as any other field goal?    Yes I know that fans in general do get more excited about certain plays but no other team's fans take it to the extent of the Lakers.    On a related note, I also wonder if they think that a blocked shot is bigger than any other turnover.  In fact its less valuable as the blocked shot often goes back to the same team who get another possession.  Sometimes that team will still score after having their initial shot blocked but Lakers fans don't even care since they are still celebrating the block.

Bracken, who played in all 17 matches during the voting period, won a nail-biting count by one vote from Michael Hussey, with Shaun Marsh another vote back in third place.      Marsh led by one vote from Bracken and Hussey entering the final game of the voting period -    Bracken collected the maximum three votes for taking 3-38 from his 10 overs, while Hussey was awarded two votes for top-scoring with 49.

Evn though as a SG it is not his job to get assists or rebs, its his job to score when he is hot. The pg handles and dishes and the big men get boards      Now LJ is trying to copy Kobe's performance last night and of course he should get more boards, he is positioned on the floor to reb as a forward.

Sasha is shooting really bad, Sue is never going to see the court, Luke cant shoot or play D, Vlad's D is horrible...Also If we are not going to play Mihm ans DJ then release them and get a big man we can use to help in the post.       Trade some of these dead beats for someone we can use. If they are just filling roaster spaces, people like DJ, Sue and Mihm that we already know Phil wont even play them, well get someone he will try playing.

The computerized ranking of a real life sport is so one dimensional when clearly one has to consider other factors before assigning the designation of World Number 1 or better yet a Champion.  Now the term upstart or rising star may be better suited to those who find themselves in the company of true champions like Federer and the Williams sisters whose consistent top level performances and achievements overshadow those on the come up.        So I challenge you my dear friends to reserve the designation of Number 1 in the world or Champion for those whose credentials make a statistic from a computerized ranking system of little importance and take notice of those in the field whose resumes speak for themselves.

Josh McDaniel, Raheem Morris, etc. Tomlin is is only 36 and he has won a title. I think that people expect young coaches to be soft and let their players run the ship. But it is not so! Think about it for a minute. Tomlin' predecessor Bill Cowher was only 34 when he was coach and made the Steelers contenders within his first 2 years. Jon Gruden brought a title to Tampa when he was 39. John Madden took over for the Raiders when he was 32 and NEVER had a losing season. All of these coaches mentioned had a reputation for being disciplined and had a reputation for demanding excellence from their players. Coaching is about character and proper mindset, not age!

The tire was installed properly, and everything was sitting right (no bulges etc. After about a minute of leaving the tire on at 80 psi, it exploded again.      I just put on brand new rim tape, and there is nothing poking at my tubes, why would these be exploding at 80 psi? it is an old 80s takara road bike if anyone needs to know

Not sure if you guys just dont know, or dont care, but I thought I would make this little list so yall can see his accomplishments before and after their marriage.    Pre-Stephanie:    KOTR winner  Royal Rumble winner  2 European Championships  5 Intercontinental Championships  1 Tag Team Championship  7 Heavyweight Championships    Post-Stephanie:    5 Heavyweight Championships (including a win at No Mercy, which he later lost to Orton that same night)      So im just curious why people think if it wasnt for Stephanie he wouldnt be where he is? Im not hating on anyone, just wondering what your reasons are. Maybe its something I dont see hehe.

20090202150141AArYZkQ	Sports;Cricket	What do you think of these Cricket jokes...?	1. In school, the sports master and English teacher asked one of his brighter pupils to spell "bowling".     Back came the answer : "B-o-e-l-i-n." "That," said he, "is the worst spell of bowling I've ever seen."    2. A slip fieldsman had a particularly depressing day during which he dropped no less than ten catches all off the same bowler. After the game he was talking to the bowler when he broke off and looked at his watch. "I must go," he said, "I have a train to catch." The bowler looked at him bitterly. "Let's hope you have better luck with that, then."     3. The captain looked at his ageing batsman. 'You know,' he said, 'it's a pity you didn't take up the game sooner.'     'You mean I'd be better now?'     'No. You'd have given it up long ago!'    4. An American had been told to go to a cricket match while he was in England. He watched with pleasure as the teams came out and the batsman scored four runs off the first six balls.     Then the umpire called "OVER".    "Well," he said, getting up, "it's a nice game - but it's very short!"    5. In a far-off eastern country, the game of cricket was the most popular sport. Everybody played it, even the royal family. But one day, the king died and a new king took his place. The new king hated cricket and outlawed it, so all the games had to be abandoned.     So that means "REIGN" stopped play    6. An American who knew nothing of the game had been taken to a few cricket matches by a friend and was now studying the end-of-season averages.     Every now and then he came across an asterisk and the words:     'Signifies not out.' Finally, he turned to his friend and said:    'Why don't you get this guy Signifies to play for your side? He's never out !    7. On the day of the local match, the captain was talking to one of his men.   'Look, here's a pound,' he said. 'Go out and buy a new ball or something. Anything that'll help us win.'     The match began and the captain noticed that the same old ball was being used.     He called his man over. 'What did you do with the pound?' he asked.     'Well, you said anything to help us win.'     'Yes.'     'I gave it to the umpire.'    http://www.cricketjokes.com/umpires/9.ht...    5 is my favourite joke :)

Both of these guy were prominent young pitchers and now they can't hit the broad side of a barn with a baseball.    Dontrelle had a change of scenery in Detroit and it only made him worse. Is this partly because of the move to the AL? or is he just having Rick Ankiel disease?      Now Rich Hill has been traded to Baltimore. Do you think he will suffer the same fate as Dontrelle or will he be able to pull through it?? or will he become another Rick Ankiel and not be able to pitch again?    For those of you who didn't know, Rick Ankiel used to pitch for the Cards(before he was a HR machine) and suddenly lost his pitching edge and couldn't find the strike zone and was a danger to opposing batters. So in other words Ankiel was the pitching version of Chuck Knoblach.    Opinions??

20090202154525AADbazR	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	So lets get this right......?	Benitez sold Peter Crouch for ￡10m because he couldn't guarantee Peter a starting place.      He wants to buy a midfielder for ￡18m when we already have Gerrard, Alonso, Mascherano(whom he spent ￡18m on already), Lucas, Plessis.      He is told no, bold & stupid boy. So Rick Parry says lets buy a striker because we can do with someone to partner Fernando because Voronin is a donkey, our other striker can't cross a ball & can't beat players so you play him on the wing & we have the next Henry but Henry at 19 but Henry didn't flourish until he was 25!!!      Enter Robbie Keane, the perfect foil for Torres & Gerrard. After a few shaky games he impresses in the 2-0 win over Everton(I don't think any of the other top 4 teams won there this season?) so Rick says to Rafa, don't drop him Rafa for the next game but Rafa argues he doesn't like players who are good so he drops him.      So from here on every game Robbie scores in, he'll be dropped for the next.      He is sold at a ￡6m loss when he could've just kept with Crouch and we are a striker less, well albeit with the hot & cold Babbel & the other a right winger and the other a waster.      If Rafa wins the Premiership then he is the real tortured genius:)

Some for their attitude/demeanor and others because I think they are boring and others because they just plain annoy me. But what I do not get is most of the people I cannot stand...Have a huge fan base. So I just wanted to list them off and hear from their fans maybe why I should give them another shot. Or for others who do not like them as well to see if it is for the same reasons.      So they are:   Tito Ortiz,Mac Danzig,Clay Guida,Josh Koscheck,Karo Parisian      P.S. My favorite fighters are Rich Franklin,Forrest Griffin,Andre Arlovski,Amir Sadollah,Evan Tanner(RIP),Nate Diaz,Machida,Chris Leben.

20090202161321AARPAJC	Sports;Cricket	Is Steve Waugh Correct?	Former Australian captain Steve Waugh believes Cricket Australia's decision to rest Ricky Ponting could raise question marks about the skipper's involvement in the Indian Premier League.      Ponting will sit out the next two limited overs matches against New Zealand to break up a hectic schedule which includes Test and one-day series against South Africa and New Zealand.      Waugh says Ponting may need to reassess his involvement in the India's Twenty20 competition.      "There's never an easy time for a captain to rest," said Waugh, who captained the Test side between 1999 and 2004.      Do you think Steve has something here or do you think he is making something out of nothing?.      Do you think Ricky needs to have a rest before we got over to South Africa?

20090202161956AAywpmS	Sports;Wrestling	Good news everyone on the supposed Trish Stratus match on WM 25?	Good news everyone on the supposed Trish Stratus match on WM 25?   SLAM! Wrestling conducted an interview with former WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus at an autograph signing this past Tuesday in downtown Toronto. Stratus was signing copies of Inside Fitness magazine and wrestling memorabilia for her loyal fans.      Stratus discussed her one-off appearance on Raw last month. She said she practiced her "Matrix" move "at least 40 times" prior to the show (which she used against opponent Santino Marella) to make sure she could still do it. Stratus also said it would be hard to pass off wrestling at WrestleMania 25. Stratus said she had not been contacted about appearing, but left the impression that something could come together in the future.      "I would definitely like the chance to finish off what I started with Beth in a one-on-one scenario," Stratus said. "No tagging out, no Santino shenanigans, just one dominant female against the other."      Stratus also said she wouldn't mind wrestling another WWE Diva in Natalya.      "Nattie I think is going to be a major player soon, given the right chance to do what she does best," Stratus said. "Everyone knows how much I respect the Hart lineage, using Bret's sharpshooter in my retirement match, wearing the pink and black boots in Toronto ... it's not a coincidence. So I would be honoured to face someone who is a part of that legacy and I have no doubt in my mind that we could blow away an audience."         She did not say anything about that overrated skinny twit Michelle McCool. After all this hype they have been giving McCool that just shows that Trish knows who the real female wrestlers are. What do you guys think about that.      I am glad she did not say anything about McCool this woman is getting too much tv time and storyline.      What do you guys think about this

I wanted to know what kind of supplement(protein shake) I should take order to gain more strength, athletic ability and strength!   Now, I dont want ppl telling me to take steroids. That's just ridiculous.   I also don't want any supplement that increase ur horomones. I'm a teenager I already got enough horomones going on in my body.   Also, when I lose weight like hardcore, I get a six pack but when I eat a lil, I become fat right away. How can I keep that six pack and gain weight so I could bulk up? Any suggestions?      And my question was what kind of supplement(protein shakes) should I drink or take so I could gain 20pounds all muscle?   please name the brand and exact name of the product

20090202164819AAKGefJ	Sports;Football (American)	Why are touchdown celebrations becoming a concern to NFL Officials?	Watching the superbowl last night, (rooting for the Cardinals), I noticed that after Santonio Holmes caught the game winning TD, he performed a touchdown celebration in regards to LeBron James' "chalk throwing" ritual that he performs before every game.      Now, I have read that the NFL officials from last nights game missed it, and did not penalize Holmes. I dont even know why this would be a concern.      What is the point of even brininging it up?

20090202165113AAVTuKU	Sports;Basketball	Do a coach's duties depend on what sport they coach for?  If so, what are a basketball coach's duties?	I know a coach whom people have told me doesn't know how to do their job as a coach.  So, I'm just curious to see what any basketball coaches, coaches in general, or experienced basketball players would have to say about what should be required of a good coach.        Most importantly, would they put someone on their team who clearly has an intense love of the game, a positive attitude, great work ethic, and good overall skills(especially in shooting), but just needs a better knowledge and understanding of the game, and then work with them in preseason to get them caught up in knowing and understanding the game before the season starts.      ...I'm sorry, I know it's a tricky question.  However, if you're a basketball coach, coach in general, or an experienced basketball player, or even if you're just some random person perusing questions about basketball and really feel like you have an answer this one, I strongly encourage you to give it a shot.  =)

20090202120850AA0ENUx	Sports;Basketball	Do you think LeBron is really a great off the ball defender?	He's not a liability anymore when he's defending someone straight up but I don't think he's a great on the ball defender like people think he is. Most of his steals and blocks come off when he's defending someone else. People only look at stats instead of game. I think Paul Pierce has a hard time against him because he's not that quick and LeBron has a huge size advantage on him. He's also quicker and faster than Pierce which makes it hard for him to get to the basket. When I think of how many players have won the DPoY award in the past (Jordan, Rodman, Payton etc.) or the players who were snubbed, (Pippen) LeBron isn't anywhere near those players defensively. I think the DPoY award should go to KG (leading the #1 defense in the league) or Dwight Howard (leading the league in rebounds and blocks). It wouldn't suprise me if LeBron got it though because of those Tayshaun Prince blocks that he's always getting.

Check out the tape. Right around the Cardinal twenty yard line #56 of the Steelers pushes #34 of the Cardinals in the back allowing Harrison to continue on towards the endzone. Look very closely and you will see a ref in the background with a clear view of the infraction. And yet he does not throw the flag. You tell me. The poor Cardinals had to play against both the Steelers and the refs. and you can not tell me that the NFL didn't want the Rooney family to get their sixth SB victory.
