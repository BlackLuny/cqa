I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!

BG8vMyZjaa	My friend takes them when she can't sleep.  She says they work well and don't leave her feeling peculiar in the morning.<br>  They are non addictive, diphenhydramine is an antihistamine.<br>  <br>  <br>  What are the main ingredients in Tylenol PM?<br>  Each gelcap/geltab/caplet of Tylenol PM contains 500 mg of the pain reliever, acetaminophen, and 25 mg of the sleep aid, diphenhydramine HCl.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  I would rather try diphenhydramine (if in USA) or Nytol (if in UK) before considering SSRIs.  Read the side effects below.<br>  "Most people have either minor, or no, side-effects. Possible side-effects vary between different preparations. The most common ones include: diarrhoea, feeling sick, vomiting, and headaches. Some people develop a feeling of restlessness or anxiety. Sexual problems sometimes occur. It is worth keeping on with treatment if side-effects are mild at first. Minor side-effects may wear off after a week or so"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/23068871/" rel="nofollow">http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/2306887...</a><br>  <br>  If difficulty in sleeping persists please see your doctor.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Rather than taking drugs, it would be better to try and get to the underlying cause of your sleeping problems. You should really see your Dr. Are you under stress at the moment? If so, an SSRI and/or CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) may be more appropriate in resolving your underlying problem.<br>  <br>  The problem with Tylenol PM's is that although it is non-habit forming, you can become psychologically addicted to it and  your unconscious mind will start to believe that you can't sleep unless you take it. <br>  <br>  If you continue using it the risk is that you will soon not be able to sleep without it and this could lead to a downward spiral and all the time the underlying cause of your sleeping problems have not been identified. Chronic use of Tylenol can also cause liver dysfunction over time. <br>  <br>  Basic things you can do are to reduce caffeine intake and take regular exercise. If you are really stuck,  it would better to take diphenhydramine on it's own or in the form of Nytol- again the above still applies but at least you won't be taking the other ingredient in Tylenol.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  As Bella or Ditsy has correctly stated in her edit, "Most people have either minor, or no, side-effects"<br>  <br>  The fast majority of people who take SSRIs do not experience adverse side effects at all and any side effects which are experienced are mild. If the sleep problem is persistent then CBT is a good solution which has a 70% success rate. In the UK, there are long waiting lists for CBT so Drs often prescribe an SSRI in the meantime if anxiety etc is factor in your insomnia. <br>  <br>  If you look at the side effects for ANY drug, they will all show unpleasant side effects- the fact is, the vast majority of people will not experience side effects. There is no way of knowing who will experience side effects and to what extent. It's trial and error. Any mild side effects from the SSRI are better than getting yourself into a vicious circle with sleeping tablets/aids.|`|LirTrcZraa	I took tylenol PM once and it had the reverse effect on me, meaning, rather than knocking me out, the pills made me unable to sleep at all, I had insomnia from this medication. If you're someone that this works for you're golden, but it could keep u up all night so beware
fwpu4jL3aa	Experts recommend that you accumulate one hour of physical activity every day to stay healthy or improve our health. Obviously this is also good if you are trying to lose weight and keeping it off.<br>  <br>  The rule is the more intensive the activity is, the shorter the duration of exercise. As you progress into activity with moderate intensity, you can cut down to 30 minutes a day for four days per week.<br>  <br>  There are 3 types of exercise that your body needs to keep healthy - cardiovascular, flexibility and strength. Cardiovascular activities are those ranging from moderate to vigorous exercises.<br>  <br>  Here are some of the light, moderate and vigorous activities:<br>  <a href="http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008/08/31/lose-weight-by-creating-your-own-exercise-program/" rel="nofollow">http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008...</a>|`|8SRjELNBaa	Smaller meals more frequently.

tMtBe1lKaa	Oh sweetie, I'm sorry. <br>  <br>  You need to look back and see if this is a newer thing-  or if it has been going on a long time. Are your interests in other hobbies still the same, or are you less interested all around? are you depressed? Molestation can change a person's sexual practices, but so can fatigue, dehydration, discomfort with or not accepting oneself, a lover with baloney breath :), and depression or a multitude of physical problems. Sometimes the depression and the molestation can add ontop of each other and make things far worse. <br>  <br>  Go to your doctor and be frank with him/her. Look for any other symptoms also.  A good doctor will take enough time to listen to you. It is important that you feel heard. Also, eat good foods for you, get enough rest and try to get away from unnecessary stressors. see if this helps. <br>  <br>  Best of luck, and I hope this helps!|`|Fq3vo0kOaa	Some victims of childhood molestation can be virgins until their late 20's or early 30's..or until they overcome the molestation from their past..

tkDfqjQdaa	An overgrowth of yeast in the body is second to allergies in causing itching in the ear canal.  Some other signs of yeast in the body would be frequent yeast infections, athletes foot, jock itch, headache, fatigue, thrush, indigestion, gas, bloating and many more.  If you have some of these other symptoms, you may want to try a good internal yeast cleanse program.  If not then I would use a good ear flushing system to clean the ear canal (you can get them at drug stores) and then put a good garlic ear oil (you can find them on line or in a health food store) in the ear to kill any trapped bacteria or fungus that may be causing itching.  If it is really bothersome or if you start to show signs of infection (like pain, redness, fever, etc) then go to the Dr.

But my husband can smell my smell and I guess I smell sweet like a sweet summer breeze (he just told me.. he's weird sometimes :) ) <br>  As long as it doesn't smell fishy you are fine. Fishy means that you have a yeast infection.|`|CGFAPKJOaa	An odor from your vagina has nothing to do with hygiene. Different smells are signal different infections. A strong, fishy odor is often a sign of Bacterial Vaginosis; a dough-like smell is a sign of a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Infections are not caused by poor hygiene, rather you may be "too clean." Using scented soaps, douches, wipes, sprays & sex. Use a mild, non-scented soap (Aveeno) and hot water to wash your vagina. Taking an occasional hot bath will also help to "deep clean you." Also, ALWAYS sleep bottomless. It allows your vagina to breathe & air out. Air kills bacteria. Drinks lots of water and eat plenty of fruits. Foods that contain garlic ESPECIALLY cause an odor of the vagina.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|l4CnxvdRaa	It varies from woman to woman, but if it smells really bad, it could be an indicator of some sort of infection.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below to view some information about a healthy vagina as well as some vaginal infections (it mentions odor).|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Tart yet sweet.

What you eat is your diet so if you think about it you are always on a diet.  <br>  The best way to lose weight is to exercise and eat healthy. You need to eat a lot of fruits, vegetables and lean meats. Good fats, such as nuts and avocado, but those in moderation just as you should any high fat food. Exercise: if you dont exercise a lot right now, ease into it, start with 2 days a week and work your way up to 7. And switch it up, otherwise you will bore yourself. One day do cardio and the next do strength. Also drink a lot a lot of water. 8-10 lg glasses of water a day. Also 3 glasses of skim or 1% milk daily can help regulate body fat.<br>  <br>  My story is that I gained about 40 lbs when I was pregnant. I weigh less now that I did before I got pregnant.

It's about a life style. People think that changing what they eat will change who they are. I played football for most of my life and I was required to gain and maintain a high weight. I played at 285 pounds. After I tore both my shoulders I was unable to play and my career was over. My lifestyle changed and I am at a healthy 215. There was no magic diet to it. Hard work and dedication. Commit yourself to loosing weight not only on your input (food) but your output (lifestyle). Enjoy life, have fun, and play harder. It will make loosing weight a lot easier. I stuck to my six to seven meals a day plan. I stuck to hitting the gym 3-4 times a week, and the results do not lie. Commitment, commitment, commitment.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	ya!

Unfortunately, I just had to gain will power, mainly. Weight watchers did help though. I made an excel sheet everyday of what I ate and how many points I used at each meal. In no time, I was at my goal weight.
LaCj6C8Raa	This is really something that you should have a doctor go over with you.|`|UMvB3fzsaa	The first one says your spine is aligned normally, but there is a fracture in one of your spinal vertebrae in the thoracic region, resulting in it becoming shorter. <br>  Edema is the collection of fluid, and there is none around the site.  <br>  A Schmorl's node is when some of the cartilage from your vertebra sticks into either the vertebra above or below it.  Yours is on top.<br>  The osteophyte complex is two of your vertebrae (yours is in the cervical region or roughly the neck area) that stick out.<br>  Also, your actual spinal cord is unaffected.<br>  They go on to say that if they think there might be a lump, you will probably get another MRI with dyes to get a better view of what's going on.<br>  The CT scan just says that you had a compression fracture of your thoracic 9th vertebrae and that at that time there were soft tissues that swelled around it.  The conclusion says that you probably developed this over a period of time.

Drink 8 lg glasses of water daily.<br>  <br>  Also if you are trying to get in good good shape you need to mix it up. Otherwise you will develop muscle memory and will "hit a plateau" you need to trick your body and trick your muscles so they continue to work and not just "go through the motions" One day do those videos and the next day run or do yoga (just examples) Just make sure to mix it up and have fun but work hard and keep it up.|`|GJb2OSrnaa	hydrate yourself, keep going for a week or 2, you'll feel it....cardio helps you lose weight but only if you do it forever...<br>  <br>  cardio always helps you lose weight, but the numbers don't change...ur just building muscle, unless you remain constant|`|aYZXi6ffaa	With little information I would assume that you are pretty healthy to do this active workout and not sweat.

A friend of mine did the same thing and she hasn't been getting along with anybody.  She gets offended easily and lost a close friend because of this.  If he sees her, he leaves and refuses to have anything to do with her.

Also, counseling can be helpful, even if it's just for support.|`|ehq6W1mtaa	Ever heard of the placebo effect? It's the effect that a person has when they expect a certain outcome based on what they are told will happen. You probably didn't need Effexor XR for six years and you were taking it because you thought you needed it. Now that you're off of it your body is still trying to tell you that you need it when in fact you don't. If you really believe that you are a danger to yourself or anyone else you should probably call a doctor but your reactions may be the placebo effect of the ending of medication or the stress that you feel trying to revert so quickly back to your normal life.

Nicotine is 1 of only 3 chemicals that can get through the blood-brain barrier in your head. When nicotine is absorbed into the blood-brain barrier, it kills brain cells. Your brain also gets dependent on the nicotine. If you keep going, your body won't be able to have much energy without nicotine, you will get very irritable because your brain is making your body feel angry unless it gets what it wants. I am only telling you these true scientific facts because I started smoking at age 14 when my cousin died, and almost ten years later, I can't quit easily. My thoughts are with you. Good Luck.|`|AA11850523	you will stop when you really want to

DrXWucWpaa	Of course being overweight (if she is) will affect her health, and as she gets into teenage years she will develope low self-esteem... but also try not to make a huge deal of it to her.  If you can, go for a walk with her every day, try to get her to go swimming with her friends/ family at a pool every once in awhile..  Get her into sports like soccer, volleyball ect.  A few sweets here and there should be allowed, afterall, she is only nine.  Although, try having veggies & dip for snacks vs. chips, candy ect.  Get her drinking diet soda, crystal light (low cal drinks) instead of sugary things.  Basically, be active and when it comes to food get her to choose the healthier choice...over time she will gradually lose the weight, in a healthy way  :)   Goodluck|`|MoFrhr0iaa	Do not focus on dieting but rather health and maintaining her weight.

You always have to go to the root of the problem. The binging is only the symptom.  You can just decide to stop binging, or try using meds like antidepressants etc.  but they would all be just band-aid solutions.  The root of your problem is what is causing the emotional distress that is making you want to binge.  Figure that out and your binging will stop.  You see, when you feel distressed your mind will want to find something to pacify this anxiety, that's were the craving for fatty and sweet comfort foods come from because these make you feel calm when digesting it.  But then you start a viscious cycle here, Undealt issue = emotional distress = cravings & binging = fear of weight gain = taking corrective measure = an additional issue = emotional distress and so on.  And during this time you are creating a state of crisis in your body, your body will go into a starvation mode if you decide to purge the food on a regular basis, and then any little amount of food you will eat, will be stored as fat as a survival defense.  Then losing weight gets harder.  So it is so much easier to just take the time, to sit down and get to the root of the problem and fix that, than trying to manage that viscious detructive cycle.<br>  <br>  hope this helps;|`|rt3wnxw0aa	Replace food with something else.

If you are lifting more regularly than before, then added muscle will bring your weight up. Muscle weighs more than fat does. <br>  <br>  Your body shouldn't gain weight as a self-defense unless you're starving it by eating very very little. <br>  <br>  Be sure you weigh yourself without shoes and jeans on. Your shoes can weigh up to 5 pounds sometimes. Jeans also are very heavy. <br>  <br>  Also, drink plenty of water. You could be experiencing water gain if you're not drinking the amount of water your body needs. Water is a natural diuretic. The more you drink, the more your body will release. So to lose water-gain, we drink MORE. At least 8 glasses a day.<br>  <br>  Ok then! Peace!!|`|kB4EJUKgaa	Yep! It's just that! Your body has to readjust itself to the new regiment of food and exercise. With the decrease in calories and fat, your body thinks it is being starved.

R9KvEhMxaa	It certainly depends. It's important to keep in mind that plants, lacking mobility, physical weapons and a host of other abilities common to animals have primarily evolved complex and varied chemical compounds as a means to prevent being eaten - these compounds generally originate as poisons to the plants specific predators. This of course, provokes competitive evolution between the plants, and the predators that consume them. Plants evolve a variety of different and more potent compounds, and the creatures that eat the plants evolve ways to get around the chemical defense mechanisms. <br>  <br>  This can be useful. Since all animals share a common lineage, there is quite a bit of similar chemistry between them, as such, an molecule created by a plant that disrupts a biochemical system in an insect that consumes the plants leaves, may have similar action against similar enzymes in a human. However, humans are quite divergent from insects, and substantially larger. Moreover, once a useful enzyme is evolved, it tends to get modified, recycled and repurposed for uses in other areas. A prime example of this is the serotonin receptor, a type of GPCR, which originated as a receptor in the intestinal tract, and was repurposed for use in the brain.<br>  <br>  Given the wide variety of plants out there, these serve as a useful source of a variety of compounds, however, these are not necessarily immediately useful. A prime example of this is Reserpine.<br>  <br>  Reserpine is a compound that was found in the Indian Snakeroot, and it is the progenitor of essentially all modern antipsychotic medications. While Resperine is a potent antipsychotic, it induces near lethal side effects in about half the people who take it. However, because the chemical structure of Reserpine is known, notably the tricyclic ring motif, the chemical can be altered, redesigned, and tested in a variety of different forms to find something that is less problematic. Reserpine let to Thorazine, and later Haldol, which though far from ideal medications, were far superior than Reserpine, as it didn't nearly kill half the people taking it.<br>  <br>  Another example would be when the plant does not contain enough of a molecule to be useful. A good example of this is Taxol, one of the most revolutionary chemotherapy drugs that basically turned dozens of lethal cancers, mostly in children, into readily treatable conditions. Taxol is found in the bark of the Pacific Yew tree. However, it is present in such low concentrations, that to gather enough to study it would have required tens of thousands of trees. This, obviously, is not viable.<br>  <br>  Another problem, and perhaps the primary one, is that most of these compounds do not contain just one substance with a physiological effect. The raw plant is a cocktail of thousands of chemicals, virtually all of them unknown. Frequently, you get a very large number of unwanted components that have a variety of unpleasant effects. An ideal example of this is the often mentioned St. John's Wort. This plant contains a compound called hyperforin, which may or may not have useful amounts of antidepressant activity, it alone in pure extract has a variety of unwanted effects. However, St. John's Wort also contains a compound called Hypericin, which is a massive system of conjugated aromatic ring system which absorbs light across a huge spectrum and is responsible for photosensitizing skin.<br>  <br>  These are not good things.<br>  <br>  Moreover, when dealing with medicine, it is important to be able to deliver a reliable dose. If an ampule were to contain 1 unit of insulin, but sometimes contain 50 units that's a problem. This is a severe issue when dealing with raw plants - as the content can in no way be reliably assured without an exhaustive amount of work. Moreover, the way the laws are structured in the US, there is no requirement that herbal products contain consistent or reliable amounts of active ingredients, or be free from contamination. If that insulin contained, say, heparin as well, or god forbid something like clostridium spores, that would be a problem. When you're dealing with a pure compound that has been manufactured with pure components with proper technique, things like this aren't an issue, unless someone screws up. With herbal supplements, there are no laws in place to prevent screw ups, or punish those that do happen.<br>  <br>  It's frequently claimed that you can't patent something that's a natural product, and that you can't make money off it. This is rank, steaming, and false. Look at Taxol. The way the entire system is set up at the moment, there are quite a number of ways to insure that a company that puts forth the money and research to test if a product is safe and effective gets to make back their money without being jumped on. Exclusivity is the main one, but patent law is inordinately complex, and unfortunately, frequently exploited.|`|AA10481903	The premise behind your question is incorrect.  Medical researchers are doing a massive amount of research on herbs.  I just did a search on Pubmed (where you can access most of the world's medical research) and found 12,197 scientific papers using the search terms "herbal medicine" and 25,373 papers using  "herbal therapy".<br>  <br>  The real issue may be that many medical doctors are biased against herbal supplements.  This is probably due to bias in their training and a total lack of knowledge/training in the subject (medical doctors receive NO substantive formal training in nutrition or herbal medicine).<br>  <br>  Best wishes and good luck.|`|F1OIGwtBaa	The scientific community has very strict standards of testing and proving the efficacy of any chemical, whether from a plant or synthetic. Understanding the FDA process of drug approval will help answer your question.<br>  <br>  First - the testing of any potential drug is a very long and extremely expensive process to complete per approved methods. Not a criticism, just a fact.<br>  <br>  Second - natural substances cannot be patented by drug companies. When a pharma company spends many millions on testing, they need to be able to patent their new drug to recoup their investment.<br>  <br>  Third - the FDA requires that all drugs be made by synthetic means. This assures (supposedly) that every pill in every bottle in every batch delivers exactly the same dose. It also assures that if the chemical constituents of a plant change or the plant becomes unavailable that the drug can still be manufactured. The beneficial phyto-chemicals found in plants must be synthetically reproduced to be approved by the FDA.<br>  <br>  Fourth - to be approved as a drug, the lethal dose must be established - how much it takes to kill a batch of rats. Many natural substances are not lethal in any quantity, though many are.<br>  <br>  Some other things to consider - doctors are responsible for what they prescribe or recommend their patients to to effect their health. The benefits and risks of everything must be clearly spelled out. Also, we need our medical professionals to be well trained in anatomy, diseases, and effective drug treatments. There are others who are trained in the natural methods to better health.<br>  <br>  Medical malpractice insurance only covers FDA approved substances. If they recommended a natural substance that had a negative effect, they would not be covered by insurance. (there are 'integrative physicians' who are trained, licensed and insured for both allopathic and natural medical practices)<br>  <br>  Medical insurance does not cover herbal supplements, making it more expensive in many cases than the co-pay on prescriptions.<br>  <br>  To find effective herbs for one's own issue requires a lot of time researching what's available. It can also require a lot of hit-and-miss, plus knowing the difference between the cause of one's problem and the symptoms. The symptoms are usually the uncomfortable, noticeable ailments, but addressing only the symptoms will not help the underlying cause. This may be one reason that so many medical pros are against the use of herbs - because self-diagnosis can be a dangerous folly.   <br>  <br>  There are many professionals out there who are well trained in natural healing. Most of them quietly go about their business. The ones that you see on infomercials can be questionable in their training and integrity, This shines a bad light on the entire industry.<br>  <br>  The information above is very incomplete, but hopefully it will help answer your questions.<br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	I don't think that goes for all scientists.  Some scientists came up with some of the stuff that I take on a daily basis.  Herbs are more natural and more effective and less expensive to me.  The pharmaceutical industy is so large though, it's easy to convince them otherwise.|`|8ntnP79paa	Scientists do not "trust" herbal supplements, because there has been no scientifically backed up research about the effectiveness of these supplements.<br>  <br>  Medicine, although derived from plants has been proven, by studies that have been published, or validated through other scientists.

HmeOD3cgaa	You should decide whether you are too sore to train again. The pain could be from lactic acid build up which means you haven't been stretching enough or it could be that you are working too hard and straining your muscles.<br>  <br>  it is really up to you to realise when you are too sore, because if you train when you are sore then you will be unable to keep it up and one rest day will not be enough for your muscles to re-coup meaning that you will start your next 'on-time' still stiff. When this happens it isn't good in the long run.<br>  <br>  If you are only a little sore from the excersize then continue, but easily and gently so that your muscles aren't hurt badly (strains etc). <br>  <br>  Also, be careful with joints (Ankles especially) because when your muscles are sore they are les able to support your joints, making the chance of an injury higher.<br>  <br>  My advice is that if you are in pain from your muscles when walking normally on flat ground, then have a break. Remember too that you have to ease into training, too much at once is bad in the long run...<br>  <br>  Hope this isn't too long|`|aaCMNSB2aa	First I want to say don't overdue yourself. If it's painful then stop; if it's just aching you may continue. What your feeling is Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, or DOMS. DOMS is caused by tiny microscopic tears in the muscle as a result of high intensity exercise. In other words, you feel pain because your muscles have been literally ripped. Don't freak it's not as bad as you think, that's just how your muscles build to keep up with your activities.<br>  <br>  Most body builders work a certain area one day, then work on another area the next day and so on and so on. They do this till the first areas muscles can heal over before they rip them again. This proses allows them to grow as much as they can and be stronger in the long run.<br>  <br>  Although, if you want to have slender muscles keep with the cardio, ease up on the weight training and don't worry about exercising when there is some soreness- unless, you feel enough pain to effect how you preform throughout the day. If that's the case stop and wait.<br>  <br>  Before you do any type of new exercise or dieting it's best to consult your doctor. Make sure you add this question to a list of things you want to discus with him/her.<br>  <br>  to help heal your sore muscles faster take a cold bath to help tighten and heal. Then after a while a warm one to help them loosen up and stay flexible. If you like add epsom salt (I get it at walmart) to the warm bath.<br>  <br>  --Good Luck, CutieNiki|`|CWY0szzoaa	depends on how long you have been doing this workout<br>  if you just started, it is normal for your thighs to be sore, just keep on doing low intensity workouts everyday until your legs get used to it and advance from there<br>  <br>  if you have already been doing this workout for a while, and your legs are sore, take a day off.  if they are still sore the next day, you might want to consult your doctor or your personal trainer|`|OXB8EpDQaa	Take a short jog with no sprints. It will help loosen up your legs. But dont make it to long or it could make the soreness worst.<br>  <br>  You can also take a warm bath and stretch you legs often. Also eat alot of protein because thats what is going to re-built the torn muscles and take away the soreness.<br>  <br>  Edit: Dont listen to Brenden|`|nlGXGRLvaa	OMG now we have to tell people when it's okay for them to continue exercising or not.  How hard is it to listen to your body.  We have something called PAIN for a reason you know.|`|3BfNshHYaa	take a hot bath and ur legs should feel better<br>  <br>  but if that doesnt work then maybe u should take a break|`|kyTBaYFlaa	it is ok but you should try to rotate in some different exercises and not do the same thing every day.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Hell yeah you should run!!!<br>  <br>  1) Lactic acid is the Spartan’s friend. The Spartan knows the value of anaerobic failure, and actively seeks it out. If he falls on his face, he waits only as long as necessary to move again before he continues.<br>  <br>  2) The Spartan takes no breaks between exercises, unless it’s to shove a non-Spartan out of the way.<br>  <br>  3) The Spartan runs. He does not use Stairmasters, or stationary bikes, or ellipticals. He runs.<br>  <br>  4) When the Spartan cannot run, he walks. When he cannot walk, he crawls. When he cannot crawl, he has failed.<br>  <br>  5) The Spartan hits big muscles, like the back, the pectorals, the quadriceps and the glutes. He knows this means he is building functional muscle that will assist in the destruction of his enemies and in the production of testosterone (of which the Spartan has more than the average man).<br>  <br>  6) By contrast, the Spartan does not waste much time on small muscles. They will grow as the result of functional exercise that hits the big muscles (see above). For example, the bicep is only useful in that it assists with chin-ups, and scaling enemy fortifications. Anything else is vanity.<br>  <br>  7) The Spartan abhors cables and machines. This is for two reasons. First, to activate stabilizer muscles, the Spartan must depend on himself to balance the weight, not a machine. Second - look up the adjective “spartan” in the dictionary: “strict and austere.” You should be able to do a Spartan workout in a FOB.<br>  <br>  8. The Spartan fears only one thing: his workout. The enemy pales in comparison to his workout. If he doesn’t fear his workout, it isn’t hard enough.<br>  <br>  9) Puking is acceptable. Quitting is not. If he gives up here, he gives up in battle. This is unacceptable.<br>  <br>  10) So nature abhors a vacuum, so the Spartan loathes missing a workout. A Spartan can complete a workout in his grandma’s basement, a hotel room, or in a city park.<br>  <br>  11) If the Spartan is not in pain during his workout, he is wrong.<br>  <br>  12) The Spartan never cheats. He maintains proper technique throughout his training, because he knows that smooth is fast, and that he will be mocked mercilessly for, “girly pull-ups”.<br>  <br>  13) The Spartan knows the value of the basics: the push-up, the pull-up, the chin-up, the sit-up, the squat, and the dead-lift. He also knows the importance of variety, and seeks out different techniques of the above.|`|252a010d4d8fa39c754a2d92eed2ed2baa	It depends. <br>  What hurts your leg muscles or is it your hip joints?<br>  <br>  If your muscles are sore from training it is okay to run.  Actually, you want to keep a regular routine.  Your body will eventually get used to it.  If your muscles are sore, you want to exercise to flush the lactic acid out of your muscles.<br>  <br>  If you feel it's your hip joints that ache, take some rest.  Don't exercise too hard.  <br>  <br>  Muscle sore is a burning feeling on your muscles.  Joint pain is pain in the hips, knees, ankles, shoulder...you know...pain in the joints.<br>  <br>  Hope you can distinguish between these two.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	I would go every other day on your legs/cardio until you get more used to it (which you will and it wont take long, trust me)|`|pJ7icz0taa	YES|`|w7G1FxRFaa	In my opinion u should take  rest....!|`|KbnUq585aa	Lay off til your legs are better;3-5 days, long enough to heal/respond to the usual strain. And don't forget to warm up then stretch; very important. If you don't sleep well, wake tired, start there; anything to relax more and rest better. If they don't improve, you have another problem; ask someone familiar with those exercises and their overall effect on your whole system. Include  your state of diet and hydration; deficits in those can cause many problems, too.|`|DYlsqrMcaa	Yes it is okay. When your body is sore its because your body has released "lactic acid".  Lactic acid is best burned out of your system by exercise.  Lactic acid is what eventually causes knots in your back and joints causing aches, if not burned out of your system over time.|`|Y44ZKI97aa	no. your never supposed to work out on parts of your body that are sore. you HAVE to let your muscles rest. it's very unhealthy if you dont. just rest your aching muslces until they feel back to normal.

6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	sounds like you are writing a story.  what could happen is that there is a knife wound like you describe.  they rush them to the hospital and they have multiple surgeries to repair the intestines and stomach, including the removal of some intestines if needed(my friend had this happen after an accident.)  this will give you a larger span of time to get the multiple surgeries in.  then in the end an infection causes the victim to die.  that would be more plausible.  if you don't want multiple surgeries, you could have the perhaps die outside of the hospital.  <br>  <br>  sorry for lack of capitals, typing with sprained wrist|`|ixmaM395aa	Do you know just how wrong this question is? <br>  <br>  Jeeeeeeeesh, if you were my friend I'd be staying away from you for awhile.... especially if you're holding a knife!|`|KpTZdTcTaa	first of all i think the knife would have had to stab the liver before penetrating the area you just mentioned. so in a way a critical condition is possible although highly unlikely. internal bleeding and stomach rupture is likely to happen.|`|LirTrcZraa	It could happen I guess, but 4 weeks seems excessive, death would likely occur within a few hrs- a few days if this realy happened|`|nYORxiuaaa	I really don't know..|`|bBJXp9oFaa	Seems like ya got this all planned out, eh?
tMtBe1lKaa	Vitamin A is what turns people yellow. It would take A LOT of papaya to do this. He may be getting vitamin A elsewhere also, but it would have had to build up over time to actually become visible. Juice Plus is a supplement that has too mcuh A in it, and turns people yellow. This is a sign of poisoning, and if A continues to build, it can lead to functional problems also. <br>  <br>  Hepatitis or your liver not functioning for whatever reason are also common scenarios that cause people to turn yellow. I would probably seek some medical attention. A simple blood test can narrow down the possibilities here.

I usually eat a meal of what ever I want once a week....controlled portion....this really works.........<br>  <br>  Write down every thing you eat|`|zW5OWgXtaa	Weight Loss Tip #1:<br>  Push in two fruits or vegetables with every meal you eat. This will fill your stomach and help you cut down on the calories you would take in from the other foods.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #2:<br>  Eat breakfast daily. You would have gone hours without eating since the previous night, hence eating breakfast would not decrease your tendency to overeat later during the day.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #3:<br>  Have some snacks every 4 hours. You could have any snack: Oranges, Apples, Chips, String Cheese, Pretzels etc. Eat anything you want (in small quantities), just make sure you have something in your stomach at all times, you shouldn't feel hungry.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #4:<br>  Eat at regular intervals. Eating at odd irregular times would upset your whole diet. It is always advisable to maintain a specific schedule and always stick to it. <br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #5:<br>  Always know your portions: Half a cup of rice is about the size of your fist, one ounce of cheese is as much as a large marble; a three ounce serving of meat is the size of a deck of cards. <br>  Divide your plate into parts: Three fourths of it should be filled with vegetables, grains, beans and fruits while the other quarter should be extra-lean meat or low-fat dairy products.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #6:<br>  NEVER skip your meals. NEVER!<br>  Skipping a meal might seem like cutting on calories but thats not the case. You are basically starving yourself which is very wrong. The next meal that you eat will be converted to pure fat. This will eventually cause you to gain weight rather than losing any.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #7:<br>  Drink A LOT of water. This is one of the most essential components of your diet plan. One glass of water every hour would do wonders to your body. It helps you eat lesser without making you feel hungry. The large amount of water intake also flushes out all the unwanted waste in your body and helps in digestion too. Drink atleast two to three litres of water daily.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #8:<br>  Eat slowly. Munch and chew every bite. Grind it to pieces before swallowing it. Generally when we're in a hurry, we just tend to swallow down whole chunks of food. We do not realise when we're full and when we're overeating. Eating slowly will not only give you satisfaction from every bite but you will also realise when to stop. <br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #9: <br>  Cut 100 calories a day from your diet. Replace your daily bar of chocolate with a banana or an orange. These 100 calories a day sum up to 1 pound a month. Just by giving up that one bar of chocolate, you can lose 1 pound of weight in one month!<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #10:<br>  Buy pre-cut fruits and vegetables. You're more likely to munch on them as a snack or make a salad from them if they're already cut. You might feel lazy on one particular day and decide to wipe those veggies and fruits out for that one single day. However, if they're already cut, you'll feel like eating them. <br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #11:<br>  Go in for the less processed food. Its less fattening. For example: Potatoes versus chips, Whole Wheat Bread versus Doughnuts etc.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #12:<br>  Don't eat on auto-pilot. For example: Tasting the food you are cooking, Noshing from the serving bowl etc.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #13:<br>  Limit your alcohol intake. Limit it to only occasions. Alcohol is not only extremely fattening but also deteriorates your will power. Alcohol is also very harmful for your body in the long run. Try your best to limit your consumption, if not call it to quits.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #14:<br>  Don't do it alone. Get a friend or relative to go on a diet with you. In this way, both of you will inspire and push each other and keep going.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #15:<br>  Eat beans every now and then. Add a handful to your salads to curb your hunger pangs longer.<br>  Sweeten your food with spice. use spices like cinnamon and vanilla to desserts instead of sugar. They're less fattening.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #16:<br>  Keep moving, Don't be a couch potato. Daily physical activity, like walking, along with healthy eating is key to long-term weight-loss success and maintenance. Once again, more is better.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss Tip #17:<br>  Make a strong start, Contrary to common wisdom that "slow and steady wins the race", weight loss is best, recent articles have found that dieters who lost weight quickly, lost more total weight and kept off more weight long-term.

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!  I recommend you give it a shot!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/</a>

The other is Pomegranate Juice extremely high in antioxidants (the best thing out there.)  Buy it pure from a health food section of your grocery store and have 8 ounces every day.  Pomegranate juice is thought to have been actually the apple Eve bit into and not an apple.<br>  Stay on a well balanced diet with whole grains, proteins (good for the brain) in meats and dairy products (eggs, cheese) eat yogurt, butter is better than margarine, but use it sparingly and Olive Oil is the best oil to use when cooking stir fries, etc.  Lots of veggies especially leafy greens such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts as these are good for the colon.  Fruits are excellent and many have antitoxidants in them and others are good for digestion and calming the stomach down and also healthy for the colon.  Drinking 8 - 8 ounce glasses water (on a normal day) is a must to flush out kidneys and keep you hydrated and if you are exercising or the weather is hot then drink more water (your body lets you know when you're thirsty.)  If you are really thirsty this means your body is already dehydrated. <br>  <br>  not getting enough sleep will lower your immune system|`|ahjOfnIIaa	I hate to say it, but I think these "sicknesses" have been self-induced, either that or you've become another victim of the wonderful craptacular ventilation system in schools!!|`|DhR2Lttgaa	It's nothing you can control.

Once you eliminate the fear of having them they will vanish. Also try talking to someone about it, like a doctor. Also stay away from anxiety medications that's a road no one should go down. Another thing is to have many interests that can keep your mind occupied and stress free. Hope this helps! good luck :)

kB4EJUKgaa	That would be my suggestion as well. If there aren't openings at your local hospital, look at ones in surrounding counties and consider moving there. You could also see if doctors offices are hiring LPNs too. I've heard that a lot of places aren't hiring LPNs, just RNs. I know my two local hospitals have about 15 openings each for RNs and maybe 4 for LPNs. Don't give up though! Check everywhere that has job listings. Online, newspapers, anything! Good luck!|`|4onT0qUxaa	Your answer is right in your question. You said you live in a small town with only one hospital, right? So if they aren't hiring, and you really want a hospital job, MOVE! There is a huge shortage of nurses, but if you live in a small town, you are limiting your own options, you have to go where there are more people!!

AA11693263	There is a possibility that you have a mild form of it. My brother has it and his hair is very thick and before he was put on medication he still pulled out enough to have a lot of bald patches. If you do have it, it might be able to be controlled without medication at this point in time. But do go see your doctor about it. If you do have it, it's best to get it under control now while it's still not too bad to cause bald spots. Left untreated it could get worse. Don't be embarrassed to talk to your doctor about it. This is what they are here for. Even if it's embarrassing to you, just think about what the person in the next room could be telling him. It could be much more embarrassing and all you are telling him is you might have a form of OCD.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	I would mention it to your doctor.

Cardio to burn some fat, strength training to build some muscle (which actually burns extra calories througout the day...it basically raises your metabolism), and proper diet (this is actually where the most weight-loss potential is...note that you only burn a few hundred calories every half hour of workout...that's just one candy bar or soda!!!  so, its easy to see why limiting your calorie intake is so important)

UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise.

Nage3N1Faa	yeah its normal..|`|b7vdkAAIaa	your body typically won't allow you to urinate with an erection because urine and semen go down the same path and urine will kill the spermatozoa - so it's an evolutionary precaution<br>  <br>  you ought to avoid trying to pee with an erection|`|YJtJin8Zaa	ofcourse its normal, ur horny mostly every guy is horny all the time  ha ha well i am so dont worry its perfectly normal so dont worry. but its harder to pee when hard but its still normal well i hope that this helped|`|zMD0VeOmaa	sure. if you're erect it's hard to control where the urine goes. I can't bend my penis down very easily when it's erect and urine usually gets all over the place.|`|fixajC2xaa	perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  its actually much harder to piss when your penis is erected.|`|XXbZAriNaa	hard-ons are for c*mming not going|`|NXBmcEz7aa	It is very normal. though at time you can also pee when your penis is hard and erect.  However, you pee more comfortably and with fast flow if your penis is placid.
DtIbz0Kkaa	brown stains are usually jsut blood spots that have dried up ( dried old blood turns brown)... its normal to miss your period... sometimes you may not even know you have bled therefor having those stains on your undies.. i wouldnt worry to much.... sometimes period come darker than the red blood... it jsut could mean you dont feel well.... or your period is a little irregular.. your body could be changing... give it a bit if your still concerned then i suggest seeing a doctor...<br>  <br>  its all alright for now|`|WnygliJfaa	old blood|`|hGEZ0b4Zaa	If you got your first period less than 3 years ago it is probely just an irregular period.

eHmyeLqJaa	i do that i go to the gym but a lot of the times i work out with my friend at his house. since it sound like you just have free weights you should get a resistance band they are amazing they are great way to have a good workout. the only thing about your routine is that you should also include some workouts for the rest of your body like shoulders and back. well i wish you the best of luck.|`|fwpu4jL3aa	Experts recommend that you accumulate one hour of physical activity every day to stay healthy or improve our health. Obviously this is also good if you are trying to lose weight and keeping it off.<br>  <br>  The rule is the more intensive the activity is, the shorter the duration of exercise. As you progress into activity with moderate intensity, you can cut down to 30 minutes a day for four days per week.<br>  <br>  There are 3 types of exercise that your body needs to keep healthy - cardiovascular, flexibility and strength. Cardiovascular activities are those ranging from moderate to vigorous exercises.<br>  <br>  Here are some of the light, moderate and vigorous activities:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008/08/31/lose-weight-by-creating-your-own-exercise-program/" rel="nofollow">http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008...</a>|`|TNLpkLmuaa	you could work on your abs after every workout and depending on what are your goals<br>  if u want to gain some lean muscle then<br>  mon and wed u could jog<br>  tues you could work on back and biceps <br>  thurs on your lower body <br>  fri chest and triceps<br>  or if u want to lose weight then focus more on cardio<br>  mon wed and fri u could jog <br>  tues upper body <br>  thurs lower body|`|OXB8EpDQaa	Hey, tell me what kind of weights you have. I'll come back to the question and answer after that.|`|WlBu8cx2aa	Hey there.<br>  Your plan for mon, wed, fri, tues, thrus is good, but you should do abs every day.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	You're on the right track.<br>  <br>  The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise.

It started coming at the end of the month, then the beginning... now it's coming around the 20th. I think it's changed 3 or 4 times since I started when I was 11. I'm 19 too.|`|c7d8c481e6f31523121ba3235e8e5c6daa	im 15 and I take the same stuff but my doctor said that depending on how long you have taken it you can get your period early.

EIrdLq6Zaa	You're in the perfect range. What you might be doing is very normal for guys to do. We like to compare- admit to it or not. In school when you shower you are probably glancing at the other guys and noticing some bigger than yours. Some bigger some smaller. Guys compare how they measure up- we just do. But there really is nothing wrong with your penis measurements.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	You size is perfectly normal.  Flaccid size doesn't really matter.  The base is on top, where the penis meets the pubic bone.|`|TAiQxo5paa	Everyone is different. Averages posted on sites are just what they are... averages. That just means they collect a bunch of data from different guys and determine what the average size is.|`|AA10327722	the base is the top area where your pubic hair grows and yes thats a normal size.|`|k9IFYBDQaa	everyone is different, don't worry about it!|`|u1Cp6PYKaa	damn thats bigger than mine<br>  <br>  <br>  im 14 too|`|NXBmcEz7aa	At your age, don't worry too much about size.  When you grown up to be a man, you will soon realize that there are more important things than size.  Arts and techniques are more important and more effective than size alone.  Meanwhile, take it easy and keep your cool.  At your age, there other more important things you have to be concerned.
BLD9EEWNaa	I used to do that, especially with people's accents (which sometimes got embarrassing), but I don't know what its called.
XRdOfOn6aa	It can vary. I have no adrenals so I do the same thing. <br>  The first thing is that you can do other things before the crisis - you can take oral steroids if you can keep them down. Fluids, salt and rest will help. <br>  <br>  When I have a crisis, the first thing I feel is a horrible headache and nausea. I also tend to get very confused and cannot make decisions - even simple ones like picking a shirt or food. Vomiting may come soon.<br>  Once I vomit, then I need more steroids right away - so I take more orally, as well as a salt tablet (sodium going down is the crisis trigger BTW) and see how it goes as well as a zofran. Did you doctor give you zofran or phenergan to help you stop vomiting? That is needed. If I can stop, all is well, otherwise, then is when you need the injection.<br>  <br>  Usually the injection is solu-cortef or solu-medrol, which are faster acting corticosteroids. Dex takes a long time to act so that is an unusual choice for an emergency medication.  Do you have an emergency kit together - the medication, needle, alcohol pads, instructions, contact info, letter from doc on how to treat?
Q8m6BGKVaa	I understand your unwillingness to take the medications as psychopharma is more of a guess work than anything else at this point.  Most of these SSRI's work well for a majority of people, but there are like dozens of different serotonin molecules and depending on your specific problems the majority of these medications might not address those.<br>  <br>  I don't know about your psychotherapist, it's difficult to objectively tell who's at fault here or if you're misconceiving things (due to your current mental health?).  Best is to keep on communicating, I'd imagine (and hope) that the professionals would be ethical enough to keep you updated and answer your questions thoroughly.|`|uZ13EhYZaa	why not call back and see if there was some kind of miscommunication etc.?|`|K1UicE7kaa	I have to wonder if the secretary screwed up here? Why don't you see the Nurse Practitioner again...   Just a suggestion: maybe you need both the therapy and the medicine for awhile??  Rather than one or the other...  Since you are out of work... your financial situation will have to be reviewed and new options will have to be considered.<br>  <br>  Whatever health problems are going on... it is just like diabetes, high blood pressure, you can't jump around... you have to be very compliant and stick to the plan for a significant time with modifications that are carefully planned by your healthcare professional.  Sounds like there are many factors and variables... you don't need to add to them making your care more complicated.<br>  <br>  All the problems you mentioned are not quick fixes.  They are complex and feed into each other.  You need someone to make this very simple for you and for you to follow it to the letter. IFyou are out of work... then you have the time if not the money to devote.  Be appreciative and show that by following through to the letter. <br>  <br>  The Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner might be able to direct you to a University Program that has student counselors becoming Social Workers or Nurse Practitioners that can work with you on a fee based on income or no income.  This will be a gift and they will not tolerate you not following the program laid out to you.  If you do your own thing... the resources will go to those that are compliant... that is the way it is for those that have limited finances.  Take your question and all the answers you got... with you to share on your first visit. You can not do this on your own.  No one could.  Get the help you need!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
9ib0tC9Waa	Don't ever take more than 5 grams a day, I would take 2.5 before and 2.5 after. People will tell you to take more but it is physically impossible to use more than that. If you are you are wasting money and probably harming your body. If you take creatine you need to drink about twice as much water as normal or you will have future liver problems.|`|SImSGKEtaa	5 is more than enough. also consider a halfway decent L-glutamine supplement since this amino acid aids in the transport of creatine.<br>  <br>  use a juice drink or something sweet when injesting it to facilitate a decent insulin response too.<br>  <br>  good luck
TAiQxo5paa	It depends on your system, but it should extend it for at least a few minutes longer. However, I probably would recommend "climate controlled" type of condoms. The 2 popular kinds on the market is the "Durex Performax" and "Trojan Extended Pleasure".|`|NXBmcEz7aa	For the first or second time, you may last longer.  But after that, you will soon become so accustomed to it that may be you will  come faster.|`|OZBkd2BDaa	It depends on what sort of cream it is, some can help you go longer but there isn't really a specific minimum or maximum time, its so different with different ppl.... My advice would be to just play with yourself a bit more and learn how to control it a bit more with the muscle you use to stop yourself from peeing (pelvic muscle) when half way through peeing try and you'll understand what I'm talking about. The best way is to just desensitize yourself is to keep doing and try do it more and eventually you won't be as turned on as you have been which will help you go longer.... <br>  Or you could just *** and don't worry about it and then just start again, have more fun, why have one when you can have two or more.....:o)....pj|`|ymqRux3xaa	It's not a race dude. Slow your roll. Pull it out and change positions. At 1:59 change positions again. Think more about pleasing her than pleasing yourself.
omOtAPbsaa	I'd only suggest pulling it if the pressure is getting unbearable. The nail bed isn't meant to be exposed so the longer it can stay on, the better off you are. Doing a bad job of it could easily lead to an infection & then you'd be screwed. Protect it if you can, think about going to the Doc & maybe soak it in warm water, changing the water frequently. Good luck it doesn't sound fun. And yes, it would hurt like a bee-otch if you yanked it.<br>  Rubbing alcohol? WTF? You want to make the guy feel pain? H2O2, ok but not isopropyl|`|EQydFhzmaa	It will grow back. Try and pour hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol over the wound to keep bacteria from getting inside. Once the nail actually falls off, sanitize your toe, and put some Neosporin on it. My toenail was ripped off (it got caught under the door, and then my brother threw the door open), and it grew back. You will be fine.|`|OffM2Ndiaa	It should fall off once a new one grows back underneath.|`|mZ3jta2daa	cut it off don't pull it off|`|IH6Wlmqsaa	Awww that is sick! This question is gonna haunt my dreams. I wish I knew what to tell you, sorry, that sucks.|`|HolCibP8aa	Thanks for sharing.  How bout going to a doctor|`|QUFAKk1paa	watch where ur walking and quit being so clumsy is what u should do|`|9Y04eUIdaa	Exactly the same thing happened to me.<br>  I played badminton using my running shoes (I was just learning how to play the game and didn't want to invest in good shoes unless i really like the game).<br>  My shoes were a snug fit and you need to use shoes a size bigger if you're playing badminton - to avoid stubbed toes, which is exactly what happened to me.<br>  My nail of my big toe turned black.After a week or so, it's like it is going to fall of. Only a little bit of skin kept it in place. I placed Band-Aid over the toenail to keep it in place until my new toenail began growing back. The dead toenail eventually fell off and it really didn't hurt unless something hard pushes against the exposed skin.<br>  My badminton friend (who also had the same experience) told me that unless the base of the nail is damaged (the skin connecting the nail to the toe), the nail will eventually grow back. I think mine grew back in a month.<br>  PS<br>  Since I'm a girl, I also applied nail coloring (dark color) to cover the black toenail. Hehehe!|`|0JnrrwBaaa	drink a bunch of booze maybe shoot up some numbing crap if ur a pussy... tie strink around it then a door... brace urself and then slam the door... that should work... also have a phone on handy and 911 on speed dial...|`|V4LrpBBuaa	It will fall off, so just be careful with it until then.

However, running with a constantly high blood sugar will have effects on your general health and will need to be treated.<br>  I am in an ER myself and the problem we face is that we are not able to start to treat more chronic medical conditions, you do need to see your family Dr for this as you need to access treatment options.<br>  Good luck.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	The reason they treat other people before you in the ER is high blood sugar levels are not what they are meant to deal with the name should give you a clue they deal with EMERGENCIES.

I answered your other question , but you have got to get creative here. DO IT!|`|LaCj6C8Raa	I would establish with a family doctor.  This is BAD.  They don't seem worried about it at the ER, because the people having heart attacks and about to stop breathing from anaphylactic shock are more important than you.  The fact that there are only 6 or 7 people before your tells you that this is a big deal.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	The docs at the ER did not refer you to someone?  They didn't give you medications?  Did they get your sugar to normal before dismissing you?  Go again to the ER at a different hospital and ask to speak to a social worker before you leave?
iK3YYRaTaa	You are a train wreck waiting to happen. I can't believe your Numbers.Its not the Ketones that make excessive foam in urine, its the protein. Which means your kidneys are getting bad . You don't want the pain and suffering of dialysis, do you? you better get with it my friend. Blindness and heart trouble is stalking you. <br>  You did not say which diabetes you have, but I guess it type 2.<br>  <br>  You need a low glycemic index diet and lots of exercise. Quit sitting on the couch eating potato chips and frito's. Get moving now or your life is over as we speak. You need increase of meds. Now not tommorrow. <br>  <br>  Do you want to experience a coma. Or what. 600 is about the number. But I think you might be in one now. Because no normal perdon would neglect himself like this. Also get to a Shrink. You need help. Anti-depressants are in order.

If you have a glucometer to test your sugar how come you aren't on medication?  What does your doctor say about this?  If your numbers are true, then you really need to see a doctor today, and possibly the emergency room at a hospital.  Diabetic ketoacidosis is deadly.  You can fall into a coma and may not come out.  <br>  You can go to the local pharmacy to determine if you have ketones.  You can buy ketone strips without a prescription and all you have to do is pee on the strip.

But your friend is right.........if you put a 50 pound rock on the scale it will tell that it has some fat although we all know rocks don't have fat. The best way to measure fat is to use those fat calipers and actual inches measurements or better yet go to the doctor. I would use the scale only to weigh your weight in pounds.but don't trust the fat reader as you might learn that your are losing weight but the scales says you are getting fatter.|`|4Qx8lGs0aa	Don't trust the scale 100%. My cousin had bought one of those and it showed I was 20% body fat when I was in fact 11% when i checked at the gym.. so they aren't very accurate.

Honestly, I have been using the withdrawal method (with guys I fully trust and have had rel with more than a year) for a very very long time and I have never gotten pregnant. I got pregnant when my partner and I deliberately risked it, and when I was at my most fertile (I was in the middle of my cycle). <br>  <br>  I suggest, just to be 100 percent sure, to go get a morning after pill. Some girls get pregnant VERY EASY, easier than most others. You'll never know if you are one of them. Good luck.|`|W1aBjpRhaa	Yes, because guys pre ejaculate. Which means you can get pregnant.

Numerous published scientific studies have shown that precum contains no sperm. You can find these studies with Google. <br>  And for all the people (and websites) who have been scaring people with horror stories about how precum is "loaded" with sperm and can cause pregnancies, this can now easily be tested and confirmed at home using SpermCheck, a new home sperm test. It works just like a home pregnancy test. Read more about it here: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.contravac.com/products/spermcheck/vasectomy.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.contravac.com/products/spermc...</a> <br>  <br>  It's meant for men to check if the sperm count in their semen has dropped well below the level medically considered safe for unprotected sex after a vasectomy. However, you can also use it to prove that precum is safe too. Just put some precum on the sensor and in about 10 minutes you get a reading. <br>  <br>  Remember that precum can still transmit sexually transmitted diseases, however. So unprotected sex is really only safe if you are sure that neither partner has an STI and the man is very careful to pull his penis all the way out before he starts squirting real sperm-filled ***. Men cannot feel it when they are leaking precum into the vagina ... it only helps make things really nice and slippery! However, men can and do feel when sperm is ejaculated because each ejaculatory pulse or squirt is accompanied by very distinct waves of pleasure in the groin and penis. It's kind of like peeing inside the vagina, only different and far more pleasurable. So unlike with precum, men can clearly feel when semen comes out and they must be sure to pull out before these orgasmic ejaculatory squirts begin. <br>  <br>  The reason precum gets wrongly blamed for pregnancies is that men sometimes lie (or don't tell) when they accidentally (or purposely) don't pull out before enjoying the extreme pleasure of ejaculating real semen where nature intended for it to go! Men have to be both honest and able to control the strong urge to enjoy squirting *** -- even just a squirt or two -- deep inside the vagina. If they lose control, they all too often take their chances and hope they get away with it. And they often do, but eventually somebody will get pregnant this way. Instead they should at least be honest and admit when they shot some real semen inside. That way their partner can at least know to take the morning after pill (aka "Plan B") and they'll be OK to practice perfecting the pull out method another time. Contrary to popular belief, the pull out method is very effective if -- big if -- it is practiced correctly every time.
HXnvvwL8aa	The question you have to ask yourself is do you really want to quit?  The electronic cigarette is not a "quit smoking" device.  It is a smoking alternative.  Now, do you actually "quit" tobacco?  Absolutely.  But do you quit smoking?  Not really.<br>  <br>  About six months ago, I started using my e-cig and still smoking my tobacco.  I cut down from a pack a day to 4-6 smokes.  About a month and a half ago, I woke up and decided I could just use my e-cig.  I have had absolutely no depression, no over eating, none of the "quit" issues.<br>  <br>  Is the e-cig a joke?  Absolutely not.  There are thousands of people who have made the switch and guess what?  They are all tobacco free, still enjoying their smokes, and there is no second hand smoke, so it is better for those around you.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is you do some research.  Look at the different suppliers.  Read more.  Decide what style you want.  Note:  Njoy is just a name brand like Marlboro or Camel.  Read blogs of people who use them.  I love mine.  I could not have gone tobacco free without it.|`|uC75y83Taa	Netta, It's a joke, and you're better off just quitting cold turkey.  Every day I see women find out they're pregnant, so they just stop smoking!<br>  Or I see people hear that they have heart disease or lung cancer, so they quit immediately!<br>  <br>  I quit smoking cold turkey over 20 years ago.  You just need the WILL and the WILLPOWER to quit.<br>  Then you can be proud to say, "I don't smoke."<br>  <br>  Do yourself a big favor!  Bless you and sincere good luck!  :)
33l1SqrRaa	Back Sleepers<br>  <br>  Yes, this is actually the preferred position to sleep because it places the least amount of stress to your spine-IF you:<br>  <br>  Place a cervical roll or rolled-up towel under your neck. Make sure that your head is in a neutral position (that you are neither looking up or down). If you find that you cannot be “in neutral” then you need a smaller roll.<br>  <br>  Place a pillow under your knees-This takes stress off <br>  of your lower back. You could buy a special pillow for this, but a <br>  regular pillow works just fine.<br>  <br>  Try not to sleep on your stomach, as it is the most stress inducing position.|`|E3SJNlIUaa	You should lie on your right side, it helps your circulate air through your body.|`|m3q6CIQMaa	In your case I would probably sleep on my back or side.

F58MyGlsaa	I used it a couple years ago when a condom broke. I didn't get pregnant so I would assume it worked. I know of a few friends that have used it too and it worked. It has a pretty high success rate if its taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The pills work by preventing implantation of the egg. If you are already pregnant (meaning the fertilized egg has already implanted in your uterus) then it won't work.|`|a92aaf69c31f3c24aa6470a18ea029d9aa	It works 99% of the time. Take the first pill now and the second one 12 hours later. Plan B forces you to have a period. This prevents the fertilized egg from implanting. It will also put your cycle out of whack temporarily.|`|sBjTrz4Xaa	Nothing is 100% other than abstinence. However, Plan B works only when implantation has not yet occured. If a pregnancy already exists, then it does not do anything.
cUWQPWjLaa	Do u mean does music therapy help at all? I think so it helps a lot, try it urself, when ur upset listen to some fast songs , when I find it hard to sleep I listen to soft music and it helps me to sleep. When ur sitting idle just listen to music it will help u forget stuff which u usually brood upon during that time. Music therapy definetly helps and best is u can do it at home instead of spending money on a professional.|`|c68XWGltaa	i once threw a guitar at this mentally challenged kid. does that count?
gSo4dR7oaa	More than 98% of people would test positive within 3 months.  In very rare cases, it could take someone up to 6 months to test positive.  You have tested negative 6 months after your exposure, so you are fine.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	it has happened in the past, but it is unlikely, especially 3 x|`|HeB9M5lgaa	They are usually pretty accurate and having the same reading after 3 times makes me just believe more how accurate they are.  The cases of test results getting mixed up happens but not as much as you see on tv. Relax you tested negative 3 times. More than likely your negative.  If you cannot take comfort in that then have it done once more and tested elsewhere. Good luck. Usually you can get a positive reading by 6 months after exposure.|`|JITTMjasaa	I have heard of it not showing up as positive even though it is. It is said to sometimes to take a while. If you don't trust them go to another doc. I have also heard that some people are immune or fight it off better than others. Something I'm sure pharmaceutical companies would pay a lot to keep quiet. No one knows for sure.|`|s1gEHdBgaa	Yes, it's possible, you can get tested in  another  laboratory|`|57Avg06Waa	Yes... nothing's impossible. Go see different people from different laboratories. Like that, you'll get more opinions. But results like this are accurate, so... yeah.|`|0nyWiro9aa	Chances of them lying is slim. That would be fraud. All testing performed in a laboratory must be documented and such documentation is kept for years in order to comply with mandatory inspections. It is not unheard of for inspectors to come in and ask for the laboratory records for a particular patient and quality control performed that day for that test. All instrument printouts are kept all handwritten records are kept. In the case of HIV that would be the optical density readings and the cutoff values along with controls.<br>  <br>  As to the next question of accuracy. All state licensed and federally regulated laboratories must submit to blind sample testing for proficiency examinations. An outside agency sends blind samples and the laboratory must submit results for those samples for grading. If and when they fail such a test then remedial action is needed and retesting occurs and if they fail again then they may can be suspended in performing that test until they provide proof that faults have been corrected.<br>  <br>  There has been fraud in the past concerning laboratory testing in the private outpatient laboratories which is why there are many state and federal agencies overseeing laboratory practices.|`|93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	It is always possible for mix ups to happen as labs are staffed by Humans and Humans do occasionally make mistakes. It would be weird for it to come out with a false negative or the same mix up three times on the same patient though. <br>  <br>  If you are REALLY worried about it then I would send a sample off to a DIFFERENT lab and see if the tests come back with the same result. Also practice safe sex and universal precautions (like gloving up when coming into contact with someone else's body fluids) this can help keep you from catching HIV.|`|iWv7Lt7caa	i dont think they would lie about it<br>  but it is possible for the virus not to show up on a test for even up to a year<br>  <br>  but even with that said...<br>  "the chance of a false-positive identification in a low-prevalence setting is about 1 in 250 000 (95% CI, 1 in 173 000 to 1 in 379 000)"<br>  <br>  so its pretty unlikely.|`|YAS3mwD8aa	No it is not possible. And you are definitely negative. The person saying that it might not show even in an year don't have the slightest idea what they are talking about. You are negative. 3 month test is conclusive.|`|McfrauFnaa	it's doubtful, but i would kinda stay out of the game for awhile just in case. lol who did you hook up with, lmao i'm sorry but wow dude never saw that one coming hahaha|`|uYDoPNv9aa	they probably are accurate. get the test re done.:P

BsMkp3nPaa	when your mucous is an abnormal  green or yellow color, it's a sign. a decongestant may help ease the pressure and headache but may make you drowsy. it will go away on it own even if you don't go to the doctors. i'm a firm believer in don't take antibiotics unless completely necessary because it's making germs harder to get rid of they're becoming resistant to the antibiotics. if you can, i'd tough it out, and use over the counter meds to help ease the discomfort and if it last for more than a few days then go to the doc.|`|LvSyz1Woaa	if when you blow your nose and the mucous is a gross green color than you might. go to the doctors if you have the problem for a while. don't wait too long because if you do have one, the infection will get worse.

Q4ggnG0waa	Young people don't know how to react to bad news. You could give them a little info since you broke the bad news to them anyway. Thyroid cancer has one of the highest cure rates of all cancers. A radioactive iodine pill, surgery to remove and thyroid medications for the rest of your life are small prices to pay for your life.|`|AA10041941	sweetie that is such a big diagnosis for someone your age but even for someone older its a sad diagnosis! So your totally FINE in the way you feel, your friends don't know how to react because they are normal teenagers I would assume just as you were before your diagnosis. It's hard for them I guess to actually grasp how deep this is for you and I am sure if one of them were going thru this they'd feel the same as you do. I know after my mom passed I was so angry at everyone for for not treating their parents good.. I'd be in a store and heard kids being mean to their parents and it just hurt me so bad because I wish I could take it back and have my mom back I would've treated her much better than that kid at the store.. not the same as what you are feeling now but its the same in the way that once something like this happeneds your changed, you always will be.. not that after you get your surgery your gonna feel better but this had made you grow up and mature more and faster than your counterparts.. its normal, though if you feel its affecting you TOO much you could talk to your parents or a counselor, in the end I know you will be ok and back to your teenage self in now time! Good Luck with all your treatments and God Bless ya dear! *hugs*|`|T2UjNRDaaa	It's human nature to take everything for granted.<br>  you've just been shaken by your diagnosis and realised that we shouldn't think as we do. it's not bad, it's reality, but you can't blame your friends for being human.<br>  <br>  most people who have a life-threatening experiance think similar thoughts initially, but gradually slip back in to taking things for granted (myself included). Usually, the only thing that will change a person forever is if they think they know when they will die.<br>  <br>  don't worry. life goes on- just try and enjoy it.|`|qF6WuooPaa	thats good that your getting it removed, maybe you not taking life for granted cuz your could of died. i mean i never thought about death till i was like 17 all my friends in school started to pass away.|`|sdNH56m3aa	I can relate to you. The majority of adolescents feel invincible, it's really natural to feel that way. Most young people aren't first handily experienced with death. It just shows that you are mature thats all. I don't think you should stop being friends with someone for that reason only. You are definitely in no way being stupid though. You can try explaining how you feel to your closest friends. If they can see your point of view I am sure it would change things. Good luck with your surgery you sound really positive about if and thats the best way to go.|`|yzULbPLgaa	Hmm you have a really tough one. You sound older than your 15 years. I don't have cancer but I have felt alone many times. We tend to isolate our selves to protect our selves from getting hurt. You are going through a lot right now. But they haven't had, that you know about, a serious illness. So they will not be able to relate. And life at 15 should be even for you care free. But it isn't for you. And I am really sorry. It breaks my heart to hear your story. I feel for you. I will pray for you. You should pray for you to. Remember you are not alone. Ever.

AE3lv4pRaa	I hate personal home scales. Unless you spend a lot of money on one, they're going to give you a problem.<br>  <br>  Dial scales work on springs. The problem is that tension isn't always the same over time, or under different temperatures, so if the temperature in the room is different, or the scale is old, your weight will be inaccurate. New scales are decent, assuming the temperature and moisture is always the same. But since most dial scales use levers to reduce the amount of weight on internal peices by a ratio of about 1:12, the more weight, the more it will be off. Pretty much your dial scales are off by a percentage rather than a weight. So a percentage of an 8lb weight is less of a discrepency than a percentage of a person. I can't explain that part too well, but its due to the spring inside and the levers.<br>  <br>  A digital scale is the same as a dial scale except for the way it displays the reading. Instead of moving a rack and pinion to display your weight, it triggers an electronic response on a chip. So the spring still does the same thing and offers the same problems. Perhaps a digital scale is a little more accurate because its one less mechanical peice that could fail, but I don't see a drastic reason to choice one over the other, unless you want a big bright number instead of a crude dial reading.<br>  <br>  Also, a scale uses 4 levels to equalize the weight on the spring. So if one lever is higher than the others, it will change the reading. That's why having your scale on a level surface is important. Its also one reason why you would have different readings in different rooms. Also, a bathroom tends to be hot and moist after a shower, which would change the tension in the spring, and would change the reading you get. Scales are a "you get what you pay for" product. If you don't want to buy an expensive one, do what lalathestylist suggested. Weigh yourself at the gym or doctors, and go back immediately and weigh yourself on your own scale. I would suggest moving your scale out of the bathroom so its not all hot and moist sometimes and dry and cold other times. That will definately give you different readings. Well, theoretically ;)|`|MzCL0dzjaa	When you want exact measurements a digital. For the longest durability it'd be dial. I watched it on deconstructed and they took em' apart and literally went through it all.|`|W1aBjpRhaa	That's a hard one. If you get a digital wet, it most likely will not work as well, break or give you the wrong weight. I know people who had a digital scale and then go to the doctor and somehow it was way off. Also, dial scales are the worst, they are a lot of the time wrong compared to digital. A pretty good priced digital scale should work perfect. But the best, is neither, a doctors scale. Ha, but I got with digital [:
AA11693263	With your past health history it wouldn't be a bad idea to go to the doctor. If you haven't already let your parents know what you are going through then you need to tell them right away.

In yoga they gave me a little tea pot looking thing they let you get the water right up there, but you can use a straw too.  <br>  <br>  I didn't care for it (reminded me of getting water up your nose in a pool), but it did clear out my stuffy-ness. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|E3SJNlIUaa	Boil some water, and poor it into a bowl.

nAp688tZaa	I have a degenerative disc in my cervical spine that does cause a significant amount of pain.  The neurosurgeon said there is no need for a surgical intervention at this point and has allowed me to continue my Physical Therapy in hopes that the muscles that surround the spine will be strengthened and be able to hold up the vertebrae and slow/stop the degeneration process.  I have been doing it for nearly four months now and have noticed some lessening in the pain in that area.  has your doctor suggested some PT to see if the muscles in your Thoracic spine can be strengthened and help slow the degeneration?  If not, you should ask for a referral.  The work is hard and can sometimes make it seem like there is more pain, but in the end, the PT does seems to help.  My most recent MRI showed no advancement in the degeneration, so it is working.  My neck pain, however, is complicated by two herniated discs, but since they are not currently in the position to cause spinal cord damage, I continue with the PT and also see a Pain Management doctor.  You may want to seek a 2nd opinion with all of this too.  There is no harm in seeing what another neurosurgeon has to say about the problem, and maybe he can give you some more education, which it seems like you are seeking, in regards to your problem.  Good luck|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Overall, it looks like you have degenerative spinal problems developing.  Degenerative disc disease can result in compression fractures from activities such as lifting a heavy object or jumping down off a step.   You might take the advice for getting a contrast MRI - the most likely culprit causing the pain is the schmorl's node, or the soft tissue surrounding the fracture.    You might also consider asking your doc about medications that slow spinal degeneration - there are a couple of worthwhile prescription and nonprescription meds available.
m3q6CIQMaa	I don't know anyone who can do this, but it is possible to sleep with your eyes open, but mostly people can only do it with their eyes half open.  It is important to know that it isn't truly sleep, more of a half sleep, half deep meditation thing. To do it, you need to be very focused on one object. The key is not thinking, and to let your consciousness flow naturally. Stay in one position, and don't move, fidget, ect. Lastly, it takes a large amount of practice to do this if your body doesn't naturally do it.  It is also important to know sleeping with your eyes open can cause serious damage to your eyes.|`|xnLzfO55aa	I have always been told that I do it, and people have actually thought I was dead for a few seconds at times.

Not all tools are accurate but they do give you an idea of your body fat compositions.<br>  <br>  DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)<br>  <br>  The most accurate way on measuring your body fat is to perform a DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) test. This test is expensive and cost approximately one hundred dollars. However, it is considered to be the gold standard for measuring bone density and bone fat (with a 2-3% margin of error).<br>  <br>  Hydrostatic Weighing<br>  <br>  Another slightly less expensive test is the hydrostatic weighing test. This test works by getting you to sit inside a tank of water and make you blow out air as much as you can. It has a accuracy rate of 97-98% and cost in the range of $25-$50. If you have severe breathing problems it is best to choose other methods because of the amount of breathing exercises you need to perform.<br>  <br>  Bioelectrical Impedance<br>  <br>  This is the most easiest and painless ways to determine your body fat content. It is measured by using an electronic device that shoots signals from foot to foot or hand to hand. If there is a lot of body fat then the signals will travel slower.<br>  <br>  Body Mass Index (BMI)<br>  <br>  The body mass index was invented between 1830 and 1850 by Adolphe Quetelet. It became a popular measurement of a person's fitness because it is simple to calculate and doesn't require expensive equipment. Ever since obesity became prevalent in 1950's and onwards, it widely used by the medical authorities and health insurance companies to compare groups of people.<br>  <br>  The formula used to calculate an individual BMI is to measure body weight divided by the square of their height (using the metric system).|`|227a46c59a45966193316044d4629a9eaa	the best device is the water system. If you want a cheap way with out buying equipment.. Get a sewing tape measure, measure your neck and then measure your waiste at the thickest point. then subtract the neck measurement from the waiste measurement. lets say your neck is 15inches and your waiste is 30inches your body fat is 15percent. This is not exact but it is close. When I was in the Marine Corps that is how they did it.|`|W1aBjpRhaa	Well you can go to a doctors office, nutritionist or even a gym. They all have it and they can do it for you so that you will know. <br>  <br>  I know you can buy a BMI Calculator online, but not sure how well that works or if it could possibly be a scam. But check out your local gym or even a dietitian or a nutritionist [:<br>  <br>  Good luck.
uC75y83Taa	Well, Lynn, (My name too!) I do think you need to talk to a doctor ASAP.  If you're generally a happy person, I don't think you have real depression.  But if you get anxiety/panic attacks, there are excellent meds that will really help you!  Like Elavil or Klonopin. Those would cover everything that's bothering you.  Tell the doctor EVERYTHING.<br>  Start with your regular doctor.  S/He will treat you, or possibly refer you to a specialist.  The outlook for you is very bright. Believe me, Sweetie, you are not alone!  Lynn  :)|`|9HGOxPoEaa	Oh my goodness. I can relate. <br>  Except for the suicide thing. <br>  I myself get upset over little things, i cry uncontrollably, I wont know how to talk to anyone, I feel useless and helpless, and like everything i say and do is wrong and stupid. I feel like giving up and hiding away from the world. <br>  <br>  It's a terrible feeling. I try to blame things on my mom, because she;s recently been getting on my back about things and it's driving me nuts. But once that issue is forgotten about, I still feel like something is bugging me and i just can't pin point it. <br>  <br>  I havent gone to a counceller or anything. But if you think that you should go get antidepressants, you should go to a doctor that can evaluate you to see if you need them. <br>  <br>  I hope things become better for you <br>  <br>  Hugs<br>  Me <br>  xo|`|z91eUdKvaa	Yes I would go see a Dr I have gone through the same thing mine started after having a child the anxiety and panic attacks.

That's one of the symptoms of salmonella poisoning but it would be more severe and wouldn't go away so easily. They can also be stress or diet related. As long as you've been having them you need to see a doctor.
weVAu72Haa	If its your tibia bone (the larger weight bearing bone) that is broken, then you will either need surgery or the full leg cast, which will immobilize both the ankle and knee. X-rays will help them determine the course of treatment. <br>  <br>  Assuming you don't need surgery, and if the swelling isn't too bad, they will cast it in the office. It is wise to wear sweat pants as you won't be able to wear regular pants once your cast is on.|`|KHBYq6Dzaa	your going 2 the doctor 4 a broken leg quit wining u little baby youl be fine!!!!!!|`|DT80y28Maa	full leg cast is the WHOLE leg. <br>  <br>  doctor will inspect the affected area for tenderness, swelling, deformity or an open wound. Plus, you'll need X-rays to definitively diagnosis a fracture, pinpoint the exact location of the break and determine the extent of injury to any adjacent joints. Occasionally, your doctor may also recommend more-detailed images from a computerized tomography (CT) scan, bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.you will usually need to follow up with an orthopedic doctor in about a week. This bone specialist will guide you in further follow-up appointments and rehabilitation as necessary.

eGiLYNlzaa	I would be worred about your liver, but if you function well then I don't think so. Maybe you think you're fine but other people may have a different opinion? You should ask your coworkers or friends if they've noticed a change in you. If you ever consider having a family, they may not like that aspect of you. Maybe you should think about your future. Otherwise, if you're still healthy and it's not affecting you, then i don't think so. But that's my personal opinion.|`|AA11283175	If you have to ask then you may have a problem.

However, if you know a pastor or school social worker or any other adult you can trust go to them for help.  Trying writing in a journal daily to give you somewhere to express your thoughts. Make sure you are getting sunlight, proper rest at night, try to eat a well balanced diet and exercise of on regular basis.  You can also try some therapeutic activities like yoga, drawing, listening to inspirational music, gardening or anything crafty.

niREnx4uaa	I completely understand. Well, maybe not completely but yeah. I get anxious and freak out when I have loads of homework..which is quite frequently. I think hours and hours of homework is a little excessive, but it is required to maintain a good average.<br>  <br>  Make sure you're organized, first of all. Keep your stuff in certain folders, binders, etc. Keep your papers organized so that you won't freak out when you see it all. Try to finish some homework in class if you're allowed and have time.<br>  <br>  Also, take breaks...like, don't do it all at once. Do about an hour's worth right after school, another hour's work before you get ready for bed, and the rest when you're laying in bed..that's what I do. Write down all of your assignments in your agenda book and cross them out as you finish them so that you won't freak out as much :P<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! Good luck :)|`|YKMBnIrFaa	Take your homework and write down the due dates of each piece of homework on a calendar/agenda. Based on when each piece of homework is due, allow a 30 min. - 1 hr. slot for a single piece of homework, doing up to 3 or 4 pieces of homework a day. (ex: Monday- math 1 hr., english 30 min., science 1 hr.) Even if you're not covering all of your classes in one day, it will help to space things out and keep you from becoming bored. After you've blocked out this homework schedule, follow it. <br>  <br>  DON'T think about the entire stack of homework you need to do, but rather focus only on that one section of math you have to do, do it, then move on the next. The more you think about it in little pieces and ignore all the other pieces until it's their turn to be focused on, the less stressed you become. <br>  <br>  It's helpful if you change this schedule weekly to best favor which subject needs the most attention. Also, don't forget to leave some time in between or after doing the homework so that you can relax and allow the work you've done to sink in.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|adfde6a67deb0f4aa6c56b855a2e8f71aa	The worst thing you can do is freak. You need to stay relaxed. Make a plan when you are going to do certain assignments. Time management is key and it will relieve alot of stress. If you get a chance during school to get do some homework take advantage of it. If you don't get an assignment done don't freak out. Be honest with your teacher and communication is key. Talk with your teacher and tell them what happened and what is going on. Sometimes they will grant you breaks or extension on your homework.
JLayHNZCaa	I believe they drug you a bit and you don't even remember the procedure.  Try not to worry.|`|K1UicE7kaa	It is a piece of cake... you didn't say what kind of endoscopic procedure  (EGD, Colon, or Brochoscopy).  They are all done with a flexible fiber-optic tube that can allow the visualization of whatever specific area is going to be looked at. <br>  <br>  The bottom line: you will have sedation and usually they use a medication you will have little if any recall of what happened... most the time the look-see, maybe biopsy is very brief and most say not worth all the anxiety they built up.  The worst part of the whole thing is the waiting for the procedure and the prep... (esp. for the colonoscopy... where you have to follow home instructions to be cleaned out with laxitives/enema so the view will be unobstructed.<br>  <br>  Call the office in the morning... and speak with the nurse so you will not worry all weekend.  You need to be given some patient education so you will understand what to expect and not be nervous.  You will get all kinds of crazy things from the 25 people that respond. Get your information from the source... not John Doe.  If you buy into Aunt Betty's story from 10 yrs ago... you deserve to be a psychological wreck on Monday.<br>  Go to bed and call in the morning!  Have some faith!

He could get into a cool bathtub to cool his body temp down. If his temp is above 102 I would take him to urgent care. When he has the chills provide blankets. Keep him quiet and make him rest. No activity at all. When he gets up tomorrow, give him chicken broth and see how that stays down. He may need sprite to keep his stomach settled, but push liquids coz his body is now dehydrated from the sweating from the fever. That sweating can remove a quart of liquid from his body and that needs to be replaced.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Usually, you'll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).<br>  <br>  These drugs, which treat both influenza A and B, work by deactivating an enzyme the virus needs to grow and spread. If taken soon after you notice symptoms, they may shorten your illness by a day or so. Oseltamivir is an oral medication, but zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and lung disease.<br>  <br>  Both medications can cause side effects, including lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and trouble breathing. They can also lead to the development of antiviral-resistant viruses.<br>  <br>  In November 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the maker of Tamiflu to include a warning that people with the flu, particularly children, may be at increased risk of self-injury and confusion after taking Tamiflu. The FDA recommends that individuals with the flu who take Tamiflu be closely monitored for signs of unusual behavior. Discuss possible side effects with your doctor before starting any antiviral medication.<br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of liquids. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. Drink enough so that your urine is clear or pale yellow.<br>      * Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.<br>      * Try chicken soup. It's not just good for your soul — it really can help relieve flu symptoms by breaking up congestion.<br>      * Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) cautiously, as needed. Remember, pain relievers may make you more comfortable, but they won't make your symptoms go away any faster and may have side effects. Ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers. If taken for a long period or in higher than recommended doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to your liver. Talk to your doctor before giving acetaminophen to children. And don't give aspirin to children or teens because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  These steps can help you stay healthy, even at the height of flu season:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Get an annual flu vaccination. The best time to be vaccinated is October or November. This allows your body time to develop antibodies to the flu virus before peak flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere is usually December through March. However, getting a flu shot later in the flu season may still protect you. It takes up to two weeks to build immunity following a flu shot.<br>  <br>        Keep in mind that the flu vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, especially for older adults, but it can reduce the risk and severity of illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when the match between flu vaccine and circulating strains of flu virus is close, a flu shot is between 70 and 90 percent effective in warding off illness in healthy people under age 65. It is less effective in older adults. Health experts recommend vaccinations for people over 50 because the flu shot may reduce the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalizations and deaths.<br>  <br>        Healthy people ages 2 to 49 alternatively may receive the flu vaccine via a nasal spray called FluMist. It protects against the same strains of influenza that the flu shot does. Like the flu shot, FluMist is given every year. Because FluMist contains live, but weakened, flu viruses, it shouldn't be given to pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and those with chronic illnesses. A study published in 2006 found that FluMist was only between 30 and 57 percent effective in preventing the flu in adults. However, another study in 2006 found that giving nasal spray vaccine to school-age children helped to reduce the spread of flu in the community. And in 2007, researchers compared the effectiveness of FluMist with the flu shot in children ages 6 months to 5 years. The children treated with FluMist experienced about half as many cases of flu as did those treated with the shot. However, FluMist increases the risk of wheezing in this age group — especially in those who already have asthma or recurrent wheezing and in all children under age 2. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore approved FluMist for children older than 2 years who don't have asthma or recurrent wheezing. Consult with your doctor about which form of vaccination may be best for you or your child.<br>  <br>        You can get the flu vaccine from your doctor, at public health centers and many pharmacies. In some areas, flu vaccines are also available at senior or community centers and at supermarkets.<br>      * Wash your

hfDohxp5aa	I've been there.  Always go with someone you feel very secure with at first. You need some security so you don't get that panicked feeling. Take it little steps at a time.   Don't go into large groups.  It is a learned bad habit of isolation, I am one of the most outgoing people alive, but I went thru a season of agoraphobia, it can be over come with people who believe you and don't make fun of you.  But please go with "baby steps" and you will have more success. I wish you the best and you can do it ;)
rpnFxnCQaa	As a general rule, it is good that you see a professional. Sorry, I had to say it :-).<br>  <br>  Well, I can relate to agoraphobia, social anxiety.<br>  <br>  I had panic attacks when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that too(because of side effects). That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. The main key here is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You have to get out of/break that loop. Not only did that cure me - you become your true self again - but I was also extremely surprised to even discover newly built self-confidence. <br>  <br>  You may want to tackle the problem as soon as possible and get out of that loop.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Fq3vo0kOaa	any phobia can be combated by ones mind! <br>  <br>  You have to convince yourself that you don't have the fear that haunts you! <br>  It can be done...

It is a fear of people.  If you have anxiety problems, you probably need medication to get over it.  It is a matter of convincing yourself, little by little that it will be OK.  It is in the mind, just like some people are just afraid of spiders for no reason, our minds play tricks on us.  It is often caused by isolation, which is just staying home by yourself too much for too long and then getting around people seems scary.
lYQDCJgeaa	There are many kinds of HPV. Some can lead to cervical cancer. Others do not.<br>  It's not quite "like a common cold"--but it might not be serious.<br>  You might also jut have some abnormal cells due to irritation from the IUD.<br>  When mine was removed, I needed cryosurgery (application of EXTREME cold) to help my cervix slough off the "bad" cells. That was all.<br>  No problems after that.<br>  A biopsy is a sampling of cells ot determine exactly what is wrong.<br>  It is diagnostic, and it is routine when there are abnormal cells.<br>  <br>  While it is true that it is more likely to get HPV if you have multiple partners, it is not the only way to get it.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor about getting the HPV vaccine.

So basically just wet a cloth (with cold water, even iced water) and place it on the area till the cloth is no longer cold... Do this for the next couple of days!<br>  <br>  No not exfoliate for at least a week....<br>  <br>  Apply either a sorbolene or a cream without any fragrance in it a couple of times a day to keep the area moist... <br>  <br>  Don't wear tight underwear, and cotton is most suitable because it allows the area to breathe...<br>  <br>  After about a week or even two, once the hairs start growing back, apply some tea tree cream or oil, do this every day.  You should be able to start exfoliating now too... This will prevent any ingrown hairs!<br>  <br>  Make sure you speak to the therapist about what happened so she wont do it again!!!!<br>  <br>  All the best

NJEzbr1baa	Inside the back of the eye, is a "jelly", called the vitreous humour/body. As people get older, this jelly starts to shrink and become more liquid like.<br>  <br>  Floaters are normally either bits and pieces that have been in the vitreous since birth (think marmalade/jelly with bits), or debris (from general wear and tear) from the junction where the vitreous lies on the retina. People can notice them as spots, cobwebs, lines...etc...The number of these can vary from person to person. Over time, the brain generally learns to ignore these floaters, although if you have a lot, you may just notice a decrease in the number.<br>  <br>  Flashing lights can be caused by the vitreous tugging a little on the retina as it's pulling away from it. These tend to resemble lightning style flashes, and are generally noticed more in dim light/darkness.<br>  <br>  The process of the vitreous pulling away from the retina and causing floaters (and flashing lights sometimes), is called Posterior Vitreous Detachment (or PVD for short). It's a common condition that doesn't require treatment, and you shouldn't be worried about it. As it's a natural part of the ageing process, everyone tends to get it at some point (and yes, it can occur in young people too - I've seen it in people in their 20's), and most people may never even notice it's happened.<br>  <br>  However sometimes, when the vitreous pulls away, it pulls the retina with it. This is not supposed to happen, and is called a Retinal Detachment (if it just tears the retina, it's called a Retinal Tear). Retinal Detachment (or RD for short) can present just with a new onset or change in flashing lights and/or floaters, although sometimes you can get a dark shadow come over part of your vision (unlike the floaters, that move in the direction you look, this shadow will always stay in the same place, and with either stay the same size or get bigger - it will not shrink).<br>  <br>  Unless you've had a significant drop in vision in that eye associated with the above listed symptoms, it's not possible to say whether you've had a Posterior Vitreous Detachment or a Retinal Detachment. To do this, the back of your eye needs to be examined by an Ophthalmologist for confirmation, preferebly soon after the onset of symptoms, just in case it is a Retinal Detachment, as this qould require surgery to fix, and it's generally a good idea to do it sooner rather than later (though depending on the exact nature, this might not be the case - that would be decided when you were diagnosed).<br>  <br>  Bottom line:<br>  <br>  If you notice a new onset of or change in:<br>  <br>  black floaters (of any description)<br>  lightning style flashing lights<br>  a dark shadow over part of the vision that stays in one place<br>  <br>  (any combination of the 3)<br>  <br>  then you should try and be seen by an ophthalmologist as soon as is reasonably possible (where I work we say 24 hours), for assessment. As the majority of these cases are normally PVD, you should try and not get worked up about these symptoms occurring before being checked out.|`|3iGDZ85xaa	I ahve the same thing..... they are called floaters... if your young then theres no prob but in the future it might be a problem

uAzToWC7aa	once u lose vision u cant get it back. SORRY!!!|`|C1xjupXfaa	Dear<br>  <br>  While removing the tumour, the neursurgeon do not leave any chances of traces of tumour cell, since any remanant tumor cell can grow back and spread to other part of body. The time and extent for tumour growth will be depeding on the type of cancerous cells.<br>  <br>  Since the vision mechnism is quite complex and involve many submodules in the body (eye, optic nerve, optic chaism, and the part of brain which process the signal and so on). Damage to any one component can affect the entire vision.<br>  <br>  I do not know, which part the surgeon operated. So if tumour was in the part where these modules are present, it might be removed in operation to say your fathers life.

6lvKLHNKaa	Hi Natalie. It is common for women to produce bad breath during their period. Hormonal changes make the gums more hospitable to odor causing bacteria.<br>  In addition, prior to period, tiny capillaries which run through the gums become more fragile and tend to burst releasing small quantities of blood into the gums. Bacteria feed on this blood creating odorous volatile sulfur particles.<br>  <br>  If you want to prevent bad breath without blowing a big hole in your pocket then I highly suggested you check out this report for more information Below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b4dcx4" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/b4dcx4</a><br>  <br>  I hope this answer will help you to get rid of your problem.|`|dBPCT41kaa	Make sure you not only brush your teeth, but your tongue really good also.

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, first of all, think of your discipline, really even I have a hard time following my desire to get at least be in normal frame even not to get that sexy. But you know doing something even the littlest modification from your daily routine can make changes,like not using the remote while turning tv channels, like jogging in place when you woke up in the morning and have a count of breathing exercises, do it for a few minutes at first, then try to make it a little longer the next morning....and so on ..until you realized that you are doing some more physical exercises that can be done at home. In a challenge to reach a goal, there is only one way to move:Forward...so definitely think that you can do it. First, give yourself time, it took you a while to put on weight, and it will take time to make it go away. Second, get your body moving, but do it gently and easily. Exercise will do wonders for your body and for your emotional state. Third, don't let the popular culture decide what you should look like. You make the decision and then stick with the nutritional plan that works best for you. Fourth, know the balanced diet. Eat 3 meals a day instead of frequent ones or eating between meals. Have at least 4 to 5 hrs. interval between meals for digestion to be efficient. Eat fresh fruits instead of rich desserts. eat at least one serving of dark green leafy vegetables a day.<br>  Remember: You've got to go through it to get to it....good luck|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

What I try to do to keep my weight down is to buy food that is healthy and actually eat it instead of eatting the junk that's around. Oh yeah, there's lots of junk food in my house, but it makes me feel good when I say, "Bread, I'm not going to eat you because you make me fat!" I try to have fun with the concept that the food is like an evil entity that's trying to take over my body and soul, and I will just not let that happen because I am stronger and better than the evil spirit that lives in the bread. lol. Try to have fun with dieting and it won't seem so bad. Also to really answer your question. What motivates me to lose weight is I want to be able to feel as light as I use to be when I danced in dancing school. I took ballet, tap, and jazz in my younger years and loved the feeling of floating in the air as I did jumps, and loved the feeling of being able to glide around, bend, and stretch my body in all different ways without getting out of breath or being in pain. That's what I miss and that's what motivates me when I think about stuffing my face. Hope this helped. Good Luck and be stronger than the food! Just please don't go anorexic! :)|`|BpKY7o6Paa	take a good look at your life style. are you active? how many calories do you take in per day? how many do you burn? these are good questions to ask and find out because they will help you determine just how much you will have to do. i.e you take in 3,000 calories/ day but only burn 1,100 you will not lose weight even if you are exercising a little. After you figure this out find a workout that you like that will burn more calories than you take in, while also finding a creative way to cut out a lot of the un needed calories. stay consistent and make it a lifestyle change and it will happen. good luck. if you want it bad enough you can do anything.|`|D100ixUgaa	How come you asked the same question twice in a row? You're not going to get any answers besides "diet and exercise," because that is THE answer. Anyone who says differently is trying to scam you.<br>  <br>  Happyjello has some good advice, and the people who've answered your other question have good advice. Don't think about your extra weight. Instead, think about the changes you can make to live a healthier life. Get involved in sports, every season, and get in the habit of walking or biking places. Go swimming in the summer, skateboard, go sledding, play dance dance revolution, whatever. If you're using your body, you're exercising, even if you're having fun. Exercise doesn't have to be a chore. Then, eat healthy (this can be hard if your parent don't eat healthy, but just eat small portions if you have to eat unhealthy food), give up soda and candy, and drink lots of water, and the weight will come off. It's not going to happen overnight, but if you lead a healthy lifestyle for one school year, and then look in the mirror, I'll bet you'll see a big difference. Seriously, even if you make a promise to yourself to drink nothing but water for one school year, you would probably lose some weight. So start with that, and work on getting involved with sports and learning about healthy food. Good luck!

38be92b202d3bb88fe3754d7ae6e8ac2aa	Well I think it is a big possibility you have depression. But tests online aren't always accurate. I mean, depression can always be mistake for regular mood swings in teens. And only professionals can truly diagnose you for depression or any mental illness like it.<br>  <br>  But you have been depressed for what seems like a long time. Though I'm not sure your age. I think you need to talk to somebody. Your relationship with your mom seems like a major contributor to your depression. And I understand how you feel there. If you want to talk go to my page and my e-mail address is there.<br>  <br>  When you go to school tomorrow, you should try to find a counselor, or tell a close teacher or adult how you are feeling. They can help you find someone to talk to in school. But I think if you really want to feel a bit happier. You are going to need to talk to your mother. If she loves you and you truly open up and tell her how you are feeling, things between you should change and she will want to help. If she doesn't believe you, then just keep talking to a counselor at school and they will help and probably convince your mom you are depressed.<br>  <br>  But please, if you are feeling down and need someone to talk to just e-mail me. Good luck.|`|zSQD2Jb1aa	its ok calm down<br>  well if youre sad for more than 10 days in a row at a time then you definately may have it<br>  i was like you for years until i met someone who changed my life<br>  he opened new doors but most importantly he introduced me to God<br>  You may feel alone<br>  and you may feel like the world wouldnt care if you were gone<br>  but people like your family and friends would care, even though they dont show it<br>  I used to cut myself and i felt like i didnt belong and that i should just disappear but<br>  praying to God really helped and i dont feel it much anymore<br>  God is there for you even if you dont think he is<br>  good luck
RWD8xMTfaa	Do you have a Zeno?  If so use that but not too much, I've burned my skin before.  I like Burts Bees salycilic acid roller ball (Walmart) it helps.  If nothing helps, pop a few asprin for swelling and go see a derm to get a cortisone shot, just be careful sometimes it can cause depressed scarring unless used correctly.  When I have a bad one I go to the derm and get it zapped with IPL (intense pulsed light photofacial).  Just don't over dry it because then even when it's gone you will peel forever.  I bet you see itmore than other people do, I know how you feel I've suffered with this for a very long time.  Use Clinique concealer, it's the best.  It will go away, don't worry too much.|`|8h8KkcVfaa	First of all, having bangs is not a good adea if you have an acne problem, the oil from your hair gets on your face and only causes more pimples. you should try to bobby pin your bangs back as often as possible and wash your face every moring and before you go to sleep. you don't really need to use anything to make your pimple go away, if you keep touching it and irritating it, it will only get worse and you will be left with scars. to get rid of hard to pop pimples try using a needle to poke a tiny hole in the pimple so you can sqeeze out all the puss. keep squeezing until a tiny drop of blood shows, I know it sounds painful but it's actually not! In a few days your pimple will be gone. It works for me.|`|JFgf7EuBaa	try to go to a dermotoligist and ask them for TAZORAC, gel type. And if you can put a little dab on your face and it should clear up your acne in like a day. Although the stuff is really strong and will make your face turn red if you use it too often. <br>  <br>  Another thing is avoid touching it or washing it too much because then it will just dry.|`|l2elmBt2aa	You most likely have either a nodule acne bump. Nodular acne consists of acne spots which are much larger, can be quite painful and can sometimes last for months. Nodules are large, hard bumps under the skin's surface. Scarring is common. Unresolved nodules can sometimes leave an impaction behind, which can flare again and again. Absolutely do not attempt to squeeze such a lesion. You may cause severe trauma to the skin and the lesion may last for months longer than it normally would. Dermatologists often have ways of lessening swelling and preventing scarring.<br>  <br>  Or you could have a Cyst. An acne cyst can appear similar to a nodule, but is pus-filled, and has been described as having a diameter of 5mm or more across. They can be painful. Again, scarring is common with cystic acne. Squeezing an acne cyst may cause a deeper infection and more painful inflammation which will last much longer than if you had left it alone. Dermatologists often have ways of lessening swelling and preventing scarring.<br>  <br>  But for you right now, the best at home remedy by dermatologist said is to NOT touch but mix about a 1/4 cup milk with brown sugar and one egg. stir. These will not mix. Then bring the bowl by your sink. Close you eyes and GENTELY massage the mixture in small handfulls all over your face until it's all gone. Then put an oil free lotion on your face to prevent your pores from producing too much oil. This a dry part of the year which causes uncommon breakouts. <br>  <br>  Good Luck. (Try Clinique's Acne Cover Up- Liquid Form- it lasts for a long time and seems to stick on anything)|`|FeRC5jkoaa	The only thing i can think of is exfoliating it with a face cleanser, then  wetting a cloth with hot water and soaking it and slowly popping it and then put toothpaste on it.

I would suggest going to a dermatologist asap so they can give you a benzoyl peroxide shot on the pimple and then it will reduce almost immediately or overnite. Just DO NOT touch. And also ask for a sample of Retin A and rub it on at night. This will work..drink lots or water and try not to stress about it because stressing will not help.|`|OleVPkJgaa	make-up|`|OdDJv5ouaa	Try Noxema. Use that twice a day.|`|kTZevQNHaa	It's turning into a BOIL...You can pop it but you have to take a pin that's been heated first in a flame such as a lighter to sterilize it......push really hard though the tough skin just where the bottom of the boil meets the rest of your face...and the pin initially have resistance and there will be a bit of blood but then--with enough steady pressure, the pin will suddenly give way with no resistance--into the nucleus of that horrible boil...and then squeeze it over and over in all directions so you get all the pus out...THEN, put hydrogen peroxide on it (it will foam as the peroxide eats the infection)...and then dry it off...go to the drug store and get Polysporin antibiotic ointment (it costs under ten bucks) and the ointment will speed the healing considerably.<br>  In the morning, you may find the infection has built up again..repeat the draining process via squeezing. wash the area with soap. Then dry it and out the ointment on the area 3 times a day. Should be healed within a couple days.

qIM2LtVzaa	I would try protein shakes, look at local gnc stores and online, sorry I don't really have a web site for you. As far as the steroids, I would just stay away from those because they can cause heart failure and Other potentially harmful reactions with your body, and your right, they wont shrink your penis but its been proven that they can shrink your nuts, sorry. good luck with your search though.|`|xqtKODvbaa	well if you don't want other peoples opinions, don't post your questions online and go talk to your doctor. Simple as that (meaning, if you don't want to get burned, don't play with fire)<br>  <br>  Yes, steroids do not shrink your penis, but since you're body is receiving its testosterone from a foreign source, there's no need for your testes to produce it, therefore they will shrink. Secondly, because your testes are producing less natural testosterone, you will experience erectile dysfunction. Obviously your penis will look smaller if your leg muscles gain girth.<br>  Now, why do you want to use steroids? they are known and have been clearly shown to cause ED (as stated b4), roid rage, body acne, heart conditions, death, and malignant cancerous tumors. So yes your body might look good, but inside it's a ravaging mess and what's the point of having big muscles if later in life you'll be having numerous cancers?<br>  The only people I know who defend the use of steroids are bodybuilders themselves, and because unfortunately they focus most of their time on working out, and not getting an education, they are what we call meatheads, because they are in fact stupid, and live in denial.|`|ltrC7CUAaa	Your cajones are gonna get small. Your balls tell your body, "this body has its own way of producing testosterones so I shoud just leave".

Ohhhh, also, "Last time I checked this was yahoo answers not yahoo opinions". The name is yahoo answeres, I answered and you "asked". Last time I checked this was yahoo answeres not yahoo ask.

Oq5a5hRhaa	It's a part of blood type. Part of your blood type is A, B, AB, or O, and another part is + or -. The + or - part tells you if you are RH positive or RH negative.<br>  <br>  It only really matters if you are giving or receiving blood, or if you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  People who are RH negative tend to have an immune system reaction when RH positive blood is introduced into their system. This basically means that the RH negative person's body recognizes the RH positive blood as an invader.<br>  <br>  If an RH negative woman is pregnant, there is a chance that the baby she is carrying is RH positive. If this is the case, the baby's RH positive blood can enter the mother's bloodstream, which will cause her immune system to learn how to respond to it. The first baby an RH negative mother has is usually okay. However, if the woman becomes pregnant again with a second child, the woman's immune system has learned to destroy RH positive blood, and when the mother's blood enters the baby, it will attempt to destroy the baby's blood, which usually results in the baby having health problems, or even dying.<br>  <br>  However, your friend does not have to worry about anything. Assuming that she lives somewhere where she can access modern medical care, her doctor will simply give her a shot that will stop her immune system from learning RH positive blood, and therefore prevent her body from attacking the baby in a future pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Note that if the baby's father is also RH negative, she does not have to get the shot. (Which is US Pregnancy Category C--meaning its unknown if it causes harm to the child.) A child conceived by two RH negative people will always be RH negative.|`|c7d8c481e6f31523121ba3235e8e5c6daa	um..

Lor20kXcaa	Researchers are learning how to predict a person's odds of getting diabetes.  For example, most whites with type 1 diabetes have genes called HLA-DR3 or HLA-DR4. <br>  <br>  If you and your child are white and share these genes, your child's risk is higher.  (Suspect genes in other ethnic groups are less well studied. The HLA-DR7 gene may put African Americans at risk, and the HLA-DR9 gene may put Japanese at risk.) <br>  <br>  It's not as easy as a chromosomee gone wrong inheritance sorry. !!<br>  <br>  It's extremely complicated, with many genes involved depending on race, we think.

9f0d4ae0f51023b5550419eeaad3fc87aa	I used to have awful cramping and very heavy periods until I went on Mirena. I had minor cramping the first few months after insertion and I barely notice my period now. IUDs are great for people who forget to take their pills.

Since switching to Mirena I've lost 10lbs.  <br>  <br>  I definitely recommend IUDs to anyone who's willing to give them a try. Just be sure to check with your insurance to see if they'll cover it.

The insertion of an IUD can result in cervicitis (swollen red cervix) that only a doctor will notice when examining a patient with a speculum. Very bad history with the Dalkon Shield model. The U.S. virtually banned IUD's after that because of insurance issues. Today, there are two models,one is the copper T380A device (ParaGard, OrthoMcNeil Pharmaceutical Corp) which was approved by the FDA in 1984. The other is Mirena (the levonorgestrel-intrauterine system) which was approved by the FDA in December 2000. <br>  IUD insertion requires the utmost skill and sensitivity by an experienced gynecologist. Easy enough to removed though since the gyno simpy pulls on the string.<br>  <br>  There are numerous risks and side effects of IUD's which are too numerous for me to type out here. I am leaving my book info in the source section. I suggest that you do alot of reasearch. You can even go to any pharmacy and they should have a patient information sheet for the product that you are thinking about. Look at all of your options to find the best for you.

I feel since the cancer has spread, they will suggest the chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.<br>  <br>  Chemotherapy is bit costly and has side effects, such as hormonal imbalance in body, darkening of skin, complete hair loss and so on. Most of these side-effect are temporary and with time each and every thing will be normal. Advantage of chemotherapy is that it clear the body from any remanant cancer cells. <br>  <br>  Radiotherapy too has some side effect but the overall effect of the treatment is positive. It improves the quality of life and expectancy.<br>  <br>  there are many good cancer hospitals for cancer treatment in India such as Tata memorial hospital, mumbai, CMC vellore, Kailash cancer Hospital, goraj, vadodara, AIIMS delhi and so on.<br>  <br>  Be strong.|`|XTepTcoCaa	Liver Cancer - Diagnosis, Causes, Symptoms,treatment And Prognosis.<br>   Liver cancer also known as primary or metastatic hepatic carcinoma is a fairly rare form of cancer in the western world (1% of all cancers) but much more common in Africa and parts of Asia (10% to 50% of all cancers). It is much more prevalent in men and incidence increases with age. Liver cancer is rapidly fatal, usually within 6 months from gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic failure or metastasis.<br>   <br>   TYPES OF LIVE CANCER<br>   Most primary liver tumors are known as hepatomas (hepatocellular carcinoma and primary lower cell carcinoma). Some primary liver cancers originate in the bile duct and these are known as cholangiomas. Some rare liver cancers include Kupffer cell sarcoma and hepatoblastomas (which occur almost exclusively in children and are usually respectable and curable). Metastatic liver cancer is 20 times more common than primary liver cancer and after cirrhosis this is the leading form of liver related death.<br>   <br>   <br>    <br>     SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS<br>   Liver cancer does not normally cause symptoms until it is in an advanced stage.<br>   Clinical effects of advanced liver cancers include:<br>   1.A mass in the right upper side.<br>   2.Tender, nodular liver on palpation<br>   3.Severe pain in the epigastrium or upper right side<br>   4.Weight loss, anorexia, weakness, fever<br>   5.Occasional jaundice or ascites (fluid in the abdomen)<br>   <br>   CAUSOF LIVER CANCER<br>   The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown in adults but in children it may be a genetic disease. Adult liver carcinomas may result from environmental exposure to carcinogens such as mold, contrast media (no longer in use), androgens and oral estrogens, the hepatitis B virus or by damage to the liver due to cirrhosis caused by too much prolonged imbibing of alcohol.<br>   <br>   DIAGNOSIS<br>   Liver cancer is difficult to diagnose in the presence of cirrhosis, but several tests can help identify it: The combination of an imaging study (ultrasound, CT, or MRI scans) and an elevated blood level of alpha-fetoprotein will most effectively diagnose liver cancer, electrolyte studies may indicate increased sodium retention, a liver biopsy can make a definitive diagnosis.<br>   <br>   TREATMENT<br>   Treatments for primary liver cancer depend on the extent (stage) of the disease, age, overall health, feelings and personal preferences. Surgery is the most effective treatment for primary liver cancer, but this is not always possible due to the size or position of the tumor. Radiofrequency ablation is an option for people with small, unresectable hepatocellular tumors and for some types of metastatic liver cancers. During this procedure, the hepatic artery (the artery from which liver cancers derive their blood supply) is blocked, and chemotherapy drugs are injected between the blockage and the liver. Cryoablation may be an option for people with inoperable primary and metastatic liver cancers. Removing the whole liver and replacing it with a liver from another person is another possible form of treatment for primary liver cancer.<br>   <br>   Even when treatments fail to provide much improvement in the liver cancer itself, pain and other signs and symptoms caused by liver cancer can be aggressively treated to improve quality of life. In general, the treatments available for children are the same as for adults, and the best approach depends on the stage and type of cancer as well as the child's age and overall health.<br>   <br>   PROGNOSIS<br>   Prognosis is poor when cancer is advanced, but for small tumors that are confined to the liver, ablative therapies are palliative and surgical resection or liver transplantation is sometimes curative.<br>   By: Dick Aronson<br>   Other Blog Review

VWNiOxcvaa	The question should be "Why do eye exercises have anything to do with natural perfect eyesight?"<br>  <br>  Most people who talk about eye exercises are coming from the premise that we have blurry vision because our eye muscles are weak and need to be strengthened. Eye exercises(eye pushups, eye aerobics, eye yoga) are supposed to strenthen the eye muscles and improve focus and function. <br>  <br>  In one of the eye exercises the person is supposed to look as far as they can to the side or up or down or in all the directions of a circle without moving their head. This supposedly stretches and strengthens the orbital eye muscles. In another eye exercise a person is supposed to look at the tip of a pen or pencil and move it around, back and forth, side to side, an up and down. This supposedly strengthens the muscles of focusing.<br>  <br>  Most people with blurry vision complain of eyestrain and other tension. This is more indicative of overuse or incorrect use than weak or lazy eye muscles.<br>  <br>  Many people confuse self healing activities with eye exercises/drills. Palming, Closed Eyelid Sunning, Swinging, etc., are self healing activities that are very beneficial when done with a knowledge of the principles of natural perfect eyesight. When done without the principles their benefits are only temporary at best.<br>  <br>  Eye exercises are like trying to get better at Basketball by going to the gym and lifting weights for twenty minutes a day. In order to get better at basketball we have to practice the principles of basketball and apply them on the court.<br>  <br>  These exercises were some people's attempt to copy the Bates Method of natural eyesight improvement and its success without asking Bates or natural eyesight improvement teachers how it worked. Optometry likes to reference eye exercises because they don't work and often patients will not question the possibility of natural perfect eyesight any further.<br>  <br>  Natural perfect eyesight is about the principles of how we use our eyes all the time. Most people can return to natural perfect eyesight by unlearning the incorrect vision habits of staring and diffusion, reintegrating the correct vision behaviors of movement and reconnection, and undoing the damage that comes from blur and artificial corrections.|`|4HvuxHPoaa	For me i was going to take the driving test so i could get my permit and i barly passed the eye exam. I've been doing an eye excersise called 'palming' and my eyes are soooo much better.|`|F1OIGwtBaa	The muscles around the eye has little, if anything, to do with eyesight. And we can't 'train' the eye through exercises to do what it is not physically capable of doing. There are several factors that can effect vision: genes, long term exposure to harsh lighting, pH balance, cholesterol levels, and vascular health are just a few. And none of these can be changes through even the most advanced exercises.<br>  <br>  Vascular health (part of age-related degeneration) can have a lot to do with a person's eyesight. As we age, our veins tend to get less pliable. Another degradation of the vascular wall can be caused by chronic inflammation -so slight that it's undetectable - yet can still cause the vascular walls to slightly thicken. Add to this the tendency of protein matter (arterial plaque, platelets, etc) to build inside the veins as we age, and the slightly thickened, less pliable veins around the eyeball loss their integrity and eyesight diminishes. The veins around the eyes are extremely tiny - it doesn't take much to effect the blood flow to the eyes.<br>  One thing that may help is to boost your digestion of protein matter by adding protease (enzyme that digests protein) to your diet. This will help to digest built-up matter throughout your vascular system and intestines. I get mine at vitacost.com for very reasonable prices. <br>  <br>  The body's pH balance can cause normal matter in the blood to become 'sticky' and build up in vascular walls. Alkalizing your diet can be very beneficial to eyesight. There are many websites that talk about alkalizing your body. The health benefits of doing so go far beyond the health of your eyes.<br>  <br>  <br>  If cholesterol is an issue for you, there's a natural product called 'red yeast rice' that has helped many people lower their cholesterol. Not too expensive. Polycosinol is also beneficial, but costs more.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

To go to sleep at night we need to be relaxed and have nothing on our minds.<br>  <br>  You could try preparing an hour before bed by maybe having a glass of warm milk, taking a long relaxing bath, laying quietly in bed and quietly reading a book.  Or any other things that you find relaxing, even boring which should send your brain off into a snooze!  We all need quiet relaxing time to prepare the body and brain for sleep.  Try to "let go" of anything that is bothering you or too stimulating for your mind.  Lay quietly in a dimly lit bedroom, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths and just let yourself drift.  Try this little routine, or something similar for a week or so, and see what happens.  If it persists, you may need to see a doctor.  If you have problems on the brain at sleep time, a theripist can help sort out things so you can get them out of your brain.  But chances are you just need to "unwind" completely before bed...best wishes..|`|6tIFbyADaa	you sleep along ya with your husband|`|O0fPGlm8aa	drink. that helps me
mqXyDTwwaa	Cleansing diets don't help you lose weight, don't rid your body of toxins, and do a lot of other undesirable things. I would recommend that you don't do it.<br>  <br>  "Most people who do detox regimens speak of them with the zeal of religious converts. They can’t wait to detox again. But medical professionals urge caution. They say detox diets can be extreme and potentially dangerous. They also say there’s no evidence that these diets do any good.<br>  <br>  “The idea that foods are poisonous, or that we need detoxification, or a cleansing regimen to improve our health is without scientific merit,” says Roger Clemens, a nutritional biochemist at the School of Pharmacy at the University of Southern California. “We have wonderful organs, great enzymes, a great system for eliminating toxins naturally.”<br>  <br>  "MOST SCIENTISTS SAY there is no evidence to support the notion that these often extreme cleansing methods do anything except perhaps dehydrate you and throw off your electrolyte balance. When people do the regimens to excess, they can get muscle cramps or pass out, sometimes even push their kidneys to begin to shut down.<br>  <br>  “It is fraud,” Cedar-Sinai’s Pressman says. “It is a distortion and misapplication of science and medicine. Kidneys and livers don’t need rest. They don’t need water in huge quantities. What they need is to be used. Our body’s own capacity to detoxify itself is beyond anything we can design.”|`|2ZoP0lZeaa	Hey, I recommend that you try Hypnotherapy!<br>  No, I'm not kidding you on this.  I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!  I recommend you give it a shot!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/</a>
vfhKkiSKaa	Hair follicle tests are usually a 90 day test.  Which means they usually cut the piece by your scalp and test a size that is about 90 days of growth.  If you have taken any types of drugs in the last 90 days it will show up on the test.|`|mx3YK5rLaa	Yup, heroin to!|`|5RZ5tfRYaa	Answer: Yes.<br>  <br>  The hair drug tests are not "follicle" tests; they test strands of your hair (head OR body) 1.5 inches long for drug metabolite residue inside the cuticles of your hair. They take a sample about the diameter of a pencil. <br>  If you have less than 1.5 inches of hair on your head, they'll take it from your armpits, chest, back, legs, or pubic hair. Your body hair grows slower and thus has more concentrated levels of drug metabolites, potentially going back FURTHER than the 90-day maximum.<br>  <br>  Your hair grows at approximately .5" / month, so that's why they take 1.5" -- it offers 90 days worth of available testing. <br>  <br>  It's actually easier for them to detect opiates in the hair than THC metabolites. Your heroin hair will test positive even with very little use, for the full 90 days.|`|b3siaT7Kaa	yes!
SJx9IWWtaa	We DO have programs to help people lose weight.  Its called things like weight watchers, Nutri-system, Nutritionists, THE GYM.   <br>  <br>  Well, America is a democracy, and one the government shouldn't have a lot of involvement in.  So taxing or fining people is out of the question.  And seeing as people have the freedom to make choices, and they chose to be fat!   There are plenty of resources available to them, they just choose not to use them.  Its not our job to nag everyone in America to get out and exercise.  <br>  <br>  I do however think we should not accommodate for people being overweight.

Cells go through a series of changes before they turn into cancer. A Pap smear can show if your cells are going through these changes long before you actually have cancer.

In Graves' ophthalmopathy, your eyeball bulges out past its protective orbit (exophthalmos). This occurs as tissues and muscles behind your eye swell and cause your eyeball to move forward. Because your eye is so far forward, the front surface of your eye can become dry. Cigarette smokers with Graves' disease are more likely to have eye problems.<br>  <br>  Graves' ophthalmopathy may cause these mild signs and symptoms:<br>  <br>  Excess tearing and sensation of grit or sand in either or both eyes <br>  Reddened or inflamed eyes <br>  Widening of the space between your eyelids <br>  Swelling of the lids and tissues around the eyes <br>  Light sensitivity <br>  Less often, Graves' ophthalmopathy can produce these signs and symptoms:<br>  <br>  Ulcers on the cornea <br>  Double vision <br>  Limited eye movements <br>  Blurred or reduced vision <br>  Graves' dermopathy<br>  An uncommon sign of Graves' disease is reddening and swelling of the skin, often on your shins and on the top of your feet, called Graves' dermopathy.

HxXduL1maa	The 69 position, so-named for the two bodies’ positions relative to each other – resembling a 6 and a 9, is a mutual oral sex position. <br>  HOW TO DO IT: <br>  <br>  One person lies down. The other person will turn into a position with their feet toward the other person’s head, and their head toward the first person’s feet, and get into a position on top of the first person, such that their face is directly over the naughty bits of the person lying down. From that point, the two people perform oral sex upon each other. Typically, the person on top is on his/her knees and elbows, though some do it with the person on top literally resting on top of the bottom person. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>     <br>  <br>  When 69 involves a guy and a girl, generally, the guy is on the bottom. This allows the girl to go down on the guy, and remain in control of how deep she takes the guy’s **** into her mouth. If the guy is on top, it is harder for him to concentrate on how far into her mouth he’s pushing his **** if he’s the one doing the movement. This can be dangerous because if he pushes too far into the back of her throat, there can be negative consequences! Of course, it is possible for the girl to be responsible for all of the movement required for the oral sex even if the guy is on top, though it is a little harder to do than if she were on top. Allowing the guy to *** in your mouth in this position allows for the *** to go right down the hatch as well! <br>  <br>  It is possible for the two partners to insert their fingers into the orifices of the other (vaginal or anal) in this position, though it is much easier for the one on the bottom to do so than for the one on top. One of my favorite things to do when someone is on top of me is to wrap my arms under and around their legs to play with their asshole while I am performing oral on them. This can be done by the person on top as well, but it is just a little harder to do. <br>  <br>  One variant for this is for the person on top (the girl, usually) can lift herself up and basically assume a position of sitting on the bottom’s face. <br>  <br>  Another variant is for the two people to be lying on their sides, with one leg raised, bent at the knee, and foot on the bed (or w/e). This will allow for easier access by both people. You can prevent the neck from tiring by resting your head on the other person’s thigh. <br>  <br>  PROS: <br>  <br>  Orgasm contests – see who can make the other one *** first!  <br>  <br>  CONS: <br>  <br>  Doesn’t work well for couples who are not of reasonably similar heights. <br>  <br>  For some people, having to focus on pleasing the other prevents them from enjoying the attention they are getting! It is practical, however, for one person to bring the other one off, and then allow the roles to reverse. <br>  <br>  OTHER INFO: <br>  <br>  If you’re into eating *** (rimming, etc.), the person on top (guy or girl) can assume the “sitting on the face” position and the bottom can lavish attention upon the top’s anal region. <br>  <br>  The bottom can make things easier on their neck if they find a small pillow or something to put under their head to help hold their head up a little while performing oral. This will make it easier on the neck muscles.|`|mi3iB1gsaa	It should be noted that this position only works well if both partners are of similar height. I have tried this with a girl about 1 foot shorter than myself with not great results.|`|cWuumdy7aa	The 69 Sex Position is considered one of the best oral intercourse positions as it allows both partners to stimulate each other at the same time. Since the smaller partner may not enjoy having a substantially larger partner on top, in the standard form of 69, This will give both partners a enjoyment which will make reach orgasm faster for women
SZdVYrSSaa	1.) How would your life change?<br>  <br>  I would likely be less likely to pursue my career (Even though I have degrees from Yale and Georgetown, I am currently working on a professional career in film acting and writing, but if Hollywood and New York were under attack, there would be no way to continue with this) <br>  <br>  2.) What would you do?<br>  <br>  I would likely make one of three choices. I may take my things, pack them up, and leave for safety in another land. I speak some German and fluent French and learned to command a very authentic Cockney British accent, and I would easily be able to pass as a French, English, or Canadian citizen. There is also the possibility that I would move to a very rural area of the states that would not be in jeopardy of targeted attacks. I have enough money to get myself comfortably relocated to Montana or Wyoming, and I would likely stay in a small village until the outcome of the war became more clear. Finally, there is a very small chance that I would head for D.C. I know congressional law backwards and forwards, and I could see my skill set being useful to the executive or legislative branch.<br>  <br>  3.) What precautions would you take?<br>  <br>  I would buy as much ammunition for my two pistols as possible. I would bulk up on bottled water, batteries, vegetable seeds, and cheese. I would also cash out all of my bank accounts, as there is nothing useful that a debit account to an invaded banking system can do for me.<br>  <br>  4.) Would you go on the front-lines?<br>  5.) Would you die to save the country?<br>  <br>  I am answering these together. I would not do either. This is difficult for me to say, because I am actually a very nationalistic person. I love this country, and it's rich history, I love living here, and I have always felt that way. <br>  <br>  However, I have had a very, very difficult life which could have been made better by a more authoritative administration. I have lived without health insurance for four years now, while a country less than 1000 miles north enjoys it for free. My rights have not been protected in many ways, I am a homosexual and had to live through public school quietly masking this to protect myself where the employees at my school would refuse to help. I was barely parented because my mother, a single parent, was forced to give up her job as a mom in order to keep our home from being foreclosed on after my father left, and none the less, with no money, and a discriminating community and country against my sexual orientation, I received no government aid for college because in the eyes of the state I am a single, white male and and only child. <br>  <br>  Despite this, I put myself through the Ivy League and I have spent my life trying to develop myself as someone objective, thoughtful, and artistic. Someone who is useful to the world, not simply the nation. I enjoy the freedom this country grants me, and I do love America, but it was my mother's choice to bore a child in this free nation, and since that moment, I have never felt like the country has granted me or my small family anything for which I owed it my life, a life that is young, and intelligent, and that I have struggled to make better. A life that I am willing to give on the front lines of a war, especially considering that as a homosexual, my life is currently not considered good enough for military sacrifice, only if I am forced into it by a draft.|`|Aa6IV2U9aa	1.)

A good stride will be the same if not more then what your stride would be jogging.  I have used many and the ones with longer strides were the best as far as comfort and form. An elliptical trainer with a short stride will annoy aggravate and cause discomfort.  Some of your better trainers are the ones you would find at a fitness gym, those are more money but the strides are perfect.
oFUljjhnaa	With respect to your laptop: Not a problem, or at least it does not present any more danger than other devices in your house (eg. toaster, electrical wiring, fridge, etc..) If however it is equiped with a wireless network, WiFi, etc. then there would be a slight increase in the amount of RF exposure but unlikely to cause any great issues.<br>  <br>  Similarly, your microwave is unlikely to be a problem, provided the microwave in question is in good working order and condition.<br>  <br>  If this is not the case, then exposure to microwave radiation for extended periods may well cause certain cancers to occur. They may also cause cataracts, birth defects and other serious health problems including nervous system damage, headaches, and pacemaker interference. A plaster wall between you and the faulty microwave would do very little to attenuate the radiation field power levels.<br>  <br>  However, new ovens are typically designed so as not to exceed 1mW/cm2 of radiated power. In addition, any leak that exceeds 5mW/cm2 at a distance of 2 inches from a microwave oven is considered to be dangerous and the oven should not be used. Ovens can deteriorate over time and should be checked to ensure that these limits are not exceeded.<br>  This can be done by your local service centre or you can purchase an earth leakage detector and have it on hand to keep a regular maintenance check of your oven. <br>  <br>  If an oven is in good condition then it would present no more risk then anything else around your home such as eating processed food, using mobile phones, living near HV power lines, or living in your house which exposes you to all sorts of electromagnetic radiation from the electrical wiring and other household appliances.<br>  <br>  As far as your cell phone is concerned, well this is certainly a real and most serious concern and we'll be seeing more and more reports as time goes on, as the true effects start to materialise. The thing to remember is that cordless as with mobile phones have only started being used extensively in the last 12 or so years. It will take time for any definitive effects to become apparent. (typically 10 - 20 years), therefore anyone who says that they are not harmfull is doing so without any real knowledge or understanding!<br>  <br>  The fact is that radio frequency (RF) transmissions are DANGEROUS. As to how dangerous, well that all depends on the intensity and duration of exposure. No one really knows and those that say it is not a problem, have no evidence to substantiate that it is not, infact there is more evidence coming to light to say that it is a potentially real serious problem! Any possible adverse effects that these devices have on human tissue, should not be taken lightly! It is still early days and time will tell as it did for smoking, asbestos related products and countless of chemicals and herbacides, in the past. <br>  The simple fact is that everyone should be aware that the longer you use the phone the greater the adverse affects are likely to be. There is no doubt whatsoever, and it is well documented that high levels of RF are DANGEROUS! Cell phones and to a lesser extent DECT phones such as your cordless home phone, transmit at much lower energy levels, but their consistant and prolonged use may well have a cumalitive effect. <br>  <br>  Although there is no proof to indicate that mobile phones can cause cancer, there is more and more doubt being cast, suficient debate and more studies happening to cause doubt as to the relative safety. As a telecommunications engineer I am aware of the power density levels produced by mobile phones and the effect they can have on different people. <br>  Mobile and cordless home phones transmit using radio frequency radiation (RFR). These are radio waves located within the electromagnetic spectrum. X-rays which are known to cause cancer through ionizing radiation are also within the electromagnetic spectrum, however, RFRs cannot cause cancer in the same way as x-rays because RFRs are non-ionizing.<br>  <br>  However, high levels of RFRs can cause health effects through heating the human body (thermal effects), resulting in headaches and possibly other symptoms, such as you are experiencing. <br>  <br>  Whilst it cannot be shown at this point in time that the thermal effects from mobile phones are a health hazard there is a considerable body of scientific literature which describes the effects of RFR in biological systems that cannot be directly attributed to heating. These effects are referred to as non-thermal and have been demonstrated to cause alteration in animal behaviour, or changes in the functioning of cell membranes.<br>  <br>  A bit more credible reading can be found here;|`|QqY8YgGDaa	You and me  can experiment about these topics<br>  -You can write e mails to me through this section by clicking in  profile section

Your genes are what they are. Your natural body shape is what it is. If your genes say you will be a fat short kid.. there is nothing that can change this. Now, do not get this confused however with other things that get involved. Example: the body builders that you see on television and in the ads for bow-flex. Thous people had the genes to make that possible. They are able to get the muscles. Some people, can try all they want and it will not happen. This is of coarse talking about the natural way. Me, for instance, I kinda have a six pack. I smoke, and sit on the computer all day. My point is that it never hurts to exercise, but every body is different. The only person that can tell you if your shape is the healthy shape for you is some doctors. I say that because some actually still use the BMI scale, which is stupid for this very same point I just explained. <br>  <br>  Tho, if you really do not like what your parents gave you.

e9dsg0KQaa	sounds like you have depleted your muscles... although every other day shouldn't have done that.  Perhaps you just were low on protein in the days leading up to the bad workout.<br>  <br>  Lots of things can make you weak on occasion, dehydration, low iron, poor diet in the days leading up, overtraining, stress... the list goes on.<br>  <br>  I think it was probably just a fluke.<br>  <br>  perhaps you have reached a plateau with the same exercise over and over and you need to do a different exercise.|`|92m5g4YEaa	it can be due to alot of factors, 1. did you take something for the pre-workout like 30 mins before you start to lift? 2. Did you have any carbs the day before to give you energy? 3. Simply you didn't manage to give your muscle rest since the last time you lifted, your muscles need at least full 24 hours to and up to 3 days depend on individuals to recover.  Also, you should take something for the post workout a little creatine or protein powder to feed the muscles that you just work so that they'll feel better the next time...|`|c6ed324bb70246f047e05d3ca9d5e4fdaa	Maybe you're doing too much all at once and your body can't take it. It may need a rest.|`|b9d7e1ea8425adc0a8398611a1d49c2caa	I am not an expert in the least. But there is a show on FITTV where the instructor uses various sizes of weights depending on how she feels for the day. Some days she lifts light weights and other days they are heavier.My guess, is that on her "weaker" days she uses lighter weights. On her stronger days they are heavier. So my point is, try varying your load. Lift lighter weights when you don't really feel the same strength threshold. I believe that we all have strong days and weak days dependin g on what is going on inside. For example, us girls get a monthly cycle that definitely makes us weaker but that shouldn't make us stop lifting. We should just lift something lighter. You guys have both "weak" days  and strong days...lift accordingly and you'll move forward.

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!

You may be able to reduce that dry, gritty feeling by:<br>  <br>  Applying artificial tears: You can use these lubricating drops as often as needed to provide relief. Use preservative-free eyedrops to avoid an allergic or toxic reaction. <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-edge-newspaper-2007/nov-12a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-edge-n...</a>|`|HxXduL1maa	The eye depends on the flow of tears to provide constant moisture and lubrication to maintain vision and comfort. Tears are a combination of water, for moisture; oils, for lubrication; mucus, for even spreading; and antibodies and special proteins, for resistance to infection. These components are secreted by special glands located around the eye. When there is an imbalance in this tear system, a person may experience dry eyes.<br>  <br>  When tears do not adequately lubricate the eye, a person may experience:<br>  <br>  Pain <br>  Light sensitivity <br>  A gritty sensation <br>  A feeling of a foreign body or sand in the eye <br>  Itching <br>  Redness <br>  Blurring of vision<br>  Sometimes, a person with a dry eye will have excess tears running down the cheeks, which may seem confusing. This happens when the eye isn't getting enough lubrication. The eye sends a distress signal through the nervous system for more lubrication. In response, the eye is flooded with tears to try to compensate for the underlying dryness. However, these tears are mostly water and do not have the lubricating qualities or the rich composition of normal tears. They will wash debris away, but they will not coat the eye surface properly. In addition, because these emergency tears tend to arrive too late, the eye needs to regenerate and treatment is necessary.<br>  <br>  Treatments for dry eyes may include:<br>  <br>  Artificial tear drops and ointments. The use of artificial teardrops is the primary treatment for dry eye. Artificial teardrops are available over the counter. No one drop works for everyone, so you might have to experiment to find the drop that works for you. If you have chronic dry eye, it is important to use the drops even when your eyes feel fine, to keep them lubricated. If your eyes dry out while you sleep, you can use a thicker lubricant, such as an ointment, at night.<br>  <br>  <br>  Temporary punctal occlusion. Sometimes it is necessary to close the ducts that drain tears out of the eye. This is done via a painless procedure where a plug that will dissolve quickly is inserted into the tear drain of the lower eyelid. This is a temporary procedure, done to determine whether permanent plugs can provide an adequate supply of tears.<br>  <br>  <br>  Permanent punctal occlusion. If temporary plugging of the tear drains works well, then silicone plugs (punctal occlusion) may be used. The plugs will hold tears around the eyes as long as they are in place. They can be removed. Rarely, the plugs may come out spontaneously or migrate down the tear drain. Many patients find that the plugs improve comfort and reduce the need for artificial tears.<br>  <br>  <br>  Restasis. In 2002, the FDA approved the prescription eye drop Restasis for the treatment of chronic dry eye. It is currently the only prescription eye drop that helps your eyes increase their own tear production with continued use.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other medications. Other medications, including topical steroids, may also be beneficial in some cases.<br>  <br>  <br>  Surgery. If needed, the ducts that drain tears into the nose can be permanently closed to allow more tears to remain around the eye. This is done with local anesthetic on an outpatient basis. There are no limitations in activity after having this surgery.|`|CO6RyQlkaa	The Doctors Book of Home Remedies II Dry Eyes<br>  For the wet-eyed crowd, that film can turn to an eye bath when you're watching a <br>  classic weeper like, say, Old Yeller.

Treat yourself to a small treat each day but dont gorge on sugar. If you cut out all flavored drinks, even ones labeled diet, you'll cut your calorie consumption a lot. Stick to lots of water and the occasional glass of milk.<br>  <br>  Just eat healthy and that may help you stop craving food so much, but dont make yourself crazy by worrying about how much you eat. Your 13 and I ate a lot then too. I just noticed that I needed to not eat junk.|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	I was overweight too for awhile. Then I spoke with a nurse about it. She told me that the trick of dieting is eating only when you really feel that you are hungry, not because other people eat breakfast, dinner and supper.  You don't need 3 meals a day. .. That's the whole thing in a nutshell, and it worked for me and it sure didn't take long.|`|qR4uLNH6aa	maybe its your time of the month
11iIIQlYaa	Very good question there are plenty of things i can help you with on this subject. First, yes you do need lots of fruits and veggies but you dont have to eat more than protein and carbohydrates. Leaner meats such as Salmon, Tuna, and Chicken, are very nutritious and the protein is extremely good for you. You should eat 6 small meals everyday with all those things listed and you can have carbs but make sure they do not derive from sugars. Eating six smaller meals per day will raise your metabolism to burn more calories while your resting. Hope this helps you and if you need anymore info you can email me at - amartin99999@msn.com|`|A7m8DFgkaa	Just try for whole foods.  Limit processed and packaged foods.

A man who believes in magnetizing will believe in their cures and think that he is doing the right thing by magnetizing the body, without actually having a mastery of where to use the magnet and where not to use it.  The polarization caused may be suitable for specific conditions but may not be for all conditions or to the body as a whole in the long run.  MRI is done by doctors because they think that it is conclusive because of the fact that they believe in "seeing is believing", whereas the sense of sight is imperfect and could be deceptive, while the symptoms emanated by the body every now and then are more dependable provided one knows how to assess it, analyze it and come to right conclusion for which certain amount of wisdom, absolute knowledge of body as well as the mind, the components which constitutes the body and their eternal functions, the spiritual knowledge of the body and the mind,  luck and grace of God are required apart from booking knowledge, scientific inquiry, expertise, clinical experience and the like.  If these fundamentals are not satisfied, the cure what is achieved is temporal, suppression, and will metamorphose to another form and surface sooner or later.<br>  <br>        I have seen certain peculiar symptoms like the mouth feeling like a wrenched clothe, tiredness and exhaustion of brain, rather brain fatigue, problems in oxidation in particular constant yawning, lethargy etc. in patients and when questioned whether they have undergone the magnetic therapy, the answers were in affirmative.  In such cases I have been fully successful to remove the whole lot of symptoms with a single dose or two of Zincum Metallicum.  Zinc being a bad conductor of magnetism is found excellent in reinstating the original magnetic state of body (the factory-setting as we may call).  Human beings treat, God Cures.  If anyone thinks that they are the masters of the profession or the subject. it is only a matter of ignorance. <br>  <br>  Medicines should be used in consultation with doctor.|`|mCF4wGjdaa	Hi Aaron,<br>  it's a bit more complex than that but, yes, it works. <br>  <br>  I presume that Serendipity is referring to the pharmaceutical employees and their pseudo research.

bKfAte8aaa	I don't think there is a requirement for a space on if you want to get braces. I had no spaces in my teeth- they just needed to be straightened a little (sucked my thumb when i was little). Talk to your dentist and ask if he knows a good orthodontist. Then set up a consultation and see where it goes. Your orthodontist will probably know best.|`|zSUVZxTcaa	Yes.  Any gap is big enough to get braces.

The drug tends to "deaden" nerve endings to help relieve pain...and when that wears off, you experience the weird pain that you describe as your "nerves being messed with"...<br>  <br>  If chronic pain is a part of your life, you owe it to yourself to find a good pain management clinic...because that can help you manage life and medication, and come off of the more potent, narcotic medications.<br>  <br>  I have a narcotic medication that I can use for times when the pain is really intense, but I bet I don't use it more than four or five times a month...that is a major improvement in my quality of life!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Hormones are doing all sorts of weird things to your body and you are still growing.  <br>  <br>  My guess would be that this is "probably" hormonal and a benign cyst....but I am not a doctor.  My very best advice to you is to tell your mother and the two of you go to the doctor to have it checked out (especially if cancer runs in your family).  If it is NOT cancer, all you have done is spend a little money and you have wasted your time.  But if it is cancer, then you could have saved your life as that is better off caught early.

Have you had any other symptoms? if not physical symptoms, have you had a cut? burn? anything? you could try tylenol and see if that helps break it.|`|eMPeOsRBaa	you might have mononucleosis, mono for short.<br>  the only way to tell is to get a blood test done and even then, mono won't always show up on a blood test.<br>  also, there aren't any antibiotics if you do have mono, so in reality the test is sort of a waste of time and money.<br>  my advise would be to take a tylenol pm... it will help with the fever and also help you get to sleep. it's like killing two birds with one stone.|`|4wkIOVDoaa	If this has lasted longer than a couple days you should go to the doctor or walk in clinic tomorrow.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	Your body is trying to fight off a foreign invader.

rNDmuLJYaa	i'm going to be honest with you...i'm currently at ohio state and i got straight A's in high school.  You should def get more sleep then you are now.  in high school you can make up answers and still get them right.  Also another thing i did was do my HW in other easier classes.  I took all honors and ap classes too.  since you are freshman you will learn to balance your coarseload better, and realize it isn't that important to overload yourself with classes because you have a long time to complete them.  TAKE STUDYHALLS. trust me you have time.

j6dAbXCAaa	Sorry to hear about your mom.<br>  <br>  I have read that lemon juice can be used as a topical. I've never tried it, and I don't have much confidence that it'll work, but your mom can give it a try.<br>  <br>  Have her drink lots of water, 1 oz for every 2 lbs of body weight, each day. Allopurinol is what I take, but your doctor would be able to say if it would hurt her other conditions. Foods that help to make the body alkaline rather than acidic are best. Again, for diabetes, I'm not sure what's ok and what isn't, but try these:<br>  <br>  Instead of pasta, try potatoes.<br>  Instead of meat or poultry, try tofu.<br>  Instead of peanuts, try raisins.<br>  Instead of pop, try 100% fruit juice (V8 Fusion is my favorite)<br>  <br>  Best of luck to her!|`|eODVVS8taa	My sister recently had gout of her big toe.

BwvhafvLaa	Well someone, maybe another adult, or one of her friends really should have a little chat with her mom.  Even if it did grow back thicker or darker, the benefits of feeling smooth for the summer outweighs that problem.  Check out the pharmacy .  There is some type of light pad that is used in a circular motion that kind of wears away the hair.  I think it has a light sandpaper surface that rubs off the hair.  There are all sorts of products available other than shaving, but someone really does need to convince the mom that this problem is causing severe embarassement to your friend and she wants to feel confident like her friends...best wishes.|`|qIAcO0gGaa	Well 5th grade does seem young for the older generation stand point so her mom is right in her own way. But my mother was more understanding of everyone is different and now a days girls develop sooner. If her mother is worried that if she starts too soon because it will make her hair grow even more then you can discuss waxing or other options but to leave it as it is would be wrong. It is a very good question to bring up because hairy legs is a big factor in self-esteem and you are a good friend for caring and supporting her.|`|iDqVy21gaa	Go with her to the beauty salon<br>  <br>  And each enjoy a professional waxing treatment including a Brazilian bikini wax<br>  <br>  It's important to get a professiol beautician to advise you on shaving for the best methods and how to shave properly<br>  <br>  : )<br>  <br>  So you will be ready to wear your hottest bikinis at Spring Break|`|fT6x5YChaa	If she feels uncomfortable why not epilate. First of all I would not recommend shavng since the hair grows back really fast and is thicker. Better use an epilator or wax. It's her choice. Whatever she decides just make sure to read the directions carefully and use it properly. Good Luck!|`|qxAcwDsjaa	there is no way it grows back thicker. what happens is when you shave, the hair gets cut kind of at an angle, and when it grows out (stubble) it gives the APPEARENCE of being thicker. that being said, leg hair (mine at least) does grow pretty fast. best to shave every other day. or use nair.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, it is not unreasonable for her mom to say no.  You are both in 5th grade, that would make you both about 10.  Way too young to really start shaving.  You will spend practically the rest of your adult life shaving, so why start so young?  It isn't fun and the hair actually grows back more coarse over time.  I would try to gently ask your mom why she objects but also understand the possible reasons behind her objections. Good luck!

I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was   <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

And Acai Berry (fruit of Amazonian Acai Palms) is as a food staple and for their rejuvenating and detoxifying properties.<br>  <br>  So rather than you buy weight loss product first, then you are disappointed with that weight loss pill, then you buy another diet pill again, and this case is time after time, it means that you have lost much your money and without satisfied result ?.<br>  <br>  So I just can say, it is better you try two or more diet pill product free, there is no one to try. Then you compare the result between one diet pill products with another. If one of diet pill work, maybe you want to get it more, or leave it if this diet pill is not satisfied.<br>  <br>  Good luck and success for your diet !!! :)|`|QRAdcC3Naa	They are all crap, trust me they don't work, I've tried them.

pQszqyTgaa	Yes, there is, but I don't recall the name of it. I was watching the Discovery Health channel, it was one of those weird medicine shows. Anyways, a couple had this little girl, and one day she was all bruised and they didn't know what was wrong. The took her to the doctor and turns out she ran into the table or something, and she broke her jaw. She really couldn't feel. I saw it a long time ago, so I don't remember much more, but you could try searching it.<br>  <br>  There's also the type of people who really don't feel pain. I've had a bad past, so I cut myself off emotionally and I never came back. I'm getting a lot better, but sometimes nothing in terms of physical pain, could do anything to me. You could stab me, pinch me, do anything, and it wouldn't make me cry. But that's a whole different thing from the story above about the little girl. Her not feeling pain, was true, her nerves weren't responding. Mine respond, but my emotion doesn't respond.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|OyqEe4Qpaa	The disease is called Congenital insensitivity to pain, or congenital analgia, or CIPA.

ETcBRko3aa	The "Lithium" that is used to treat Bipolar is a SALT COMPOUND.  It's REAL name is Lithium carbonate, symbol Li2CO3.  <br>  The Li is only the lithium ion which combines with the carbonate to form the salt.<br>  <br>  Upon ingestion, lithium becomes widely distributed in the central nervous system and interacts with a number of neurotransmitters and receptors, decreasing norepinephrine release and increasing serotonin synthesis.<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to your doctor about the fact that you removed salt from your diet.  I was told to make sure that I have a normal salt intake when on Lithium.  Lithium causes dehydation because it interferes with the regulation of sodium and water in the body.|`|8Og1L5Graa	Table salt--the stuff you eat--has the formula NaCl.  A salt, more generally (as a chemistry term) is just a neutral compound (basically that means it has no charge) made up of ions. The term "lithium salts" has nothing to do with NaCl.  A Lithium salt is made up of a Lithium (Li) ion (or ions) and another ion (or ions) so the charges cancel out.<br>  <br>  <br>  You need to talk to your doctor.  Diet can certainly help or hurt your treatment, but you need to take your medicine if it is prescribed.  I am close to someone who has a similar disorder and sometimes does not take his medicine.  It really hurts those around him and himself.  Three months is a long time to go without the treatment you need.
EIrdLq6Zaa	People who do not suffer from this can not relate. I too hate it when some one walks by me and say, "smile" I explode inside. I hate it when I'm walking with my face down (I just don't want to look at people) when I'm in that state of mind. I could not for the life of me explain to my companion why I was so depressed. I know it was mostly due to stress and pressures and chemical imbalances, but his "get over it" was no consolation. Here's my suggestion- It's important for your boyfriend to understand why you react the way you do. Sometimes you're "fine" other times "just leave me alone"<br>  <br>  Is it possible for you and your boyfriend to have a visit with your therapist. Discussions of your private issues causing these attacks do do not need to be brought up. But if your boyfriends really cares for you, to understand you better, the mood imbalances etc... perhaps he can deal with it better. I'm sure a lot of it has to do with self--esteem too. Believe me I know this only too well. <br>  <br>  Just to throw this in. My father who's elderly and has health issues suffers from depression. My mother just doesn't get it because she doesn't suffer from it. I had a long talk with my dad (he's 86") I wanted him to understand that i DO know what he's going through. For him to hear a lot of the traditional depression feelings. it comforted him to know that wow- someone really knows what I'm going through. It was in a way my mom could never understand. I wish you well and as my therapist says, "Maintain altitude."|`|75ptpPP1aa	Dear Hippieeit,<br>  Of course its impossible for your boyfriend, or anyone to understand what is happening if they haven't had it or lived with somebody who had it.<br>  You need to be taking your medication and until such time as you are reasonably stable, I'd advise you to spend less time with him when you're feeling depressed or anxious. I know you can't always anticipate when that's going to be, but I usually have some warning signs about my depression coming. Maybe you do too. Once the medicine kicks in, go back to whatever is normal, but you don't want to freak him out.<br>  Another excellent thing you can do is go online, with him there, to www.webmd.com and type depression in the search box. Read all the information with him and explain anything he doesn't understand. Then do the same with anxiety. Maybe you'll learn something you didn't know too.<br>  Best of luck, <br>  Sandilynn|`|Ml5IvWKKaa	It really takes a certain kind of person to be able to handle someone as delicate as yourself. <br>  It involves a lot of selflessness and also strength to not take your fluctuating emotions personally. <br>  Its hurtful to some people when they feel unable to help. You can not make him understand...he has to find that with in himself. <br>  He should really take the time to do some research so he can better understand your sickness. Have you allowed him to feel comfortable asking questions about your disorders? <br>  What ever you do, don't feel guilty. These are things that you are unable to control at this time...it is not your fault. <br>  Keeping up on your treatment is key to your recovery...don't lose sight of that.|`|nxGLJ0Etaa	It's hard for people that have never come into contact with someone with mental illness, or experienced it themselves to understand it.

If you trust him enough them maybe take him along to your next session to help him understand, or print off information off the internet about your condition and ask him to read it. Sit him down and explain to him what's going on in your head, the feelings you get and tell him that you can't control or help the things you do.<br>  <br>  If he cares for you enough, then he'll gradually begin to understand and accept it, but if not, find someone that does.

Oq5a5hRhaa	Your doctor will want to give you the pelvic exam. You are supposed to start having them as soon as you begin having sex, and wanting birth control implies that you will be having sex. The reason for this is not to determine if you're healthy enough for the pill, but to monitor your cervix for any changes that could be caused by HPV or cervical cancer. Once you become sexually active, you are at risk of catching HPV (a large percentage of women have it), and having HPV dramatically increases your risk for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is fatal unless it is caught before there are any symptoms, and the only way to screen for it is through a PAP smear (part of a pelvic exam).  Any doctor who would prescribe birth control without first doing a pelvic exam is acting irresponsibly.<br>  <br>  As for whether your general practice doctor will do the pelvic exam himself, that depends on the doctor. Some general practice doctors will do it (mine does), others will not and will refer you to a gynecologist.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you are not yet ready to get a pelvic exam, then you are not yet ready to go on birth control, and you are certainly not ready to be having sex.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	If you are ready to have sex then you are ready to have a pelvic exam.<br>  If your doctor does not do one,including a Pap smear and breast exam, then s/he is incompetent.|`|sBjTrz4Xaa	If you are honest with your healthcare provider, then a pelvic exam is not generally needed to just go on birth control. However, this also depends on your age. If you check out (google) pap exams the American Academy of Gynecology recommends 18 years of age to start having pap/pelvic exams done. Earlier if you are sexually active. So if you have been sexually active, then your doctor/healthcare provider will need to do a pap/pelvic exam. The younger you are when you first start having sex then the higher your risk becomes in developing cervical problems including cancer. Main purpose of the pap: screen for changes and screen for cancer.|`|AA12245847	You will need a full pelvic exam to get the pill or any other form of birth control.  It's the law

RoqVeuLmaa	To become a physician in general:  4 years undergrad degree, 4 years med school, at least 3 years residency (post grad training).  For a specialty in addiction medicine, many choose to either specialize in family practice or psychiatry (3 and 4 years residency, respectively).  You can pursue the additional training during residency regarding addiction med.  Salary:  120,000 to 160,000 (estimate)<br>  <br>  Outside of becoming a physician, you could pursue psychology or social work, both of which are instrumental in the team who helps people with addicitions.   Those would be a 4 year undergrad degree with likely 2 years for a masters degree.  Salary:  social work 25,000-45,000.  Psychology - varies a lot 35,000 to 100,000 (but likely toward the lower end).<br>  <br>  Good luck!  There is certainly a need out there for people interested in this career pathway.

There is no need for them, the female reproductive tract cleanses itself, including after intercourse and menstration. Secondly, "feminine cleansers and deodorants" are can often disrupt the vaginal environment causing yeast and bacterial infections. Your vagina has necessary and healthy bacteria in it that keeps you healthy, when this bacteria gets upset it can cause yeast and bacterial infections. Also, your vagina should not have an odor and therefore you should not need a deodorant or cleanser.

1ed6375beb5e8d962bce480e6040bc0caa	The type of kock ring is a users preference.   You can use it as tight as you want to.  It should not be left on to long.  But again each person is different.<br>  <br>  I am wondering why you need a kock ring as if you understood what really kock rings are for, maybe you would think differently .

721cb05b6c1e188e641c62b435f765c9aa	I had my gallbladder removed last July and i asked that same thing. The gallbladder acts as a storing station for all the bile your liver makes. it mainly just sits around in there waiting for you to eat so that it can help you digest your food. and if the bile sits in there to long it can give you gall stones, that is what happened to me. well anyway when you have had your gallbladder removed the bile just goes directly into your intestines and help digest the food there. nothing to worry about, it just cuts out one of the steps in your digestive process.|`|AA12302857	It is dumped into the stomach, then comes out with everything else....Stool may be yellow....You must do everything you can to decrease the amount of bile your liver makes.....no, no,no,no fatty foods, no fried foods, no processed foods with high fat content,  cut down on red meat, eat lots of veggies and carbohydrates......Good health to you...|`|2ac765e627a894a7901e5c0e969ad704aa	The gall bladder usually stores bile and releases it when it is needed.

Depending on what birth control method you choose whether it's the patch, pills, shots, IUD's, or the newest nuvaring.  I work in a pharmacy and some side affects of ALL birth controls methods are break through bleeding, increaded or decreased blood loss during menstration, weight gain, weight loss, tenderness (vaginal or breast), risks of certain cancers (this risk increases if you smoke), heatattacks, blood clots, and even stroke.  Another risk factor is the longer you are on birth control the harder it is to convieve when trying to concieve!   But, some drugs even lessen cramping during or before your time of the month and lessen blood loss during menstration or even cease a period altogether. Recently Ortho Evra is proven to promote blood clots, strokes, and other harmful side affects.  You should definately talk to your dr about any kinds of concerns you have on a particular drug or method!

I can not say for sure how quickly your side effects will go away, it will depend on how fast your metabolism can break down the medicine.  <br>  <br>  However, I must caution you and anyone else against doing this.  Besides the possiblity of you hurting yourself, are at increased risk of hurting someone else.  As an example, the seminar I attended regarded a teen who while "Robo-tripping" experienced increased rage and ended up murdering his mother and nearly his younger sister.  <br>  <br>  It is very important that you follow the recommended dosages on medications and only use them when you are experiencing symptoms.|`|SneoWPRJaa	not sure. but at least now you know better than to do it again. you should have known better than to do it the first time.

79854e76845cbccab0f05c5235b43448aa	- Step One<br>  Set small, realistic goals. If you have a lot of weight to lose, try for 5 pounds, relax a bit and then go for 5 more.<br>  <br>  -Step Two<br>  Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants!<br>  <br>  -Step Three<br>  Sneak in extra exercise in addition to your regular program. Park at the far end of the parking lot and walk; take the stairs instead of the elevator.<br>  <br>  -Step Four<br>   Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  <br>  -Step Five<br>   Choose foods that you like. Learn to prepare healthful, low-calorie foods that taste good by checking healthy cook books for new recipes. Eating well doesn't have to mean eating dull.<br>  <br>  -Step Six<br>  Eat smaller, more frequent meals. This way, your body starts to increase its metabolism so that calories are burned faster. Also, mini-meals can prevent overeating.<br>  <br>  -Step Seven<br>  Plan ahead. Keep the fridge stocked with healthful food and you'll be less likely to run out for high-calorie, high-fat junk food.<br>  <br>  -Step Eight<br>   Keep a food diary. This will help you pinpoint where you can improve your diet.<br>  <br>  -Step Nine<br>  Once you discover your favorite snack time, be sure to have plenty of healthful options available.<br>  <br>  Tips & Warnings<br>  <br>      * Lose weight with a friend, or join a support group.<br>      * Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>      * Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>      * Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>      * Lose weight gradually--you are more apt to keep it off. A safe amount is 1 to 1 1/2 pounds per week.<br>      * Consult a doctor to find an exercise program that is best for you.<br>      * Crash diets can help you lose weight quickly, but most people gain the weight back. Some of these diets are also unhealthy and dangerous. If you choose to go with a specific diet plan, choose one that is medically credible.<br>      * If you have any questions or concerns, contact a physician or other health care professional before engaging in any activity related to health and diet.

XVrcCGloaa	hey champ, personal training is an awesome career. i don't know where you live, so can't advise on your insurance and registration questions. as for part time work, most gyms and pt studios won't hire employees. the majority hire trainers as sub contractors, so you will need your own registered business. this means you will be able to decide your own hours, your own rates (in most cases, otherwise you can negotiate) and you should be entitled to tax benefits.<br>  <br>  you will need some tolerance as not all clients are as motivated as you and i. this is where your enthusiasm comes into play. when they see how happy, positive and energetic you are, they will start to copy you and fall in love with training making your job more enjoyable. there will always be clients you don't enjoy training, and the beauty is you can just refer them to another trainer. you see, there is no benefit in training someone you don't 'mesh' with because chances are, they aren't enjoying it either and probably won't get the results they're after. so by refering them on, it becomes a win/win situation.<br>  <br>  another challenge (we don't believe in negatives (except the training technique)) is getting clients in the first place. once you have them, 83.527% will keep coming back as long as you deliver an enjoyable session. the hardest part is getting them to walk through your doors. this is where contracting to a gym or studio is great as they should have a steady stream of people just starting out. just remember, if you are passionate about health and fitness, and it shows in everything you say and do (your sparkly bits) then you shouldn't have too much trouble getting started. <br>  i hope this helps

DFIIR7jAaa	first of all don't stress out too much about it, the doctors are so used to doing the exams on patients that they are used to it. they will probably give you a pap smear, which is they gently open your vagina with a plast insert that doesn't really hurt, just a lot of pressure, and whip your cervex with a long q tip to test for cancerous cells. after that they may give you a pelvic exam inwhich they just kinda poke and prode your waist on the outside to see if everthing is ok. they may check your breasts for lumps but that isn't major either. you should be fine, don't worry and you are doing the responsible thing for going!|`|AA12341414	The doctor is going to want your previous sexual history, if any. They more than likely will take a urine sample weigh you, take your blood pressure. Depending how old you are they will show you how to give yourself breast examinations to check for lumps. Don't worry about them looking down there. They see it all day, every day so it's nothing new to them. They'll just be down there for a minute or two and you'll be out of there with your undies back on before you know it.
AA11374838	First off, losing that much weight in that short amount of time is really unhealthy for your body. Usually the "healthy" way to lose the weight is 2 or 3 pounds a week. Secondly, it doesn't make sense to lose the weight and diet and get into that routine only to go and eat more food and gain everything you've worked for to lose in the first place. I'm not trying to sound mean, but it really makes absolutely NO sense. As far as the snacking issue, (should you decide to continue in the weight loss) I've incorporated healthier options: no sugar added or sugar free items, baked chips (if you absolutely are just craving chips), and low sodium items. Fruits are a great snack as well as veggies with Lite Done Right Ranch. I have a sweet tooth and I've totally fallen in love with Sugar Free Jolly Ranchers, Crystal Light hard candies and the Sugar Free Twizzlers. (I swear there's no difference!) Plus, it's all about portion sizes as well. Only eat what a serving is. Also. sodas are just no good, even the diet ones. I drink lots of water, unsweetened juice and milk. I hope it helps.|`|6643931244137fd7cff33c594964d2f3aa	I have the perfect diet for you... this diet is for medical uses for people that need to lose weight quick for surgery... you  will   lose 10lbs in 3 days...

c2a1c3143290469ceba913da663d85cdaa	Fever is a body mechanism that helps us in destroying the <br>  germs of diseases. During fever, some of the body organs <br>  start working fast and some physiological processes get <br>  accelerated. The rate of production of hormones, enzymes <br>  and blood cells increase considerably. These hormones, <br>  enzymes and blood cells start fighting the germs causing <br>  fever. During fever, blood circulation and respiration <br>  become faster. Both these processes help the body in <br>  getting rid of the poisonous germs present in the body. <br>  Fevers are often the symptoms of a serious infection.|`|h07mqlPhaa	Fever is a rise in our body's normal temperature, which, on average, is 98.6 degrees Farenheit. Fever is part of our body's defense mechanism. When our bodies are fighting infections, our body temperature rises. But why? Fever is a symptom of an infection. Fever is a symptom of almost every disease known to man. Illnesses caused by viruses and bacteria invade our bodies and make us sick. Without our immune system to fight off these infections, we could die. Colds, tonsillitis, otitis media, the flu, bronchitis, tetanus, measles, mumps, chicken pox, AIDS, pneumonia are all examples of bacterial and viral infections. Temperature is usually measured in the mouth by a thermometer being held under the tongue for 5 to 8 minutes. Other ways to measure body temperature include rectally, axillary (armpit), and using a special temperature taking device in the ear.|`|ceCfltwkaa	pathogens enter the body as a result white blood cells raise the body temp, often the bacteria can no longer survive with the temp.....in short we get a fever in order to kill bacteria

PgYCDFhjaa	i'd be a little worried too (not to alarm you though!) im a young active chic and my resting heart rate can be about 80 sometimes on certain days. this was taken when i was going to school for my medical classes. We took our pulse and b.p. everyday. Active at 165 is a little much also..how are you even to count to 165 with it beating that fast?! lol..anyway, you could bave tachycardia which means a fast heart rate.

It may not seem like a lot but it adds up. Over a period of a year, taking the stairs can burn off an extra five lbs. of fat.<br>  <br>  Snack on Pickles Pickles are delicious and they have only 1 calorie each!<br>  <br>  Drink H20 Before You Eat Drinking water before you eat will fill you up so you don't eat as much. Try to down 2 glasses of water 10 minutes before each meal. You'll notice that you can't down that entire pizza if you do, and you definitely will skip deser.<br>  <br>  Skip The Soda If you do nothing else, at least skip the soda for 1 meal a day. This can save you up to 3,000 calories per week!<br>  <br>  Don't Shop Hungry When you are about to go to the supermarket to pick up food for the week, make sure you eat a big meal before you go. You'll notice that suddenly all of those junky foods won't have the same appeal and you'll be more likely to make wiser decisions.<br>  <br>  Don't Be Fooled By The Fat Free Phenomenon Skip the fat free frozen yogurt and other sweets that are loaded with sugar. Very often these fat free sweets are filled with sugar to make up for the taste they lose with the fat.<br>  <br>  Put Up Photos Put up some photos on your refrigerator of how you want to look and/or pics of you when you were in great shape. This will help motivate you to resist every time you feel like reaching for that gallon of ice cream. You can also put a pic of you when you looked really out of shape to show you how you DON'T want to look. This can be even more motivating.<br>  <br>  Eat Slowly It takes a while for the brain to register that it's full. If you eat slow enough you'll give your body time to notify the brain that you've had enough and you'll eat less because you'll feel full<br>  <br>  Don't Eat With Fat Friends Yeah, we know Joey's been your friend since the first grade but that doesn't mean you have to go eat with him. Getting into the eating pattern of fatter friends can be a quick road to destruction.<br>  <br>  Don't Eat Everything On Your Plate Americans have the habit of finishing everything on their plate even when they are full. It probably stems from our mom telling us that we need to finish everything because there are starving kids in Ethiopia that would do anything for our food. Forget about all of this guilt. Your mom will be much happier when you eat less and live much longer to take care of her when she's old.<br>  <br>  <--Little Tricks To Help You Lose Weight Fast--><br>  <--<a href="http://www.healthylifeday.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=186&Itemid=62" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthylifeday.com/index.php?...</a> -->
c2c0a1f90a23029b6724b90b310707e5aa	There is no easy, fast way i'm afraid. The best is lots of high intensity cardio exercise (see HIIT as mentioned earlier), and a good healthy diet. Take your time, set weekly goals and don't starve yourself.<br>  <br>  Copied from source below.<br>  <br>  "1. Calories count!The signal that triggers your body to release adipose from fat cells is an energy deficit… you have to burn more than you eat.<br>  <br>  2. Cut calories conservatively. Starving yourself may cause quick weightloss at first, but never works long term because it actually decreases the activity of fat burning enzymes that release fat from the cells. to avoid this “starvation mode” use exercise to BURN THE FAT, not very low calorie crash diets.<br>  <br>  3. Get control of your weight now. If you are gaining weight, and especially if your weight is climbing upwards out of control, make a decision to STOP RIGHT NOW. Your fat cells might be multiplying, making it more difficult to burn fat in the future. NOW is the time!<br>  <br>  4. If you’ve already lost weight, you must be forever diligent. Your fat cells are not gone, they have merely “shrunk” or “emptied out.” Fitness is not a 12 week program, its a lifestyle. To stay lean you have to eat clean and stay active<br>  <br>  5. Genetics are only a minor factor. You may not have control over how many fat cells you were born with, but you do control the major factors that determine how much fat you store: lifestyle, exercise, nutrition, mental attitude."|`|y87HGa2paa	weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint.  eat less, exercise more.  its just that simple.  everyone loses weight at a different pace.  when i lost 20# a few years ago, it seemed like nothing was coming off.  then all of a sudden people started to notice and my clothes got looser and looser.  it takes 6-8 weeks to start to notice a difference.  just keep it up slowly so the weight stays off.|`|SwP3tE2Uaa	Just eat only complex carbs, lean meat, and lots of veggies.

Sixty percent of Americans are either overweight or obese, including over 20 percent of teenagers. All are at risk for serious physical and emotional health problems.<br>  <br>  Over three-quarters of obese adults, for example, suffer from high blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, diabetes or osteoarthritis. Nearly 40 percent have more than one of these conditions. They are also at risk for stroke and cancer. There are over 300,000 deaths per year from weight related causes.<br>  <br>  Body Mass Index or BMI is a good way to determine if you are carrying too much weight. The BMI is based on your height and weight, but it gives a better estimate than the older ideal body weight tables. Click here to calculate your BMI.<br>  <br>  Although there are many general causes for weight problems, the most responsible self-empowering one is that you’re simply eating too many calories for the amount of energy you’re expending. To control your weight you either have to decrease your calories or increase your exercise or some combination of the two. On and off dieting will not take care of the problem. Maintaining a healthy weight is a matter of day by day conscious control of both the amount and types of foods you eat and the level of physical activity in your life.<br>  <br>  <--Weight Loss--><br>  <--<a href="http://www.healthylifeday.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=81&Itemid=62" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthylifeday.com/index.php?...</a> -->|`|rffJ6eLBaa	well may be you are at your ideal weight now...and the one you think is ideal may not be it!<br>  But you can experiment with trying to reduce meats and replacing them with veggies as a try and spend you weekends on gardeining or trekking....should help|`|y1XH0DGjaa	Up your exertion on the treadmill and eat fewer calories.

What they do is cause the uterus to slough off any lining it has built up, so that if you had an egg that was fertilized it will NOT implant onto the wall and will be expelled.  IF the fertilized egg (assuming that you had one) implanted in the wall before you took the pills, the pregnancy will still continue.  The pills will not force an abortion.  From my experience the pills are VERY effective, so don't worry.   : )|`|ae7622ff556408acc77ced6e5b986cf6aa	Getting your period early is normal if you've taken the morning after pill.

I don't want to scare you, but there is a slight chance that the pill did not work. To be on the safe side, get a blood pregnancy test done- many family planning clinics and student health centers offer them for free, and the ones who don't charge about $10-15.

WwD8Ab8xaa	Metabolism is essentially the speed at which our body's motor is<br>   running. The speed at which our body burns calories is called the metabolic<br>   rate. It's how fast your "motor" is running when you're still in a<br>   reclined position or sleeping. About 60-75% of energy is expended by the<br>   body at rest in such activities.<br>  <br>  The metabolism is based on the number of calories we burn throughout<br>   the day. Our body constantly burns calories to keep us going whether we<br>   are eating, sleeping, cleaning etc. People with a lower percentage of<br>   body fat (i.e. muscular) have a higher metabolism than others that are<br>   less muscular because muscle uses more calories to maintain itself than<br>   fat. Some people have a slower metabolic rate and have a harder time<br>   staying slim. Younger persons have higher (faster) metabolism because of<br>   the increased activity of cells. A slow metabolism actually causes to<br>   store fat. The slower the metabolic rate, the greater the weight gains.<br>   How to build muscles to improve metabolism? What type of exercise is<br>   ideal that speed up metabolism so that you burn calories even at rest or<br>   sleep?

Squatting helps, but not really that much. And it's also advisable that you take up exercises not only for your thighs but also for your other muscles because that way, you can burn calories faster.
410b06f56b4160baef435c7ade19f121aa	One thing that I have found to help is doing some walking/jogging etc for cardio.  That will burn calories which will make you slim down all over.  I find that lunges and squats will help build muscle, but that won't do you any good if you still have a layer of fatty tissue over the muscle.<br>  <br>  Try yoga, too.

8tbYU17Kaa	Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds series is great for beginners.<br>  <br>  It's really basic cardio steps (walking, knee lifts, side steps, and kicks) and arm movements - plus, you use hand weights for a portion of the video to get some sculpting done. Another bonus is that it doesn't take up a lot of space in your house to do it.<br>  <br>  For someone more experienced, I like The Firm series. It's brutal, but the results are outstanding.
zCmY8jLDaa	Losing weight is a simple equation: if you burn more calories than you eat, the weight will come off. Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the daily calorie needs calculator <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/caloriecalclb.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...</a>  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  Beginners Guide to Dieting  - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/begdieting.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/b...</a>|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	I'm sorry mate but losing weight fast does not work, you will just end up putting more weight on.<br>  you need to look at it like it will take 2-3 years to get the wight off i know its not what you want to hear but its the truth, you don't put it on over night so its not going to come off over night|`|BpNsjtl6aa	1) Keep it simple first<br>  here's 2 articles on eating healthy -<br>  <a href="http://lose-quick-weight.blogspot.com/2007/08/lose-quick-weight-sensible-ways-to-shed.html" rel="nofollow">http://lose-quick-weight.blogspot.com/20...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://diets-and-exercise.blogspot.com/2007/09/take-control-of-your-body-with-healthy.html" rel="nofollow">http://diets-and-exercise.blogspot.com/2...</a><br>  <br>  2) Eat steam food, vegetables, fruits, lean meat<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bestways-to-losebellyfat.blogspot.com/2007/09/lose-10-pound-fast-key-superfoods-you.html" rel="nofollow">http://bestways-to-losebellyfat.blogspot...</a><br>  <br>  3) drink plenty of water and green tea<br>  <br>  4) Avoid junk food, snacks and soda drinks<br>  <br>  5) have 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only) to keep the tummy<br>  satisfied<br>  <br>  If you're not too sure on how to plan it, try this link<br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/fatloss4idiotsreviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/fatloss4idiotsrev...</a><br>  <br>  6) exercise - combine weights  and cardio.  <br>  <br>  here's a review link to a worthwhile workout, turbulence training<br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/turbulencetrainingreviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/turbulencetrainin...</a><br>  <br>  For abs, read these 2 blogs (great articles on abs) - <br>  <a href="http://thetruthaboutsixpackabs.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thetruthaboutsixpackabs.blogspot....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/thetruthabout-sixpackabs1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/thetruthabout-six...</a><br>  <br>  7) form a support group - invite friends, relatives, parents, partners<br>  to participate in a healthy lifestyle, and keep you accountable.

4HwaSn4Jaa	Never give up the exercise.  Aside from weight loss, it will help you avoid a tremendous number of diseases later in life.  And... exercise puts your body in a higher metabolism state where it is easier to use energy.  A 40 minute cardio workout keeps you at that metabolic level for about 3 - 4 hours.  If you worked out 40 minutes morning noon and night, your body would be a calorie burning machine.  weight loss would be easier.<br>  <br>  Echo what everyone has said.  You DO have to reduce calories, but do not fast or skip meals.  Eat a low fat, low calorie meal as often as you can.  4 or 5 times a day.<br>  <br>  I just lost 50 pounds.  More to go, but it's going well.  Hang in there!  You can do it!|`|dfcdace149ca4068c093f8f63591283faa	dont starve. infact u need nutrition to have energy to burn the fat off!|`|AA11548204	Shun starvation!!!binge on fresh fruits and vege...1 cup of ice-cream every 5 days wont kill your diet though...you may opt for low fat milk/fruit yoghurt to keep your body nourished with enough calcium and iodine to burn off excess body fat more effectively..a cod liver oil pill a day will help you safeguard your existing muscles so that they dont get soar..|`|EqyU8tlUaa	absolutely not! It's actually good that you have set up a routine and working out often. I think the losing weight factor ways more heavily on your diet and eating patterns.

When you have great health you will look great as well and the weight loss will follow a good diet and exercise program.<br>  <br>  Please don't starve yourself... eat lots of quality food ! It is true that you are what you eat.  Stick with quality carbohydrates, fruit, vegetables, protein lean meats, fish etc. Avoid soda or sugary drinks, junk food and also learn how to decipher a label on food packaging... <br>  <br>  What I would suggest is that you change your exercise to get better results... if you are going to be serious and put the time in you should do it properly.<br>  <br>  At the moment you are doing light aerobic exercise - which is not actually burning that many calories - sorry :( - but better than nothing.  Also it must be a bit boring... doing that for an hour.<br>  <br>  To lose weight fast, and to get maximum benefits you really need to combine aerobic and anaerobic exercise.   You will burn a lot more calories in the same period of time, get a lot fitter - feel better and look better, faster.<br>  <br>  If you are serious look at something like this: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://bowflex-review.com/Bowflex_Revolution.html" rel="nofollow">http://bowflex-review.com/Bowflex_Revolu...</a><br>  <br>  I prefer to exercise at home - so I can watch tv and listen to my own music, while I work out... my level of fitness is fantastic.

They immediately come to an end searching for a "shortcut" in the form of a pill or supplement. In fact, pills and supplements did not do anything except give you expensive urine.<br>  <br>  You need to set up exercise refer to Gymnasium’s standards, but at least you can get your cardio from several way like running, walking, jogging and riding a bike on a daily basis no less than 1-2 hours on medium or higher speed. If you just take exercise under 30-60 minutes, the possibilities are you just burn your blood sugar, not fat.<br>  <br>  You need to replace your foods wisely, because there is a slightly differences between foods that burn fat and foods that turn to fat. Moreover you need to scrutinize your carbs and calories levels as a habit.<br>  <br>  Here’s the ultimate contradiction. When you eat less, your body burns less. When you eat more, your body burns more. The more you slash your calories, the more your metabolism slows down. <br>  <br>  In fact, very low calories diets can actually make you fatter. It is physiologically impossible to achieve ‘permanent’ fat loss by starving yourself<br>  <br>  After all, you need the proper mental attitude to keep you on track to achieve permanent fat loss and keep it forever. As well as to safe you from any possibilities that could change your mind from proper scheme to lose your fat permanently.  And the possibilities could be come from outside or inside you.<br>  <br>  I hope you get pleasure from my short answers.<br>  <br>  However you can also constantly attempt to search for truthful fat loss scheme from credible ‘Master’ in the field and the ultimate programs that they recommended achieving desirable permanent fat loss.|`|dTF3qP2caa	I have a great suggestion for you,<br>  go to www.mypyramid.gov<br>  <br>  at this website, you can put in how much you eat, your current weight, your goal weight, how much exercise you did, and how many calories you should consume, how many you burned, etc...<br>  <br>  Its great. I use it every day and its very helpful. I suggest start with waking up like a half an hour earlier and go for a walk or jog just to start the day out better. If you have pets, take them for a walk, they will love you even more!!! :)<br>  I live on the North Shore of Oahu with the best beaches, so i take my dog on the beach every morning for a long beach jog and when she and i get back we both feel better. So, exercise in the morning. Also, during the day, get involved in some kind of organized sport. Such as tennis, a soccer team, a volleyball team, etc... Or sign up for junior life guarding. Go to the pool, ride your bike, just get out and get in cardio. For muscle toning, get 5 pounds weights, and work with them. You dont want to get bulky, but toned.<br>  <br>  Also, crank up the music in the house and just dance full out. Try to find a dance studio that you could take hip hop classes from. You can burn like 600-700 calories in one hour at a hip hop class. I take jazz, and its a work out. At home too, do crunches, pushups, etc... All that jazz.<br>  <br>  Eating healthy is something like this, you can always improvise...<br>  Breakfast:<br>  1 whole grain bagel, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. Fruit salad, and 1 cup of skim yogurt. (This may sound like a lot, but its better to start ur metabolism with a big breakfast rather than binging later in the day)<br>  <br>  Lunch: Salad. 2-3 cups of mixed greens. 1 grilled chicken breast. A handful of cashews, avocado (half of a big one, you can have a whole one if its small). 1 cup of other chopped veges such as tomato, cucumber, peppers, etc... Have a glass of skim milk, and top ur salad with salsa. Also, have a banana or an apple, or some kind of fruit.<br>  <br>  Snack: 1 fat free greek yogurt, some berries, and a kashi granola bar.<br>  <br>  Dinner: Grilled salmon, quinoa sauteed in olive oil and garlic, and steamed vegetables. A skim yogurt or glass of skim milk.<br>  <br>  Dessert (optional) have a skinny cow brand ice cream.<br>  <br>  good luck. Please let me know what works for you so I can possibly follow in your steps.<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to exercise. Try to go for intense exercise for like 45 minutes to an hour 5 weeks a day. Also, just work exercise into your day. Park farther away, walk, ride your bike, go to the beach, play volleyball, walk someones dog. Just get outside. Good Luck!!!|`|CciXZNYraa	Burn fat. The benefits of exercise aerobically are the most important. Good exercises for the waist are walking, swimming and rowing. But anything exercise that burns fat is beneficial. <br>  <br>  Do abdominal exercises like crunches, but do them with a twist. Lay down on your back with your knees bent and slightly apart. Cross your arms at your chest. Lift your head and upper shoulders off the ground, moving your right elbow to your left knee. Move back to center, and then move your left elbow to your right knee. <br>  <br>  Lift your legs. Lie on one side, supporting your head with your hand. Raise the upper leg slowly, keeping it straight. Hold, and then slowly lower it to the ground. Repeat on the other side. When this move becomes easy, try lifting both legs up together. <br>  <br>  Make a bridge with your torso. You may have called these back bends when you were in school. Place hands flat on the ground on either side of your head. Keep feet flat and knees bent. Push up with your hands so that your stomach rises and your back arches. Hold for a couple of minutes. <br>  <br>  Twist your torso. Stand with feet apart and clasp your hands behind your head. Twist at the waist to the left, and then back to center. Twist to the right and back to center. Each time, twist a little farther. Another method is to place a broom handle behind your neck and drape your wrists over the stick. Twist from left to right, concentrating on each movement. <br>  <br>  Bend to the side. Standing straight with your feet apart, hold a three- to five-pound dumbbell in one hand while bending your waist in the opposite direction. Repeat on other side. <br>  <br>  Touch your toes. Stand in a wide stance. Reach one hand toward the opposite foot, keeping legs straight. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dfcdace149ca4068c093f8f63591283faa	here is what my dietician recommends - follow a practical diet. Make sure your plate has this ratio - 50% veg, 25% carb, 25% protein. eat 900 gms of veggies a day. Start your meal with a big salad or soup. have a snack every three hours. fruit (ideally berries) or soy nuts. just 2 tablespoons of soya nuts subside hunger pangs . substitute white bread and rice with brown. lose one kilo a week. that is the ideal.  <br>  Pick an exercise regime you like. then you are likely to stick to it.  buy a pedometer, and take 10,000 steps a day. it will also measure the more intensive stuff you do. maybe you should pump iron? or kickboxing?

Swelling, tenderness, and even a hard painful tissue where my underwire lies are my symptoms, usually mid cycle between periods.  Went to a doctor one month when it was really bad, he told me to take the vitamins above, and switch to a soft cup bra when I hurt, and to wear a bra at night while I experience pain.

Therefore, I hardly think you should think that you are that fat. Especially at 13, when it is quite normal to have weight fluctuations.<br>  <br>  However, if you do want to lose some weight you'll have to be realistic and dedicated about it. It is generally considered reasonable to lose 1-2 pounds of weight a week (Though some people  lose more the first week or two). Anything past this and you are probably only loosing water weight (which WILL NOT last) and/or may be seriously hurting your body . Even if you are at the top of this weekly range, you'll probably <br>  will only lose about 10 pounds in your 5 week time schedule.<br>  This is a great goal to set for your self and 10 pounds makes a huge difference in a person's appearence!<br>  <br>  As far as diet and fitness go. Since you are a teenager and are still growing you should NOT restrict your calorie intake as much as a normal adult. Doing so can be very harmful in your age group. However, you can probably find a nutritionist, nurse practitioner, or doctor who can tell you the right range. <br>  <br>  Generally, try to avoid foods that have lots of salt or processed sugar. Eat all your servings of fruits and vegetables. Find better ways to cook meat and other foods (for example grilling is much better than frying) and so on.<br>  <br>  As far as exercise, you don't need a treadmill to walk! The standard is to do at least 30 minutes of cardio exercise (including brisk walking) three times a week. Or, walk at least 12,000 steps a day (10,000 is for general health but the extra 2,000 will help you lose) and keep track using a pedometer. I know it's hot so why not find a gym or shopping center, or even inside your house? <br>  <br>  Some people like to do strength training using free weights or even just their own body as leverage and there are many good, basic exercises available (try looking online). As a general rule, do not do strength training more than every other day, especially if you are not used to it (the day off gives your muscles time to rebuild). Also, because you are still very young, I would caution you to be very careful and consult with a personal trainer.<br>  <br>  And, be sure to stretch after you exercise!  <br>  <br>  I am not a doctor and the above is only my opinion. I think most of what I said is fairly standard, but I do think it would be really beneficial for you to talk to someone like a trainer or nutritionist in person who can help you set reasonable goals and teach you how to achieve them. <br>  <br>  Also if you want an online support group and some good tools for weight loss (including fitness demos and a calorie counter) try Sparkpeople. It's free! I promise I don't work for them or anything, but they are really good.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|NjZXGTQdaa	I don't think there's really any safe way for a 13 year old to lose that much weight in such a small amount of time.  The only thing you can do at your age is exercise and diet.  Make sure to take a vitamin daily.<br>  <br>  If you just have to diet, WeightWatchers really, REALLY worked for me and at a pretty steady rate.<br>  <br>  You can do crunches and sit ups and lift dumbbells.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.  I am really searching for answers for you, but I can't think of a way for you to lose the pounds that fast.|`|Ik06FzuZaa	You could use this award winning natural green tea extract:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bionaturaldrops.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=1" rel="nofollow">http://bionaturaldrops.com/index.php?mai...</a>|`|nvC7XcBUaa	Maybe you should go to the gym , or buy a work out  video at the store if you don't know what to do .

AA11585429	First off, losing 20lbs will make you underweight. (I assume you mean pounds instead of cals?)<br>  <br>  at 15, 5'7'', and a moderately active lifestyle, you are burning 2550 calories per day. You can lose down to 115lbs before you are dangerously underweight (BMI<18) Models on the runway get kicked off if their BMI is <18, just for scale.<br>  <br>  So, a healthier goal for you might be... 10lbs? That give you a little lee-way if you want to keep exercising. But you can NOT eat less than 1800 calories a day. Whether you like it or not, your body is still growing. If you eat 900cal/day, you are not going to have enough nutrients or substance for your body to continue building. You have GOT to take care of your body. Eating that little will cause your body to hoard what it does get and to turn it to fat because that takes longer to burn. This conversion is what we refer to a "slowing your metabolism". When you go back to eating normally again, your metabolism won't be the same and you'll gain the weight back, and then some while it repairs. (Trust me, i've been there done that and it sucked. I had to lose it all again the right way.)<br>  <br>  Now, a healthier plan. If you are burning 2550cal/day (this includes all of your activity) and you eat your minimum 1800, you're still netting a great 750cal burn/day!! That's great - right down the middle. You never want more than a 1000cal burn per day. So it takes 3500cal to lose one pound. you will lose 1.5lbs per week. That's nothing to sneeze at because this is weight you can KEEP off. This kind of diet will allow you to keep your metabolism up, so as long as you're nutritious, when you go back to eating normally, you will NOT regain the weight.<br>  <br>  So lets say 10lbs by September? Well, it'll take a little less than 7 weeks to lose the weight at 1.5lbs per week and September is... just over 7 weeks away =)<br>  <br>  Why not try this nutritious plan and lose the weight where you can keep it off? =) Looking at your numbers, you're perfectly healthy as you are. There is no NEED for you to lose weight unless you want to become healthier - which you can't do by starving your body. Help yourself and choose a diet that works! I've been calorie counting since January and I'm down about 25lbs and have been keeping it off =)|`|FhmEGBvyaa	Firstly you can lose as much weight as you want in a short time period, however, you will gain it back. I am speaking from experience from someone who has been there done that with fad diets. There is the obvious liposuction, however, the recovery time is 3 – 6 months and it sounds as though that you’re in a rush to lose the weight for possibly an event with no downtime to spare. I am and have been on weight watchers for 2 years and lost 25 lbs. It was a slow and steady race, however, I haven’t gained the weight back ‘cause my diet has been stabilized and so was the weight loss from 0.5 – 1 lb/week. <br>  <br>  Remember the weight gain didn’t happen overnight, it happened slowly over time, the same is with proper healthy weight loss, you can’t have/perform miracles over night. <br>  <br>  These are some things that I do.<br>  <br>  1. Drink lots of water as it kept me full longer. <br>  2. Used an appetite suppressant like hoodie to make sure I don’t go over my daily calorie intake. <br>  3. Did cardio and toning 3 – 4 times a week. <br>  4. Made meal and recipe modifications as I cooked. <br>  5. When I dined out, I made sure that I wasn’t shy about asking the kitchen to make modifications like dressing/sauce on the side, half portion ordered the kids meal etc. <br>  6. Brushing teeth after every meal, the mint acts like an appetite suppressant and without the taste in your mouth, you can easily forget about the food. <br>  7. Never drank diet cola, the aspartame actually made me crave food more for some reason. <br>  8. At work I take a break before lunch and either take the stairs in the building or just general toning without weights. We have a gym at work so I do about 15 minutes of weights which not only gets my blood flowing but releases tension from a**hole customers. <br>  9. Bought snacks in bulk (to save money) and properly measured what a cup or portion was and made individual baggies. There are some snacks on the market that are 100 calorie snacks, however, I find those to be too expensive than just buying in bulk and separating the portions yourself. Also by physically separating them yourself, you get an idea of what a portion is supposed to be and you  learn to properly eye ball correct portions.|`|r3XBXe7naa	no 15 year old should have to eat only 900 cals a day, especially if you're going to do regular exercise. you're going to need more energy or else you will burn out.|`|HNVoUHRnaa	<a href="http://weight--loss-information.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://weight--loss-information.blogspot...</a><br>  <br>  Try looking here.

lHjT15SLaa	If you use it and actually put in (get a sweat up) and take advantage of the settings like walking up hills then yes they will definitely work. Cut back on your food portions, put in at least 45mins on the treadmil 5-6 times a week and do some weight training 3 times a week and you will definitely lose weight. Use cans out of your pantry to do some weight training for your arms do 12-14 reps X3 for each then drop to the floor and do some sit-ups making sure you keep your chin off your chest and focus on pushing the small of your back into the floor do 20 normal sit-ups then push your knees to one side and do another 20 then swap and face your knees to the other side and do another 20 working the side abs then lift your feet to the ceiling and raise your hips slightly do another 20 and work your lower abs then drop your feet to the ground again and do 20 quick pulses do not rest in beween these your muscles need to keep working or it will be useless. Sit-ups do not lose the stomach fat, you need a good cardio work out like your treadmill to lose the fat, sit-ups help for strengthening. If you follow all of the above you will start to see your stomach losing cm's, make sure you cut back on your portion sizes when eating. Place your food on a small plate instead of the large ones it makes you think your eating more than you are. Eat plenty of fruit & drink plenty of water and stick with it you need to give yourself at leat 6 weeks to really see a difference and to get into a routine with your exercising if you stick with it it will become a part of your daily routine. Saying all that you are only 14 so you should see results a lot sooner.

miTzSvBbaa	Sure it's ok. However, it's better to eat an orange everyday than to drink juice everyday. I love oranges myself and have eaten as many as 8 in one day.<br>  <br>  As a nutritionist, I generally tell people to avoid fruit juices. Most fruit juices are prepared poorly and thus, you lose a lot of the valuable fibre in the fruit, and you're only consuming sugar if you only drink juice. <br>  <br>  My advice: Eat the fruit as it is. Always better than just having the juice.|`|AdM9fWLjaa	Ive never heard it to be bad for you it does keep your immune system up to date and all that... the only thing ive ever heard was that if you drink it right before bed it might give you nightmares but i dont even see how that is logically impossible.... i think thats just a psychological superstition ^.^ hope this helps|`|CfkzttWyaa	A cup a day will actually do you some benifts. Your on the right track about it having vitamins and calcium. I would only stick to a cup a day though because even though it has vitamins and such, there can also be alot of sugar in juices. Moderation is key. You should be fine though! |`|MFh0MeW4aa	No its fine to drink orange juice everyday. But the thing is that it a citrus acid and that breaks down your enamel on your teeth so you might not want to drink it every single day. Or if you do make sure you get a special toothpaste with enamel protector. I hoped this helped!|`|dXHc6OYzaa	It's bad for you because the acid in it can wear away the enamel in your teeth. It's okay to drink it everyday, but just make sure you brush your teeth.|`|rQrtVb8kaa	The more pulp the better. <br>  Fiber is important for the diet.<br>  OJ contains a lot of sugar although one glass a day isn't so bad.|`|r7QZ9CTXaa	Its good for you. As long as you don't drink too much it's fine. They probably said that because of sugar but thats not really a concern. |`|Pu8qqK3jaa	I think drinking one cup a day of orange juice is not too much at all. I drink orange almost every day too.|`|OZCq1hX3aa	its not bad for you, at all you can drink it every morning  don't worry|`|JOfhyIwBaa	definitely good for you. I drink a cup a day too and I feel great.

Orange juice has a lot of sugar in it as do all juices.  Even though these are natural sugars they can cause health problems if you drink too much of them.  Also some folks have a bad reaction to citrus acid...causes heart burn and reflux in some people.  Everything in moderation is always going to be the key.|`|ffJcrsmLaa	It's fine to drink a cup every day. It's even better if it's fortified with calcium. The only thing that could be bad about it is that it has some sugar in it, but not nearly as much as soda does.|`|fa3395ec50c737646f26f5ca2e0c0af1aa	I think it's benefits outweigh the risk of a little too much sugar tremendously. So, I vote YES.|`|Y8Suz0l3aa	OJ contains a lot of acids.|`|jbEibn2Naa	Store bought orange juice has lots of sugar in it, and other nasty stuff to keep it from going off. No matter what the bottle says, even if it says 'no added sugar, etc' don't buy it.<br>  <br>  The only orange juice you should be drinking is homemade. Buy fresh oranges, and squeeze them yourself. If you don't like the pips, you can always strain your juice at the end. If you find its to strong, you can add a bit of water. Juice that is homemade always tastes 100% better.|`|9Hb2rn48aa	It's great that your drinking orange juice. Don't listen to them. 1 Cup a day is loaded with healthy vitamins that you need in your diet.<br>  But, orange juices can be deceiving! Check the ingredients before you buy it. It must be 100% natural juice and the only ingredients should be oranges, nothing else! |`|nhmp6rVyaa	Well once a day is still ok, but let say u been drinking it for 4 times a day, it will cause u to get diarrhea.

Shaving your head before a test cannot help you.|`|5zSqeugCaa	You can detect it up to 6 months after....sorry bro.|`|gMzGP7KWaa	No I dont think you can pass the test. |`|NwlEI5B3aa	90 days is the hair test standard.<br>  <br>  <br>  Q: How does HairConfirm? compare to urinalysis or saliva tests on the market? <br>  A: The primary differences are historical use (approximately 90 days dependent on hair length) and the inability to tamper or contaminate the test and therefore directly change the test results. Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Opiates and Phencyclidine are rapidly excreted and usually undetectable in urine 72 hours after use, and in saliva 48 hours after use. The detection period for hair is limited only by the length of the hair sample and is approximately 90 days. |`|GxySnn3naa	A great way to get rid of anything in your system is to buy from <a href="http://www.directdetox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.directdetox.com</a> I have used them in the past and the service is awesome. Family run operation that understands how you feel and how much privacy is a concern. Fantastic place, I can't say enough about it! They have detox drinks to synthetics. They have home drug test kits too!|`|H3h4j4aKaa	in my experience you should be honest with your employer and tell them that u had smoked before but you are clean and sober now so that IF something shows up on the test it wont be a total shock ... hope i could help |`|aMtKXdj1aa	Dude, first of all, I'm going to say that you're a dumbass for smoking that stuff, that's not healthy, and you shouldn't need to be told that. And secondly, that stuff stays in your hair for months, so you're screwed. Maybe you'll make better life decisions in the future.|`|z7XXwnflaa	how much you smoke and the length of your hair will be the two main factors on beating the test... I suggest you try the MacCujo method of detoxification.<br>  <br>  Buy Aloe Rid and use it every day up until the test.<br>  <br>  Buy Vinegar, Clean and Clear, and Tide<br>  <br>  I suggest wearing rubber gloves to apply all this stuff because it could burn a bit, Clean and Clear has ethyl alcohol in it.<br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  <br>  1. Approach your sink with the ingredients in hand, along with a towel and a shower cap. Kitchen sink probably works best. Run warm water over your hair, have the towel close by to wipe chemicals/water that drip down from your forehead.<br>  <br>  2. Pour vinegar on your head. Massage into hair.<br>  <br>  3. Pour Clean Clear over your head and massage in. This stuff burns a bit but is better and safer than gasoline. Don't the mistake of not drying all skin around your ears and forehead.<br>  <br>  4. Put a shower cap on and let sit for around 20-30 minutes. Have towel in hand to wipe away anything that drops down. Clean and Clear is probably the strongest chemical you deal with in this process.<br>  <br>  5. Take a small dab of Tide liquid and wash all of this out. Your hair will be the squeekist clean its ever felt with the Tide. So very concentrated indeed.<br>  <br>  Do this 5 times over the 3 days before the test.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

You either hit a plateau and need to ramp up your routine or you've lost inches but have gained muscle mass (which weighs more than fat mass).  Ramp up your cardio, that might help.  |`|Ny5qTO37aa	m at same stage dude .. exactly same .. work out n eatin habbits !!<br>  <br>  well yes we need to increase cardio,, either time or speed..(speed is always a gud option) try doing 1.5 hr workout each day .. i m also trying ...<br>  <br>  n yea .. do take ur measuements .. there might be inch loss if not satisfactory weight loss..|`|Zv4tZ0tZaa	The fact of the matter is that bodies do NOT like loosing weight. You could have just hit a plateau. You will eventually get past it. Just keep in mind that you should not eat any less then 1200 calories per day if you are female or 1500 a day if you are male. Don't starve yourself. <br>  <br>  You may also need to balance the different nutrients (carbs, proteins and fat) a little differently. It could be that you need more of one and less of another. If you are constantly hungry you may need to do this. I know when I was dieting on more fruit and carbs I was ALWAYS hungry and I didn't loose fat, I lost muscle. I switched to a diet that was higher in protein and fat and I was only able to eat 1500 calories in a day and I was completely full. Listen to your body.
iQaKNSI6aa	They don't after its just that first they eat so much during and then they still feel like eating that much after|`|k6x2lVLYaa	It's natural, and your most likely producing more liquids because of breast feeding ; <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (-:|`|p3NsXo0baa	not everyone does I gained 25kgs in my pregnanacy and iv lost all of that since iw as 1 moth postpartum.<br>  I didnt breastfeed but its thought that breastfeeding helps you lose weight|`|2CBxqNcaaa	hormonal imbalance|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Most women gain too much weight during pregnancy and just don't lose it after childbirth.  Also, many women are more active and have more time for sports and the gym, etc., before having babies, and just don't lose the baby weight.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	I don't know that they gain, as much as they don't lose the extra they put on while they were pregnant.  After the baby comes, they just don't have the energy to exercise a lot, and will feel discouraged at the new, expanded waistline,   After that, they just eat what they like because they think it is a lost cause.  The other problem is that with the demands of a small child, grab and run food is a real temptation because it's just easier than cooking a regular meal.  Finally, some moms get into the habit of finishing off Junior's uneaten meals and snacks- and that doesn't help matters either.  But weight gain isn't a requirement of motherhood.  I have had four, and weigh what I did before I got pregnant with the first one.  It really just depends on the person, and how they approach motherhood.  If pregnancy was open season on the fridge, and they think that having a baby means they no longer have to maintain a decent weight, then yes- they will gain.

VtqdeSQ8aa	Some muscle pain is good. If you have tendon or joint pain that is bad.<br>  For weight routines you should only do the reps as long as you are keeping proper form to reach muscle exhaustion. If you start to get sloppy form, or "cheat" on the full range of motion, its time to stop working that muscle. Bad form and pushing it can cause damage.|`|DXJ6Ws8oaa	when you first start working out your muscles will be sore for the first week or so. after that your muscles shouldnt be sore anymore if you keep the same intensity. if you keep working out till you are absolutely sore then that's not good unless you are eating like crazy and planning to compete in a body building contest.|`|Jgoylfvqaa	Lol i know a guy name Levi<br>  SORRY I AM SOOO RANDOM!
vXR5L8Jfaa	No, the tampon won't slip out, it'll stay securely in place if inserted correctly. The first tip, just calm down and relax. If it's a little uncomfortable, then you probably didn't insert it correctly, so just take it out, and try again. The diagram on the box does help out and guide you through using a tampon. And remember that when using a tampon, do not exceed usage over eight hours, for that can cause toxic shock syndrome, which is rare, but can still happen if you're not careful, and start out with a smaller size, and when removing it, if you see there's blood on the string, then you need to go up a size. It'll take a little bit to figure out your size exactly, but don't be scared to try different sizes and different brands too. And just remember, relax, you'll be fine! (=|`|B1iBGRzUaa	You might have put it in wrong. Look at the diagram in the box. And no it wont fall out. Make sure when you put it in it isnt sticking out. It needs to be all the way in, it wont get "lost" lol

I got used to them quick and now I hate when I have to use a Pad|`|1cfd26f25289a1245a86fe8db1bf3dc2aa	yes. that's a long time, and yes you can use a tampon.|`|CoACAmkRaa	I've never used one (had my period for almost 3 years)<br>  I just cant get myself to stick it in|`|l7GjBVvhaa	It is never too late or early to use a tampon.<br>  <br>  Any girl who has her period can use a tampon. Tampons work just as well for girls who are virgins as they do for girls who have had sex. <br>  <br>  And even though using a tampon can occasionally cause a girl's hymen to tear, it does not cause a girl to lose her virginity.<br>  <br>  Whether a girl decides to use a tampon or a pad is completely up to her. <br>  <br>  It may take some practice putting in a tampon for the first time. <br>  <br>  It also helps to try a tampon for the first time on a day when your period flow is heaviest. That way the tampon should slip in easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.......
cvUbhrRkaa	to be honest, that "line" will probably not ever go away.  The fat cells in your body will remain constant - they may grow larger or smaller, but the number will always remain the same.  That line probably was caused b/c of the way your clothes fit, but by the time the line is established, it's usually too late to stop.<br>  <br>  The line shows the beginning of the "hardened" fat in the pedicle this fat is THE most difficult to get rid of.  You can exercise and work until your BMI is 15 but that fat will still be there.  Surgery is usually indicated for those wishing to get rid of it.

n0VqtKIOaa	Honestly, you do have a high refractive correction error.  I consider -10.00 to be pretty bad, especially since you have astigmatism in both eyes.  It can get worse depending on your genetics.  Reading a lot can contribute very little, but it typically comes down to genes.  <br>  <br>  If you take your script and divide 100 by it, it will tell you the farthest that you can see.  A person who doesnt have a prescription can see at 20ft or 610 cm.  With your eyes, you probably cant see further than 10cm.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.  My sister's are all above -8.00 and i am at -8.50  All that matters is that your eyes are healthy and that you can see 20/20 or better.  Just make sure you get your eyes examined every often because high myopes like us tend to have a higher risk of retinal dettachment.<br>  <br>  Again, don't be too concerned.  I'd be more worried if you were a -2.00 and couldn't get a visual acuity of 20/25.

hFSqYxgRaa	-  They take a swab sample of the inside of your vag to test for cancer.|`|4onT0qUxaa	A pap smear is a simple test for cancerous or pre-cancerous cells in the woman's reproductive organs. A scraping of tissue cells is taken from the cervix (the base of the uterus) and sent for testing at a lab. Women should have pap smears from the onset of puberty through most of their lives at regular intervals (usually every 1-2 years) for early detection and treatment of cervical/uterine cancers. If found early, they can usually be resolved without surgery.|`|k6x2lVLYaa	Where they take a napkin/paper like thing and smear it to your vagina then do research on the cervix cells to determine if you have a std, if your pregnant, etc. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

She inserts a speculum into the vaginal canal and takes a long swab (like a q-tip) and gently swabs the girl`s cervix (tip of the uterus) to get a sample of free cells. She then smears some on a mini board and this is taken along with the q-tip looking thing to a laboratory to check for presence of disease or infection. The test itself does not hurt, but you may feel some pressure. The test is recommended after a girl typically has sexual relations, or if something might be wrong with her sexual health. After the first test, a girl should get them done yearly to be safe.|`|gULNGNkFaa	They were having a test done to check for cervical cancer. The cervix is the bottom of the womb - or uterus, and woman can develop cancer there.

I hid it as well and used to tell people that I was fine... for years I would smile and tell the Dr's there was no problem because I was afraid of what they would do and thought my family would just brush me off and call me a drama queen.<br>  <br>  Then, one night I was driving home and when I got there my entire family was present... my mother found bloody rags in the back of my closet from cutting... and again I lied and talked my way out of it.<br>  <br>  I am now "old"... probably about the same age as your mother... <br>  <br>  You need to call your GP... talk to him... it is obvious that he saw that you needed something but with your Mum there he did not want to press too hard and he did not want to push you away.  If you call him he would probably talk to you and maybe you could then see about how to bring your Mum in... her anger is not really with you.<br>  <br>  Your Mum is angry because you are her "little girl" and you are in pain and she can't fix it and she is scared and frustrated because unlike when you were a child, she can't just put a band-aid on it and make it better.  <br>  <br>  It would not ruin Christmas... it would actually be a gift that would continue to grow... <br>  <br>  Try doing this... go to your Mum and tell her you are scared and you need her, give her the gift of your trust and let her know she is needed... tell her that you are having a hard time and are depressed and you try to take control by cutting and you don't want to do that anymore.<br>  <br>  Cutting is your way of "self medicating", you cause pain to try to overstimulate your nerves, have something else to concentrate on and trick your body into releasing hormones that will make things seem to calm down.  It is a short term fix...<br>  <br>  Depression is a medical issue... it is a chemical imbalance that can be treated with medicine and therapy that you can go to alone, just you and the therapist, to talk about the things that are deep down and screaming to be heard.|`|Gm5u4vWUaa	Look I know it's confusing and tough right now.  It gets that way when you become a teenager, biologically you have new chemicals in your body it makes things weird and your body learns to cope.  That’s why the feelings of depression and sadness.  <br>  <br>  Cutting is never the answer, when I used to feel depressed or upset I would call one of my friends or read a book or do something I enjoyed that didn't harm myself to take my mind off of things.  I think you need to tell the truth I believe that's part of the problem but I also think you need to see the bigger picture.  <br>  <br>  You need to tell you mom that your upset she never came to pick you up for the funeral.  You can't just hold it inside and hope she understands.  Look she may throw subtle digs at you here and there but it also sounds like she may be a little frustrated with you and this is her way of dealing with it.  Is she a single parent?  If she is I came from a single parent home and I know the frustration she must be dealing with.  <br>  <br>  Most good GP's won't give you drugs they’ll suggest talking to a councillor or psychologist.  You could even talk to your councillors at school if you have any.  Killing your self won’t solve anything; you’re young and there is a lot left in your life to experience.  Also, remember that as long as you have a roof over your head and food on your plate you have it better than about 50% of the world.<br>  <br>  If you need someone to talk to you can add me as a friend on yahoo answers and we can talk.  It's normal to feel the way you do a lot of people do at your age, and a lot feel it later on in life to.  You need to find something that can at very least distract you a hobby or something.  Get out in the world meet new people.|`|g5JqqtrIaa	Ok, I know you don't want to hear this but you need to tell your mum. I used to self harm and i told my school councillor and she told my mum and i was sooo soo upset,  and  i got the worst reaction from my mum. she didn't understand and she thought i was doing it for attention. I didn't talk to her for afew days, but in the end, she's your mum And once she realises something is wrong she'll understand.<br>  talk to her, or a doctor or something, don't live like this any longer.<br>  I've been there, there's only one thing worse, suicide... everything else will get better once you talk. You may even want to consider a rehab facility at your hospital. but..<br>  don't start cutting again.. please don't. <br>  Ruin christmas, you're family would rather a ruined christmas than one at a funeral<br>  <br>  Goodluck.<br>  God bless.<br>  <br>  Ps.   If you want to talk, I'm your age, helped others and it's   cherry-blossom-xox@hotmail.com|`|qq804CE8aa	You need to come clean with your mom.  You need to tell her how you feel.  By keeping the truth from her, you are only delaying and making worse the problems.  You also need to seek professional help.  Make an appointment with a psychiatrist.|`|d9afb5f10eed7750b0b4604b351f8e22aa	No one here can help you.  <br>  1. Stay in schol, no cutting and do your jomework.<br>  <br>  2.  Try to behave yourself and get along with your parents.  You are not old enough to get along by yourself so make the most of your opportunity for education.<br>  <br>  3.  Education is the only way to become self-sufficient.<br>  <br>  Don't spoil Christmas, but you might tell your Mom later.  She is just aggravated with you because you didn't go to school like you should have.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
f215f10f649937dd899be1c54ec5e3feaa	Wow, sounds like some complex OCD. If you feel like you HAVE to do it then it most likely is.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say what it means without knowing you and even then I'm no professional.<br>  <br>  If you feel able to stop it then there are a few ways you can although it depends how severe it is. Probably start off with an easy one, although Idk what would be easy for you. Whatever it is say for example having to eat in the same restaurant the next time you do it go slightly earlier or later and leave earlier or later, just a little at first, then gradually increase it as YOU feel comfortable with until maybe you don't have to do it as much or even at all.<br>  <br>  Also, how do you remember what happened from a previous year(s)?|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	what you are doing is robbing yourself of your present.

Obsessive compulsive disorder is defined by obsessive compulsions.  Doesnt require being a neat freek or germaphobic which people seem to think.  Neat freek is just one example.  Others are repetitive actions.  Having to turn a light off, then back on, then off again before you leave a room.  Having to always do things in a certain order.   Having to always go a certain way to work.<br>  <br>  The kind of behaviour you describe definitly sounds like it could be obsessive compulsions.  The question to ask yourself is would it REALLY bother you to not do them.  If it would really bother you, then it is dictating your life and it is a problem and very likely OCD.  You should try to see a therapist at very least.  Possibly a psychiatrist|`|HtdClNXUaa	Go get a brain scan, mental evaluation and go see a psychologist.

You still have over a month before your first meet, and you will improve a lot. The first couple weeks are bad, but after that it gets a lot better. Just make sure you eat good foods and drink a lot.

7s5OU7Sxaa	doesn't matter about protein and carbs if the total calorie count doesn't exceed what you need to maintain weight. if you gained 10lbs in a year and a half. that means you only   ate about  70  cals. more  per day than your body need.<br>  exercise stimulates muscle but food builds muscle. you need to up your intake 200 to 300cals a day at least to gain 1/2 a week. either a little bit extra at each meal or an extra meal/snack. <br>  don't worry toomuch about protein. if you are getting enough calories and aren't eating much junk food then you'll have enough protein to build muscle.
f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	We all have personalities that we must deal with; some are docile, some are forceful and some are angry and some are complacent.  Most people are capable of dealing with their anger and frustrations but some just need a little help, especially if they feel as if they can't deal with them.  Nothing wrong in asking for help and your parents need to realize this and need to realize that without help unwanted consequences can result from this such as you threathening to kill someone which is serious.

Nobody else. Get back on the meds and look the way you deal with anger. Why are you so angry? Would you want someone to act that way towards you? I'm sure you've it all before, but you should really look at the source of you anger and not the things bringing it out. Did anything happen to you that you have to be angry about? You're hurting yourself by feeling this much anger.<br>  <br>  I think you'll find if you let more things go and RELAX, you will feel much happier and start enjoying life more<br>  <br>  Forgive and FORGET.

HVKfuhp3aa	You are fine. You're basically slapped right at average.<br>  You can still lose a bit of weight to take off any extra chub, though.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	The people who say that you should be around 130lbs are on crack. Your BMI is 23.5, which is healthy. We can't all be Kate Moss, and shouldn't try to be.|`|kbGOMwi7aa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|HyBcKAf7aa	yes :)<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  you can do it|`|9Fs2GSN3aa	possibly.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	No.|`|KhvXdMpNaa	no need to|`|6juV48RWaa	no, just be healthy. work out a little bit, eat lots of protein. if you end up losing some weight from that then ok. it really isnt about losing weight, its just about being healthy and happy.|`|easYYET3aa	same weight but a lil shorter r u a male or female if ur a male no not really..if a women prbably 10-20 pounds i mean im trying to loose weight btw how old are you|`|KCqOTbBEaa	if you think it will make you feel better, in general, then yes.<br>  <br>  and technically, you are over weight|`|uAzToWC7aa	i dont think so because youre pretty tall. but if you want to , i saw on tv, that theres these things called slim shots, and they make you eat smaller amounts|`|5cJrnaQaaa	Nope nope nope|`|a5bpchuQaa	if you include a picture it well be easier to Judge .<br>  for your information no you don't need to lose weight.|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	when i was 5'7 i was around 130 so i guess you should drop 20.|`|YJH5YcjBaa	about 20pounds would be the ''proper'' weight but ehh who cares about that as long as your healthy and comfortable, eat right, im 5'10 and need to be 130/140 ...so your 5'7 so im guessing less<br>  <br>  <br>  lose weight for yourself, working out gives you energy, makes you feel great about yourself and positive, good luck oxoxxoxo|`|42DvP1AEaa	girl or guy?<br>  <br>  Guy- no<br>  Girl- your in a healthy BMI (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYB2Mqs24ss&feature=related)" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYB2Mqs24...</a><br>   <br>  I am pretty much the exact same statisics as you and I personally want to get to get down to 140.

XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Where do you live?

Enbfw2tJaa	If your contact with this guy has been limited to "dating" on the computer, change your email or site identity and all passwords. Do NOT continue to write him. No explanation to him is needed. Disappear into the virtual void. (He will not kill himself. Suicide threats over ending a relationship, especially so sparse a "relationship" as virtual chat, are purely manipulative.)<br>  If you have met with him in person or have given him any personal information online, such as your last name, address, phone number, school or workplace, etc.) you DO need to tell your mother. You could be in danger. It is a matter that should be referred to the police.<br>  If you have a trusted teacher or guidance counselor at school, you might talk to them. Most HS teachers and counselors are aware of the dangers posed to adolescent girls by contact with strangers on internet chat rooms.<br>  Controlling behaviour is a BIG warning sign in any relationship. Most abuse starts with overbearing attempts to control, modify behaviour and reactions and manipulate the other person. Abuse ALWAYS escalates if permitted to continue.<br>  When you "meet" anyone online, you are not actually meeting the real person. You are getting the only the information that the person presents, none of which may be true.  A stranger who sounds sympathetic online may be playing you by telling you what you want to hear. In this case, your loneliness was evident and made you vulnerable to manipulation.<br>  The best way to meet a potential boyfriend is at school or through good friends who wouldn't steer you wrong.<br>  "Madly in love"? No. Love is not manipulative. Love is friendship, respect and yes, caring, but not based on care-taking. Love is not an attempt to prey on another's vulnerabilty or weaknesses. Beware a relationship that is begun on a plea for attention or pity.<br>  You are right that you need health and friends and school. If you ever find yourself feeling depressed, anxious or panicked without direct cause, make sure you do tell your mother, a teacher or a guidance counselor. They can help you get treatment. Talking to a professional rather than strangers on the internet is the way to get help.<br>  A good link on the dangers of internet dating, with access to many other links is<br>  <a href="http://wiki.media-culture.org.au/index.php/Online_Dating_-_Dangers" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.media-culture.org.au/index.p...</a><br>  Do be careful in ANY dating situation.

Do not contact him; do not reply <br>      to any of his attempts to contact you.<br>  <br>  You do not have to join him in his fantasy world, if it that is what it is.<br>  I suspect he just wants attention and is "trying out" his manipulation techniques.|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	Okay, have you physically come in contact with this guy?

They prey on young ones like you and yes, they will find ways to manipulate you, even telling you that he is going to kill himself (which in reality, I doubt that is his intention).  What you need to do is tell your mother about this and cut all communications with him.  An adult needs to be aware of this and now is time for you to come clean with your parents.  They will know how best to handle the situation.

ykcgrOBzaa	If you want to lose weight, you don't have to diet or exercise. Exercising makes you feel better about yourself, but it isn't how you lose weight. If anything, you'll gain weight from muscles. You don't have to diet, like eating weird nasty foods either. All you have to do is watch what you eat. You can eat whatever you want, just don't eat a lot. Like if you have a bag of chips, don't eat the whole bag. It's hard at first, but after a couple of days you get used to it and it feels great when you lose weight. While you are doing this, all you have to do is simple excercises like crunches, push-ups, and lunges every day to tighten up your body. I've been doing this and I've lost about 10 pounds over three weeks.

You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless. <br>  <br>  ps- also isagenix helps treat thyroid problems too.|`|EnSJnaHEaa	You can try a Lap band, I too am very overweight, we need to Love ourselves, and start eating right, fruits and veggies, we also need to exercises so we don't get saggie, I too am desperate but our fat isn't going anywhere until we do something about it.

Sino-western medicine joint.<br>  <br>  Then you can loose some weight after your thyroid will be removed.

BIyiOgPYaa	Obviously, you don't know much about this.<br>  Birth control prevents you from having babies, it doesn't kill them when you get pregnant, that's not how it works.<br>  <br>  Birth control WILL NOT kill a baby.<br>  <br>  Birth control basically works two ways:<br>  1) It prevents ovulation, which means you won't release an egg. If you have no eggs to fertilize, then you will have no baby.<br>  2) On the very, very rare chance breakthrough ovulation occurs while on the pill, your cervical mucus will thicken, making it nearly impossible for the egg to implant into your uterus, which means a baby will not be able to grow.<br>  <br>  If you take birth control every day at the same time and have no medications that interfere (such as antibiotics), you will not get pregnant.<br>  <br>  EDIT: No, that's bullsh*t. It's just your period, there's nothing in the birth control pill that would make you miscarry.

6sPcYQr0aa	It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

For example, pear shaped people store excess fat in the hips and thighs, apple in the abdominal area, hourglass generally all over...|`|UWFOtSmnaa	the best way in gaining fats to some areas of your body is exercising. and eat a healthy diet. eat more foods which contain high level of proteins. always go to the gym for proper executing exercises for the best result.

h0oHTKThaa	actually, as far as snack foods go, salsa and tortilla chips are decent. salsa is about the best condiment you can get, it's low calorie and has a bit of heat that's been said to help improve metabolism. <br>  get all natural tortilla chips - they have heart healthy oils (poly/mono unsaturated) that have omega3s or 6s (brain health) and vitamin e (good antioxidant)... as long as you watch your portion size, this makes a good snack. <br>  <br>  <br>  ps-guacamole, in REALLY small amounts, is great for you. avocados are one of the best fats you can get - but you seriously have to watch the portion control cause the calories add up ridiculously fast.|`|8RCANzJvaa	not really.<br>  <br>  if you had ... say... a small serving (approx 15-19 chips with salsa) it would be a hundred to two hundred calories.<br>  <br>  it would be even better if you got whole wheat chips, and the less salt kind.<br>  <br>  but no, overall they arent that healthy.

Also, uncircs have a greater chance of catching disease and transmitting it because bacteria loves to live in the foreskin, which is why the WHO suggested circumcision to fight the AIDS epidemic in Africa. <br>  <br>  Also, circumcised men last longer, so the sex with them is so much better!|`|cFigSdt0aa	Uncircumcised for two reasons: <br>  <br>  1.

Let's have an example.  You could do:<br>  1. leg extensions<br>  2. calf raises<br>  3. leg press<br>  4. etc, etc, etc, to infinity<br>  Or you could do:<br>  1. Squats<br>  To work your hamstrings, quads, calves, glutes (butt), hip flexors, abs, back, and a lot of muscle stabilizers.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the websites below for information on how to do the exercises and a workout program that includes them.  I highly, highly, highly suggest you do either Starting Strength or Stronglifts.  You will develop full body strength.

mEZpqzkMaa	Dont look at your BMI whatever you do. Your bodyfat is far too low if your measurement is accurate. At that percentage you probably aren't mensturating, and your hormone profile is off. your body cannot support life in its current condition which is where the reproductive concern comes from. I would see an endocrinologist if I were you to check hormone levels to ensure safety.|`|xqQO81Omaa	If your body fat really is only 8% then that would be very unhealthy. I hope that it is a misreading, because you'd only have 8.4lb of fat on you!<br>  <br>  Anything under 12%-15% body is too low for a woman; it can cause your menstrual cycle to cease, lead to chronic fatigue syndrome, early onset osteoperosis and a weakened immune system.|`|868TSu7Haa	According to your Body Mass Index You are within in a normal range of weight just don't lose any more weight. Your Body Mass Index is 19.2 and normal range is between 18.5 and 24.9 so your good, and you said you have been a runner all your life so you are probably mainly muscle so I really don't think this is going to effect your reproductive health at all.  So unless your friend is a medical health professional, I would refrain from taking any advice from her.<br>  <br>                                  *~Gorgeous054~*|`|FaVYRoXqaa	That's way too low.

This is nonsense. <br>  <br>  When I was 14 I lost 12 kgs in 3-4 months. Just decrease the amount of food you eat, and what you eat, eat it in small portions of 5-6 meals, a meal per 3 hours. Exclude sweets. Or just a wafel or sth about 40-50 gr per 3 days. Eat much, much fruit. By much I mean, 1,2 kilos of apples, as much as you need, between your otehr meals, whenever you feel hubgry eat fruit to keep you fill. No matter how much fruit and vegetable you eat , you won't gain weight form fruit, so don't worry, It;s like water. <br>  <br>  Also, if you can exercise at home, you can dance, jump rope, make push ups and sit ups, lift weights. If you don't have dumbles, you can lift bottles of water. Full of course. There are plenty of ways to exerise without paying for this;) You can go jogging or at least brisk walk  for an hour guarantees you a good sweating. And, don't pay attentoin to the scales, just to the way you look, I mean, you may gain muscle and become even heavier after hard trainig, but this may mean you've started looking much better, just because you've replaced fat with muscle. And muscle weighs much more. I weigh 76 kilos and I am 172 cm. But people always give me between 63-68 kilos.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	A good diet involves saving money, cut everything in half|`|4bjMB0jfaa	okay so....It depends how old u r.<br>  I'm 16 and I know you have to be 18 or whatever to use Alli<br>  but I did anyways cuz my parents are doctors and they said it was fine.<br>  I lost about 10 pounds in a week and a half. I exercised and ate very little fat. If you eat a lot of fat...u don't want to know. It works very well, but you can't eat more then 15 grams of fat per meal. It's also better if you eat less then 10 if you can. Hope this helps!!!|`|3hmQYGnGaa	I did this and it worked. Eat whatever you eat - only a little less than what you usually eat and make sure you don't stuff yourself. Don't have any snacks and exercise at least 3 or 4 times a week for 30 minutes each time. Trust me, it works! I lost 10 pounds in 1 or 2 weeks. Also make sure you drink a lot of water because water helps clean your body of your waste. Try eating lots of fiber too.

BIyiOgPYaa	When you have your period, blood comes out of your vagina. To stop or trap the blood, you use a pad or a tampon. Pads go in your underwear and soak up the blood that comes out (icky), tampons go inside your vagina to stop the blood from coming out (much more sanitary).|`|6gthdHpnaa	A pad is a soft, absorbent pad, with a sticky back that you stick to your underwear. Some of them have side wings. They absorb the menstrual fluid (looks like blood) that comes out of your vagina when you are on your period. All you do is stick it to your underwear and attach the wings if it has them. You can't flush pads or wrappers down the toilet.<br>  A tampon is a roll of cotton with a string on the end. You put it into your vagina using the applicator. (Detailed instructions can be found on beinggirl.com) Digital tampons are tampons that do not have an applicator, you just put them in with your finger. You should only have a tampon in for 8 hours, no longer. When you want to take it out, just pull on the string. You can flush the tampon down the toilet. You can flush cardboard applicators down the toilet, but not plastic ones. Some tampon wrappers can be flushed, some cannot.<br>  Some other forms of feminine protection:<br>  A pantyliner is a thin pad, usually used on days when your period is light, or to absorb vaginal discharge, or used with a tampon to collect leakage.<br>  A menstrual cup is a reusable cup that you put inside your vagina.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|jWBuMxKzaa	pretty much what sarah said. But I'll explain why its better to eat 3 meals a day. In some cases it could be even more beneficial to eat 5 times a day. The thing about your metabolism is that works depending on what you eat. If you starve yourself by not eating much then your body will then begin storing fats because its fear that you don't have enough food for the day thus it slows down your metabolism to help keep you feed. Now their are certain foods mostly towards veggie area that can take awhile to digest, thus it has ur metabolism working even when ur not eating for a longer time which is good. As for the 5 meals a day, to constantly be eating not big meals but small healthier portions, will continually have it working digesting food almost all day. So it readily gets the the nutrition and throws it all out faster instead of waiting for til ur next meal to digest.|`|8Wxzz0Zraa	Probably not.|`|VFL5P6dAaa	UMMMMMMMM I THINK IT DOES CUS IM 16 AN ABOUT 111 POUNDS I EAT LIKE A FAT KID, BUT I NEVER GROW

W2z5dCrmaa	There are really good antibacterials and anti-fungals over the counter.<br>  One such is polysporin. It comes in a small tube and is like a cream. It is soothing as well. Just put it under the crown of your knob after a gentle wash like like axe. Don't rub your knob at all, just dab your stuff semi dry with a fluffy towel and apply the cream under the crown of you knob and a coating over the knob and slide the foreskin back to cover it.<br>  <br>  This is common, especially with athletes, and usually starts in the groin area between your body skin and thigh. It is like a yeast fungus, and jock itch is another name. It doesn't go away on it's own in the groin or as athletes foot, and needs an anti fungal cream anywhere. Circumcised Dudes can also get this under the crown of their penis from their groin area. It would be a good idea to use the cream in the groin area as well. You could have the cleanest best kept penis on earth, but coming in contact with jock itch or such fungal condition makes you vulnerable. That's whey there are these good products and creams for dealing with it.  <br>  <br>  Don't ever polish on the underside of your foreskin or on your knob like someone suggested. That is the craziest thing and you will do damage to critical nerve endings. Don't keep your foreskin back either with hopes that dryer will fix it, because it won't.... Will just do subtle damage for you.  <br>  <br>  If you have problems like this, it's always good to talk to male pharmacist. There is a huge number of antibacterial and anti fungal creams that are really good.<br>  <br>  It isn't that women pharmacists don't know, but you wouldn't likely ask her!

You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time.

C06lV8LAaa	new doctor definitely.<br>  i seriously doubt patients should bleed during procedures like that.<br>  She could do serious damage to your insides! D:<br>  <br>  im sorry about your experience too! Thats sounds so traumatizing!|`|BIyiOgPYaa	If you don't like her then don't go back.<br>  It's that simple.|`|kvCa4xCmaa	go to a different doctor! there shouldn't be any previous supplies in the room and it shouldn't hurt that much0 especially if you have had to previous pain-less exams. I have never bleed during an exam and I really don't think you should. Go to a different doctor!|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I have had pelvic exams for over 35 years and never had that kind of inconsiderate pain.  Find a new gyno.  Some of these doctors overbook their time to make more money and don't have the time to be careful of your feelings.  Go doctor hunting.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|owjZhOOhaa	if you felt uncomfortable than i advise you to go ahead and go to another gyno
6sPcYQr0aa	It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.
TUSNeUCcaa	Well there's only one way to find out & that is to take a Pregnancy Test! If the Condom broke during Sex then maybe you are Pregnant But because of the stress on your body due to the Surgery it may just be that It's no use freakin out until you know for sure|`|IARYnu6zaa	If you used a condom its more likely to be related to the surgery.<br>  Give it another week or so and if you still haven't started go talk to a doctor about the surgery and ask if that could be a problem then if still not started, take a test.|`|Rbm99GOcaa	I am sure since you used a condom (correctly) that it is probably because of the surgery. My cousin had the same surgery and it took her a while before she got back on her usual schedule. I would suggest that you go and take a home pregnancy test (you can get them at any drug store)<br>  <br>  PS good luck!|`|Ho3QwxrHaa	first thing you should do is take a test but its probably nothing because im always on time too but sometimes when my cycle is changing i get it a couple of day to a week late.<br>  <br>  just take a test but i don't think that you are.

bouDIMjmaa	aids|`|1t552048aa	umm... This is going to seem wierd but check your doctor for Hemophelia. If you have suffered things like this from the past then you have it, seeing as it is a genetic disease. Since it is genetic look into researching your family tree and see if they had chronic conditions like this.
a9544cd33f55c23a0ffdea942524b72aaa	To be completely honest you can weigh anywhere from 90-130 lbs and be considered healthy for your age and height. However, the average for your height is around 110-120. Weight is too much of a touchy subject, but health is so much more important.
LJf5rklZaa	too many on the market and they all work different for different people.  the most common low end is tribulus.  it isnt too expensive and helps your body produce a bit more testosterone.|`|pIgSS5Nqaa	real testosterone is called steroids and they are not illegal if prescribed by a doctor.

Regular exercise, if not overdone, improves your immune system which indirectly reduces cancer risk and colds/flu, etc.  Fit people tend to be happier, healthier and live longer.<br>  <br>  You should look at what lack of exercise and obesity do to impact life span -- e.g. depression, lack of energy, high risk of heart disease, artherosclerosis, cancer, social anxiety disorder.....the list is nearly endless.  By staying fit you can avoid most of these life shorteners.
7iZzm3owaa	Sweetie, go back and read what you just wrote. You said that some people tell you that you're fat, and some people tell you that you're thin. Translation: You're just right! :-) At your height, your weight is just perfect. Every girl needs a little bit of "padding" on her body in order to produce the right curves. If you lose any weight, you'll also lose all of those good curves. And trust me, when you start dating you'll find out that the guys love curves! So hang in there, and ignore all those people who are telling you that you're fat.|`|RXr0iY0Xaa	You are NOT fat. I believe when you have rolls hanging over your pants when you are standing and you are out of breath when walking, then you are overweight. You are twelve and puberty is talking over your body. Eventually you will grow into your weight. 130lbs is not fat. Play a sport or two if YOU think different. As long as you remain active, you will be just fine. Do not listen to people telling you are fat. Become comfortable with your own body and don't let someone else determine that for you.|`|O6dg37RPaa	Actually your the perfect weight for someone your height. As long as your happy with your weight, you shouldn't worry about what other people think.|`|pzcH9RI4aa	it doesnt madder wat other people think dont let wat people think about you controle your life. your fine just the way you are.|`|P6DSmK8vaa	why is your screen name soccermom if your only 12!?!?!?are you trash talking about your daughter!!you probably need to loose weight fatty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NX4LYXkqaa	As you are young it is alright|`|1XxVxFikaa	when i was12 i was fat,i weighed 165 pounds and i hated it!i tryed yoga and it worked!now im 13 and i weigh 112 and im 5'9.
Fuej6dMPaa	You need to have someone measure you. you can't accurately measure yourself. And it is best to get measure by the store you are buying the bra from. Different bra brands make their sizes differently so you could be one size in victoria's secret and a totally different size in a macys store.
fOfqPATaaa	everyone experiences this and it's because of they foods and drinks we consume through out the day.  I was reading about it in glamor magazine about a year ago that the average person gains about five pounds through out the day and will lose it all by the time they wake up the next morning.  I personally gain about three pounds through out the day usually.<br>  Hope I helped =)|`|r1fLDlhCaa	because a scale weighs everything you ate and drank that day, and its all in your stomach, but when you sleep your body digests it|`|9BNHNcDbaa	me too!!! i can gain/ loose 6 pounds in a day but i always go back to the same number in the morning.  It is water and food weight, after a big drink or meal i gain a few pounds but after the bathroom i go back down, i dont know ecatly why but yeah|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.
KUhZX3Hbaa	I LOOOOVE it when a guy "bottoms out" in me!|`|46d62da2d3dd3a53d1918e33824bbb8daa	well i think girls don't care so much on how long the penis as mush as they care how wide a wide penis is. i think every girls thoughts are different but that's what a lot think and its just misunderstood. my bf is huge n gosh i feel it after wards i wouldn't mind a smaller lol but i still love him :)|`|9PqAOQu1aa	So you really know the expression, "Tap that until the bottom falls out."|`|XsmPnMU4aa	As a Verchyna expert I know that women love a large as in thick man meat. As a man who has a very large man meat I can tell you women can handle them.<br>  <br>  You must have a very small man meat.|`|Tj2xROpwaa	well personally i want a thick one. as long as it hits the bottom i'm fine with it. but also mine is deep and tight. wow i feel like a ho|`|BL4OBp0eaa	i know what you mean, but some girls when they say big mean thickness not longness. it really hurts when its just really long!! lol but yeah|`|brvOa9QYaa	Its proven that penis size doesnt make a difference unless it is extremely small or too large. so its cac. <br>  I dont know why girls would do it.|`|tsdLrJORaa	A.  Most girls don't talk about wanting an oversized one. Girls with experience know that average/normal hurts enough. It is GUYS who are constantly talking about penis length.<br>  <br>  B. Even though an average penis can hit the bottom, it could still push deeper (because the vagina is stretchy) if it were longer.<br>  <br>  C. On average, a vagina is 5-7 inches when aroused but you can push a maximum of 7-10 inches into it. Most women say anything more than 8.5 inches is way too painful.<br>  <br>  P.S.  MMMM, I don't think you'd know what "big" man meat is if it hit you upside the head. Let's hear some statistics.|`|1wXx8tkVaa	What are you talking about ? You could drive a train right up mine! Nothing is too big for this verchinya. As we speak, I have a dozen eggs up there, trying to keep them warm and damp till they're ready to be cooked.|`|WMc3UIXsaa	wow.<br>  maybe you should stop whining and be glad that you're getting some.<br>  big cocks fxcking hurt, im not gonna lie. my boyfriend is huge.<br>  so maybe you should put yourself in the girl's position for like... two seconds.|`|pa8vbP5taa	I suggest you read this article<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.fucktube.com/is-there-an-optimal-penis-size/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.fucktube.com/is-there-an-opt...</a>|`|GtPnXzPAaa	I don't want it large, it want it   W    I    D    E.|`|Zjgmm9t5aa	I love a nice fat one up the ***|`|k6cXOxvtaa	my vag is only 2 inches deep

WeNWlYT4aa	Yes. Practice it a lot, even if it mean more intercourse.|`|AA10988719	kegels are ok to do when you are urinating, having sex, or just sitting at your desk at work.  Although I do not know of them personally, apparently there are devices you can buy to assist you in the process, and don't try to write them off as exercise equipment on your income taxes ;)  In addition to kegels there are some natural remedies to make your vagina tighter.  this is an interesting article that gives you the names of specific ingredients to look for in products so you don't waste time and money on crap that won't work.|`|mMGQCGMsaa	Yes it is.  I saw a pelvic floor rehab therapist because of pain during intercourse, and she helped me with a lot of things.  One of the things she taught me was that doing kegels during intercourse can help you to orgasm.|`|ZAz1J1xUaa	Yes! It improves sexual function. It increase pelvic muscle strength and tone. It has also a good effect during pregnancy and post pregnancy.|`|9a78f2ed3b9169e0997245e3910a9c35aa	yes, and im sure he'll appreciate it!!!

YRJShhKraa	I am a former anorexia sufferer, and always find it hardest when I get the flu and lose a lot of weight. The good thing is you are still at a healthy weight, so there is no need to gain unless you would like. I would suggest to stick to the B.R.A.T. (banana, rice, applesauce, toast) diet for a few days until you feel better, and then slowly start adding foods that you normally eat into your diet. The ultimate goal being to get back to the amount you were eating before you got sick. Hope you feel better! Hope this helps! =)|`|r1fLDlhCaa	just try to eat, thats what i do, i was sick last week and lost ten pounds as well haha just eat little things as often as you can keep it down (i went my first like four  days eating ice cubes cause i couldent keep anything down) but as soon as you can just eat little bits of this and that

9pLdhuBnaa	This blood could be an indication that your body is getting ready for your period (an example only).  Also, sometimes with the activity bleeding can occur on a light level when it comes to intensity.<br>  <br>  However, I would recommend seeing a doctor for further evaluation of the situation.  Due to the financial situation I would recommend checking with your city health department to see if they offer a free health clinic that can evaluate this further for you.
iFAlZfVMaa	i've never heard of or seen that as part of any attention issues.... <br>  <br>  it might be a sign of stress, particularly in a young child.... but for the most part, I'd look for more details and a good pediatrician or doctor who specializes in a range of developmental or psychological disorders, depending on the age of the  person in question|`|mAI6TAgiaa	Many people flap on the autism spectrum in varied ways, usually a stress release... and yes some of us with aspergers do also. Just like anyone as we grow up, we learn to adapt/ change and so often if we do as a child less obvious as an adult, or do nt do in front of others.... but flapping can just be shaking hands with excitement "overloading", the description below as good as any:<br>  <br>  Stimming is a jargon term for a particular form of stereotype, a repetitive body movement (often done unconsciously) that self-stimulates one or more senses in a regulated manner. It is shorthand for self-stimulation, and a stereotypy is referred to as stimming under the hypothesis that it has a function related to sensory input.[1] Stereotypy is one of the symptoms listed by the DSM IV for autism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimming" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimming</a>

1UID5JtNaa	Patty- you are not alone- but the good news is you can make the changes you need to- you must start or something- it may be slow at first and you may be embarrassed but you have to just get out the door and start walking.  You also need to take a hard look at your diet.  Believe it or not, it's not that difficult to eat healthy.  I suggest following my Lose It For Ever Scorecard.  For example, 2 fruits, 3 vegetables, 2 snacks a day, breakfast at home, protein, < 12 oz soda or other sweetened drinks a day, etc.   Take a look.  This is not a gimmick-|`|5JT3XyWAaa	....you shouldn`t feel bad about yourself....i`m sure everyone has something about their body they would like to change.....and, i`m one of them, so don`t be ashamed. if people talk about you....talk about them as well. you should be proud of the way you look, and, if you take up for yourself, they`ll see that you are, and probably leave you alone. but, if you really want to change your body, you should just excercize (but, don`t starve yourself...that`s unhaelthy, and you could do more harm than good) and reduce the amount of calories you eat in a day. but, only sparringly....a bit at a time. though, you should still eat a good amount.|`|xZ3rZbshaa	Well, for starters ignore what kids at school say about you. As for your weight all you have to do is watch what you eat(no sugar and lots of veggies and fruits), exercise everyday(walking and running will do), and drink lots of water. One thing for certain DON'T take ANY pills that make you lose weight. Cause trust me it's better to lose it naturally then through pills.|`|QovnMnbNaa	yeah? what am i supposed to do about it?|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Here are some sensible guidelines for healthy weight management:<br>  <br>  Have your child participate in daily vigorous physical activity, sufficient to increase his heart rate and make him sweat. He should start with at least 15 minutes daily and increase to at least 30 minutes. He can try fast walking, jogging, bicycling and skating. Team sports are fun, but not all are vigorous enough to be sufficient alone for weight management.<br>  Monitor your child's diet by writing down what he eats and drinks. Review this record each day, and find foods that he could eliminate by substituting healthier, lower-fat, lower-calorie choices. Do not rely on "diet foods" alone, but rather switch to leaner cuts of meat, poultry, fish, lower-fat cheeses and nonfat milk. Add more vegetables and fiber to his diet, and use fruits as desserts rather than cake, pie, cookies, pudding and ice cream. Watch the size of each serving, and avoid second helpings.<br>  If weight loss is the goal, set reasonable weight-loss targets (usually no more than one-half to 1 pound of lost weight per week), and monitor your child's progress. Periodically use rewards for achieving short-term goals. Do not use a long-term goal of a large amount of weight loss as the only criterion for success.<br>  Support your child's efforts by eliminating undesirable foods from the household. "Cleaning up" the food environment is critical. Keeping high-calorie foods in the house for special occasions or for other family members is cruel and will undermine the child's efforts. There is no acceptable reason for breaking this rule.<br>  As a parent, you are not the "food police," and thus you should not remind, cajole or scold. If you yourself practice healthier habits and keep undesirable foods out of the house, you need only provide praise to your child, not negative reinforcement.

omfxPGyraa	I got rid of mine by drinking practically only water when I was thirsty instead of soda, and sugar drinks, cutting out the fried foods, keeping my face clean, and stop popping the ones you have.  If I even think about eating a piece of friend fish, or even chicken, I get a pimple.  Cut as much sugar as you can (which is easily disguised in beverages), and reduce your fat intake.  It took about 6 weeks but, after that it was smooth sailing.  Popping them exacerbates the problem, and puts dirt on your face.  Keep your hands and other objects out of your face at all times (don't even rest your face on your hands!), stop using acne treatments cause they are harsh and don't work, and change your pillowcase frequently.

AA11639059	Although I don't see it now, years ago I saw a book where the U.S. War department (as they called it then) Scrutinized a team of volunteers to see what the effects of deprivation were in order to understand what Americans held by Axis forces in WWII would be facing.<br>  <br>  As I recall, fat people were often ill-equipped to handle extended starvation. Those that were fared better than skinny people.<br>  <br>  The complication centers around the starvation metabolic mode. <br>  <br>  The body first burns protein, so muscle mass was most diminished early. While fat people had more caloric reserve they found themselves with heart problems (the heart is a muscle too) and fat people are often fat because they don't move around as much. In the starvation situation, with muscle being disassembled to burn for fuel, the "use it or lose it" factor comes to play.<br>  <br>  Skinny people tend to use their muscles more. Since the muscles were in use, the body goes to fat stores before taking working muscles away. Skinny people actually tend to lose fat faster than fat people because of the activity levels (hence we say that exercise is a necessary component of dieting).<br>  <br>  The formerly fat people had to be removed from the study relatively early. Often fat people are facing emotional issues and starvation was a tremendous stressor (and especially if you have a weakened heart). <br>  <br>  Now if a body has had to repeatedly endure the feast and famine cycles, then tanking up on animal fats in winter and burning it off in the work of spring and summer, vegging out on the produce of late summer and early autumn, such as in agrarian societies, that is different.<br>  <br>  Then there is the notion of minimal nutrition, especially for the elderly. Once the body metabolism has clicked onto the starvation mode, a slender elderly person can live a surprisingly long time on a little food.<br>  <br>  Fat persons trying this, however, have the complications of chemistry associated with fats. Some of this chemistry includes (but is not limited to) the common cholesterol issue. So a minimal diet (often described as less than the 1000 to 900 calorie intake range) has complications for a fat old person that a skinny old person doesn't face. I heard this described in the nursing home when my grandmother's third husband was dying (she outlived all three). The doctor was telling some family members that if he had been fat, the complications of the wasting from Alzheimer's would have killed him long ago, but since he was slender it took longer for the wasting to take him.|`|d08rkYlpaa	Yes, but they die of thirst at about the same rate. <br>  Fasting (going completely without food) is a bad way to lose weight, because your fat doesn't contain the vitamins and minerals you need to stay healthy, or the bulk your digestive system needs.<br>  In Nazi Germany in the concentration camp where the prisoners simply were not fed more than a few scraps and water during WWII, being fat prior to incarceration was not a guarantee of surviving longer for those reasons.<br>  Your second question is also interesting in this way; if a fat person and a thinner person ate equal small amounts (rather than nothing at all) the fat person would lose weight slower than the thin person. This is because the factors that made him fat in the first place would still be operating - less exercise, slower metabolism, and less muscle mass which burns through energy at a higher rate. But if the two lost weight through exercise rather than diet alone, the fat person would lose weight faster, simply because carrying around the extra weight is harder work.|`|rff71wi4aa	i dont think so, wouldnt they die just as fast becuase they get hungry more quickly and that would make their heart pump faster and BAM! their dead|`|Wo5mIzRbaa	The most effective way to burn fat is to consume less and workout more often, the difficulties surface when we really try to put that into operation!

This obviously leads to a lack of motivation and drive and is a big contributor to why so many positive lifestyle changes go flying out of the window the moment the going gets tough.<br>  here is a few suggestion for you<br>  <br>  Mindset: You have to realise that these things happen, and it is from your mistakes and challenges that you learn the most about yourself. If you can switch to this mindset then you are half way there<br>  <br>  Learn from Your Mistakes: Everything happens for a reason. You can never be 100% perfect – and nobody is. No matter what they say. We all have moments of weakness and we all have the opportunity to either make the same mistakes over and over or we can learn from our mistakes, improve ourselves and move on.<br>  <br>  Assess, Rewrite and Reaffirm your Goals: If you were not doing this on a regular basis before then you should start doing it now. If you didn’t have a written set of specific, measurable short, medium and long-term goals then you definitely need to do that now. There are hundreds of other goal and motivation techniques that you can also use to give yourself a boost.<br>  <br>  ok maybe this thing will help you out,goddluck..|`|szE6NtO5aa	Hmm...what kind of diet are you doing? maybe it is unreasonably restrictive? I find I have the most success when I look at the food I am eating in a positive light. For example, I never tell myself I can't have french fries. I always approach it from the angle that I can eat all the fries I want, but because I value my body I choose not to. And I don't HAVE to eat healthy foods. I enjoy healthy foods because they make me feel good, and they are tasty! As soon as I turn food into a negative thing, it becomes an issue and I am miserable. Focus on all the foods you can eat that you enjoy and you might feel better about what you are doing. |`|824c44a040458a609cb154ccfffb9d7caa	think that if you don't do it , you will surely get some cancer or some dreadful disease that will suck you up dry financially or torture you when your old until you die.|`|yVhzA2Kxaa	the first answer should be best

It's not uncommon for you to see pus.  I know someone who had gall bladder surgery and there was seepage and puss coming out of the poke holes three months after surgery.  Some people heal slowly.  But to be on the safe side, call the surgeon's office and ask to speak to a nurse first and if you aren't happy with what she/he says, then ask to speak to the surgeon directly.  It's always wise to let them know how you are doing.<br>  <br>  As for you not doing your homework, that doesn't apply to you.  It's the surgeon and the nurses who should have told you the things to expect after a medical procedure.

31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	Bipolar Disorder is the same as Manic Depressive.  It is one of the most abused diagnoses in the business of psychology and psychiatry.  The specific requirements for a proper diagnosis are found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV.  I would suggest that you read that.  for the most part, however, it is manifested by a cycling between depression and mania and the severity of it is determined by how rapid that cycling is.  <br>  <br>  You brain has a normal cycling between being somewhat depressed and somewhat manically excited, it is when this happens on a frequent basic with the depressive moods going toward being suicidal and the manic moods being like you are about to jump through heaven's gate.  <br>  <br>  To be diagnosed properly, the items in the DSM have to be seen.  That would mean that a properly qualified psychologist (and not all are properly qualified) would have to SEE the client go through cycling modes, not just hear the client tell that he has had ups and downs.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  I was diagnosed with Bipolar for a while, but the problem was that I never saw a HIGH and the psychologist never saw me with one either.  I had major depression, no mania.  <br>  <br>  I would say that most diagnoses are ill founded|`|84xntgdTaa	Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, and ability to function. Different from the normal ups and downs that everyone goes through, the symptoms of bipolar disorder are severe. They can result in damaged relationships, poor job or school performance, and even suicide. But there is good news: bipolar disorder can be treated, and people with this illness can lead full and productive lives.<br>  <br>  About 5.7 million American adults or about 2.6 percent of the population age 18 and older in any given year,1 have bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder typically develops in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, some people have their first symptoms during childhood, and some develop them late in life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people may suffer for years before it is properly diagnosed and treated. Like diabetes or heart disease, bipolar disorder is a long-term illness that must be carefully managed throughout a person’s life.<br>  <br>  |`|mKP1mjS3aa	Bipolar disorder is also known as manic-depression or manic-depressive illness — manic behavior is one extreme of this disorder, and depression is the other.<br>  <br>  The deep mood swings of bipolar disorder may last for weeks or months, causing great disturbances in the lives of those affected, and those of family and friends, too. Today, a growing volume of research suggests that bipolar disorder occurs across a spectrum of symptoms, and that many people aren't correctly diagnosed. Left untreated, bipolar disorder generally worsens, and the suicide rate is high among those with bipolar disorder. But with effective treatment, you can live an enjoyable and productive life despite bipolar disorder. <br>  <br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  Bipolar disorder symptoms are characterized by an alternating pattern of emotional highs (mania) and lows (depression). The intensity of signs and symptoms can vary from mild to severe. There may even be periods when your life doesn't seem affected at all. <br>  <br>  Manic phase of bipolar disorder<br>  Signs and symptoms of the manic phase of bipolar disorder may include:<br>  <br>      * Euphoria<br>      * Extreme optimism<br>      * Inflated self-esteem<br>      * Poor judgment<br>      * Rapid speech<br>      * Racing thoughts<br>      * Aggressive behavior<br>      * Agitation<br>      * Increased physical activity<br>      * Risky behavior<br>      * Spending sprees<br>      * Increased drive to perform or achieve goals<br>      * Increased sexual drive<br>      * Decreased need for sleep<br>      * Tendency to be easily distracted<br>      * Inability to concentrate<br>      * Drug abuse<br>  <br>  Depressive phase of bipolar disorder<br>  Signs and symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder may include:<br>  <br>      * Sadness<br>      * Hopelessness<br>      * Suicidal thoughts or behavior<br>      * Anxiety<br>      * Guilt<br>      * Sleep problems<br>      * Appetite problems<br>      * Fatigue<br>      * Loss of interest in daily activities<br>      * Problems concentrating<br>      * Irritability<br>      * Chronic pain without a known cause<br>  <br>  Types of bipolar disorder<br>  Bipolar disorder is divided into two main subtypes:<br>  <br>      * Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode, with or without previous episodes of depression.<br>      * Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one episode of depression and at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is similar to a manic episode but much briefer, lasting only a few days, and not as severe. With hypomania, you may have an elevated mood, irritability and some changes in your functioning, but generally you can carry on with your normal daily routine and functioning, and you don't require hospitalization. In bipolar II disorder, the periods of depression are typically much longer than the periods of hypomania.<br>      * Cyclothymia. Cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder. Cyclothymia includes mood swings but the highs and lows are not as severe as those of full-blown bipolar disorder.<br>  |`|kOrErZvcaa	Bi-polar disorder used to be known as manic/depressive disorder.  A person, when not in a normal state is either incredibly euphoric, energized, doesn't sleep, is impulsive, takes risks they other wise wouldn't take (sexually, driving, with money etc).  or they are in a depressed state.  You can learn a lot about bi-polar disorder from a website called NAMI.

il9Tdmchaa	Your decision to see a therapist is to be commended. You needed a lot of strength and courage to make that decision. When you see the therapist they'll want a background of you and your experiences. They will ask about what you went through but keep being strong and tell them everything, that's the only way they can help. The amount of times you go depends on you and your therapist. (If you don't feel comfortable with this therapist then try another one until you find one you trust and can open up to.) Each session will be different and they don't always ask the same questions. My therapist lets me start the conversation and we go from there. Stay strong and courageous you're definitely on the right track.

That is the great thing about smoking weed, you cant overdose from it. But depending on what kind of weed you smoke and how much you smoke will it wear off in about an hour. The worst thing that can happen to you if you smoke too much weed is you'll cough and if you smoke a lot you'll pass out. And next thing you know your counting the tiles on the ceiling. As for the side effects is it can cause short term memory loss. If your smoking the good stuff you'll feel like your in a dream, you'll feel like your floating and a lot of times you'll start talking reaaallly slooowww. But you can actually control yourself more than as if you were drunk. but if your drinking and smoking that is when the stuff really takes effect. But i've heard of some people saying that they didnt even get that high the first time they smoked. Not me. If I had it my way alchohol would be illeagal and weed would be legal.

Why not take advice from somebody whos been doing it for 10 year. FIRST the only reason its illegal is because of tobacco and alcohol companies paying to keep it illegal because if it were legal it would cut into there profits big time. SECOND google marijuana deaths, nobody i repeatttttttt nobody has died from it. It does not CAUSE LUNG CANCER no test has shown it does so dont worry. Third you cannot Overdose from it so in a way it is much safer to smoke weeed with a back ache than take tylonal, 2000 deaths every year from tylenol. Just make sure the weed is not laced with any other drugs and it will wear off probaley in 2 hours.

Stress causes the immune system to go into overdrive, and ours is already there!<br>  <br>  Creatine and bun are definitely things to be concerned about. 40% of us get lupus nephritis. Insist that the doctor pay attention to this. It's your body!!!!!<br>  <br>  C reactive protein is an inflammation marker. Inflammation means there is lupus activity going on.

Your language comprehension isn't normal. <br>  Hairy part=pubic hair or "happy trail" <br>  Bone part=pelvis and pubic bone<br>  Pee hole=urethral opening<br>  <br>  If you touch your vagina (the outside of the vagina includes the clitoris), it's probably masturbation. You can stroke your body as part of the act of masturbation. Most women do not involve penetration when masturbating because you don't have that many nerve endings in your vagina, it's more psychological.<br>  <br>  Nothing should come out of your vagina right away, though you should have a lot of self-lubrication from arousal down there. Are you talking about female ejaculation? That's assumed to spray from the urethral opening, not the vagina. Do you have an orgasm when you do this?|`|XqAfAWmoaa	masturbation? yes. normal? yes.<br>  <br>  don't worry about it, it's you,<br>  and its no one else's business what you do with yourself.|`|sbU9FBgkaa	Course your normal (:<br>  And if u enjoy it then its masterbation but theres nothing wrong with it x

Don't do any intense activity if you take them as you will be dehydrated.|`|Kk6wAZDtaa	Hmm, I'm not sure. I would recommend eating though... That is if you were planning to go 3 days without eating. I do know that once one becomes lets say: anerxic (i think thats how you spell it.. :/ ) they tend to become so hungry to the point when they do eat, they can't stop. Or they end up gaining the weight back. It's a very unhealthy disorder that no body should try even if they think they look 'fat'. They really don't. Try googling your question, your bound to find an appropiate answer. : )|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	That's just a bad idea and it's not going to get you<br>  anywhere.<br>  <br>  If you do lose weight you'll probably to tired and<br>  miserable to notice at the end of that 3 days.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	Not much, your body will begin to store up fat if you stop eating. How about eating right and exercising instead of trying lose weight the lazy way?|`|yFX0mdOhaa	It would depend on your size.  You could probably lose 5-10 lbs, but a lot of it would just be from dehydration and all of the food purged from your system.  Legitamately, you could lose maybe 1-2 lbs of fat.  <br>  <br>  Like others have said... not really healthy, and you could get very sick.  You would feel like such crap, that it wouldn't be worth it.  By the time you did eat on the 4th day, you would gain most of the weight back, if not all of it.|`|ucYbUqTQaa	It depends on how many calories you would burn. Simply not doing anything will cause you not to lose any calories. So, don't ever skip a meal, simply do more cardiovascular exercises. However, never forget to talk to Doctor if you're healthy for exercise.|`|1JY3GY41aa	virtually nothing, your metabolism would slow down so dramatically that you would barely burn any calories at all. but if you exercise and are anorexic thats a different story. the exercising will keep your metabolism going.|`|SR04mlQQaa	I do it every weekend.

Constant pain and you wouldn't lose a pound really that's not just water weight. Also it would harm your metabolism and you would start gaining weight when you did start eating again and might even get fat... so I wouldn't do this at all.|`|AzkEtvdcaa	Maybe a few pounds. I would not advise doing this, during the time you don't eat, your stomach will shrink and when you do eat your body will turn it into fat in order to store it because you haven't been eating properly for three days and it doesn't know when you next will to be blunt. Try excersizing and eating the foods you like in smaller proportions.|`|dX97ZgAHaa	You will get your body in all sorts of trouble if you start to starve yourself.<br>  If you just eat a sensible diet you wont need to diet.<br>  You would lose a lot of water in first few days, which would make you feel like you had lost weight, but it will all go back on once you drink and eat again.<br>  Please dont stop eating if that is your plan!|`|D9nPc2X1aa	well it depend on how much you exercise.

It can KILL you!|`|WKxi3gWBaa	try eating a small small plate of food a day.. like a small salad and small oven baked chicken breast a day... then the next eat a yogurt and a small salad .. do that a few days.. you could lose 8 pounds in a week. i did|`|1da4ddb0b32e38994b79631ed4df2811aa	Well i'm not sure how much you might loose, since it depends on your body<br>  but its a BAD idea.<br>  Seriously, it's really unhealthy and your gonna be really weak and have NO energy at all.|`|FwdBKodSaa	You can get seriously ill.

My mom and sisters have done the master cleanse diet occasionally and it is great for cleaning out your system, giving your digestive system a break and loosing excess weight. I tried it once to clean out my system but I stopped after three days (it's meant to be 10) when I realized I couldn't afford to lose any weight (I did not do it to lose weight). <br>  You have to know what you're doing though and do it properly, that means following a proper fasting plan (which usually means gradually decreasing and then increasing your food intake). Make sure you stay well hydrated (with electrolytes). And most importantly, listen to your body and if you don't feel well stop.<br>   <br>  Fasting is about, cleaning, resting and refreshing your body (which also means no exercise while you fast), not abusing and neglecting it. So if you're just trying to look like nicole richie at any cost, forget about it.|`|bk4CeRvNaa	its very unhealthy to not eat. you actually get bigger.<br>  Eat a healthy breakfast, like 2 eggs and a glass of milk or cereal with milk. then for lunch eat a cereal bar along with something to drink.<br>  for dinner you can eat something small. and drink a lot of water to control the acidity in your stomach. you'll lose a lot of weight.|`|1eouzAd1aa	Its not what you loose over the three days but the fact that you starved your body and when you do eat every calorie will be horded by your body. Don't starve yourself, not wise just eat less calories so that your body can have some cals to get rid of the fat that your trying to get rid of. I mean if your really adamant on loosing a certain amount of weight then look into a diet that give you less calories. Look for the heart healthy diet its what they call a scam diet but to loose a quick 10lbs it works, and you don't starve your body.|`|BY9DNbuEaa	You wouldnt lose anything, you would probably gain weight due to the fact that our bodies need to digest food. If you dont eat for 3 days your body will store off on the fat you have and causes you to gain weight. If your trying to lose weight, try exerscing and eating small portions of food every 2-3 hours|`|w2v0Cg5Faa	Well, you might lose some weight, but you would mostly lose water and you wouldn't be losing very much fat. You also wouldn't be able to keep it up after a few days and your body would want to compensate for not eating and so you'd probably end up eating more after those 3 days had passed (so any weight loss would be temporary). <br>  <br>  If you stop eating for longer than a few days, or just eat very very little for more than a few days, then you have an eating disorder called anorexia, which can have terrible effects on your body and many people die from anorexia, so if you feel like you want to stop eating because you don't like the way you look, you should talk to someone like a parent or a counselor about the way you feel and they can help you lose weight in a permanent and healthy fashion. <br>  <br>  If you really want to lose weight, you should try a more structured program like weight watchers, or if you are broke like me, there are free websites you can join that will help you. I like the dailyplate.com, where you can type in how much you weigh and it will tell you how many calories you should eat to lose however many pounds a week, and then you can type in what you've eaten and it will calculate how many calories it is.|`|NBT5PoRVaa	when i got the flu i couldn't hold anything down for about three days.

3SNhXpf0aa	Eat a healthy diet. Go to the gym. Eat 1800-2000 calories a day, and do exercise, this will put you in a calorie deficit, and you will be on your way to weight loss.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	if exercising is not an option then consider making an adjustment to your diet. I’m not talking about just changing what you eat, but also change your eating habits. In some cases, the way you eat: the size of your meals, the time of day in which you eat certain food groups, the time between meals, and the number of meals you eat each day, can have a bigger effect on your weight than the amount of calories that you consume.<br>  <br>  a possible weight loss method for you to use is Calorie Shifting. <br>  <br>  Here are the basic principles of Calorie Shifting<br>  1. You eat 4 reasonable sized meals each day based on a specific and personal menu.<br>  2. These 4 meals contain all food groups (carbs, protein, fat).<br>  3. You need to eat the meals at least 2.5 hours apart so they’re spaced out throughout the day.<br>  The menu spreads the 4 meals throughout the day which causes a metabolic effect which maintains the rate in which your metabolism runs. This causes your body to burn calories faster than it does with other diets.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/2009/01/calorie-shifting.html" rel="nofollow">http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/2...</a>|`|NPMKqJlMaa	watch ur diet... no junk **** and high proteins, eat multivitamins, fruits, drink plenty water<br>  and esp. eat every 2 to 3 hours to boost up ur metabolism. stay away from fat... instead eat omega 369, u can get dem in fishs or in tablets frm ur local pharmacy|`|YI9d2k6Iaa	Here is where you can read a good article called "Top Ten Principles and Tips for Weight Loss"  <br>  <a href="http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weightloss_tips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weig...</a><br>  They are good tips that work.|`|61e53bb91485a8bd3c6701d7a90c4da2aa	Cut out calories instead of food and drink MORE water

tluT02tvaa	I don't know if they let children your age do Yoga.And I don't feel comfortable giving you addresses to go places where you might get hurt,or aren't supervised by a parent or adult.So your best bet is buy or rent,or youtube some Yoga excersizes you can do at home.<br>  You don't need tons of space,and you can do it in your room.<br>  Lay a mat or towel on the floor and start out with some beginner moves,and breathing patterns.When you get older you can get a membership to Bally's total fitness or something,they have regular Yoga classes there every day,but I think you need to be at least 18 years of age to join.Good luck

mMGQCGMsaa	Could be endometriosis or ovarian cysts.  Nothing will help like the birth control pill.  You will feel so much better.  I'm glad you are seeing a doctor.  They really should do a laparoscopy and check for endometriosis.  I have only minimal endo, and before I got on the pill I would hurt so bad that I could stand up.  I hope things get better for you.  I think the pill will make a huge difference in your life.  Set your alarm on your cell ph if you have one, and make sure you take it at the exact same time every day - other wise it will cause breakthrough bleeding - if I take mine even an hour off it causes me to bleed.  Blessings.<br>  <br>  Btw, the pain medicine works much better if you start taking it 3 to 5 days prior to your period starting.  My gyn told me that taking ibuprofen this way will lower the hormones in your blood that cause cramping in advance, thus warding off some of the pain before it even starts.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Ooo- salt on a hemorrhoid.  No wonder you are in so much pain.  Okay- first you are obviously really constipated.  So you will need to attack two troubles at the same time.  I suggest you get an enema- Fleets is the most common brand, sold in drugstores and grocery stores all over the place.  One will be all you need.  While you are there, you need a drinkable fiber mix, and a stool softener, a container of Tucks hemorrhoidal pads, hemorrhoidal suppositories, baby wipes with aloe and no scent, and a couple bottles of witch hazel.  When you get home, put the Tucks in the fridge.  Use one of the hemorrhoidal suppositories, you know where- to numb matters a bit.  After about half an hour, use your enema.  While waiting for that to work, have a glass of the fiber drink mix.  After the enema works, clean yourself with the baby wipes, and apply one of the nice cold Tucks pads right to the hot spot.  It will feel really, really good.  Fill your tub with coolish/warm water, and pour in a generous amount of the witch hazel, and soak your nether parts in that.  It will also feel good.  Use the Tuck's pads every time you go to the bathroom, as well as the hemorrhoidal cream or suppositories, and use baby wipes for personal cleaning instead of dry paper.  Have a glass of that fiber drink mix every morning.  For the next few days, you will also want to add a stool softener, so things are soft and easy to pass.  Take your time in the little reading room, and whatever you do, don't strain at all.  You can soak your tush as often as you like, really- but use witch hazel and not salt.  If you put the hemorrhoidal cream/suppositories in the fridge, as well as the Tucks pads, they will feel even better.  Now, you got into this situation because of your diet and lifestyle.  You need to eat more veggies, salads, fruits, and wholegrains.  You need to eat much less red meat and white bread.  And you need more water in you as well.  You have to make the diet changes so the material in the colon moves along regularly, and you don't get constipated.  That means you need fiber in your diet.  The fiber drink will help some, but you also need fiber from your fruit and veggies, and eat the skins on them.   Whole grain foods provide fiber too, so it's oatmeal and whole wheat bread you need- not the squishy white stuff.  Go easy on the dairy products as well- especially cheese.  If you make the diet changes, your hemorrhoid can heal on it's own without the need for a doctor.  It will take a few months, and you will have to stick with the good diet from now on.  If you don't, the hemorrhoid will return, with friends and vengence, and progress to the point where surgury is needed to remove it.  You will not like the surgery, trust me.  It is a lot more expensive and painful than you want to consider.  Follow the directions for damage control for now, and get more comfy.  Follow the diet changes to heal and prevent a repeat in the future.|`|tnQGOsaeaa	Go to a drug store and get a over the counter medicine called Preparation H <br>  <br>  ~bobo|`|79GfYzv3aa	You had better go to see a doctor and check your problem although you don't want to take the medicine or do the surgery.<br>  <br>  There is a kind of effective medicine that will good for you to cure the hemroid, no pain and no side effect.If you will trust what i said.Please click here: <a href="http://www.tcmadvisory.com/Hemorrhoid.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.tcmadvisory.com/Hemorrhoid.as...</a>
4KqXvusDaa	Oh gosh. I started my period one day before I went on this big camping trip with my friends and their parents. I talked to one of my closest friends and she walked with me everyday to the bathroom (like 30 minute walk ) so I could clean myself up. Bring wet wipes, plastic bags, and double up your pads if you use them. Tricky stuff. Also bring a towel to sleep on so that it doesn't get your sleeping bag dirty. Talk to your dad and tell him. He'll understand.|`|jiwTWNNtaa	Bring your pads and/or tampons and a package of baby wipes. Bring a stash of plastic grocery bags so you can wrap up your things after they're used. Dispose of the bags whenever you have an opportunity. Bring extra underwear too.<br>  <br>  It's up to you whether you tell your Dad that you have your period. It shouldn't matter, but it might prevent him from "investigating" the little bags you're hiding.<br>  <br>  Have fun camping and don't let your period get in the way of fun.|`|aJp3BbWcaa	Bring pads and make sure that there will be a comfort room there.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	You pack plenty of pads or tampons, and change them often.<br>  <br>  Experienced camper Alyssa Fielder offers these tips to remember when camping during your time of the month. <br>  <br>  Store your feminine protection products in a waterproof plastic bag. <br>  Bring extra zip-lock bags to store your used products. <br>  Pack extra underwear if you have room. <br>  Bring a supply of wet naps for cleansing purposes. <br>  Bring a bottle of freshwater for rinsing purposes.|`|AoUUfzXgaa	Not a very qood idea...maybe take a rain check if you can?!|`|dALX1qQdaa	bring pads and tampons|`|hYP6akCYaa	tampons of pad's just make sure that there is a proper palce for u to go to the bathroom|`|87nG6aKaaa	well thats really tough because you are going to be going to the bathroom a lot to change your pad or tampon. but it would be even harder if they didnt have a bathroom well just tell your dad that you are on your period and ask him if you can do it when you are not on your period or ask him if he doesn't mind having you go to the bathroom every 2 hours to change your pad or tampon.|`|AA10381258	I would definitely vote for tampons, since you might not have chances at regular bathrooms and cleansing. Also, feminine hygiene wipes or cottonelle fresh wipes, something like that. Don't forget the pamprin if you get bad cramps or bloating! Have fun!|`|tv7a1ixiaa	If you are used to your period now, try tampons.<br>  If you aren't, use pads.<br>  Use them discreetly and try not to think about it.<br>  Good luck|`|PXvAYYD5aa	uhm..<br>  thats tricky.<br>  tampons?<br>  bring a baggie yu can store them in?<br>  jeez idk actually|`|wHdPzovBaa	if you just started your period than you should only use pads but... if your going swimming than your going to need tampons!!!!|`|w7XNcmihaa	Bring tampons or pads.

3hmQYGnGaa	You should be fine. I've been in the pool multiple times during my period and I've never seen one drop of blood.|`|BIyiOgPYaa	Just put in a new tampon right before you get in the pool. And use a super.

Just do something like running or swimming, and push yourself as hard as you can. This will help get rid of the fat on you.<br>  <br>  Along with this, you should go to the gym and work-out. Take the protein you were talking about after your workout. Make sure to eat healthy.<br>  <br>  With working out, create a split. You may not know what this is, but basicly your workout should look something like this:<br>  Monday: Biceps and Back<br>  Tuesday: Abs<br>  Wednesday: Chest and triceps<br>  Thursday: Break from everything (including cardio)<br>  Friday: Legs<br>  Saturday: Abs and shoulders<br>  Sunday: Break from weights, still cardio<br>  <br>  You should do cardio after you workout and after the cardio, take you whey protein. You should start to loose weight and feel stronger.
Xg7i420Uaa	it sounds more like something with her digestive system..like if you dont get enough fiber it causes constipation,hard stools and can cause stomach pains..which can be quite severe..maybe its the oposite of that..maybe too much fiber..id go see the doctor either way.|`|OBW7N4KKaa	she probly has an infection<br>  i had diarreah for a month once but i ate and drank alot less acids and it went away|`|zw6EJ2izaa	Is there little white worms in the poo?

The diarrhea alone could cause more problems in of itself. Trust me, you don't want to have to see a Gastroenterologist as well.|`|5CD9Pe7Qaa	go 2 doctor
k5X78IM3aa	Low fat diet to go with the exercise.  It was given to me by a doctor when I was having problems with my gall bladder. It is not really a diet but a healthy way of eating.  You don't have to give up all fats, just the ones that are bad for you.  There are good & bad fats in all food groups.  You don't have to get it from a doctor... you can do a Google search for it.  It will give you foods to eat & foods to avoid & you will loose the fat.  Be sure to get the one for GI problems & not one for Nutra-sweet, etc that you have to spend extra money on.  You don't have to buy any special foods...just what's in the grocery store.<br>  <br>  Exercise & this way of eating should produce good results.  It works.  Good luck.
XZqSO94saa	You were so blessed. You had a beautiful bodie before, why did you want to loose weight, plus you had an amazing butt!<br>  <br>  You can gain weight by slowly increasing you're caloric intake starting by an extra serving of pasta and then adding a nutritional shake formatted supplement etc....<br>  <br>  Fast-food's wouldn't hurt if you're looking to gain some of you're but back. As they say "a calorie is a calorie doesn't matter how you consume it. You can consume 1000 calories worth of carrot's and you're body will still store it the same way as 1000 calories worth of cake."<br>  <br>  Hope i'v helped!|`|r1fLDlhCaa	you look better now....|`|06LADESUaa	Ummm.... possibly eat more???|`|fEHsLbwdaa	ew if u gain anything else u'll be fat; don't

BIyiOgPYaa	Wait another week then take another test.
79YQAbSRaa	Might want to check if open MRI is an option.  It really made a world of difference for me.|`|NEazdZWwaa	The diagnosis is going to be very tough to say.  As for the MRI, tell your doctor and see if he can give you something to relax you prior to the MRI.  If you are unable to tolerate the MRI even with valium, they can give you something stronger or put you to sleep.
79YQAbSRaa	I was diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) almost 6 years ago.  Been in remission since my first induction chemotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy.   So I guess that makes me a leukemia survivor. I know quite a lot about the disease.|`|DT80y28Maa	I know alot about Leukemia|`|lsO9Dr09aa	Leukemia is cancer in the blood or bone. It's when the production of white blood sells is too high. There are many types of leukimia and laukimia is a type of hematological neoplasm. <br>  <br>  Some symptoms are that you may become bruised easily or bleed a lot. It's harder for the blood to clot to stop the bleeding. The immune system might not be able to fight off a small infection or it could start attacking other parts of the body. Anemia could also result from leukemia. There are many other symptoms. <br>  <br>  athere's no known cause of leukemia as with most cancers. Some of the treatments are radiation therapy and bone marrow transplants.|`|406c4d57d4703cc8eb95656d67220b5daa	In 1990 i was diagnosed with biphenotypic leukemia, meaning I had acute myelogenous and acute lymphocytic leukemias combined. Remission was achieved with induction and 6 months later I received a matched unrelated bone marrow transplant.Yes I know a bit about leukemia as well....what is it you would like to know?|`|f7a52089d54ea643febc2fcffc9dd887aa	What would you like to know? I know a decent bit about it.
OXB8EpDQaa	Definetely. That is a great meal for a clean bulk. This is also a great pre-workout meal, (about an hour before.) But you can eat it anytime except the rice is not the best choice for a post-workout meal because you want simple carbs, not complex. These can be found in fruit and other stuff.
soCH3ycWaa	You can break your hymen with pretty much anything. You don't even have to penetrate your vagina, even heavy stretching or horseback riding can break your hymen. And once it's broken, it can't break again. <br>  <br>  However, keep in mind that some girls are born without a hymen. You might never experience bleeding or the pain associated with the breaking of your hymen.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Yes a hairbrush can break it and no a penis can't break something that's not there.|`|0ujpiBTCaa	A lot of things could break a hymen!Including a hairbrush if you put it into the vagina.<br>  I don't know how it feels, mine never ripped. If you are curious if your"s ripped, check with a hand mirror.<br>  <br>  It could rip MORE if you have sex, but probably won't.
QJ6qZ7ABaa	Yes, you're not being stereotypical. You may notice that many of the greatest figure skaters and gymnasts are Asian. <br>  <br>  Well, I guess it's not a very educated guess, but in general, Asians  have a petite figure. It's kind of like how people in different countries differ in physical appearance. For example, Asians have a less curvy figure than Brazilians, which isn't something that is affected by diet or exercise. Sometimes, how your body is sculpted is loosely based on your nationality.|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	They're malnourished.|`|ZXhgndqEaa	Well, it kind of is a stereotype. If Asians stick to their roots then they're generally eating less fatty foods. While others may just have the genetics for it.|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	I would attribute it to their diet. Genes & heredity too. Most of there dishes consist of rice, noodles vegetables and fish. Also, in most Asian cultures there are a lot of people, so people walk a lot, ride bicycles and so on. Driving is damn near impossible. Good diet (even though some may eat fast food occasionally) and being active is what is recommended to keep ANYONE from being overweight.

You have lots of nerves and blood vessels running up and down the backs of your thighs.  When you elevate your feet, you lift your thighs from the chair and reduce the pressure on the venous and nervous structures inside your legs.  I strongly suspect that the pain in your right leg is caused by constant pressure on your sciatic nerve.  This is a large nerve that runs the length of your right leg and over your right butt cheek to your spine.

MqCuDV4Naa	Did you really think anyone would actually read all of this?
68fPlKttaa	Yes and it is usually a doctor of the opposite sex to make it less awkward even though when its a male looking at female its kinda awkyward. but it used to be random but now due to dumb ppl say stuff like oh they gonna have gay sex or something they have opposite sex doctors do it now. yes thats the only way they can check if you have an infection down there. it will feel sort of awkward and uncomfortable and you have to be awake while doing this because sleep medication or paralyzing stuff will ruin the chemicals they use to check. <br>  <br>  heres the whole procedure: the doctor will use this weird metal funnel thing and put it inside your vagina with the smaller side of the funnel but all the way in and stretch out the walls of your vagina. basically its like shoving a megaphone or something all the way in. and on the outside there is two handles that looks like scissor handles and he will open it as wide as possible and it will have a small clamp thing that is in the other end of the funnel and it will lock itself at that width he adjusted it to. then he will pour this weird really really cold liquid inside the metal funnel device and it will pour inside your vagina and make you feel all weird because a cold liquid is inside your vagina and flowing all the way around into the very deep areas. then he will take take out the metal thing and use both his hands and spread open your vagina and he will wear this weird headband thing with a light at the top to look inside your vagina. the liquid he poured before is a blue colored liquid that will make the inside of your vagina neon blue and its glowing and there will be white spots which indicate an infection. and he has to be so close to your vagina in order to see your vagina can basically feel him breathing onto it. then he will say your good or theres a problem. then he will use this weird water squirting device similar to the ones at the dentists when they clean your teeth and he will have to shoot the water inside your vagina and the water is very very cold and he will use his other hand to stick inside your vagina and he will scrub out all the blue liquid and it will feel very uncomfortable and the water is set on like jet if you consider it like a garden hose. this whole entire procedure takes about 2-3 hrs. usually if you are doing this checkup you have to come back about every 3 months to do a checkup to make sure things stay ok or if it wasn't ok they will have to fix the problem by giving you this weird cream medication that you will have to use this long q-tip to scrub on your vaginal walls|`|HzUM8hVSaa	most likely they would have to look. it is where the problem is.
rADtJIIzaa	Keep going on the math and science.  You'll need to take a lot of those in college to get into dental school, and so the more you know, the better your chances of getting good grades in those classes in college, which you will need to get into dental school.

If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts. All of this combined with a proper diet full of lean protein and carbs, and you should be in business. If you need anymore help email me.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.|`|ysHxTJ2taa	The most effective way to burn fat is to eat less food and exercise more, the problems surface when we actually try to put that into operation! There are lots of opportunities to fail in the real world don't you think?! The sole diet which clearly worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I lost 25 pounds, it clearly does work!|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	Well unfortunately im not advertising with this answer. 80-90 percent of losing weight is diet, just eat less and healthier, if you dont know what that means ask your parents or friends or search google, the rest of the percent is exercise so doing that will also help. Its hard because you have to stay persistent and dont just diet for a short time because after you will quickly gain it back, learn to eat healthier for your life.
5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	Direct access: Why do so many states still limit direct access...espeically in musculoskeletal care where a good screening can rule out underlying medical problems. Combine this with the fact that 85% of medical school graduates cannot demonstrate competency on a basic musculoskeletal exam and that only 1/3 of US medical schools require physicians to take a course in musculoskeletal medicine and we're asking physicians to call shots on the best way to approach musculoskeletal care. In reality, they wouldn't know the least bit of current physical therapy research if it hit them in the face. <br>  <br>  Physical therapy should be the "best first choice" in musculoskeletal medicine: "you have surgery, you have drugs, or you have us."

High quantities of sodium can show up in some unlikely sources, such as canned vegetable soup and cottage cheese, so check labels (and pass on the salt shaker). Test your portion control smarts.<br>  <br>  EXCESS (AND REFINED) CARBS I'm talking about the white stuff--cookies, white bread, chips. Not only do they offer little nutritionally, but they also can cause water retention because when you overdo it, your body stockpiles carbohydrates as a quickly accessible source of fuel. Great for a marathon runner; unnecessary for the rest of us. Click here for loads of healthy carb ideas.<br>  <br>  BULKY RAW FOODS Eating large amount of raw veggies simply takes up more space in your GI tract, which can make you feel bloated. Don't skip veggies; try a small amount lightly steamed or snack on unsweetened dried fruits.<br>  <br>  "GASSY" FOODS Veggies like onions, broccoli, and brussels sprouts are all ultra healthy, but they also create excess gas in your intestinal tract. If you want a flat belly for a big event, just skip 'em the day of. Jumpstart the Flat Belly Diet today and shrink your belly in 4 days.<br>  <br>  GUM Chewing gum can make you swallow air, which then gets trapped in your belly, causing pressure, bloating, and gas.

If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts.

Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.

KOYC3XkJaa	How long ago did you get burned? If it just happened, soak your legs in cool water for at least 15 minutes, and then until it stops hurting in a "burning" kind of way. Then pat your legs dry and lightly bandage with nonstick gauze. And take some painkillers/anti-inflammatories.<br>  If you've had the burn a day or longer, you should head to the doctor's, as it's too late for that first aid.|`|HKHCuRI8aa	i use allow -vera gel on every burn possible, it takes out all heat fast there is nothing better.|`|LaCj6C8Raa	Perhaps you should offer some more information concerning what kind of burn (fire/heat, electric, grease, sun) and when this happened.<br>  <br>  If it's a sun-burn, just soak them in cold water.  Fire or heat burns, the poster who said that the cold water will work for immediate first aid, but if it's been longer than that, you need to call your doctor, and they may even suggest ER. Electric burns or severe heat burns (talking severe 2nd degree and 3rd degree), you need to proceed directly to the the ER, do not pass go, do not collect $200.|`|ZQMjPCDxaa	Burns that cause swelling can be extremely dangerous.

UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise. If this seems confusing, you can get a free personalized workout routine at <a href="http://shtrainer.com" rel="nofollow">http://shtrainer.com</a>

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, it's estimated that one in three Americans is overweight, an increase of at least 30% in the last ten yrs.  financially, people can afford to eat expensive but greasy foods.  Fat in our diet is making us fat because one can get an awful lot of calories out of a small amount of food.  also some probable causes of being fat/overweight are:<br>  Faulty eating habits such as bedtime snacking<br>  Overeating<br>  Inactivity (decreased energy expenditure)<br>  Endocrinal disorder<br>  Drug action effect|`|TNLpkLmuaa	one reason could be because of larger portion sizes we have grown accustomed to at fast food restaurants and the lack of physical activity only makes it worse|`|aUjoyzcxaa	Because of Bush.|`|GWoW1o5oaa	I'm not.|`|8SRjELNBaa	because we're billions of dollars in debt, just think how many gym's we could build with all that money.. mhmm.

Limit "worrying time" to around 45 mns, daily, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to worry again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St.John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|1LlhqADoaa	usually,when i sleep badly, i will do much exercise.

ZNbauLJzaa	There is nothing you can feed a cat or kitten that will make it hypoallergenic.  There is something in the saliva that makes people allergic.  Cats have specific nutritional needs and must be fed cat food and those are all pretty much the same.   You can try getting a kitten and giving it a bath once a week to keep the dander down, or just keep taking Benedryl.

ekEj2Mbiaa	I've read all your questions, and I'm here to help.    I know how you feel. I've been there before. In 6th grade, I had no friends, I was "the weird girl" and "that emo girl". Music helped me a lot. Then I told my mom (I was very scared at the time and didn't know how to tell her) I was depressed.    She kind of already had an idea that I was since I didn't want to go to school. I thought not going to school would help. I felt if I isolated myself from everyone that I wouldn't be depressed anymore since I wouldn't have to deal with them. Ha, I was so wrong. It only makes it worse. That's just running away from the problem, doesn't solve it.    So one day I just stayed home from school and said "I'm upset."  She asked me what was wrong, and I told her "The kids in my school hate me and I have no one to talk to."  I went into therapy, switched classes - made some friends, felt a little bit better about myself.    Go back to school - This'll give you some courage.  Once you have the courage to go back to school, you can have the courage to talk to your mom.    Right now, as soon as you read this, I want you to tell your mom these really simple words: "I'm upset." or "I'm depressed." It's just 2 words. Your mom will know how to react to it, and won't judge you. I'm sure she'll understand.     Why are you scared to tell her? Are you scared of her reaction?  I'm sure she'll just ask you what's wrong. Just simply let her know why.  She can then help you.    You're suffering right now, the only way to get some relief is to get the courage. Listen to "Famous Last Words" by My Chemical Romance.  Hopefully that'll give you some kind of courage to speak up.    Good luck!  Please email me if you ever need to talk.!!!!!!!|`|3XWxs1ruaa	well ive been depressed since 6-7th grade and now im in 9th and have just been diagnosed with depression. its good that you want to tell your mom now because trust me depression can get way worse, when it got worse for me i thought about suicide day and night and even planned it but now im on prozac for 4 days and i talk to someone.   about your mom you have a couple of ways if u want  -talk to her face to face  -print this out and show her  -write her a letter/text her  -tell someone in school like a teacher or couselor this and if they can talk to your mom for u  all of these might work but i dont know how your mom is, but you need to know ur mom cares about u and loves u (u probably know that lol) so no matter what happens she will be there for u and will always support u. its something that will happen and you will ot regret it(hopefully) u need to talk to her if u really think u have depression, cuz depression never gets easier it only gets worse.i know from experience. it can lead to way worse actions and stuff. i hope this helped and good luck, feel free to email me at any time if u want.|`|y43tzOQlaa	I really hate the phrase, "get over it" , there is a point when you have to make the choice to move through and past your situation or stay in it and give up your choices. I do believe we are creators of our own existence, so that's where you start. Talk to your mom, ask her to be patient and please listen to you. Then move forward with some counseling, nothing too scary just someone to talk to. There you are, at the start, one step at a time. Take care and learn how to ask for help!|`|jTM6Upm5aa	I was very similar to you when I was your age, ( I was very lonely), I had a hard time keeping friends as well. I now know that I suffered from depression and it made it hard for anyone to be around me because I was always so negative, irritable, angry, withdrawn, shy, ( I had all the symptoms of depression ). I was antisocial, because I could never get the results I wanted, because I couldn`t, I was too depressed, people saw that. My friends would ask me all the time, " why aren`t you smiling, you never smile", and they`d walk away. That would depress me even more.    If I were you, I would talk to a teacher or a guidance counsellor, and ask for help regarding mental health.Have courage, GOOD LUCK!!|`|ByUS0k8waa	You could write your mother a letter and leave it in her handbag or somewhere she will only find it.

When you tell them they can get you the help you need and start feeling better. I was scared to tell my parents when i thought something was wrong with me too. But when i told them i got diagnosed with bipolar and got the help i needed and now i am doing much better! So don't be afraid they want to help you!  Good Luck!|`|CYzTJIhVaa	You have got to talk to your mom.  Maybe you can first speak with someone who you feel more comfortable with and then you can talk to her with them.  It might be a little easier.  But you are way too young to start developing depression and the sooner you nip it in the bud, the better the rest of your life will be. I am not sure but I don't think you can receive therapy without your mom's consent anyway so you should get started on that ASAP.  i hope this is helpful!!!
Tobo0jgjaa	I'm not sure if that was a panic attack.  Were you really scared, anxious, or more sad, depressed?<br>  <br>   A panic attack is a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which four (or more) of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes:<br>  <br>      * Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate<br>      * Sweating<br>      * Trembling or shaking<br>      * Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering<br>      * Feeling of choking<br>      * Chest pain or discomfort<br>      * Nausea or abdominal distress<br>      * Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint<br>      * Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)<br>      * Fear of losing control or going crazy<br>      * Fear of dying<br>      * Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)<br>      * Chills or hot flushes <br>  <br>  This is a good website about them:<br>  <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/panic_attacks/article_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/panic_att...</a><br>  <br>  If you did have a panic attack, it's not a guarantee you'll keep having them.  5% of the population have them at one time or another.  I wouldn't worry about it, just having one, even a few,  does not mean you have any kind of anxiety or panic disorder.
o2FJIXS9aa	Not very long at all. I used to suffer from a combination of anorexia and bulimia. It is not a good method of losing weight, starvation. You aren't learning new habits and retraining yourself, all you are doing is slowing down your metabolism severely. When you starve and attempt to resume normal eating habits, you will find it harder to keep your weight down.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	It greatly depends on your body. After approximately 7-10 days, (in some people as early as 3-4 days) your body will start metabolizing the fat in your body to be used as energy.    In a fasting sense, it can be perfectly healthy in moderation. Fasts from 3-20 days (juice fasts or water fasts) can be very detoxifying, and can aid in weight loss.     You should NOT however, rely on fasting alone to lose weight. You truly do need to adopt a more healthy eating plan before and after a fast... focusing on whole raw vegetables and fruits, and limiting greatly the intake of processed foods, animal products, etc.     If you undertake a successful fast and lose 20 pounds, if you return to your normal eating habits afterwards, you will of course gain the weight back, plus more. Use a fast as a means to jump-start a healthy eating plan.|`|pMzq6B3paa	That's very dangerous! First of all you don't loose fat, you loose muscle, and all the nutrients in your body. You will start to loose muscle, hair, your nails become yellow, your skin will get pail and patchy. And as soon as you start eating you will gain weight, plus you will have serious health problems.|`|4oDn5zIpaa	actually first your body will not burn any fat at all because it is in starvation mode for a week then it will start to loose weight and you will become ill and stuff. This is very unhealthy and you best bet on loosing weight is to go to the doctor and and them to run a couple test and make you and exercise and meal plan usually the food is regular and tast great and you wont be exercising like crazy. AND NOT EATING IS HORIBLE ON THE BODY AND YOU COULD DIE AFTER 2 WEEKS EVEN|`|6Au6jZfUaa	Please don't starve yourself, you will get sick. You have only one body, you need to look after it. Follow a sensible diet instead, add more veggies to your diet, beans, whole grains, try soups and salads with a piece of grilled chicken or turkey. Don't eat anything white (potatoes, rice, pasta), avoid sugar- try xylitol or stevia as sugar substitutes. Eat smaller portions- a touch bigger than the size of the palm of your hand, drink water and walk for 1 hour a day. After just one month of this plan, you should see results, but stick with it to reap more benefits. Lifting weight 2-3 times per week also revs up your metabolism.|`|BgBoTURkaa	i am sorry but i would have to disagree with that other answer. anorexia is something that a person needs help beating. there are plenty of ways to lose weight by having a healthy diet    it will take longer but you tend to avoid things like death or walking round like a living corps. i saw your question and it made me open a acount. not eating is not the way to go healthy diet and being active.|`|f02200ae196155b83f406d2d9431911daa	Not eating is not a good way to lose weight. You will be doing more harm to your body and there is always a chance you will so much damage that it will lead you to new health problems even death.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	A week, but as soon as you start eating you'll gain it back. Lose weight the right way through diet and exercise|`|YA0wKGORaa	Im anorexic and it took me a good week or two before I started seeing results.

It could be the scale too.  Some scales will just fluctuate by a few pounds each time you use it. I've used scales that say one thing, and then if you step on it again in 2 seconds it will change, sometimes as much as 6 pounds.   I only weigh myself once a week for that reason.

By touching your chest you often use it for breaks and to help push back up and therefore you do not get the full effect of the bench press.

AA11611389	I did that playing goalie  - the ball hit my hand wrong and my middle finger swelled up so much I couldn't bend it.  Icing it for 15 minutes helps to reduce the inflammation.  Ibuprofen helps to ease the pain a little too.  But it just takes some time.

Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.

I knew both are good for your skin: tea tree oil kills infections, aloe vera restores damage skin. maybe you can try pure tea tree oil on the affected area. I wouldn't use bleach, sounds harsh!

It will probably come tomorrow at work!|`|lzcglDnMaa	I lost my virginity inside a guys truck. I was on my period and we got blood everywhere. The loser broke up with me not long after. It is funny now that I look back on it. I am on my period too, started yesterday. I feel for you.|`|faHs7u1Baa	I was having one of those days, speeding home after work...red lights and sirens...oh $ @%! Cop pulls me over...blah blah...I'm digging in my purse for my license and about 5 tampons are rolling around in my purse while he's watching. I started crying a little, being nervous. He let me go with a warning - what a night! lol|`|w6meiHggaa	i can tell you i got mine at camp, with no friends.  i know that's not funny, but its probably worse than what ur going through|`|6qsocyK3aa	I got mine in the middle of an A Level exam. I was in the middle of writing and suddenly I just felt this trickle. My pad wasn't in properly, so it leaked all over my pants and the seat. I was at the back of the room so no one noticed thank god (how embarassing would that have been?). I kind of waited until everyone had gone and then slunk out the room with my jumper/sweater round my waist so no one could see the stain. :S|`|XdHEt6anaa	I first got my period when I was in my Maths class. I had a pink coat that time and I was sitting on it; when it was time to pack up, I started putting on my coat until I noticed red stains all over it. I had no idea what it was but I guessed it was my period. Everyone was like 'Er, what the hell is that?' and they started laughing at me! but it wasn't that bad since I go to a girls school! =]|`|maDs9u4paa	I was on my period and had the worst cramps, I was complaining alot and my boyfriend didn't help by making fun of me.    I told him " You don't understand you don't know what it's like to have cramps"  and he did a childish taunt " hah hah and I'll never have to know sucked in"  So I said, " well this might come close" Got up and socked him right below the belly to wind him. He fell to the floor in agony and that cheer me up :)  Thanks to woman's self defense and kick boxing classes haha.|`|bgdjtJepaa	One time my then boyfriend came in to town for my Aunt's rehearsal dinner, and I had just started my period.  My first day is pretty intense, so I stuffed my tiny little purse FULL of tampons.  My ex asks me if I can put something in my purse for him, and having forgotten what I'd done I snapped the tiny thing open and the tampons pop out in this huge cloud everywhere.  I had to try and pick them up really fast and cram them back in there.  He held whatever it was for the rest of the night.|`|u6papgwFaa	Well... I had PE and I was on my period. Just my luck we were doing gymnastics and we were stretching out at the beginning of the lesson. My teacher wondered why I wasn't participating fully.

It was so embarrassing 'cos many of them hadn't started!|`|UgoSGjNiaa	ugh 8th grade i wet to a school that required us to wear uniforms. at the time my periods weren't regular and were really heavy. i was wearing khaki pants and started my period. need i say more    also i have tampons loose in my purse. i was talking to a guy i had a huge crush on and was looking for a pen blindly. i reached in and pulled out the tampon thinking it was a pen. haha oh goodness thank you mother nature|`|nidCgr73aa	Well it wasn't funny for me at the time but...    When I was twelve (I'm fourteen now), on holiday, abroad (Turkey), in a water park, while wearing a bikini - quite a light one at that - I started my first ever period.    I had to go round the rest of the day with a beach towel round my waist, not allowed to go in the water until I got back to the hotel and cleaned up (which was about half an hour away) and I was far, far, far to hot and self concieuous.    I also looked like a right idiot while everyone was around sun bathing in hardly there bikinis and going down water slides when I was there, boiling hot, sitting with a towel round me.    Also before I get my period and nearly everyday I'm on them (which is eight days solid) I get nose bleeds!    My body just loves me.    Hope I helped!

Don't be afraid of it.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	It appears u have psychic gifts and powers and u r not very fully aware of all your powers, and their applications.<br>  There is no need to be scared, there is nothing wrong with u, only u r more sensitive and more blessed with powers<br>  Maybe u should contact some experienced psychic to help u to channelise your powers and use it for helping other humans in need.|`|Dt1YM4PIaa	seems to me... that you may have a 6th sense. you might be phyicic. your very lucky. i have always wanted to be phyicic.|`|FGuzsRpJaa	I agree with Jesse H.<br>  Unless your related to Haley Joel Osment :)<br>  just joshing ya|`|HN693GiNaa	you have a gift.  Lucky you!|`|vRFiRqnpaa	As odd as whats happening in your life, if you look at it in a literal sense its really not odd at all. You seem to be one of the many people who are at the right place at the right time. Dreams are another issue, and dreams are usually cause by memory fragments all jumbled together. There could of been certain things you've seen on TV or even in the movies that just happened to be in your dream. You might not even realize it though. I hope this helps.|`|AA12071552	you have a sixth sense that is stronger in you than others, go talk to a psychic or palm reader for more knowledge|`|LCObcecHaa	I don't think anything is wrong with you mentally. It sounds like you just have a very special ability love :)<br>  You should research it more! It sounds like you're having premonitions, which is when you can predict a future event (like the weather.)<br>  I would call your ability paranormal or supernatural. <br>  Maybe you accidentally trained your brain to do it, it's possible! I even find myself doing it sometimes, but not to your extent.<br>  Don't be scared love, just keep researching it, and drag out this ability to the best of your ability UNLESS IT BECOMES DANGEROUS. I'm not trying to harm you AT ALL. I just think things like this are really interesting :)|`|idQwSOKNaa	Dear heart,<br>  No, nothing is wrong with you.  You are just a bit frightened, and yes, I have had dreams over the years which "warned" me of stuff that would happen, or that "could happen" if I was not careful.  Call them omens, or, premonitions, or just "signals" from the Heavenly Father to let us know and be aware of things around us.   Some of us not so, some of us more so.<br>  The guy that followed you - hey ! maybe take a different route home?  avoid him.   The girl that cried giving you her dog is like someone you care about, and the dog meant a lot to her...so pay attention, and "understand" when she starts telling you about her little dog...she needs love too.  Most people, when things happen, don't try to understand or listen to the person who is hurting...and we need to be aware.  I am now 75+ years, and have seen lots of stuff that "happened" in my dreams before it happened.  But that does NOT mean that I run my life by these dreams.   It simply is like an emotional "relief" to know that I can handle it with God's help, and that God is showing me that hey ! no matter what happens, He cares about me enough to warn me.    Sometimes a dream I dream is something that someone else is or will be dreaming.   Flashbacks from a bad experience, for example.   Other times, it has been that God wanted me to know about, even things in the Holocaust that was happening, but no one ever told me about, but later, after the WW II was over, I would hear about it, or read about it having happened.    So I am extra sensitive, I guess to my dreams.<br>  It is a "gift" - so treat it as such, and let this gift help you to be a better person, like Joseph in the Bible who dreamed.    Then there were dreams the Pharoah had that Joseph interpreted for him.    Daniel had dreams and visions.   Ezekiel.     Isaiah.     When Jacob was sleeping under the starry sky, he had a dream of God and a stairway to Heaven with angels going up and down on it.    God spoke to him through it.   Then there was Joseph who dreamed and through the dream the Angel told him that he was to flee from Bethlehem to save Jesus' life.<br>  What we dream does not usually happen...often when we dream...it comes in spits and spurts so that we do not get a sequence or a result...we only know "it makes us uneasy" when we get scared.   So my suggestion is to always check situations out and be careful not to put yourself in jeopardy.<br>  Example:  When I was young, about 21, I went to a "meeting" with someone about 100 miles away.  As a young adult, I was taking a chance.<br>  I had a dream about a door, and I was realizing in the dream that someone was on the other side of the door, in a motel room, and so I stuck a chair under the door knob so that no one could come through the door.   Never gave it a thought, until I went on that trip, and discovered a door between my room and the one where the person who had brought me was staying. So I did as I did in the dream, I stuck a chair under the door, and that protected me.    My mother and I laughed over it later, for I was so naive that I trusted this person...I did not know him, really, and I never did take a chance like that again.  <br>  So learn from some of this.    Savor the life you have, and live it to the full, and remember Jesus said,  "I am come to give you life, that you might have it abundantly"   John 10.10  <br>  Hope I have helped you not be so scared.   Yours, Littlelady75
rVnTnuU1aa	Yes. I would not recommend to do that. Your body will also think its in starvation and will go into survival mode. You may not lose any weight by doing that.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Yes, you will. Your body will be unable to function because you aren't giving it any fuel - you'll be very tired, you won't be able to think straight, you'll faint/pass out, etc.    Furthermore, after 10 days, when you start eating again, you'll gain all the original weight back. Starving yourself is NOT a sensible or an efficient diet option.    If you're serious about losing weight, cut back on the fats and sugars in your diet - don't stop eating altogether.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I know I feel sick by just drinking a glass of water too fast. Lol! If you drink water fast like you would eat a bag of chips fast, you could feel sick, yeah....|`|5nfqY9T7aa	You mean, just drink water and not eat for 10 days? That's extremely stupid.  You'll just get sick.|`|eA5wTDFKaa	thatd be very very very dangerous  and i bet you you will eat something  and by the 10 days that have ended you know what?  youll start putting em all back on once u eat.|`|jQCmJQrtaa	ive just done this today ,so today is my 10th day ..i did a little cardio on the 3rd and 4th day and i didnt eat anything ...well all together i lost 12 lbs -     i am so happy with the results and i will slowly get back into eating more healthier options for my meals and avoid bad snacks etc..     and please dont listen to anyone who says its bad for you because i know it can be if you do 30+ days without suppervison but a small 10 days while resting and not doing really strenuous activities is fine and actually going to benifit you health wise and physically ..so i'd say go for it ..    P.s- i can tell you ,the first 2 days are the worst ,you feel hungry and tired and irritated but if you keep strong and make it to the 3rd day you'll be much better and ketosis will start kicking in and you will start losing weight ..    http://fasting.ygoy.com/benefits-of-wate...    GOOD LUCK !!! i hope you do it and it all goes well|`|qOUNCq8qaa	I think you'll get like really tired|`|gqvvXknQaa	Yes. Your body needs vitamins and protein. Your immune system will go out of wack and you could get really sick. If you are going to go on a liquid diet, try something like a protein shake or a slim-fast shake.|`|kTZevQNHaa	Your body needs fuel...water ain't gonna cut it kid..don't do it.  Deprivation is a bad and unhealthy  idea.  Your body's like a machine...if you don't feed it and give it the necessary fuel, it's not gonna function  properly...meanwhile, there's people all over this planet starving to death and dying for a bite to eat...be grateful for the food you have and eat--take care of your body...don't starve so you look good in a pair of jeans...it's not making sense.  Eat well and exercize regularly--that is common sense and the only way to lose weight and stay fit.    These quick fix trends are nonesense.|`|l7vDiKDzaa	YES!! You will be nauseous, weak and have diahrrea.  You need nutrients or you will be sick.|`|MpKjfGGaaa	Yes you will get very sick.  It is not natural and it just as bad as not drinking or eating at all. When people starve themselves like that their body enters a state where it holds on to any fat it already has and their metabolism slows down a lot so once you would start eating again you will gain a lot more than you have lost.  Just try eating atleast 900 calories a day and taking walks, I lost 40 pounds just doing that for 2 months.   Good Luck!|`|F8mqHdwlaa	yes.|`|fA42bQHraa	Your body will start eating your accumulated body fat, but it will also start burning your muscle for fuel.    You'll get really tired and have zero energy. You'll want to sleep all the time and be really grumpy.    You need vitamins too, but 10 days shouldn't result in anything that would put you in the hospital depending on your age and physical condition.    You're better off going on a full meal replacement diet with something like slimfast. Three cans will give you all your vitamins/minerals, and keep your calories to under 600 a day.    It's still a crash diet, but it won't be as harmful for you and you'll still be able to function.    The bottom line is that it's a really bad idea and you should find another way to lose weight if that is what you're trying to do.|`|B1WOmORUaa	The best remedy to slim down is to eat little at morning and do little physical exercise so that ur body muscles burn.|`|e68fade77a7918331a78f97ad0b31b7faa	yes you dumb ****|`|VAsHKgYsaa	The thing is when you start that crap it really messes with your metabolic rate, making it hard to keep it off. You may lose 10lbs then gain 20lbs when you're done. You're metabolic rate drops when you lose weight too, so you may gain more.    I know you have more self control when you don't eat at all, but you really should just eat healthy and exercise.
f02200ae196155b83f406d2d9431911daa	Leave your money at home and take healthy snacks to work with you.|`|Z9360MMxaa	Print off some pictures of really obese people and keep one tucked away in your pocket. Maybe make a note on it like "This is what indulging in snacks will do to you" Carry around some gum and chew on it whenever you have a craving or find a tasty healthy alternative like fruit or vegetables. It's okay to treat yourself once in awhile but eating unhealthy will catch up with you.|`|aIHSmRYwaa	Just bring veggies or fruit with you. And lots of water!|`|1UID5JtNaa	I would try to have a plentiful supply of alternatives readily available- but it has to be satisfying- I like to snack on nuts, those little whole grain gold fish, and of course the old stand-bys of fruit and veggies.    Maybe you can request a "healthy" vending machine- see if your company can do anything about replacing the high fat, high calorie, low fiber selections with alternatives.
F8EnH6JQaa	no|`|SFEpBuO4aa	Yeah|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	It is hard to tell with your posture like that because it looks like you are sticking out your stomach. But you do look toned out from the pic so you could wear one. Either you needed someones opinion or you knew this already.|`|qGiFTnC2aa	Sure, if you feel comfortable in one. You'll need the bottoms to complement your curvy tummy, I reckon fairly skimpy low cut ones would be best, if they come up high and flatten your stomach halfway across it looks...not good. I've tried!|`|eLxD5HbBaa	hey i think we need to see the entire body to really honestly say if your stomach  would look good in a bikini but if you feel good in one then go for it :D|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Of course! Are you kidding?!?!? Work on your confidence!|`|Ii2nqQUWaa	hell yeah babe|`|owo5pn5caa	nah
gAOAdOHraa	I haven't had one but I'm sure you will be fine.  Go and have something nice to eat when you finish and you'll feel much better.|`|AA10766729	I had to wear a Foley for a full week (after a bladder puncture), and it wasn't anything horrible.  Mostly uncomfortable, but not really painful. <br>  <br>  The type of catheter you're getting will be fairly quick, and they may use a topical numbing agent to insert with.  Just try to relax as much as possible, STAY STILL, and the procedure should be over in probably less than 10 minutes.
211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	Aw, sweetie - I hate to say this, but the good news is that it is really simple - "growing pains."  Yup - nothing to be concerned about here... just simple growing pains.  You increased a cup size and your body will take its own sweet azz time getting use to it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.  If it hurts really, really bad, take a couple of Tylenol.  Take good care!!
AA10614226	Maybe you stop going deep... jk jk.|`|0tXcfq0waa	Sore throats can be a pain sometimes.. well what i think you should do is drink a glass of orange juice (it's sometimes considered medicine), before you go to bed have some warm milk mixed with about a spoon of honey, and apply some Vix Vapo rub around your throat or chest then get under the covers to keep warm..!!! Hope you feel better soon!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Ask for more testing. It must be something unusual. Go to the ER and tell them what has been going on and what your dr said. Be persistant. I hope you feel better soon. Throat coat tea puts a coat in your throat, it might help.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	See another doctor and stop self-medicating . . . as you have learned, it does not work but may stifle or hide symptoms that the doctor needs to evidence for diagnosis.|`|DCe7GVJAaa	try another DR, or emergency room and tekk yhem the whole truth and nothing but the truth.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	tell you dr. office you want a strep throat test. they swab your throat and your done in about 10 min. We let our patients come in to get a lab only check with out seeing the doc.    Feel better|`|d8KnXFoLaa	I would go to a different doctor|`|4nCoFPlOaa	Drink a lot of fluids, pineapple juice can help cure sore throats. Take a painkiller and rest, you'll feel better in a couple of days. If you notice any white spots at the back of your throat it can be a sign of infection and will require antibiotics. Hope you feel better soon :)|`|tMuUh6YGaa	Buy some sore throat spray (that is what it's called), which will numb and treat it. You can also try gargling salt water which can also treat it. Hope you feel better!|`|XxFHAT2aaa	first of all throw all that crap away. heres a couple things that you can do at home. one is take a glass of really warm water and add about 2 tsp or so of salt. stir it and gargle with it about five times or so like mouthwash. theres a lot of bacteria back there and this should really help with the itching. another thing you can do is get some limes or lemons and cut it in half, tilt your head back and squeeze the juice directly into your throat. the acid of the lemons really helps  with irritation. now if your having chest pain when you cough try using a little Vick's vapor rub on you chest. and make sure that if your coughing up gunk that you spit it out cause that stuff just makes everything worse.   if its cold out make sure that you cover up well especially wear a scarf around your neck and face. also another important thing is that you keep away from really cold drinks. keep drinking the hot teas and coca's. anything cold will just make everything worse. hope you feel better soon.

KOYC3XkJaa	If the knife ruptured the intestines, they would need immediate surgery. The intestines are chock-full of all sorts of nasty things, such as bacteria and fecal matter, which cause all sorts of nasty infections and very often death. So, if the knife hit the intestines, but they got surgery extremely quickly, your scenario is possible; they wouldn't die (well, there would be a chance they wouldn't) because of the surgery, but they could end up with a horrible infection. Since they would be in the hospital, they would be treated for the infection (obviously) so they could probably hold out for a while before the infection killed them (or they rallied and recovered). I do think 4 weeks would be stretching it a bit though. I'd say 10 days to 2 weeks would be the absolute maximum there. <br>  Of course, there are other scenarios as to the infection; perhaps the knife did not pierce the intestines, but they got an infection due to surgical complications (they'd need surgery to repair their stomach). In that case, the longer hold-out before dying would be more likely.<br>  I'm also assuming you're speaking of a systemic infection, not just the wound itself becoming infected, because unless that went completely untreated it would almost certainly heal itself no problem, and since they'd be in the hospital, it would be treated.|`|icmvhWndaa	u need help|`|52otNiElaa	Sounds like someone is trying to get info on a past event they experienced.|`|2Ms54b2Laa	i accidentally a whole bottle of coca cola|`|ww3ukbdVaa	it is possible. what's a more possible story? bullet to the chest. die D=|`|n2uPGKUVaa	The knife went through the intestines and also poked the stomach. So, that would mean that stomach acid would leak into the small intestine, further damaging it after what the knife already did. The small intestine is the primary organ that absorbs nutrients from the food we eat. <br>  <br>  So, it could not properly absorb nutrients after the knife wound. For the first few weeks the body still lived because of previously stored fat/nutrients it had, and whatever little amount the small intestine could absorb, but finally the body's stored nutrients ran out, and the small intestine had still not fully healed and couldn't sustain the body. The end.|`|ixyNeBhWaa	Truth is, anything is possible.  Two men can be shot 20 times, while one can survive and the other doesn't.<br>  It all depends on the body as well.  How well the body can fight off infection.  If the knife wound didn't kill her then its because she couldn't fight the infection.  There is always a possibility of survival.|`|iEJTAVP3aa	what are they getting an infection from?<br>  you cant just get an infection from a knife going in and coming out.<br>  plus they could treat an infection at the hospital.<br>  maybe if they had neumonia and the kife was extremely dirty.<br>  <br>  im hoping your writing a story about this topic...<br>  otherwise..

UEOldaPZaa	The actual process of removing wisdom teeth does not hurt as you will be numb (anesthetized).  Following, removal there will be a recovery period where you may be sore and swollen.    This depends on how your teeth are positioned prior to extraction.  If the are all the way out, there will be minimal soreness/swelling.  If the teeth are buried in the gums/bone (impacted), it will be more involved to remove the teeth and you can expect a longer recovery period and some swelling.     It is always recommended that you take some time off work/school following in case it is needed for recovery.  I usually recommend 3-4 days for my patients.  You will also be given medication for the pain if needed.  You can find out more info at: http://www.bcdentalcare.ca|`|aMQD2UnWaa	You go to sleep, they remove the teeth, wake-up with gauze in your mouth (for pressure to stop any bleeding) and a prescription for pain medicine.

Good Luck.|`|G0qsVfoUaa	It's not that bad...they freeze you up, or knock you out depending on the situation (I was out for mine since they were impacted) They give you pain killers for later, it can feel sore, but not really painful, and in a couple days the soreness wears off too. My dentist had me put ice packs on my face too help keep swelling down.|`|uz3WIqV3aa	you will a minor headache and it will be a little uncomfortable, but the actual process of pulling it out won't hurt. ( because of the anesthetics)|`|YAiKlPkMaa	It doesn't hurt when they are pulled but they can be troublesome to recover from. I had one out that hurt so bad when the novocaine wore off that I was almost climbing the walls. I had another 2 out and no problems at all. Minimal pain, just soreness. Make sure not to get food in the hole or to exert yourself and break that clot then you'll have dry socket.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	It is not fun.  But it is not all that bad.  If you can, just have one side removed.  Then later have the other side out.
dCIi9qf5aa	Most commercial say yes they do work but I don't know any one that has tried them and says they work. Plus I would be afraid of what they would do to my body. They in one way or another suppress one function of the body or another, so that's dangerous. Listen, go on line or go to a "Sturdee" health food store and get "Sea Silver" its liquid,vitamins,colloidal silver(a natural antibiotic and increases brain power),and other good stuff for your body. But the break through part is that it delivers oxygen to the cells which keeps cells from becoming cancerous. I can tell you that even though it is not a weight loss product, you do lose weigh, so much so that you need to start exercising as soon as you start to take it, to bulk up your muscles so that you don't look flabby from the weight loss.|`|vsKv5LLgaa	yes , are you serious ?
IMPvzBk1aa	It depends on the cause.  It can be neurological or vascular, meaning it originates in the nervous system or in the blood vessels.  It can be minor, and just have to do with the way you ar dressing or sitting with compression of nerves or vessels, aor it can be more serious and involve a disease process.  You should see a doctor.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you might have a circulation problem and perhaps blood thinners might help.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it could even be diabetes and perhaps you might want to post your question in the Diabetes section under Diseases & Conditions under Health.<br>  <br>  If you have had this numbness problem for some time perhaps you need to consult a doctor before it is too late.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	This is a question best asked of a doctor, in particular a rheumatologist.

uBTJtvITaa	What you need to do is minimize salt and fat in your diet.  Also, eat when you are hungry, even if this means eating 5 times a day.  ONLY eat when you are hungry and stop when you are satisified.  Try to make small changes so the blow isn't too hard on your body and you are less likely to go back to old habits.  For example, I love burgers and didn't want to give them up so I switched to turkey burgers.  Simple change like that cuts out both salt and fat and I don't feel cheated.    For coffee and condiments, cut out where you can.  Condiments add calories so if you don't really need them get rid of them.    One tip I wish I knew a long time ago is to use herbs and spices in your food.  For minimal caloric intake and some health benefits it makes good for you food not as bland.  Once the weight is off, just keep with the "diet" of lower fat and low salt.  If you make it a lifestyle change you will keep the weight off.    Same goes for exercise.  Make it a lifestyle change.  The best exercise for fat burn and weight loss is cardio.  Do aerobics in the morning or take a 15 minute run at lunch.  Go for a walk with your man.  Rent an aerobics or yoga video from Netflix (I like Wai Lana yoga).  Keep up with your exercise and keep in mind you will screw up/look silly /or be unable to do some of the moves in the aerobics and yoga tapes, but it will get better if you stick with it.  Just getting your butt off the couch consistently will help raise your metabolism.    Summary: eat fruits, veggies, whole grains, cut out unnecessary fats and salts, eat when you are hungry and never at any other time, drink plenty of water, and move your body!|`|kFECmFGLaa	Eat healthy, fruits, veggies, chicken and drink a lot of water. no candy or soda. you could get a workout dvd you can do at home or walk/jog around the neighborhood every day. calisthenics (jumping jacks cherry picker etc) you could do squats with out weights or lunges.  just try to get out and do some active things. good luck : )|`|NKcKzPskaa	It is feasible to lose weight rapidly but you should be realistic and accept that if you lose weight quickly then you will without doubt put it all back on again just as quickly. The only method which really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was reported in Fox News and CNN. I shed thrity pounds, it really does produce results!|`|aIHSmRYwaa	Don't drink soda, anything with a lot of sugar. Eat a lot of veggies, fruit and water.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	The est way to lose weight in that amount of time is to improve your diet.  Weight loss is about 70% of what you eat.  If you can improve your diet, by sticking to lean meats, fruits and veggies, and getting 30 minutes or so of exercise per day you will be able to lose weight.  Once you get it off, you just have to stay active so you are burning the amount of calories you take in.|`|WxWLC9yDaa	Hun, I was there I was 5'5 and 380. I had to reprogram myself..  You have a good start. The only soda you should drink is diet and limit that. If you snack snack on only veggies like celery(takes more calories to digest then it has) Also try pork rinds. Sounds crazy but I eat 3 or 4 pork rinds with a 32 ounce glass of water this keeps me full for longer periods of time. Also drink water lots of water. Also make your breakfast a bit larger then lunch and lunch bigger then dinner. No fried foods sweets or fatty foods. Take to walking and minor sit ups and torso twisting exercises.    Make sure you take vitamin B12 this is also very good for you when maintaining your weight.    FYI I went from  380 pounds in April of 2007 to 160 pounds on April 2008 and maintain my weight between 160 and 165 by doing this.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is not unusual for girl's periods to be very irregular for the first couple of years.  They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.

DzHB8z6Yaa	Act fast. The constant adjustments involved when you have braces cause inevitable pain. However, if you treat the pain early, you are much more likely to make the experience more tolerable.     Step 2: Take pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relief drugs such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help treat the deep mouth pain associated with new braces and constant adjustment. This pain originates from the pressure of shifting teeth and extends into the gums and jaws.     Step 3: Use wax. Orthodontists generally offer an unlimited supply of wax to patients. The friction associated with wires and metal fittings in the mouth tend to cause sores and cut the insides of cheeks and lips. By placing a ball of wax over the metal of the braces, especially at night, patients can avoid further irritation.     Step 4: Invest in an oral anesthetic. Over-the-counter anesthetics like Anbesol and Orajel temporarily deaden the mouth. Dab a small amount of the anesthetic on a cotton swab and apply it to sores in the mouth. The gel will deaden the spot and completely take away the pain for a limited amount of time. This method is particularly effective when trying to fall asleep at night. The gel wears off by morning, but allows a pathway to sleep.     Step 5:Try toothpaste for sensitive teeth. If you have a naturally sensitive mouth, a toothpaste for sensitive teeth can lessen mouth sensitivity over time and treat pain on a long term basis. By lessening the sensitivity of the mouth the adjustment of braces hurts less.     Step 6: Give it time. A tolerance to the pain associated with braces takes time. The longer you have braces the less you will experience the sores, cuts and deep pain that are common in the early stages|`|T93PeFvFaa	I had my Braces put on last year, and they killed and ached like mad!  So your not the only one. Theres nothing you can take the pain away with really, so you just leave them alone and the pain should go in a few days or so.

Sorryyy babes  x|`|HpqGnCFAaa	I had braces for a while they hurt for a few days its normal i suggest taking Tylenol or IB profin.|`|uz3WIqV3aa	very normal|`|5072c885a0d43b66b964ac86a027351faa	Its perfectly normal for them to sting. just take some painkillers and rub some gel on them, just hang in there will only hurt for a week or so.
MhpccWpmaa	If the smell is fishy, it's probably bacterial vaginosis which is a really common infection that requires you to go to the doctor to be diagnosed and treated.  As for the burning while you urinate, it sounds like you have a urinary tract infection which also requires that you go to the doctor for diagnosis and treatment.  Try to stay away from the bubble baths, they're actually not good for the health of your vagina.  But go to the doctors asap and get this taken care of, infections can cause a lot of worse problems if left untreated|`|QmDqNiqPaa	ive kinda had the same thing but it only lasted about a week...i went to the doctor to check for a BLADDER INFECTION and mine wasnt that serious it was just "irritated"...so u should go to the doctor because yours sounds more intense and a bladder infection might not sound like it would relate to your problem but my signs were the same as yours and that was a great possiblity so i would go!|`|0Uos14sJaa	hey.. do you have any discharge?..Does it still smell even right after you bathed?  you should go see your doctor... ..you may have an infection...

UEOldaPZaa	A broken down baby tooth can be a source of infection and can cause swelling of the gums, face or even neck.  If left alone, it could cause serious health problems and pain.  I recommend removing the baby tooth.  It is actually a very simple procedure and is not painful.  It would involve numbing the area and wiggling the tooth out. It is ok to be scared but there is really nothing to be concerned about.  You can find out more info at: http://www.bcdentalcare.ca    Hope this helps.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	Just go!

People there have relatives with serious mental illness, or have mental illness themselves, and are likely to know about these hospitals in particular.   If you are on Medicare, a stand-alone psychiatric hospital will use up some of your 190 day lifetime limit on inpatient care. A mental health inpatient unit that is part of a community hospital will not count towards those 190 days.
kA0xb0MVaa	It is likely that the other children will get it and any other children that they have been in contact with since your daughter's fever began.  The incubation period is between 7-14 days.  It is highly contagious.    Do let your doctor know, by calling the office and telling them what you suspect this is, so they can put your daughter in a treatment room immediately upon your arrival rather than making her wait in the waiting room and exposing more children.  Some moms wouldn't mind,and thankful to get it over with, but others would rather not.    Oatmeal baths, calamine, tylenol, there really isn't much that can be done for children.  Adults on the other hand, can take a medicine to help with some of the symptoms.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Chicken pox appears as tiny blisters that usually itch even BEFORE they appear.  Usually just with a fever, not cold symptoms.  If you are taking her to the doctor and think she has chicken pox, you should tell them.  They may not want her in the waiting room with all of the rest of the children.    Incubation period is 10 days - so 10 days from the onset of symptoms if someone else is going to get them (if they are pox) you can count on it.  The others may or may not get it depending on the exposure.  It lasts about seven to ten days.    I had six weeks of chicken pox at my house:  5-year-old son, 32-year-old husband, then 6-month-old baby...guess who was the biggest whiner of the three????|`|T93PeFvFaa	The other 3 children could get it, but you don't know yet if it's catchable or not, so if I was you I'd keep the other children well away from your daughter maybe let them stay at another relatives or something.

AA12233287	I take mine at night, so I don't know if the drowsiness would affect you or not. The best thing to do is ask your doc. They can take a little while to kick in.|`|vcBVpVa1aa	the point of klonopin is for long term effects.  if you want instant results, you need something like valium.|`|o5ueyi5Yaa	If you are perscribed a med by your doctor there is a reason for it. You've either displayed a trait or shared how you feel. In either situation your not going to get any results if your not taking the med. First of all any med in the class that klonopin is in takes weeks before you actually can notice if it's helping or not. So understand right off that no one can tell you squat about this med except for you, and your not going to be able to notice any lasting benefits for at least four weeks to more then six weeks of taking this med. So before you dysect opinions your going to have to trust yourself as well as your med manager, and give this med the chance it deaserves, as well as the chance you are in titled to in benifiting from this type of med.    I will tell you that if this med isn't the right portion of your chemical imbalnce the side effects will be noticed fast. However if it is what your needing then you'll begin to feel much better by the second or third week and just continue to notice your ability to function better as well. In all cases the expereinces of someone else shouldn't be rented space in your brain. Meaning that each and every med will regardless of what anyone might say will effect the one consuming it completely different then someone else. Sure there may be simular feelings or identical side effects but only you can honestly know what you are feelings or not feeling.     So before you fall into some others path claiming your not a geiny pig opr lab rat let the med have an honest time to balance you out. Effect will either subside over time or they are just something that will have to be lived with in order to not live with the issues going on with out the perticular med. I'll close with being that you have taken certain steps to try and feel better I would also sugggest giving a med at least two to four months to sink into your system before saying it's not working or helping.    Accepting that your going to have to take meds for the rest of your life in order to function or feel better doesn't mean that your not right or broken. It means that your one of millions of people who decided the feelings they were suffering from weren't right and you seeked out help. Pat yourself on the back for caring enough about yourself to do that, and also know that what your going through and the meds being perscribed weren't invented just for you. Your not alone, and so much research has been put into meds, people, and feelings so that more people can learn to live a happier, and healthier life. Be fair to yourself, the med, and always be open and honest with your doc. I hope some of this will be useful, and helpful to and for you. J    P.S. I reread the answers being given, and sam has the right idea, and that is take the med before you go to or as your going to sleep so the immediate side effects will have taken place while you were asleep. Trying to not get nervouse just before an appointment could have you over medicating yourself. Sams answer for taking before bedtime will help your body distribute the medication throughout your system, and be the most benificail for you.|`|DCe7GVJAaa	one half hr to kick in and up to 8hrs.for the medication to work pproperly

The more I did it, the more it just became natural to me to do it and now I don't hunch over anymore.  It takes a while to get used to sitting up straight all of the time but it looks so much better and eventually you don't even realize your doing it (oh...added bonus....your boobs look bigger too!)<br>  <br>  This is my personal advice...as far as balancing books?

Flatten your back until it is strait... than you have good posture.<br>  <br>  Also if u put your shoulders down your neck looks longer and u look taller. :-)|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	Sit as if you have a board supporting your back.  It helps oxygen flow.  Yoga can help with improving your posture.|`|9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	i'm not so sure balancing books helps that much.<br>  <br>  you will find it alot less tempting to slump your shoulders if you have stronger back muscles.  go to your local fitness center and do some assisted pullups (or real pullups if your strong enough) twice or three times a week.  and look up the "back bridge" and the "gymnastic bridge" (they're the same thing), because whenever i feel my back is stiff, i just do that for a few seconds and it cracks my back into place.  it feels really good.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	7 to 8 hours is best...|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	It varies by individual and the amount of energy which you expend on your daily basis, so if you run marathons every day you will need more sleep to recover than if you sit around watching tv.|`|M1PYqC3qaa	No - you really need at least 8. 10 would be great!<br>  Recent studies show that people who regularly sleep for less than 8 hours per night gain over twice as much weight over one year than people who regularly get 8 hours or more every night.<br>   You will find that if you sleep more, you will be happier, more energetic and able to concentrate better. Its important!|`|NeiA0DlJaa	8 hours of sleep is recomended.it is ok if 6hours also|`|Ev2uhqyCaa	no the reccommended nubmer is 8 hours of sleep a day|`|8SRjELNBaa	Shoot for 8-9 a night if your not old.

Do not keep junk food like cookies, chips, sweets and other high sugar content food. Junk food raises blood sugar levels, which reduces fat burning and increases appetite.<br>  <br>  2. Good Carbs Only<br>  <br>  There are good carbohydrates and bad. White bread, pasta, doughnuts, cakes and biscuits should be avoided. They can cause bloating, poor digestion, and lead to accumulation of fat. Good carbohydrates such as fresh fruits and vegetables should be eaten instead. Vegetable soups are an excellent choice for lunch.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Those Late Night Snacks<br>  <br>  Why? If you go straight to bed right after the late night meal excess sugar will just turn into fat as you need to be active to burn it off.<br>  <br>  4. Drink Less Alcohol<br>  <br>  One gram of alcohol contains 7 calories, which is about 182 calories per pint. Alcohol does not contain any nutrients. All the calories consumed through alcohol will be stored as fat. Recently even Britney Spears gave up booze to lose weight!<br>  <br>  5. Get Exercising<br>  <br>  Workout with weights twice per week and do cardio three times a week.

NhF9sM5jaa	it is a little expensive but I suggest Avene Cold Care Lip Balm. It can been found in major department stores and drug stores. I have really bad eczema and Avene is a line of products that treats skin conditions. It has worked better for me than any prescriptions. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, use petroleum jelly.<br>  <br>  If the Avene is too expensive for you, try Nivea Lip Care - Med Protected. Not as good, but really decent.|`|yUpHZwTMaa	OH my gosh that happens to me all the time, once it went ina circle to the bottom of my nose to my chin... horrible..  i know.<br>  <br>  i use hydrochortizone... <br>  <br>  <br>  if that doesnt work for you i take a vitamin E and bite it so i can squeeze the stuff out of it and use that.. <br>  <br>  DO NOT LICK YOUR LIPS ANY MORE!!!!<br>  <br>  hope t helps|`|pmbxv9Mraa	Dont lick your lips, your saliva has salt in it which causes them to dry even more.
UvU8MRhUaa	Sher is right - orthodontists no longer 'tighten' braces as this method of orthodontics hasn't been used for years. People still use the term 'tighten' because often the teeth feel tighter afterwards and i guess their parents would have had the old tightening method.     In fact, what you had done is called an adjustment. During an adjustment, your orthodontist will make sure everything is going smoothly, replace any ligatures that need replacing (sometimes they leave them on a couple of months, but usually it's once a month they're changed) and replace the archwire if needed. They'll also asses whether you need anything like rubber bands etc.    So far, I've only had one adjustment where I felt any pain or tightness, and that was when they changed my wire up to the next strongest. In fact, the majority of adjustments will come with no pain at all, especially once you've had a couple. This doesn't mean your teeth aren't moving, just that they're now used to moving!|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	Your braces aren't actually getting tightened...they are being adjusted. It is not a for sure thing to hurt after an adjustment. The soreness for me started the next morning or that night. Sometimes 12 hours after adjusting they would hurt.|`|uz3WIqV3aa	it will feel very tight but it won't hurt as much as the first time aanymore.|`|WcIeLbQ1aa	I had braces before too. Sometimes they hurt, sometimes they dont.|`|XmLJ84YBaa	Your teeth are probably getting closer to being straight and the ortho isn't having to tighten your braces as much as before. I had braces for just over a year and the tightening hurt less and less each month I was there.|`|1Nd4XrjVaa	they dont hurt, when you get them tightened but they do the first time, you have got used to them now you see, i got my bottom set on today and its hurting like hell :(:(|`|525eb07b25abcf2dd87f01b89a5f1dfdaa	Mine did not always hurt when I had them tightened. Your teeth are probably accustomed to the pressure now and not as 'set' in your gums as they were when your treatment started.I'm sure your orthodontist has done everything necessary,

What are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?<br>  A. STDs are diseases that you get by having sex and are the most common infectious diseases in the United States. They are diseases that you get by having sexual contact (vaginal, oral, or anal) with someone who already has an STD. STDs are caused by many different types of bacteria and viruses. There are more than 25 STDs that affect both men and women.|`|VlRPqdZUaa	STD's (sexually transmitted diseases)<br>  Include:<br>  <br>  Bacterial:<br>  <br>  Vaginitis<br>  Chlamydia or NGU<br>  Gonorrhea<br>  Syphilis<br>  Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)<br>  <br>  Viral:<br>  <br>  Herpes<br>  Genital Warts<br>  Hepatitis B<br>  Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)<br>  HIV/Aids<br>  <br>  Parasitic:<br>  <br>  Trichomonas
AA11640493	I just started a diet.  I weighed 304 and now 279.  Started Jan 1. I was motivated because my cholesterol was high.  I work out 5 days a week and eat alot of chicken.  Sometimes when iI dont feel like working out, I think of how good I will feel afterwards and how cute I will look in certain outfits. Also, I have to have the right music when I am working out.  I get bored easily.  I have a diffrent playlist for each day.|`|qGiFTnC2aa	I was about 30 lbs overweight - so not the sort of weight loss you were talking about. But I was sick of feeling tired, unhealthy and heavy.  Clothes looked awful and it was hard to keep up with my kids.  I started with light walking and jogging and built up to doing 10km fun runs, and mini triathlons. It feels good to be fit and healthy, I'm not tired all the time and I'm enjoying life.<br>  <br>  What really gave me an incentive is that my husband went away with the military for 6 months. I set myself a date - to lose as much as possible by the time he got back and I reached my goal.|`|aUjoyzcxaa	Sex.<br>  <br>  It's really hard to have sex when you get overweight, you get tired really fast, which is quite pathetic.<br>  <br>  And also, if you're fat, it's hard to get ***, too.|`|4Qx8lGs0aa	I'll usually watch a video of someone with an impressive body, and that would be my motivation for a bit.

What I try to do to keep my weight down is to buy food that is healthy and actually eat it instead of eatting the junk that's around. Oh yeah, there's lots of junk food in my house, but it makes me feel good when I say, "Bread, I'm not going to eat you because you make me fat!" I try to have fun with the concept that the food is like an evil entity that's trying to take over my body and soul, and I will just not let that happen because I am stronger and better than the evil spirit that lives in the bread. lol. Try to have fun with dieting and it won't seem so bad. Also to really answer your question. What motivates me to lose weight is I want to be able to feel as light as I use to be when I danced in dancing school. I took ballet, tap, and jazz in my younger years and loved the feeling of floating in the air as I did jumps, and loved the feeling of being able to glide around, bend, and stretch my body in all different ways without getting out of breath or being in pain. That's what I miss and that's what motivates me when I think about stuffing my face. Hope this helped. Good Luck and be stronger than the food! Just please don't go anorexic! :)|`|fF98hm8xaa	What really motivated me to lose weight was a guy. Cliche', I know, but I honestly couldn't be happier. I was sixteen and weighed 210. Although, I'm a 'big boned' girl, & I know that I'll never be a 00, I still feel great about myself. I'm down to a weight I'm comfortable with, and got the guy I wanted. ;)|`|eLxD5HbBaa	First of all congrats thats amazing man! I guess what motivates me to keep health is just the general feeling of well being and the self confidence i have in myself wherever i am, in whatever i wear ^_^ I also think because i have a history of diabetes in my family its really important for me to keep fit and healthy and avoid it and other health problems...|`|AA10806571	I'm 67 and I want to live a healthy as possible and as long as possible life....I gained lots of weight due to steroids that I took for lupus.

That was my motivation...have lots 53 pounds but many more to go....it's a good start and it's tough when you're this old....but I'm doing it.|`|1EB7fbxpaa	When I met my boyfriend he was going to the gym so I started to go because I didn't want to seem like a lazy unhealthy person.

2RzEaod9aa	Same reason weed is illegal while stuff like alcohol and cigarettes are legal. The other answerer said that large doses of anabolics can cause a spike in cholesterol levels. Yeah, so can large doses (or even medium doses) of f*cking McDonald's. Steroids also busts up your liver...but so do prescription drugs and alcohol.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically, it's just stupid. The people in Washington need to look like they're doing something and giving a sh*t, so they arbitrarily pick out things like steroids and ephedra, neither of which have ANY conclusive evidence that moderate use is harmful in any way.|`|0dT5N38Saa	Serious health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of anabolic steroids. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage, and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart.<br>  <br>  Ergogenic uses for anabolic steroids in sports and bodybuilding is controversial, because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain an advantage conventionally considered "unfair." Their use is considered doping and banned by all major sporting bodies. For many years the AAS have been by far the most detected doping substances in IOC-accredited laboratories. In countries where AAS are controlled substances, there is often a black market in which smuggled or even counterfeit drugs are sold to users. In those countries some have called for less regulation because of those health risk and corresponding civil rights issues.

IOioIq1caa	If it is cramps then I have found that anything with heat works wonders...for example a hot bath, hot tea, or even placing a heating pad on your stomach (heating pads have saved me from some very painful hours!) also take some pain medicine (like midol)<br>  Bananas are also said to help cramps but i'm not sure if they work.<br>  Excercise is also recommended but whenever I was cramping exercise was the last thing on my mind! lol<br>  <br>  anyways hope this helps ^-^|`|hGEZ0b4Zaa	It is probably just your period. I always get major cramps before I get my actual period.<br>  <br>  Also, It could be a cyst in your ovaries if it is near or above your ovaries. If you are really worried about it go to a gynecologist. <br>  <br>  For now, just take advil or midol. This may sound gross but if you masturbate with or without someone, your cramps will lighten up. My doctor told me that when I had really bad cramps<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better!

MhpccWpmaa	they usually give you an exam and do a pap smear before they prescribe you a pill.

I'm sorry to say, you will have to go through the thrills of a pelvic exam. Its part of being a woman, and sadly, if you're on birth control its something you have to do every year.<br>  fourth..they may also do a breast exam, depending on what age you are, to check for any lumps or inconsistancies. Again. Not fun but normal.<br>  fifth...PLEASE feel comfortable enough with your dr to discuss ANY problems/concerns you might have with them. Thats what they're there for. They're not there to judge or critisize. They'll give you sound advise, and whether you take it or not is up to you.
DjiMcA53aa	Have you asked God to take care of you and your children? Have faith and be courageous even if your world is falling apart. If you do have to go to a shelter, say to yourself : This is the best I can do today.Tomorrow, my father in heaven will take care of us. Believe it with all your heart and be cheerful and strong for your kids. It's only a matter of time before Jesus sends his blessings to you. Believe in miracles, if you have faith under these terrible circumstances, God will reward you richly, and you'll aways remember His love after the tough times are over.

YEd9Q5KZaa	I don't know how people stay awake.

Plus worry about getting children raised, educated & out on their own some day, hoping God will let him live long enough to see it through.  Other than that, I don't see what could be the reason he might drift off to sleep afterwards.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	The first few minutes following an orgasm are really crucial. If you can keep him interested for those few minutes, then he should be able to stay awake.|`|IM3QwSS2aa	it's like a ritual - men will fall asleep after sex.  when they ejaculate, it's like draining a car battery of it energy.    some kind of chemicals are released causing sleepiness, drowsiness.    /jerome|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I also experience this (the sleeping after sex part, not the having a husband part).

So just find a way to keep him..er...up...for a little, and see if you can take this thing into overtime!  (note, oral sex is a great way to do this, but I realize not everyone is into doing that, experiment a bit and you'll come up with something that works!)

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	If eating rice made you fat, then obesity would be a real problem in the orient, don't you think?  Rice does contain calories, of course- it is primarily a starch that the body can covert to sugar pretty easily.   Brown and white rice are both the same, brown rice just has the bran coat intact so you get fiber and nutrients along with the starch.  Generally it's not eating rice that is the problem- it's what you eat along with the rice or on top of it that is.  It's the same as with potatos.  A bowl of rice itself is pretty bland, so folks eat it with other foods or dump gravy or butter on it.   And that is where the majority of the calories come from.  It wasn't the rice, it was everything else and too much of it that was the problem   Weight gain is still from eating too much of anything, not from one thing in particular.   Rice has a proper place in a well balanced diet, and if you are trying to lose weight it's the overall total calorie intake that counts.  It's not so much what you eat, but how much you eat that counts.  So if you like rice, eat it.  Just watch what you eat with it, and how much.|`|M5xsfUtwaa	They mean white rice. Wild rice and brown rice are healthy carbs.|`|w7o6qb9saa	Yes. But you can eat brown rice. I don't like the taste, but I got use to it.
NhF9sM5jaa	This is something that you need to talk about with your doctor. Your doctor can discuss with you the reason why you are going on birth control, and what option is right for you based on what hormones and how large of a dosage you need.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|xdyM3IVmaa	SUCK IT UP.     And eat your apples.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

It's hardest when you feel sad for no apparent reason.  Ride it through.  Those moments will pass just like everything else.

WXExyAlWaa	No it's not abuse, but it is unfair. I have noticed the same thing in my family, my father can be quite unfair to my little brother, and then my little brother gets defensive around my dad and it just keeps going. This situation sounds a bit worse than in my family though. I think someone really needs to sit down with your dad and find out what he's thinking when he favours your sister over you, and it needs to be when everyone's not worked up and emotional.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	Yes its a form of abuse you need to sit down with both your parent and tell them how you feel try to do it when your sister isnt there or she will just try to stop and interrupt you all the time.|`|UDwbU66eaa	I feel really sad for you - I can relate only too well. This is a form of emotional and mental abuse (and also physical if he touches you in anger). There must be someone in your life you can confide in. It would take a lot of courage and confidence to stand up to your father and I don't think you have that right now. And standing up to him is not what you need to do. You may be able to find some way of improving your assertiveness? If you feel he would listen, you could always choose to explain to your dad how much his behavior towards you hurts your heart so much?? Maybe you could write him a letter? I hope it works out for you.|`|CYzTJIhVaa	You may be being abused, not physically but emotionally.  If your father is calling you a rude little ***** then your environment doesn't sound too healthy emotionally.  Perhaps talking to your parents and telling them how you feel will help.  It may be difficult to do but at least give it a try.  I went through the same thing with my step father except he actually used to hit me.  if you speak with your parents and it still doesn't help you may need to seek outside help, maybe from someone at school.  It just has to be someone you trust.  I hope this was helpful!|`|AA10626996	okay , this kind of situation has a few ways that it can be handled. For one , dad needs something to de stress himself after work. This is something that mom should be handling. If she knows he is stressed, then she should step in and make sure he relaxes awhile .   Number 2... To end the problem w/ fights over things , your mom should not just hand it to you all and say chose what you all want. That's just inviting trouble.    3 How old is your sister?? Sibling Rivalry is a common thing when you have siblings. I have 3 brothers and when we were younger , my 2 youngest brothers fought like cats and dogs.    4 I know that when a parent prefers one child over the other , it hurts. I went through that and to be honest w/ you unless  your dad figures this out ( he can if mom would help him) it will not change.   My mom still favors the oldest and the youngest boys in my family although our relationship has gotten better.    5 You said the bad words. I understand that your sister wouldn't stop and sometimes siblings will do that just to get a rise out of the other one. You have to keep your cool .    6 Your dad heard you say the words not your sister so he responded by slapping your leg. Of course , your dad is in the wrong too because he turns around and uses foul language after he got onto you about it.      7 My biggest concern here is whether you are afraid of your dad or not. Are you afraid when it's time for him to come home?    8 Do you feel your dad loves you ?   9 Does your dad hug you ?   10 Does he say he loves you?    I am not saying this is abuse because I am not a psychiatrist or a counselor. I  can only go on what I have experienced as a child/ teen and from  what you have said here.     VERY IMPORTANT> It's not your fault. Your are 15 and that's a hard time for girls and guys but you do have to be responsible to a point okay. :)    Th depression you feel is from the way your dad treats you . How he responds to you .  I had the same problem growing up. I was always so tense and depressed because my mom favored my brothers over me. I took a lot of blame that I should  not have received.     I would say go talk to your counselor but now a days ,counselor 's don't do anything but help you w/ your school schedules unless you have one you can talk to. If you do, go talk to him/her. That is the one thing that kept me sane during my teens is that I had a great counselor.     I am not sure what else I can say.It's hard being a teen . It's hard when no one seems to understand. It's even harder when one parent shows favoritism . Girls go through a tremendous amount of change .     I will say one thing that will help you hold on.     When you grow up and you are on your own , you will be wiser and able to handle the world better than your sister. You will be the one that can weather storms when they hit your path. Your sister being protected like that is going to have a rough time.     Really when you think about it , you should feel bad for your sister. She has no idea what lies outside of those home doors  and maybe right now you don't either but when the time comes to find out , you will be stronger. I know this for a fact because I was stronger and now my brothers come to me :) to help them.   They don't talk to my mom. They talk to me. I am the strong one. I have weathered the storm.       BUT something to also remember: If this situation between you and your dad ever gets out of control , get help. I don't care how ,cops, anyone who will listen because abuse is wrong and if left unnoticed , it can get bad.    Now that doesn't mean go out and talk to a cop just because you are pissed at your sister okay. This is real and this could affect your whole family if you bring it to the front. Make absolutely sure that it is abuse.   100% sure.   I wish there was something else I could say ...  I wish you well little one and I hope that what I have said helps you .   You are in my prayers :)|`|6afa558f5f7db4c42e087d9a9cac01b7aa	i  think  it  was  very  wrong  for  you  father  to  call  you  a  *****..  you  are  not  a  *****  but  his  daugther  and  both  of  you  should  be  treated  the  same ..|`|GgZPyHLkaa	ok. i don't think it's abuse,, but its defenetly WRONG. he should never favour your sister over you!! i say you should get some balls and SPEAK OUT!!  go to your gran's house if you have too! you should put an end to this!
IV6aRyI7aa	If the shot you are referring to an antibitic shot, then yes, it is gonna be a tad painful.  Sorry but thats the truth. It wont hurt for  long time tho, maybe 20-30 minutes...And no its not going to go in your arm, is has to be in a large muscle. The arm isnt big enough, it will hurt less in the butt anyway.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	It depends on the person really. My mother had it and she didn't mind it, but I had it and I am very very scared of needles, so I think all needles hurt no matter how tiny. Based off what I learned in psychology if you just don't think about the pain and think about something happy you will not feel the pain as much, how ever this didn't help for me. ha. I still have to take a tranquilizer before any shots.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	Not really, just a little stick . . . like a small ant bite.

If you eat healthy and exercise then you should be an average weight.

YqayaySoaa	Chances are you are hurting because you are on the computer 24/7! Also I very highly doubt it that you have a blood clot. I mean you admit that you are a hypochondriac right? So don't you think that you could be worrying yourself over nothing? My advice is since you seem like you are way stressed out about your pain is make an appointment with your regular doctor. Why do you need your parents permission? You are 18. I would also ask the doctor about antidepressants/axienty medications to help you deal with life since you think you are a hypochondriac. Am not a doctor or anything it's just what I think.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Calm down.  If you are concerned about blood clots take an aspirin.  And have a cup of tea.  Aspirin thins the blood and tea dilates (widens) blood vessels.  I have pains in my legs all the time.  I think it's from celiac disease.  There can be many causes of a symptom, including taking a walk.  Really you worry too much.  Take fish oil and magnesium.  Maybe this will ease the anxiety.|`|iXyma5Ouaa	did anyone tell you what Hyprocondria is? It is when a person fells that any little thing that happens is an Illness. Most off the time there is not much wrong and everything will be fine if you give up and dont worry about it.<br>  As far your pain, anyone that walks four miles without being used to it will hurt. Blood clots at your age are rare and most of the time they dont hurt like that. Stop your worry and get some sleep you need time to rest so you get rid the pain from walking.|`|oX7M4FoIaa	Females do have a groin area. Also, the reason you are in pain is because you don't usually walk that far a distance everyday. Take it easy. Walk maybe a mile a day or a maile and a half each day. Also, try not to spend too much time at the comp. Don't over exert yourself with the walkin or you will always be sore!|`|T0pXwNCkaa	GO TO THE DOCTOR PLS!PLS!PLS<br>  They need to check it sounds to me like one but i cant be sure|`|I0TrT0Mwaa	Yeah I know what hypochondria is. I threat about appendicitis, epiglottitus, heart attacks, anyuerisms and stuff all the time. But this one seemed.<br>  <br>  To the person that suggested tea. Vein opening? And if it just so happens to be a blood clot it'd open it and it'd go to the lung...<br>  <br>  To the people that said it was just walking pain. Why was the groin pain part only on the left side then? I walked with both legs why not both sides?<br>  <br>  And if that's not clot pain can you explain what is?
YRJShhKraa	Yes, it does sound like you have anorexia, but you need to go to a doctor to get diagnosed, and most importantly help! Those are all the classic first signs, once starvation from anorexia sets in. I experienced many of your symptoms, plus more severe one's before I decided to get help. You need to get help now! Don't let it get worse! I'm going to lie to you, recovery is not fun at all at first, but once you achieve recovery it makes all your struggles worthwhile! Please get help!

3QIWdvG1aa	What is mononucleosis?<br>  <br>  Mononucleosis, also called “mono,” is a common viral illness that can leave you feeling tired and weak for weeks or months. Mono goes away on its own, but lots of rest and good self-care can help you feel better.<br>  What causes mono?<br>  <br>  Mono is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is most often seen in adolescents and young adults. Children can get the virus, but it often goes unnoticed because their symptoms are mild. Adults usually do not get mono, because they have immunity to the virus.<br>  <br>  Mono can be spread through contact with saliva, mucus from the nose and throat, and sometimes tears. Because the virus can be spread through kissing, it has earned the nickname the “kissing disease.” If you have mono, you can avoid passing the virus to others by not kissing anyone and by not sharing things like glasses, eating utensils, or toothbrushes.<br>  <br>  As soon as you get over mono, your symptoms will go away for good, but you will always carry the virus that caused it. The virus may become active from time to time without causing any symptoms. When the virus is active, it can be spread to others.<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms of mono are a high fever, a severe sore throat, swollen glands and tonsils, and weakness and fatigue. Symptoms usually start 4 to 6 weeks after you are exposed to the virus.<br>  <br>  Mono can cause the spleen to swell. Severe pain in the upper left part of your belly may mean that your spleen has burst. This is an emergency.<br>  How is mono diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and examine you. You may also need blood tests to check for signs of mono (monospot test) and the Epstein-Barr virus. Blood tests can also help rule out other causes of your symptoms.<br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  Usually only self-care is needed for mono.<br>  <br>      * Get plenty of rest. You may need bed rest, which could keep you away from school or work for a little while.<br>      * Gargle with salt water or use throat lozenges to soothe your sore throat.<br>      * Take acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil) to reduce fever and relieve a sore throat and headaches.<br>      * Avoid contact sports and heavy lifting. Your spleen may be enlarged, and impact or straining could cause it to burst.<br>  <br>  In severe cases, medicines called corticosteroids may be used to reduce swelling of the throat, tonsils, or spleen.|`|K1pdOCMDaa	Kissing is the most prevalent way of getting it. It comes from the saliva of someone else who has it and will last for 3-4 weeks. Once you have mono you will also test positive for EB. It is a virus you will have with you for the rest of your life though the occurance of mono usually only happens once. <br>  Once you have been infected with EBV, your body may periodically shed (or give off) the virus throughout your lifetime, possibly spreading the virus to others. 2 This can occur despite the fact that you do not have symptoms after your initial mono infection; the virus may still be found in your saliva many months after you have recovered from your symptoms. Some newly infected people may not have any symptoms of mono and may not be aware they are spreading the virus that causes mono.The virus has a long incubation period and sometimes won't show symptoms until 30 to 60 days after ... Your body will tell you when it's time to rest, so listen to it.

Most doctors, nutritionists, and other experts don't rely on it either.|`|emx3HJSIaa	i'll tell you how, very unfairly.<br>  now i'm a guy, but i know girls always stress about their weight, even the skinny ones. <br>  <br>  don't trust bmi, as it is designed for the average person. and hell its not even the average person. its assumes they do no exercises and, in the case of women, have no boobs.<br>  <br>  like i'm not a small guy or thin guy.<br>  i'm 6'3"     35" waist      and 225lbs. i work out alot, i can run far and lift well above average for long periods of time.<br>  in short i'm above average strength (yet far from body builder)<br>  i have a bmi of over 30, it says i'm obese.<br>  <br>  i look at the mirror, and i got some fat on me, but i don't have a belly, maybe a bump if i'm fool of food.<br>  <br>  <br>  here is a trick i learned, when you look at the mirror, don't look at your stomach (it is going to seem way bigger than it is)<br>  get in a good posture (shoulders should be parallel with ground. if your not used to it, it will almost feel like your leaning backwards. trust me, its how your meant to be, it not only makes your stomach look flatter, but it is healthier for your back)<br>  look at you body, start head to toe. <br>  do you seem proportional?<br>  what image do you want?<br>  do you look overweight?<br>  while in your posture, put your hand on sides, thumb underneath ribcage fingers above waist. bring them close together to pinch your fat. <br>  was it easy to grab hold of?<br>  is there more than an inch? <br>  <br>  i hope i can help. <br>  its weird for me being a guy and having such low esteem about my appearance. i can't really shake it, but i know a lil bout psychology, and i'm trying to get a realistic image of myself.<br>  <br>  our bodies are tools and designed for things, mostly inherited by our ancestors.<br>  it may make more sense for men, but women with "hips" and "large boobs" are from a maternal line.<br>  meaning your ideal for child bearing, you have room for it to grow and plenty of "food" storage. <br>  skinny women probably came from a more survivalist line,|`|r3Rr8Ucfaa	Being overweight is completely different to being obese. Like mentioned above, weightlifters would be considered very overweight on a BMI, but they are in no means 'fat'. Im sure you're spot on.|`|MAMYF3OCaa	i heard a D cup weighs about 10lbs. so just subtract and see what your BMI comes out.
Gg7wc3Wpaa	Awesome. I'm currently trying to lose weight. Already lost 31 and needing to lose 28 more. I've found that serving sizes are a big deal. I know it's such a bother sometimes but it does help to count calories and measure food. Even just learning what 1/4, or 1/3 or a whole cup looks like can help so that, after a while, you wont have to break out the measuring cups/spoons.<br>  <br>  As far as food I try to eat as many all natural foods as possible. Here is an example of what I'll eat for a day<br>  <br>  Breakfast<br>  1/4 cup yogurt<br>  1/4 cup granola<br>  1/2 cup blueberries<br>  coffee with nonfat creamer<br>  <br>  Lunch<br>  Turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread with one slice of cheese, tomoato, lettuce, 1tblspoon mustard<br>  Single serving bag of chips (those little individual ones that you buy in bulk)<br>  Carrots, or some other veggie<br>  <br>  Dinner<br>  1/4 cup rice<br>  Chicken breat (size of fist)<br>  side of spinach salad with fat free italian dressing and croutons<br>  veggie like green beans<br>  <br>  For snacks I'll eat...<br>  <br>  Light string cheese<br>  fruit (apple, orange, avacado, etc)<br>  one seving of applesauce with 1/4 cup cottage cheese)<br>  pudding cup (Kozy Shack brand)<br>  <br>  Finally, a great workout is the Tae-bo series by Billy Blanks<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

FLeEdSTxaa	First of all, don't use drugs. Second of all, it's not that being overweight is ugly, it's just unhealthy. Third of all, what I do to get myself motivated for anything is to compare myself to someone else. For example, I see my friends going through hard times, but they still make better grades than me, and it motivates me to do better. So, you can find someone who has your same disorder and see how they succeed at losing weight, and it'll probably motivate you to do better than that person. Everyone is different though, but I'm just telling you what works for me. :- )|`|AA11629848	The best motivator is the mirror, and don't stop exercising until you can see your pubes without bending over. Take pics in underwear (keep them safe) to have a comparison from "Before" and "After". With time you'll see the difference <br>  <br>  I'm 6'3" and was 280, I was disgusted with my reflection and needed to lean forward to see "it". Now, 4 months later I'm 244 and keep exercising, my goal is 220, less than that I look kinda sick (like a junkie). So, look at yourself in the mirror (naked is shocking but works) and take action.|`|AtjlmByAaa	Hi, I know your feelings, its really hard so am I had this emotion.  but you know, unless you do something, you won't get out of this problem and you're gonna be hooked deeper and deeper.<br>  So first, remember, people who succeed at weight loss recognize the deceit of diets and no longer choose to be victimized. Lack of exercise is one factor which contributes to one person's being idle.  Develop a burning desire, in a challenge to reach a goal, there is only one way to move: Forward. It's not just a physical challenge but an emotional too.  Think of your discipline, decide that today is the day you will seek progress, not perfection in your program of permanent weight loss.<br>  Give yourself time, it took you a while to put on weight, and it will take time to make it go away.<br>  Get your body moving, but do it gently and easily.  Exercise will do wonders for your body and for your emotional state.<br>  Don't let the popular culture decide what you should look like.  You make the decision and then stick with the nutritional plan that works best for you.  Remember, "YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH IT TO GET TO IT"|`|7HSGZhOAaa	When I go through a phase of not being motivated to work I find it helps to try a couple of different kinds of classes and see which one I'm in the mood for at the time.  Going to fitness classes keeps me motivated because they go by so fast and you don't even realize how hard you are working, plus everyone is in the same boat and working hard together which is always motivating.  I've gone through yoga phases, step aerobics phases, and spinning phases.  It definitely motivates me to work out when I have a membership to a fitness club with nice bathroom facilities too because it feels great to have a nice hot shower after a work out and not have to worry about bringing things like a towel and shampoo/conditioner, soaps etc.<br>  Hope that helps :)|`|Gg7wc3Wpaa	Seriously, you are not ugly or defined by your weight. Motivation for exercise is so hard. Im currently having that problem. I know it sounds funny, but you know when something amazing to you happens and you get that burst of "happy" energy.

I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!

L63BRwXbaa	if you're using an applicator, push the applicator in until your fingers are against your vagina, then push the barrel in, that will be far enough, if you are not using an applicator, push it in with your index or middle finger as far as you can, it won't go too far, don't worry about it getting "lost" either, cause it can't. try pulling on the string to make sure that you'll be able to get it out later, and leave it in for a few hours, then try pulling it out, if it hurts, leave it in for a bit more, when it is completely saturated, it will come out easily, as the blood will lubricate it, and wear a pantyliner to not stain your panties, if you have to leave it in for more than 6 hours, switch to a lower absorbancy,<br>  and talk to your mom or a trusted adult about this<br>  congrats on getting your period by the way

ieO15Ir2aa	It sounds like you have bacterial vaginosis.  The classic symptoms area really strong odor and having watery clear/white/grayish discharge which would explain why your underwear become soaked from it.  The only way to treat this is to go to the doctor where they will prescribe you Flagyl which is a pill you take twice a day for a week that clears it up.  I know it's embarassing and makes you feel self-conscious, believe me I've been there, but it's actually more common than a yeast infection in women. Just go to the doctors asap|`|s1gEHdBgaa	Yes, as they said, see a doctor and get tested, it could be an STD|`|4onT0qUxaa	It is probably a bacterial infection. You will need antibiotics to clear it up. It could also be an STD, which is just as easily treated. Either way, you will have to be examined by a Dr. where they will take a sample and put it on a slide (called a wet mount) and look at it under the microscope to check the cause. Make an appointment tomorrow, or go to the ER right away. Things like that, if left untreated, can lead to permanent damage of your reproductive organs, leaving you unable to have children. Why risk it? GO GET CHECKED!!|`|UMvB3fzsaa	you need to see a doctor.<br>  Even if the discharge is white, a strong odor or anything else that isn't typical needs to get checked out.  <br>  I'd also discontinue the baby powder, it may irritate you further.

oFUljjhnaa	This is certainly a real and most serious concern and we'll be seeing more and more reports as time goes on, as the true effects start to materialise. The thing to remember is that cordless as with mobile phones have only started being used extensively in the last 12 or so years. It will take time for any definitive effects to become apparent. (typically 10 - 20 years), therefore anyone who says that they are not harmfull is doing so without any real knowledge or understanding!<br>  <br>  The fact is that radio frequency (RF) transmissions are DANGEROUS. As to how dangerous, well that all depends on the intensity and duration of exposure. No one really knows and those that say it is not a problem, have no evidence to substantiate that it is not, infact there is more evidence coming to light to say that it is a potentially real serious problem! Any possible adverse effects that these devices have on human tissue, should not be taken lightly! It is still early days and time will tell as it did for smoking, asbestos related products and countless of chemicals and herbacides, in the past. <br>  The simple fact is that everyone should be aware that the longer you use the phone the greater the adverse affects are likely to be. There is no doubt whatsoever, and it is well documented that high levels of RF are DANGEROUS! Cell phones and to a lesser extent DECT phones such as your cordless home phone, transmit at much lower energy levels, but their consistant and prolonged use may well have a cumalitive effect. <br>  <br>  Although there is no proof to indicate that mobile phones can cause cancer, there is more and more doubt being cast, suficient debate and more studies happening to cause doubt as to the relative safety. As a telecommunications engineer I am aware of the power density levels produced by mobile phones and the effect they can have on different people. <br>  Mobile and cordless home phones transmit using radio frequency radiation (RFR). These are radio waves located within the electromagnetic spectrum. X-rays which are known to cause cancer through ionizing radiation are also within the electromagnetic spectrum, however, RFRs cannot cause cancer in the same way as x-rays because RFRs are non-ionizing.<br>  <br>  However, high levels of RFRs can cause health effects through heating the human body (thermal effects), resulting in headaches and possibly other symptoms, such as you are experiencing. <br>  <br>  Whilst it cannot be shown at this point in time that the thermal effects from mobile phones are a health hazard there is a considerable body of scientific literature which describes the effects of RFR in biological systems that cannot be directly attributed to heating. These effects are referred to as non-thermal and have been demonstrated to cause alteration in animal behaviour, or changes in the functioning of cell membranes.<br>  <br>  A bit more credible reading can be found here;|`|AA12249359	There is no conclusive evidence either for or against the harmful effects of mobile phone use and its links to brain tumours. <br>  <br>  Some people say 'yes', some say 'no'.

GJKsizL7aa	Prostates are tested various ways.  The most common is the DRE digital rectal exam - where the doctor feels the outside of your prostate through your rectal wall.<br>  <br>  The prostate is also checked through blood testing by checking for PSA and Free PSA.<br>  <br>  If problems are suspected, ultrasound, cytoscope, and/or biopsies are often performed.|`|72iZuDjeaa	testing a prostate?? hummm.... examining the prostate is the finger up da wazoo...  if your testing one i think you would need to orgasm,,, and i think that test they send you to a small room with a magazine and a specimen cup|`|zMD0VeOmaa	the doctor takes a gloved hand and sticks it up your rectum. The purpose of the exam is to find out if you have any prostate enlargement or any signs of prostate cancer.<br>  <br>  Also, there is a lab test they can do called a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. This is a tumor marker than when elevated in the blood may be a sign that prostate cancer is present. generally, your 1st prostate exam is recommended at 40 years of age that way the doctor can find cancer in the early stages before it has had a chance to metastasize(spread) to other parts of the part.|`|AA10327722	A finger up your butt, seriously thats how.

tBaCFTtBaa	okay, i know a lot about nursing homes, but not a lot about the rights of social workers.  my husband was in the hospital for 5 months (in the icu) and in a nursing home for 9 months, and then home for 2 years until he passed away last year.. the nursing home was so terrible.. boy, do i have stories to tell!  anyway, keep her out of it if you can.  i agree that she has the right to decide where to live and i dont think they can "make" anyone go to a nursing home.. they can only suggest.  if you, and she, feel that it is best to stay home and receive care, do it.  you can have nurses come to the house on a daily basis or have sitters.. medicaid/medicare or whatever she may have should cover is 100%.  good luck and God Bless!|`|HeB9M5lgaa	It would help to know what state this is in. They can not force her to go to a nursing home unless they can prove the accomodations at her/your home are not acceptable. Are you adequately (or anyone who will be there) trained to take care of her? Believe it or not even just being partially paralyzed there are proper procedures as to how to do the necessities for her. She will also need regular exercises. It will be a lot of work and most social workers worry about the burn out and resentment that can occur which then lead to elder abuse. There are options though. Is she in a nursing home rehab? if so, that is one major reason why the social worker is trying to get you to let her there is a money issue. Also if its a hospital they are just lazy and to send someone home (especially if they get help to care for the elderly)its alot of paperwork for the state. Now to receive help. This is hard to say because it varies. I am in PA here if she is over 60 and meets income requirements she would be eligible for whats called a PDA waiver. It is monitored through Area Agency on Aging (if you have an AAA contact them and ask about personal care services) Then how it works is you choose a company they send in an aide who will help your grandma so many days a week so many hours a week (they tell you how many hours shes allowed in a week which depends on her need then you can set the hours and days of your choice as long as its consistent) Then the department of welfare pays the company. you will owe nothing. Now, even if she is not eligible for that one there are so many more waiver programs for different income levels and different need levels (PDA is just very common for the elderly). Your state representatives could even point you in the right direction.  Now if you have the extra help the social worker will give you less of a hassle. How you talk to a social worker is simply tell them that you will not have her in a nurisng home you don't wnat her there and she doesn't want to be there. There is nothing the home can do for her that you can't provide. Remind her that it is your grandmothers right to choose where she wants to be and if that creates such a problem then she needs to contact your lawyer. (Get a lawyer if you need too. There are legal services available if you can't afford a lawyer.) Good luck. If you are in PA email me with your county and I can give you some contacts. Good luck.

naPq2mbtaa	Stretch marks often appear on bodies that have recently gone through a great deal of growth or change: pregnancy, sudden weight gain or loss, and, yes, puberty. (Think about the lines like those you see in taffy when it's stretched: the same thing happens to the skin when it gets pulled in a new direction.) On teenagers stretch marks usually show up on parts of the body like the hips and breasts because those are places that experience the most change and rapid expansion during puberty.<br>  <br>  Stretch marks usually start off as violet or pink lines, but eventually fade to spiderweb-thin, silvery lines. Sometimes they can be more noticeable when you're tan, because they can either burn or stay pale while the rest of your skin darkens.<br>  <br>  Some people use cocoa butter or vitamin E oil to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, but there's no proof that these remedies work. Retin-A, the medicine that is often used for treating acne has shown some promise of reducing early stretch marks. The only hitch is that you have to get a prescription from your doctor.<br>  <br>  It may be comforting to know that many women have stretch marks-- and even some men have them too. However pronounced and noticeable they may seem to you now, they do fade over time.|`|AA10465478	when your that young skin is still very elastic, exercise and diet, get some cream stuff.  your young|`|r7yaD6Axaa	I'm in middle skool <br>  <br>  well if u hav strecth marks its really hard to get off <br>  <br>  how about just go to a doctor and ask for a cream <br>  <br>  sometimes if u hav stretch mark becuz of ur body so go in excersise<br>  <br>  anywasy thats d only  ting i know of<br>  <br>  <br>  well good luck|`|mW1nN8Ojaa	You are young, just exercise and you will be fine.

AA10224643	Sounds like you might have some kind of funk going on.  If you let it go it could spread into our kidneys which is super painful and can be dangerous.  Your best bet would be to eat the $200 and see a doctor.  If you absolutely can't then you can try an over the counter med called Cystex.  It will help to detain it for awhile and also will help with the pain.  Don't look at it as a cure though, as soon as you return home please do see your doctor.|`|casg30Ataa	get some AZO and drink cranberry juice|`|57j6hSjNaa	Your symptoms certainly sound like you have a bladder infection. Feeling the sensation to urinate and nothing comes out and the burning sensation..<br>  <br>  I would suggest drinking alot of water and all natural cranberry juice. It helps clear the urinary tract.. It may not cure the problem, but it will help alot.. I would suggest finding a free clinic in your families area and paying a small fee.. <br>  <br>  I don't know your situation, but I would just go ahead and pay the $200 to see a doctor, because UTI are treated with antibiotics. Your going to continue to feel uncomfortable and if you wait to long, the infection could spread to your kidneys and cause other problems with your urinary system. <br>  <br>  So don't put a price on your health..Unless your going home within a cpl days...<br>  <br>  Good Luck !
acWyJ3t0aa	As long as you are running and doing upper body type maxes , everything will be fine . I would not max on any leg type max and then run . Just keep your weight training days and running days to Bench , Incline ,<br>  then run . If you are going to max on the power clean and the squat , then I would do it on days where I was running dashes like the 440 and down .<br>  I would try to alternate the days that I lifted to upper body and long runs because your legs are fresh and lower body and short sprints like I said above .|`|AtjlmByAaa	Hi, running is a cardio vascular exercise and is one form of warm up exercises, so it should go first, then after you can do the lifting.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

rzBxRw7Haa	If this has been going on for a month you should see your doctor. Whilst reading symptoms on the web can give you an idea of what may be wrong it can also cause so much worry thinking have I got this or have I got that. Take a sample of urine to you doctor and he will e#be able to do some simple tests immediately with a test strip and will be able to see if you have an infection etc. Depending on what he finds he will then proceed with either a simple prescription for antibiotics or further tests if this is necessary.

yE2vM76naa	That's an old wives tale, and one I wish that would die out.  There are folks who will say "the citric acid in it acidifies the urine and kills bacteria" um, if that were the case that acids killed bacteria, lemon juice would make a great antibiotic. Its not because your body is going to use that citric acid as a transporter in several of these processes (most sugar conversion) and it will never hit your bladder as citric acid...  http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http...    Try an awful lot of cranberry juice extract capsules (not ocean spray, thats only 27% juice and not strong enough for what you want), and if after 24 hours you see no improvement plan on seeing a medical care practionioner.    There is a very specific compound (d-mannose) in cranberry that prevents bacteria from adhering to the bladder walls. If you catch a bladder infection early enough it can help, but once you are past a certain point, there is already too much bacteria on the bladder walls for your immune system to handle, and you need to call in the calvary.     Hope you feel better soon - those things really suck|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	No.  Buy cranberry tablets at walgreens and double up|`|NmOQy10saa	Cranberry Juice is good for bladder infections.|`|AA11397003	no, you need medicine|`|GPBJxbWlaa	Cranberry juice only coats the lining of the badder and will not kill the infection.

'keeping it under control' is not having god damn anorexia, its called a diet  OR wannarexia  which is ******* ridiculous  the answer is no  if i could be over 110 pounds without wanting to die, i would do it in a heart beat.  except my heartbeat is so slow because of malnutrition, that that might take a little longer.  jesus christ, i can't see why ANYBODY would want an eating disorder.  that really pisses me off|`|LiOOF1Plaa	HELL NO......look at what it did to highly-talented Karen Carpenter?    Change your thinking about food- and never worry about overeating ever again.|`|U0KzxpJfaa	Ehhhh.... obviously not!!!    ANOREXIA (note spelling) is a disease a mental illness, that people die from!!!    The question you're asking is stopping your periods, possibly not being able to have children, growing a layer of hair all over your body, losing friends and family because all you care about is being skinny, passing out, having no social life and even dying worth it???    This is a sick joke.....    Get yourself some help!!!|`|8cDd70dSaa	Are you willing to literally die just to lose a few pounds?    If so, then yes. If you value your image more than your life, go right ahead!|`|WXExyAlWaa	No. Even if you don't get bad enough to be hospitalised, it's not just the physical effects - the psychological effects last a lifetime. People can have been recovered for ten years and still struggle with it.|`|7pMtGpoiaa	idk but i'm seriously thinking about it|`|aIHSmRYwaa	I'm going to be honest with you;Yes, I do think it's worth it, if you keep it under control. My personal goal weight to get to is 100 lbs. I am around 130 now. I'm 5'4''.    All you need to do to hide it is just drink a lot of water while eating meals around your family/friends.     Go to the Pro-Ana websites. You'll get better tips there.    Good luck!!|`|TC00nL07aa	Its only worth it if you wanna end up losing your life and hurting other people!|`|4dQjVb59aa	No cuz who gives a crap about weight food is awesome!!!!|`|U6C4Bywwaa	you're an idiot.  Anorexia is not a weight loss program. It's a sick mental disorder.

I know someone that was anorexic and she said that you get hair all over ur body, and it is so disgusting. it just not worth it please dont do it. email me at pugdog321@aol.com for more advice.|`|5sHcB4wuaa	no anorexia will damage your body, and other people will find you unattractive, i really hate how the modern day models look, its disgusting really, i mean they look like cloth hangers, they might as well just show those clothes off on cloth hangers it wouldn't be much different, if you have problems with body fat, you should consider going to gym, you will not see results at first, but do not give up. Most people give up because they do too much too soon and overwork their bodies and get hurt, it takes about 4 - 6 months to see some real progress, as long as you follow:  Frequency - how often  Intensity - how hard are your workouts  Time - give it time, you don't become overweight in 1 week, so dont expect to lose weight in 1 week|`|1gsVXIXmaa	Anorexia* is not worth it. This comes from a 10 year sufferer.

You and your boyfriend should go get tested for STD's.|`|Xrvutzmdaa	stop having sex ur not married !!!!!!!|`|kdh46X95aa	It can be sexually transmitted, carbonated beverages, and unprotected sex. Maybe you need to get checked out.|`|jImcYB11aa	You need to urinate after intercourse to rid your body of sperm and ejaculate that may have entered your urethra.  This will help prevent a UTI.  But this might not be the only reason.  I would consult with your medical doctor.        P.S. You should also wait until you are married to have sexual intercourse, as just an after thought.
DDswEgtZaa	usually they confirm it with an EKG.  if so they may do testing like a 24 hour holter monitor to see how long you are in the irregular rhythm.  This is because when your heart flutters like that it tends to pool blood in the upper chamber of your heart and can cause blood clot or stroke.  your MD would have to put you on an anticoagulant medication like plavix or coumadin.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	The previous poster has it right. An EKG will show irregular rate and rhythm which is diagnostic for A fib. The pulse may feel irregular however other conditions can cause irregularity of the pulse.   Here is more info on A fib:   http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/...|`|WadzK6ejaa	Definite diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is by EKG or ECG but by palpation you can feel irregular irregularity of heart beat
mW2HP40Raa	you can get it from dry and wet contact.     condoms are not a guarantee that you will not contract HPV, but they minimize the risk somewhat. cloth from boxers is not really a good barrier because the small holes in cloth are large compared to a small virus.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	There are several different strains of the HPV virus, genital warts can be spread without fluids.
yazZH4khaa	You need to see an internist.|`|kA0xb0MVaa	What tests did the hospital do for him?  And what were the results?  Did they do a CAT scan, MRI, blood tests?

Maybe you're flat footed and haven't even gotten the right shoes to help it.|`|gERaZGZeaa	While I started to read your question I thought "Flat Feet".  But then when you started describing a band - that sounds like you have some problems with your tendons.  Get to a doctor to give you a referral to a pedorthist - they are the guys who make orthotics and examine the mechanics of your feet.|`|42WmRqNoaa	Stretch before you do physical activity.|`|TsE5XhXoaa	no|`|Vbdfphhbaa	did you sprain your ankles at some point? sometimes a simple and slight trip can screw up your muscles tendons etc...best to check with your doctor...the  foot doctor or your physician...|`|tRUoj8cPaa	Normally this can happen if you have not exercise for a long time. Walk long distance at normal pace for a few days, may be twice per week for two weeks.     Third - fourth week- walk normal the same distance increasing your pace from time to time, if it is ok then continue for the next week.    Fifth - six week,- Walk normal, running from time to time    Hope this will work. Otherwise consult a doctor. good luck|`|tLxk3Q5caa	GO to see your doctor but, it could be a strained tendon or at the worst a strained Achilles tendon.|`|QQMQ4u70aa	hmm. you could have heel spurs. those are very painful and usually occur in people who run/jog alot.   or you could just be wearing the wrong shoes. if you dont have the correct shoes when youre running then that can make your feet and ankles hurt really really bad.|`|xzl9njBXaa	After your exercise start icing your ankles.Do ankle exercises to strenghten your ankles.Try to upgrade your footgear or try a softer terrain to walk/jog.
YW74O9aNaa	Do cardio exercises in the gym..or if the weather is good go for walks or bike a lot.   I'm also not much motivated to work out indoors. But I love biking :) i'm looking forward to spring and better warmer weather!|`|X0BuOqciaa	I was looking at some Darren Brown stuff earlier and funny enough I saw something that would suit you fine :)  A test was done between 3 controlled groups. One worked out down the gym 3 days a week for 3 months or something, the next carried on normally for 3 months and the final group listened to a CD and imagined working out to gain in strength.  The results were a 0% increase in strength for the normal group  28% increase for the group working out as expected really  and a 24% increase for the ones who barley lifted a finger but convinced their brains by listening to the Cd that they were working out.        So there you have it, convince yourself youre loosing weight and it will probably have the same kind of effect.|`|iX5vNy5aaa	Exercising helped me to lose loads of weight when I married it together it along with taking acai berry.

dF2SXJHyaa	that means you should stop smoking!  Smoking is highly unhealthy for you regardless of whether you puke or not, but obviously the puking should be a clear sign not to do it.|`|E3Lheqoeaa	That's your body trying to remove the toxins you're forcing into it. If you continue to smoke, the puking is going to stop, and you'll be "fine".|`|0b59c347b366439bc483ccb060f2eee5aa	The same thing happened to me when I first started smoking. I should of been wise enough to stop, but I didn't. Quit now why you can! Quitting later is not easy at all!
eS5VOgKfaa	HIV tends to be conical or spherical in appearance. This is due to the fact that it is 'encased' in host cell membrane when it leaves the cell after lysis. (HIV is enveloped). HIV- 1 certainly has a conical capsid. A lot of viruses are often represented as being polyhedral, or icoshedral or a mix.
mPrUYEDiaa	that's so horribly sad, and I am so sorry you have to deal with that. since I have had an alcoholic dad since I was 10 years old, and I am now 19, I know EXACTLY what you're going through. Since you can't talk to your dad, and you're too young to live on your own, I would suggest moving in with a relitive. is your grandma still alive? do you have any aunts of uncles you could live with? anyone? even if it's in another city, this would be best for you. you shouldn't have to deal with this, and I KNOW the damage it can do. Tell your dad, not your mom, that you cannot handle the stress you're put under and you are concerned about the affects it's having on you. tell him that you love him, and your family, but as long as your mother is behaving this way, you cannot go on living like this. if he loves you, and wants to help you, he'll let you go. if he doesn't, talk to your school counselor and they will locate a relative that can provide you a stable environment. i know you dont want to break up your family, but you have to consider what is best for YOU. your parents are adults, and they can handle themselves.....you, however, are too young to have to deal with such stress.<br>  <br>  good luck, and i hope everything goes well with you. :)|`|AA11850523	unfortunately you cant stop her from drinking<br>  you can change the way you respond to her problem<br>  go to a Alanon /alateen meeting <br>  <a href="http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/</a><br>  <br>  good luck|`|xnCizA7Daa	drink her under the table|`|evreIB4Gaa	i know what you mean my mom is like this to but you have to like talk to your dad about it and your mom when shes sober and in a good mood maybe AA or something but dont give up on her and tell your dad adn family that best of luck ill pray for you! good luck|`|Vx2hbHK8aa	uh sorry to hear that... ask her to get into rehab or have sum self control.|`|OleVPkJgaa	take her to AA?

Try one of those.<br>  <br>  Also, adjust your diet.  Gas is from digesting fiber (veggies, cereal, rice).  Try cutting down on them as well.  The last source is soda pop.

KToEYmwWaa	6 times a day is far too frequent.  You need to incorporate more salt and fat into your diet, and make sure you eat every few hours.  I had this same problem and went to the doctor and he told my my blood pressure was extremely low. Ever since I've been eating more salt and fat I have only been having spells like this a few times a week.  It was hard for me at first because I don't really like salty foods but it is worth it not to feel like you are going to black out every 5 minutes.|`|awpYls4Daa	hi there,<br>  <br>  i think it was caused by hypotension(low blood pressure).It occurs after a change in body position, typically when a person stands up from either a seated or lying position. the blood pressure drops and there'll be lack of oxygen supply to the brain and this causes other symptoms.im not sure if my assumption is correct or not but my advice to u is that it is good for u to refer a physician who can help u. physician knows more and have better knowledge about health issues. dont take it as light matter. pls tc and refer a physician as soon as possible.
E80A9WSXaa	Sounds like fun! Here's what I've found works to get ME in shape. Hopefully this will help you get started :) <br>  <br>  To loose weight you need to change two main things about your life:<br>  How much/How often you exercise<br>  Your diet<br>  <br>  It's healthy to work out at least 20 minutes everyday, and that means getting your heart pumping without slowing down for 20 minutes. This means you want to focus on cardio workouts such as running, jumping jacks, swimming, (etc.). <br>  I've found that swimming works the best because you're using the most amount of muscles at the same time and because the water's cold, you're burning fat just to stay warm!<br>  For different types of exercises you can go to <a href="http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/</a> sign up for free and you'll find a bunch of tips how to stay fit, including video demonstrations of specific workouts.<br>  <br>  Secondly, your diet. Eating healthy alone will help you shed those pounds because your body will be forced to burn fat instead of store it. <br>  Start by eating balanced meals that include protein, carbs, fiber, and as little fat as possible. Try not to over-do it on the carbs because carbs are energy and they get stored as fat pretty easy if you dont work it off. If you finish a balanced meal but you're STILL HUNGRY relax, this is natural we're just used to eating way too much. Go for some salad, fruit, or vegetables, because these things fill you up without weighing you down.<br>  When you feel you need a snack, eat fruit. Apples are good, peaches are very sweet if you have a candy craving and the BEST is to make a smoothie. I usually put in some cherries, banana, strawberries, blueberries, and grapes along with non-fat yogurt and ice (towards the end so it doesn't just end up as water).<br>  This may seem hard at first but if you can do it for a week, it gets easier from there--trust me!<br>  For more information on eating a balanced diet, you can visit <a href="http://www.mypyramid.gov/pyramid/index.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mypyramid.gov/pyramid/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You can email or message me if you have any questions<br>  Good luck!!|`|2ZoP0lZeaa	Hey, I recommend that you try Hypnotherapy!<br>  No, I'm not kidding you on this.  I used to weigh 198 lbs and my height is only 5'8" - for my height and with that kind of weight I'm really obese!  I tried the "Master clense" and other diet recipes, and I even watched Richard Simmons videos but they didn't helped me at all!<br>  <br>  I tried going to a gym with a strict diet once and within a week later, I stopped going to gym and started eating more than before.  It brought me back to where I started again.  I am sure you happen to experience it like me.<br>  <br>  One day, I was watching CNN news and they interviewed this hypotherapist guy, his name is Steve.  I myself do not believe in hypnotherapy but the hypnotherapist was rather convincing so I visited his site (<a href="http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterlivingwithhypnosis.tk/)</a> and he has a "Weight Loss Powerpack".  I bought the part 2 "Weight Loss Powerpack 2" which consist of Weight Loss, Stop Binge Eating and I Love To Exercise.  It is more affordable than a month of subscription to the gym and having those strict diets.<br>  <br>  The first few days I realized my eating dropped significantly and my weight dropped a little.  A week later, I begin to feel motivated to exercise and such!  His hypnotherapy works!  It has been a month already since I bought his program and I already lost 18.3 lbs!

AA11693263	Do you know what a UTI is? It stands for Urinary Tract Infection. Is is not transmitted sexually. It is from germs getting into then Urethra and then traveling to your Bladder. A females Urethra is very, very short and it is very easy to have germs introduced in to it. You boyfriend can't give you a UTI. In fact, because a male has a much, much longer Urethra (the tube that carries the urine from your bladder so that you can "pee" it out) it is very rare for men to even get them. You can't give him a UTI either. You can get them from the condoms that you have been using, from taking baths, not going to the bathroom right after intercourse and "flushing out" any germs that you could have from the condom, his hands not being clean and him touching you, etc. If you were prescribed an antibiotic take it as directed, refrain from intercourse until you are completely healed, and drink plenty of water and/or cranberry juice to help dilute and flush out any bacteria. You may want to talk to your doctor about Sexually Transmitted Diseases or even look it up on the internet to educate yourself better about what they are and aren't and how you can get them and how to protect yourself form getting them. It sounds as if you have gotten wrong information along the way and the best way to keep yourself safe is to get properly educated about it.|`|R1uFA7nKaa	Yes you can.  Air is getting pushed up inside which is why you are getting uti.   I heard it helps if you pee after sex it helps not sure if that is true though.  Make sure to drink cranberry juice or take cranberry pills to fight off the infection.|`|OleVPkJgaa	whenever you stick anything anywhere in your body, you are risking infection. don't get nervous, its not going to happen 100 percent. and even if it does, there are tons of treatments|`|i3pn4jNcaa	yes its from not going to the bathroom before / or after sex. if you have to or if your close to having to it will bring on a uti.|`|YVeZ8K6haa	It is caused from different things, not just sex. Google "causes of UTI" there is a lot of information|`|bvnSjdmeaa	pee before and after sex because if you do no they will keep coming back and get even more painful every time.  It will also start to effect your kidney and you will start to pee blood.  The you will be forced to take a pill after every time you have sex..I know i am 21 and i have to take one after every time i have sex|`|1KqknaUHaa	You can get a UTI from not even having sex, so yes.|`|DWrS7Eggaa	Yes, the best way to avoid getting a UTI is to urinate after sexual intercourse.|`|K1UicE7kaa	You have to understand that the distance from the opening of the urethra to the bladder is a short distance. Don't think the source of the bacteria can only be from the male... it can be from yourself. There basically is mechanical massage that occurs with intercourse that might increase the risk of getting a UTI (for you).<br>  <br>  You might try drinking a daily glass of cranberry juice.  You also might have to see a urologist for a more specific evaluation... maybe you have a chronic bacteria that is resistant to the antibiotic you have been taking and it just knocks it down enough to allow you to reinfect yourself with the situation mentioned previously.  A urine culture and sensitivity might be in order.  <br>  <br>  Some people have to take a specific low dose antibiotic prophalactically and modified as uniquely prescribed by a urologist.  There really is rationale that makes sense for what you are experiencing... but, you will be healthy and happier if you seek a urologist that can appreciate the frustration you are going through.  The condom idea is good in your case... till this all gets figured out.   Good Luck!
NwpZcT3Caa	Yes, of course you have.  You earned a Bachelor's Degree from a rather prestigious Large Public Research University.  Then, you landed a full time salaried job in upper management paying $45,000 a year, which isn't bad for a 23 y/o.  You then paid off your debt and then reversed it and saved 3 grand, and with these tough times people becoming homeless because of the economic downturn that is a good thing.  You said you live with your parents, and I doubt they'd kick you out if you get laid off.  Getting laid off may be the door opening to go to grad school, which may not be a bad idea.  Something like that - that just happens in life.  Try volunteering and decide what you like and what interests you and see if any credible colleges offer master's programs in a specialized field.  My brother-in-law did that and decided to become an attorney. I'm almost 40, and I make about $32,000 a year.  So yes, for being 23 and earning that hard deserved degree with decent grades and a respectable job right out of the gate paying you a solidly middle class salary and room for growth (while not at the moment with the economy and all...), you have done something.  So, cheer up and give yourself a pat on the back.  You're only 23.  You've got a long path ahead of you.  This is just the beginning.|`|YwYxff87aa	Omg! Yeah you've surely done something, you started your life, don't expect great accomplishments, your young!<br>  I know someone really close, 26 yr old, didnt even decide what he wants to study yet!<br>  What you do doesnt bring sadness or happiness. Its your thankfulness and gratitude that you feel. Work up your confidence!!!|`|jQxkBrkraa	Dude, you have SO much to be proud of.  You have a great education, have a job, and make a pretty pennie @ that.. what more do you want. As an assistant manager I hope your feelings don't cross over to your employees.

Marry me?|`|NJaBS4smaa	Well Craig, first thing I can say is, you're pretty lucky to be making $45k/year with a degree in history. Not bad pay for working at Target.<br>  <br>  I think you're right to feel dissatisfied with your life, especially since you're living with your parents still. I'd say, find a roommate, move out, get on your own, and move on with your life. These days, a BA is ok but it's not the best you can do. Go to school part time and work on your master's degree.<br>  <br>  Or, instead of going to school, do something that makes your life count. Find a way to invest in other people, teaching reading or serving in a homeless shelter. Coach Little League. Either way, you've got to get on your own, so do whatever it takes to move out from your parents' house. Even our daughter was on her own by the time she was 21.

I recommend using weight watchers, it really helps! I know so many people who have lost anywhere between 10 to 30 pounds. There are books that help you, which you can probably find in Borders or something. You have to really modify your portions too. No eating late at  night either. <br>  Also, may is 3 months away, which is 12 weeks. The healthy weight loss is 2-3 pounds a week, so it might take a little longer but you will be there by june! Good luck!

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	First - it sounds like you have a pinched nerve in your neck.  I know this b/c I have the same problem every night, too.  I am right handed and I have done so much with my left hand, the latest doc I'm seeing thought I was lying when I told him I was right handed - that how much strength I've lost in my right hand/arm.<br>  <br>  Lets get you to sleep tonight.  I would suggest a Tylenol PM, Advil PM or something with Benadryl in it that will knock you out a bit to get you to lay flat and keep you out.  If for some reason you are not comfortable with those meds, try some relaxation techniques or *giggle* masturbation - well, it will make you tired!<br>  <br>  Now, I would say it sounds like you need x-ray and MRI of your neck ASAP.  And as far as medication, your doc needs to at least give you a muscle relaxant to get you some sleep.  Be stern with your doc and tell him what you need.  Today's doctors are fearful of prescribing and fearful of ordering too many tests.  Please don't let these overrated balloon heads intimidate you.  Go get what you need!!  And those are the tests you need before you wake up one morning unable to get out of bed b/c your entire left side isn't working at all.  And since you are in pain throughout the day, don't be afraid to ask for pain medication.  If IBU800 is strong enough, then take that.  It is a wonderful anti-inflammatory.  If you need something stronger for the short term, ask for vicoden.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Feel better!!|`|AA11693263	First of all, try sleeping in a different position. If I sleep on my back both of my arms go completely numb. Did your doctor order any tests or MRI' or anything to find out what is going on? You might need a nerve conduction test to see if you are having issues with the nerves in you arm or your elbow or shoulder. A blocked or pinched nerve in any of these places could cause the symptoms you are having. Also, you need to let your doctor know that the pain is really bothering you and is keeping you from getting a proper night's sleep. My doctor is very compassionate about the chronic pain and insomnia that I have from a neurological condition. If he didn't help me like he did I would have gone to another doctor. There is no reason for you to suffer and your doctor should help you and try to figure out what is going on and possibly prescribe you some medication to relieve your pain and help you sleep. If you are not getting the proper care from him then it is your right to find a doctor who will help you.|`|WVN6SKJyaa	As a licensed massage therapist who specializes in deep tissue therapeutic work, I might suggest that you could have Thoracic Outlet Syndrome.  This is a fancy name for the nerves that run down the arm, being compressed somewhere along the way.  If the compression of these nerves is happening at the spine, a chiropractor might help.  Many times there are tight muscles pressing down on the brachial plexus (nerves).  The tight muscles might be the scalenes, pectoralis minor, etc..  A good knowledgeable deep tissue massage therapist should be able to help you.  Please consider a natural alternative before you start taking pharmaceuticals.|`|1O9jE4P2aa	your sleeping on a bad mattress or your sleeping...on yourself. sleepping on your side and on the arm could be pressing nerves and making you tingle. theres something your doing when your sleeping thats doing that. try sleeping on the couch tonight or another bed for a few days.|`|fZgoUty4aa	go to the Dr's or hospital why suffer .....

If you are a jr in college, I am assuming that you are only 20 years old or so... you have lots of time.  Look at the average age of applicants... it is usually like 24 or 25.  A lot of applicants end up going for their MS before applying (unless they are really top-of-the-class type students in undergrad).  If you don't want to go that route, work hard now in school... if you get a chance during the summer, or after graduation, retake some of your undergrad courses you didn't do so well in (get A's) to bring up your sciences GPA average... On top of everything else... crush your DAT's. (it also helps spending time shadowing dentists)

63bad0287364f42fcb1f15fc1fcea2a0aa	If his pacemaker stopped working properly his heart would beat to slow to pump enough blood to his brain and could cause the symptoms you described.  It is also a possibility that he has had a stroke or more likely a TIA or mini stroke.

There are many many other possibilities including low blood sugar or a need for a change in the medications he takes.<br>  <br>  It is understandable that you have many questions but, it is just too soon to have any real answers.

With the history you have given... there could be many many reasons for the symptoms he is having... some not so serious and will resolve... to somethings that could be very serious.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately... it is going to take a good 24 probably to get it all figured out and another 48 hrs more to effect the treatment and decide what the prognosis might be.  When patients are in his age range with the history you describe... it can be a real wait and see game.  The reason they are not saying anything to you is because they really don't know yet.  It is all speculation till the workup is completed and how he responds to the treatment being given now.<br>  <br>  They will be trying to make him as comfortable as they can tonite...

His brain (central nervous system) is affected. Head CT scan or Cranial MRI has to be taken to asses the damage.<br>  ISCHEMIC STROKE<br>  Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. Usually this type of stroke results from clogged arteries, a condition called atherosclerosis. Fat, cholesterol, and other substances collect on the wall of the arteries, forming a sticky substance called plaque. Over time, the plaque builds up. This often makes it hard for blood to flow properly, which can cause the blood to clot. There are two types of clots:<br>      * A clot that stays in place in the brain is called a cerebral thrombus.<br>      * A clot that breaks loose and moves through the blood to the brain is called a cerebral embolism.<br>  Other causes of ischemic stroke include:<br>      * Abnormal heart valve<br>      * Inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and heart valves ( endocarditis)<br>      * Mechanical heart valve<br>  A clot can form on a heart valve, break off, and travel to the brain. For this reason, those with mechanical or abnormal heart valves often must take blood thinners.<br>  HEMORRHAGIC STROKE<br>  A second major cause of stroke is bleeding in the brain. This is called a hemorrhagic stroke. It can occur when small blood vessels in the brain become weak and burst. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. The flow of blood that occurs after the blood vessel ruptures damages brain cells.<br>  Consult your doctor.

Ignore them.<br>  <br>  I am also a self-injurer. Well, former self-injurer. I no longer hurt myself reguarly, but I still slip up every once in a while, so I know where you are coming from. I know that SI feels good, that the release of chemicals in your brain helps calm you down. <br>  <br>  Why do you feel like cutting? Did something specifically trigger you, or is this just a random urge?<br>  <br>  I advise you to call someone you can trust, if you know any night owls. :) Someone you know can help you a lot more than strangers on the internet. Or call a suicide hotline. You don't have to be suicidal to call those people, you can only call them to vent if you need to. It's best to have someone right there with you to help you with a crisis.<br>  <br>  Try doing something to distract you. Take a really hot or really cold bath. Splash water on your face. Listen to loud music. Exersize. I know it's late at night, so not all of these may be possible, but do whatever you can. Something that'll shock your body the same way cutting does so you can get that endorphin release that you so crave, but in a safer way. <br>  <br>  In the long term, I really suggest you get medical help. Now, don't freak out, not all psychiatrists or therapists are like the ones in the movies. It may take a while to find a good one, but my psychiatrist and therapist are two of my favorite people in the world. If you have a mental illness and can afford it, I recommend seeing a psychiatrist rather than your regular doctor for diagnosis and medication, if needed. Not knocking your regular doctor, but they usually understand this stuff better. You can even look at some kind of rehab if you think that would be better for you. I am not implying that if you cut yourself, you automatically have a mental illness. You could be perfectly healthy otherwise. Still, there's a reason your cutting, and you need to work through whatever that is so you can get better. I know it seems unthinkable to ever give up cutting, but once you solve whatever that problem is, you won't need cutting so much anymore. Sure, you'll still crave it once in a while, but it will be easier.<br>  <br>  Check out my sources for additional help. I hope you'll be okay; I will pray for you.|`|XR4auwQ8aa	Try EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) instead, look it up on utube there are lots of examples of how to do it, you just tap certain areas of your body, it has been proved to help a great deal with Self Harm.

It speeds up your metabolism therefore helping you to lose more weight.  Weather you are starving yourself depends on how big a meal you are eating.  If you are only eating a small meal yea.

GXiCrhVYaa	Hi. In almost all cases, 10 mg is the maximum dosage for Ambien. I suggest not taking 15 mg unless your doctor says it is ok. Ambien occasionally has weird side effects. I got the following info from the internet.  <br>  <br>  Rarely, after taking this drug, people have gotten out of bed and driven vehicles while not fully awake ("sleep-driving"). People have also sleepwalked, prepared/eaten food, made phone calls, or had sex while not fully awake. Often, these people do not remember these events. <br>  <br>  One alternative is that you might sleep better with Ambien CR. It is time released and more likely to help you sleep through the night without waking up.<br>  <br>  Another alternative is to ask your doctor for Lunesta, which is similar to Ambien, but stays in your body longer. So you are likely to sleep longer and better.<br>  <br>  Although it is not a benzodiazepine, Ambien can become addictive. If you stop it, please taper off slowly.<br>  <br>  You might see if your doctor would prescribe Ativan or Xanax if you still have a problem. These are benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety meds) that do not stay in your body very long.|`|AA12048417	I'd be careful---benzodiazepines have a very high addiction potential.|`|AA11845254	I don't think your Dr would have a problem with that.He gives you what works. But you have to ask her.I take 10 mg and a Ibuprofen that seems to do the trick.<br>  Remember this tho.You take your pill in the kitchen and head straight for bed.Do not wait and you will sleep in 15 minutes.

Besides, Listeria is one of the few bacterium that can survive and MULTIPLY at refrigeration temperature (2-8C). So whether the food is at room temp or refrigeration wouldn't matter.

You would have to do exercises to work your abdominal area in addition to doing cardio exercise (running, swimming, etc.) You can have the best abs in the world but if they are covered by fat they won't show. If you keep up moderate exercise you won't "get fat."

aPClcfh9aa	I had a half leg cast, and I walked on it the whole six weeks and ended up needing surgery. You will lose some size but nothing noticible to anyone but you. if it is a traditional plaster cast make sure you have a metal coat hanger handy to scratch with, and don't be afraid to ask for it to be replaced at least twice before it comes off, they can get pretty gross. If you have a moon boot (like a giant combat boot) don't get to comfortable in it to the point you feel like you are ok to walk on it.<br>  <br>  Maybe cut back a little on food if you are worried about bulking up some with the lack of activity.

TjQAs0BKaa	I know how you feel about the best friend situation. My best friend and I were so close, inseperable. Then last year she went out with this guy for about 9 months who made her incredibly depressed. She ended up turning to drugs... and druggie friends. She went off to one of those schools that help out people who got into that situation, but then her family moved and I will probably never see her again. I miss her horribly, and I cry about losing her quite often. It's been over a year since she's been gone, and it's still hard. School is not the same. Life isn't, rather. But look around for some of the people you are only ok friends with. Yes, they may not be as popular, but I've found that the not as popular people tend to be nicer, and not as judgemental. Just find someone you can confide in, guy or girl. (Your crush may not be a good idea, you may not remain close for very long. The sympathy is nice for a while, but then people get fed up with it.) Btw... I'm one of those non popular girls, and I know my friends are true friends. I feel alone sometimes just because I do so many outside of school activities, and I do not have that much time for them, but I do my best to be there for them. People remember when you care about them, I know I do. As my dad told me recently, it's a give and take relationship. You give your help, your comfort, your advice. In return, you get good friends, and the same thing. <br>  <br>  About depression, I have a friend who was born with a severe depression problem. He is actually on medicine to make him happier- doctor's prescription. I would recommend seeing a school counselor. Yeah... they can suck sometimes, but even so, it's nice to just let everything out to someone who cannot tell anyone. Actually... the perfect person may be a Catholic priest. Even if you are atheist or another religion, most priests will welcome you. In Catholocism, there is something called confession, where you tell the priest everything you've done wrong, etc. You can murder someone, tell a priest, and they are not allowed to tell anyone. Ever. That's why it is one option, even if it sounds weird to you... the priest will never tell anyone because his job forbids it. <br>  <br>  Maybe tell an adult you like. Your parents or a relative, a neighbor, even a close teacher. They may be able to offer some advice... and some teachers become teachers so they can help people like us who need help. Some teachers do want to advise you, and then others.... well.... you know what I mean ;o)<br>  <br>  Maybe you are bisexual? It is a possibility. It may be hard to admit to yourself but it's completely ok. One thing that may help is joining a Gay Straight Allience club at your school. At my school everyone loves that club, and people feel very welcome. Another thing, theatre people tend to be a bit more open about stuff. The first time I met bisexual kids was in a theatre production in 8th grade. Theatre people may be a bit more dramatic (kind of a given =]) but they are willing to talk and listen to this. Theatre people tend to accept different sexualities much easier than many other social cliques around.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I always have done sports. It helps take my mind off things that I really do not want to think about. And if you do not like to act, you can always be stage crew =] My mom constantly goes on runs, and does not bring her ipod, just so she can think. That may help a little bit. Oh, and eat plenty of chocolate =]<br>  <br>  I don't have any hotlines you can call, but gooogle is always fabulous. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck, and even though you don't know me, you have a sophomore rooting for ya =]|`|gGxEzhbiaa	you might need counsiling|`|mDMnhqwdaa	I know exactly how you feel, but you have to keep trying..things ARE going to get better for you and you're going to get your life back.

You should really use a second form of birth control when your having sex, because regardless of how long you've been on the pill you can still get pregnant.  I've had sex with my boyfriend, whom I've been with for two years, without condoms and I've never been pregnant.  My mom got pregnant with me when she was on the pill and my older sister just gave birth to me nephew and yes you guessed it she was on Yasmin when she got pregnant.  My advice to you honey, be careful, become a mommy when your ready.  Accidents can be good to if your financially stable.|`|2kKrWmm8aa	I have been getting conflicting opinions on the same topic.  My doctor told me it would be okay to have unprotected sex right away.  A friend said her doctor recommended a month.  Some websites have said 1 or 2 weeks, and my pill info sheet said 1 week.  <br>  <br>  I think the main reason they say to use back-up is that if you need to stop taking the pill immediately because of side effects, you would be left unprotected and sperm can survive inside you for five days.<br>  <br>  You are probably fine, but in any case, the act has been done, and only time and a pregnancy test will tell. <br>  <br>  Good Luck

Note that girls get their first period from ages 8-16... You haven't turned 16 yet. If more than five or six months passes after you turn 16, I suggest that you talk to your doctor... but the sooner you talk to your doctor, the better.

OoftsMLhaa	Before shaving, gently scrub with a loofah or facial scrub lotion. This scrub helps remove dead skin and bring out ingrown hairs and reduces razor burn rashes.<br>  <br>  Shave after taking a shower or after washing in warm water. Warm water and steam help soften skin and hair. Wait about 20 minutes after getting up before shaving, as this will allow bodily fluids that have welled in your skin during the night to disperse. Also, it's a good idea to shave after exercising rather than before so that sweat doesn't irritate the freshly-shaved skin.<br>  <br>  Use new, sharp razor blades, and be sure to discard them before they become blunt. If using an electric shaver, be sure to clean the blades regularly and to keep them free of hairs. Wet the skin and lather the entire area to be shaved with a quality shaving cream or gel. Make sure you've let the cream or gel sit on the skin for a few minutes before shaving; this will increase the softness of the hair and will reduce the skin irritation. It's important to use a cream or gel specifically designed for shaving, as ordinary soap will dry out skin and increase the likelihood of irritation.<br>  <br>  Shave with the grain of the hair in short, deliberate strokes. Shaving against the grain increases the odds of ingrown hairs, irritation, and inflamed skin. Long strokes often cause one to press down too hard on the skin, increasing razor contact and making razor burn more likely.<br>  <br>  Rinse the blade after each stroke. If the razor is full of hairs, it won’t get a close shave, and irritation will be more likely.<br>  <br>  Rinse your blade under hot water before you begin to shave and after every few swipes. This removes the accumulated shaving cream, hairs, and skin particles. For a really close shave, remoisten the section you just shaved, by spreading a thin layer of lather from another area, and then swiping that area again. Keep everything moist. (Note: The use of hot water here is to help lubricate, has nothing to do with "killing bacteria.") Just don't burn yourself!<br>  <br>  Wash well in cold water after you've completed shaving to remove all traces of shaving cream or foam. This helps close pores and lessen skin irritation.<br>  <br>  Apply a moisturizer or aftershave lotion to help keep the skin soft and reduce the presence of razor burn. Various skin types respond differently to the plethora of gels, lotions, ointments, balms, and aftershave treatments available. Research the different aftershave applications to find the alternative that best matches your skin type. Aloe Vera with or without a moisturizer really seems to work well for many people.|`|M9tH99gfaa	try using an electric razor....it dosent get as close but it wont cause bumps...i had the same problem and i use one now and it works good....u could also try using depilatory creams (like nair and veet) but it culd be bad to use down there cuz of the chemicals in them....and there is always waxing. i culd never get it to look and feel good with regular shaving because the skin is so sensitive...but good luck|`|fT6x5YChaa	Shaving is not the best thing, try waxing.

Keep Eating!|`|kbGOMwi7aa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~<br>  <br>  Heres a chart to help you:<br>  <br>  (Average for teens)<br>  5'0" = 94.5lbs <br>  5'1" = 98lbs<br>  5'2" = 101lbs<br>  5'3" = 104.5lbs<br>  5'4" = 107.5lbs<br>  5'5" = 111lbs<br>  5'6" = 114.5lbs<br>  5'7" = 118lbs<br>  5'8" = 122lbs<br>  5'9" = 125lbs<br>  <br>  (Average for adult females 20+yrs)<br>  5'0" = 100lbs <br>  5'1" = 105lbs<br>  5'2" = 110lbs<br>  5'3" = 115lbs<br>  5'4" = 120lbs<br>  5'5" = 125lbs<br>  5'6" = 130lbs<br>  5'7" = 135lbs<br>  5'8" = 140lbs<br>  5'9" = 145lbs<br>  <br>  This is based on adult BMI charts for women<br>  Hope this helps~|`|dJuEtGxraa	After i answered j M's question, he starts taking credits for my answers and pasting it on another question.

D100ixUgaa	You're probably not eating enough, actually. A thousand calorie deficit is at the extreme end of the scale, and, since you're at a healthy weight, your metabolism has probably slowed down to maintain your existing fat. I'd up your average calories to at least 2,000, but spread them out like this (sorry if I'm telling you things you already know):<br>  <br>  -Eat six small meals a day. Eat constantly, basically. Your first meal and your last meal should be heavy on protein.<br>  -Save most of your carbs for after you weight train. Your pre-workout meal should have carbs, too. But your post-lifting workout can really be a pigout, because the hour or so after lifting is when your muscles are starving for energy and nutrients, and whatever you eat will be sucked right up into the muscle.<br>  -No carbs in the three hours before bed, ever, unless you just weight trained.<br>  -Fewer carbs on days you don't weight train.<br>  -Don't eat the same number of calories every day. Varying your calories in the 1800-2500 range will keep your body guessing.<br>  -Break your diet once a week. Eat whatever the heck you want. This will keep your metabolism going, and will release chemicals that actually help you lose weight.<br>  -Do high-intensity interval training for your cardio at least three days a week.<br>  -Make sure you're eating enough fat, otherwise your body will stop metabolizing fat. Stick with healthy fats. Put flax oil in your protein shakes, eat avocados, snack on almonds between meals, etc.<br>  -Drink tons of water.<br>  <br>  That should work, although, because everybody's body's different, you might have to tweak some things. But this is how I eat and it works for me, and based on what I've read on fitness blogs and forums, it seems to work for most active people. Since you are getting into the lower ranges of body fat percentage, though, you might also want to read some bodybuilding forums and see what bodybuilders do during their "cut" phase. I know some of them eat crazy low calories and still lose weight, but then, bodybuilders aren't always the best people to listen to when it comes to health & wellness.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if your lifting schedule doesn't involve heavy compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, pullups, and barbell rows, add them! Deadlifts, especially, will destroy you, and make your workouts a lot more intense and effective. Great for your thighs and butt, too.

SJx9IWWtaa	Try Slim Fast (or the cheaper store version, they have the same ingredients).    Slim fast has a lot of vitamins in it and its light on the stomach so it will help give you energy.  Just read the label.  <br>  <br>  Don't JUST use slim fast, eat food to.  But it makes a good breakfast (easy and fast), and a good snack..maybe before practice?  <br>  <br>  Your pretty active, so I wouldn't worry to much about adding a lot of protein in your diet.  Good luck!|`|q7kv0DbTaa	Transition lifestyle is the weight management program that helps people turn fat into muscle so as to increase metablism.  Muscle dictates metablism.  The more muscle you have the fast is your metablism.  It is called losing size instead of losing weight because one pound muscle is just half the size of one pound fat.  Low glycemic food is the key in this program.  Check out the glycemic index and eat the low index one, you can turn fat into muscle.|`|fqOncyLaaa	You need to have a look at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cefjtj" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cefjtj</a> this program encourages you to eat the right foods and it will show you exactly what to eat for your energy release throughout the day.

Do7UBU7Kaa	last year i was seriously exactly like you. im 16 now and my whole life i was just a little overweight. i would have a random day that i would run 3 miles and eat healthy and then 3 days later i'd be eating shitty again. i tried everything. and on top of that i played 3 sports, but the weight never came off. months would go by and i would always think that if i just stayed on the diet i would be skinny right now. i weighed 160 in winter of 08`. by the summer i  weighed 130 and i was never so confident in my entire life. i have become somewhat of a gym freak but i recently had a week off of school and i've been eating so bad, but i try not to punish myself for it. you shouldn't rule out all bad foods at first and exercise all crazy. you should ease both of them in. try taking away something like soda and replacing it with water. it saves a lot of calories. the reason i lost those thirty pounds because i couldn't take it anymore. i put models' pictures all over my room and i joined a gym. all it really takes is determination. you can definetly do it. once you lose a few pounds you'll be on a roll. and sometimes sneaking a brownie is good when you've been strict on your diet the whole week. it's a reward and all you should make yourself do is exercise for 10 more minutes the next day. this is probably things you've heard many times before. i would have thought the same thing. but you really can do it if you just set your mind to that 20 lb. goal.|`|fqOncyLaaa	Hi I lost 20 lbs in the last month.

What really woke me up was when i when to my doctor he told me i was over weight i could possibly have many problems from eating habits. The first step i took was eating healthier and i don't mean starving myself i kept eating what the secret is, is to actually eat food not like un healthy food but food if you eat food your body has energy to burn that off. i also hooked up with the local gym get a friend to work out with you i've been working out for about 1 1/2 years now and have pretty much kept the weight off but it will take time i still haven't completely lost all the weight i put on yes im still a little heavy buy i just keep working out. Gain muscle mass is a big help. For every pound of muscles you gain your body has to burn around 50 extra calories just to support that so if your were burning 1,000 calories just doing nothing then you'd burn 1,050 doing nothing! One thing i must warn you if you gain muscle mass don't do to much cardio, or even if you don't have muscle mass your body after a certain point will start taking protein from your muscles to get energy to do cardio so you don't really lose fat. I recommend 30 mins of cardio a day. Hope that helps you out some|`|SJx9IWWtaa	The only time I lost 20 lbs or more was when I was on atkins and exercising.  What worked for me was having a goal.

Base all of your foods/snacks around fruits/veggie. Following the pyramind with whole grains only, limit your processed food. Start cooking yourself.<br>  Also, exercise! What i recommend is get your running shoess out and start running. if you can't run at first, walk brisk with short burts of running-upping that running bursts each week. Until you're able to run 5 minutes straight, it get pretty easy from there. Also, run/walk up as many hills as you can!<br>  Also, do some type of stregnth training atleast 2-3 times a week. I do palates. I have an at home dvd: Hit The Spot Pilates with Denise Austin. I got it at wal-mart for 10$. <br>  Stick with this and trust me, you'll lose the weight!!

You have one body and one life. Make it your best!! :D<br>  I hope this helps!!<br>  GOOD LUCK! ??|`|lmHBKBxYaa	You need three things to lose weight.<br>  1: A reasonable diet. The reason really-low-calorie diets always fail is because it sucks being on them. So don't go on a diet. Change your eating patterns. If you want to lose weight and keep it off, you're going to have to eat less food than you do now, not for a month or for a year, but for the rest of your life.<br>  2: Willpower. Losing weight sucks. It's a lot of hard work and there's times that you'll hate yourself and just want to eat like a hundred cakes. Don't let yourself do that. More importantly, if you do fall off the trolley and you break your diet, get right back on. <br>  3: Hope. Losing weight takes a long time. Losing 20 pounds will take a minimum of 3 months, and that's if you work hard every day. It may take six months or a year. But as long as you stick with it you'll make it in the end.

Itchiness, burning, and extra "stuff" coming out are usually tell tale signs of a yeast infection. Or an STD, if you are sexually active. But let's not jump to conclusions.

Personally, I find the 7 day treatment works the best even though it is a pain in the rear to do it that long. If you try the Monistat treatment and you still have the same problem, or if it gets worse or painful, go to the Dr and make sure its nothing more serious.<br>  <br>  If it is a yeast infection, for future prevention, try staying away from excess sugar and yeast products...Candidas (yeast infection organism) thrive on sugar and yeast.

bjcjQ4zfaa	Your body burns calories for energy.<br>  <br>  There are three forms of a calorie:<br>  Fat<br>  Protein (muscle)<br>  Carbohydrate<br>  <br>  Your body will burn <br>  Carbs first (your food you just ate)<br>  <br>  Then after carbs are depleted it will breakdown unused Branched Chain Amino Acids (part of your muscle) into glucose (more carbs)<br>  <br>  Then it will go after fat stores.<br>  <br>  <br>  SO.<br>  <br>  This is why you hear of people running in the morning before breakfast on empty stomachs: Because they have no carbs in their system so their body burns fat.<br>  <br>  You want to do have very little to eat before you do cardio.<br>  <br>  The problem is if your body is past carbs it wants to eat your muscle too. So what you need to do is do some moderate to heavy muscle work - high intensity, but low volume (probably on alternate days or at a different time since you will be working on such low food intake) so your body is signaled that "Keep this muscle, we need it". This way muscle loss is minimal and fat loss is maximized.<br>  <br>  Don't do atkins, have good balanced meals throughout the day but cardio on a near-empty stomach.|`|wJGJUVswaa	atkins  no carbs lots of protien|`|227a46c59a45966193316044d4629a9eaa	Atkins is a fad diet that will eventually cause more problems then good. Our body goes into a fat storing mode when we dont eat. If you want your body to use stored body fat eat small healthy meals every three hours and stop 3 hours before bed time. This speeds up your metabolism, and your body stops storing fat. This is not a fad diet. This is the way we should eat any way.  If any one answers with a no carb, no sugar, no protien, only eat soup diet dont do it.

Have a look at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cefjtj" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cefjtj</a> they helped me lose weight fast and it was all down to the way they train your body.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you|`|AvY17Y8Taa	Exercise more and more often! (Everyday if you can)|`|bA9avi6Waa	increase your heartrate by doing exercise, it should be around 75% of your Max heartrate, then maintain this heartrate for 15-30min depending on your current health.<br>  <br>  a lot of websites give you a formula for Max heartrate to calculate fat burning zone, but my take is this: only you know your heart, anything beyond Max heartrate can be fatal
BJ0kC81saa	I got mine on today.<br>  They were approximately $5,350.<br>  Metal braces were $5,000.<br>  So ceramics were only $350 more.<br>  <br>  I live in Adelaide, so I doubt the prices would be much different in Brisbane.<br>  Also those prices are without health cover.
pqnEavSyaa	Yes, the foot arches do tend to weaken further with age if not supported correctly.  Flat feet (or low/fallen arches) can lead to over-pronation, a biomechanical imbalance that may cause serious problems over time.  When people who suffer from over-pronation stand or walk, the arches collapse with every step they take, and the ankles roll inwards.  Pronation itself is not wrong as we need to pronate and supinate as part of our gait. Pronation (rolling in) acts as a shock-absorbing process and supination (rolling out) helps to propel our feet forward.<br>  <br>  Flat feet or fallen arches often lead to uncomfortable, and even painful conditions such as plantar fasciitis and heel spurs. The most effective treatment solution for over-pronation is to wear an orthotic shoe insert.<br>  <br>  For more information please refer to links below.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	Probably.  I mean your body does get wear and tear over the years.<br>  <br>  I think I ended up with that ankle thing, were flat feet ends up making your angles dip in because you have nor arch.  I just know my feet get really sore after even just a little while :(
oqQjnpfGaa	Interesting. <br>  <br>  The most interesting thing about the whole deja vu part is that it totally feels real and it happens because the brain sometimes is in a different world when under the influence of 420. Don't trip or think too much about it, most people will just say to just relax, sit-back and once again don't worry about it... :)|`|SITdHSDkaa	nah it just relaxes your mind so you think about a lot of different things<br>  but your first time usually doesn't do a lot to people so keep doing it for a while and then come back with the crazy things you thought of haha|`|JiHuiBfSaa	idk ive never been high but thats not deja vu thats like flashbacks. i know people who have been high and none of them told me anything like that. i think different things could cause that cuz that actually happened to me today and i wasnt high
0ffa3071ec5d97e40f2988e5bf8d9e8faa	low on fluids, drink some gatorade|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	You are dehydrated, and if you have had a fever, you need to seriously re-hydrate yourself...check yourself for dehydration by pressing in the skin on your forehead with both of your thumbs,  if ithe skin stays depressed for a couple of seconds, or more, you are dehydrated...<br>  <br>  Drink fluids, but if you still have a fever or any vomiting, you need to be seen by a doctor tomorrow to make sure your electrolytes are not off kilter....<br>  <br>  Also, try stretching you legs a bit, because lying in bed and not moving around doesn't help either...this increases your risk of blood clots...
gnIEDg6maa	45 minutes?  Come on!  Anyway, are you taking any medication? Anti-depressants, allergy pills, etc.  They can cause a problem.   If you climaxed, you would know it.|`|xqtKODvbaa	I think the only medical condition you're suffering from is your imagination, 45 minutes? come on, who are you trying to fool?<br>  <br>  anyways, use a condom next time, and make an appointment at your local mental heath clinic.|`|yEDR0fnOaa	If you didn't feel it, you didn't ***.|`|vTqt8Js4aa	if u "exploded" inside of her then the *** will come out..which obviously means u did.|`|f51add1bb24dfaf25950116f2e2157cdaa	How old are you first of all. Second, were u having unprotected sex? If you were using a condom you would see your ejaculation in the condom. If not then the sperm would run out of your girlfiend's vagina in a few minutes. Most importantly, you would have felt it, trust me guys don't miss that, EVER. were u a virgin?|`|63bad0287364f42fcb1f15fc1fcea2a0aa	Wear protections and it is does not matter.  You can ejaculate sperm cells just from being aroused and not ejaculating.  You can get her pregnant without out climaxing.  Wear a rubber.|`|DAOqVfM5aa	If you didn't feel anything, then you didn't c*m. And you will know if you do, because c*mming hurts.|`|s6qgkfLxaa	congrats, you must be gay.|`|XXbZAriNaa	my knows when he c*ms
