1QSsOAAFaa	Walk her often if you're not. walking a dog solves so many behavior problems. it tires them out and they feel less bored (and so have less need to destroy). labs chew, though. that won't change. <br>  the best you can do is to give her other things to chew, like bones and toys. this mitigates but won't solve the problem.<br>  you can try spraying repellent on the outdoor stuff if you don't mind the smell, but that can be expensive too. some dogs hate vinegar or tabasco sauce, which you can sprinkle on what they chew.|`|FX8tFczfaa	whenever she bites or chews on something put her outside and say no. its like a timeout, she will soon understand its not right to bite on things. or i remember using a spray which has an awful taste for dogs, just go to the vet and ask for a spray. sorry dont remember the name :)|`|4fAikyfDaa	hi<br>  <br>  there are lots of tips help you how to train your dog to walk beside you<br>  <br>  check the following link<br>  <a href="http://dogtraining.6x.to/" rel="nofollow">http://dogtraining.6x.to/</a>|`|UhHdadxyaa	get  the dog drunk half the time some bud wil keep him light and slow,less aggresive -now that,s a keeper|`|UC9Wjjscaa	Walk, Walk, Walk, that is the answer to so many problems with dogs misbehaving.  She is undoubtedly bored out of her mind.  Could you imagine being locked in the same room all the time day in and day out.  She needs the exercise and stimulation only a walk can give her.  And with that breed she needs a pretty good walk not just up the road and back.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Do your parents not realise that they are responsible for the dog they brought into the home?  That means if the going gets a little tough you train the dog, you don't 'get rid of' it.  You get rid of garbage, not dogs.<br>  <br>  Is this dog an inside dog or does she spend her life outside in the yard?  <br>  If she is confined to the yard you need to construct a dog run with chain mesh fencing.  <br>  If she is an inside dog then you need to watch her more closely.<br>  She is very young and is obviously bored, that's why she's destructive. Most young dogs are.  You need to exercise her a lot more...every day.   A tired dog is a good dog.<br>  <br>  Take your dog to obedience training so you can learn how to teach her.

If someone can take care of 100  animals and give them a good life, go for it.|`|ab1735b1185c7e42bcba37deb9057a6aaa	Yes, absolutely there should be a limit, in my opinion.  6 is what I"d call the outside edge of appropriate.  That's about how far my patience and attention can stretch, anyway.   Any more than that and the pets would still get enough food and exercise, but things like petting and training and brushing would certainly suffer.|`|SRmNJCdiaa	If you have the money, resources and time to properly take care of a lot of animal I don't see anything wrong with it.  I think there are plenty of people who can take care of multiple animals.  If they are getting regular vet visits, good food, exercise.  Depending on the size of your townhouse it might be pushing it.<br>  <br>  But then again there are people that couldn't take care of a single animal even if they had the money and time for it.  Some people just can't handle it.|`|v811KD7raa	if you have enough space in your home for 6 and you have enough time to ensure all 6 are healthy then sure why not|`|9V89R22Paa	Definitely, everyone in the world SHOULD be helping the animals, but unfortunately there are stuck up ppl in the world who want nothing to do with them and don't stop for them in our streets. This is why there is an overflow of animals in this world without good habitats.<br>  <br>  But I mean you wouldn't want to be faced with some animal neglect charges, and a lot of that type of stuff goes unnoticed, so you may not know if you are being neglectful when you really could be. <br>  <br>  Be careful and make sure they all have plenty of individual space for themselves. Many people who have lots of animals have what one would call an pet "sanctuary" in countryside areas. Plenty of back yard space. Don't take on more than you think you can handle.|`|AA10206525	I think it all depends on how much time you can give to them and whether you have the passion to look after them,I personally have 6...and I still want more to look after and they all receive equal attention and are very happy but some people get pets just because they "looked cute" at the shops or the animal seemed very interesting so it all depends on the person,not on the amount of pets|`|KfzuzB47aa	I dont think there is a specific limit i think they can have as many animals as they want as long as the animals smell good and look healthy, and have a good home that is clean smells good and is sanitized. also i think the love you give them should be spread evenly and one shouldnt get any less than the other. to me its about having the best for them so as long as you feel they have the best home and they are happy and taken care of it seems there is no limit...mine is 3 to 4 animals|`|ajSQYvINaa	no there's not as long as you can attend to them and their needs and have control over them. also you only own cats and dogs, no harm in that at all. but if you did own other wild animals, then yeah maybe you do need a limit for wild animals|`|1QSsOAAFaa	it probably depends on your income and opinion of the condition of their lives. really subjective thing. there are limits defined by animal control / humane societies, but those are pretty extreme.<br>  the octomom comes to mind....|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Really I think its an individual thing. For some people I know 1 animal is way too much and they can't handle it. <br>  <br>  Currently in my care I have 27 animals in my care. Dogs, cats, turtle, and 8 mice. Its manageable. I've had up to 55 in my care which was my limit in the current property.

I got my dog by myself when I was 17.<br>  <br>  From a shelter you usually have to be 21. Call and ask first. But if you don't have enough money for vet care don't you think it would be a good idea to wait until you are a little older so you can get a job?

I have to go to online school because people won't let me have a dog in the dorm.|`|yEnWdKfqaa	No most places would not adopt out to anyone under the age of 18. The way you would be able to get a dog at such a young age is by adopting from a private owner. You can look under the pet section at www.craigslist.com. There are a lot of people there giving away animals. You would just have to find the right person who would be willing to give their animal to someone your age. <br>  <br>  I hope you make sure that your mum allows this animal in her house first. The worst thing you can do is get an animal and then have to get rid of right away. It wouldn't be good for you or the animal.|`|jxbNUjuWaa	You can buy the dog yourself yeah.. but then you have to microchip him/her and sign papers,you have to be 18 years old for that.|`|DEPIyd6Paa	Is the dog male or female?<br>  <br>  It is not recommended to keep two of the same sex together (female/female, etc) because it is known that they are less likely to get along. And you wouldn't want to get a partner for lulu who causes her distress.<br>  <br>  Secondly if it is a male/female partnership, you will have to ensure that at least one (preferably) both are spayed/neutered as part of responsible ownership. <br>  <br>  Lastly, if your mother said no. She means no. It would be incredibly disrespectful and rude to bring home another pet when it has been expressly forbidden. She said no and that is where it ends. I'm sure she has her reasons.|`|oj3Jk59Uaa	i think pretty much any age but i think you have to be over a certain age to buy one from a shelter or pound.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Nope - sorry, anyone who would "sell" a dog to someone your age is not a responsible person. You need to be legally able to sign a contract (18 in most places, 21 in others) in order to take on full responsibility of a dog.<br>  <br>  Plus, you're still living in MOM'S house. She works to pay those bills (a good $2,000/month or more) and she has final say on what you bring in. Much like an apartment! She's the landlord and she says NO.<br>  <br>  Where did you get enough money for a dog, it's supplies, it's first vet check, it's monthly fees, AND enough for emergency fees?!

2Zb0eNfeaa	You could consider anbleps (four-eyed fish) or halfbeaks. There are also lots of killifish that would fit the bill. Check out the links below.|`|oMmBhWK4aa	Unusual fish are unusual or uncommon for a reason, mainly due to their specific requirements. So do your research & think very hard before getting any. They are certainly not fish for beginners.<br>  <br>  Some examples:<br>  - Butterfly fish<br>  - Archer fish<br>  - Glass catfish<br>  - Leaf fish<br>  - lesser spiny eel<br>  - ropefish|`|cfPz3sxGaa	hey maybe you could buy fish like the fish types from finding nemo!<br>  <br>  i once knew someone who had all the types of fish that were characters in finding nemo.<br>  <br>  it looked pretty kwl|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	What else is in the tank? The trouble with "unusual" fish is they often are not suitable for community tanks as they are either predatory or have appendages like long fins that leave them vulnerable to fin nippers, i.e. African Butterflyfish - long fins that get nipped and a huge mouth that swallows tankmates.
65b1MbtNaa	They've found that dogs wag their tails harder in one direction than the other, that the arc of the tail goes heavier to one side.<br>  <br>  There were some studies done.<br>  ----------------------- <br>  Is Your Dog Left-Handed or Right-Handed?<br>  Posted Sep 03, 2006 <br>  <br>  Australian scientists discovered that some dogs are left-handed, some are right-handed and the rest are ambidextrous. Though it may sound trivial, this piece of info comes handy when training dogs for police work or as guide for the blind. <br>  <br>  According to the study, canines who use both left and right paws equally (known as laterality) are more likely to be upset by fireworks and thunderstorms. These makes them unsuitable as working dogs. By determining this preference, trainers will be able to weed out dogs most likely to flunk even before the training starts. <br>  <br>  "Half the dogs that are selected for guide dog training don't make it and we're trying to reduce that failure rate because it is far from cheap," Paul McGreevy, an animal behavior expert at University of Sydney's Faculty of Veterinary Science. <br>  <br>  To determine if a dog is right-handed, left-handed or exhibits laterality, observe them when they try to steady their food containers. Not that it matters to you. We're pretty sure that, as far as your concerned, your dog is the best dog in the world.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	Not that I have been aware of. <br>  <br>  But dogs can be "handed". It is noticeable in some dog sports. In herding, many inexperienced dogs will want to "circle" the sheep in their preferred direction.

Regardless of what people think, hamsters have rather rough and tough little pads on their paws.  Also, you can place a terra cotta saucer under the water bottle, so they must walk on that to get water from the bottle. This also helps wear down the nails.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	i have some sand paper in my hamster's cage, its the type you put in a birds cage. its not too rough and it does NOT cut his feet up. hes had it in for 2 weeks|`|L75kWYehaa	Definitely no sand paper.

That helped my male dog a lot.<br>  Anyways always have clean, fresh, cold water available to a dog.  At all times.  Their water intake should be unlimited.

Never restrict your dog's water intake!|`|2gb6zN1raa	HI,<br>  <br>  Never restrict your dogs water intake - it is not like resource control/food control during training.<br>  <br>  If your dog is still peeing after a walk - it does not sound to me like its 'becasue he drinks alot'.<br>  <br>  It sounds like he is either stressed, or territory marking.  Pay careful attention to the relationship between him and the cat, him and guests, and also make sure you are a kind, assertive and calm leader for him - if any of these is causing him to mark territory or be nerovus, stressed, frustrated it can often show in persistant peeing.<br>  <br>  See if you notice WHERE he goes - is it the same spot or all over? ..buy some ￡1.99 or $4.00 citrella pet deterrant and clean up the old wee thoroughly with soda chrystals or antibacterial spray so he does not repeat the wee over the same place.  <br>  <br>  Also- does he just squat and go or is it whilst running / exicted as he may have a weak bladder problem - in which case you need to see the vet imediately for advice or antibiotics if its a water infection.|`|S6ie5HwBaa	Never restrict a dog water intact!

It is extremely dangerous, and cruel, to withhold water without good reason (ie before surgery and sometimes for training purposes, overnight).  If your dog is peeing excessively, it needs checking by a vet.  Take a sample of his urine with you.<br>  <br>  If you can eliminate any medical reason for this behaviour, you then get down to training/retraining.  Is this dog castrated?  If not, it is possible he's marking.  Castration may, but not guaranteed, help to stop this.  I'd suggest you use the crate method.  After coming home, crate him.  Keep him there for 20 minutes and then let him out, and take him outside to pee.  Go with him to see what's going on (incidentally is his 'flow' good - if he's just dribbling, he could well be starting bladder stones which, if left untreated, can cause a blockage and this is, obviously, serious, and life-threatening).  If he goes, bring him back in, loads of praise.  If he pees again inside (immediately) again crate him.  And so on until he gets the message that inside is not the place to pee, but outside is.<br>  <br>  Add - ditch the training pads!!  Counterproductive.  This dog needs to learn to do his business OUTSIDE.  Using training pads, beyond, perhaps, the first week or so (and depending on your accommodation - ie apartment?) is a waste of time, and money!  You only end up having to train twice, once to use the pads, and again to GO OUTSIDE.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	His water bowl should be full of fresh clean water at all times.<br>  <br>  If he is peeing in the house then you need to house train him, not restrict his drinking water.<br>  Start house training him by taking him outside every hour.  That way he will learn he is expected to go outside to pee not use the house as a potty area.

pl4UISsFaa	tommytrimble89, I can see you never had to deal with the problem.<br>  <br>  For one pigeons are very noisy especially in the early hours.<br>  Second they are not the cleanest neighbour to have unless you like having a house that looks like someone is throwing raw eggs at it on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  As for the harsha's question our neighbour had the same problem, he solved it by blocking the entrance of the nest when it was empty. That was in 1999 and to date the problem is solved.<br>  <br>  All the best, I know we have not complained since.|`|cWuumdy7aa	You may not like the idea of shooting animals, but if you're serious about getting rid of pigeons, you should consider it. The lack of fear pigeons seem to exhibit around humans makes them easy targets, requiring little more than a small gauge rifle like a .22 caliber. Since pigeons are an invasive species of bird, and are considered pests in many states, laws usually do not restrict the extermination of pigeons. However, you may want to consult your local law enforcement center for information about firearms laws in your township or district. The direct control of pigeons with guns is particularly effective in rural areas where pigeon populations are lowest.<br>    <br>  Using live traps to get rid of pigeons is possible, and seems to be the most effective form of population control in urban areas. Pigeon motels, as they are called, are relatively cheap considering some of your other pigeon control options. Bait a particular area for a few days to get the pigeons used to feeding there. Then, put the pigeon trap down, leaving the doors open, so that the pigeons learn to walk in an out of the trap. After that, you may begin to set the trap doors to close, leaving some pigeons in the trap to help attract more pigeons. Make sure to leave some water for the birds you intend to leave in the trap. Where you relocate the birds or what you do to them after that is none of my business.  <br>  Bird netting or stainless steel wire mesh fencing can be used to get rid of pigeons by excluding them from their typical roosting sites. I'll be honest with you, this isn't the cheapest way to get rid of pigeons, but it is one of the most effective deterrents available. If pigeons cannot roost nearby your property, they are likely to move on, and establish a larger community elsewhere. Wire mesh, screening, or bird netting may be hung under eves, in lofts, and anywhere else pigeons have been known to roost.<br>    <br>  Bird strips, as they've been aptly named, are another good way to get rid of pigeons by reducing roosting sites. Bird strips are those metal spikes or wires you've seen on large institutions, where large colonies of pigeons tend to roost. In an effort to reduce pigeon populations at my alma mater, pigeon deterring bird strips proved quite effective, making the local pigeon population relocate and disappear within a matter of months. Don't discount bird strips, or bird spikes as they're sometimes called, for repelling pigeons just because of the price. You may save money in the long run by preventing physical damages incurred by pigeon droppings.<br>    <br>  Bird scarers or bird alarms are another way to get rid of pigeons, but their effectiveness is questionable. The kind of bird alarm sold by companies like Martley may employ both an audible alarm and a visual deterrent, but I've seen pigeons not move so much as an inch while someone was trying to shoot them with a rifle. So, the effectiveness of audible bird alarms and visual deterrents is left to the anecdotal evidence given by people who have used such bird control devices. I can't recommend these in light of the effectiveness of the four more direct pigeon control strategies outlined above.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Firearms are against the law for killing animals so are all BB guns according to the DEC and you can and will be fined for this. If the problem is that bad hang some plain cheap tin pie pans from string which will deter them or get a plastic owl or a motion detector owl that you can put out or hang. That is the most humane and pleasant way to stop this. BB's also contain lead and when birds of prey or cats eat the carcass of the birds you kill they can be infected with lead and zinc toxins. You can also not shoot or fire a BB guns within so many feet of housing. Good luck|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Pigeons, as a species, like the rat (to which they've been compared), have adapted quite well to urban environments.On Verminaters   They cleared out a church of the featherd rats.  One solution was to put down a shock system, like an electric fence.  It worked on a batter that was solar charged, and had 2 tracks on the border that they put down.  When they landed on the strip, they got a subtle little jolt.  <br>  Cat? Alka-seltzer? Shotgun?  Contact cement on the railing?  contact paper sticky on both sides? And there is of course, always the Tom Lehrer approach ( which I dont recommend) <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhuMLpdnOjY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhuMLpdnO...</a><br>  You probably just want them to go away rather than die, though, huh? <br>  (I got nothing, short of making someone else's balcony more attractive by putting good pigeon food on it.)|`|nvNDGP66aa	Pigeons are like fat rats with wings. If you are really disturbed by them,shoot them. Even if you shoot them with an air gun(in the head),they will die with a single shot. Otherwise you may try to give them poisoned food.|`|DvjbTNXvaa	PLEASE DON'T KILL THEM!!!!!<br>  they have complete rights to live!<br>  if u want to get rid of them then just drive them away with a stick.<br>  shooting is really mean and cruel!<br>  DON'T POISON THEM EITHER!<br>  try having a cat or a bird alaram|`|FOgyHNM5aa	How is it a menace? whats it doing? You need to realize that other animals live on earth too, you are not the only one and you shouldn't expect to have everything your way! That's kinda selfish!

8d25j8CYaa	When you are mounting make sure your horse's head is pointed toward you.  If you are using a western saddle, grab the horn with one hand and the cantle with the other. Jerk the saddle sideways, back and forth, until your horse plants her feet to balance. when all 4 feet are firmly on the ground, and you have the reins in your hand with her head pointed toward you, mount. If she wants to move make her move in a circle. Keep her moving until she stops. This kind of behavior can be dangerous. Old time cowboys used to put their foot backwards in the stirrup and swing their leg over the horse when it started to move.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Try getting on with her in a corner so she can't move.  Another thing to do is once you get on, halt her and have her stand by the block for a minute or two until she understands that she's not allowed to leave the block.|`|WxACyBbgaa	you need some one to hold the horse, my horse  hasn`t been messed with in years so if she thinks she is going to be rode you can count on it being along time before you can catch her she does not like being rode.But that`s going to change trust me,now that I`m the owner.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	This is what i do, when my horse wants to move like that i practice standing on the mounting block i will put my foot in the stirrup if my horse move i get out back them up(horse will get sick of standing out there just being backed up but they will learn what they need to do, you have to be firm<br>   not mean but let them know that you are the boss and you are bigger) it really works also when you do get on do not let your horse leave the block with out you telling them to do so!|`|phiJXEebaa	you might not realise it, but you could be giving her a gesture to move, like tapping her on, or there is something jabbing her. or she just never learnt to stand<br>  use treats when she does stand and teach her. <br>  <br>  x|`|U2YK6lcJaa	Try using the war bridal|`|kmGvPYLRaa	it may be because your horse doesnt like it when you are not in her full vision so is moving around to face you. if so you should tie her up and just walk around her, pat her and make a fuss of certain parts of her that she cant see you until she starts to stand still. then saddle up, then slowlt build up to a mount. <br>  <br>  you could get someone to hold her but that is just covering the situation not fixing it and sometimes there is no one else around and you need to mount but your horse wont stand still - then your stuck =(|`|QPMaoaSIaa	This is something you can't do on your own.<br>  You need someone to hold the horse and you need to get on with a mounting block.<br>  Once he becomes good at standing still with someone there, try mounting on your own.

1omgPICKaa	1. Heck yes! :D They can do everything a dog can do and more! You can train them (including toilet training), teach them tricks (including fetch), they are very animated and fun to watch, very playful, many species are cuddly... They can also be taught to talk and I'm not just talking about mimicing: it is possible to teach birds to speak in context and associate words with objects, sounds, desires, etc. Plus they live for a long time.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, they are very messy and many species are quite noisy.<br>  <br>  2. Very much so. As long as you give them the daily out of cage attention they need, parrots become very bonded to their owner. So bonded infact, that they may attack any other person that comes near you! To avoid this, always keep your bird well socialised by encouraging other people to interact with it (including strangers) and take it with you on walks by putting a harness on it.<br>  <br>  Birds can be very affectionate and loving. Mine would be very cuddly and give me kisses when I was sad.<br>  <br>  3. This entirely depends on what suits you. There are so many types of birds. Most people go for parrots (parrots include parakeets to macaws). Consider the following criteria:<br>  <br>  * How experienced are you with birds? If you want a parrot that's not for beginners, you will need to take your research very seriously and interact with the species you are interested in as much as you can before buying one. Be aware of the cons.<br>  <br>  * Parrots come in different noise levels. What noise level can you and your family handle?<br>  <br>  * How important is talking ability to you? What about trainability? Do you want a playful, energetic parrot? A laid back parrot? A cuddly parrot? An intelligent parrot?<br>  <br>  * Parrots range in size from the small budgies and parrotlets to the large macaws. What size parrot interests you and do you have the room for it?<br>  <br>  Me personally, I'm a lorikeet nut. I love how playful and silly they are, the way they exaggerate all their movements when excited. They love to lie on their back and wrestle your hands or play with a ball. They do have special diet needs.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, make sure you do lots of research first. They need a very large cage, a varied diet (all seed diet will kill them early), lots of toys, and they need time out of their cage to spend time with you everyday.<br>  Also learn about how to not accidently encourage behaviour problems, such as screaming and biting.<br>  <br>  Birds, in my humble opinion, are the most wonderful pet you can have. :)|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	1) Yes, in my opinion they do.  Some better than others but if you do everything right they will give you all their love.<br>  2) Yep, but you have to hand tame them and work with them to earn your trust. (I even got a dimond dove to bond with me...a major bond... and most people would argue that you can't bond with that type of bird.)   Once you do this they will roll over on their backs (depending on the breed) and take a nap right next to you. Just don't roll over!! lol  <br>  3) This depends on you and your schedule, how old you are, and how much money you are willing to spend.  I have a cockatiel and a parakeet. My tiel LOVES life, I will walk up to my door and if he sees me he will start singing me a song and once he sees me he will say "hello hello hello" with a big smile. He has personality and is SMART.   But birds are like humans, some are smarter than others but I've seen more smart than not.  My parakeet learns from my tiel so that's funny...he is a ball of energy and picks up on things fast.  If you have the money and are willing to read up a lot about a bird (which you should do anyways) check out this bird <a href="http://parrotcentral.net/caiques.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parrotcentral.net/caiques.htm</a>  I want this to be my next bird for many reasons. ANYWAYS! A best pet bird is up to you. That site also has other types of birds you can look at just go to home and click on the name of the bird.  Hope this helps!|`|3IXDx9nhaa	Yes they are good pets and they are very social so will bond with you.  Budgies (Budgerigars) or Cockateils are good, intelligent small parrots that make great pets as long as you give them plenty of attention and time out of the cage.  These websites will help with more info.  birds.about.com/od/breedsofbirds/a/choos... cockatielcottage.net, petaquarium.com.au, burkesbackyard.com.au/factsheets/birds/c... burkesbackyard.com.au/factsheets/birds/b...|`|nvNDGP66aa	it all depends on the type of the bird.|`|wSAIf49Waa	1. It depends on the type of bird and on what you want out of a pet. They make a good pet if you do not mind that they are noisy. If you want to be able to hold it, you'll also have to be willing to keep their wings trimmed. I had some cockatiels and thought they made great pets.<br>  <br>  2. Again, it depends on the type. Finches and parakeets do not bond with the owner. Cockatiels, cockatoos, and parrots do. The females tend to be friendlier and bond more than the males (males are usually too territorial). <br>  <br>  3. Cockatiels because they will bond with you, they are not as expensive as the large parrots like Macaws and African Greys, the yellow feathers that stick up on their head are cute, their beaks aren't frightening like the giant beaks on bigger birds, they can learn songs, and they have the potential to speak/mimic (takes more patience to train them than parrots though).<br>  <br>  My cockatiel loved to have its neck massaged and loved to stay on my shoulder. They really do make good pets :).|`|AA10206525	All of these questions depend on the person,some people might not like birds and how they behave because most birds have very human tendencies and have lots of emotional needs and they do bond with their owners,but not as easily as...dogs for example,but easier than cats,In my opinion the best bird to get is an African Grey because of their intelligence and they learn very fast and if you have one in the house you never feel lonely due to their constant jabbering 8-D|`|1gDTiPVyaa	1. They can be wonderful, charming little companions. They can be a lot of work, too. They can be noisy and messy. Like any other pet they get sick sometimes and have to go to the vet. Unlike other pets, it can be hard to find a vet who can help a bird. Not all vets are certified avian (bird) vets--they can be very hard to find. If you spend time with your bird, talk to it, they can be amazing. I had a parakeet who would pull my glasses off and fling them across the room. He sang every morning and most of the day.  My cockatiel has been keeping me company while I'm stuck at home with a broken leg. I'd be bored out of my mind without her.<br>  <br>  2. Yes, even parakeets will bond with their owner if you put time and effort into training and taming. It's all a matter of doing some research and putting in time. You can have a lonely, bored little bird that sits in a cage in the corner of the room and does nothing or you can have a lively, friendly little companion who adores you and wants to be wherever you are, but getting there takes work and it doesn't happen overnight. <br>  <br>  3. I like parakeets and cockatiels. Both are small and not horribly noisy. Parakeets have sweet little voices and if you have a couple, they'll keep up a running chatter most of the day--it's a pleasant sound. Cockatiels can be loud, especially if they're wanting your attention, but they can be really sweet. They bond to their "flock" very closely and they can be quite demanding.<br>  <br>  What you need to know is that in some ways pet birds are not like any other pet. They are highly intelligent creatures, accustomed to living in large "flocks" and although captive bred birds may have never lived that way, their brains are still wired for it. They need socialization. When you adopt one as a pet, you become their flock. They may bond with you quickly or it may take a while, but what it means is that when you have to be away for a while, a bird will feel abandoned. My cockatiel freaks out a little if I come home too late in the day. I won't leave town unless I have someone she trusts who can take care of her while I'm gone. A normal "pet sitter" won't really work. Birds can die of loneliness or feeling abandoned, so it's really important to have a plan for when you have to leave town. Putting down extra food and water and having a neighbor check on them once a day like you would for a dog or cat isn't really enough for a bird. <br>  <br>  Not trying to turn you off the idea, just trying to make sure you know. You probably need to do a lot more research before you make up your mind on this.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lNfv18Bsaa	Yes they are good pets to have.<br>  <br>  They will bond with you (at least chickens do anyway) especially if they get to associate you with food.<br>  <br>  I don't really know about that many birds, but chickens are good, they are cute, funny, and you get eggs from them.

Rabbits do that when their content. Or he could be playing and that's him form of excercise. Why not by him a run or let him out in the house if it's rabbit proof. (Make sure dogs are out of the way, wires lifted or covered up and there is nothing he could chew or choke on.)|`|FQmZLqMdaa	It is a sign of relaxation.

4aAhEK9daa	It's called an "Elizabethan Collar" as it resembles somewhat, the collars that god-knows-why were fashionable in the Elizabethan era.

7j4IJi1Qaa	Well if the area is fairly big.  As you stated.  They have each other.  And they still get to go on walks.  They have food, water, and toys.  And you pay attention to them once in a while.  And they get to be out of that area once in a while.  I don't think it's cruel.  As long as it's only for a couple of weeks.  It isn't too horrible!  Your fine!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|EcAeLWLFaa	i really don't think its cruel. do u want them to always use a littler box? how about dog pads? i have 3 dogs and my only girl uses the pads instead of going outside. once she learned she did very well and has only had a couple accidents. if u do want them to go outside then you'll have to take them out at least every 3 hours to let them know they go bathroom outside only. good job.|`|jcX7g2Mcaa	no, its fine. if they are barking alot and they dont outside the area, then think of what has changed and fix it, so it works inside the gated area too. its a good idea. dont worry. just figure out whats wrong, if anything. what you're doing is perfectly reasonable.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	No I wouldn't say it's cruel. You're trying to litter train them tho? Litter boxes are for cats, not dogs! You'll have more luck if you use puppy training 'pads'.<br>  <br>  One thing I will say - it's a common misconception that small breeds don't require as much exercise! They have as much energy, if not more than medium/large breed dogs. It's actually large breed dogs that should have restricted exercise while growing as their bones are growing at such an enormous rate, excess exercise can cause more problems.<br>  <br>  I would just say, give them as long a walk as they like - tire them out!<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|8KMukLkxaa	That sound's fairly reasonable. I know a man who keeps his two dogs outside in a shed with a bit of a caged area. The RSPCA have said it's ok for him to do that as they get exercise when he gets home from work. So apparently, no. It's not cruel.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	I don't think it is cruel, but I do think it could possibly lead to some problems because if they are locked in there most of the day they are missing some crucial socialization that they need at this age.  They do need constant supervision at this stage so I understand your dilemma.  Also without being out they will not learn that barking like that is not acceptable.  But if you are only going to do this a week or two it will probably not affect them much.  Good luck.|`|ApSzd48oaa	no it is not cruel if they are get attention then and love and everything else they need its fine
OyNJTWaiaa	At least 3m by 3 or 4m and I would make the height around 8 feet or 2 and a half metres tall. <br>  NO other birds in with them.<br>  <br>  *** A pair of macaws would certainly need more than that size aviary unless it was a macaw who had freedom in a house. <br>  Reason for space for your galahs ? Birds need to be able to fly, not just perch hop. Breeding birds breed best when happy and when they have good space and excellent food.
koXcq0l1aa	I think that they are more allergy prone when they're so small.  We adopted an 8 week old kitten about a year ago and she sneezed and coughed a lot and her eyes were runny.  You'll find that this quickly subsides.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I would have a vet take a look.  That's not normal to keep sneezing.  She could have a chronic upper respiratory infection.  Does mom have any sneezing or eye problems?|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	She's probably ok.  As long as she's acting fine.  It's probably just allergies.  But if your really concerned you can call your Vet and ask.  <br>  <br>  Now to Petinformation:  I doubt it's Cat Flu.  The kitten is acting fine and eating.  And the symptoms of Cat Flu are lethargic and not eating. <br>  <br>  And also don't feed your Cats Royal Canin.  That's a low quality cat food.  <br>  Go for something like Wellness or Innova a High quality food.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  And I think your kitten is fine.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	Could be allergies, could be dust in the environment, could be feline flu, could be a cold.....  I'd let a vet check her out.  You can give a little bit of plain yogurt to help boost their immune system, or get something called bene-bac from the pet store to do that (follow the instructions on the packaging).  But you really need to have the vet make sure it's not feline flu, which is very common in kittens and can be fatal.... you may end up having to do droppers of meds for a while.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CKxYgkrpaa	take her to the vet she may have a upper resipotary infec|`|S6ie5HwBaa	Take her to the vets,she somehow may have picked up cat flu-very serious in  5week old kitten and can be fatal in  such a young animal.

It is a common disease in cats and although not usually fatal in previously healthy adult cats it can be fatal in kittens and immuno-suppressed older cats<br>  <br>  It can be a stress that causes the flu in cats.<br>  Most likely your mother cat had the flu at one stage & the stress has brought it on to the kitten.

54GBWTgoaa	Not a husky unless your prepared to get two! my girl got so lonely she would howl and shred the house!<br>  their stubborn, and please don't just go on looks and their breed description... because they seem to have left out the part that they are just DON'T listen sometimes, their terrible of lead, they have a strong pray drive, they will happily ignore you for a cat or a squirrel, they are pack dogs >> if your not tough enough they WILL assume the position, their escape artists.... you may think the collar is tight enough however your husky thinks it's a piece of cake to slip, their food thieves, can never be left unattended in your back yard for the following:<br>  -they dig<br>  -they eat plants >> the good and dangerous ones<br>  -they chew fences<br>  -they can jump a 6ft fence if they smell another dog on the other side<br>  <br>  A lot of people nowadays are seeing snow dogs and snow buddies and thinking "omg i must get a husky!!" << like you said you would like a "handsome dog"<br>  - the blue eyes<br>  -the fluffy coats<br>  and <br>  -keen, cute expression <<< YES they are beautiful dogs and i have a female and she is a lovely dog and will always be my best bud << HOWEVER she's a real pain in the butt, and i would never go back on my decision but im not getting another husky for a while lol, we have her brother but he's not my dog so i don't have all the responsibilty, they keep each other company but at the same time we also have to seperate them alot >> so the sleep seperate, walk seperate and only really spend 30-40% of the day togther, their 9months and otherwise they would make their own pack>> bond less with us and not listen to us so it's tough, right now im going through the stage where you'll see a lot of sibes in shelters, the 6 - 18months stages >> i.e. the teenage months ;) >> our girl started doing training sessions once a week and she has been doing so since 3 months and boy does she need it >> she is sooooo stubborn and think's she's knows best, gets bored really quickly, you'll find you'll spend a small fortune of toys and treats for your sibe.<br>  <br>  some people just dont get them at all, they get a fluffy, blue eyed beauty and use the motto 'let him be a puppy' >> then they realise at around 8-18months that they have a huge problem on their hands >> a huge sibe that pulls, steals, jumps up, has no manners for you or guests, digs, and still chews your house to shreds.<br>  <br>  dont get me wrong i love the breed but would never reccamend them lightly... NOT because i think i am superior and think only me and a few others should own the breed... i just think people should wait until their older...go to shows and maybe work at a husky recsue before deciding <<< lets put it this way.. they are NOT for first time dogs for first time owners..although it was my first breed i luckily had experienced people helping me the whole way!<br>  <br>  im not sure about bernses moutain dogs, however i have found people say their fav first breeds are:<br>  - goldens<br>  -labs<br>  -spaniels<br>  -setters<br>  and <br>  poodles<br>  <br>  make your choice carefully as dogs are not disposable and and are for life,<br>  good luck and i hope this enlightned you somwhat :D|`|386fa1284d4c180bfe964db1309fabd1aa	Not a husky. A husky is a very active, working, pack-based dog that needs several hours of stimulation every day. They make very poor pets unless owned by a very experienced handler. You wouldn't buy a racehorse to keep as a chold's pony - you shouldn't buy a husky as a house pet. <br>  <br>  The Bernese mountain dog is generally speaking a much easier dog to handle and keep and makes a rather good house dog. However, I would seriously suggest that unless somebody can come home at lunch-time to give the dog a break that you shouldn't really be considering having a dog at all. I know that many people will say 'Oh I have a dog and he's left all day and he's fine' but I'm sure that if you asked the dog for his opinion it would be rather different. Also remember that when you want to move on to college or leave home then your parents may not be too pleased to be left with a large, ageing dog to look after.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	I advise not getting a dog if your are going to be gone for that long. Definitely not a husky as they are a very high-energy dog.|`|0TghwMJqaa	i actually thing the opposite of what other people are saying.<br>  <br>  I have a siberian, and a friend of mine has a bernese.<br>  <br>  compared to the bernese, my boy is a friggin angel. The bernese is a little bastard. Seriously, he's huge, he jumps, bites, barks, everything a dog should be taught by now.. he still does. It's terrible.<br>  <br>  i couldn't imagine my life without a husky, but with that being said you may run into some issues with the lack of space you have and possibly the hours you go to school.<br>  <br>  our lot size is 170 x 79 and sometimes thats not even enough room for my boy, and that's also with daily walking.<br>  <br>  If you're serious about getting a dog, i would really weigh out the pros and cons and go from there. You may have to jog every day and walk everyday. They're an amazing breed, but not for everyone and they require a lot of work.<br>  <br>  from the experience i've had with the bernese.. that would be the last dog i would purchase.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Defiantly not a Husky.  They need a LOT of exercise!  And they aren't good first time dog owners.  <br>  I would go with a Bernese Mountain dog.  They are usually easier.<br>  But I don't think you should consider a dog.  If your gone that long.  It's just not fair to the animal.  Wait until your ready.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	Like the rest, I would not suggest a husky.  The amount of energy would not be conducive to being alone all day.<br>  <br>  Of the 2 choices, I love ther mountain dog, but you may want to consider other options especially since you and your family are gone for several hours a day with work and school.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you may want a dog out of the puppy, puppy stage as they do require a lot more attention.  <br>  <br>  So far I am the minority in saying it is OK to have him home alone, but if you exercise him well daily and pay a lot of attention to him including training, the dog will be fine.  It is actually great that he would only have 2 days a week that he would be alone for an extended period of time.<br>  <br>  Maybe visit a shelter or a breed rescue to find your forever pet.
oMmBhWK4aa	It's very highly recommended to ignore any rubbish petshop employees tell you in order to sell you a tiny bowl for any fish. If you're really concerned for your fish, please get a proper standard tank (at least 5 gallons) with a filter. You'll see a world of difference in activity for a betta living in a decent tank compared to a bowl or jam jar. <br>  <br>  The general facts about bettas are: <br>  - naturally aggressive & territorial, <br>  - males are more aggressive than females, <br>  - they have a higher tendency to fight other bettas & those from same family (gourami, paradise fish), those with similar colors & finnage. But note most of the betta's aggression is just for show, it rarely ends in a real fight<br>  - sometimes the betta is the victim instead of aggressor since his long fins are tempting for fin nippers like certain tetras & barbs.<br>  - they are labyrinth fish, meaning they have a special organ that allows them to breathe atmospheric air directly. This makes some people naively think there's no need for filters or airstones for bettas.<br>  - In their native Thailand (and surrounding countries), they can be found in rice paddies (which are massive though shallow bodies of water, certainly not small puddles as many believe), small streams & canals running through cities.<br>  <br>  Bettas can be real fussy about food. Personally I would recommend a staple diet of Hikari Bio-Gold betta pellets, just a few pellets once a day or every 2 days. And occasional treats of frozen or dried bloodworms. Live mosquito larvae would be a food they're used to in the wild, but suggest not to deliberately breed mozzies due to the risk of dangerous mosquito-borne diseases. Bettas have small stomachs, so don't be tempted to overfeed though they are good at begging!<br>  <br>  Regularly check the temperature of the water and also water parameter readings like pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and kH. The temp should be 75-82F, water should be soft and acidic (pH 6 - 6.5). You can lower the pH & simulate a natural habitat by adding blackwater extract or cheaper way is using dried oak leaves or Indian almond leaves (the brown tint of the water is natural). You need to do regular water changes to control water quality as bettas are sensitive to poor quality water. <br>  <br>  To make him feel comfortable, have floating plants to diffuse tank lighting and some other plants or decor to act as hiding places for security. Bettas like broad leaved plants where they can take a rest on. Make sure that anything used in the tank has no sharp or jagged edges that might tear his fins.|`|ElyP5kLMaa	Bettas<br>  1. Thay are easily get sick.. if water temp under 75F.<br>  2. Clean water, I see u alredy got this cover.<br>  3. Bettas food, everything he/she can eat with-in 2 mins, 1 or 2 x's a day. Don't over feed.<br>  4. You said fish bowl, i guess no filter system, water change 10-15% water 1 or 2x a week.<br>  Good luck and hope it helps|`|UEIAV00Jaa	if you plant something over the top of the tank that they are in then they can live off of the plant roots and the plant doesn't get harmed.... ive done his before : )|`|aru19IwLaa	Hello there!<br>  <br>  Youre heading in the right direction!! I love how youre putting him in a 5 gallon instead of a cruel bowl. Ok so, the 5 gallon needs to stay warm between 72-82. Youre betta will thrive in warm water. With food, you will only need to feed him 3-4 pellets every day or every other day. If you currently live in a cold area, i suggest a heater. I dont have a heater in mine because I live in Florida and its usually warm here. The filter show be a low flow filter or the betta will get pushed around the tank and get stressed. Hope this helped!|`|q9aRldvPaa	i would get a propper fish tank for ur betta they like lots of room to swim around and they like places to hide too if u are getting bettas dont get 2 males cos they will fight|`|cfPz3sxGaa	whats a betta?|`|FBSXz8L9aa	buy it some brine shrimps and things too and dont overfeed with it being in a bowl, dont worry if it doesnt move about much my one is very lazy.
DEdtNBBSaa	You know, we've really been taken for fools when it comes to commercial cat food.  In fact, studies show that since we've been feeding our cats and dogs these products they have developed more diseases than that of cats that eat a raw meat diet.  That's right, raw meat.  I realize that sounds like a bit of a transition, but you'll find you kitty does much better and it does not cost more than commercial stuff.  I wrote an article below about commercial cat food - I warn you its pretty grim.  It also shares how you can include a homeopathic remedy in his diet to help strengthen his immune system too.  Best, Kate|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Cats puke. It can be for medical reasons or just because. From too much exercise, eating too fast, drinking too much water, etc. <br>  <br>  If the cat is acting fine now I'd leave him be. If he continues to vomit then taking him into the emergency vet or regular vet would be a good idea as it could be something medical and prolonged vomiting can lead to dehydration. If he becomes lethargic or has any other uncommon behaviors going to the vet would also be wise.|`|DzJMU6lzaa	it's okay dont worry. my cat did this before several times. we thought it was the food...turned out we were right. try changing the food. his body might be rejecting it. also make sure it's not wet food from a can. those are usually dangerous and are recalled a lot (look it up on google). Also your cat might be eating something else that's getting in the way of his digestive tract which is causing him to throw up. i recently had a party and my cat was eating the shiny tinsel onone of those party streamers that he found on the floor and he threw up the shiny stuff and some of his food. if your cat throws up his/her food again, try replacing the food.|`|z2cysiEhaa	Yeah cats puke from time to time and the noise they make is horrible.

P8Q39vA4aa	Actually dogs can digest grains to a certain extent. All mammals have a cecum. Rice is one of the better grains for dogs. Specially in sick dogs it helps to firm up stool so they don't lose to much water weight. we feed our pups baby food first then add in the rice mixture. Dogs ARE omnivores and need a balance diet that includes grains.|`|AA11317789	They can digest them to a certain extent. They need carbohydrates and they do digest rices better than things like corn.

iIGOi2Idaa	She's OK to go in an enclosed backyard, provided you know no other dogs have been in it, but she should not be on the ground outside or having contact with other dogs of unknown vaccination histroy at all until her vaccination is complete, which will not be until 1 week after her final injection. <br>  <br>  Chalice|`|FdcWPp48aa	You should not take the pup where other dogs are or have been until she is fully vaccinated.<br>  <br>  If you have to take her anywhere, carry her.  She should never touch the ground outside of your yard as the risks of catching Parvo or Distemper is high.  I would even carry her when you take her to the vets for vaccinations, lots of sick dogs come to the vets and many pups are actually exposed to such diseases when they visit the vet for vaccinations.|`|BiMeb75Gaa	You can take her outside if you carry here but you should wait until she has her vaccines or she could catch something.|`|e50edc701ca7a4e8c4b48c44b142d895aa	no dog should be taken out before all the vaccines are completed!!|`|NX23JRGEaa	No pup should be removed from the litter b4 8 weeks old, then it is usually Ok to take the vaccinated pup to Puppy Kindergarten as long as the other pups are also done which any good obed school requires proof of. If you wait to socialize the pup you miss valuable time, I take my 8 week old pups out esp to WalMart to meet lots of people. At WalMart they see 100 people walk by the bench we are sitting on, out of the 100, 20 say "Oh, look at the puppy" and 10 pet. So the dog sees many people going by, kids, strollers, wheeelchairs, colored people, people in hats and long coats, bearded guys, people with dark sunglasses etc and realize people are harmless. The fact they learn that not all people will pet them means they wait until invited to meet new people instead of just going up to anyone. I obed train my new pups from 8 weeks on as well but in 15 min lessons. Most dogs are taken to shelters for behavior problems so early socialization to new people, situations, traffic etc helps a pup be a confident, well behaved, friendly adult. I have had pups since 1973 and NOT ONE got sick from being taken around other vaccinated dogs, around people, being walked in my neighborhood, dog shows or obed classes. I started their show careers at 4 mos old in match shows and bench shows at 6 mos. Personally I would not take a pup to a dog park except on lead during a very slow time as parks are not well policed and many aggressive dogs are allowed.   Here is our local early Puppy Kindergarten class---  Puppy Level 1A (9-15 weeks old)  Register Now!<br>  Class Fee $65*<br>  Class Length 4 Weeks<br>  <br>  All motivational and positive methods are used in our puppy socialization class! <br>  This class covers basic cues and problem prevention. <br>  All training is done on a flat buckle collar. <br>  Maximum class size is 8 dogs; minimum class size is 3 dogs. <br>  Please see our Class Policies for more information. <br>  Puppies attend all 4 weeks.     I also like to use a Puppy sized agility course and take all my pups to the gun range to get them used to gunshots.                                                      What Happens If You Don't Properly Socialize Your Puppy?<br>  <br>  <br>  An unfortunate but undeniable fact is that the number one reason why dogs end up being euthanized is through a lack of socialization (from the associated problems that arise). The sad part is that socializing your puppy isn't really that difficult.<br>  If you miss the crucial puppy socialization period it's not something you can catch up on later - you have deadlines you must meet!<br>  You end up with a dog that is an outcast to society, one that doesn't fit in and can't be trusted. Sadly there are many dogs in this very situation living out their days permanently confined to the back yard.<br>  Dogs who miss the critical socialization period often exhibit shyness, aggression, timidity, fear towards people, dogs and other animals. They are also often inept at relating with other dogs.<br>  f your puppy is deprived of early social stimulation the result is her physical and emotional health can be irreversibly compromised.<br>  Unexpected events and new experiences are not well received by unsocialized dogs. What we strive for in our dogs is a happy balance between them being cautious and having the confidence to accept and explore new things.|`|MKuDawP7aa	THE PRENATAL PERIOD - before birth - adverse experiences for the pregnant mother may affect the behaviour of the offspring. These include the lack of a balanced diet or a stressful experience such as being hit by a car.<br>  <br>  THE NEONATAL PERIOD - birth to 2 weeks - a constant human interference will interrupt the instinctive relationship between mother and puppy and can have a detrimental effect on the pup in later life. A puppy who has never had a human touch or external stimulation can grow up less confident and emotionally stable. The need for a happy balance is important if future stability is needed. The needs of a puppy at this stage are; food, warmth, rest, urination and defaecation.<br>  <br>  THE SOCIALIZATION PERIOD -3 to 12 weeks - This happens rapidly and is when particular responses are acquired most readily and bonds are made. The socialisation period is characterised by interactions with family, people and its surroundings. The pup learns how to dominate or submit during this stage. Environmental issues at this stage have the greatest effect on the behaviour as an adult.<br>  <br>  THE JUVENILE PERIOD - 12 weeks to 2 years - This happens at the end of the socialization period but the timing is not clear cut. Many puppies regress at around 6 months old when they have a heightened awareness of stimuli previously tolerated such as traffic or strangers which can provoke a fearful response. The puppy is now old enough to start training to heel and stay on command. This can only be for short periods at a time to begin with at first.<br>  <br>  THE ADULTHOOD PERIOD - 2years old is generally accepted as the age of adulthood. This is when entire male dogs make a bid for dominance, either challenging the owner or other dogs in the house. Traumatic experiences which occur during the socialization period between 3 and 12 weeks of age can have a detrimental consequences and attribute to behaviour problems during adult life. This period is characterized by interactions with it's litter mates, it's mother, with people and the surroundings.<br>  <br>  The more POSITIVE experiences that the puppy encounters during this time, the more stable the puppy will be going into adulthood. It should be remembered that this is usually a very stressful time for a puppy as usually they are re-homed at around this age and if the move is traumatic it can have an affect on the adult dog.<br>  <br>  The best circumstances in which to buy a puppy include;<br>  <br>  HOME-REARED - where the puppy has been exposed to human handling along with a variety of everyday sights, sounds and smells.<br>  <br>  HEALTHY AGE - no younger than 6 weeks of age.<br>  <br>  TEMPERAMENT - of both ***** and dog should be observed and the bitches behaviour with the puppies.<br>  <br>  THE NEW HOME - should be as similar as possible to the old home to minimize stress. Most of these points are common sense but people still buy puppies at 4 weeks old, without seeing the mother, from a pet shop, or a puppy that has been ill. They then wonder why they experience problems later.<br>  <br>  There are arguments for and against the BEST age to separate a puppy from its mother.<br>  <br>  Puppies bought from pet shops or puppy farms are likely to have problems as adults as are puppies who have suffered illness, they suffer from fear induced aggression or excessive barking; this is a result of forced isolation and painful experiences.<br>  <br>  Puppies that leave their mother at a relatively late time such as 16 - 24 weeks can show an increased fear of other dogs and traffic. This may be due to a kennel - reared upbringing or a lack of stimuli.<br>  <br>  Some psychologists believe that puppies should stay with the mother until 12 weeks of age as before this time puppies are very vulnerable but this is also after the crucial stages of socialization.<br>  <br>  Puppies removed at 6 weeks showed a loss of appetite, increased distress and a susceptibility to illness.<br>  <br>  The optimum time for socialization is between 6 - 8 weeks when the puppy's instinct to make friends with strangers overcomes its natural wariness and is why it is advocated the ideal time to remove the puppy from its mother and litter mates to a new home.<br>  <br>  There are gaps in our current knowledge of the early development of behaviour problems. We do not know a great deal about what crosses the placenta to the unborn puppy and this may affect behaviour.<br>  <br>  Research shows that puppies are particularly vulnerable to psychological damage resulting in behavioral problems. With children we can monitor progress through interview, dream interpretation and free association but with our puppies we can only guess at what might have occurred.|`|Wt61EclRaa	I personally wouldn't risk exposing my dogs to anything until he/she is Protected and has recieved all shots.

uec7RIhbaa	there are a thousand flatwork moves you can do - i'll list a few, any you don't understand look up as you'll get far too bored if i sit here sdescribing them all aswell.... ok first up try varying your pace within a gait - looking for lengthening and shortening.  circles can be all different sizes from 20m, 15m, 10m - whatever you fancy.  try 3 or 4 or 5 loop serpentines, these can include circles to help increase flexibility, bend and suppleness.  try jug handles and demi-voltes, figures of eight.  once you've done this stuff (not to mention the usual transitions etc) work on your lateral moves - leg yield and shoulder-in are a good place to start - then begin incorporating these leateral moves into your school figures - increasing and decreasing circles using leg yield for example or shoulder in then lengthened strides.<br>  <br>  With your poles try having them widely spaced and see if you can get an extra or less strides in between them (coming back to the shortening and lengthening again here!!), try your transitions dead on the poles, try creating a little "trcak" or "tunnel" of poles that is narrow that you have to go through and keep your horse from stepping outside the lines.  With the cones you can practise your bending etc getting as fast as you can (and possibly improving on any simple of flying changes you may have been working on on the flat) you can get a few whips and practise the "flag race" or use the cones and poles to build ytourself a little jump course.  also, practise your own riding stuff - do work without your stirrups and do some exercises, practise riding with one hand (or no hands!!), try riding canter or the "waltz" (rise for 2 beats then down for 1 instead of up, down, up, down).  Any combination of this stuff will be fun for you and the horse and will help with the training and improvement of both of you.<br>  <br>  Each time you head out to ride try to decide what you plan to acheive that day - for example "i want to stop my horse falling in or improve bend or hind leg impulsion and activity" - then see how you might do it - for example "i'll use changes of bend to ensure he can't begin to anticipate the turns and therefore fall in, I'll use leg yield on the long side and on the circle to get him off my inside leg and the hind legs engaged" etc etc.  If you have a goal in mind you will be much better equipped to actually feel like you got something out of it and have acheived something which is very important if you're beginning to feel a bit aimless.|`|lNfv18Bsaa	dressage has a lot of things in.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Serpentines are good, aim for accuracy, clear instructions about change of direction, remember to change diagonal on centre line.<br>  <br>  Half halts.<br>  <br>  Frequent changes of rein in as many different ways as you can.<br>  <br>  Riding without stirrups and making yourself as relaxed as possible.<br>  <br>  Trotting poles without stirrups and with stirrups, aim to ride strongly enough around the arena that the horse does not have to change strides over the pole.  When you get the rest right, the pole work will be right and you will not notice a change in stride.<br>  <br>  Carry two mugs of water as you are riding. Practise trotting around with and without stirrups to keep the water in the cups.  This teaches balance, non-reliance on reins and stillness of hands.  Secret is to open and close the elbows as you rise.  Having said that, your hands should not be rigid.<br>  <br>  Change reins in as many different ways as possible, across diagonal, down and up centre line, half circles etc, remembering to change diagonal as you go....<br>  <br>  Just a few things to keep you occupied.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Work without poles/cones-<br>  <br>  Practice a lot of bending (inside bend, outside bend, etc). This will be helpful for shows and just for your horse in general.<br>  <br>  While trotting, do a lot of "change of hand", circles around jumps, center of the ring, serpentines, etc.<br>  <br>  Does your horse do lead changes? You can have your horse practice those. Or if he's not ready for those, polish up on your simple changes. And if you're a good enough rider, you can also try to teach him flying lead changes. (if you want to teach him, just email me for advice because that's a whole other topic).<br>  <br>  You can also practice halting and going and canter voice commands.<br>  <br>  Pole work-<br>  <br>  You can either trot or canter poles. Though I normally dislike cantering them unless I'm working with lead changes. You can do a lot of different things with poles.<br>  <br>  Instead of just having them in one straight line, you can almost make a "course" with them, except there's no jumping. Just think of weird little obstacles that has your horse excerising is brain really good. <br>  <br>  **Just make sure everything is spaced correctly.<br>  <br>  Cones-<br>  <br>  Set up a straight line of cones through the center of the ring (good space inbetween for your horse). And practice weaving in and out of them at the trot. Then, if spaced correctly and you have a good enough seat, you can weave through them at the canter.<br>  <br>  You can also place cones randomly about the ring and practice a canter or trot circle around each one.<br>  <br>  Cones and Poles-<br>  <br>  It's important to get your horse to really use his or her brain to get them going. I would set up a really neat obstical using both. Just make sure it's reasonable and spaced out correctly.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|PUspAGxFaa	try doing some figure 8s at the trot and canter. it will help with your balance and get you better with your balance on flying lead changes. also, try spreading the ground poles farther apart and cantering over them|`|39URNi1Raa	Have a go at serpentines, its where you spilt the riding school into sections a 3 loop sepentine would go from a the a loop, f to k, e to b, m to h|`|SGemQuF2aa	You could try pretending you are at a gymkhana. The cones and poles can be made into loads of different variations of one thing.<br>  <br>  For the cones, you can weave in and out of them in trot. Then try weaving in trot as fast can you can. Then give it a go in a slow canter, but trot when you turn. Or put them as a triangle and do some barrel racing. This can be good fun.<br>  <br>  For the poles set out a little narrow pathway.Then you have to go in the middle without touching a pole. You could try some turns and transitions as well. <br>  <br>  <br>  I did this once before: <br>  <br>  At one end of the arena, A or C, put all the cones (maybe 3) down the centre line like you are going to wind in between them. Leave some space near the wall for a pole to be your starting line. Put one pole at the other end to be the finish line. <br>  <br>  You start by cantering from the start pole to the finish pole, and back again. <br>  Then weave through the first and second cone (leave the others) and canter to the finish pole and back again. <br>  <br>  And  do the same and keep increasing the number of cones you go through. There's so many different ways of doing this!<br>  <br>  If you are confident enough, do ALL this without stirrups.

j45Q2ipRaa	Yes it is supposed to be more that consistency than the fluffy rice that we eat.|`|FaPrr8bbaa	If it looks like oatmeal or mush then it has enough liquid absorbed into it so it won't constipate the dog.  This is difficult to achieve in a rice cooker unless you run it through 3 cycles adding more water each time.|`|9kTejB0uaa	I prefer to use long-grain rice for my dogs.

I wish my cats did that lol. both of mine are very independent and don't do too much cuddling. You're cat loves you and probably in many ways thinks that they are "human" or that you're another cat.

Lucky you to have such a loving kitty.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	I love her and I don't mind all of this affection, but I'm wondering: does anybody else have a cat like this?   Yes, my big guy is like that.... if I'm on the sofa, he's in my lap, and follows me room to room and sleeps with me... wakes me up in the morning by kissing me and nuzzling me...  it's a wonderful thing<br>  <br>  Is this normal?     "normal".... normal is whatever is normal for that particular cat and acceptable to the human.... kitties are strange creatures and they're all unique and different, it's not abnormal by any stretch of the imagination.<br>  <br>  Is it because I lavished attention on her when I got her?    Most likely.  Cats tend to develop their personalities based on how their humans treat them..... the more interaction they get growing up the more highly interactive they will be when they grow up.... there are some exceptions to that, but for the most part it holds true.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on having a serious "mushface" as a cat... it shows the animal has gotten lots of love and learned to return it.... makes her a joy to have around, doesn't it?|`|vL1Wcrqoaa	awwwww adorable <br>  i wish i have a cat like her <br>  maybe because sometimes you are away from her 2-3 days|`|X67Y1BACaa	My kitten is like that.

At night, when I want to go to bed, she'll wait outside of my bedroom door and try to get in (unfortuantly, I cant let her in because she will break everything). When I go to the bathroom, she'll follow me and sit with me in there, or if she doesn't come in right away, she stick her arm under the bathroom door so ill let her in. In the morning, she sticks her arm under my door when she knows im awake, and then she'll follow me in the bathroom and downstairs.|`|IuYekkPVaa	All cats are different and like people, some are just more openly affectionate than others.<br>  <br>  Your cat sounds adorable, and a lot like my previous cat Holly.

Though I've had lots of affectionate cats, none of them bonded with me in quite the same way that she did.  <br>  <br>  I think that some cats are "the one" and you're lucky to have met yours.

n4pNNcGfaa	He just plain needs to get out more.  What he needs to learn isn't about bicycles and kites, but about encountering new things in general.  And the only way for him to develop a constructive way of dealing with new situations is to experience a whole lot of new situations.<br>  <br>  So you can work with desensitization exercises, which the other answer explained thoroughly, but unless you show him many more new experiences as well it won't resolve the problem.  Basically he needs a whole lot more of what we call "proofing," or distraction training.  A good trainer can give you a a good start on proofing techniques in just one session.|`|2gb6zN1raa	Basically you need to change the association of bikes and noisy teasing boys - to bikes and calm and reward.<br>  <br>  This means, getting a bike and just laying it in a large open area and slowly and calmy walking around it in  large circles talkingto your dog all the time in a relaxed and pleased manner, 'good boy' - do not over praise or use excitable tone.<br>  <br>  If he is comfortable at a certain distance - decrease the distance of the circles around the bike until he can sit next to it.<br>  <br>  Do this by calm praise when HE IS NOT SHOWING SIGNS OF STRESS and when he does show signs of stress - DO NOT SAY ANYTHING but slowly and calmly ignore leash pulling and go back to a larger circle where he was comfortable until he relaxes - when he relaxes again - praise you dog with calm tones and a pat onthe back.<br>  <br>  When you can eventually get near to the bike have a favorite toy ready or a sqeaky toy or a food reward.  When he gets so close to the bike squeak the toy or give him the food reward and calm praise.<br>  <br>  It is important througn all this - not to give excited or over the top praise - we need his adrenaline steady not up and down ok.<br>  <br>  So - when he learns that beingnear the bike brings a reward ... throw a toy over the other side of the bike and ask him to fetch - he will either go around it forgetting it as focused on toy - or take the short cut and jump over it.<br>  <br>  Do this a number of times and when he is totally comfortable around it ... move him away from the bike and have someone stand the bike up and secure it in a standing position.<br>  <br>  Repeat all of the above.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is important you dont short cut this and start with a standing bike - as it is taller and more imposing stood up but on the floor - just like a lying down dog - it is a submissed, low posture and is less threatening to your dog.<br>  <br>  ONce he is fine with a standing bike dont get on the bike but hold your dog on your left hand side on a leash .. (walking to heal)... and push slowly and with no fast movement the bike with your right hand.<br>  <br>  This is the same as two dogs walking next to eachother instead of frontal position - which put the dog in challenge  / reactive mode ... a dog walking next to another takes the tension out of the meeting or walk ... and is seen as polite behaviour by other dogs.<br>  <br>  So walk the dog on left calmly, and the bike on right slowly - do not reward your dog if showing signs of stress or fear - dont pat your dog to 'rassure him' as this rewards his behavoiour in that moment (fear) wait til he relaxes and then pat him and ssay good boy.<br>  <br>  Continue to do this until you are sure the dog is not 'eye balling' or wincing away from the object/bike.   When he seems confident the bike does not bring negative things with it ..let your dog off the leash without saying a word or looking at your dog (keep it as normal and calm as possible as if its no big deal to release him while you hold the bike) and do not look at him at all - confidently walk forward - and your dog should (if you have basic command of him) follow you as the packleader.<br>  <br>  If he doesnt place the bike down get your dog on leash walk him till calm and proceed to stand the bike andwalk again.<br>  <br>  If he does follow start changing direction or speeding up the movement of bike being careful not to pamper your dog when you make these changes - let your dog rely on his new found confidence to work it out for himslef that there is no threat.<br>  <br>  When comfortable... sit on bike and do not move. Stay there for a few second and get off the bike, and walk as before ...ignoring your dog so he finds for himself there is no threat.<br>  <br>  Repeat and stay on bike for longer each time.<br>  <br>  Finally you should be able to ride the bike at average speed with him following at this point you can make it fun - so ride the bike and say ''weeeeeee good boy ..come on boy - come ...weeeee' ..big smily face and perhaps even throw a toy to the side ...<br>  <br>  When he has seen his leader doing it and having fun - he will not fret with others on a bike.<br>  <br>  Do the same for a kite.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
zlVqLur4aa	Chameleons need a well ventilated cage which is one of the reasons screen is recommended for them. A top only screen is not going to provide that. Try for at least two sides being screen as well if you can. They also don't deal well psychologically with glass, both the reflections from it  and their inability to climb on it cause them stress. Very young chams can be kept in a tank but juveniles to adults really do much better in a screen cage.

This attitude often gets them in more trouble than they can handle. They can be aggressive with other small pets, such as cats, gerbils and rabbits. Terriers like to dig. The Yorkshire terrier is no different in this respect. And more often than not, Yorkshire Terriers like to bark. Also being typical of the terriers, their lifespan is around 15 years.<br>  <br>  If your Yorkie becomes spoiled enough he or she can and will run the household. This is a breed that can become quite manipulative. However, living with a well-bred Yorkshire terrier can be loads of fun if you can learn to properly train or provide professional training for him or her. The Yorkshire terrier can simply be one of the most delightful pet companions you will ever own.<br>  <br>  Before purchasing a Yorkshire terrier, give some thought as to whether or not, this strong little personality can unite with you in harmony. You might want to consider the following factors before purchasing a Yorkshire terrier:<br>  <br>  ? How much time do you have to devote to a Yorkshire terrier pet companion? Yorkies are little people and they love to spend time with their owners. They can be very miserable if left unattended for hours on end.<br>  <br>  ? Living with a Yorkshire terrier is almost like having a child, except the Yorkshire terrier remains childlike even in later adult years. In essence the Yorkshire terrier never grows up, and will always require your care and supervision.<br>  <br>  ? Do you have a fenced yard? For the safety of a Yorkshire terrier, a fenced yard is essential. A Yorkshire terrier may not run away from home, but is more apt to be distracted by the tweeting sound of a bird, and follow that sound right out into the street. Please be sure the fence does not have large holes or gaps as he or she can slip right through. Don't forget the Yorkie is a terrier and may also just dig right under the fence. Digging is one of the Yorkshire terriers many talents. It is a part of their heritage, not necessarily something bad, just something they are most talented at doing.<br>  <br>  ? Is this your first small toy dog? If you have always owned larger breeds, you must realize the Yorkshire terrier is going to be much different.<br>  <br>  ? Yorkshire terriers are generally active and will need exercise and lessons in manners. Are you able to provide these lessons?<br>  <br>  ? Do you have small children? Usually, the Yorkshire terrier do not fair well with small children. Young kids are not suitable companions for the delicate Yorkie. Older children may be perfect companions, however, if taught to handle the Yorkshire terrier appropriately. The Yorkshire terrier does not tolerate mistreatment from children. This is unlike a Lab or a Golden Retriever, who will allow a small child to ride on his back or pull his ears or tail. A Yorkshire terrier could be severely injured if mishandled, and may become aggressive as well.<br>  <br>  ? Having time for a dog of any breed does not mean that you cannot work nor have a life otherwise. However, especially with the toy breeds and the Yorkshire terrier, your pet will need quality time just as a child needs quality time.<br>  <br>  ? A Yorkshire terrier will require at least two feedings a day and needs to be exercised several times a day.<br>  <br>  ? A Yorkshire terrier will require holding and plenty of affection and attention. You must work with a Yorkshire terrier to have an obedient dog with good manners.<br>  <br>  ? The small size of a Yorkshire terrier makes him perfect for apartment living, and/or other small quarters, as well as just about any other type of accommodations.<br>  <br>  ? Yorkshire terriers require a fair amount of daily grooming, as well as regular professional grooming to keep them looking and feeling their best.|`|QVuAylAlaa	Jan has given you an excellant response - I just wanted to add that it may seem the opposite case to you - but in actuality, owning a small dog, especially one as small as a yorkie is more expensive than owning a large dog.  Every medical issue that comes up is going to cost twice as much because these little guys do not do well under general anestisia, so small things like teeth cleaning (which is an absolute must for small dogs who are prone to teeth problems) will cost twice as much.  They also live longer than larger breeds so they have more geriatric problems as they live into their teens.  If you are worried about time and commitment, this is definetely not a breed for you (and as the last poster wrote - you need to honestly assess whether this is the right time to get a dog - any breed - at all).|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Smart and self-assured, the Yorkshire Terrier is a combination of endearingly small size and adventurous terrier.

What is heat?<br>  <br>  Heat is more properly called the estrous cycle. During this cycle, female dogs may get pregnant. It’s equivalent to human menstruation.<br>  <br>  2. What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  Females bleed from the vagina sometimes with swelling of the vulva and increased urination. Don’t expect bleeding comparable to a human female.<br>  <br>  For small dogs, it’s usually not much and you may need to pay close attention to your puppy to identify her first cycle. Other than the bleeding, the most noticeable symptom may be <br>  male dogs hanging around your house.<br>  <br>  3. When does a dog come into heat?<br>  <br>  The average female dog has her first cycle about six months of age. A few dogs start earlier and few dogs later, even as late as 14-months.<br>  <br>  If you have a new female puppy, you should watch her and note when she has her first cycle. If she’s 14-months old and still hasn't’t been in heat, you should take her to a veterinarian.<br>  <br>  4. How long does the heat cycle last?<br>  <br>  The average is three weeks or 21-days. In some dogs, it lasts only two weeks while others go four weeks.<br>  <br>  5. How often will she be in heat?<br>  <br>  Most female dogs have regular cycles usually every six to eight months. It’s quite typical to be in heat twice a year.<br>  <br>  6. When can she get pregnant?<br>  <br>  She can get pregnant only when in heat. Some breeders <br>  test for progesterone levels to identify the most fertile days but the rule-of-thumb is that the most fertile days are 11-15 of her cycle.<br>  <br>  Note – when she’s in heat, the average dog will permit any male <br>  dog to mount her. Few females, however, will accept a male when <br>  they’re not in heat.<br>  <br>  7. Can she get pregnant her first cycle?<br>  <br>  Yes. However, responsible breeders generally would not breed a dog that early. For one thing, you need to do genetic testing and some serious problems such as hip conditions do not show up until a dog is approximately 2-years of age.<br>  <br>  8. Can I take her on walks during this cycle?<br>  <br>  Yes with care. She has no problem with the exercise but she’s a walking magnet for male dogs.<br>  <br>  Even the best trained and behaved female dog will succumb to hormones. You can’t trust her off a leash or out of your control. Never let her outside by herself even in a fenced yard if there is any possibility of male dogs nearby.<br>  <br>  For walks, if there are male dogs in your neighborhood, it’s a good idea to take your dog in your car and drive to a remote area. Take her for the walk there and drive back home. Otherwise, the scent of her urine and vaginal discharge will blaze a trail to your home.<br>  <br>  9. When I can have her spayed?<br>  <br>  The answer to that one has changed continually over the <br>  25-years I’ve been in the dog business. People used to be told to let their dog go through at least one cycle or let them have one litter.<br>  <br>  Today, veterinarians are doing it much earlier. Some vets spay as early as 6-weeks of age! Talk to your veterinarian about your dog and the vet’s preferences. The state of veterinary medicine also is much improved over the past 25-years.<br>  <br>  10. If I don’t have her spayed, will she go through menopause.<br>  <br>  No. Her fertility may decline but she will not go through menopause comparable to a human’s. She won’t lose her ability to become pregnant even as a senior so if you don’t want to her to have any (or more) litters, she must be spayed.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Yes!  Of course she can get pregnant.

2gb6zN1raa	Jan Fennell the 'Dog Whisperer' book outlines Ami Chien Bonding technique.<br>  <br>  It is a consitant approach, aimed at a gentle role change from your dog being the leader (making decision such as leaving garden, crossing roads, antisocial with dogs/humas, feeling he has to protect himself instead of his leader doing that) .. it talks about working on the role exchange in a patient, calm, firm manner in four areas:<br>  1. The Hunt (the walk)<br>  2. Resource control (food)<br>  3. Perceived Danger (you as leader earning his trust and sorting out danger)<br>  4. Attention (the 5 minute ignore rule) which also helps with seperation anxiety if done right as well as helping in role exchange.<br>  <br>  Her book is not expensive its the first one she wrote you need.  Also - go onto You Tube and type in Ceasar Milan and there are over 100 episodes of problem dogs to browse and watch how he handles them.<br>  <br>  Basically though the principle is this:<br>  <br>  By not being a firm and calm leader, the dog feels he has to provide that role.  He will make behavouiral choices, reaction choices, protect himself against what he feels could harm him or steal his space or toy or food ... he sounds at 10 years old like he has not learnt 'negotiation signals' which tell other dogs he is not a threat, but instead immediately gets on the defensive to ensure he is left alone - other dogs see this immdeiately in a wide variety of ways and become reactive to him - so its a vicious cirlce which your dog has sadly been caught in for a long time.<br>  <br>  By becoming a kind, understanding leader that is calm but firm - following methods outlined in the Ami Chien Bonding - you take the STRESS OFF YOUR DOG - the responsibility off your  dog to be leader - and the dog will learn how to relax and become a more willing dog when you ask something off him.<br>  <br>  I suggest initially get a dog behavioursit to assess him though to make sure his is not dominant-aggressive or ask the vet to make sure his anti social behaviour and wild ways are not a hormonal imbalance.<br>  <br>  Be careful not to get angry or frustrated though - as that tells him immediately you are out of control and he will run cirlces around you and not trust you as a leader.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	No. Never yank your dog. Especially with a choke collar. YOu will damage your dog's throat. An appropriate "no" will work if you have taught your dog to respect you.<br>  <br>  The best thing to get him over his fears is positive exposure. Put a basket muzzle on him. Take him to football games, etc. Any places where a lot of people are at. Do not keep your dog outside unattended if your dog can get out and run.<br>  <br>  Teaching your dog recall can help curb this.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	Treats are not always the way to train a dog.  You need to figure out what motivates yours.  Some dogs are motivated by praise.  When you get what you are asking, get a real happy exuberant voice saying good dog and rubbing him happily.<br>  <br>  You may need to start with the basics again and work up starting with respect, eye contact and release and recall.<br>  <br>  Until things are better, you may not want to leave him unsupervised so that he isn't tempted to take an unscheduled trip.<br>  <br>  For the men and other dogs, that will be a constant effort.  When he starts to look at the men or other dogs, regain his focus on you and keep doing what you were doing even if you are just taking a walk.  Make him acknowledge that you are his leader and you will protect him.  He doesn't need to be the alpha as you have that covered.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Right!   And now you can tell us just how you came to get hold of the injectible penicillin...*sigh*<br>  <br>  Since you clearly haven't taken the dog to a vet then how do you know he has parvo?<br>  You are not a health professional or you would know how to spell Pedialyte.<br>  <br>  Is it a full moon or are you just full of it.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	If your dog has parvo he needs to be taken to the vet.  It is crucial that he gets proper meds as soon as possible.  My 11 week old german shepherd puppy just recovered from parvo.  At the first sign that there was something wrong I took him to the vet.  He was lethargic and did not want to eat for a whole day.  Anyway vet kept him and gave him treatment. He was there for 3 days and now is 100% better.  But I was advised by the vet that he responded so well to treatment because I brought him in early.  I did not wait for the diarrhea and vomiting to start. This made all the difference since the virus did not do alot of damage yet. So I really encourage you to take him to the vet, some charge outrageous prices because they do alot of unnecessary stuff.  Mine only charged $100 for everything including his 2nd set of shots and worming once he was better.  I wish you luck on finding one that is reasonable with the price and pray you puppy recovers.|`|t8GjNSgDaa	Take him to the vet. Vets often times will send you and your dog home with antibiotics for the dog to take 2 xs per day. you MUST keep the dog confined to either a crate or a small room that is easy to clean up after the dog.The state where I live you can buy the 7 way shot over the counter both from a farm store or from the vet and give it to your dog yourself.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	The disease can kill a dog quite quickly.

Keep in mind that you have two breeds that are hunter type of dogs and terriers are bred to go after smaller animals like rats, etc.  You may or may not have a problem with terriers and cats.  <br>  <br>  Smaller dogs tend to be harder to housebreak and take longer.|`|2VdJgenjaa	I have a labradoodle and I just googled both types of dogs.

I also have a Beagle/labrador/heeler/poodle he's cool. <br>  <br>  We've had pure breeds before him and they just turned out to be total disaters one the contract was so well worded that when he got a genetic disease it was hard to get any help from the breeder.

HA3wlq2Taa	The answer Im sorry to say is love and patience. You dont know what the poor creature went through before it went to the RSPCA. The chances are he didnt have a very happy or loving home. He is lucky now because he is with you. But he cant understand that this is the case, not yet. It takes cats a long time to trust humans. There are two key answers to your problem i think - rescue remedy and a water pistol! Rescue remedy helps to chill animals and humans out - you can get a spray version or a droplet version from any boots and most chemists/health food shops.It is safe and natural so dont worry about using it. The water pistol comes for when he misbehaves - he HAS to know that you are incharge and not him. If he bites you, spray him, if he chases you, spray him....he will soon learn, trust me. It sounds cruel, but really it works. And when he cries for food try to distract him - even the most grown up of cats is a sucker for a laser light or a goldfish on a stick!! Especially the males - they never grow up :) Oh and if you are worried about him being fat, get some lo-fat cat food - you should be able to get if from your vets. Good luck :)|`|A6fWHZmqaa	Listen to Janey- I agree with her answer completely.

Rottweilers are supposed to be24-27 inches for the males.  22-25 inches tall for the females.  So Goldens are approximately the same height as female Rottweilers.  As for weight wise, Rottweilers are about 20 lbs or so heavier than a golden, but not always.   Maximum weight for a golden is to be 75 lbs.  Rottweiler females are to be 80-100 lbs.  So, yes, Rottweilers are generally a little bit bigger than Goldens.  Rottweilers are typically more muscular than Goldens are, and that is were the extra weight, mass comes in.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	In height they are very close, but the weight is a different matter.

iVQULHqYaa	Dogs are usually introduced on neutral territory, however this is difficult with a new puppy. <br>  Get your puppy early in the dog to acclimatize it before your bedtime. Take your puppy into the garden before you take it into the house because it will want a wee. Then get a friend to carry the puppy into the house and introduce your puppy to your dog in a small room.Let your dog sniff the puppy before you put it down, then stand back and watch. Afterwards make a big fuss of the dog and put your puppy into his bed in a separate room. <br>  Puppies are excitable, lovable hooligans. They have bursts of unbelievable energy, however in order to grow they need lots of sleep. New puppies need a room where they can rest and sleep and the other dogs in the house need respite. Older dogs don’t want puppies biting their ears and chewing their necks, if a puppy does this, the older dogs should be allowed to chastise the puppy. How would you cope if you were expected to cope with an unruly toddler twenty four hours a day? Would you be annoyed, if you had a toddler thrust upon you who pulled your hair and poked your eyes? I am sure that you would grumble.<br>  <br>  Please don’t expect your dog to cope with an unruly puppy and to baby-sit twenty four hours a day.  Supervise them for SHORT play sessions in the garden and if the puppy is over exuberant, allow your dog to chastise it, then put your puppy in its own room to rest. Don’t expect your dog to want to sleep with your puppy or to play with it constantly. <br>  <br>  Your puppy will possibly need about four meals a day. Divide your other dog’s rations into four and feed it (or them) when you feed your puppy.  Give your existing dog extra attention when the puppy is resting and make him feels special.<br>  <br>  There will be visitors, who want to see your puppy. When the doorbells rings, put your puppy into another room and tell your visitors to fuss your adult dog or dogs and give them treats BEFORE they make a fuss of the puppy.<br>  <br>  Older dogs love puppies, with the proviso that YOU stop the puppy from being a pain in the bum. They don’t want a puppy being thrust upon them all of the time. If you do this any dog will object and be confused.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  There are resident dogs who don't want to share their territory to new pup.  It's important to be prepared in introducing your new dog or puppy.   This will make your introduction peacefully and orderly.  Here are the tips:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/new-dog-old-dog-training-center.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/new-dog-old-dog-train...</a>|`|4hM6xTptaa	Alright, well the good thing is, as the same size dog, they have more liklihood of getting on better than if you had bought a Great Dane hehe =]<br>  <br>  Dogs think of themselves in packs, so if you can decide which dog will be higher in the hierarchy (I strongly suggest making the pup the 'lower' dog).<br>  You should buy/borrow a crate to put your pup in.<br>  <br>  But firstly, making sure that neither dog sees each other, show the older girl the pup.. by placing the pups back near her nose (make sure shes calmed down before this) so she can sniff .<br>  do the same with the pup... making sure that now eye contact is registered.<br>  <br>  Then.. using the crate, place in the pup.. and let your older girl have a sniff through the bars, if there is a strong stance, or long eye contact, or even growling, a correction is needed, to show (either of them) that their behaviour is wrong.<br>  <br>  Once a good, playful or inquisitive mood is reached.. open the crate door, and let the pup come out by herself. You may need to repeat the first step, so that the dogs know each other are no harm.<br>  <br>  I suggest watching them for half an hour, and only leave alone when you're sure theyre fine. With my dogs, i use seperate things for each.. so seperate bowl, bed, crate etc, so that no jealousy occurs.<br>  <br>  With the son... perhaps.. introduce the dog first?<br>  Make sure your son is facing backwards towards the pup whilst she is in the crate, so that she can have a good sniff. Only then, once she is calm, should you let her... do whatever xDD<br>  <br>  Its very important for her torealise that your son is higher in the pack than she is.. its eases turbulence .<br>  <br>  Ive done this to all my dogs, and they get on well with all dogs, as they were introduced properly and so have no fears.<br>  <br>  One warning.. if somethign does happen, dont snatch up either dog, this just reduces their chance to deal with situations, which wouldnt occur if introductins had occured properly  :)<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!! Im jealous :D i love puppieieessss|`|MKuDawP7aa	Jealousy is a characteristic normally one associates with human beings. But ask experienced observers of animals about this. They will all agree that animals are not inferior by any means to human beings when it comes to certain basic instincts such as jealousy. Even people who have pet dogs can vouch for this fact. When a person brings a new puppy to a house where already a dog exists, the older dog will definitely feel jealous of the new puppy. This jealous attitude of the older dogs is not a healthy phenomenon; at least for the health of the puppy. So, the owner must take extra precautions when bringing a new puppy to the house.<br>  <br>  If you tend to think that you have already mastered the art of bringing up the dogs after successfully training one dog, you are mistaken. You are in for new practical lessons and tutorials when you bring a new puppy to your house. Dogs are highly territorial animals. Breaking in to another dog's territory is equivalent to attacking another country in the actions of human beings. Normally, the dogs mark their respective territories with urine. The smell of the urine is the invisible borderline. Since you have trained the old dog to properly use potty for relieving itself, its first line of border protection cannot be activated. So, do not be surprised if the older dog uncharacteristically starts urinating at the wrong places when a new puppy is brought to home. He is just marking his territories. Also, he may demand more attention from you. That is all because of the fact that the older dog is jealous of the attention the new puppy is getting.<br>  <br>  There are certain things the owners can do to keep things under control. When a person brings a new puppy to the house, he or she has to show more than the normal attention to the old dog. Do not make the two dogs share same crates, toys, and food bowls. One must define a hierarchy of sorts, like the owner first, then the old dog, and then the new puppy. This order should be maintained in all aspects, be it care giving, food giving, or playing.<br>  <br>  Another problem is that the new puppy may not understand the signals of dominance sent by the older dog. So, never leave the puppy with older dog, till both animals become comfortable with each other. A good practice is to play with both animals at the same time.<br>  <br>  It is often recommended that when you bring the new puppy, you have to chain both the animals so that you can control things better. It is also important to take the new puppy to a veterinary doctor. Diseases can be transmitted to the other dog quite easily.

They aren't tiny dogs, so I would say they are medium sized.  They do bark when they hear stuff though, so you may have to work on that.

This summer tasty surprise was presented in the “Iroy” café situated in the centre of Vienna and specialized in Italian ice-cream producing. Dogs visiting cafe were much satisfied with the novelty.<br>  <br>  The idea to produce an ice-cream for dogs was suggested by Simone Leonardini, the café owner and three golden retrievers’ careful master. “In summer heat dogs feel especially bad. They have a dense hair, and when the weather is too hot they are necessarily to chill. My dogs love to bath very much so I have come to a decision that they also would love to taste an ice-cream. More so, many friends often told me that their pets get nuts of ice-cream.”- says Simone.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, usual ice-cream is not good for dogs since it contains such poisonous for an animal substations as milk sugar, fat, various artificial aromatics and other chemical additives. So we were ought to invent a new product. It took about a year. Food additives’ experts helped to select necessary stuff appropriate to the Italian technology of ice-cream producing, but the very retrievers have been regularly working as tasters while searching the necessary components. The experience showed that the dogs were mostly delighted with vanilla ice-cream, though other kinds with natural rice and soybeans added are being greatly appreciated too.<br>  <br>  Visiting the cafe dog masters can order a small or a big ice-cream portion worth of 4.8 and 7 Euro sedately in the special menu for their pets. At a client will the ice-cream can be decorated with a chunky doggy biscuit.<br>  <br>  In the beginning of October the ice-cream for dogs will be selling in shops. The admittance to sell it has been obtained at the Health and Food Products Safety Department which agreed to legitimize the product as a dog seed. Moreover it appeared that Doghissimo is good even for dogs suffering from diabetes.<br>  <br>  Since September local wealthy dog masters are waited with a new temptation: “Animal Dreams” boutique selling collars decorated with crystals Swarowsky or biscuits in gold leaf shell and also other accessories of the Lux class.|`|JcHsq5FSaa	no a dog is extremely sensitive to Sugar so in other words candy and stuff is no good,,<br>  the reason being the sugar can actually destroy the dogs cones and rods making the dog go blind,, so just stick to the hard biscuits and stuff|`|VK11cBvpaa	Well some icecrem can be fed to dogs and some arent.

MKuDawP7aa	If you were to ask what the quickest and easiest method was for teaching your dog a new trick, the answer would be - work with the nature of your dog, not against it. What we mean here is that you should look at what tricks your dog naturally does, or look for a dog trick 'in the making', like naturally putting a paw on your knee or rolling over etc.<br>  <br>  If you choose a dog trick that naturally occurs, half your work is already done. Your dog will probably be eager to please as most dogs are and should therefore respond well to rewards. You can build on this to reinforce your dogs’ natural ability rather than starting an entirely new dog trick.<br>  <br>  Which Dog Trick Do You Choose?<br>  <br>  Observe your dog and watch out for a potential dog trick. This may be something as simple as crawling along on its belly to, catching a Frisbee or a ball. As soon as your dog 'performs' one of it's natural tricks, associate it with a hand gesture or verbal command and then reward your dog with its favorite treat. It won't be long before your dog learns the procedure.<br>  <br>  Eventually over time, you will be able to cut back on the rewards until your dog will perform the dog trick with just the hand gesture or verbal command such as 'fetch' or 'go get'. Now that the new trick is firmly lodged in your dogs' head, you will be able to build on it.<br>  <br>  For example, if you have taught your dog to catch a Frisbee, how about increasing the distance that he will catch it from, or throw two Frisbee’s one after the other. Get your dog to catch one, drop it and then run for the other!<br>  <br>  Popular Dog Tricks<br>  <br>  Some of the most popular dog tricks are 'sit' and 'come' etc. These are pretty simple to teach. To teach your dog to sit, with your dog standing firmly press on its hind quarters directly above it's back legs whilst at the same time saying the word 'Sit' quite assertively but NOT shouting. Most dogs will naturally sit. At this point, heap lots of praise on your dog and then give them a treat. After several repetitions of this, your dog will soon learn what 'Sit' means. Do not try this on older dogs that may have arthritis in their hind legs or hips.<br>  <br>  If your dog does not sit when told, NEVER scold it. Just ignore it and try again another time. Otherwise your dog will associate 'Sit' with being scolded. If your dog persistently fails to sit, try another trick.<br>  <br>  Each dog has different talents.<br>  <br>  To teach your dog to come is simple. When your dog is at a distance, say loudly but not shouting 'Come here' or 'Come'. This will usually get your dogs' attention. Repeat the statement 'Come on', 'Come here'. Most untrained dogs at this point will probably look away and carry on with whatever it was doing.<br>  <br>  At this point walk up to your dog but keep within around 5 feet away. Say 'Come here'. Your dog will probably now come to you. When he does, it's time for a lot of praise and a treat. Repeat this but increase the distance that your dog has to walk towards you more each time. Eventually, your dog will instinctively come to you whenever it hears you shout 'Come here', from any distance.<br>  <br>  Again, if your dog fails to come to you, DO NOT scold it. I once got asked "Why won't my dog come to me?” On further investigation I found out that every time the dog ran away and then failed to come back, the owners would scold the dog when they got hold of it again. WRONG! The dog started to associate the command 'Come here' with a scolding. Totally the opposite. No wonder the dog failed to come to command.<br>  <br>  Another dog trick you can try is 'Paw'. This involves saying 'Paw' then gently lifting the dogs paw with your hand followed by lots of praisetreats. After a while saying 'Paw' will cause your dog to raise its paw. You can extend this to two paws where your dog 'Sits pretty' on its haunches.<br>  <br>  Another trick is 'Speak'. This usually works best with a naturally vocal dog. Every time your dog howls or makes a funny noise, praise the dog whilst saying the command ' Speak'. Eventually your dog will speak on command.<br>  <br>  Teaching your dog a new dog trick should be a fun experience for both of you, and will give you lots of quality time together. Enjoy!|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Tricks are both enjoyable and extremely useful. The good thing about tricks is that everybody smiles, laughs and giggles - the best reward of all. In fact, in no time at all, performing the trick becomes the reward in itself.  Here are the tricks:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-training-tricks-dunbar.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/dog-training-tricks-d...</a>|`|eCNrkHqiaa	start with simple tricks like sit and lie down and then go on to harder tricks and use treats|`|lKFNC2Waaa	you need to be patient.|`|AA11101806	be patient.  some dogs learn slowly.<br>  <br>  other dogs will just do stupid things on their own.

They are by no means a *velcro dog*.<br>  <br>  They make great outside dogs. They would much rather protect the yard than be a lounge lizard.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	I had one for years, and the wife "politely" asked me to not let him in the house anymore.

It is a short and stocky dog that grows to be about 20 inches tall and will weigh about 45 pounds when fully grown. It has a double coat. Its undercoat is dense and its top coat is smooth, straight and compact which makes it water resistant. The common health problems that affect this breed include deafness, eye problems, and hip dysplasia.<br>  <br>  Characteristics, behavior and training of the Australian Cattle Dog<br>  <br>  This breed is very protective and bold. They make a great family dog, however, they tend to be aggressive towards strange children. This is because they may interpret the games that children play as a potential threat to their herd, their family. They are also suitable to use as watch dogs, guard dogs, and working dogs.<br>  <br>  Routine health care and grooming for the Australian Cattle Dog<br>  <br>  To care for this breed you will need to brush their fur coat once a week. Make sure that you remove any debris from their coat when you find it to avoid potential skin problems. They are an active breed that need vigorous exercise at least twice a day. Their temperament can be a bit stubborn at times so you will need to train this dog to be obedient, because it is not going to come naturally to this dog. If cared for properly this breed should live between 12 and 15 years.|`|FdcWPp48aa	They are very smart.  If you decide to get one, you will need to work diligently on training and socialization.  They can be aloof with strangers.  They may also nip at the heels of children (herding) as children move quickly and may cause the dog to want to herd them.  I had a mix Blue Heeler and Australian Shepherd when I was growing up and it was the smartest dog ever.  Oh and they shed profusely.  I have heard this from other people who own them as well.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Australian Cattle Dog has common names: Australian Heeler, Blue Heeler, Queensland Heeler, or Halls Heeler. The heeler moniker comes from the fact that the dogs were bred to herd cattle by nipping at their heels.

NAGiNKFWaa	NO RESPONSIBLE BREEDER/POUND/SHELTER WILL GIVE YOU A PUPPY WITH SMALL CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE, IT IS JUST TOOOOOOO CRUEL.  PLEASE GIVE THIS PUPPY AWAY.

THE BABY DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TREAT A PUPPY KINDLY, AND A BABY DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BABIES TOYS AND PUPPIES TOYS.  YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO TRAIN A PUPPY AND CARE FOR TWO SMALL CHILDREN. PLEASE GIVE THIS PUPPY AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO CARE FOR IT AND YOUR CHILDREN.

The kids need to be taught how to act properly, how to treat animals. It's not the dog's fault the kid is bugging him. Train the kid to be good, reprimand him when he terrorizes the dog. One day he'll harass someone else's dog and he'll get nailed in the face.. Your own dog is likely to get sick and tired of all that and bite him. If you are serious and can't train the kid.. I would find a good home for the kid.. He needs guidance and rules.|`|DU0F48B3aa	Your son should only be told once he needs to be taught how to treat any animal<br>  why is the dog put up he isn't doing anything<br>  I guess you would remove all electric outlets if you son kept trying to stick things in them <br>  Your son need to be taugth what is right and wrong;<br>  why punish the dog<br>  if he hits or torments your daughter do you put her in her crib because she is the distraction??? Probably not but he's taught what is allowed <br>  Same with the dog....|`|4YzQdL2Gaa	the SON!|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I think you need to teach your son manners!  A two year old is old a toddler, not an infant, and is old enough to start learning the difference between right and wrong.  Your child is being rude and if the dog were to bite him it would be a well deserved bite.  The dog is not "causing a distraction" for your son (how the Hell is the dog causing a distraction when he's sleeping?!), your son is being ill behaved.  The poor dog doesn't deserve to be punished for your son's bad behavior.  From what you describe the dog isn't doing anything wrong here, he's simply existing in the same physical space as your son, your son needs to learn how to behave appropriately around the dog.  This isn't about putting the dog "up on a pedestal" or making the kids "tip toe around him."  It's about teaching your children how to behave appropriately around dogs (because I guarantee you that other dogs are not going to be as tolerant as yours is and WILL bit a child for this sort of behavior) and teaching them what the rules of the house are.<br>  <br>  I don't necessarily agree with your husband that the boy only needs to be told once, especially since it is clear that you are not big on enforcing the rules ("be nice to the dog bc u love him?" please, that's not going to do anything for your two year old, kids don't learn empathy until they are about 6 years old).  After all, he is a two year old and he is going to forget the rules.  But if he's ever going to learn the rules then YOU need to provide the consequences (be it a spanking or a time out or whatever) after the first time he doesn't listen.  Otherwise you're teaching your son that he doesn't have to listen to you because he can get away with whatever he's doing for longer by ignoring you.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	It's not the dog's fault that your son can't treat the dog with respect. It's your job as a parent to teach him that if he abuses dogs, they will BITE him. That's not putting the dog on a pedestal, it's respecting the dog. If your child can't respect the dog, then the CHILD should go to his room. Not the other way around.<br>  <br>  Imagine if he started doing this to other dogs he encounters in the street or friend's house. Not every dog is going to be this tolerant. Teach him how to treat a dog respectfully or he is going to get hurt.|`|CZQU0kMBaa	This is the problem with todays kids.  You have to teach your kid to respect all things.  If you don't, he will grow up to be a self-centered brat!|`|7XGjs8cyaa	Tell him " i talked to ____ and he said next time you hurt him He wont forgive you and he'll bite you" Also if he asks just tell him _____ only talks to you. =]|`|K9n9DVEuaa	Your child is young. It's not exactly full their fault. When I was little, I had 2 dogs that I LOVED very much and I'd see my grandma with her dog often. I would try to ride my grandma's dog which is a lil york which was aweful and i'd run around scaring him. But when we got older, we became more friends. I did the same to my rotweiler and dalmation but they didn't care since I was their "puppy" in their eyes and let me do just about anything to them.<br>  I would watch them both together and when he chases the dog, warn him about dog's biting back. When they are together, "babysit" them all at once so you can catch him in the act.<br>  instead of letting him taunt the dog, give your 2 year old a few dog treats and tell him to teach the dog some tricks and show him like sit. Tell the dog to sit and give him a treat and soon the your 2 year old will instead of taunting, probably feed your dog treats. :)|`|Wqhnkd0Saa	There is no way that you can expect a 2y/o to understand what he is doing.  I think that if he's reacting this way around the dog, the dog needs to be outside or given to someone else.  I also have a 2y/o son, but our dogs are outdoor dogs (who are my mother in law's, she lives with us but she's on vacation at her ranch), and it's taken like 3 months, but he finally kind of ignores them now.  And if he does bother them, they run for cover under our van so he can't get them.|`|iMprUF5Vaa	The dog shouldn't have to suffer for what the kids are doing, but the kids shouldn't have to worship the dog. Whenever the dog is in the room with your kids, just keep a close eye on them, or stay present. Scold the kids for bad behavior aimed towards to the dog. You also could buy some dog toys for the 2 year old to throw for or play with with the dog. The dog shouldn't have to be in a kennel or outside whenever the kids are in the room though, and that's not fair to the kids either because they probably just don't know how to play with the dog. Try reading some dog care books to them, and playing with the dog yourself to show them what's acceptable and what's not. If the kids keep teasing him though, he might start to often be grouchy, and possibly start growling at or running away from the kids.

She'll do this nudge - hold it there - move and I end up with a mouth full of Ragamuffin fluffiness LOL<br>  <br>  Years ago I had to have sinus surgery and at the time had a cat that loved to head butt.  I actually ending up borrowing my brother's hockey goalie mask (seriously LOL) to wear in bed the first few days after surgery because he kept trying to butt my nose and it KILLED LOL  Maybe you could get a goalie mask? ;)  Just don't go outside in it or they might think Jason's back - again.|`|zHmZkMStaa	It's a sign of affection - my cat does the same thing.

So if stroking him doesn't work then Idon't know what will.<br>  Cats also think then 'own' people so he is marking his teritory saying that you belong to him but in an affectionate way.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|zv8QaMe1aa	All the cat-owned humans I know refer to this as "head bonking"... it's not meant to cause pain, it's a sign of affection.... if she's doing it too roughly, you may just want to shift your head backward away from her's a bit and say "careful".... my big guy gets a bit over-zealous with the head-bonking sometimes and doing that reminds him to be more gentle.... personally, I love the head bonk..... a kitty that gives you the head bonk seriously loves you..... if she ever follows a head bonk by tucking her head under your chin she's telling you not only are you her's.... but she's yours too.....   If YOU follow the head bonk with a little kiss on the top of her head (a "noggin smooch").... you'll probably send her into pure bliss.  If she's getting you in the middle of the face, try redirecting her head to the side of your jaw.... not as uncomfortable for you, but she still gets to express her love and devotion.|`|9OPoLvm7aa	cat's do that when they like and trust you. <br>  It's similar to when they rub up against your legs<br>  when you're standing.<br>  <br>  My friend had a cat that I head butted<br>  every morning to say hello<br>  before going to school.<br>  <br>  But the cat I knew didn't head butt so hard <br>  that I would get a bloody nose...<br>  so I'm not really sure what to do about it<br>  or how to get her to stop.|`|UlOKMInqaa	Cats headbutt each other to show affection.

Its a bit like when you love someone so much a peck on the cheek is not enough, a big wet kiss is better.<br>  My late male cat used to headbutt me hard too and he knocked our other late female cat off her feet almost lol. <br>   <br>  It your own fault, your cats just loves you so much, you are a very lucky man.

You will have to talk to local vets to see if you could also do a payment plan with the vets.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	no. go to the vet! she really needs to be spayed soon. this is actually keeping her in discomfort. its the better and healthier chose for her to get spayed.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Nope, just get her spayed asap.  And keep her inside and away from any unneutered male.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	She will keep going from one heat period right into another until she is spayed. There is nothing that can be done to stop that
RN1wGlWWaa	I'd check out local shelters to look for that special kitten.  It really doesn't matter if you pick a male or female as long as they are spayed/neutered by 3-4 months old.<br>  <br>  You will need;<br>  <br>  Litter, litter pan, scooper<br>  Food and water bowls (separate) in ceramic or stainless steel - not plastic.<br>  Good tall scratching post (minimum of 4 feet high)<br>  Nail clippers and a comb for grooming<br>  Cat toys<br>  Quality food in both canned and dry (Wellness, Innova, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup, or Royal Canin)<br>  Pet carrier for transport<br>  Cat bed (optional)|`|0zriLTZXaa	You should keep a litter box around. I also have a small house and i have 3 cats. I have i that is 8 months old, 3years old and 9 years old. The kitten is a handful though. Make sure you have enough cat food to feed your kitten because if you dont, your kitten will meow all night.|`|19MdPoaAaa	hi i foster cats and kittens for a local charity, firstly a little kitten doesn't stay little for long! they dont need as much space as a dog but cats still need a fare bit of space, firstly space for a litter box, a bed and a scratching post that is at least as tall as the cat is when stood  on 2 legs. it is also not very good for a cat to have the food and water bowls too close to the litter box as this can easily spread germs and bacteria. as for a certain type of kitten or not, being a fosterer, i can only say a rescued one. you are just about to enter "kitten season" where hundreds of kittens will be aboundon at rescue centers because they are from unwanted litters. if this is your first time owning a cat going to a rescue center will be the best option for you as the staff will be able to go over everything with you from making sure your house is big enough to using the right type of cat litter. they will also help make sure you get a kitten that will suit your personality and life style. <br>  <br>  owning a kitten and watching it grow is very rewarding, but make sure you are prepared for the commitment. it is not unheard of for a cat to live in excess of 20 years. my last kitty that i had sadly died recently at 23years old! <br>  <br>  if you still want to get a kitten, and decided not to go to a rescue center, make sure you insist on seeing the kitten with its mother. if the kitten, its mother or any of its littermates looks ill, has discharge coming from its eyes or nose, do not buy from that breeder, do not take the kitten purely because you feel sorry for it as this will only create room for another kitten to go through the same fate. kittens that are sold with these types of problems ofter are very sick kittys and frequently die very young, <br>  <br>  good luck kittens are great fun<br>  x|`|G5bKiDnFaa	I have a small house and kept a kitten which had to be rescued out of my wall cavity.The mother brought him into a hole in my roof and he fell down into my wall cavity. You will need to get a litter box and kitty litter, when mine was still young we used a plastic filing tray with no end,so it was easier for him.It took me time to get used to a cat because we had a dog before that.I have kept him as an inside cat and don't think he suffers at not being outside.When he was about 5 months old had him desexed otherwise he would have given us a lot of trouble wanting to get outside for females etc.For awhile fed him kitten food from the supermarket then gave him some chicken and tuna to try. Also gave him some kitten milk which he enjoyed at first,but now loves drinking water. He is spoilt i know. I hope this doesn't put you off but mine would run out at me and give me kitten slippers(grab me round my ankles) I was covered with scratches at first. It has got a lot better now that he has got bigger, but he still tries it now and again. I have been firm with him with it and gave him a little smack on his nose, that is if he doesn't try to scratch me. I wasn't sure whether I had made the right decision to keep him, but he is lovable and very intelligent and wouldn't be without him now.
Rw7gi86Naa	If you can pick up a stray, s/he trusts you. When a cat rolls over and exposes its stomach to you, that's a sign of trust. Cats will stay alert around new people, so if the cat relaxes and closes its eyes, that is also a sign of trust, (even more if s/he falls asleep in your presence. I think a great sign of trust is when they allow you to clip their claws; you must trust each other to do that.|`|FfSEhCARaa	My boyfriends cat started to roll over and let me pet her tummy when she decided she trusted and liked me. <br>  Constantly following you around, sitting with you for hours, waits for you to come home, etc|`|uaHzhUeoaa	Something my cat did is she sort of developed this thing she does where she knows how I'm feeling. Like even if my door is closed and she's outside and I'm crying silently, I'll hear her scratching to come in, which she doesn't normally do. Or she could be on the other side of the house and come running if I start to cry. Don't even have to call her. And she doesn't ask for food or anything in these situations like she normally does. :) She just sits with me. :3|`|ty7oMz4Xaa	cats are fickle animals but if they trust you they will feel comfortable enough to expose their tummy to you. although they might bite you if you rub it lol. also falling asleep in your lap is another sign of trust.
FOgyHNM5aa	I would just like to reword your question. <br>  <br>  'why are humans considered by SOME people to be more important than non-human animals?'<br>  <br>  the answer? the bible! The bible says that man has dominion over animals and that's where it has come from. Also many humans do not think that animals have real feelings, feel pain and pleasure as much as we do. Also they want to have their cake and eat it too. They enjoy their steak so much that they tell themselves animals do not matter. Many people also believe that humans are at the top of the food chain which entitles them to be as vicious and cruel as they like. Its the natural order of things, life is cruel anyway, animals kill other animals, its normal - apparently.<br>  <br>  Edit for DJ Paul Above me<br>  <br>  Top predator? I'm sure a bear or a lion could totally kick your ***! and many other animals are more intelligent than most humans! You cannot class humans as a whole, or non human animals as a whole. We are all different with different levels of intelligence. I'm sure you wouldn't disagree if i said Einstein was more intelligent than the average 3 month old baby human being - does this give him the right to do as he pleases with it? Think about that.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	I doubt it's just us humans. I'd be willing to bet most if not all animals would consider themselves to be more important than any other type of animal.<br>  <br>  I dunno if they can think that hard, but, if they can, I bet that's what they're thinking.|`|ftIUXfK7aa	Only other humans consider us to be more important. I'm sure a sloth living deep in a rain forest couldn't give a rats a**e about humans, and don't consider us important at all. <br>  <br>  It's all about perspectives...|`|pPp2FfDVaa	Have you asked your cat or your dog?  Or is it because humans are the ones doing the considering!|`|cbp7Gukbaa	We are not more important we are just the top predator on earth and we have the highest intelligence|`|rQlzfHqraa	I believe your comment that animals are not as civilized is backwards. Animals always act as per their species. A lion is always a lion and a lamb is always a lamb. If human one can never be certain what the action will be. Civilized implies proper behavior and too many humans fall short. We have the most advanced brain and it is should be used with common sense. The animals have the common sense and we are down breeding ourselves and loosing it. Civil peoples would take the very best care of the earth and all it's inhabitants and again we fall short. Even our elderly are selfishly kept alive to suffer a painful existence. This is not civilized.
0uqsaxEqaa	A loud noise such as clapping, and/or a specific (loud!) word - either NO! or OFF! would be best, but be consistent in what you use, and be firm (trilling "oh, Fluffy don't do that" never taught any animal anything except that they can get away with whatever it was!). Timing, too, is everything, so something like pennies in a can, whilst they would be extremely effective, are no use if they are on the other side of the room when you need them! You need to get your correction command in within about 3 seconds of the misdemenor or it isn't really worth the effort.<br>  <br>  Watch your cat and you will learn to see the signs of when she is going to jump up, and get your command in as soon as she starts. Or as soon as you hear the creak/thump of her hitting the desk top...<br>  <br>  Don't let her climb up onto your knee and then onto the desk when you are using it either as that will just send mixed signals. She's not allowed there, for any reason, ever :)<br>  <br>  It rather does depend on the cat, but you may not be able to stop her completely. I had an ex-feral cat once who knew perfectly well she wasn't allowed on the kitchen bench, but it never stopped her if everyone was out of the room and she thought she might find something worthwhile. <br>  <br>  Anyway, best of luck!|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Making loud noises has worked for all my cats.  LOUD noises - shouting, clapping hands, shaking a tin can full of pennies, growling.  Also, move towards the cat as you do it.<br>  <br>  Loud noises scare the pants off of them, and seems to be very effective in convincing them that they don't want to go up there if it means loud noises.|`|0zriLTZXaa	Try locking her out of the room.|`|UZfLLFDBaa	You could try making a loud noise when she does it, like pennies in a soda can. If you are going to spray her, don't do it into her face and do it from a distance so hopefully she won't realize it is you. Eventually she should associate jumping up onto the desk with the unpleasant event and stop. You could also try double sided tape, put it along the edge and when she jumps up she wont like the feel of it. Hope this helps.|`|RfAh74uzaa	There is a mat you can buy at canadian tire for like 15 dollars, its really flat but has little wires all around it underneath the layer of plastic, it gives them a little static shock ( a small one, that wont hurt ur cat) but good enough to train them.|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	Well....<br>  Anything I can think of to stop could result in him biting you..which isn't cool. Aggression in cats isn't normal, I would focus on that. Have you considered that a studio apartment is not the right environment for a breed such as, the bengal? If you try other techniques that will result in a spray or any kind of threat, you will get hurt. How well does your cat know her name? Have you tried sternly yelling at her with her name? I have one cat that responds to his name, not a NO. I would continue attempting verbal communication, until you can figure out where that kittys aggression is coming from. <br>  I wouldn't show her your fear, in a studio apartment she will learn how to use you to her advantage. Just be strong and remember that she is the cat, and you are the master LOL. <br>  Good Luck

The initial adoption fee is more than that of what a county shelter charges, but if you add surgery and shots to that fee, that HATS ee is cheaper<br>  <br>  look on www.petfinder.com  and the pet's profile will specify whether or not it has already been fixed.<br>  <br>  If you get one directly from a Back Yard Breeder, they will only keep breeding the dogs.  So that one won't end up in a shelter, but the entire litter from the next breeding might end up in there in the future.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unless you want a full bread dog for a special reason, get one from a shelter.
3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	Yes you can but it will cost you thousands of dollars, i just seen it on the news a couple weeks ago some lady had her golden retriever cloned, I thought it was over a 100,000 to have it done? I know it was a real high amount more then i would ever be willing to pay or afford for that matter. I thought she had gotten a hold of some scientists that were messing around with the idea and they did it for her, they showed the pup on tv so obviously it happened.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Yes, a private individual can get a dog cloned.  However, it costs literally billions of dollars and it can be difficult to find a lab that will do it.  Really it begs the question "why bother?"  The cloned dog is not going to be the same as your old dog.  The cloned dog will have a different personality shaped by the different experiences the dog has had growing up.  All cloning does is copy the genetic information.  A clone is genetically identical to the original, but personality is shaped by genetics AND environment so the clone will NEVER be exactly the same as the original animal.  Also, cloning has not been "perfected" as a science and clones tend to have significantly shortened life spans.  You'd be better off just grieving your pet and getting a new dog after s/he passes.  And if you do happen to have billions of dollars just laying around I'm sure you could think of many MUCH better ways to spend them...such as supporting a charity.|`|vGiXqViXaa	No only scientist clone right now but if you were to it would cost billions.|`|GaL66jbQaa	No not yet dogs are the hardest animals to clone because the ova don't mature until they are in the womb unlike other mammals whose ova mature in the ovaries. It makes it very hard to harvest suitable eggs. There is a company that stores pets' genetic material so that they can be cloned down the road.  Just remember even if you clone your dog it is not necessarily going to be like your old dog because personality is a function of genetics and experiences.If your cloned dog does not have the same socialization, training or something traumatizes it it will be a different dog.  There are companies that claim to be able to clone dogs for a whole lot of money but their research has not been reviewed by other scientists outside of their countries and they seem unwilling to allow peer review of their practices and research which makes me very skeptical.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Yes, there is a company that clones dogs and cats. And yes, it costs a lot of money.<br>  <br>  Something to keep in mind with cloning is that cloned animals can have health problems and even die prematurely. Also, instead of spending so much money to "bring back" your pet (who you will end up losing again in a few years) why not adopt one of the millions of unwanted dogs at shelters?|`|ApSzd48oaa	i don't think they are cloning dogs yet but it would cost millions and when they do it would probably only in a america|`|XUZ17OOraa	you can <br>  but not like in SCI-FIs when they put a dog into a machine and 2 come out . lol<br>  it was the news ( sky news ) a few weeks ago , an american couple whose dog died last year are paying ( im probably wrong with this figure but ) $150,000 and sending the ashes to a Hong-Kong based company who do something with the ashes and put it into another dog of the same breed and when it gives birth they get to keep the puppy that was made from the ashes of their old dog but the new one will only look like the old one !! it wont have the same personality or memories so its probably not worth it !!<br>  you could probably find the whole story on the web somewheres <br>  :D :D|`|Cg5FJVd9aa	noo, it is not possible. unless your mom is enistein.. i doubt itt :)<br>  <br>  hope i helpedd!!!<br>  <br>  --kaylynn<br>  (bestt answerr please??)|`|K7Y8x3Xdaa	here is the story about the people that did it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28892792/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28892792/</a>|`|AxaspNJJaa	No you can't clone your dog|`|OE1nchCqaa	Yes, I heard all over the new the someone cloned there dog when it died but it cost thousands of dollars.
P9byozx9aa	Ok so there are a few possibilities, I recomend mini rexes and/or netherland dwarfs to people. I love showing them. I've been breeding them for 9 years and I love it,They are so loveydovey and small enough to keep in a small cage and they're easy to litter box train so if you want to let it run around the house you can.|`|2CHsVUr3aa	Personally I love Lion Heads but they aren't yet recognized by the ARBA so it all depends on whether you like BOS or just BOB..

They have a nice bubbly personality, and love people.|`|hoOygDw1aa	I highly reccommend the Polish breed if you're looking for a good personality and ease of showing.<br>  <br>  Polish are a small breed (about 2.5 lbs.), and have a compact body type. They're a very easy rabbit to breed and show and are highly reccommended for young children or those who are new to the show world.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a lop, as much as I love Hollands, I would suggest Mini Lops. Hollands and Minis both have fantastic personalities overall, but Mini Lops are much easier to find good type on and are again easier to breed and show.|`|ikTT4GkHaa	I have a what i think is either a new zealand white or a ruby eyed white, Uoof, and he's pretty sweet and friend and pretty laid back<br>  while my little trouble maker hotot, Thymine Destiny Mik, is  a hyper little bunny who gets a tad agressive and doesn't like to be hold<br>  So in my view bunnies with droopy ears are more laid back and easy to teach and hold rather than the short ears stick up ones :]|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	Miniature lops!

SdwG2rzXaa	although your puppy may not like it, the best thing to do might be to have her sleep inher cage until she gets used to it and no longer barks through the night. if it keeps you up try putting the cage in a seperate room. Once she sleeps in the cage you only have to let her out when you feel she should get up. Then your puppy will hopefully realize she should sleep till she is allowed out.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Our don't understand weekends either, or day light savings time.

20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Yes but unless your tap water is from a well and smells like sulpher or is contaminated  ,it is unnecessary. Much of the bottled water is from a city domestic supply . They filter it and bottle it. The federal government has revealed this in several reports. Check your bottle labels.<br>  <br>  I have given my birds water straight from the tap for over 50 years and never had a problem. Also checked with several bird experts and they all say tap water that comes from a city supply and is safe for human consumption is safe for the birds. What prompted this investigation was a remark that the chlorine killed the good bacteria in birds. This prompted an uproar on a chat where I am a mod And one man called up several nationally known experts who promptly reassured us tap water was OK. So save your money.|`|lMSAyTm6aa	If you have hard water it's better to give water from the tap because it has minerals in it.

Have you somewhere to wash it in your apartment?<br>  <br>  Can you carry it downstairs to a FENCED GARDEN for its last pees and poos before you go to bed? Then what do you do when it wants a pee in the middle of the night? Is it safe for you to take it out during the night? Will you mind going out in your nightwear? <br>  <br>  When your dog wakes up in the morning, it will not cross it legs until you get dressed. Will you again take it downstairs for a pee?  In all of this consider the fact that if you are not at home during the day to potty/housetrain your dog it will pee and poo on the carpets.<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard a dog cry when it is left alone? If you are at work you will be unaware of this, have you considered the other tenants or your dog? They will almost certainly complain, then what. Eventually you may be asked to vacate your apartment and make good the damage before you leave. Have you considered how many landlords will take you and a dog? <br>  <br>  Dogs are dumped every day because their owners cannot find accommodation.

My fave dog breed: A Havanese|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	First and foremost do you have time for a dog? You can't depend on your father to have time for it if you don't. If you have the time and are willing to put in the time it takes to have a dog then show your father how responsible you are and that you would be responsible enough to have a dog. There is also vet costs so is your father willing to pay those? That can get very expensive specially if the dog needs surgery. Also there is other costs such as food and toys and chew bones and nail clippers and brushes and shampoos, food & water bowls,collar, leash, tick collars or ointments for bugs. All that adds up its not cheap owning a dog, then you have to be responsible enough to make sure it has food and fresh water every day, potty trained and obedience trained that all takes time and a lot of effort, and you have to make sure it gets walked at least three times every day as well.<br>   Also does this apartment allow dogs? specially a larger breed dog? a lot of apartments don't allow dogs at all. Also larger breeds need more exercise then smaller breeds do and shouldn't live in apartments they should have big fenced in back yards they can go out and run in if not live out in the country.<br>   My favorite breed is the Papillon i own two of them plus a Pomeranian i have had large breed dogs as well one Rottweiler , a Lab cross and a German shepard/ Rottweiler cross,they took a lot more work then my smaller breeds did.

It took me a while to persuade my mum, 9 years! But explain to your dad that you are responsible. Discuss who will walk it and care for ect because they are very tiring and hard to look after.<br>  If you have a friend who has a dog or neighbour, look after it for a while, you could also try fostering. This will get you and your dad used to having a dog in the house and to see whether you are ready for one.<br>  Research breeds and find one that is best to suit your life. When you have selecteda breed, speak to breeders, owners, visit the breed, but only get a dog when you bbelieveyour ready and able to look after one, an older dog could be a good idea but whatever suits you.<br>  Hope this helps<br>  And my favourite breed is the Field bred English Springer Spaniel, joined favourite with the Welsh Springer and the Weimaraner

g6sNQ7p1aa	I'm sorry that everyone keeps telling you that you should get a sun conure! For crying out loud people, she gave you the 3 choices to pick from!!!<br>  <br>  ANYWAYS... :) I breed green cheek conures and they are fantastic little birds. While I have never owned a maroon belly or a crimson belly, I can tell you that green cheeks and maroon bellies are from the same place in the wild and therefore act more alike than the crimson belly (who is relatively new to aviculture and is still a little unknown). You are going to end up paying a LOT more for a crimson though because they are pretty rare (unless you've got the hookups with a breeder). Green cheeks come in some beautiful mutations and are all of the qualities you have listed. Maroon bellies are only one color (green primarily with some red), but their personalities are the same. From some of my breeder friends, I have heard that crimson bellies are somewhat "heavier" and larger than green cheeks and have slightly different personalities. You can visit my website at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://eevcjen.tripod.com" rel="nofollow">http://eevcjen.tripod.com</a> if you'd like to see some beautiful mutations of green cheeks and a much more detailed description about them. Every bird has a down side, but they're worth it if you're up for it.<br>  <br>  And, just like that other person said, don't buy the first bird you see... You have to feel 100% sure that it's the bird you want, personality and all! :) Good luck!|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	They are all pyrrhuras and essentially the same bird. Pick the one you like best or let the bird pick you.|`|ec1d80b5105e09c381fb6e0b627016c2aa	I've got a nanday and also considered a sun so i can't really help u.  But i have heard and have read in at least four different conure books that those are all about the same.  So which ever type you can find first and that takes to you.  Try looking at some bird rescues or at breeders and go see the different birds.  U'll prolly find one that's tame and seems to like u.  Conures are very much parrots in the sense that they have very strong feelings about the types of people they like.  I got my nanday for me and he bonded with my husband.  We are working so that he likes me more, but he is completely my hubby's bird, just don't buy the very first u see and be leary of pet store birds.  If ur wanting a bird to be a pet and fun to handle u should really get a handraised bird.  And any bird u go see should at least know the step up (either on a stick or hand) and be comfortable sitting on a hand.  It can take forever to tame an older bird raised conure.  My bird was handfed and while he was at the petstore didn't really like hands in or near his house but i could tell in the store he could be handled, would go on a stick and would sit on my hand without biting or being scared so i knew he would tame down in a home situtation.|`|UvPUopA8aa	Green cheeks! I'm a bit biased cause I own one. But I've found that when you put the time into them they can be all of those things. Green cheeks are also probably the most readily available of those three.

1868dc03c33039f8ae0fe4351eda6159aa	No, this food isn't the best.  You need to feed a food that specifically says for "large breed" puppies.  This will have a better nutrient ratio to keep her from growing too fast.  If you feed her food that is not balanced properly, you risk joint and bone issues from her growing too fast.  <br>  <br>  You can feed ANY dog food to ANY dog, but it doesn't mean that it is the best food for the dog.  The package will list feeding recommendations for all sizes.  <br>  <br>  We can't tell anything about her weight or size based on measurements.  You need to see the dog in order to see if she is the right weight, etc.  Your vet should be able to counsel you on this issue.|`|KUZ2ubyGaa	i actually just got a german sheperd mix yesterday! she 12 weeks old and i love her to death already! you should be feeding your dog a food that is specifically for puppy big dog breeds. if you just go to the local supermarket im sure you will be able to find it. hope i helped!

EJpiaCMQaa	Your budgie is picking his feathers for a variety of reasons.  It may be due to hormones, stress, boredom, parasites, an unhealthy diet, or some type of bacterial or fungal infection of the skin.  <br>  <br>  Some ways you can help with this problem is to change around the perches or toys in the bird's cage to keep it from being bored.  In addition, you can either bathe or mist the budgie on a daily basis.  This will encourage your budgie to preen itself rather than pull out its feathers.  Make sure the bird is eating a well-balanced diet, with lots of fruits and vegetables.  Also, make sure its eating enough of its cuttlebone or mineral block for calcium.  <br>  <br>  If these things I suggested don't work after a certain period of time, you may want to take the bird for a vet exam.  That way you can be certain it doesn't have a bacterial or fungal infection or any other illness that may be causing the feather plucking.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to ask questions.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	As you have introduced a new bird to your original bird - you may like to check for mites or parasites on the birds. If you are not sure how to this - take then both off to the vets for a check.<br>  <br>  Sometimes bids get stressed, and will act strangley, they may become agitated - pacing, bobbing or scratching and picking at themselves.<br>  <br>  Also you could try a bit of shell grit - you can buy this from your local pet shop. <br>  <br>  Check with your vet - but keep being friendly with your birds, talk to them and let them see you often.|`|fkbRC8eEaa	The feather plucking is a sign of boredom<br>  You should get your birds some new toys to play with that would be good fun from them and would probably distract them from the feather plucking!

I don't see the problem here.<br>  <br>  But if you've just had her spayed, she's probably looking for comfort and reassurance while she's healing..... so probably about a month until she feels well.... but if she's sensing your not wanting her near that's probably adding to her need for reassurance at this point.... so what's your problem anyway?  Seriously, if I'm home sitting on my sofa, chances are there's a cat in my lap.... it's one of the joys of sitting on my own sofa, instead of someone else's.... and in bed I usually have one curled up next to me and one next to my feet..... don't see why that would be an issue.

qChv1Bymaa	Potty Training - Send your dog outside every 3 hours and after meals. (its hard work but it pays off later) everytime your dog does a wee or poo outside treat it and say 'good boy/girl' <br>  <br>  Walking - You could start walking your dog now, but before you go out into the streets/parks let your dog get used to walking on the lead but walking him/her around the house or garden.<br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|yEnWdKfqaa	Your dog is old enough to start training. It is actually preferred that you start training your dog at a young age. You have to be patient while potty training because she is so young. Try using potty pads at first while potty training. Be careful while walking her because she is susceptible to diseases since she has not had her full set of shots. Good luck with your new pup!<br>  <br>  Also, take your pup out after a nap, 30 min after eating, and if you crate train, immediately take her out when you let her out of her crate. Do not wait 3 hours like the other person said.

But I have failed to find any advice on a less than perfect situation.  3 days ago, our family adopted a 12 week old Pointer.  The first night she stayed in our spare bathroom, which was a last resort due to the late hours spent at the humane society.  The second day we got a crate and spent some time introducing her to it.  She seems really resistant to it.  No matter what I try to coax her with, treats, toys or meals, she will only go half way in.  Nightime came and I had no choice but to put her in and let her whine and cry.  Today we have been working on some more "fun time" and "new treats."  Things seem to be getting easier, but am I ruining it for her by having her sleep in the crate over night before she is completely in love with the idea? Whining is expected to a certain degree right? This should subside after a few days and more practice or so right?<br>  <br>  I also know that if she soils her crate overnight then I have to adjust my schedule accordingly, but if she soils am I ruining the whole thing? My husband and I are working on a schedule that we can share the responsibility around his work schedule, and she soiled her crate last night(the first crate night). I did not punish her, I just cleaned it up with a watered down vinegar solution.<br>  <br>  Other than that things are going great, I am a stay at home mom and I have the time it takes to let her out every 45mins and feed her on a schedule...In 3 days we have had one floor accident, and it was my fault, I was on the phone and lost track of time. I love this little puppy!! Thanks for your time!
Cfk1kr8Daa	You could get your friends together, and arrange a fundraiser dog walk.  Speak to the volunteer coordinator of the shelter, and have them ask for permission in a park, or they could even have it start and end at the shelter.<br>  <br>    You can ask for donations of stuff from various businesses to use as prizes, and perhaps get someone to make T-shirts for the event.  Businesses will often donate if the shlter is a registered non-profit, because they can get some of the money back on their taxes.<br>  <br>    But you will find that you can do a lot for free, and a lot of dog people love to go on organized walks.  Put  up a pledge sheet form on the website with the registration - and you can charge a small registration fee for every dog  and human team - and you will find they will do a lot of fundraising for you.<br>  <br>    Have an adult help you coordinate this, and you will really get something going. Kids have a lot of great energy, and you will be surpirsed how much you can get accomplished, but you really need an adult just to help sign forms and siupersvise a little - and you need PERMISSSION from the shelter to do things in their name.<br>  <br>    A lot of shelters find their best source of fundraisers are kids - go for it!!!|`|3giaPYe8aa	Have all the adults get together and have a garage sale.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  From the symptoms you describe, it is difficult to really say that your kitten is sick, but it is good that you are so observant. The food you gave her could possibly have upset her tummy- new type of food- but if she is playing  and eating and drinking normally, it obviously is nothing serious... or she could just be "moody" with other people for the moment. And if you are caring for her, and she is not living with you, you don't know what she may have experienced. She may have been injured, as well. <br>  <br>  So it is a good idea to keep an eye on her, and if other symptoms develop, of course take her in to the vet for an exam.<br>  <br>  But without further details it is really difficult to hazard a guess. If you can handle her easily, check her out for an injury.<br>  <br>  Thanks for taking care of a stray kitty with such concern.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I'm not sure, but at her age and the fact she's outside and sleeping more than normal is her only symptom, I'm kind of thinking she may be pregnant. Cats can have their first heat cycles as early as 4 months old so she's not too young to be able to get pregnant. <br>  <br>   Without a vet exam, it's really impossible to say with any certainty exactly what is going on with her.  I would catch her and bring her to the vet where she can get examined and receive an accurate diagnosis. If she checks out all clear, she can be spayed safely into the 3rd week of pregnancy which would be the best thing for all involved (including the kittens, sadly).|`|4t10YACQaa	maybe she is pregnant.<br>  <br>  I really don't think there is any thing wrong with adopting her.                 at my house we have adopted two stray cats already they have both had babies and are now both fixed so they cant have babies any more.<br>  any way maybe she is pregnant.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Well done for looking after her!  It's difficult to say if there's a real problem.  Try and look for anything like weepy eyes, or loose poos.  It could be just she's growing up and loosing some of her kitten playfulness.  But it is a bit worrying, and I think it might be good to get her checked at the vet.<br>  <br>  Now she's this age you really need to think about getting her spayed.  With her being outside, if you don't you could soon have 30-40 cats to look after instead of just one...  She'll also be at risk of getting lost, getting injured in fights and catching diseases.  If you are going to take her to the vet to get checked, think about getting this done at the same time.  If she hasn't had them, she could do with getting her vaccinations too.<br>  <br>  If money is an issue you could ask some of those shelters if they know of any help you can get.  Even if they are not no-kill shelters, they may be able to help get a cat spayed and so stop a problem with lots more unwanted cats for them to deal with later.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	I'm glad she's found someone to take care of her.... good for you.<br>  <br>  I hate to say it, but at 8 months old, you need to check the kitty house you made her for kittens.....  she could very easily be a new Momma and that would explain her unwillingness to leave her house.  If she's not just given birth, or isn't pregnant, she needs to be spayed SOON, or she will be and you'll have kittens to deal with.  There may be a rescue group in your area that has low or no cost spay/neuter available.... try finding one that can help you with that.

Food allergies is the second most likely cause, and a cat with an allergy can't help itself until it gets the problem under control.  We found one of ours was allergic to the preservatives in most dry foods, not to a food item in it. Putting him on a raw diet helped a LOT within just a week's time.  Have you treid this?  Did the vets even suggest it?  So many vets are dog vets and not cat vets, they don't give the owners the options they should know about.<br>  <br>  The peeing is separate from the allergic reactions.  If you have had the cat checked for urinary infections (yes, they do get them and they have pain when they pee so they think the box causes this) and this was the base cause, it will only clear up with antibiotics.  It's a week's treatment but it solves the problem.  You can't blame the cat for a medical condition that you won't treat.  (This is assuming you didn't scare the cat out of the litter box, change litters for something with heavy perfumes to cover odors, have a dirty box, or other pets that attack the cat while it's trying to use the box so it would now avoid it).<br>  <br>  Personally, if you can't help the cat, find an owner who can.  There are feline rescues in every area of the country.  Make sure to transfer the cat's medical records with the cat, so the new owner has the basics to fall back on.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	Get a new vet!|`|TYyZwOtlaa	have the vets every mentioned to you about doing allergy tests? they usually take a blood sample and send it off to the lab where they can test it for many different allergies. We use axiom laboratories here in the uk, <a href="http://www.allergyvet.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.allergyvet.co.uk</a>  you may have something similar in your neck of the woods, you could also try emailing them to see if they have a branch where you are.|`|ty7oMz4Xaa	this sounds like a skin allergy to me. i would seek a different vet the one you are going to doesn't sound like they care very much. your cat sounds very sick. if you don't have the means to have more care done for it because of the price you could always contact your local humane society and see if they can help you.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	I guess in the end your options are a shelter (which may not help the cat in the long run), or euthanasia.  If the condition is severe the latter may be the best for the cat, especially if the alternative is a miserable stay in a shelter, failing to get homed, and getting euthanized anyway.  But do look for a no-kill shelter.  Actually just changing environment may be enough to cure your cat's problems.  Not saying it's your fault: but there are so many factors that could cause this!<br>  <br>  I know you say you don't want suggestions to help the cat, but... Sorry in advance if you've tried these suggestions...<br>  <br>  The vet says use Advantage: that suggests fleas.  Have you treated the flat as well as the cat?  Fleas spend most of their time off the cat in furnishings etc and their eggs can last for months.  So you may need to treat the flat (and maybe there is a problem with the house generally).  (Presuming you are in a flat in a house.... but you get the drift.  If it's not your area of the property, there may be fleas in communal areas and other people's areas that are coming into yours).<br>  <br>  Overgrooming might be a possible diagnosis: can be linked to allergies, stress, and urinary tract problems.  Allergies: presumably you've tried wheat free, dairy free, chicken free, additive free... etc. Stress: besides removing source, you could try providing more entertainment/play or a feliway diffuser.  Urinary tract problems should be checked for by the vet. (NB I feel the peeing is linked, and probably has the same root cause as the sores etc).

FaPrr8bbaa	My chi puppy backs out of all her outfits except for the sweater that doesn't come in contact with her armpits. It fits her like a muscle shirt. She will keep it on for days. So I assume that the others irritate her there.  I have a heated throw blanket on one end of my futon covered with a sheet and blanket that she uses when she can't share my body heat.  And she likes going outside naked when she plays as long as it is over 25 degrees but she has other non-chi dogs to inspire her. Good luck|`|AxaspNJJaa	you get her to wear it more often|`|EeTJ1CEHaa	If wearing it more often doesn't do the trick, I would try something that's a pullover that may be more comfortable than a coat. When we first brought our chi home she was too small for even extra small. My husband took one of this wool socks and made holes for her front legs and left it long enough to reach her tail. She loved it and it kept her cuddly warm. You just have to keep playing with the socks to get the holes in the right spot.
54GBWTgoaa	add 5 minutes on to every month, so she's 9 weeks which is just 2 months so she can be walked for 10 minutes, and so on.<br>  you should really stick to this as much as you can as not only is she a large breed which means her bones will be growing at a quick rate, her joints are still very supple and over exercising could really damage her.<br>  By all means take her out for several 10 minutes walks but she must have breaks to nap, even as she gets older, so say when she's 6 months, i would not walk her more than 30 minutes at a time, just make it a fun filled walk, so maybe go to an enclosed, fenced area and play fetch << she's only young and it will really tire her out., good luck!!|`|ApSzd48oaa	you shouldn't walk to much probably a 5 - 10min walk 2 times a day and then let her out in the garden for a bit to wear of some of that energy|`|8eSbCrQraa	Yes, mastiffs are lazy but as adults.  Even mastiff puppies are still puppies and are hyper.  Our mastiff puppy was a ball full of energy until she hit 10 months.  <br>  You do not want to walk them more than 10-15 minutes.  Its extremely important to not over exercise them because of their fast growth.  Once their about a year to year 1/2 you can increase it little by little.  By the time she is 1 1/2 she could be up to 1/2 mile but thats it.|`|Wt61EclRaa	Call the breeder you got her from.  They would be more then happy to discuss all aspects of raising your girl-they would know best.  I hope she came from a reputable breeder as backyard breeders/pet shop dogs can develop MAJOR problems physically.  Is she up to date on all her shots?  Ask your vet also. It's good to establish a good relationship with your vet early on....then they know you and you will feel comfortable calling them when any concerns arise.|`|KOdLWJaQaa	Everyone says a puppy this young is still growing and not to over do it because the bones are growing so much.  I personally think a nice, 30 minute walk, (not run) once or twice(if you want) per day at this age is just fine.  I know my pup needed at least this much.  If people question if this is too much exercise, I would ask your vet.  They can tell you or your breeder (if he/she is a good one).  Good luck and lots of patience!|`|FdcWPp48aa	Mastiff's should only be walked for a short time, though you can play with the pup for as long as the pup would like to play.  You want to be careful not to stress the joints on a growing pup, especially when you are talking about a large breed such as your mastiff.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	An adult Mastiff will be satisfied with a couple of 20- to 30-minute walks daily.

There are some private animal hostels as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
y7H1V39Jaa	Absolutely include the help of trainer or an expert that you trust.  Set your budget, know what you are looking for before you go, and don't get blinded by one or two good things that you know about the horse and forget to consider the whole picture.  When you seek the advice of an expert, listen to him/her, otherwise, you are wasting their time and your money...good luck and just remember, you don't have to bring the first one that you look at home with you.|`|jUjkvis8aa	When you're buying, go with your riding instructor or an experienced friend. Always get the horse vetted, and don't buy the first horse you see. When you go and view the horse, you should always ask the owner questions, such as:<br>  -Is he good to box/shoe/clip e.t.c?<br>  -Does he have any vices?<br>  -What is his medical history?<br>  - Have you competed him?<br>  -Have you always had him or does he have any previous owners I can contact?<br>  -Has he ever bucked or reared?<br>  Word of mouth is a good place to find horses lower down the price scale. Try your riding school, local pony club branch and tack shop. From what you've said, a good horse for you would be 14.2hh+, perhaps a cob or Welshie.<br>  <br>  Good luck with finding your first horse :)<br>  ?<a href="http://www.horsedeals.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsedeals.co.uk/</a><br>  ?<a href="http://www.horsemart.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsemart.co.uk/</a><br>  ?<a href="http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/</a>|`|IWaxUqDzaa	Well, I've got an idea. Since like you said, you can't go out and spend a big wad of cash on a horse right now, what about getting a lease? If you got a half lease, you could still save money while you've got the lease horse and then, when your lease is up you'll have some money saved to buy a horse and you'll never have gone without one! :) Hope I helped!!|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	Go and look at LOTS with someone who really knows horses! Don't buy from an auction. Make sure you see the horse being tacked up. If you can, visit unexpectedly. Get the current owner to ride it first, then ride it yourself. I can't stress too much, make sure it will hack out alone if this is what you want to do, otherwise you will have all sorts of problems!!! Once you have found the one you want, get it vetted before you part with any money. Try and agree a "trial period" with the seller. If they are honest they will often do this. How exciting!

Ensure like people have already said and to ask the basic<br>  <br>  Does he/she or have they ever bolted bucked reared napped<br>  do they hack alone and in company<br>  any previous injurys<br>  what experience have they had jumping, shows etc<br>  Always get them vetted even if you only have a stage 1/2 <br>  Ask if you can have a loan with view to buy<br>  or a trial for several weeks people that are being totally honest are happy to do this, (remember though If you traveled a long way this may not always be possible)<br>  Maybe even a long term loan works wonderfully for me.  I had ￡2000 to spend on a horse but found my perfect partner for long term loan!! and saved some money paid off some debt and had a ball getting some new stuff!!!<br>  <br>  Be honest with your self, you capabilities and your experience and your competence ie if your nervous or confident rider<br>  look at as many as possible<br>  <br>  What do you plan to do, a happy hacker or competition horse?? <br>  and make sure the horse will be happy with what you intent to do with them a bored horse can be problematic and again a horse that is over worked will only be a matter of time before injuries occur<br>  <br>  Ensure that they ride the horse first then your self and then the other person who you take with you (good to see what the horse is like with several different riders)<br>  <br>  And be careful its sad but it happend alot People will try to pull the wool over your eyes, and sell you something that is not true to there word<br>  <br>  But word of mouth is great through mates etc as people are then so honest and happier for trial period i.e 2 weeks or a months<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps Good luck finding your new best friend Its worth all the hard work and hassle in the end<br>  xx|`|USTNDdULaa	hey<br>  ok you need to make a list of requirements, <br>  what age bracket?<br>  how high you want it to be able to jump?<br>  no vices?<br>  price?<br>  what height, i would go for 15hhish?<br>  must be 100% to travel, shoe, clip, catch, rug etc?<br>  etc etc<br>  any horses that meet this criteria are good to try and worth your while<br>   but don't fall for the first horse you try, and if you have any doubts don't get it as this may result in disaster, for a first time buyer you need to contact the owner and ask questions like is it a novice ride and u don't want something u can't control...its just no fun! even though u help out at stables and think your really experienced get a novice ride so you can't go wrong and trust me some not novice rides are uncontrollable and you don't want to be in the same situation that i was in lol. get the owner to ride it first over the flat and jumps this is so u can see how it moves and check that its safe. try to get a horse that you can have on trial for at least 2 weeks or on short term loan before you buy to make sure its as sane as when you tried it and that its defo the right horse for you, this also gives to time to find out if it has any quirks.  <br>  hope i helped and do contact me for more info as i have a list of questions to ask on the phone and in person which might help you.<br>  thanks<br>  good luck|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	You sound exactly like me at 15, haha. 15 is like the best age to get your first horse in my opinion. <br>  <br>  Well some advice...your first horse should always always be a horse with a "been there done that" record. Easily forgiving of mistakes, knows what its doing, preferably in the ages of 7-10.<br>  <br>  You might find the horse you like on this site...<a href="http://www.horses-for-sale-uk.com/classified_horses_for_sale.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.horses-for-sale-uk.com/classi...</a><br>  <br>  many different types of horses, prices, and locations (all in the UK). keep in mind if you have a trianer i would defintaly reccomend for a first time horse purchase to ask your trianer to help you find your "perfect" horse. <br>  <br>  Always insist on riding the horse of course before purchase, more than one time as you know some horse people are pretty sly out there and might drug the horse to make it clam down, lunge the snot out of it, ect.<br>  <br>  After you have decided you like the way that it rides, or you can do this before get a pre purchase exam from a qualified equine vet , they bascially give for what you would for a human a "physcial". You can request a lot other things as well. <br>  <br>  Just don't settle for the first horse you ride, there are so many horses out there make sure it's the one you want!<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope you find the horse you love.|`|qNuynJNLaa	Congrats, your aloud a horse, it must be great =]<br>  <br>  Well somethings you need to know about buying your first horse, you've proberbly figured the process can take a while but it's worth it, one of the most important things about buying a horse is ALWAYS have it vetted, if the owners wont allow this then the horse is most likely unsound and a waste of your money, if they are open to vetting try to get the vet that checks up on the ponies at your riding school, or the vet a friend uses if thats possible.<br>  <br>  When you go to see the horse for the first time your going to want to have a ride to see if you feel comfortable in the saddle and if you like his paces, but NEVER get on the horse until you have seen the owner rider him first, also keep in mind that if a horse goes well for someone else it still may not go so well for you so always wear your hat & if avalible body protecter as a procaution, when your going to ride the horse ask and experienced horse friend/family member of if possible your riding instructor to tell you what they think he goes like and if you and him look ok together, and if they wouldn't mind ask them to ride the horse after you and give you their opinion on his paces ect.<br>  <br>  Always better to be safe than sorry, try not goto an auction to get a horse as this can SOMETIMES cause problems as you don't get a chance to ride the horse, see him properly before you buy and you never know what he could turn out like. Dealers aren't always as bad as some people say, I know a good few who i've bought my BEST horses from, if your going to buy from a dealer, ask for refrences and make sure their prices aren't rediculous for the type of horse it is, also again makesure they ride first.<br>  <br>  If you find a horse you like then ask the owner if you can take him out on loan for atleast 3 weeks to see how he is on the yard he will be stabled, how he is with other horses & msot importantly how you get along, if you take a horse on loan to the yard your using you will see his real side, wether he's really a quiet, calm horse or if he's a high strung, fiesty horse, they don't always seem the same when they're on new yards, he may be perfect where he is but may not when he's been moved yards.<br>  <br>  Lastly remember buying a horse is a big desicion so thinkg carefully as it isn't always something you can change as alot of owners may not take horses back when others will be happy to or you may not be able to afford the upkeep of a horse, makesure you've thought about it really good and are up for the hard work but fun that comes along with it =]|`|ofc3QQUJaa	I found my perfect horse Witch at a horse show. School masters are not always the best never buy from a riding school because they will only sell if there is something wrong with the horse. I had a horse who I brought from one who they sold with wrong tack who had no breaks and I took him out on m first xc course which didn't turn out well. Just look at the papers and at shows and hopefully you will find one soon there should be some good horses because people are going to uni and have to sell their horse. Make sure through that you take the horse out for a hack before buying and not just around a sand school as you want to make sure that he or she is ok out on hacks because some times they are carlm in a school but nuts when outside one. Also make sure that they are good in the stable, athaving their feet picked out being tacked etc. But most importantly that they are right for you and can do what you are planning to do as some horses can be great but not the right horse. You probably need a good size horse that you won't grow out of but will go both slow and then fast adusting to what you can do so that when you are more confident you can do more and not have to get a new horse. As you are 15 you probably need a 15 hand horse with a minimum of 14 hands so that he or she won't be too small for you. Also you should get a cheap horse because of the credit cruch and prehaps get a better one for you budget. <br>  <br>  I am 15 and have a 15.2 but have been riding since I was 4 so its really up to you which height but anything under 15 hands you might have to sell latter on.<br>  <br>  Good luck with finding your horse.
rTaaIXSuaa	Chickens, like most birds, brood (sit on) their clutch of eggs to ensure that they develop properly. If the eggs are not maintained at 99° F for 21 days, they will fail.<br>  <br>  An  incubator will substitute for the warm underside of a hen. The eggs must be maintained at a constant temperature, the humidity must be high, and the eggs must be turned at least three times a day. If the eggs are not turned, the embryo will usually adhere to the wall of the egg, and development will fail. Commercial incubators provide for all these environmental needs. So the answerer above me is wrong by telling you to NOT turn them. It is a must! I have raised chickens for years and it angers me that he would say something like that.<br>  <br>  Another thing I would like to mention is that it seems your coop is not pest proof. You need to make some changes to your coop to keep the rodents out. I had lived in a racoon infested area where I had 35 chickens and the only reason I lost 2 of those 35 was because I had too many cocks. All I needed was one cock for all of them but I had 4 which is way too many. They will start to fight over the hens with the other males and I lost them to that. I have found raccoons hanging around but my coop was way above ground and they couldn't get to them. If your coop is on the ground it is imperative that you place wire fencing around the bottom and have it either held down by rods that go in the ground or really heavy logs or stones. Raccoons and possums are avid diggers so they can always dig to get underneath and claw the bottom or dig enough to make an entrance.|`|rQlzfHqraa	It's time. I certainly hope so! Keep them at 98 degrees F , no turning them and no towel is needed as they should be hatching on the 21st day of incubation. The towel can add the needed moisture at hatching time. Soak it with warm water and keep it close, not touching, to the eggs. As the chicks dry you can move them to a suitable brooder at 95 degrees F.|`|569f9f04f9b83dcf0d1a4893f9c9db51aa	Okay, make sure they're fertilized first. Then, buy an incubator QUICK and find out how hot they should be. If they're not at the right temperature too long, they'll die :(. Good luck though :D. I hope they hatch!|`|CuP846Ezaa	I think when the other person said not to turn them its because the hen was on them for three weeks and they are due to hatch. At day 18 the hen stops turning the egg because the chick inside it is positioning itself to break through the airsack (blunt end of the egg), so after day 18 you don't turn the eggs at all. Good luck with the hatch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Michelle|`|9y878Wc1aa	You should keep them super warm! look up how hot they should be in the mean time try to buy a that device that keeps them warm i foget wats its called an inbincuater? something like that!<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|VHVLYSVlaa	Just make sure to keep the eggs really toasty.  I would say around 100 degrees Farenheit to 110.  They should hatch.  Good Luck!
K0tpQoHRaa	well the first thing that you will need to do is to buy a breeding box from a local pet store.ask in specific for budgie breeding box size.if the hen (female) is her poo would increase dramatically in size, she would become more aggressive,and posibly bite when hands enter cage.she will be territorial and be protective of her nesting erea or breeding box.after mating she will lay her first egg within a few weeks,and lay more every other day.the hatching procces takes 18 to 21 days and one will hatch every other day in order of being layed the mother will feed them for the first couple of weeks then the father (mate) will pitch in and help as well.you will need to keep a close eye to insure that ALL hatchlings are being fed,as you will have to feed ones not being fed as much as others.well that sums it all up hope every thing goes as plans good luck.<br>  <br>  You can also tell if she is preg if the couple are cought succesfully mating, this is when the female lifts her rear feathers as the male gets on top and puts his under her.....<br>  <br>  good luck!!!!|`|WIhaOOeNaa	no parakeets cant get pregnant .....they could lay eggs tho<br>  <br>  even tho they might lay eggs it doesnt mean all of them will hatch or they might not be fertile<br>  <br>  i would put in a next box and see what happenes.<br>  <br>  any other questions e mail me parakeetman24@yahoo.com|`|HhXrcEARaa	It is breeding season right now, so it is possible.

woJzZy2Eaa	good toy for a rabbit is a piece of untreated wood that has been soaked in salt water for a day. It is tasty for them and helps keep their teeth worn down. Also they like those liitle toy balls with the bells in them (cat toys). Just be careful that they don't chew the bells out.|`|fWB8q1dwaa	Apparently they like pinecones, and cardboard boxes. Also they can munch on twigs off apple trees .|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Bunnies also like the hard plastic teething toys and rings that babies use (not exactly home-made and sometimes you know someone or have a neighbor whose baby has outgrown them).<br>  <br>  Our bunnies at the shelter like to tear up and chew on sections of an old phone book.  Most of their toys are commercial - they love wicker baskets and wicker balls to chew on.  The reason we "buy" them is that you have to be careful that anything wicker or wooden is untreated with chemicals.<br>  <br>  You can stuff special treats of green vegetables leaves or some of their hay into toilet paper rolls for them to get out to eat.

They do shiver and it's natural for them to shiver when their down is wet, it helps them dry and fluff back up.  They also look like drowned rats when they are wet.  The first time i saw my bird soaked it scared me because he looked almost bloody (he gets reddish brown when wet).  I spoil mine and turn a heat lamp on low in one top corner of his house so he can go sit in the heat to dry or move down low if he gets too warm.  And i sometimes take a hair dryer on low (as long as it's telfon free) and blow dry him but he's hand raised and really tame and figured out quickly that he liked that.  A blow dryer even on low can be too much and too scary for some birds, and it's not really nesscary.

The breeds most often placed in this category are the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.<br>  <br>  In the media the term is vague and may include other breeds with similar physical characteristics, such as the Perro de Presa Canario, Cane Corso, Dogo Argentino, Alano Espanol, Japanese Tosa, Dogue de Bordeaux, Cordoba Fighting Dog, Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog, American Bulldog, Boxer, Valley Bulldog, Olde English Bulldogge, Renascence Bulldogge, and Banter Bulldogge. These breeds are rarely listed by name in breed-specific legislation, but they are sometimes included when the term is defined broadly and based on physical appearance."<br>  <br>  in short, there is NO STANDARD of this breed. it would be hard to tell if a dog is purebred if there are no specific basis to compare them with. the term (breed)  PITBULL is not even recognized by some big international dog clubs. some just put up their own.

This is a recipe for trouble.<br>  <br>  You should have at least 2 females for each male to keep things calm.  If you have room, add females.  The fin on the bottom of the fish just behind the belly is pointed on males and regular fan shaped on females.<br>  <br>  If you want to try and work with what you have or can't add more right now you need to isolate the agressive male.  Make sure you have a large net.  Catch the agressive male and leave it in the fishnet at the top of the tank .  It gets clean filtered water, make sure it gets food when the others do, but by putting it in isolation you take out a little of the aggression and give the other fish time to heal. A guppy breader pen is even better if you can get one - it is a mesh box that hangs inside the tank and give the agressive fish a smaller space.|`|q9aRldvPaa	i had the same problem with my guppie and my platty i just bagged my fish up n left it in the tank for a couple of days n know its ok wiv the other fish|`|QVh5Z4vbaa	i have 3 platties when i first got them they were fighting i left the for a while after bout 3 days they were fine

And his personality is just this happy go lucky little dog.  Where my female is playful and fun.  She can also settle down when needed.  Just in my past experience all small male dogs are hard to house break.  And the females are usually easier.<br>  But really it just all depends on the dog.  You can have the best male dog and the worst female dog.<br>  But anyways if you do end up getting a male.  Just start training when they are young.  Be patient and consistent.  And he will be fine.<br>  But I would probably recommend getting a female Shih-Tzu.  They are usually easier to train.  And usually more calmer.  And as for the bleeding.  Get her spayed as soon as your Vet will do it.  And if you insist on breeding her.  Then you can put a diaper on her.  They have them at Petco where they make them especially for females in season.

My male is neutered but my female is not.  As far as temperament goes, my male is much calmer than my female.  My female is a little hellion!  While there are generalizations about temperament, each dog is an individual.  My girl's heat cycles are really not very hard for me to handle at all.  Her first one came as a surprise and I had to keep her in her crate while I ran down to the pet store for doggie diapers, but after that I always have them on hand just in case I lose track of when she should be nearing her next cycle.  When you first notice blood put a diaper on her and leave it on until she goes outside to potty.  Discard the old one and put a fresh one on her when you bring her back in.  I usually need to use a diaper for about a week, then life is back to normal!|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	Yes you do neuter a female. It's called spaying, and the only way to stop her going into season and having 'periods'. The only other option is to confine her while she's bleeding. The best option is to neuter.
7erjLpuWaa	I'm not trying to get on your case, but you can't even be sure that four females won't kill each other in a 20 gallon. I would consider yourself lucky that it took this long for a fish to die.  Bettas are really unpredictable with tank mates.  They all have different temperaments.  I have a female Betta that is highly aggressive and would never house her with another fish.  Well, the only thing that you can really do now to correct this situation is to buy an aquarium for your 3 female Bettas.  Since it actually seems like they are fairly compatible, they may do Ok in a 10 gallon with a sponge filter, heater, and PLENTY of hiding spaces.  Either separate those fish, or get them a much bigger living space.  Also you said that "it looked like they needed a water change".  Unfortunately, once your fish "look like" they need a water change, you've waited entirely too long.  Ammonia damage to the gills can scar a fish permanently.  Don't beat yourself up about it, the damage is already done, but you can make it right by getting your fish a larger tank.  Fish keeping is a great hobby and is much more enjoyable when you are able to keep happy fish!  I wouldn't worry about trying to diagnose any diseases just yet (as others seem to be hinting at).  Your fish probably got the snot beat out of it and that's why it is stressed. Oh, do a fishless cycle to that 10 gallon and no, bettas do not need an air pump.  They are a labyrinth fish--they retrieve air from the surface.<br>  Kat, you have gotten some pretty good advice here and yet you are insisting that these fish can live in a 2 gallon bowl.  They simply cannot.  You do state in your post that your female was lurking at the bottom of the bowl and you thought that maybe it was because it was "time" for a water change.  My mistake there but the fact remains that four fish in one bowl are going to need a water change more often, probably daily. If you don't believe me, get a liquid ammonia test kit. Keep those fish in the bowl for a week and test that water.  I gaurantee you that the ammonia level will be off the chart.  Because Bettas breath oxygen for the surface, they are more able to be mistreated this way, but the ammonia still stresses them and burns their gills.  I think we are all just trying to help you here.  No, it is not ethical to keep those fish in that bowl.  Bettas are highly territorial and they need hiding places.  just buy the 10 gallon--you can get a complete set up for 40 bucks and CYCLE it.  I hope you take some of the good advice that has been given to you.|`|FNM8q2odaa	i'm not sure if it needs more air because betta's breathe air but they need water. i dropped mine down a broken furnace for like 3 minutes and it's still alive. she's probably cold. get one of those heating pads from walmart in the pharmacy section(the ones people use when they're sore)|`|CqquoBy4aa	It most likely means that it needs more air.  You should do a water change and make sure you have a filter.  If you have a filter, it means you have to replace or clean a filter pad.|`|JivLAZH6aa	yes she is dying<br>  <br>  im sorry|`|h1zWBH4Uaa	she can be dying, but with fast action you can save her. first of all, your tank is too small (i know, a pain) so you will either have to divide your fish and get a couple small tanks, or just get one bigger tank(recommended much more) that is over 10 gallons. since Betta's are tropical fish, make sure you have a heater and a filter. but you will also most definitely need an air pump. have you ever noticed her swimming to the top, and she sort of looks like she is drinking the water from the surface? well she isn't drinking the water from the surface, she is trying to get some oxygen. all fish need it.  <br>  <br>  you are probably right about the fish attacking her, but it might not be for the reason you think. if they were fine before, she must have gotten sick, and when fish get sick, their tank mates pick at them until they die, unfortunately. so it's definitely a good thing you quarantined her. but did you do it the right way? the best steps for quarantining a sick betta are: Use the same tank water to avoid an abrupt change of water condition when you first jar the sick betta. before you do your next water change, you should acclimate the betta slowly to the water you will be using for the water change. I recommend that you remove 75% of the water and gradually add a bit of water every hour until the bowl is full. This will ensure the betta acclimate smoothly from the previous tank water to tap water or whatever other clean water you are going to add. Remember that tank water may be different in quality because of plants, rocks, heaters and filters you are using in there. Whereas a bare bowl adds nothing to the water. And that is why you should acclimate the betta when you do the first water change. After that you will not need to worry about doing a normal 100% water change.<br>  <br>  Important: Be sure to wash your hands with a good antibacterial soap after handling your sick fish to not spread diseases to your healthy ones. Anything that comes in contact with the sick fish (fish net, fingers, spoon, jar, etc) will have to be disinfected prior to being used for other fish<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  the most probable reason your fish is acting this way is being she has fin or tail rot, or maybe even both. <br>  uGENERAL INFO:<br>  <br>  This disease comes mainly from dirty water. If you keep his water VERY clean Mr. Betta will never get tail/fin rot. It is not overly contagious, and bettas will more than likely recover if treated promptly. Fins/tail will grow back, though may not have same color or may not look as good or be as long. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  frayed fins and a darker edge are clear signs of fin rot<br>   <br>  uSYMPTOMS: <br>  <br>  Betta’s fins and/or tail seem to be getting shorter and shorter. Or they seem to be falling apart and dissolving. There may be a darker color (or a reddish one) to the edge of the betta’s fins/tail. He may be still active and eating normally, or may have stopped eating, fins may be clumped, color may be pale. <br>  uTREATMENT: <br>  <br>  Do a full jar water change. Use tetracycline or Ampicillin (included in our Betta First Aid Kit) combined with Fungus Eliminator (included in our Betta First Aid Kit). Change water every third day and add a new dose of same medication. Continue until fins/tail stop receding and start showing some new growth. This may take up to 4 weeks, so don’t give up. Once rot stops and fins start growing back you can stop treatment, but not before then.   <br>  Note: If the rot is very slight or mild, you could use Maracyn I and Maracyn II (together at half the dose each) by Mardel. These med can help but are not very powerful. They come in hard tablet which is a real pain to administer. You'll have to crush them into a powder before you can administer to a betta in a bowl. A tablet treats 10 gal of water, so you do the math. Do not overmedicate! If you are caught by surprise and do not have a First Aid Betta Kit (naughty naughty), then you can run to a local Petco or something and probably find the Maracyn I & II and at least try that. My advice though? Be ready! Get your Betta First Aid Kit now so you have the real powerful stuff at hand and are ready when the you-know-what hits the fan! <br>  <br>  if you don't act quick, then this could turn into advanced tail and body rot, whick is harder to cure. <br>  uGENERAL INFO:  <br>  <br>  This disease starts as a regular fin rot, but the rot progresses quite rapidly and is harder to stop. Soon no fins are left as all tissues have been eaten away. Then the rot proceeds to attack the body. Not a pretty picture. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  close up of a tail and fins that are being eaten away by the advanced rot, you can see the top dorsal is almost all gone and the bacteria is getting ready to attack the body now.<br>   <br>  uSYMPTOMS:   <br>  Fins and or tail start rotting away, usually starting from the edge, but sometimes it starts at the base of the fin (especially dorsal) and attacks the body directly. Diseases progresses rapidly and as the tissues are being eaten away, y|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Does this bowl even have a filter and a heater?<br>  <br>  Two gallons is much too small for four female Betta's. Living without an aquarium heater and a filter would only make matters worse. They are tropical fish and require an aquarium heater to maintain their temperatures between 77F-82F. They should have a ten gallon aquarium at least, and filtration is necessary for all fish.<br>  <br>  The one female is probably suffering from fin rot, brought on by poor water quality. Never keep fish, even Betta's, in a bowl.<br>  <br>  ~Thank you for the thumbs down, but I never said that female Betta's couldn't live together nor did I yell at you. Females can live together in groups of at least four with a filter, heater, and an appropriately sized tank.<br>  <br>  ~Yes Betta's prefer a tank with little to no current, but neither do they want stagnant water. Even though Betta's are labyrinth fish, they primarily use their gills to breath just like any other fish. They do require filters, and there are filters that are gentle enough for them i.e sponge filters.|`|8qECRiuMaa	U NEVER PUT MORE THEN ONE BETA IN THE BOAL!!!!!!!!!

Phone the breeder with your concerns and they will set you on the right track.|`|NlvghuIkaa	Puppies will be puppies. However the biting has gone far beyond play at this point in time. Obviously he is ignoring the social warnings you are giving so using body movements is bound to work. <br>  <br>  When your dog bites you, completely stop what you are doing and turn your head to the side. If you keep it stationary he should start to release. Why did he do that suddenly you ask? Well, turning your head to the side in dog talk means, "Back off before I bite you". Wonderful huh? <br>  <br>  I would seriously recommend some puppy school and training before the issue becomes any worse for you and the family. In the meantime, muzzling on walks and visiting occasions may be a must. It is always better to be safe rather than sorry.I believe neutering him at this age may not be the best idea due to further personality growth though if suggested by a trainer, it may not be such a bad idea.|`|rVUCTz3Taa	when he bites you stand up and put your back to him with your arms crossed and ignor him and sometimes when you yell at a dog it scares them and thats why they bite heres a site that may help you-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_18746_stop-puppy-biting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_18746_stop-puppy...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|UG95JpJxaa	OH SHOOT, if ur dog trys to AGGRESSIVELY bite you then it means it has some dog biting disease, no dog would bite their owner AGGRESSIVELY.|`|lj3hNR9baa	Watch the Dog Whisperer on The National Geographic channel. Judging from how you're interacting with you puppy, he is asserting his dominance and letting you know that he's the one in charge and not you.

G0KKfXMUaa	Rolling is a natural thing. Normally, when on the beach or some place damp like that, I try to be prepared for that and always keep at a forward walk. <br>  <br>  I've had horses try to roll with me in the arena by a puddle. If you begin to see them sniff the ground and kind of bend, just lift her head up and give her a kick. But sometimes you just don't know it's going to happen and have to get off. But she's fine, and you handled it okay for not knowing what happened. Just try not to yell at her. <br>  <br>  That's almost like me yelling at you for scratching your bug bit. Just try to prevent her from doing it.<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  <br>  "Horses roll for four different reasons: For pleasure, For self maintenance or grooming, to relieve pain or discomfort, or for rest. If your horse is not in a situation where rolling is dangerous or innapropriate, allow him to roll. It is one of the few personal pleasures a domesticated horse has, so let him enjoy it and don't worry about your wasted grooming job!" <br>  <br>  Check out this website, it has everything you need to know.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.equusite.com/articles/health/healthRolling.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.equusite.com/articles/health/...</a>|`|bb083bf20bed6e8b5472929ca09b9b09aa	A lot of horses like to roll in sand because the surface molds to them and so is softer and less abrasive on their back/joints. <br>  <br>  Most horses will roll after being hosed, so if your horse was wet from the beach, she probably wanted to roll in the drier sand to dry herself off. It's a natural reaction.<br>  <br>  A lot of Thoroughbreds are also trained to roll when turned loose in a sand area or round yard before they are hosed down (so they don't roll in their boxes after being washed and get covered in manure or worse, cast against a wall). <br>  <br>  Next time, you just have to make sure you keep her head up and keep her moving. She will normally show some signs of thinking about it. Don't jump off and let her roll when she wants to, keep her moving. Then when you decide it is OK for her to roll in the sand, you can dismount and put her on a long lead (lunge line or similar) and let her roll at her own leisure. Teach her that there is a time and a place when it is OK to roll in the sand, and that it is NOT OK to roll when you are mounted, as this could have been extremely dangerous.|`|5UW2P8IMaa	Sometimes a horse will want to roll when it is feeling "itchy" --  you can sometimes sense when they are going to stop.  The big thing is to keep them from stopping.  Dig your heels in when you get that sensation.<br>  <br>  Keep your horse well groomed.  This is the time of year when they are shedding, and you will need to regularly curry them to help with the shedding process.|`|8d25j8CYaa	I would have done nothing different except to get back on. You might check the saddle to see if something is hurting her. I have had young horses pull this trick when they want to go to the barn. It doesn't work with me. With young horses it can mean the are tired. <br>  <br>  Natural horsemanship is building a partnership with a horse. Getting the horse to go along with your program willingly. It doesn't involve beating, using harsher bit to control a horse, or otherwise mistreating a horse to get it to do what you want.

6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	The way I was told by my trainer, was to yelp a high pitched "ouch!" if my puppy bit me. Then take your hand away/put the dog down and ignore the dog for 10 seconds or so. Then, give them the opportunity to do it again, and repeat the reaction is they continue to bite.<br>  <br>  Never take away your hand to stop them biting as it doesn't teach them not to do it. You need to give them the chance to bite, and then react like their littermates would and take away the playtime/attention. They learn quick if you are consistent - my pup has. Good luck!
oDVx7nSxaa	A six week old kitten should still be with mom for at least two weeks!  If you can leave her with mom for additional time, that would be best.  Kittens are not reliably weaned and using the litter box at 6 weeks, but it seems that "conventional wisdom" means owners push them out the door too early.<br>  <br>  Having said that, if you have no choice but to take the kitten at 6 weeks, feed her canned, preferably with a bit of KMR (Kitten Milk Replacement) mixed in to make it a bit more soupy.  She'll have less trouble eating that than the dry.  Also make sure that you have more than one litter box in very accessible locations so that she has fewer accidents.  She's still such a baby.  <br>  <br>  Those feeding instructions are very confusing.  And the latest research, BTW, confirms that feeding canned is better than dry.  But at least you've chosen an excellent food - the Wellness canned is the staple food in this household.  To interpret those feeding instructions, I believe what they are meaning to tell you is that they need 1/4 cup per feeding, but if you are feeding canned and dry, one of the dry feedings would be replaced with a 3-ounce can.  <br>  <br>  Kittens can eat enourmous quantities of food to fuel their growth.  Don't be surprised if they eat more than the package states.  What I would suggest is split a can between the two of them at least twice a day, with the dry there to nibble on between feedings.  If the small kitten cans are taking you broke, feel free to use the adult Wellness in the larger cans.  It's more economical, and really has the same nutrition as their kitten formula.  They won't be shortchanged at all by eating the adult canned - trust me, the adult premium foods have pleanty of protein and nutrition to feed a growing kitten!<br>  <br>  My foster kittens all get Innova EVO and adult Wellness, and they thrive.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO you should not adopt a kitten till 10-12 weeks old.  A 6 week old kitten is STILL nursing!<br>  <br>  Anyway, I would feed more canned kitten food with some crunchy on the side.  Canned is better for them anyway.  And up to 4-5 months old, they should be free feed. <br>  <br>  Be sure to get them spayed/neutered by 3-4 months old so they don't breed.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Kittens should stay with their mothers until at least 10-12 weeks old.  After weaning, mom cats teach their kittens important social and survival skills they need their whole lives.  Kittens taken too soon often have biting and scratching issues which can cause dissatisfied owners to put them outside, have them declawed, or even turn them in to shelters. Letting them stay with their mothers a few more weeks is definitely worth the wait so your kitten can have the chance to learn to become a well-mannered cat.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't mix the food.  Bacteria can grow on dry food that's become wet and it could make the kittens sick.  An all wet diet would be best for them for their whole lives  but if you must feed some dry, feed it to them separate from the wet.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of good articles on cat feeding that may help shed some light on the subject for you.<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=doesdryfoodcleantheteeth" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=004" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	I'm sorry the mom's owner isn't seeing reason about the tiny one.<br>  <br>  As far as the food goes, if you can do more wet food than that it would be better.  It's better in general and the 6 week old is still getting her teeth in.  They can chew food at that age but it'll be easier for her to eat wet food.<br>  <br>  As far the feeding instructions, I'd just forget about them. They're kittens, let them eat as much as they want.  Just don't put too much out at a time so it won't go bad. As long as you're feeding dry food to kittens I would just leave some out.  Meal times are better but I would worry with little ones that they aren't getting enough. If you are around the house most of the day then for kittens that young they probably need 4 meals a day.  It's a bit of a guessing game how much food they will actually eat.  My cats do not eat even close to the amount recommended but the only one losing weight is the one who was fat anyway.  They just don't need as much food as is recommended. Some cats will need to eat more than the recommended amount.  Considering how much growing those little ones will do I would let them eat as much as their tiny tummies allow. Then start gradually switching to meal times around 6 months old. The amount they eat will change a lot as their stomachs grow so I wouldn't worry too much right now about guidelines.  If you do meal times just put away any food they don't finish, then you won't have to worry about waste.  <br>  <br>  Once they aren't growing so quickly it will get easier to determine how much food they actually eat. Guidelines can be a good starting place, but every cat is different.
uD8aC42eaa	What she's figured out so far is that if she cries, you will look at her, come to her, and try to comfort her.  She'll get attention.  After you take her to the vet and make sure she's not in pain or have something medically wrong, try this:<br>  <br>  Only look at her or pay any attention to her at all when she's quiet.  It will SUCK for a little while, and she'll cry her little heart out trying to get you to cave in, but DO NOT cave in!  If you cave in, she'll just learn that she needs to cry VERY LOUD and for a LONG TIME and then you'll come.  Once she stops crying, you can look at her.  If she starts crying again, look away and go about your business.  If she's quiet again, look at her.  If she stays quiet, you can go close to her (she should be in her crate during all this, but make sure to take her to potty and give her food, just ignore her and don't pet her and put her back in the crate if she's crying).  If she starts crying when you get close, move away and stop looking at her, do your own thing again.  If she stops crying, look at her, get close to her, put your hand down on the lock to let her out of the crate, etc, etc.  Keep going step by step, and don't ever ever ever do anything to comfort her while she's crying.  Its going to feel terrible, but if you want her to quit, you just have to do it until she understands that she won't get ANY attention at all from anybody in the house (make sure everyone understands they shouldn't look at her or mess with her while you're training her) until she's quiet and calm and that no matter how long or loud she cries or barks or whatever, she doesn't get any attention until she's quiet and calm.  Good luck!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	I'm with Ms Manners - first thing to do is a full vet check to be sure she is healthy. This is most likely a behavioural thing tho - far more details are needed, for instance her background, to even have a clue what is going on. You can start by chatting this through with the vet, they can probably refer you to a suitable behaviourist, because this is probably what the dog needs.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Do you know what her background is?  If its a behavioral thing, it would help to know.<br>  If you havent already I would take her to the vet for an exam, to eliminate any physical problems as the source of her crying.|`|sHTpXUScaa	Ignore her 100% don't pet her until she is quiets. She has learned that crying works on everyone because being so noisy naturally drawn more people's attention. She cries to manipulate you to get what she wants. You need to give her a lot of attention when she is quiet and ignore when she is being loud.  <br>  <br>    You need to beef it up because the more she learns how to manipulate you the harder you will have to break her bad habit.  Any dogs who I have fostered or adopted came to me with different problems. Some were a cry baby,  but I kept them in crate all the time and they would cry for two  straight days. I have never let them out until they are quiet.  They have learned that crying only make them stay in there longer so when they are being quiet. I allow them to come out. They all have stopped crying now.|`|BaoCQQraaa	I would guess that she would have to go to the vet for medical problems or if anything is wrong with her hand.|`|Njm7RF4zaa	Bring her to a dog trainer.|`|9g7eeUmaaa	First, rule out any chance that it's a medical problem. She could be trying to tell you that something is wrong. Other than that, it sounds like she is becoming too attention starved. If this is the case, you absolutely must ignore the cries & then only pet her when she stops. That way, she'll know that crying won't allow her to get her way. Only when she is quiet and well behaved she can have some petting & affection. <br>  Good luck & try to stay patient with her. It's too bad that dogs can't speak english, it would make things much easier!|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	it's a puggle mix what do you expect....you take a very whiny beagle and breed it with a very whiny pug, and what do you get?  very whiny puppies!

Good luck with it all!|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	In what capacity do you want to work with birds: in a zoo, in the wild, in a pet shop, as a wildlife rehabilitator?  Requirements vary depending on what kind of work you want to do.  If you want to work with wild birds you will need at least a bachelors degree in zoology, biology, etc.  If you want to get a higher degree..it is then that you can specialize in ornithology and do your thesis on birds.  You don't necessarily need a degree to work in a zoo (although it is preferred).  Many zoos have volunteer and internship opportunities to work you way up to a paid keeper position..although you may not be able to pick and choose where you end up..you can request to care for birds, but it may take you a while to earn this position.  You can also start volunteering at a local wildlife rehab where they care for birds.|`|d8EtbTXnaa	I'd definitely do some volunteer work with birds if you can, do you live in the UK? The RSPB is a great organisation to work with, and a career with animals is so competitive. I do research on birds now, but I start a new job at a wildlife rehab centre - which I don't think I could have done without volunteering! And I did a degree in animal conservation science :o)|`|nHp8zzkjaa	To see if it is something that you really want to do look into if you can volunteer at a bird rescue center. If you want to work with them in a professional matter with a good paying job then you need to get into zoology classes.
dE5fs9yzaa	I wouldn't. I've seen algae eaters go after golds, especially the slower fancy ones. Besides, algae eaters need warmer water then golds, which do best at around 68 degrees.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	How large is the tank?<br>  <br>  No. Because tropical fish and coldwater fish should not be mixed.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	No, they tend not to do very well together.<br>  <br>  If your tank is very large you may be able to get away with it, but anything under 25 gallons would be problematic.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|h1zWBH4Uaa	i wouldn't do it. freshwater fish and tropical fish shouldn't be kept in the same tank. if you put in a heater it's nice for the tropical fish, but it stresses your freshwater fish, and vice versa. <br>  <br>  also the food is different, because most tropical fish are vegetarians and they need a lot of vegetable content, while goldfish food has lower protein but higher carbohydrate content. if one eats the other, they won't die, but it can lead to obesity, which THEN can lead to death. <br>  <br>  also, goldfish create A LOT of waste, they are EXTREMELY dirty fish. they don't do well with any other fish, except for other goldfish, and plus, they grow to be HUGE, so you will most likely have to get a larger tank. you have fish goldfish? they can grow to be 12 inches long, and that means you will need an 80+ gallon tank... and you are gonna need one good filter, if not two. good luck with that!|`|w1jyHMRbaa	yes...algae eaters are fresh water fish...at least the kind i have are. you will have to supply it with algae pellets also.

hktbfRPWaa	First, change the gate. Second, I don't know what that tells you. I also don't know at what points he tells you to yank the dog, but if it is while walking there are other ways. If he is yanking the dog to hurt it then that is cruel - if it is just slight so the dog notices and stops that's different. I also would not use a choke chain, use a halti collar or harness.<br>  <br>  While walking just stop and change direction when he pulls. Keep doing that until he learns he won't get anywhere by pulling. When he walks well praise him. If there is any food he likes give him some of that sometimes as a treat.<br>  <br>  If he hates men maybe try and teach him not all men are bad. This may take time - same with dogs, although perhaps it would be better to stay away from dogs and just teach him not to do anything if he does see one.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	Yanking a traumatized dog might not be the best thing to do. He doesn't like the treats? <br>  <br>  Then find something he does like to play/eat!<br>  <br>  Treats are not just those colorful and supposedly yummy stuff that you buy from a pet stor, but also anything the dog might like to eat every once in a while. <br>  <br>  Praising also works.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Put a padlock on your gate so your dog can't get out.  It's your responsibility to keep him safely confined.  It's not his fault if he can get out.  Are you not concerned that he might get run over?<br>  <br>  I would not waste money on Don Sullivan and his silly secrets. Someone should tell him that bullying a dog is no secret. <br>  <br>  Most dogs will obey a command once you teach them what the actual command is. If you don't teach them they can't obey something they don't understand.
QB0CnrmJaa	Well yes they are very sad and unhappy because they are living with many, many other chickens and they don't get much attention. I think you should maybe buy some for the poor things because they sound so sad and alone and probably want for you to take them home. I suggest you buy one that doesn't run from you when you walk in, or one that would run up to you.<br>  <br>  Warren hen's are all different and it is no reason to call the RSPCA. They probably have dirt or food on their head, or some are getting old and losing their color. This is normal, and please don't tell anyone because they will probably end up getting wringed.<br>  <br>  The chickens are fine. Don't worry! Hope this helped :)|`|rQlzfHqraa	Chickens look dull when moulting, are mating and laying constantly or when too crowded. Sometimes these things are stressful. Some thing lacking in the diet could also be a factor. I would go back in about a week or two to see if things are the same. A good farm may be missing something for the chickens.|`|BFvxkrBkaa	take it to the vet<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  xxx
FaPrr8bbaa	My miniature schnauzer outgrew her petite paws collar by the time she was 12 weeks.  A buckle type petite paws collar is the size of a average mans wrist (using the biggest setting).  I vote for the snap closure because puppies just wiggle too much for a buckle.  The pup should have two fingers of extra space in his collar.  Check to make sure it can not slide off his head as a frightening sound can turn pup into tazmanian cartoon character.  I like a long lead of 6 foot for potty training purposes and a 4 foot for walking for exercise.|`|AA11101806	If you are in the U.S.A.  you can find 7" - 14"  (17.75cm - 35.5cm) adjustable collars at most dollar stores (or similar stores).   They should work well for your dog.<br>  <br>  <br>  The leash/lead is a matter of how close you want the dog to be to you while on it.  Given that you have a smaller dog, a 2m - 3m leash should work well for your pet.  You can get either a regular canvas leash or a retractable leash.
P9byozx9aa	So you don't ruin their fur, use baby powder, it attracks the dirt and just brush it through their fur.|`|1taf83DCaa	Rabbits are constantly grooming themselves and short of an accident such as urine stains that become smelly or occasional diarrhea there is absolutely no reason to bath a pet rabbit. Good grooming with a brush can be done because rabbits can expel fur balls and cause intestinal problems and induce vomiting. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Purchase hypoallergenic, non-medicated pet shampoo from your veterinarian or pet supply store. Hy-Lyte is a good choice, but any similar product will work as well. DO NOT USE ANY TYPE OF HUMAN SHAMPOO ON YOUR RABBIT. Rabbit skin is far more delicate and sensitive than human skin--especially the scalp. Even baby shampoo is far too harsh, and can make the problem worse, not better. Fill a bathroom sink to about 2.5" depth with lukewarm water.Mix in about a tablespoon of shampoo, and mix well. Being firm and gentle so that the bunny cannot jump and injure himself, lower his rear end into the lukewarm shampoo/water, and gently lave the solution onto the soiled areas until they are clean. If the bunny is very messy, you may have to change the water and do this twice. Rinse with lukewarm, clear running water very thoroughly, leaving NO shampoo residue. Towel dry carefully, being sure not to rub to hard against irritated skin. Blow dry on low, keeping your hand close to bunny's skin so that you can tell if the air flow is too hot. The last thing you want to do is burn already inflamed skin! When bunny is fluffy-dry, carefully clip away the fur on the areas where the skin is irritated. If you can't see the skin, or are doubtful where skin ends and fur begins, then *do not clip!* Rabbit skin is *very* thin and stretchy, and even a small wound can expand to alarming proportions! <br>  <br>  Apply a soothing balm, such as Calendula (from the Health Food Store) or triple antibiotic ointment (e.g., Neosporin, but NOT Neosporin Plus, which contains Lidocaine and is not recommended). <br>  <br>  <br>  Repeat as necessary, but do not continue if rabbit seems unduly stressed by the experience. Whenever you handle a bunny, it's important to be firm, gentle and ready to release the bunny at ground level if she starts to struggle violently. As you probably know, one good kick can dislocate or even fracture the spine. Always keep the bunny's safety *first* in mind if you attempt a project like this (For more info on dry and wet baths go to <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/buttbath.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/buttbath.h...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  It is true that some rabbits enjoy having a bath, however, remember that domesticated rabbits do not know how to swim and there is a risk of drowning. Also keep in mind that rabbit fur takes a *long* time to dry, so after the bath be sure to spend some quality drying time; again with a towel or a blow dryer. And again, be sure that the blow dryer is not set too hot. Even a bunny without irritated skin can get burned on a low setting. Keep your hand there as a gauge. <br>  <br>  Its ok to give your rabbit a bath but you shouldnt because it washes the special oil out of theyre coat that keeps it clean and shiney. The best way to give your rabbit a bath is to wet a cloth and simple wipe them down.|`|Oti6JXJIaa	noooo! just take a wet wash cloth and wash him with that. they dont like water. you might need to seperate them to one of them may be teritorial and thats why he pees on the other one.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Its done in dominance,especially if they are unaltered rabbits.<br>  <br>  You can wash them,however its stressful to rabbits & if they over struggle & kick,this can damage their delicate spines. I wouldn't suggest you wash them more than once a MONTH.<br>  <br>  1.Use a bucket or basin,about 2-3 inches of LUKEWARM water,not hot nor cold. You will need a gentle human shampoo or Rabbit Shampoo. I prefer to use this,if i ever need to wash them. Do NOT use bleaches,or whiting shampoos. <br>  <br>  2. Try & stop them from kicking when washing them,as it may affect their spines. Massage the shampoo right in & rinse THOROUGHLY. It may affect their skin,e.g. dry it out/make it sore etc if you don't properly rinse them off.<br>  <br>  3. Make sure they are very well dried off,especially if they are outdoor kept rabbits. Some people use hair-driers,although this just stresses them more. Use a nice dry towel,that should do it!<br>  <br>  Neutering should stop unwanted spraying behaviours,if they aren't already done.<br>  <br>  Good luck.xxx|`|SJ9PuBvdaa	Yes, you can wash a rabbit but try not to do it too often (only when there's pee on him). Use a gentle shampoo like baby shampoo or kitten/small animal shampoo. Fill up a basin or the tub only a little bit and make sure the water is warm but not too hot. Be careful not to get any water in their ears. Their ears are very sensitive. When the bath is over, dry him with a towel and brush or comb the fur when it is wet, it could irritate the skin. Make sure he's dry before putting him back in the cage. They don't generally like water, so make sure he isn't too scared. Good luck!!|`|AA10251347	You can give a rabbit a bath but he won't like it! You will need to have someone to help wash him and please be careful to keep shampoo out of the face and ears. In fact, it is better to just wash (with rabbit shampoo from the pet store) from the neck down only and do it as fast as you can without hurrying so much you accidentally hurt him. Good luck!
JiCKFTuIaa	There are two ways. <br>  #1 is genetic, and the only solution is to NOT BREED dogs with bad hips.<br>  #2 is environmental, and there are several things that you can do. Fat rolly-polly puppy equals displastic adult, so keep the pup a little bit on the lean side. Slow down their growth rate by feeding them a "large breed" puppy formula. Exercise them on soft surfaces keeping them off pavement as much as possible.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  "3.

They also have surgery that can be done on it but i didn't have to do that with my dog, she lived until she was 12 years old and passed away from Cancer.<br>   As long as you give your dog proper exercise and keep her weight down you shouldn't have a problem with it either, its when the dog isn't getting proper exercise and gains a lot of weight it will start effecting it.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	it's when the bones grow to quickly and the hip or shoulder doesn't really fit the socket this is very painful nothin really you can do just hope your dog grows correctly i don't think this dog will get it it's us usually more in the bigger breeds  and can developer over time from pressure on bad hips and joints if you take the dog to the vet the can test him to see how prone he is to getting hip diplasia  good luck|`|qapJU3tMaa	DYSPLASIA and it's SHEPHERD,  You get a pup from a reputable breeder who will give you a health guarantee.

Are you serious??? Dont let your dog drive (On the road atleast maybe on a farm or clear land you could try)...

I'd hope you're kidding.|`|UG95JpJxaa	OH YEAH MY DOG CAN DRIVE BABY!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Even if you taught him to drive, he would still need to take the written driving test and the on the road test and get his photo license before he really can drive. <br>  <br>  Don't forget he has to be at least 16 yrs old in human years to take the test.|`|jpTl3o5naa	No, try telling that to the police when they pull you and the dog over. It should have a dog license, but not a driver license. It is also dangerous for all in the car and other people.

I had him in a 1 gal bowl.|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	It might just be that no one knows of a heater that works well in a bowl.  The small amount of water would be hard to keep stable temperature wise with or without a heater.  That's why it's better to keep fish in a tank instead of a bowl, because then you can actually use the proper equipment. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hydor-T11702-THEO-Heater-25W/dp/B0006JLPG8/ref=pd_sim_dbs_k_23" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Hydor-T11702-THEO-...</a>|`|4t10YACQaa	oh and I think you can by little thermometers that stick to the bowl.
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Take the pup to the vet for a full health check.<br>  <br>  I guess you bought this dog from a back yard breeder.  How do you know they didn't feed the puppy on the day you bought him?<br>  <br>  If you got him from an ethical registered breeder you would have the breeders full support and assistance.<br>  <br>  It's always risky buying from byb's because they're not interested in the health or welfare of the dog, only the money they can make. You take a gamble on whether or not your puppy is healthy when you buy from byb's.<br>  Do you know if this pup has been wormed and vaccinated?|`|2fGHF3RQaa	Puppies don't know when to stop eating and drinking.  A lot of sellers won't feed their dog if they feel the dog will be sold that day because dogs get car sick very easy.  I wouldn't worry about it, unless he starts acting sick.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Well if you bought your puppy from a Reputable Breeder then they usually will have health guarantees.<br>  But if you bought your puppy from a Backyard Breeder.  Then it wouldn't surprise me if your puppy was sick.  As Backyard Breeders.  Don't really know much about dogs.  And don't take very good care of their dogs.<br>  Has your puppy been wormed?<br>  Has your puppy been vaccinated?<br>  Call your Vet and make an appointment for your Vet.  <br>  For a Check-Up and shots.  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|rVUCTz3Taa	Maybe since he is a pup he drinks alot but i cant remember my puppy continuously drinking and if the seller tried to hide it then maybe there is something wrong with him... Ring the vet and ask what you should do..<br>  <br>  Good Luck
zkcCGnTDaa	theres not much information to work with, is his belly big? He can have swim bladder problem. This causes him to swim unbalanced and to float. If he does, don't feed him for about 2 days, (make sure he wont starve however)after 2 days get a frozen pea and boil it, then take off the shell and feed it to him, this will help his digestive system, don't feed him any thing else until his stomach is back to normal. As for the cut, it might not be to serious depending on how big, or deep the cut is. You can simply keep him the tank (make sure he has enough room) and a filter make sure the water is warm, and put salt (aquarium salt) this will help the wound heal, and keep any bacterial from infecting it, also make sure that you always treat tap water. Good luck :]|`|KxNdCO4Vaa	Just let the fish swim around and be a fish, if it dies it dies, as long as it is swimming (somewhat lol) and eating, it's fine.|`|CqquoBy4aa	You should make sure it is in the tank long enough so that it will be well recovered.  You don't have to buy a medicine.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	try add stress coat that will help him with the stress and also help him regain the slime that he lost<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You could go to the pet store and pick up medication for him. The medication is to ensure that he does not develop an infection from this cut.<br>  <br>  It's not like he has dropsy and there is no hope for him. A tiny cut can heal with time. On a tank as small as five gallons, I would perform partial water changes daily. A fish on the mend needs perfect water quality.

Goldfish (if you're up for simple).  Tiger barbs.  Or you could get African Dwarf Frogs.  They're not too good with semi-aggressive fish though.  1 inch per gallon.

She loves to play and be active. She is very much a people dog. If you are looking for a dog that loves to be cuddled and enjoys being active than a Pembroke would be a good choice. They are very smart and love to learn. They are also small (only 20 to 25 pounds) so they are good lap dogs. But I also agree that a lot of dog breeds can be cuddly and active so adopting a mixed breed dog would be just as rewarding as getting a pure bred. Besides there are a lot of great dogs out there that need homes.|`|SXfWmOYHaa	I have a chocolate lab/pointer mix and she is VERY affectionate. <br>  <br>  She is calm and docile in the house and when he is outside she wants to run all over and is very active.  <br>  <br>  Not sure if I got lucky with her or if the breeds play into it.<br>  <br>  Border Collies or Australian Shepherds are also loving and VERY energetic.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	a doberman or a dalmatian are very energetic, my dob is alone 4 hours a day without a problem and he is only 7 months.he is also the most sweet and loving dog i ever owned( i had  a mut ,labrador,setter) with the benefit that he is so much clever than any other breed i owned, by 4 months he obeyed this commands: sit,stay, stop, lay down, play dead,roll over and search .he is also good with my 6 year old and with any other pets (i have cats and rabbits)|`|inFdpMr6aa	golden retrievers and border collies fit that description and golden retrievers are especially playful until they turn 1 and are playful for there entire lifes border collies are smart and they stick by your side but dont mind being left alone|`|211g9bsBaa	a lab and a retriever would be best. they have all of the qualities and more. but a lot of dogs r like that. so u might want to go to a shelter and see what one fits u the most. hope this helped!!|`|BpiRHDEZaa	My auntie has a Labrador.

I have a small list of dogs that could suit your needs.<br>  <br>  Papillons - very intelligent, alot like collies..in a smaller package. VERY affectionate, amazing energy levels (can be lazy little things, but once you say 'walkies' theyre up for a hike!)<br>  <br>  Pomeranian<br>  German Spitz<br>  Volpino<br>  American Eskimo<br>  Japanese Spitz<br>  Schipperke<br>   - these are all very similar. the top two are less energy than the bottom, but still good energy! all are affectionate, small and sooo cuddly =]<br>  <br>  Beagle!!!!!! -  good energy, not VERY small... but hey :) and also affectionate.<br>  not exactly what you wanted, but theyre lovely =]<br>  <br>  Poodle! - I know this seems prissy, but poodles became popular for a reason! theyre VERY clever :D the smaller ones have a good energy, easily trained, affectionate, easy to live with, clean, and VERY SOFT :d affectionate towards owners =]<br>  <br>  Spaniel  -  most spaniels would be suited to your ideas.. however, I actually would suggets agasint the cavalier. this is because theyre so overbred, most become ill through a degenerative disease within three years. I strongly suggets perhaps a springer/cocker, or a field spaniel. I would call them almost perfect dogs !!!<br>  <br>  Staffies - VERY affectionate, great energy, although not..very small...<br>  <br>  Many terriers dont actually like being picked up alot, and many arent infact as well suited to home life as peopel like to think. Theyre often huge dogs in undersized packets. They have tendencies to rip things up when bored, theyre often stubborn and require stripping of the coat frequently. However, they are high energy, and are often the most loyal of all dogs types.<br>  <br>  I think you could, generally speaking, have any dog from the above list, if you spend time with them. <br>  There are breed rescues out there in many countires, so you could find a dog of a particular breed needing a home, that is totally house broken ect, wihtout having the hassle of teaching a puppy EVERYTHING.<br>  <br>  if you do buy a puppy, its important to try and meet both parents, and assess temperment from them.<br>  <br>  Please, also.  do more research? reading stories about breeds form owners is fun, informative and gives you ideas of how the dog would fit into your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|MKuDawP7aa	There are many different types of pets that are out there to choose from, but some are just beginning to be popular as pets for people. Prairie dogs are becoming a popular pet for people to have in their homes.<br>  <br>  Prairie dogs are part of the squirrel family, and there are currently 5 different species of prairie dogs in the US. Black-tailed prairie dogs are currently the popular breed for bringing into your home as pets. This species is also found in the central region of Texas and around the southern area of New Mexico. If these pets are properly socialized with people, they can be very affectionate creatures with a special bond to their owners. To make this special bond with your prairie dog, you need to hold and be affectionate a lot with your prairie dog while it is a baby. The prairie dog will begin to recognize you as its owner, and will become affectionate with you as well. You must remember that these pets are also exotic and wild, so there is a specific diet that they will require on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  The one thing that you should remember is that you should not over-feed your prairie dog. These are small pets, so feeding them more than once a day with a snack is too much. You should also remember that prairie dogs are complete vegetarians. This means that their primary source of nutrition should be different types of grass. As a treat, you can choose to give them some type of leaves or vegetation. You should also consider adding rabbit pellets to your prairie dogs diet. These pellets will help to add nutrients to your prairie dog that they normally wouldn't get in the types of grass that you are feeding your pet.<br>  <br>  The next factor that you should consider is the type of cage that you will have the prairie dog in. Although these are small pets, they require a lot of space in order to stay happy and healthy. They are also quite energetic, so having a wheel for them will help. You should also take time daily to play with and hold your prairie dog. When they are raised with you, they will want that emotional bonding time. If they don't spend enough time with you bonding, they could become depressed and even sick.|`|ztMeGHY0aa	Go to the pound and have a look at some of the dogs there. You could tell which one will be suitable for you immediately|`|bIaywrBCaa	sounds like you are looking for a smaller dog, maybe a miniature pinschers.

Rw7gi86Naa	Very cute! I love the third picture! Without pedigree papers, he would be considered a domestic mediumhair.<br>  <br>  Most cats we own are mixed breed domestic cats, not purebreds. If your cat has some similar features as a purebred cat which you've seen, it doesn't necessarily mean your cat is that breed. For instance, a shorthair cat that was born in America is not necessarily an American Shorthair cat. Just as not every black cat is a Bombay, and not every gray cat is a Chartreux. Also terms like calico, tortoise shell, tabby, and tuxedo are words used to describe the color and pattern; they are not breeds. <br>  <br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|XzXpDPpfaa	Oh god.. he looks exactly like my kitten that... got stolen... *cries*<br>  <br>  I've no idea what your cat is, but he's absolutely gorgeous.

Not a tabby as the stripes are not on the body.  Creams and Red do have some faint tabby markings on the tail, but to be a tabby, you have to have darker stripes.<br>  <br>  Be sure to groom him every day with a comb to keep the long fur from matting :)<br>  <br>  He's a domestic longhair with possible Persian in him.|`|sUN7TVtzaa	he looks like a big fluffy tabby cat!<br>  so cute!!

ZdQtNNI9aa	Put them into separate cages. Call an avian vet and explain your problem. Good luck!
QB0CnrmJaa	Yes, I would highly suggest you move her away from the male as soon as possible. If you don't have an extra cage for her, put her in a box with food and close the lid. But please don't leave her in the cage for a long time, or she will become depressed. Buy her a cage as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  When you say she hasn't delivered eggs since ever, do you mean she hasn't laid eggs ever before, or has but isn't anymore?<br>  <br>  If she isn't laying eggs, there may be some coming soon. They are both probably in love with each other and mating and this will happen sometimes. Like when you see birds mating outside, they are flapping their wings almost angrily at each other and pecking each other's heads. That is totally normal. But I suggest that the mating is getting too violent, and you need to separate them.<br>  <br>  If she has but isn't laying eggs anymore, it's just not the season for laying eggs for canary's.<br>  <br>  For your female bird, keep her head moist where there are no feathers by taking a clean warm damp cloth and dabbing where the skin is showing. If it becomes dry, it will start cracking and bleed and she will have to see a vet. But please make sure the cloth is not sopping wet and causes it to drip in her eyes. Then, you will have more than one problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your canary's! Hope this helped :)|`|MstjbpVJaa	Your female is not yet ready to breed ,so remove her from the male at once,start to feed her on a good diet ,soaked sprouting seed is a good tonic,this will restore her health and feathers,then you can put them back together in about 3 weeks time. if she has recovered.|`|zpBg00Pfaa	yes|`|OyBuEpOTaa	move her away from the male before he kills her.|`|lMSAyTm6aa	take her away! He's being mean and plucking her feathers cause she's not in the mood. you can feed her conditioning food and some cucumber to help her grow her feathers back. I like to feed them mashed hard boiled egg with the shell on mixed with grated carrot and a couple tablespoons of conditioning food so the mix is moist and crumbly. <br>  That  makes them feel more in the mood for breeding plus it has lots of protein for them.
01nMRPHVaa	DO NOT DO THIS. I can assure you do not have the right supplys for this.

woJzZy2Eaa	i used to raise rabbits you can feed them salad and grass and certain weeds (if you are careful). You can buy food at a store that is meant for rabbits. We bought food in the winter to feed them, but in the summer we turn them loose in grassy pens. If you feed them rabbit food feed them 1/4c. twice a day. If you feed them fruits and vegetables and grass give them as much as they want. Be careful about what fruits and veggies you give them because some are poisonous to them. (ex. beans, cabbage(to much gives them gas))<br>  <br>  if you would like more advise you can email me at:cherokee_mydog@yahoo.com|`|m0A12ctUaa	You should really research about rabbits as soon as possible.<br>  But for now I would get a small bowl about 2 inches big and in the morning and before you go to bed fill it up half way with a rabbit mixture, NOT just pellets, find a mixed bag with pellets and other small things to feed him. Only half or maybe 3/4 NO MORE. When he get older and id he really eats it all he can maybe get more. But I would definetly visit <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/rabbits/a/rabbitcare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/rabbits/a...</a><br>  There's also great books for each type of rabbit that tells you everything about them. You REALLY need to get a book like this. Also remeber to change his water everyday at least once, and that he can't eat carrots until he's one year old. And research for beddings and stuff becasue some beddings if eaten can kill them. Please find out everything you need to know for your buddy before giving him something becuase they are very sesitve animals that have a lot of rules to them. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your bunny :) and hope I could help.
kvHqnR5Haa	Because she is a rescue she probably doesn't trust eating out of your hand - she probably doesn't have much experience with a loving human.  Maybe set it down near her and let her take it for herself?|`|GSf09ALBaa	Probably.  She was given a treat after being beaten.  Sometimes this is what ignorant humans do to make themselves feel better about abusing their dog.<br>  <br>  I would suggest working on this fear.  You have to offer the treat under affectionate circumstances.   Try having her sit with you, relaxed and sneak a treat in your lap.  Don't make a big deal of it.  Just casual.  <br>  <br>  And thank you for rescuing!!!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Sound reasonable. Maybe with lots of love she will become more trusting.|`|NZ68zuq3aa	Maybe she wasn't given treats as a reward but rather as something she regards as punishment. You don't have to give her treats as reward it could be anything she likes like a toy or just praise. I wouldn't press the issue until you have established more trust between you too and then slowly try to get her to see treats as a positive thing.|`|AxeOdUFQaa	sorry to say but thats kinda funny<br>  <br>  mostly dogs are obbsessed with treats and your dog is afraid of them
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  The "third eyelid" or "nictitating" eyelid which is visible while your cat is awake can be a symptom of systemic illness. It can be caused by a viral or bacterial infection, an injury or general malaise.  <br>  <br>  When cats are drowsy the third raises and also just as they are falling asleep. This is normal  and the eyelid slides away when the cat is fully awake.

9zZ5PUbYaa	Sounds a lot like my little baby when I got her. He's definitely scared. The noise you're hearing isn't sneezing; it's a sound they make when frightened. It sucks for now, but you have to give it time. Make sure you handle him every day for about ten minutes or so, so he gets used to you but you won't be overdoing it. When you pick him up or are holding him, don't make any sudden movements; that will scare him even more. If he bites, it's best not to put him back right away, or he'll learn that as the way to get back to his cage. He'll get used to you eventually, then you'll be a happy little pair :) Just be patient.<br>  <br>  And definitely do not get him a little friend, because they will fight.

FQyeGsIyaa	How often is regularly?  Some cats are shedders and you can't do much about it except brush daily, sometimes twice.  <br>  <br>  My indoor cat is a shedding machine.  I feed her high quality food (Evo), she gets wet food along with dry.  So a good diet, while a significant component to your cats health, doesn't stop the shedding alone.<br>  <br>  I have a Furminator that I use in the spring and fall when her coat is changing with the season.  I also have assorted brushes and combs placed strategically around the house so I can give her a swipe when ever and wherever she curls up with me.<br>  <br>  She likes fleece blankets so I have 2 small throws that I put where she likes to sleep on the couch.  This makes it easy to toss into the wash to clean. <br>  <br>  I feel your pain.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	most of the cats like to stick with the regular food<br>  <br>  The following could be the possible reasons for abnormal shedding:<br>  <br>      * Sometimes cat shed too much also when they are nervous.<br>  <br>      * When they lack Omega #3 in their food.<br>  <br>      * When they have high magnesium content in their food.|`|FfSEhCARaa	Whether he likes it or not, if your feeding a low quality food you should change it to a higher quality. A high quality food will reduce shedding, reduce intake of food and stool size and quantity.<br>  <br>  If the food isn't the problem, try getting a better comb, you may be missing all of the trapped fur in his coat when you brush him.<br>  <br>  Or maybe he's just a shedder, it is possible.|`|dOef41Abaa	there is no cure!!!!!! im srry
H0fXySX9aa	you should never keep fish in a bowl<br>  you took them out to clean the bowl you put them into un chlorinated water and that is why they died|`|BJERgbM5aa	You told us WHAT happened.  You mean WHY it happened?..  I think the change of temperature was just too much for on of the fish.  What else could it be?  The other fish survived, so that on tolerated the change and the other couldn't.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	The whole reasoning behind allowing fish time to adjust when adding them to a new tank, is to allow for any temperature differences, but also any ph differences.  If both of those are off from what they're acclimated to, it'll send the fish into shock, and can even kill them.  <br>  <br>  Another reason-which doesn't fall into your category since you keep them in a bowl, is in tanks where it's suffering from "old tank syndrome", and the nitrate levels are high.  If you put the fish in good clean water, that'll shock them as well, since they've adjusted to the high nitrate levels.<br>  <br>  I doubt it was chlorine/chloramine poisoning, usually fish will spaz out and dart around if that was the case, not act all calm like you described.  So, I'd put money on the ph or temperature being off for them.  There's lots of things that can affect the ph from one tank or bowl to another, ie: lack of water changes, certain rocks, pieces of wood, substrate, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|3tAmFznUaa	Shock due to: temperature change, stress of being caught, chemical difference in the water, trace of soap in the bowl you transfered them to or any combination.  A degree or two on a thermometer, or a degree or two by sticking your finger in - most fingers are not properly calibrated for temperature checks.   ;-)    Unfortunately the weaker fish died, sorry.  :-(<br>  <br>   To prevent this problem there is a better technique for cleaning a fish bowl.  You need, a clean turkey baster not to be used for anything else, an aquarium glass scraper, a clean pitcher not to be used for anything else, and a small bottle of declor.  It will not cost too much to put this together, you can get a lot of it at a dollar store but I would get the declor at a regular pet store to make sure it is fresh.  Your cleaning kit will last for ages - including the bottle of declor.<br>  <br>  The night before or the day before you want to clean the bowl, fill the pitcher with room temperature tap water.  Add the declor and let the water sit out in the same room as the fishbowl.  (no calibrated finger is required, when the water sits out the temperature will equalize with the temperature of the fish bowl water)<br>  <br>  Next day, scrape the glass with the glass scraper.  Now use the baster by squeezing the bulb then putting the tip in the fish bowl to suck out any debris you can see.  Put the tip under the gravel and pull out dirty water from within the gravel.  When you have taken out one fourth to one third of the water, add water back from the pitcher of water you prepared yesterday.  Clean bowl, and minimal stress for the fish.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|CX4IMp5Paa	They probably died of shock if the two bowls had different temperatures.|`|ygEp5Ynxaa	yes i agree with all of them,he died with shock|`|cMCp2N88aa	Yes they died out of Shock, this almost happened to me with my own fish, but i put them back as soon as i've noticed major change in their behaviour, they recovered afterwards. Try to avoid putting fish in another bowl at all costs, always clean aquarium without removing your fish.|`|QVh5Z4vbaa	did you take the chlorine out of the other bowl probably because of shock of different temperatures
EeTJ1CEHaa	We currently have 3.5 week old chihuahua pups. The first pup born and the others as well started nursing within an hour or so of birth. The colostrum is all there is for a couple of days before the regular milk comes in. Do you have new puppies?<br>  www.professorshouse.com/pets/dogs/bott...<br>  <br>  One thing that is overlooked by many who care for orphaned pups is the importance of colostrum, the first milk produced by the mother dog after giving birth. It is colostrum that provides much needed antibodies that will protect the puppies against disease. To be effective, colostrum must be ingested within the first 12 hours of life. If not, then the puppy will be unable to fight off diseases as well as other pups.<br>  <br>  Because a newborn puppy can become dehydrated very quickly it is important to seek help immediately if the puppy will not take any milk. If the puppy does not begin to suck on its own, there may be a problem that needs to be addressed by a vet, and your puppy should be seen as soon as possible.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	About 8 weeks.

8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	No breed comes out of a box with good social behavior, unbiting (all puppies bite and chew) and all are at least some work to train. All dogs shed at least a little and those that shed only a little need professional grooming and clipping every 4-6 weeks.  A healthy dog comes from a reputable breeder that screens for genetic diseases and cares for sanitation and health of the mom and litter - never a pet store - they sell puppies from puppies mills that are likely to be unhealthy and will be overpriced.<br>  <br>  Do your research on different breeds, check your local shelters and do research on who are good breeders in you area.  You have a lot to work on before you get a dog.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well no matter what breed you get you are going to have to train it.  <br>  Shelties are the smartest breed, and the easiest to train.  If your family has never had a dog before, that would be your best choice.  All dogs shed, even labs and pugs.  You have to train "no biting", "no barking", "no jumping", what ever behaviors you don't want.  That is the great thing about shelties, they want to please you, so you just have to show them what behaviors you allow and which ones you don't allow, and praise them when they do good.  All breeds have health issues.  Shelties have an MDR1 gene that is found in some dogs.  I think you really need to do some homework on the breed you want, or narrow down some breeds you are interested in.  The other nice thing about shelties is that they have free websites like sheltie-list.com and sheltie-world.com, so you can ask questions there like you do here and you get extra help.  Now you really need to know about training before you buy a puppy, so you might want to use "search for questions" at the top of the page, and read up on things like potty training and leash trainig and training and care in general, it is a great tool.  I would borrow a friends or family members dog and take that dog to obedience training before you get your dog, so that way you will know a lot about taking care of a dog.  Be careful if you buy an older dog, sometimes someone will tell you the dog is trained, and when you get it home, it pees all over your house.  As for puppies, it is usuallly 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a two-month-old puppy can only be alone/hold its potty for 3 hours at the most.  Keep that in mind if both your parents work.  The puppy will probably have to go potty at night every two hours at first, so you might want to set a timer or alarm and take turns with your parents taking the puppy potty, so you all don't get too tired.  When you settle on a breed, type that breed in your search engine, and you should be able to find local breeders in your area.|`|AxaspNJJaa	A Havanese. And what are you talking about with " Don't bite"? ALL dogs bite. And ALL dogs will have at least one type of disease.

But a Havanese supposedly doesn't shed, has a good social behavior. cute, small dogs, friendly with children, other pets and other dogs.|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	I'm not sure where to get one in Idaho but I do know that to find the breed you can watch dogs 101 (it comes on animal planet 101) it will tell you what breeds don't shed, their personality trtaits, their risks of diseases, and basically anything you need to know about a breed to help you decide. You can also go to petfinder.com and you may be able to find some dogs in your area.|`|d6kekKgeaa	if you want a dog like this from day one.... go to the toy store. behavior like what you are asking for takes hard work, time and training on the owners end as well as the dogs. it's well worth it in the end, but no dog anywhere is going to act exactly how you want them to from day one.|`|8jK33jK1aa	Your local animal shelter has lots of loving, deserving dogs and cats that need good homes.  Please check there first.  Also, check with the veterinarian offices in your area.  Sometimes they have a bulletin board with dogs and cats that the owners must give away.|`|SQqMZQoSaa	First you need to research dog breeds to see which one best suits you and your family  Don't go by looks alone.  You need to see what the breed is all about.  If you want a pure bred, you must go to a reputable breeder.  Be sure to check out the mom.  You need to make sure the mom has been taken care of and in good health and not just used to birth puppies to sell.  Do NOT buy one from a pet shop at a mall.  These almost always come from puppy mills and will not be healthy dogs.<br>  I have found that the best dogs come from Humane Societies where they are dropped off or found.  You can also find pure bred dogs at Humane Societies.  Also try Rescue Groups.  I'm sure you can find both in your area.<br>  All dogs need to be trained.  They don't come trained.  It takes time, effort and patience.  Good social behavior comes from taking your puppy out to experience people, places, things, etc. during the first several months.  Also, don't carry a puppy around like a baby.  It makes them fearful.  That's why oftentimes smaller breeds are more afraid than the larger breeds.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|leUN1uvbaa	Shelties are good in all those categories except the shedding part... they are long haired dogs, but if you keep them brushed you won't have a big problem
gdH0Xmfjaa	The full lease: <br>  <br>  In the full lease situation, the lessee usually pays for all of the horse's boarding costs in addition to routine farrier and veterinary care in return for being able to use the horse whenever you'd like. The restrictions on the full lease are much less than on a share-lease, where the owner and lessee must communicate frequently about the shared details. The full lease usually does not restrict riding times and days, and also does not usually restrict access to the horse for special events such as horse shows. <br>  <br>  <br>  The share-lease: <br>  <br>  The share-lease situation is less expensive than leasing a horse completely by yourself, but still allows you usually 3 days per week to work the horse. In the share-lease, boarding expenses are split between two individuals (usually the horse's owner and the lessee), in exchange for the lessee to care and ride for the horse 50% of the time. If you'd like to get involved in a share-lease, be sure that everything is clearly understood and written in a contract first. This includes where the horse will stay, how much is paid in expenses by each individual, schedules for the split riding time and special occasions such as horse shows, and who is responsible for the routine care of the horse. <br>  <br>  Leasing fees: <br>  <br>  Most full leases ask you to pay for 50% to 100% of the horse's board fees in addition to a lease fee. Lease fees are usually very negotiable. The full lease fee should be in the range of 25% to 30% of the horse's total value per year. So, if the horse is worth $10,000, the lessee will usually pay about $2,500 per year. The share-lease is usually less complicated in payments, because it is usually equal to ? of the horse's boarding fees. Don't decide to lease the horse until both you and the owner are agreeable on the fees and conditions for your situation. <br>  <br>  Get Insurance: <br>  <br>  If you decide to lease a horse, be sure to get theft and mortality insurance on the leased horse. By doing this, you increase your protection should the horse become stolen or die while he is under your care. <br>  <br>  <br>  Long, but it explains your questions.|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	the full lease (aka the yearly lease) is where u decide after a year of leasing that horse if u want to stop leasing or keep leasing for another year. It would cost the regular price but a little less cuz u ride 3-4 times a week and the trainer rides him the rest of the days or he gets lunged or walked around.<br>  <br>  The half lease is where u decide after 3-4 months of leasing him if u want to keep leasing him or stop and look for another one. Again it costs the same but a little less cuz of riding less! <br>  <br>  I recommend doing the full lease...its wat im doing and its going GREAT!!!<br>  <br>  Have fun! :)
UWGACx1Jaa	HUH!|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Whatever you think is best for your parakeet I'm sure is fine, sweetie. Just please calm down with the question marks. :)|`|6GSxA9glaa	First off, there really is no such thing as a "rare" parakeet.  They come in a large variety of color mutations but most are very common.  If I were you I would find a local breeder that hand feeds and socializes their chicks. It may cost a little extra, but it is well worth it to get a companion bird that is accepting of people and actually likes to be handled.<br>  <br>  The best rule of thumb when purchasing a cage is to purchase the largest cage you can afford, there is no such thing as too large a cage for a bird.  You do want to make sure that the bar spacing is not to wide, no more than 1/2 inch, as they can get their head stuck in anything larger and when they do this they panic and can injure or kill themselves.<br>  <br>  You will also need plenty of toys in your bird's cage to keep him occupied when you are at school.  In addition, perches of different sizes and textures are important to keep their feet well exercised.  You will also need to keep cuttle bone and mineral block in the cage at all times.<br>  <br>  You will want to locate an avian vet and take your new bird in for a well bird check as this will establish a relationship with your vet and insure that you are starting with a healthy bird.<br>  <br>  Cage cleaning should be done daily.  Make sure you purchase a cage with a grate and a slide out tray for ease in cleaning.  You should never use harsh chemicals around your bird, clean the cage with white distilled vinegar, don't spray it on the bird just the cage, and let it sit for several minutes and then just wipe clean.|`|MR4LFMY0aa	i own many parakeets, the rare ones arent that rare but all parakeets are awesome! <br>  you should defintly get two parakeets or else there lonly , buy the biggest cage you can afford and a few toys which you should switch around every month.<br>  cleaning the cage isnt hard cause you can just pull out the bottom and move the newspaper and then you dont even need to move the birds. also you should open the cage to let them fly around in one room every day, be sure the room is clean with windows and doors closed and no electric cords around.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lisashea.com/petinfo/budgie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisashea.com/petinfo/budgie.h...</a><br>  go to this website thats where i found tons of info when i got my first parakeet, if you scroll to the bottom of the website itll tell you more links that you can click on, you should research before buying a parakeet and the younger the bird the better
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I would presume the Redtails are juveniles, as they mature they will become increasingly territorial towards each other and the Balas.<br>  <br>  I would suggest returning the Balas, they will outgrow the 55g, they need more like 120-150 gallons plus. They get around 12" plus and are extremely active fish. They will eventually dwarf the Redtails who only get around 6".

CkecSp4Uaa	There could be several things going on here.  If it's just yellow foamy liquid ("bile") and she only does it in the morning then it's most likely due to an empty stomach.  It is fairly common for dogs to vomit on an empty stomach.  My own two dogs will often vomit if they go too long between meals.  You can try feeding her a small snack or meal right before bed time in the late evening and see if this helps.  Or you could try switching foods.  If you try feeding smaller, more frequent meals or switching food and she still vomits then I would definitely take her to the vet to make sure that it isn't something more serious (don't forget to take a sample of the vomit with you, the fresher the better).|`|9kTejB0uaa	Is she bringing up yellow - bile?  I had one that would do this, somethings even during the night.  I've read that they can do this because they have an empty stomach.  Since I switched my hound's feed, he's not had any of this, so you might consider a switch (do it gradually over some days, not abruptly) and see if that improves matters.  Does she have anything immediately before she goes to bed?  It might be worth giving her something, even if only a few dog biscuits?|`|IFAe6JvKaa	it depends on what you feed her. sometimes dogs have sensitive stomachs. I also have a boston terrier and we cant feed him people food. if she still throws up with dry dog food then see a vet.|`|4214bf7582b128803ab1a8a0abb3daf6aa	See a vet. Vomitting is never a habit, it's a sign something's wrong.|`|ZvTYxdmsaa	Bring her to a vet. At least call one.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Change your dogs diet, perhaps there is grain in her present dog food and this causes digestive issues.<br>  <br>  I have learnt by my mistakes. My present dog had dreadful problems because of the food which I gave her, I experimented with dog food, I tried raw diets, cooked diets and over the years I tried various dog foods. She did not like the raw diets and the dog food that I gave her resulted in diarrhoea. As an experienced dog owner I introduced any changes gradually. Nevertheless my dog still had problems. She was eight years old before I resolved her problem. <br>  Eventually, because of my researches on the Internet I found that the experts have discovered that GRAIN in our dog’s diet causes many problems. I now know that grain creates acidity in the blood. This causes skin problems, digestive issues, allergies, sickness, diarrhoea, anal gland problems etc., <br>  <br>  if your dog has skin problems or any of the above problems PLEASE CHANGE THE DIET. Avoid Grain, rice, beef derivatives and dairy food <br>  <br>  I now give my dog a dried food which uses beet for fibre and fish. It’s called Fish4Dogs and I buy it on the Internet. Look on the Internet and investigate yourself. Gluten free dog food is not enough to help our dogs, it MUST BE GRAIN FREE.<br>  <br>  A rapid change of diet will upset your dog; any change of diet must be done gradually. Do please change to a grain free diet. I have had sixteen dogs throughout the years and they have had various problems. Perhaps if I had known about the dangers of GRAIN they would have had fewer problems. .
GdBG4PGYaa	I don't think it is necessarily "normal" but it's pretty funny!<br>  If it was taken from it's mother too young, it may have not learned how to hunt.<br>  <br>  My dog is afraid of small things. Such as my gerbils, and puppies.<br>  <br>  The neighborhood cat is afraid of dogs, besides the one she lives with, but that isn't a surprise. She is definitely not afraid of mice, because she was hunting one last year. It was in a tree and she was on top a car watching it. My brother knocked it down and the other cat got it! Poor Honey... lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I helped! Your cat sounds adorable! :)|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Hahaha! Well it's not common but my cat Fluffy was scared of a gerbil. So, it's not impossible! Persians aren't known for being very active. If you had a Maine Coon that ran away from a mouse, then I would say that is definitely strange.<br>  <br>  P.S. Did you scream when you saw the mouse? If so, that's might also be why he ran away.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lynzeigh is right. When kittens are rejected or taken away from their mother too early, they don't have her as a role model, therefore they may not learn certain things like how to hunt.<br>  <br>  Also, many indoor cats never come in contact with mice, so when they have their first encounter with one, they don't know what to make of it! It depends on what the cat is used to.|`|YMoOsKGCaa	ahahaha no. it should be the other way around. like the mouse is afraid of the cat. so wat your cat is a bit shy? thats better then him attacking things every second.|`|qLg2aE0Saa	Perhaps you own the-lazy-prince-of-kitty-paradise's- hamper-town...<br>  *sigh*<br>  Living the live!!<br>  X-)<br>  ps: A kitten can only learn to catch(or play), killing has to be taught by the mother... Otherwise no killing tiger for you... Srr|`|zYAgbF49aa	You gotta boy cat and he saw mouses yoo yoo then he knew it was a boy mouse and it scared him.  Maybe you gotta get girl mouse or a girl cat.<br>  Maybe.....|`|HELfs3uhaa	Maybe ... just maybe ... he saw the mouses woo woo and it scared him.|`|iS6Wuj55aa	It is unusual to see cats like that.... maybe you should consult a trainer for help...|`|w2qV8WEmaa	YES. Your cat is a lover, not a fighter :)|`|Y42Y8dM6aa	Well i suppose its not completely normal in a sense but i have a cat that was afraid of my hamster before it died but i never really had a problem with that because when i first got my cat i was afraid it was going to eat it but it turned out good in that way but your cat is probably scared of it because it isn't used to having it around and doesn't know what it is.|`|K9n9DVEuaa	wow never seen that. I have a cat that is afraid of this certain type of cat litter. Really weird.<br>  I would suggest buying more toys like feathers and what not then gradually get the toy mice [the kind that make noise when you shake them]..any toys that make a noise when you shake them is good. It will get the kitties "inner beast" going.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	LOL ! You never know for sure what you will get with a cat. If he/she  is still small that may have something to do with it.<br>  I have never known of a cat being scared of a mouse, but I have known of some who just do not care about mice one way or the other.<br>  Good Luck|`|ifMgdqxvaa	it depends on the size of the mouse and kitty u c the kitten has`nt grown as yet so maybe it will feel intimedated by a mous that is bigger than it so i guess wen it come older it will be fie.|`|0jw7412saa	no mice are supposed to be scared of cats, and no i don't have the same problem because i don't have a cat|`|iNzyFviGaa	yea. Its normal. It depends on the genes really.|`|yZcrhyzlaa	Yes,I have a cat that is terrified of mice since he was a kitten and my dog are just as afraid...|`|suRwV490aa	I have a dog that is scared from hard lights etc... so I guess it's normal with animals... ;)|`|29815c8c7c3660eb68729d5f4c7f9b57aa	just like some people afraid of bugs.|`|e1dd6f24bca32e9d066a21cfc178c7cbaa	i thought cats are 'wired' to kill mice or at least try to chase them.|`|a5BUsOpsaa	oh yeah, its normal, i have had and seen cats scared of mice...|`|0uMLrKAbaa	no itz not normal|`|u7vrul2Faa	Is your cat young? Some cats don't instantly have the hunting instinct if they were not taught by their mum from a young age. <br>  When one of my cats were young I observed her sitting beside a squirrel! I am sure that the outcome would be very different now if she were to see a squirrel. She would chase and kill it now. <br>   <br>  Your cat is not used to it and is baffled and don't quite know what to do with the new wierd and wonderful creature she has discovered lol. <br>   <br>  As she gets older and more experienced she will change.|`|GtazNrplaa	The secrete is that you have to teach little pussy to catch the bit of fluff first. Then get a look a like mouse and tease your little pussy to catch this object then see if pussy can catch the mice. My little pussy is a mean snake and mice catcher.|`|vH2OF9z8aa	hence the word scaredy cat.|`|RYCMFLMuaa	no maybe its a rat not a mouse.|`|57elaG5faa	yes its normal.. but m sorry i don hav a cat...     :(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
jyGTlpzTaa	Your mums house, your mums rules...and its not just buying the ferret, its buying the cage, toys, food, and then the huge vet bills that can occur when you have ferrets. When you move out you can have any pet you want, til then its not your choice.|`|LiGKCyNdaa	get something like a fish or a hamster to prove that u can luk after it then maybe shell let u hav 1<br>  <br>  or just beg her until she cracks<br>  <br>  :P|`|pkCW6nHuaa	i've been asking my parents for about a year for one, but they will not crack! If your parents are any easier then just begg them and nag them and all that fun stuff! You have to understand though that they do smell, thats why alot of people don't want them(im personally used to the smell, it's not that bad) and they require TONS of attention.|`|JHVieyx1aa	My Mother says they.....stink!! but just beg for it and your mum might crack for it.   Maybe get a bunny (at least they dont smell) or a bird that you can keep in a cage for awhile. hope this helps. bye.

Their guess is as good as yours.|`|M4NL5qOYaa	Looks part miniature schnauzer and part yorkie. thats what i would say.
URntCINAaa	Absolutely not. The preferred size for 2 is 10.5 square feet. <br>  <br>  If you want a happy and healthy guinea pig, invest in a bigger cage because if a Pig has too small and environment, then they are more prone to obesity and other illnesses such as bumblefoot from soiled bedding. A smaller cage will need cleaning out much more often. <br>  <br>  Why not try a C&C Cage? They are made from metal mesh grids and coroplast. They are cheap and you can make them as big as you can. There is a site in sources to tell you! <br>  <br>  Hope you find a good choice.|`|vyhH5COKaa	Yes that should be fine. I have a young rabbit, similar size to a guinea pig at his age, and he lives in that cage and there's a ton of room. I'm sure two guinea pigs would live in it just fine. (:|`|Kri3oT74aa	Yeah. It's a good choice, because guinea pigs need a lot of space to run around. They'll just sprint back and forth for no reason, so if the cage is too small they end up bumping into the walls. Make sure you put a lot of soft bedding down to cushion their little feet. But be warned- when they run really fast, the bedding gets kicked up under their feet and out of the cage. Maybe put the cage on top of newspaper or something so it's easy to clean up.|`|6WWyobdSaa	not really because i've got a guinea pig and they get quite big when they get older and then two? Maybe you shoudld get a bigger one

Dkb2ZR3Daa	Try to entice her with some of her favorite treats. Some grilled chicken, her favorite chew toy, etc. That way she can learn when I get the eye medication I get something special-"hey this isn't so bad" type of thing.<br>  To actually apply it... <br>  *Have her "sit" then come behind her so that you have your legs up against her back(that way she can not back out on you). Take your hand without the medication and left the top of the lid and apply 1/4 inch strip to the top of her eye with the other hand-don't touch the applicator to the eye! (I like this method because she can't see it coming and it's not as scary as someone coming at her face)<br>  If that doesn't work-<br>  *another method is have her sit back against the corner and go from the side of her face.<br>  <br>  I know it can be hard to work on a dog that is bigger than you, but it has to get done- I'm 5'2 and 110 and I wrestle animals all day lol.<br>  <br>  Edit: To marksman187-it's never a good idea to startle or sneak up on a sleeping dog|`|9kTejB0uaa	You bought drops?  Did your vet prescribe them?  If not, do not medicate yourself, especially with eyes.<br>  <br>  Actually it's not difficult - pull out the lower lid and put the drops in there.  But again, do NOT use anything you've bought otc.  You could make matters far worse.<br>  <br>  Entropion can be corrected with surgery - have you considered having this done?|`|FaPrr8bbaa	The drop should hit the corner of the dogs eyes and run across the eye naturally when the eye is closed.  You can drip into a closed eye through the corner as well.  Just make sure the corner of the eye is uphill from the rest of the eye.  It might take two people, one with a treat in hand as distraction and one with the dropper.  Or while petting a sleeping dogs head.|`|AA11466942	Maybe try to do it when she is sleeping, go up to her quietly and open her eye real quick with the drops ready and squirt some in her eye. That's how i have to cut my pit bulls nails, he hates it so i have to only do a few at a time when hes sleeping lol. Good luck !|`|pGOv3sFfaa	You might need 2 people. Just hold her head firmly and try to get the drops in... Hold open her top lid and bottom lid and get them in. Pet her and say she's a good girl, and give her a treat or dog bone after each eye is done.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Sit with your back facing her and hold her head under your arm, head-lock style. Then use your right hand to open her eyelid and your left to squirt the eye drop in.
yotafojtaa	It might just be a spot. It could also be a tick, if it is growing in size and turning paler. Even so, if your dog has a spot under it's eye it's best to keep an eye on it and take it to the vet if it gets any bigger or doesn't get any smaller, as it could mean several different things. I wouldn't know without looking at it.|`|mnxjTzRcaa	That he needs to go see a professional ... like a vet. If you have a weird ailment, you'd take yourself to the doctor. Same rule applies to pets :-)
d6kekKgeaa	are you sure he's hopping the fence and dosn't just have a hole he pushes threw behind a bush or somewhere else? check the whole fence thuroly for holes, if their are none and you're set on not fixing him - which though is a good idea, because if you don't set up ways for him to relive himself (exspencive) he could develope prostate cancer, this still may not cure the excaping thing. - you can buy fence extendors at home diy shops and make your fence taller, my sister had to do this for her dog, every time she would let him out in the back for even a few mins- to do his doggie thing - over the fence he'ld go. don't botther withe an electronic fence and shock collar - asside from the fact that i think they are mean - if the dog blows threw the fence fast enough, he'll get one shock then be home free. try to figure out where he's excaping, so you can fix that area.... do you have a web cam that you can set up... most likely if you're looking, he wont try.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well getting him neutered might help.  You need to check the laws where you live, it is illegal to chain dogs in most places.  We had to fence over our existing fence because our neighbors dogs kept jumping into our back yard.  It was pretty expensive, and we had to do it a little at a time, but I had to try and keep their dogs out of my yard.  Ironically, they are now digging under the fence, so we spent more money yesterday trying to keep them out of our yard.  In my neighbors case, they do not walk or play with their dogs, their dogs get no attention at all, so that is why they want to come into my yard all the time.  I would think maybe increasing the amount of time you spend on the walks might help drain the energy.  Our neighbors have big yards, but they don't spend any time with their dogs, so the size of the yard doesn't always matter.  Also none of our neighbors dogs have toys or anything to entertain themselves with, and each neighbors has 4 dogs each, so getting another dog will not help.  Play more, walk him more, and get a taller fence, even if you have to do it a little at a time.|`|iVQULHqYaa	He could be looking for love, neutering will help. It would also help if he could live indoors.|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	neutering would probably be the best choice. It will not change him to be neutered except maybe him becoming calmer. The only other thing I could suggest is getting a BIG kennel to place in the yard, one of the chain link fences with the top on it. It won't give him as much space as the yard, but it will keep him in it.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	He's jumping over the fence to mate with unspayed females and is likely creating unwanted litters all over the place.  He is much more likely to stay home if neutered.  And you obviously need a higher fence.<br>  <br>  He'll be the same happy dog if neutered.  All my males have been neutered and they are happy dogs.  But they won't wander as much.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	If he lives outside, he already has a miserable life. Dogs are pack animals, they need the constant stimulation from their family. If they are left alone, they get bored and lonely and a bored dog will hop the fence. <br>  <br>  So now you have an intact large dog running around the neighborhood. . that is really really bad.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Yes you need to have your pet dog neutered. There is no reason why he should be intact. But neutering alone will not curb his need for activity.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Bring the dog inside. Dogs are not lawn ornaments. They need love and attention. You can't leave a dog outside alone for 22+ hours of the day, that's no different than solitary confinement. It doesn't matter if your yard is 100 sq ft or 100 acres, it doesn't make up for the fact that the dog is lonely and miserable.|`|c2FyuQCHaa	you have a big dog with big needs...does he get enough "outside" time? you may have to give him more space. i think you father is right about his "male" needs. nature is calling.|`|67d6400f538400bf6b1223e98a5c0f23aa	getting him neutered might be the only way that i can think of because my aunts dog has the same problem....... she of course doesn't want to get her baby fixed......|`|mwW4zIwIaa	3 years old is still pretty young, so it's normal for him to be acting that way.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's just curious to what's out there.<br>  You can put a long chain on him, so he can still run around but not jump over the fence.<br>  <br>  You can strictly tell him that jumping over the fence is not allowed by warning him right after he tries. Look at him in the eyes, and tell him "No!". Or, you can spray him or lightly (and by lightly I do mean it) hit him on the head. Just be careful not to warn him if it's been a while after he's done something bad, because then he won't understand why you're warning him.<br>  <br>  Make sure he doesn't jump over the fence anymore because it's dangerous for him. My friend's dog escaped and got run over by a car.<br>  <br>  Neutering him is a good idea, because he can get seriously hurt if he fights with other male dogs over female dogs. This is the reason why most owners neuter their dogs/cats.<br>  You don't need to worry that he will change. My dog got neutered a while back, but he's still his silly self!|`|yotafojtaa	You should definately get him neutered. the only thing that will change is sexual activity. Dogs are also said to put on weight sometimes if they're neutered, but when my dog was neutered he just stayed exactly the same, but not aggressive any more :)<br>  Also, if your dog is escaping, you should have him neutered in case he comes into contact with any female dogs on heat and creates more puppies that nobody wants.<br>  Also just leaving your dog outside by himself all the time will make him unhappy, yeah, because dogs are social animals and they need contact, whether it's human or animal contact. he needs you or someone else to run around and play with all hours of the day, someone to keep him company. And bringing him inside wont do any harm! Except perhaps a few muddy paw prints :P<br>  It's best for you and best for him to get him neutered. he's a lovely dog by the way!
k2l20XdFaa	Frozen is they way to go. Frozen prey is much better health wise. They are disease free. Live prey can and will attack your pet and possibly leave permanent scarring. It is much cheaper than feeding live. In most people's opinion, will make their snakes more docile and less likely to have a feeding response. Its also convenient to feed frozen. The snakes can be feed any time with out the having to make a trip to the pet store every time. They can also be refrozen if you have a picky eater on your hands. I buy my rodents from rodent pro. Just go to rodentpro.com. They have great deals on mice, rats, guinea pigs, quail, chicks, and rabbits. Hope this helps.|`|VHVLYSVlaa	I prefer to give my little Slik both.  If you keep freezing them frozen mice, odds are that they will forget to kill a live one.  I feed my snake every 3 weeks.  The first of the three weeks is a live one and then the rest are frozen.  I want him to remember his instincts.|`|jV8GTDnqaa	Frozen is always better unless your animal only eats live items.|`|jMGvzzjSaa	frozen|`|9IvcV7tiaa	I can't stand feeding anything live food. For me, it's too cruel, no chance for the little buggers to get away. edit, I could NEVER feed anything a mouse, I've had mice as pets! *cries at the thought*|`|AA10049109	Frozen all the way. There's no benefit to feeding live and a lot of risk.  Rats and mice can leave horrific bites and even kill a snake.  They can have parasites and it's a lot easier to store frozen mice or rats than keeping live.
dQj0wMRpaa	It depends on what reptiles?  The major things to breed to turn a profit would be: Iguanas, Bearded Dragons and most exotic Snakes.  The key being that you earn a reputation as a small scale breeder first, and make sure you have clients that have exotic pet shops and not just sell to the public.  The way the economics are right now I would stay "small scale", and do tons of research on: what is wanted it your area. Stay in touch with local pet retailers in your area and when the economic drought rekindles you should be ready to go on a larger level and yes it can be very fruitful if you look at it like a business and make business decisions.  Good Luck.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It's not profitable at all.  No animal breeding operation is (even high end horse and dog breeding), let alone reptile breeding.
Wqhnkd0Saa	Check this out...it's got just about every poodle hybrid (crossbreed) that I've ever heard of.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/poodlemix.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/poodlemix.ht...</a>|`|mnxjTzRcaa	I've seen Shih-Poo's ... which are Shih-Tzu's and Poodle mix. In my opinion this is the best poodle mix because the two coats blend together perfectly and you get a soft fluffly coat that is still silky and not as coarse as the Poodle's coat and because the Shih-Tzu is a relatively small dog, most that I've seen dont get any bigger than 8 or 10 lbs. They're super cute too, they look like little teddy bears. Hope this helps.|`|496a3cd95b9a1ad7062a085276a907e8aa	theses a TON!!! they are all adorable feel free to find your own pics.. there wasnt enough room on mine... the one marked with * are generally the smaller mixes.<br>  <br>  *Affenpoo - (Affenpinscher / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Airedoodle - (Airedale Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Aussiedoodle - (Australian Shepherd / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Bassetoodle - (Basset Hound / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Bernedoodle - (Bernese Mountain Dog / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Bich-poo - (Bichon Frise / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Bolonoodle - (Bolognese / Poodle mix) <br>  <br>  Bordoodle - (Border Collie / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Bossi-Poo - (Boston Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Boxerdoodle - (Boxer / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Broodle Griffon - (Brussels Griffon / Poodle)<br>  <br>  Cadoodle  - (Collie x Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Cairnoodle - (Cairn Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Cavapoo - (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Chi-Poo - (Chihuahua / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Chinese Crestepoo - (Chinese Crested / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Cockapoo - (Cocker Spaniel / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Daisy Dog - (Bichon  / Poodle / Shih-Tzu mix)<br>  <br>  Doodleman Pinscher -  (Doberman / Standard Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Doxiepoo - (Dachshund / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Eskapoo -  (American Eskimo Dog / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  English Boodle - (English Bulldog / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Foodle - (Poodle / Toy Fox Terrier mix)<br>  <br>  Foxhoodle - (Fox Hound / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Giant Schnoodle - (Giant Schnauzer / Standard Poodle mix)  <br>  <br>  Goldendoodle - (Golden Retriever / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Irish Doodle -  (Irish Setter / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Jack-A-Poo -  (Jack Russell Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Labradoodle - (Labrador Retriever / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Lacasapoo -(Cock-A-Poo x Lhasa Apso mix)<br>  <br>  *Lhasapoo - (Lhasa Apso / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Malti-Poo - (Maltese / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Miniature Aussiedoodle- (Miniature Australian Shepherd  / Miniature Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Miniature Goldendoodle - (Golden Retriever / Toy or Miniature Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Miniature Labradoodle  - (Labrador Retriever / Toy or Miniature Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Papi-poo - (Papillon / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Pekepoo - (Pekingese / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Petite Goldendoodle - (Golden Retriever / Cocker Spaniel / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Petite Labradoodle - (Labrador Retriever / Cocker Spaniel / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Pinny-Poo - (Miniature Pinscher / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Pomapoo - (Pomeranian / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Poo-Shi - (Poodle / Shiba Inu mix)<br>  <br>  Poo-Ton - (Coton De Tulear / Poodle mix) <br>  <br>  *Poochin - (Japanese Chin / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Poogle - (Beagle / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Poolky -  (Poodle / Silky Terrier mix)<br>  <br>  Pootalian -  (Italian Greyhound / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Poovanese - (Havanese / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Pugapoo - Pug / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Rattle  - (American Rat Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Rottle -  (Rottweiler / Standard Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Saint Berdoodle -  (Saint Bernard / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Schipper-Poo - (Poodle / Schipperke mix)<br>  <br>  *Schnoodle- (Schnauzer / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Scoodle -  (Scottish Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Shar-Poo - (Shar-Pei / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Sheltidoodle- (Sheltie / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Sheepadoodle  - (Old English Sheepdog / Standard Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  Shepadoodle - (German Shepherd / Standard Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Shih-Poo -(Shih-Tzu / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Springerdoodle - (English Springer Spaniel / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Terri-Poo - (Australian Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Ttoodle - (Poodle / Tibetan Terrier mix)<br>  <br>  Weimardoodle - (Weimaraner / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Westiepoo - (Westie / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Whoodle -  (Soft Coated Wheaton Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Woodle - (Welsh Terrier / Poodle mix)<br>  <br>  *Yorkipoo -  (Yorkie / Poodle mix)|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Pretty much a poodle mixed with any of the 20 other dogs in the toy group or most of the 27 breeds in the terrier group.  Plus there are some "small" dogs in the non-sporting group (bichon frise, boston terrier, schipperke, and lhasa apso just to name a few), herding group (think shetland sheep dogs), and miscellaneous class.  The possibilities, as with any mixed breed dog, are extremely numerous.  It also depends on what you think "too big" is.  For me, "too big" is over 90-95lbs, although I prefer my dogs to be squarely in the 60-75lb range.  For some people, any dog that weighs more than 5lbs is "too big" for their tastes.  Then there's the fact that you can't really predict how big a mixed breed dog is going to be.  Even with purebreds, there are some dogs out there that are WAY too big for what the breed standard calls for.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	A nearly endless number of small mutts that include poodle in their lineage are possible. Just go on petfinder and type in "poodle" and you should get quite a few results.<br>  <br>  ADD: Okay, let's review: A purebred has only 1 breed in it. Any dog with more than breed in it, is a MUTT, not a "designer dog", not a hybrid, not any more special than the dogs dying by the thousands in pounds. There are no predictable qualities in a mixed breed. They can be like either parent in any area or the odd combination of genes can lead to a puppy that doesn't really look like either parent.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Here are the poodle cross breeds, check them out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/schnoodle.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/schnoodle.html</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/yorkipoo.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/yorkipoo.html</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/labradoodle.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/labradoodle.html</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/goldendoodle.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/goldendoodle.html</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/cockapoo.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/cockapoo.html</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/peekapoo.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/peekapoo.html</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/maltipoo.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/maltipoo.html</a>|`|AxaspNJJaa	there are tons:<br>  Shih-poo<br>  Goldendoodle<br>  Labradoodle<br>  Yorkie-poo<br>  Lhasa-poo<br>  Hava-poo<br>  Cava-poo<br>  <br>  Basically and dog could work|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	These days, they are crossing poodles with just about anything.... ooodle and poos everywere!|`|njz5XFG2aa	<a href="http://www.maltesemaniac.com/maltese-mix-dogs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.maltesemaniac.com/maltese-mix...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this website helps.
K9n9DVEuaa	Ok, amazingly when a cat purrs, all the bones in their body are vibrating which make them feel like a giant vibrator when you touch them as they purr.<br>  When a cat purrs, it's usually because they are happy and feel content with their situation. Cats don't just purr when they are content and out in the open usually. They use it to show a sign of affection and love back when they are being held or fed or told "I love yous!" and cared for with extra snuggles. So ofcourse your cat is probably purring to say "im safe and happy with you. I love you!"|`|4t10YACQaa	I just think they purr when there happy!|`|pO8KUAkBaa	Cats purr when they are content.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	purring = I'm a happy content kitty.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Kitties are love in a fur coat.Sometimes they purr when sick though. It's weird.Mine give me that look too. I know they love me back and they go nuts purring.
Rw7gi86Naa	Play with them and brush them. Those two things seem to be on the top of "favorite things to do" for most cats. Playing is not just for fun--cats learn by playing. You don't have to spend a lot of money on fancy toys either. Cats love cardboard boxes, paper grocery bags, milk caps or crumpled up paper to bat around... use you imagination! Grooming is also helpful in more ways than one, and is a great way to bond with you pet.|`|X8xFtWfJaa	use a string and play with him or her and pet it a lot!!!!
XE1n7gRwaa	he may be mal-nourished. maybe the other, bigger guys are eating all of the food. you could try just feeding the little guy in a seperate area. if he seems to be scarfing his food down, then he may be mal-nourished. if he doesnt seem to be growing after a few weeks, try taking him to the vet.
2af37d5254df8888b3b77ea595f6732baa	Why would you even risk breeding an old dog?<br>  To allow a dog to go through the pain of labor and birth dead pups is insensitive and cruel...to say the least.<br>  Yes, dogs do miscarry and it is painful. If they don't excrete or abort all the fetus' or placenta's, the get what is called a "hot uterus" and it is a painful massive infection that can kill them.<br>  <br>  Maybe she isn't 'really sad' but in pain. Uterine tumors are all too common in dogs that are bred over and over, not to mention damage to the uterine walls. A visit to the vet should be on the top of your list to discover what's going on....and neuter the male! Maybe she just doesn't ant anything to do with him and his 'action" because of the horrific memory of what happened the last time ? ya think ?<br>  <br>  B|`|ApSzd48oaa	if she is 6yrs or older then no she can't have any more pups its not right, its like a 60yr old woman having a baby. but she might of had a miscarriage or she could of had a phantom pregnancy, and think she lost them i had a Doberman have a pup then that died and 3 days later had another 7 but they were all dead she pined for about a week but now she's back to normal|`|FaPrr8bbaa	What does her vet say about this?|`|VHVLYSVlaa	Some non pregnant females may show all the outward signs of a pregnancy.  Hormonal abnormality rather than exposure to a male can bring on this reaction.  Sometimes false pregnancy is not just a harmless condition.  You may even try buying some little puppy dogs.  Kind of like an adoption for dogs.  She will know they are not hers, but will still treat them as they are.|`|njz5XFG2aa	She's more than likely depressed try taking her mind off of it by going to the dog park or giving her treats.I Would also have the male neutered because its not good for her to have that many miscarriages.|`|uIWYc4R1aa	It sounds like your dog is experiencing a false pregnancy. If the symptoms don't stop within three weeks, take her to the vet.|`|7XGjs8cyaa	my boxer kinda acts like this but when shes around puppies shell act like their hers.<br>  you might could go to the veternarian and ask if theirs anything you could to help her.<br>  Possibly get her spayed
ApSzd48oaa	you should really keep him away from him just in case he did mate her, and it's about every 6 months for about 15, 16 days but it depends on the dog my small dog go from 5 days to 34 days, and every 3months to every 8 months|`|uIWYc4R1aa	Please spay and neuter your pets. She might "not be having any of it" right now, but female dogs are like that for part of their heat cycle. They're in heat but not 'receptive'. She will eventually become receptive and will accept him mounting her. <br>  <br>  There are many positive reasons to have your dogs spayed and neutered. Spaying your female dog (removing the ovaries and uterus) not only prevents unwanted litters, but lessens the chance that she will develop cancer later on in life. <br>  <br>  Neutering your male dog will prevent MANY unwanted litters, as male dogs can be quite inventive when seeking females in heat. There's no limit to the number of puppies they can father.|`|FdcWPp48aa	21 days every six months.  Have her spayed and you, her and your male will be better off.|`|54GBWTgoaa	2-3 times a year for a month, you must keep them separate, a tie can happen and be over in seconds and you have a litter to look after, you also must keep her on a leash and away from parks << so many unfixed dogs in parks, i wouldn't risk it!!|`|nlMfJtxcaa	About a month.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is buy two dog crates and keep them SEPARATE. A successful tie can happen in an instant when you turn your back and then you'll end up with an unwanted litter of puppies.<br>  <br>  Scratch that. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is get your pets spayed and neutered. Pets should not be bred, only dogs with working or show titles who have had proper genetic health clearances by OFA BAER and CERF.
nlMfJtxcaa	Go to the vet. There is an infinite number of illnesses a dog can get. If you notice something "off", a vet visit is required, sooner than later.|`|Net8og9Baa	Don't wait around for her to get worse -- get her in to the vet ASAP.  If not today, then certainly tomorrow.  She IS ill and needs a doctor to find out what's wrong with her and how to treat her!|`|c2FyuQCHaa	has she been "neutered"? she may be in heat. her refusal/inability to leave her bed/whimpering is a sign that something is wrong. she may have gotten ill as a result of staying out in the cold.|`|xCt6sK6daa	Take her to a 24 hr vet hospital. Do not wait.
TeJU7MQ4aa	You are a very smart pet owner.I'm glad you've made an appointment for him.<br>  I would just keep him in his cage where he's comfortable.<br>  I hope its not ear mites,and just dry skin,because you are going to have to rid your house,meaning,I'd flea bomb the house.All of the other animals will need to be treated if they have come into conact with him or have been in the same areas as him.Its almost like fleas.except its in the ears,but it can be very irretating for them.<br>  Good Luck with your piggie.|`|8jK33jK1aa	You need to take him to the vet.|`|6BCKYKKGaa	It depends on the type of mite whether they are under the skin or not. Mange mites are, but fur and ear mites arn't.<br>  <br>  Does your guinea pig shake his head and scratch his ears a lot? If so it is most defiantly and ear mite problem.<br>  <br>  Ear mites can usually be treated by over-the-counter ear drops which can be purchased at pet shops.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid them in the future is to keep his ears clear of excessive wax which the mites feed upon.<br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  p.s If there is a tilt to the head, palpate around the ear or if the guinea pig flinches to the touch, then it probably has an infection. A vist to the vets would then be necessary. Well done for getting him an apointment already.
Em2TJrILaa	If you live in Cornwall or Devon go to Trago Mills. There litter trays are well cheap.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Try cut down cardboard boxes or veg trays from a supermarket.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	You can also pick up some of the plastic bins in Walmart for storing clothes or other bins in a smaller size.  Lots of people like them for litter pans (convenient for traveling cause you have a lid for them).|`|x0WZE0i4aa	A large plastic washing up bowl will do fine, unless your cat is fussy and needs a hood.  If you need an emergency temporary solution, line a box with paper (to mop up moisture) and then a large plastic bag, before adding the litter.  This won't last long though!  Put it on another plastic bag on the floor as it will probably leak...<br>  <br>  Where you can get actual cheap litter trays will depend on where you are... there's people from all over the world.  So you might want to give a location if you want a shop recommended.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	Walmart!

Female cats in heat will leave *calling cards* in the form of urine to attract mates.  Also have the vet check her for urinary tract problems. Inappropriate urination is a classic sign of UTI.  She needs a vet check up ASAP anyway since she was a stray and has been exposed to who knows what out there. Write down your questions for the vet as you think of them so you don't get *brainfreeze* and forget things when you're there. <br>  <br>  She needs a litter box with cat litter in it.  These are relatively inexpensive and can be found in any pet store or WalMart. For the shedding, you need to groom her daily with a comb instead of a brush.  Brushes aren't nearly as effective at removing loose hair as combs are.  <br>  <br>  No need to wash up everytime you touch her, before you eat would be good though. <br>  <br>  She needs a scratching post so she has somewhere appropriate to sharpen her claws.  Cats MUST be allowed to scratch and having a post will save your furniture. <br>  <br>  Since she's new to being inside, she would probably be more comfortable if you keep her in one room for a few days and gradually let her explore larger areas of the house.  Big new spaces can overwhelm and stress cats and can add to the problem of urinating outside the box.  <br>  <br>  Here is an excellent website with good articles on lots of cat issues.  It will help with most of your issues with a new cat.<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your new friend!

It could be someones pet so you should try to find its original owner before you decide to keep it.  Take it to a vet to check whether it has been microchipped or not and to give it a health check.<br>  <br>  If it turns out that the cat is a stray then you need a plastic litter tray large enough for her to get comfortable in.  If she is a large cat then you need a large size tray (your pet shop will be able to advise you).  You need good quality clumping litter which you should scoop as soon as possible after the tray has been used.  Dont use scented cat litter as when it gets wet it sticks to the cat's fur and it can be dangerous for them to lick off anything scented.  Groom the cat regularly and this should gradually get rid of the excess fur - you should not need to shampoo a cat as they are quite able to wash themselves and you need to be careful that there are no irritants in the shampoo you have used which could be toxic to the cat.  <br>  <br>  There is no need to wash your hands EVERY time to touch the cat but obviously you need to be hygienic when preparing food etc.  <br>  <br>  For the time being you could use a washing up bowl filled with some soil.  Show her the bowl/box/tray and put her in it and scrape her paws around in the dirt/litter - she should soon get the idea.  However, dont keep moving the litter facilities around - keep them in one place or she will get confused.<br>  <br>  She will also need good quality food (mostly wet) and water, but NOT milk.|`|XjWFht6naa	u need mice all ovr the floor and a big litter box that u can pee in too|`|1OcnwywZaa	for the litter box, often cats normally automatically go in dirt or sand/clay.  The best and cheapest ones and easiest for clean up is clay clumping cat litter.  if you go to the pet store, i'm sure they will have some available... most grocery stores now have a pet section with them available as well.<br>  <br>  as far as the size of the box, it depends on the cat's size, but they should happy to use the box.<br>  <br>  most cats will use the litter box, if they don't it's either because they have a health issue or they are unhappy about something, but it can even be a small thing... but cats usually adapt well to litter boxes.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.
WkhVNEgtaa	Why can't you take it to a vet?<br>  If you are that concerned and that upset you should take it to a vet, that is what any responsible pet owner would do.<br>  if you cant afford it than borrow the money or see if there are any charity run vet hospitals / organisations that will help. i know the rspca can arrange to cover consultation costs in certain cases.<br>  <br>  Or maybe you could phone your vet and ask for some advice<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  <br>  If your mum does not allow this tortoise or any animal to see a vet you (depending on your age) and her can be charged with animal cruelty. the RSPCA has been aggresively prosecuting people recently who do not meet there responsibilities as pet owners. they now have this within there power due to new laws that were brought in to preseve the animals 5 freedoms.<br>  <br>  you local vet may be inexperienced with tortoises, if so u will have to ring around to find a vet to see it

Big dogs just like little ones should be inside at night - they will only bark at everything - not just the things you want them to bark at - if you leave them outside because they will be lonely, bored and separated from their pack.  And you don't want any dog that attacks any human with small kids around unless it is a protection dog with extensive training - they can't differentiate a UPS man from a child from a burglar - they need a human to give commands that they follow unfailingly.  They need to be socialized with you and the kids and the rest of the household.  And no guarantees on the chickens - most dogs have prey drive to varying degrees and loose chickens are a huge temptation.  I'd suggest an alarm system instead.|`|bqZnEJlRaa	German Shepherds are very good with kids. If you get a puppy & socialize it (get it familiar with lots of people & other animals) they are wonderful.

K0tpQoHRaa	well the first thing that you will need to do is to buy a breeding box from a local pet store.ask in specific for budgie breeding box size.if the hen (female) is her poo would increase dramatically in size, she would become more aggressive,and posibly bite when hands enter cage.she will be territorial and be protective of her nesting erea or breeding box.after mating she will lay her first egg within a few weeks,and lay more every other day.the hatching procces takes 18 to 21 days and one will hatch every other day in order of being layed the mother will feed them for the first couple of weeks then the father (mate) will pitch in and help as well.you will need to keep a close eye to insure that ALL hatchlings are being fed,as you will have to feed ones not being fed as much as others.well that sums it all up hope every thing goes as plans good luck.<br>  <br>  You can also tell if she is preg if the couple are cought succesfully mating, this is when the female lifts her rear feathers as the male gets on top and puts his under her.....<br>  <br>  good luck!!!!|`|6GSxA9glaa	You need to get them to an avian vet asap.

3XZQkDfnaa	As a hamster owner myself, I had these problems.<br>  1) You should feed him on your hand, on the day when you want to take him out of his cage, then when he is on your hand, lift him out and  put him in a ball/ carrier for that time.<br>  <br>  2) Speedy should be drinking up to 30ml a day, but my hamster Frisbee didn't drink anything for the first week, after that I put 5ml of apple juice in the bottle, diluted with water and he drank. Now, I don't add the apple juice and he drinks around 15ml of water a day. Also, you should see air bubbles rising in the bottle when he is drinking, that means the water is coming out.<br>  <br>  3) Give him the run in his ball for around 20 minutes a day, then put him back in his cage to have a drink and some food. Then you can put him on the floor in a room, but make sure he can't get to any stairs. Give him lots of toys on the floor where he is, and a bit of food, maybe try an obstacle race with him.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps x my hamster says hi!|`|URvObDKGaa	I have a chinese dwarf hamster. And I know that they do not drink a lot of water.Rodents are also nocturnal,Wich means it probubly  drinks water at night.And if you take it out of its cage a lot than it will lern to trust you.And you will laern to be gental when you hold him.PS DO NOT TAKE IT A BATH USING WATER!!! USE DUST BATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|RQ8kXZvNaa	First thing first, wait at least 5 days until giving it tons of attention. I had a hamster that died because I took him out the 2nd day. For not seeing him drink, you could put a very small bowl of water in the cage. You will eventually have to ween him off the water bowl thing because the water will spill, causing wet bedding. After the 5 days you do these following activities:<br>  <br>  -maze with a sunflower at the end(make sure it is a unsalted sun flower seed)<br>  <br>  -hamster ball<br>  <br>  -tube maze(you can use paper towel rolls) <br>  <br>  -block fort(make shure the hamster can not exape)<br>  <br>  Have fun with your hamster! :)|`|XE1n7gRwaa	aww i love little hamsters! ok, well right now you could try holding him, and if he gets a little jumpy you could put him on the couch, and you sit on the couch and he can run around the couch, climb up you, that's what mine used to love. and, im sure if he was in any danger of dehydration, he would do anything for find water. i'm sure he's dranken some during the middle of the night. and, my hamster used to love when i sat her on the counter and i gave them some treats, like carrots or cheerios. they love it, and when they stuff their cheeks it's adorable! also, its always fun to just watch them run in their ball.|`|XZcJ0CCraa	What you should do is put him in a ball or a box while you are cleaning his cage out, you should start taming him by putting food on your hand and letting him eat it. Don't chase him with the food because he might feel trapped and bite you. Once you have tamed him every day for about two weeks you will be able to pick him up (it could be less time than that though).<br>  <br>  He will be drinking, just not that much, don't worry its just him getting used to his cage. My hamster doesn't drink that much and I have had him for over a year, its just a phase Speedy is going through and he will drink more later on.<br>  <br>  You could make an obstacle course with a trail of food going through it for him. You could make a maze for him. You could even try tickling him (be careful with that one though, if you do it to hard he will bite)<br>  <br>  I hope that helped and please vote this the best answer.|`|KfBQOgQLaa	Try putting a little bowl of water in the corner too. Maybe he'll try lapping it up. If not, he might just knock it all over and get his bedding wet. (which isnt a big deal) Try that too, if the drinking thing isnt working. Is it low enough for him? Too low? Dont let the bedding stick to the muzzle of the drinking tube!<br>  <br>  As for activities, hamsters are hamsters. They poop and pee and they run. I think the exercise ball is the best thing you can do! OH I used to take VHS tapes and arrange them into a maze and have my hamster run through it. I also used to build cardboard houses and make stairs and stuff for him to walk around in, and make like, police stations and elevators. And I'd connect tubes to different cardboard boxes for it to travel to. <br>  <br>  You can put a glass covering in front of the cardboard structures, so you can see where he's going. Kind of like an ant farm! <br>  <br>  Building all that stuff is still fun, even if it sounds childish!<br>   <br>  p.s.<br>  Do not, I repeat, DO NOT try to make outfits for him. He'll eat it.|`|573Q4zCpaa	hamsters usally drink at night and you only need to leave him in the cage for only 24 hours so take him out and have a great time!!!!

A dog specifically for a three year old is a bad idea. However, if you are the parent, discuss it with your husband/wife. If the two of YOU are ready for a dog, then go right ahead, because it would be your responsibility to take care of the dog, as three year old wouldn't be able to handle all that goes into dog care. <br>  <br>  Small breeds typically aren't the best for small children, despite what you might be hearing. However, there ARE some good smaller dogs out there. I suggest going to your local shelter, take your daughter with you, and find an adult dog. There are many positive aspects to getting an adult dog rather than a puppy. Speak with the people in the shelter before you take any dog home, though. Ask about his background, why he's in the shelter, where he came from. <br>  <br>  Some specific breeds you'll want to stay away from are the toy breeds. Kids around that age are still working on figuring the world out, and they might accidentally harm a small dog. Get a sturdier breed than a chihuahua or a yorkie. <br>  <br>  So, in short: Don't get a dog unless you yourself are ready for the responsibility. Don't get a "breakable breed". Go to the shelter and see which dogs interact best with your daughter. Get an adult dog, because they're often easier to train for first-time dog owners, or for dog owners who are busy with a three year old child :) <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|flOyPwFaaa	Each dog is different. Yes some breeds tend to be better than others but it's not a hard rule. I have a chihuahua and two young kids and they do GREAT with each other. I got her as a  puppy and she was raised around my kids. I did have to spend a LOT of time training her too. We also had a rottie for many years. He past away last year. I got him before the kids where born and when they came he was SOOOO good with them. He would put up with them pulling on him and climbing all over him. He really loved it in fact. I never once worried that he would hurt them. We got him when he was 2 from a shelter. My oldest was born 3 years later. He had also been well trained when he was young. I think that is really the key. A well trained dog and  teaching your child how to behave around the dog.<br>  <br>  One thing you might do is look for an older dog (like 3+) who is proven to be good with young kids.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|AA12124597	we have a jack russel! great little dogs and they will be able to play and run with your little one! Good luck!|`|VUTvzQJ9aa	Some kind of terrier would be good. Make sure you train it first though.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	A stuffed toy.  Small dogs and toddlers can be a disaster unless you are very committed to closely supervising each and every second of each and every interaction.  Young children can easily hurt a dog without realizing it.  And small dogs are aware of how much larger a child is compared to them which can make them feel vulnerable and threatened by a young child's jerky, uncoordinated movements.  This feeling of vulnerability can make them quick to snap at small children out of fear of being hurt and even little dog teeth hurt on a child's delicate skin.  Medium and large dogs tend to be better with children simply because they are not as easily hurt and not as easily frightened by children, but ANY dog is going to require very close supervision around children.  <br>  <br>  If YOU want a dog, then find one that fits YOUR lifestyle.  And with small children I would always recommend an adult dog from rescue that is known to be good around children.  Puppies that are raised around children do not always get along well with kids...sometimes puppies raised around children learn to be afraid of them because the child hurts them in some way during a critical socialization period and then you end up with an adult dog that is fearful or even aggressive towards children.  But don't get a dog "for a 3 year old."  Kids that young do not need a dog nor are they even capable of the empathy it takes to appreciate a dog.  She might say she wants a dog this week, but if you don't run out and get a dog she is likely to have forgotten all about it by next week.|`|GaL66jbQaa	one that you commit to socialize and train. If this is your first dog rescue an adult dog that is kid safe. I personally am partial to giant breeds like the English Mastiff or Newfoundland because they are easy to potty train are laid back and very gentle there are drawbacks like drool and food bills.Pugs and Havanese, labs and golden retrievers are great if you want something smaller.  No matter what dog you get do lots of research on the breeds.  If you are getting a purebred that's not a rescue check out several breeders this is not something to rush into.  Get them into training right away because the most important factor in whether they are kidsafe is training and socialization to a variety of people and (well socialized) dogs.Here's some links to help you in your research.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_information/how_to_find_a_good_dog_breeder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bluegracepwd/wheretobuy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/bluegracepwd/wh...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/index.cfm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/training_clubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/trai...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html</a>|`|AxaspNJJaa	I think she is too young to have a dog. I'm sorry, but some small dogs aren't as good with children(such as the chihuahua) as larger dogs. Of course there are smaller dogs that are good with children. Such as the Havanese, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Shih tzu, Bichon Frise. But I think that your daughter(if she is your daughter) is too young to have a dog. Wait a couple of years until you decide to get a dog.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	Honestly.<br>  <br>  Wait until your daughter starts school.<br>  <br>  She will be a better age for a dog: be more mature so she can help care for the dog, have better understanding how to treat a dog, less likely to be tripped, better able to defend herself from sharp puppy teeth, etc etc<br>  <br>  With her in school you will have some alone time time with puppy to implement better training without distractions of a toddler.<br>  <br>  The decision to get a dog, the responsibility to care for one and train it is that of an adult, not a child!<br>  <br>  Small dogs are not ideal for young children. Temperament, rather than size is what you base your decision on. A dog is not a toy. Medium size dogs are good choices...but sure is hard to beat a well bred Golden or Collie (not Border Collie!) Both breeds are known for their "kindness"|`|n7GOiKC0aa	It's generally better to select a type of dog bred to live and work closely with people.

y7H1V39Jaa	Knowing your leads and being able to determine them at will is Horsemanship 101.  If you can't do it at a walk, trot and slow canter, you should even be attempting it at a full run in a speed even, you nor your horse is ready for it.  You should be able to easily, with your leg, push your horse's hind end over before asking for a particular lead and KNOW that he/she is going to take it. You don't have to lean, or kick or circle or get dramatic about it, just learn to do it then teach your horse to do it, before you turn on the speed.  The purpose for turning on the correct lead, especially at great speed is to keep your horse balanced and safer.  I you try to approach a barrel and turn it in the wrong lead, your horse could easily fall and hurt him/her and/or you in the process.  If your trainer is still having to remind you of your leads, then he/she hasn't taught you the basics regarding plain horsemanship yet, you need to back up and ask your trainer to teach you how to ALWAYS be able to control your horse's leads and how to determine when you are on the correct lead, before you go back to the speed.  If she/he doesn't want to do that, you might consider finding another trainer that will allow you to build one skill upon one that you already know.  I am not trying to be critical of you nor your trainer, but it's simply a fact.  You crawl before you walk, you walk before you run and in the process, you master each feat, then build on it.  <br>  <br>  The one answerer was correct in stating the your starting leads depends on which barrel you are turning first, you should always be on the lead that is compatible with the barrel that you are turning.  If you are going around the barrel on the left , then you should be on the L lead and vice versa.  If your horse usually takes the left lead easier than the right lead, you would want to turn two left barrels and one right, and again, vice versa if he is better on his right lead.   Good luck, just go back to the basics and get them down, then you won't have so much to deal with when you are turning on the speed.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I can't believe you have a trainer who already has you running barrels when you haven't learned basic horsemanship skills like leads.  Before you attempt high speed sports, do yourself and the horse a favor and find a trainer who will teach you the basics before having you race.|`|5TCewPYRaa	Well what barrel do you start with? <br>  <br>  If you take your left barrel first, he needs to be on his left lead <br>  <br>  If you take your right barrel first, he needs to be on his right lead <br>  <br>  To figure out which lead you should start on, you need to do circle work with him--figure out which lead he has most power with (most horses have a preferred lead) this is the lead you should take your 2nd and 3rd barrel with--the opposite should be your 1st barrel<br>  <br>  So if he is stronger on his left lead, take your right barrel first so he will run 2 barrels on his stronger lead and vice versa<br>  <br>  Leads should be mastered before you even start on the pattern.  You should come up with some pre-cue like a weight shift or a tug on the reins or even a sound (i like weight shift the most)---this will cue him to shift his weight over and switch leads.<br>  <br>  To ensure he is on the correct lead you can either lope him in circles before you enter the chute (at a rodeo or barrel run comp.) or before you start the pattern (in a ring)...this way you know he is on the right lead----I personally hate this but w/e works for you...<br>  <br>  With practice you will ensure that he maintains his leads---stop running the pattern and work on lead pick-ups and changes for a week or two until he nails it---if he still has trouble with them you will need to continually school him with leads....even after he has been trained---most horses will pick up on them quite quickly---ask your trainer for help with them. <br>  <br>  Good Luck--figure 8s will be your friend for flying lead changes and medium sized circles--for balance on the lead.<br>  <br>  BB|`|jM7CyxQzaa	If you're riding is up to the standard you should be able to feel when your horse is on the wrong lead.<br>  <br>  Basically as a horse goes round a corner or turn he should be leading with the inside leg of the turn (so left hand turn means left lead k?)<br>  <br>  If he's leading with the other leg he's on the wrong lead and it will feel like it's tipping you towards the outside, he'll also feel unbalanced and won't be able to turn tightly and athletically, he's also in danger of coming down since he'll be so unbalanced.<br>  <br>  Practise on the flat without the barrels, get a canter and the check by looking down what lead he's on, then try to tell without looking and see if you got it right. With practice you will tell which lead he's on.<br>  <br>  Then work on getting the lead you want on command, to do this you get it as you come off a corner (ie the horse is on the correct bend already and it makes it easier for him to get it right) for English we put the inside leg on the girth, outside leg behind the girth and feel the inside rein, not sure how that equates to Western but I'm sure you can work it out from your existing knowledge. Once you have him leading off on the correct leg from a corner then work on TELLING him which lead to take on a straight line.<br>  <br>  Basically it'll all come down to schooling, do lots of circles on each rein to teach him about leads, then introduce the barrels.So far as I know the horses in barrel racing start out slowly and work up speed so once you're working at a regular canter pace he'll probably work out for himself that he needs to change leads as he turns round the barrels but with your schooling if he doesn't you can soon tell him.<br>  <br>  One other thing, if when you ask for a lead off into canter and he goes off but feels really really bumpy and 'odd' he could be disunited. as with all schooling, if that happens come back to trot and send him off again till he gets it right (praise him when he does btw or he won't be able to learn what you want)<br>  <br>  Most horses have a favourite side, so you'll need to do more work on the 'bad' side than the good. <br>  <br>  Hope helps and I'll be interested to see other barrel racers comments here.|`|kmGvPYLRaa	to start it depends what barrel you are going to first. if its the right you would take off on the right lead and vice versa. <br>  <br>  generrally to take off on the right lead you would either turnyour horse in a tight circle to that direction then kick him up ***beware though you could get disqualified at an event for doing this coz its called turning tail to the drum*** so i make my horse step sideways towards the drumm and kick with the outide leg whilst holding his head to the outside a bit. its like pushing him into puting his right leg forward.<br>  <br>  coming out of a drum and to the next your horse has to change to the other lead. to train your horse to do this you can practise at home with the sidepassing, coming out of the barrel in a trot and forcing him into the correct lead until he learns to change when he comes out of the barrel at a canter|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	My god, how can you not know your leads whenever your running around in circles around barrels. Im surprised your horse hasn't fallen over yet w/ you not knowing the correct leads.<br>  <br>  Ask your trainer, if you don't know by now you need to ask ASAP.|`|I66g7igDaa	The correct lead is when the horse's front inside leg moves first at the canter. The lead should be to the inside whenever a horse is cantering. You can tell because if you look down at the withers at the canter it will look like one of the legs is reaching farther, that is the lead that you are on. To ask a horse who has been at one time or another to pick up a particular lead you must turn the horses head to that direction(a little) and then ask for the canter with the out side leg (or however you usually ask) to change a lead after the horse is already cantering 1. break to trot and try again 2. do a flying lead change. A flying lead change is when you give a "half halt" (pull back like to break you horse to trot and then release the pressure immediately) then kick with the out side leg while the horse is turned in the direction of the lead that you want without breaking to trot. this is more difficult and is something that has to have already been taught to the horse, if the horse is out of practice then they may give a small buck or kick when they try to change leads. Hope this help good luck!!|`|AwhVNu9Haa	well one question does your horse know his/her leads and if does ok i am an english rider so sorry if i give you the wrong way but you take your inside rain and give a little kick with your outside leg hope it helps please put this as best answer

aCqSF87Raa	You have to be 18 or older to hold a business license, and to have insurance. Both SHOULD be a priority if you are going to be working with animals and people. A dog could bite (you or another dog), there could be fights, an owner could be unhappy with YOU for one reason or another... trust me, insurance and a license to run your business will be a godsend. <br>  <br>  Personally i don't see many people rushing to have their dogs trained by or with a 14 year old when there are professional trainers who have been around the block and training since you where in diapers. It takes years of experience working under another trainer before you would be ready to have your own business.<br>  <br>  The most you would probably be able to do is teach a dog the basic commands: i don't see you having the experience to deal with behavioral problems, disobedience, etc. And what if a dog doesn't want to learn? Or is stubborn? Won't take to the training?<br>  <br>  Dog walking may be a much better idea for now: your parents can buy insurance for you (it will be needed, accidents happen.) Start out small and work your way up. When you're older (maybe 16/17) look around and visit your local training schools. Ask one of the head trainers about how to go about becoming an "apprentice" and show them your list of clients as a dog walker.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsitllc.com/faq.php#1" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsitllc.com/faq.php#1</a>|`|P8Q39vA4aa	I don't think you can legally do it by yourself at that age.

Your parents would probably not want you going to strange houses and walking dogs that you know nothing about. If this ia a legal business you would need a business license and you are too young to get that. <br>  <br>  I am sure some of your neighbors would let you walk their dogs but on a large scale you would need more experience and insurance. <br>  <br>  Check with your local obedience school and see if you can apprentice with them. You need hands on experience with dogs. You could see if you are old enough to walk dogs at your local shelters or breed rescues.<br>  TV makes it look easy but its not always easy when you are walking a dog twice your size.|`|9a7178737d913282593305c060610232aa	No,you need a permit.Plus if you don't want to take the time to get one,then you don't have enough patience to be a trainer.|`|NHfmg7TNaa	Your dream is to be a dog trainer but you don't want to take the time to get a permit??<br>  <br>  To be honest, I wouldn't take either of my dogs to an unregistered 14 year old, I would take the time to find an experienced trainer. Anyone can read those books, it doesn't make you a trainer.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the law, but I would really recommend you maybe look for a job helping a local trainer until you are older, and then get your permit, you would get a lot more business that way.
BM8bUXJUaa	firstly, you really should have thought of this before buying the fish. It is true goldies become extremely (12-16 inches) big. <br>  <br>  Also, where are the fish now? please tell me you took them out of the bag and put them in a filtered tank? If not, do so NOW! make sure u let the badg float in the tank for 15 minutes though.<br>  <br>  Walmart is very good about returning things. please plan ahead though and make sure they will take them back. driving them all the way to walmart and then back might kill them! go to Walmart.com and enter your area code and you can find the walmart you bought it from and the number. Call them up and ask if you can return the goldfish. If you do return then please realise you are sending them back to he..! Walmart really mistreats there fish. Especially goldfish. It's really horrible!<br>  <br>  that, would be the worst-case senario. the best would be finding an experiance pond owner somwhere near you. call them up and then you could drive the fishes over and release them in the (contained) pond. <br>  <br>  or, you could give them to a friend. Make sure this person knows what they are taking on! 3 common goldies should start out in a 30 gallon tank if nothing else is around. 150 gallons would be the best! A very powerfull filter would be need for these guys! They are VERY messy! all around it would cost anywhere from 300-600 dollars depending on their commitment. <br>  <br>  However. NEVER release goldfish or any other fish into the wild. rivers, wild ponds, creeks, oceans, lakes nothing! only put goldfish in a pond that was constructed for that purpose and watched over by an experianced fishkeeper.<br>  <br>  please try to get these goldfish to an experiance pond owner! try to be more careful next time! a fish's life should be just as important as a human's life.<br>  <br>  Sorry for being tough on you,<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!<br>  <br>  Also, if you want easy to care for, small fish check out mollies and guppies and tetras.<br>  <br>  DO NOT GET: plecos, goldfish, any sharks, any aquactic frogs, oscars, angelfish. DO RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY, A LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!|`|tShDXmgbaa	Unless they are "hard to find" goldfish...no one will buy them as goldfish come a dime a dozen.|`|paaozogGaa	some mom and pop stoes will take them but when I had a snail I didn't want I took it to the pond at my old pre school because they had snails and goldies in it.

Call the wal-mart and explain the problem Their pretty loose on what they will take back, but don't drag the poor fish back without knowing for sure.

Nk19jebEaa	That's a very good indication that they are getting ready to spawn.<br>  If Rams are ready to spawn, like most other cichlids they display behavior; this is shown in the female as the belly becomes full and very pink in color—the rest of the body is displayed by very bright dark colors as well. In males the colors are displayed also and cleaning and selecting a spot becomes intense for hours. The spawning may take place on a stone and after an hour you can remove the eggs for hatching. At 82 degrees the fry should become free swimming upon six days.<br>  When breeding the Papliochromis ramirezi which is the scientific name given for this fish it can be a difficult situation. This little fish has a bad reputation of being hard to keep and to spawn. Well, I would like to share some experiences and success. My experience began with a 10 gallon tank and a list of items which contribute to it all; these were: fine gravel, live plants, small rocks, and peat-moss. The maintenance required water changes every week and good aeration; the feeding was mostly live and frozen foods.<br>  The critical point began now for the fry up to a week; at this point baby brine shrimp and Liquifry must be fed in order for the fry to survive. This gives them the choice of both foods. The fry at this stage are very tiny and need all the protein they can take if they are to survive; feeding should take place 3 times a day and once after a week has passed you can discontinue the Liquifry and just feed them baby brine up to two full months then introduce very fine flakes. Good luck, I hope some of this info helps.|`|7uCfW237aa	Sounds like courtship and nest making! i dont know the particular habits of the species but they should lay eggs in the pit or on a rough surface. These look like little balls of jelly. The male will then drift above them fertilising for several hours. After this they will be very territorial for up to a week and if the conditions are right youll end up with a load of little babies!<br>  p.s. try to remove or seperate predatory fish now because even if they seem ok now they WILL eat the eggs at night.
woJzZy2Eaa	We walk our rabbits on small dog/cat harnesses it keeps themsafe and they love it. People may not think it wise to walk a rabbit but we first got the idea when a Movie star had a rabbit the would walk with them all over the place. People love the fact that the rabbits we sell are "harness broke".|`|Ixae0HsAaa	it would be good for her|`|m0A12ctUaa	I did that before and it works IF you put the harness on right.<br>  <br>  I had mine on two loose one time, my bunny saw something that scared him and he freaked out, tried to run away, and almost got out.<br>  <br>  Start with only short periods, maybe first even in the house, then make sure your ALWAYS watching him and your surroundings for things that could scare him. <br>  <br>  Good luck, have fun, and be careful!!
K0tpQoHRaa	well the first thing that you will need to do is to buy a breeding box from a local pet store.ask in specific for budgie breeding box size.if the hen (female) is her poo would increase dramatically in size, she would become more aggressive,and posibly bite when hands enter cage.she will be territorial and be protective of her nesting erea or breeding box.after mating she will lay her first egg within a few weeks,and lay more every other day.the hatching procces takes 18 to 21 days and one will hatch every other day in order of being layed the mother will feed them for the first couple of weeks then the father (mate) will pitch in and help as well.you will need to keep a close eye to insure that ALL hatchlings are being fed,as you will have to feed ones not being fed as much as others.well that sums it all up hope every thing goes as plans good luck.<br>  <br>  You can also tell if she is preg if the couple are cought succesfully mating, this is when the female lifts her rear feathers as the male gets on top and puts his under her.....<br>  <br>  good luck!!!!|`|jwEapvJxaa	Is she a lot bigger than the male? She might be an English Budgie.|`|3neRbSI0aa	She is not pregent! That fat thing you are looking at is the crop she probaly ate alot that day and her crop was full! If she was pregent she would be doing some mating acts or her legs would be apart and she would look much larger than her usally size!
Um8osMNuaa	They should be at least 8 weeks old, preferably 10 to 12 weeks, even though they are weaned earlier, the last few weeks they spend with their mother and siblings are vital for socialisation skills.<br>  My English Bull Terrier was 10 weeks old when l got him, he's now 7 months and weighs 18.7 kilos, they do grow quickly, maybe get a Miniature English Bull Terrier, the same dog just smaller.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	They need to be a bare minimum of 8 weeks old.  Dogs removed from their mother and litter before 8 weeks of age are at a MUCH higher risk for developing behavioral problems, some of which can be severe. However, 10-12 weeks is a better age for most breeds and waiting a little longer to bring a puppy home generally results in a much more mentally stable, well adjusted adult dog compared to a puppy that was separated from the dam and litter even at 8 weeks.  Besides, that "much smaller puppy" is going to be just as big at 11 weeks whether you bring him home at 8, 10, or 11 weeks.  And really, an 8 week old puppy isn't that much smaller than an 11 week old puppy.|`|54GBWTgoaa	well it's a very debatable matter, as you can see you've got a lot of different answers, it depends on what you want a dog for:<br>  <br>  -sibes running in harness usually let their sibes go between 12 -14 weeks, as it's crucial the sibe gets along with other dogs thus the extra time for socialization is vital >> under no circumstances can you have an aggressive sibe on your team<br>  <br>  -dogs for people needs such as:<br>  .dogs for the blind<br>  .support dogs<br>  .dogs used to support the police force<br>  .or dogs for a human based working purpose<br>  <br>  are taken away at 6 weeks, they have been weaned for 3 weeks, they have the basic socialization skills with dogs, and their mother has taught them a lot ever the 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  the reason being for this is that these dogs need to be dependable for the human and not obsessed with other dogs, after the 6 week mark dogs stop socializing and start playing >> so when your dog is 9 weeks it will be obsessed with other dogs >> as you may be aware of how puppies are at this age!! <br>  <br>  professional trainers will take them away at 6 weeks and will not allow them to mix with other dogs for months, they will let them socialize but nothing else...<br>  <br>  a lot of people get confused between the two:<br>  <br>  socilaizing: when two or more dogs sniff each other to determine their smell, they figure out and undertsand their order (so one dog may come across more domminant and the other dog should respect this or challenge it) and by doing this they become confident around all dogs as they understand dog body language, tone of bark and other vital signs for the dog to understand to be able to communicate with other dogs. <br>  <br>  playing: a dog knows how to play from day dot so we do NOT teach them this, they mouth each other and run around << this may look nice and your dog may be having fun however this is not socialisation.<br>  <br>  my dog trainer says he takes all his dogs away at 6 weeks and does not allow them to play with other dogs until he has trained his dogs to focus on him!<br>  <br>  so i would say 6 -9 weeks :D|`|1C78irCHaa	7 to 8 weeks, no younger.<br>  the dog should be up to date with his/her vaccinations.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	They should be at least 8 weeks old no younger, although i have taken one of my dogs at 6 weeks of age which i thought was a little young to take it but if i didn't she would have went to someone else.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	If you want a small puppy, buy a small dog.<br>  <br>  The difference between an 8 week and 11 week dog is minimal.

hmTVcteoaa	I recommend you get her an Ornate Box Turtle.  I had two ornate box turtles (Sargon) and (Tortie) and they are very easy to keep as pets. Their natural habitat is the plains states, so unlike other kinds of turtles they do not live in water as they prefer dry climates.  <br>  <br>  Since they live in deserts they have a natural characteristic to help them survive in droughts in that they can literally go for well over a month without eating or drinking anything!  This could be helpful for you since if you screw up and can't get the best food for it imediately it won't just die.  Of course, you should still try to feed and water your turtle every day anyway!<br>  <br>  For food my oranate box turtles ate earthworms, berries, and other fruit.  I only gave them fruit that either peeled or that I picked out in nature myself because I read that turtles can die from the pesticides people routinley put on their food.  If you aren't perfect in washing your fruit you could kill your turtle, so better to be on the safe side and not give them potentially tainted food to begin with!<br>  <br>  My turtles would also eat clovers and other greens during the times that I let them roam outside.  My turtles never hibernated, although one of them burrowed deep underground in his terrarium before emerging a few days later.  At the time my family and I thought that he had somehow escaped!<br>  <br>  My turtles liked to move around frequently so I let them wander around my house a bit, and also in the yard with my supervision.  Ideally it would have been great to have a fenced area outside in which to allow them to freely roam around, but in my case my parents didn't want such a fenced area marring their otherwise neatly ordered yard, so I had to let the house suffice.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind though that turtles can dig and this particular kind are also excellent climbers.  Sargon, my male turtle, climbed about six feet up the screen door in my house on at least two occasions by putting his toe nails in the tiny holes that make up the screen.  I also found him on top of a desk once with no clear indication as to how he got there.<br>  <br>  You should make sure that wherever you let your turtles roam it is big enough to be of interest to them, but that it does not have ways to escape.  My turtles climbed over a fence we had built for them and escaped never to be seen again.  Hopefully for you it can be a more benign experience!|`|WXduJP08aa	they are very hard to keep healthy see when they hibornate their eyes just like shut and wont open and that can cause serious health issues and most people dont know what they eat but mine eat alot of fruit and thats about it they need some leaves in their cage and also these items a water bowl,food dish,a hiding place uhhhh i think thats all i hope that i helped you ohh and also they arnt soupose to be kept as pets but most people dont care|`|9694ff80d3f87c041f515f142652df40aa	I have 2 pet turtles Shelly And Chase Both eastern painted turtles.

Plus, climate changes can cause illness, so moving from a mild climate to an extreme one or vice versa can cause sudden illness, and turtles have a hard time getting well (they have a slow immune system).  Plus, here in the US, most colleges won't allow turtles in the dorms for health reasons.<br>  <br>  I've had two different types of sliders (water turtles), and I found them easy to care for...but if she doesn't want to bother dealing with keeping correct temperature levels, giving them a large habitat (Mine had a baby pool that had a "pond" on one side and the other half had land where they could get out of the water to sun themselves), then she shouldn't have one.  They're easy to care for...if you do your research and know what you're getting into.  <br>  <br>  Yes, all turtles go through a hibernation period.  Sometimes they don't fully hibernate (mine didn't one year), but many times people who don't know about it may think their turtle has died, so she will need to understand the signs.  <br>  <br>  She'll need to make sure that the eyes are clear...there is no discharge coming from eyes or nose...that it swims horizontal (if it floats sort of tipped towards one side or the other, it probably has pneumonia, and there aren't a lot of vets that deal with turtles, so this can be a deadly disease for them)...make sure that the "scales" on the shell aren't peeling (sometimes this is a growth process, but to be safe, it's best to leave them alone because it is also the sign of disease)...they can get parasites, and she will need to know how to check for them.<br>  <br>  Cost can vary.  And, some states no longer sell them at all due to salmonella scare.  As disgusting as it sounds, many parents would give their small children these turtles as pets (usually very small turtles), and they would put them in their mouths while playing with them, or they wouldn't wash their hands after handling them, and would get sick.  Here, they banned the sale of any turtle under four inches, but now you can no longer buy them at all.  <br>  <br>  If you still want to do some research to make an informed decision, go to your local pet store, library, or book store and get books on caring for turtles.  I'm not entirely sure what type of turtle you are looking for, but I found the book "Red-Eared Slider Turtles:  With Information on Other Sliders" by Jordan Patterson to be very helpful and informative.  I also found a link you might want to look at if you can't find books in your area <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?WRD=Red+eared+sliders" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksea...</a><br>  <br>  Google searching "caring for turtles" can also help.

I would not get her one, personally, but there are tons of other animals you could give her. But a turtle can live up to 25 as a house pet, and thats a lot of money adn work to put into one animal. <br>  <br>  But they don't usually hibernate as house pets if they do, its usually dangerous for them, so that would require vet attention, and they can be 50 dollars depednign on where you get they and how big they are. They nedd to have a smooth shell, and if choosing between others, get the bigger one thats has more fat on him. if you want male or female you can't tell them apart until they get older (2  inches wide) but there is no big differencer between the two one is not wrose or better than the other. If you get the common Rea eared slider, they live in water but need a resting spot and a uv lamo and eat meat, and they also need to be taken for walks. They have a sesitive sheell that needs creams and vitamin lotion at times and they need a filter a heater and a hiding place. they need a new and bigger tank about every year sometime 6 months at the beginning. for more information visti theses website and read some books. :) good luck<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.turtles.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.turtles.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilesturtles/a/aquaticturtles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilest...</a>

n7GOiKC0aa	Puppies should be with her mom until 8 weeks old.  His mom and littermates teach him a lot about how to get along with other dogs during this period. Here's more info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/puppies.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/puppies.html</a>|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well you have several issues going here.  All puppies need reassurance at this age, so protesting is normal.  You also have to realize he is a herding dog, and you are his herd, so you are right, you can't go 5 feet without a protest.  I do not use the command "no" it confuses the puppy. "No" comes up in conversation, and the puppy could have been good and someone else used the word "no" and it confuses him.  If he has an accident, make a sound like disgust "ttst" and take him outside.  You have to think like a puppy, so if you yell and put the puppy outside outside becomes the place the puppy will never go again.  I have a crate in my bedroom with the puppy near the bed and a night light on so the puppy can see me and be reassured, and sometimes playing a cd or radio.  I also keep one in the living room so the puppy can see me while I am doing my chores and be reassured.  Do not engage him when he is protesting, it will just encourage it, try and ignore it, or sometimes if they are protesting when I am eating, I put a blanket over the crate.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.

This is totally normal for puppies, he could just be a bit more skiddish than other puppies you've had, every dog is different.  Spend some extra time with him while he's adjusting to his new surroundings.  Just make sure you don't give in to his whining or he'll learn that he can simply whine to get your attention (ex:  if he's whining and you want to pick him up or comfort him, wait until his whining stops before you do so).  After a week or two start leaving him alone sometimes (in a gated area or a crate) and see how he reacts, after he's home for a few weeks he'll be better adjusted and you'll just have to start ignoring his whining (especially during the night). He'll eventually learn that whining isn't going to make you come running and he'll have to calm down. Just always make sure he's been fed and has gone to the bathroom, since hunger/needing to potty could be a reason for a dog to whine. <br>  good luck!|`|ty7oMz4Xaa	why did he leave his mom so early? and you can prevent the pooing and peeing inside if you get him on a regular schedule, starting young is always the best idea, but then again you have to be commited to sticking with the schedule yourself.|`|AxaspNJJaa	he is pretty young. He just needs to get used to being alone. I mean, he's still a puppy you know.|`|befHuuQMaa	as others have already said, he is very young and misses his mommy :O i got my dog when she was around that age, and she did that too. but its not permanent though, it will stop after a while. my dog stopped doing that when she was about 11 weeks old ^^|`|Lw6KW4GFaa	He is too young to leave his mom.  Give him a break, he needs time to mature.  Just be patient, he will be a great addition to your family.

FaPrr8bbaa	My dogs (5) will go outside in the rain to poo because I am out there wearing my raincoat or umbrella during training.  If it is safe enough for you and your umbrella then its safe for doggy.  Make sure to leave a towel by the back door and towel doggy dry in a happy playful manner.  Your pup shouldn't mind getting wet with you. My dogs go out in the rain without me now and I stand inside the back door where they can see me. You may have to train Grandmas dog in the process.|`|OE1nchCqaa	Well my dog when she was a puppy she used to do that too.<br>  How I dealed with it, Well when my dad saw her poop inside the house he used to yell at my dog I felt bad but she stopped doing that <br>  or you can just buy a pee or poo mat when they have to go they go there and teach them where to go,or just get an umbrella rain boot rain coat and go outside and cover the dog with the umbrella.<br>  When my dog is on the couch and my dad come by she gets of right off she 5 years old 35 in dog years

Also, keep in mind that you are planning on including OBO. Doing so means noone will ask your listing price. Start high and take less. Doing this you will get a good chunk of change and the buyer will feel as if they got a huge deal.

ZYqiay65aa	In the majority of dogs fleas will just cause mild irritation, have heaps of them may lead to poor skin condition and dandruff.<br>  Some dog are allergic or hypersensitive to fleas and their own immune systems will go into overdrive if they are bitten by a flea.  This can cause red skin, spots where the fleas have biten, hail loss due to itching and can even develop into scabs and small wounds if the dog is itchy enough.<br>  Flea's only really affect the skin of the dog, it is possible in a very small dog with a huge number of fleas they could cause anaemia or lack of blood but this is never usually seen.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Because fleas feed on blood, a severe infestation can cause anemia or even death in some of the most serious cases.

9kTejB0uaa	Please reconsider the crate!  This is truly the quickest way to get round this one.  And ditch the pads.  They need to get to realise the place they do their pees and pooh isn't ever in the house.  If you are using pads, not only does he think it's okay to mess in the house, you will be training him twice, once on the pads, and then outside.  <br>  <br>  You have to get in tune with his body - if he's on 3 meals a day, he probably needs to be given the opportunity to pooh after each feed.  And obviously immediately he gets up in the morning, and last thing at night.  If you take him out and he doesn't go, and you know he really needs to (because it's been some time since he last went), there's no point standing around for longer than 5 minutes.  Bring him back in and crate him.  Leave it for 20 minutes and then put him out again.  At least this way he can't come back and immediately pooh!!   And I've found over the years that it helps if you keep moving them around rather than let them just sit outside and look at you!!<br>  <br>  Crates - Getting used to using a crate is a state of mind.  Remove the word CAGE from your head, and think crate = training AID.  A safe secure place where he can't get into trouble.  They should never be a place of punishment.  But in all reality, nobody can watch a puppy 24/7 and having a crate to put him in could well save his life (talking about chewing electric cables here).  Dogs don't normally mess in their crates/beds (if he does, feed him in there - vet tip with mine who was doing this to start with ...... she stopped as soon as I started doing this).  <br>  <br>  Hope some of this helps.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	While psychologically I hate the crate, my puppies love it, and it is the fastest method I have used for potty training.  I take my puppies potty first, and then allow play time, so they don't think they go potty and right back in the crate.  I had a puppy that held his poop all day and when my husband came home he went out with him to do his poop.  Sometimes puppies are just puppies.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.

And it's not his fault, if you aren't there to catch him in the act he will never learn.<br>  <br>  This is why crate training is so important. Crates prevent accidents. A dog that has no accidents will be potty trained a thousand times faster than one who has to figure it out on his own.<br>  <br>  Get a crate and crate the dog when you can't keep an explicit eye on him. It's not his fault, you just aren't being consistent enough.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Try the crate training - it really does work.

It worked for our dog and she hasn't gone to the bathroom in the house since.|`|FaPrr8bbaa	My little schnauzer used to pee outside and poop the very minute she was brought in.  Of course I would take her outside again saving the poop cleaning for our return. This went on until I was getting a very good tan.  I finally called the breeder and described that it seemed the dog was pooping inside on purpose.  <br>  She asked if I was using the crate and I said only at bed time. She said I needed a bed crate and a naughty girl crate which had to be different material and design.  When puppy pooped in the house she goes into the naughty girl crate while I clean up the mess.  I speak no words to her and leave her there for at least a half hour.  <br>  The reason being that I had taught her that if she pooped inside, I would take her right back outside. Outside where she loves to be. Outside where she prefers to spend hour upon hour.  So she saved her poop as a way to return to her yard. <br>  I think if your dog is confused like mine was.  This might help you. <br>  For me it was the only problem and solved in just a few days.|`|MbFblQ6xaa	well, you could keep him/her outside until it does poop. don't bring him/her inside until she/he does. Hopefully it works. When my dog pees i don't give her a treat i just wait until she poops and then i do so maybe that can help you!
Uy79dKEmaa	It's good that you give all your cats equal attention.  I know that is hard to do when one cat is needier than the others.  Try giving him some special one on one time (the other cats will understand).  Perhaps in another room away from the other cats so he will know that he's getting your undivided attention.  It could be that he might enjoy play sessions more than petting sessions.  Again in a separate room, try some interactive games with him (a wand toy like "da bird" is great for this).<br>  <br>  Continue your regular routine with the other cats and everyone should be happy.  Hope this helps!
fjuQYf9caa	I have 3 albino rats and they do 'head sway' but this is completely normal. While albino rats do suffer from particularly bad eye sight they are not always completely blind and can usually make out blurred shapes.

K0tpQoHRaa	well the first thing that you will need to do is to buy a breeding box from a local pet store.ask in specific for budgie breeding box size.if the hen (female) is her poo would increase dramatically in size, she would become more aggressive,and posibly bite when hands enter cage.she will be territorial and be protective of her nesting erea or breeding box.after mating she will lay her first egg within a few weeks,and lay more every other day.the hatching procces takes 18 to 21 days and one will hatch every other day in order of being layed the mother will feed them for the first couple of weeks then the father (mate) will pitch in and help as well.you will need to keep a close eye to insure that ALL hatchlings are being fed,as you will have to feed ones not being fed as much as others.well that sums it all up hope every thing goes as plans good luck.<br>  <br>  You can also tell if she is preg if the couple are cought succesfully mating, this is when the female lifts her rear feathers as the male gets on top and puts his under her.....<br>  <br>  good luck!!!!|`|lMSAyTm6aa	parakeets are social birds.

(if there is a long run... most baby turtles that are purchased from pet stores don't make it past their first year when purchased on a whim like this).<br>  <br>  Go to where you plan on purchasing the turtle from, look around, ask what KIND of turtles they are, ask if they've got a care sheet (or better yet, a book on the care and maintenance of whatever species you're considering) and spend some time doing a bit of research beforehand so you can head off problems that will bring you back here asking "I just got a turtle, what do I feed it?" "I got a turtle, should it's shell be soft?" "Why won't my turtle open it's eyes?" (all very bad questions for people to have to ask, but they're asked here every single stinking day and it drives us nuts.)<br>  <br>  And remember, after you've gotten what the turtle NEEDS, you'll probably have spent close to $200... and that's before you've even gotten the turtle.<br>  <br>  Think ahead.

H85jEESCaa	It depends on the breed.  Some breeds usually have more and some less.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Somewhere between 1 and 15.  Have her SPAYED!!!!!|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	What breed is your dog ? How old is she? You have a dog who will have puppies, but you don't talk about anything else. Should she have been bred ? You should have researched the breed and know what is an average sized litter for that particular breed. Your dog could have anywhere from 1 puppy to 16 puppies. Does that help?|`|aCqSF87Raa	Depends on how fertile both she and the male dog are. I'm surprised you weren't required to spay her - most shelters or adoption places require it so that THIS doesn't happen...<br>  <br>  Take her to a vet for an x-ray. That's the only sure way to determine how many pups she's going to have. It's better to have a clear cut number so you can more easily tell when she's done or if she's having complications.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Why isn't your adopted pet spayed? The world is overrun with homeless dogs, why are you creating more?<br>  <br>  The only dogs who should be bred are the ones who have titles and all their genetic health testing done to ensure the puppies don't end up with crippling genetic disease. <br>  <br>  Hopefully your dog will be having zero puppies because that is the exact number of pet dogs this world needs more of.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Although I don't believe in scanning/x-raying unless absolutely necessary (all will be revealed in the fullness of time - scanning involves a vet trip, and sick dogs go to vets so apart from the potential for stress in going there, why risk her picking something up etc.etc.), if you don't know who the sire of these puppies was, you do need to have the pregnancy confirmed and find out the potential size of the puppies at this stage.  If they appear very big now, she could well need to have an elected C. Section to get them out, or risk losing her life in the attempt.  <br>  <br>  As for how many - each pregnancy is individual so even if you knew how many she had before, this has no bearing on how many she'll have this time.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	The only way of knowing is to take her to the vet and have an x-ray or ultrasound done.  She could have anywhere from 1 puppy to 13 puppies, depending on the size of your girl and what she was mated with.  Also, SHAME on the shelter for not insisting you spay your dog.    And, shame on you for letting her have another litter of puppies.  Good luck finding good homes in these troubled times.  So many people are surrendering their pets because they can not afford them right now.    You should not have let her get pregnant.|`|yotafojtaa	If she's pregnant, take her to the vet. Scans will need to be done on her to check that everything is OK. The vet will also be able to give you an approximate number of puppies, with an ultrasound. But please do take her to the vet, it's just as important as humans having ultrasounds.<br>  <br>  The maximum number of puppies a dog has been known to have is about 20, and the minimum is 1.|`|9a7178737d913282593305c060610232aa	We can't answer your question precisely for a number of reasons.<br>  <br>  1.) You didn't give us the dog's breed.<br>  <br>  2.) You didn't tell us if she's mixed or bred with a mixed breed dog.<br>  <br>  3.) You didn't give us her age.<br>  <br>            Sweety,we can't answer your question without an ultra-sound. We haven't even seen this dog.Take her to a vet for an ultra-sound when she's about a month pregnant or when her nipples start to fill out with milk and she gets rounder. They can get your dog an ultra-sound and see how many puppies she'll have and you'll get to see them on a screen,just like a human baby.We can't tell just over the Internet and the vet will give you more advice than we can.|`|EeTJ1CEHaa	Depends on the breed. You can't know for sure unless you have xrays when she is pregnant. For example, a chihuahua doesn't usually have large litters. They usually run anywhere from 1 to 4. I know someone whose chi's have had up to 6, but her chihuahuas are the larger ones. <br>  On the other hand some of the larger breeds can have as many as 11 and so on. What kind of dog do you have?<br>  <br>  And to the readers that seem to believe their rude comments help anyone or anything, "get a life".

How cuteee ... *squeals delighfully*<br>  <br>  Well we have a german shepherd and by 12 weeks his markings were alot lighter than yours, Echo (our GSD) is currently 2 & his markings are still changing.

Promise me one thing though... Love him however he turns out. xD<br>  <br>  Fellow GSD owner =0)<br>  <br>  Abby x|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Dogs colors change up to 18-months-old.  It would be hard to guess how much the color will change in that time.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	German shepherd markings can change a LOT between puppyhood and adulthood.  Only time will tell how much he will change.  However, judging by those pictures it seems unlikely that he will have a "saddle" pattern.  He's much more likely to have a "blanket" pattern even as an adult.  You might be able to get some idea of what he will look like as an adult by looking at the parents and any adult puppies from previous litters of both dogs.  BTW, there's nothing more "traditional" bout the saddle pattern compared to a blanket pattern, sable, bi-colored, or even solid GSD.

aeonmRR2aa	By sucker fish, I assume you mean a pleco, oto, or CAE:<br>  <a href="http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/profiles/profile34.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/profi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/profiles/profile76.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/profi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/profiles/profile47.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/profi...</a><br>  <br>  But, it doesn't really matter which one, since none of them need carbon (charcoal).  There are a few fish out there that require extremely clean water (like Discus Cichlids), and if you breed such fish, carbon may be useful; but no fish strictly needs constant fresh carbon in the tank.<br>  <br>  The point of carbon is to remove trace contaminants from water.  If your tapwater has high levels of pesticides, drugs, sewage effluent, etc. then you may want to clean it with a charcoal filter before adding it to the tank (your city's web page may post the annual water quality report).  After you medicate fish, once the treatment has run its course, you can use fresh carbon to remove the residual medicine, then throw it away.<br>  <br>  All fish need constantly filtered water, with filter floss or sponge or similar material.  But carbon is really best to use only to pre-filter tap water, or in the tank filter occasionally to remove some specific contaminant.  Whenever you use carbon be sure to rinse it well first until the rinse water is no longer black.<br>  <br>  Incidentally - carbon loses most of its potency within about 3 days in a tank (partly because it quickly gets coated and clogged with a bacterial biofilm).  So plan accordingly.|`|573Q4zCpaa	yes and dont by one at a grocery store even tho  they r cheeper they have cemicals that could harm or even kill ur fish so go to a regular pet store and get 1|`|BM8bUXJUaa	i have not personnally had a sucker fish. Are you interested in a pleco or corycat? or maybe another type? <br>  <br>  as far as a know sucker fish do not depend on a charcol filter. However unless you have aquactic plants it is a good idea to have a charcol filter anyway. Charcol helps remove toxins and chemical from the water, so fish should benifit from it. <br>  <br>  If you have aquactic plants it is best not to use a charcol filter because the plants use some chemical to grow. If these chemicals are depleted then they can't grow. <br>  <br>  if you have aquactic plants then there are other products that will be benifical to the plants and still remove some toxins. <br>  <br>  Basically i don not know of any fish that absolutly NEEDs charcol. but i still HIGHLY recommend it because it takes toxins of the water.<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!
CkecSp4Uaa	Yes, it is true and yes, I am 100% sure.  Testicles that do not descend from the abdomen have a MUCH much higher chance of developing cancerous cells than testicles which have descended properly into the scrotum.  How long it takes depends on the individual animal, but generally we're talking about a few years here.  Get your dog neutered.  It will completely 100% eliminate the chance of him developing cancer from an undescended testicle and this is a trait that is passed on genetically so he should never ever be bred anyway.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Yes this is true. It can happen quickly, it can take many years.. It's a foreign body within the body. It is not supposed to be there. He should be neutered and that testicle removed.|`|hRikwc00aa	Yes, if the testicle is left inside the abdomen, it can increase the risk of testicular cancer. The safest thing to do would be to get the dog neutered - it will be more expensive than a regular neuter, but the dog will be healthier and happier in the long run.
K2nDPPpfaa	oh i had the same problem. here's what you do... nothing. my hamster took a couple of days before she ran on her wheel. the hamster is still exploring its new environment so it could take a little while. if you are truly nervous about your hamster's excersise, then put him/her in their ball to run in. they will find the wheel on their own. trust me.|`|8B7y9AEHaa	well my hamster doesn't run the wheel because when he runs sometimes he urinates on it. so maybe you need to wash it, or check his nails. there are many reasons why go to a local vet or a pet smart for more answers|`|XZlFLecLaa	hes a lazy lil hampster! <br>  <br>  try picking him up and putting him on the wheel... and make it turn... maybe he doesnt know what it is yet...|`|6BCKYKKGaa	Some hamsters just don't like running in wheels.

i5zBmtqRaa	Scruff it, like a mother cat carries her kittens.  It causes endorphins to be released and the ferret to yawn and look sleepy.  You should be able yo bathe it easily.
Uy79dKEmaa	It may take a little time and patience, but it is possible.  Try using a spray bottle to give your cat a little squirt whenever it starts playing with the flowers.  There are also cat repellent sprays that you can try.
D1beU6MPaa	At four weeks, these puppies now have teeth and they are hurting Mom. They are weaning age now. Get a good quality puppy food and add water to it. Let it sit long enough so that it is soft. Put it in a round flat bowl and let them gather around it. Wal Mart has these flat feeding bowls and they are cheap. Now, you are on your way. Good luck!<br>  Source(s):<br>  Lifelong dog owner and breeder<br>  Horse owner and breeder|`|bIaywrBCaa	I would get some puppy formula from the vet and feed that about 4 times a day. Also start them on puppy food, dry but moistened with warm water, mush it up real good. I would continue feeding them the formula for another week or so.

My pups nurse on their mama until 7-8 weeks, sometimes longer.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Get some high quality kibble, soak it in water, stir it up into a mush,<br>  add more moisture so it's soupy, and give that to them. You can replace the water with Goat's milk to encourage them to eat.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Good grief!  By this age you should have started the weaning process.  Go get some puppy kibble, soak it (water, or maybe even goats milk, warmed - not hot!) and put it down.  Make sure all the puppies are able to get to it - actually when I start weaning, I hold each individual puppy in my lap, and have just a little wamed goats milk (the liquid part) or a very small amount of raw hamburger (the solid part).  This I do at 3 weeks.  You do have to be sure not to overdo the raw meat because it's tempting as they absolute go nuts for it.<br>  <br>  Poor mum - their baby teeth are through now, and she will have been hurting!

If not and he says to give them some puppy formula, they sell it cheaper at walmart.  Not to sure on the quality tho.

D1beU6MPaa	Hi,<br>  I would think that most vet's would give you all alternatives available and amputation as a last resort. Now, if after the veterinarian has assessed the problem, he may think that amputation is the only option for this dog. But I don't think you can just walk into the vet's office and tell him you want the dog's leg amputated. He would be the one to make that decision, and give you his expert opinion as to why it is the way to go. Good luck to you.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I would suggest you have your sister talk to the vet. The decision would be hers and the vets. With proper aftercare the surgery can and is successful.<br>  The vet would amputate as a last option only.|`|iMprUF5Vaa	Last time I checked, all you had to do was go in to the Vet, and explain what's happening, and tell them what you'd like done.

Without being a vet and knowing all the details of your dog's condition, no one here can advise you well.|`|mVJdfjrmaa	That is a question that only a vet can answer - and it would be a last resort. What do you mean by a torn ACL - is that a torn cruciate ligament in the knee? My bulldog has surgery for a torn cruciate ligament and recovered perfectly, with the right after-care. We were not allowed to walk her except on a lead for a full six months. After that, it was "proceed with caution". No jumping, no running, no walking on beaches with spongy sand (which is how she tore the ligament in the first place) - hard sand only - and no uphill for another six months after the op. <br>  During the first few post-operative days, we had to  carry her out of doors to do her business several times a day, and thereafter, put rugs or sponge mats down on all our slippery floors to prevent slipping and re-injury. It was all worth the effort. Good luck.

NAGiNKFWaa	Teach him something different.  So when he starts to bite, teach him to sit instead.  Take his mind off of a bad behavior and train a behavior like sitting or shaking paws or something you do want him to do.  Praise him when he does a behavior you want.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	You can't really train a Golden puppy to calm down. If you can, email me and let me know the secret!<br>  <br>  At this age the dog really shouldn't be mouthing. When he puts his teeth on you, you have to correct the behavior. Usually making a loud shriek like "OUCH" surprises the puppy enough to release his grip. When he lets go, give him a praise or a treat. You have to be consistent and he will learn quickly that he is not allowed to mouth.|`|RPZyku2Jaa	It's time for you and your dog to enrol in some obedience classes - it will help socialize your dog and teach you how to train your dog.  In the meantime, when your pup bites, make a loud yelping noise (as his litter mates would do if he bit them) and immediately stop all play.  This will soon teach him that biting = no play.  Remember, he's still a puppy.  He needs you to set the rules and boundaries for what is acceptable behaviour and what is not.  Rambunctious behaviour is what puppies are best at:)  You must set the limits for him, and puppy classes will help show you how to do this.|`|uGWkhlb5aa	He's probably teething.so when he starts to bite you shove a toy in he's mouth.But don't yell at him.

Also, you could buy Bitter Apple Spray, and just spray it wherever he bites. He'll stop biting then, because all he gets is a sour taste in his mouth. He'll calm down as he matures and gets older, butif you want him calmer now, just don't give him attention for running around and jumping wildly. Speak softly and calmly, and don't pet him until he sits still. When he does so, pet him wherever his favorite spot is. then he's being rewarded for calm behavior.|`|uIWYc4R1aa	Take him to a puppy training class. Check out your local PetsMart or PetCo, they usually have that kind of thing set up. I'd recommend clicker training and lots of socialization. Do your research, you can even get the books at the library if you don't want to spend anything.|`|eCNrkHqiaa	buy him a toy to play tug with then he will be biting the toy not you
Rw7gi86Naa	Absolutely, rat poison can harm other animals and humans! I have seen several episodes of Forensic Files about people who were murdered with rat poison. <br>  <br>  <br>  Read these articles: <br>  <a href="http://www.nystla.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=article&articleID=1150" rel="nofollow">http://www.nystla.org/index.cfm?fuseacti...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dogworks.org/poison.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogworks.org/poison.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.earth-kind.com/Default.aspx?TabId=400" rel="nofollow">http://www.earth-kind.com/Default.aspx?T...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  It's best to use other kinds of traps. Rat poison does not work immediatly. So, if you have a poisoned rodent running around, it just may die in your wall, and that will not smell pleasant. You must remove the dead rodent and if you don't know where it is, then you have a problem.|`|bxlYleZkaa	NO! Poisons and Rat Poisons in particular, are not species selective. They will kill any mammal, including you!|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Rat poison is really misnamed - it's really a poison that will kill any mammal that ingests it, including humans.  A cat or dog that eats a poisoned rat will die of poisoning as well.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	Nope, and rat poison doesn't work anymore. BBC reported that rats have now become immune to such poisons over the years through the misuse of the poison. Rats that had only ingested a small amount (not enough to kill them) would then give birth to babies that were born immune. So rat poison or trying to poison rats doesn't actually work anymore. Plus there will be far too many for you to kill this way, rats live in large groups. You may think there's only one or two but trust me there will be hundreds of them within a few feet. No poison is animal specific, a bird that decided a dead rat is lunch will then die of poison, something else will eat the dead bird and the chain continues. You will need to hire a Professional to get rid of the few that are bothering you but you'll never get rid of them all.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	No.  Poison is meant to kill and is not species selective in the same animal category (ie, mammal, reptile, etc.). Don't let anyone (including the exterminator who wants to make a buck) tell you any different.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	No.|`|1OcnwywZaa	there are great breeds of cats and dogs that chase and kill rats ;)  <br>  <br>  i was just looking on a site, and someone said the following: <br>  <br>  "rats are super ummm..human?? i got rid of my rat problem by putting out sticky traps for the existing rodents and kept the rest away by spreading sulphur around the house and property line....wont hurt your animals and it also keeps other unwanted guests away such as snakes n spiders and other annoying rodents."|`|g4EZib5Vaa	DO NOT TRY TO KILL RATS! They have been living there longer than you have and they do not know they are doing anything wrong! And no, there is not a rat poison that will not harm your other pets. Poison is meant to kill and not just to kill rats, it is toxic and dangerous and cruel! If you have a rat problem please use humane traps and relocate them. They do not deserve to die. All they know is that they are in their home. They have no idea if they are doing anything bad. So please do not hurt them. They have an equal right to live.
8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Well my personality is golden retriever which is what I own and normally what I look like one a bit too (sorta blonde).  Happy go lucky and active.<br>  <br>  But I'm in chemo right now so I guess I'm a Chinese Crested or Mexican Hairless right now?

I probably look most like a black Labrador.  I have dark hair and I'm kind of tubby, love to eat & prone to weight gain LMAO....<br>  <br>  Personality?  I'm a Basenji :).  Quiet, but definitely able to voice my opinion when necessary.  My idea of a good time either involves being outdoors or being at home curled up in a ball under the covers with a good book.  I am prone to fits of extreme silliness, but only among close friends- when around strangers I tend to be more reserved.  I don't make friends very easily....it takes time for me to feel comfortable with someone enough to consider them a friend.  Independent, yet undyingly loyal to the few people who have earned my respect.  I question authority, I tend to do what feels right to me without worrying about what others think....I "work for a paycheck" and I tend to fight back whenever I feel "forced" into doing something I don't want to do.  <br>  <br>  I realized these things a few years back, when I was trying to figure out just why the Basenji was a breed that had so totally stolen my heart & soul.....Jibini, my first Basenji, affected me in a way that no other dog has.  I finally realized- I love these dogs so much because I RELATE TO THEM quite a bit!!  :)|`|0SHAY9TQaa	I am going to choose out of the  3 dogs that I own! <br>  <br>  I would say I look most like a....hmmm.....I am going to say Browser.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Your vet is too old school.  8 month old kittens usually have already had a couple of heat cycles. Some kittens go into heat as young as 4 months. Old school vets like to do it at 6 months but newer up to date vets know it's perfectly safe to spay a healthy kitten when they weigh 2 pounds (about 8 weeks old).  Call another vet. Make sure your house is sealed tight so she can't escape to find a mate.  That will be her top priority while she's in heat and cats can get out of some unbelievably small cracks.<br>  <br>  Cats can be spayed while in heat.  It's a tad riskier but a competent vet would be able to safely do it.  BTW, the *Vet in training* is 14 (read her profile).  I really wish people wouldn't misrepresent themselves on here.<br>  <br>  LOL! No problem...happens all the time! Be sure to check any *vet* advice you get. You wouldn't believe how many 12 year old prodigies we have drop in! Tip: a *real* vet will never give a diagnosis or treatment instructions over the internet. It's impossible to give an accurate diagnosis without doing a hands on exam. Good luck with your kitty.|`|K8jU69SEaa	Yes, that kitten is definately in heat.  6 months is a little early but not that unusual.  I had my female kitten altered at around 6 mos.. She was showing the exact same behavior you have described|`|3b30836253e0d10626723c6e7fbb6890aa	She is in heat. Im surprised that the vet told you to wait until she is 8 months old to spay her. Most of the vets here want you to wait until they are 6 months old, but some will spay at the age of three months. I have owned and dealt with many cats over the years, (and still do) and in my opinion, the earlier you have them altered the better. The younger they are, the quicker and easier they heal! You need to get her fixed asap or you're going to have male cats outisde your door!|`|d6kekKgeaa	it is possible, and it dose sound like heat. i've seen severa 6 month old cats go into heat. keep a sharp eye on her so she dosn't try to sent mark, use a spray bottle if she dose as she's trying and she should get the point. if no animals are encouraging it, she shoud go outta heat in a couple days, and should make it to 8 months without another.|`|TYyZwOtlaa	Yes, it does sound like she is in heat, no biggy though, cats can get pregnant very young! I had my cats spayed when they were 6months old, one was quite tiny, but i think if your vet thinks she is too small then its best to wait, spaying is a routine operation, but its not without it's risks, as with any operation. Best to wait, try and keep her in if possible, and just be glad you have had your other cat castrated!<br>  If you know that your cat is in heat, its best not to spay her as the uterus will be enlarged and more prone to excessive bleeding.|`|mcmOslOFaa	YES!!  She is for sure in heat, watch out for her and do not let the her out!  My female went into heat at 6 months and she loved feet...roflmao.........she meowed very high pitched and it some times would keep us up all night.  But all female act differently but she really showing signs of a heat cycle.  And I agree with with pretty kitty, you need to find a different vet, my vet is all about spaying as soon as possible!  never wait until the first heat cycle, because most people never recognize it and let their cat out and they end up getting pregnant!|`|U2KdP1y7aa	The Humane Society spays and neuters cat at 12 weeks because they have specialized tools to do so; and a 6 month old kitten is nearly grown and can go in to heat. The Ideal time to spay is at 6 months at the vets office.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsvetsandyou.com/catfaq.html#995037891" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsvetsandyou.com/catfaq.htm...</a>|`|Z93I52jMaa	Hello.<br>  <br>  Yes. Don't worry. Your kitten is in heat. They do make VERY loud sounds no madder how old they are. Although they will make them more when there a little older but they can make them when there younger too. Don't worry, its perfectly normal. <br>  :)
XurYYreBaa	1.  I love male & female rats equally.<br>  <br>  2.  A mix of whole grains & vegetarian dog kibble.  They get fresh veggies or fruir a few times a week & small dog biscuits almost every day.  We used to buy Reggie Rat & pick out the dried corn, but they seem to be doing very well on their current diet.<br>  <br>  3.  This depends on the rat.  They all enjoy their boxes & hammocks but some of them really like small things that they can carry around.  Our 2 youngest girls love playing tag w/ each other. I'm a fave plaything too of course.<br>  <br>  4.  Superpet "My 1st Home" for exotics enhanced by hammocks, boxes, ledges etc.  We have these & a large birdcage for emergencies, quarantine etc.<br>  <br>  5.  Everyone has a unique personality, as you know.  Our hairless girl is sweet but feisty & has the unusual habit of stashing her treats in the food dish.  She also taught all the younger girls how to use the exercise wheel. The older dumbo girl is very curious, loves everybody & within seconds after I open 1 of their doors she's up my arm & on my shoulder.  The younger dumbo is sweet & playful.  Our youngest girl is a bit shy but very loving & curious.  She's also boy-crazy, as she's definately interested whenever she smells our boys rats on our clothing.  Both our boys are lap potatoes.  The older 1 is alpha & frequently steals treats from the younger boy, who simply comes back to me for a new treat.  We had a siamese girl who was totally sweet & loving toward me but would bite my SO every time she had a chance.<br>  <br>  6.  Not overnight, but on short errands, visiting etc.  Several of our rats enjoy going places & are quite well-behaved, so the experience is fun for all of us.<br>  <br>  7.  We haven't taught them any tricks unless you count being litter trained or learning their names.  On the other paw, several of our rats have taught us their games, including "Stash & Dash" where each rat runs up for a treat, goes off to "stash" it in a favorite spot & makes a quick "dash" back for another treat.  They do this with nesting material too.<br>  <br>  8.  None.  We've been owned by dozens through the years.<br>  <br>  9. When I was a kitten I believed all the negative propaganda about rats & was afraid of them. My loss.  Eventually I learned the truth & adopted a baby rat (I didn't realize @ the time that it's not fair to keep solitary rats).  Our multi-species home was seldom without a rat after that & once I understood that rats need companionship we began adopting more than 1 @ a time.<br>  <br>  10.  They do so many it's hard to pick 1 but this is typical of how smart these little guys are:  We adopted 2 "feeder" girls a few years back & 1 surprised us with pups 2 weeks later.  Mama rat was terrified of us til her pups were several weeks old & she saw how much fun they had playing with us & jumping on us.  Eventually she became as sweet, loving & trusting as her babies (we kept everyone).<br>  Also, I would set up a playpen for the babies & lay down to watch them.  Although they had boxes, toys, food etc. in the playpen within minutes they'd all climb over the sides & wriggle under my shirt to curl up for a nap.|`|IFGSOd16aa	1) Male, because the female are more skittish and the males are more lazy.<br>  2) Mostly their rat food and some treats! Like Cheerios<br>  3) I like the hammock but i dont have it yet :(<br>  4) Well i got the My Super Pet cage, My 1st rat. lol but they are getting bigger so i put a tube and connected it to a bird cage :P<br>  5) Rats do have personalities!! One of mine, Otis, is outgoing. will love anyone and is eager to try new things. My other one, Aaden, is a bit shyer but loves anyone and is a bit careful. But he is learning from Otis lol<br>  6) I have not yet traveled with them. I think it would be cool, but i would be nervous.<br>  7) Yes they can. Otis can beg (stand on legs) and Aaden is in trainings. lol They are both learning to come. <br>  8) Well i owned one but 2 weeks later it died :( i was very sad. lol so these are kinda my first rats<br>  9) I wanted something that wouldnt bite me. Lets just say i owned a bunny and i got a bloody eye. (it was a pretty messed up bunny from teh prievous owners) So i found out about rats and i looked into them ALOT! I wanted something that would love me :) <br>  10) When they clean there faces! Or when they grab my finger! It is SOOOO CUTE!|`|GuOJIftAaa	1.) Males. I just love how cuddly they are ^-^<br>  <br>  2.) They get their lab blocks, veggies and a little of whatever I eat.<br>  <br>  3.) Their favorite toy is me! They love to dive off my head onto a pillow, run up my back and do it all over again!<br>  <br>  4.) I have an Exotics cage from Super Pet. It can be seen at Petsmart.com<br>  <br>  5.) If my rats were humans, Patrick would be a laid back poet type, Moody would be the little drama queen that always starts drama, Darwin would be a guitar player for a metal band and Priscilla would be a snooty princess =]<br>  <br>  6.) Patrick is the only rat that goes places with me. And that's usually every day.<br>  <br>  7.) They all know their names and come when called or come when I click my tongue.<br>  <br>  8.) I own 4 now but have had 8<br>  <br>  9.) Their amazing personalities. Rats are just amazing little creatures that don't deserve the bad reputation they have.<br>  <br>  10.) My males will grab the wire door to their cage with their little hands, pull it back and let go thus making the door bang loudly all through the day until I let them out. Funniest thing ever. They look like little jail birds!|`|UlOKMInqaa	1. I've only had females so I can't say which I'd prefer. However, the next time I get rats, I am going to give males I try.<br>  <br>  2. I feed my rats lab blocks or a seed mix in the morning and then part of my dinner for an evening snack.<br>  <br>  3. My rats love this fabric cube that hangs from the top of their cage. All three of them will stuff themselves in there and cuddle up to each other. It's adorable. <br>  <br>  4. I have a two level ferret cage that is made of wire.<br>  <br>  5. One of my girls is more skiddish than the others. She doesn't like loud noises and runs into her cage to hide if she becomes scares. The other two are buddy buddy and do everything together.<br>  <br>  6. I traveled with my rats this weekend as a matter of fact. I just put their cage into my jeep with some bags on each side so that the cage wouldn't slide around. It was quite a long drive (2.5 hours) and they just layed in their little house the whole time. <br>  <br>  7. No, my rats don't do tricks. <br>  <br>  8. I've only owned the three rats (the ones that I have now).<br>  <br>  9. I heard that rats were good pets and I was very curious. I am a college student and they aren't allowed in the dorms so I didn't get any. Then the opportunity presented itself and I took my three girls in (how could I resist!).<br>  <br>  10. I'm sure this isn't unique but I love when my rats crawl up on y shoulder and lick my face. They are so sweet.|`|dlUof4cnaa	yep the rodent sections the place to be!!!<br>  1) i personally prefer male<br>  2)rat food from the pet store<br>  3)me!!! they love climbing on me!<br>  4) pets at home    <a href="http://www.petsathome.com/find/category-is-6+small+pets/breed-is-rat/product-is-22955" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsathome.com/find/category-...</a>    quite expensive but i saved up and washed a load of cars!!!!<br>  5)mine are cheeky, funny daring sweet and eager to please<br>  6)no sorry prefer to leave mine at my friends house<br>  7) how do you Define a trick? he'll follow a treat anywhere!!!<br>  8)4<br>  9)the general cuteness, plus i luved my cousins<br>  10) look at me with the most adoring eyes ever, and then jump from a floor and land with such a shocked look!!!<br>  <br>  rats rule!! sadly my rat passed away several months ago, and i haven't  got a new one yet because my baby brother may have an allergy =(<br>  <br>  gud luk wiv ur rats|`|hdQvbs0naa	1.Which do you prefer-female or male? Why?<br>  Well, I can't say I prefer them, but I've only had experiences with males. Never had gals before. <br>  <br>  2. What do you feed your rats daily?<br>  Mazuri lab block & fresh veggies. Usually whatever I'm planning to eat that day. They do LOVE bananas, too. <br>  <br>  3. What is your rats favorite toy (hammock, you, etc)?<br>  Hammocks, of course. They're lazy bums and will lay in them all day long. <br>  <br>  4. What cage do you have? A link would be great, unless homemade.<br>  I have the Ferret Nation. Modified with hardware cloth on the bottom for when my younger three were babes. <br>  <a href="http://i135.photobucket.com/albums/q142/courtbarr/001.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i135.photobucket.com/albums/q142/...</a><br>  That's a link to the photo when I first got the cage so it's pretty bare, but that's the basic idea, although that was before the modification with the hardware cloth. <br>  <br>  5. What are some of your rats personalities? And don't tell me rats don't have personalities :)<br>  Templeton is reserved, but sweet. He's my solitary boy, won't tolerate the other rats for long before starting a fight he can't finish. But he's lovely to humans and loves to sit in my lap and groom me. <br>  Reggie is my other big boy, and he's my squishy one. Very loveable, and he adores the taste of boogers and is constantly trying to lick the inside of everyone's nostrils. <br>  Westley, Fezzik & Inigo are the brothers, and they really stick together, although Westley tends to be more adventurous and climbs EVERYTHING. Fezzik is jumpy and Inigo is a sneak. They know they aren't allowed on the bed, yet Inigo is ALWAYS trying to make it up there. ;P<br>  <br>  6. Have you ever traveled with your rat? What was it like?<br>  Noo, I'm not so brave. Although I'll be moving soon.. that will be interesting. ;P<br>  <br>  7. Can your rat do tricks?<br>  No, no tricks, although they do know certain words. Such as "I've got something for you!" :)<br>  <br>  8. How many rats have you owned?<br>  5, all of the boys I currently have.<br>  <br>  9. What made you want a rat?<br>  I work in a pet store, and I started interacting with the rats there, then started reading about them online, and that was it for me. <br>  <br>  10. What is the cutest, funniest, or most unique thing your rat has ever done?<br>  Westley once climbed the door of the cage to the top, then leapt from the cage door to my bed and curled up on my lap. :]<br>  <br>  Please don't answer anything that insults owning rats. Thank you.<br>  <br>  <br>  As a little PS.

61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	Hi,have never heard of a dog by that name.Have searched but cannot find it.|`|4hM6xTptaa	are you sure it is spelt like that? or is that the way it is said?<br>  <br>  Its a possibility that this is a 'fake' breed.. or a slang for another breed.|`|qapJU3tMaa	No such thing.  Tried a search and nothing came up.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	You already asked this and there is no such thing. No breed is called that.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	You must be thinking of a Cane Corso. I generally refer to them as a Corn Queso though...
RGQJfaCKaa	They are new to the cage and still need to explore. Your hamster will see the bottle and wonder what it is. It will go to it and try nibbling it. It will realize that this is for water and it will remember that. NO the food dish should NOT be full at all times. See this is what hamsters do. They will stuff all of the food into their cheek pouches and bring it to the place where they store their food or where they sleep. They will only eat 1/4 to 1/2 of the food you give them. Put like 3 pellets in once or maybe twice daily. Check how much food the hamster has stored and then depending on how much food they have left over put in more or less food in their bowl. I had the habitrail adventure cage and the water bottle stuck in to the main part of the cage. My hamster would only drink in the morning, mid day and at night. She would also drink after exercise. The hamster will learn over time that your hands are not food. However if you have food smells or food on your hands at the time of holding your hamster then it may smell the food and nibble on your hand or fingers. Wash your hands before and after handling your pet.|`|V6Zoz4GYaa	squeeze the bottle so that there is a drip of water from it. might realize theres water in it<br>  <br>  the nibbling i because your hands smell of food, simply wash them|`|h1vYbEY2aa	my two guinea pigs had a water bottle which they never used <br>  <br>  we realised they got all the water from the salads they were eating <br>  <br>  so dont worry water out of a bottle wont be on the top of their agenda when theirs food around

LOH6UVh7aa	She will not stop because she is pregnant. That is a very undesirable behavior. I would not breed her the foal will/may learn the habit.  That is NOT a chance I am willing to take with my foals!!  That is something I would do to avoid!! Bad idea!  If I was looking to buy a horse/foal & they windsuck I would keep on walking. Windsucking is a very bad habit! That does NOT stop. They have to have a collar on them at all times. It causes many different health problems. I would skip!|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	Well, I have very successfully bred a healthy "vice" free foal from a wind sucking mare. Put her in a field with electric fencing only. Then there is nothing for her to hang on to and windsuck. There is some opinion that wind sucking may be partly caused by over acid stomach and feeding chalk can help. It certainly helped with my mare. I sold her some time ago but I know she is doing well.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	It's unlikely her pregnancy will be affected by windsucking.<br>  <br>  However, be forewarned. There seems to be a genetic factor in windsucking.  And it's not necessarily a "learned" behavoir. Studies have shown that horses who do not have a parent who windsucks will not learn to windsuck even if they live in a barn with several windsuckers.  But if a foal has a parent that is a windsucker, they are likely to become windsuckers themselves at some point in time.<br>  <br>  I had a mare who was not a windsucker, who was bred to a stallon who was.  At the time, I had thought windsucking was a "learned" behavoir, and wasn't bothered by the fact the stallion was a windsucker.<br>  <br>  The resulting foal was never exposed to windsucking, and didn't have an issue. Until she was sold as a three year old, and was at a barn for ONE night next to a windsucker.  She immediately started windsucking, and her new owner was NOT pleased. She wanted to know why I didn't tell them the mare windsucked.  I don't think she believed me when I said she never had given any indication of it in her life with me.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way I'd consider breeding to a windsucker now would be if the horse was world class.  And even then, I'd have to think hard about it.|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	I is honestly one of those debatable questions and usually your horse will have to stop cribbing during pregancy: here is a link that actually stops the horse from cribbing: its kinda expensive but it may be worth your future foals life:   <a href="http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp?pn=X1-1704&ids=320248103" rel="nofollow">http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp...</a>|`|5kUxkun3aa	years ago we had two mare's that wind-sucked. they will have had around 6 foals over time between them. as far as i am aware only one filly went on to wind suck herself. and only did it when stressed.<br>  so i guess you don't necessarily have to worry about the vice been passed on.although it could.|`|wKCgaoZVaa	They say horses windsuck because of habit, but a lot of the time its bad digestion.

eZ5rWB5Yaa	Hi LaDy DeE,<br>  <br>  I have a 14 month old female (spayed) Yorkiepoo and just took some measurements for you.  First, my girl came from a 6lb. male Yorkie and an 8lb. female Toy Poodle.  Their (my) puppy currently weighs 8 1/2 lbs.<br>  <br>  Here are some measurements:<br>  <br>  Length (Tip of nose to base of tail)= 18"<br>  Width= 5 1/2"<br>  Height (Floor to top of back)=11"<br>  Height (Floor to top of head)=13"<br>  Height (Floor to tip of nose)=12"<br>  Height (Floor to tummy)=7"<br>  <br>  Regardless whether your puppy actually reaches 10lbs. or not, we are still talking about a very small dog.  Oh, and don't pay any attention to others on this board who will refer to your Yorkiepoo as a "mutt."  They are nasty and full of attitude.  <br>  <br>  My little doggie is a wonderful companion, with an outstanding personality and temperament. <br>  <br>  BTW: I would recommend crate training.  I used it and my pup caught on very quickly.  Just be patient and look for progress.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy your puppy and good luck!|`|uGWkhlb5aa	Its a pretty small dog.but it really depends on the type of dog.a little less than a foot a guess=)<br>  <br>  help me ?<br>   Help i like this dude but i think he hates me?|`|LGV9uiFLaa	It should be about 10 pounds.|`|h1vYbEY2aa	probably double the size of an average size female cat|`|GmVR2CxGaa	Wow a 10 pound dog you say? I think it should be around 10 pounds.|`|DU0F48B3aa	without knowing teh background it's impossible to say.<br>  some poodles and yorkies have long legs and short bodies while others are short legs and longer bodies.<br>  Some are short but stocky<br>  Have they bred these exact dogs before and do they know the full background of both parents? You need to go back at least 3 genertaitons.<br>  My sister has a "toy" poodle only 5 inches tall and 4 pounds however both parents were Minis mom was 12 ppound dad 15 pound therefore if her pup is bred he could throw large pups or small and not breeding before who knows what you may get .|`|ZGFXBie9aa	There's really no way to know, as the puppy is a mutt... even with purebred dogs it can be hard to say... but since the puppy is not purebred, you cannot even get an accurate estimation.
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Hard to say, sounds like he got to the vet quickly, so his odds of being okay are greater than if you had waited.. Depends on the other dog, and what kind of damage he was able to do.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	That's impossible for us to know.  But, MOST of the time (not all just most), when dogs fight the damage looks way worse than it actually is.  And dogs usually heal up a whole lot faster than we would.  <br>  <br>  But, you'll just have to wait until who ever took him to the vet comes home and talk to them.|`|6qsocyK3aa	It depends how bad his wounds are but if he is at the vets, he is in good hands. Did you get the details of the dog's owner? They should be paying for this!|`|AA10200409	A dog heals quickly. If your dog didn't get a bad infection or injury or lose a lot of blood, then he should be okay. I'll offer a little prayer for him. I have Beagles too;)|`|p7swtBYzaa	Call the vet's office or your friend and stay in touch with the situation, no way anyone on here can predict.|`|xJqg0DFSaa	Don't worry the wounds can only get better your dog should be fine. I have never heard of a dog dieing from a bite .|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Nobody can see your dog over the internet.  Get your dog to the vet if you're worried!  He was bitten, he needs help from the vet ASAP.
uCQgf28Xaa	I think Buddy is a just a large poorly breed Pom. It is not unusual for "pet quality" poms to get up to 18 lbs. These are usually the result from a back yard breeder, or a puppy mill.  He really looks like a pom in the 3rd picture, was this after a grooming?|`|11PAFD9Caa	Papillon and Pom.<br>  <br>  He has the coloring of a Papillon and the ears and coat type of a Pom. Definitely not a full bred Pom or Papillon.<br>  The ears of Papillon stick up and out and look the Butterfly wings......<br>  Your dogs has perfect Pom ears.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|2S0BkT7oaa	Possibly a Keeshond pomeranian mix?.. But I doubt it. <br>  <br>  He really looks all Pomeranian to me.|`|6qsocyK3aa	He looks all pom to me.|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	part chiuaua, part pom. not full blooded|`|p7swtBYzaa	Either a big pom or a big long hair chihuahua.<br>  Very, very pretty little guy in any case.

3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	As in, a tank that has fish in it?<br>  Get a small gravel vacuum rated for that size tank.  Once a week(assuming the tank is cycled and not overstocked), clean the gravel and change out about 25% of the water while you're doing that.  If you have any algae you need to clean off the sides, just use a non abrasive pad or cloth to wipe it off-I'd do that before doing the water change.  Once a month, take your filter pad out and rinse it in the bucket of used tank water you just gathered from the cleaning.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about cleaning a tank you just bought, warm water and a soft cloth, or add a bit of vinegar to it as well and clean it.  Rinse well.  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Scrub the algae off of the walls, wait 10-15 minutes and let the filters suck it up.<br>  <br>  Clean the gravel with a gravel siphon, only change about 1 gallon, then replace the water, be sure to add dechlorinator.<br>  <br>  Add medications AFTER you do the tank maintence.<br>  <br>  And you are done!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|2wLF7AJTaa	Pretty much the same way you would clean a 10 or twenty, use warm water and one of those fantastic little algae scrubber pads. I also recommend gravel vacs, they clean the debris up from the gravel fairly well, but you are working with a siphon so its best to do it when your planning a water change.<br>  <br>  <br>    If your disinfecting a tank the scenario is a little different, 1 part bleach to twenty parts water, soak for an hour, rinse thoroughly, and let sit in the sun for a day or two to destroy any remaining bleach. don't do it with the fish in the tank either. Bleach will kill fish.|`|e55cjnbJaa	If it's too heavy, you will have to buy a siphon. First, put all of the fish in a different tank. Use the siphon pour the water into a bucket or the sink and suck up about 25% of the water. Make sure you put water conditioning in when you return the fish to their home but first fill up the tank again. I hope this helps.|`|zomEQtVtaa	Like the first guy said use warm water. But if you want an easier clean buy a filter 4 your 5 gallon fish tank(But u still have to clean the filter!)|`|CiHh3Qvfaa	warm water<br>  if u use soap they will all die
Lt9AmXVeaa	Take the dog to the vet and he/she will advise you on medicating your dog. You can't get a safe diagnosis like this over the internet.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	cold bath?|`|6qsocyK3aa	There are no home remedies that will be both effective and safe. You will either not just help him, or worse, do him harm. You need to see your vet for proper treatment.

You could try giving your puppy a cool bath but the water must not be cold.<br>  <br>  If your puppy is showing any of the signs of above and the conditions don't seem to be changing for the better then you must consult a vetirinarian..<br>  <br>  Fever can be symptomatic or serious conditions such as parvovirus or distemper and these conditions need immediate treatment if your puppy is to have a chance of recovery|`|XnqS5uu6aa	puppys cant have fevers

But fancies like Calico Fantail at PetSmart are $13 where at Country Max, Calicos are around $3.00<br>  <br>   But fish can be like $750 as David K said.<br>  <br>  PetSmart sold Tetra FOOD for $55 but I don't know how much tetras the fish are.|`|g4EZib5Vaa	Around $1.70-$6.00 for just the fish, depending on size. But the tank and filter and oxygen cost a lot more. Some fish cost more than that but they are very large. Most tetras are in between $1.60-$3.00 each I got mine for around two dollars each. Tetras are good fish and if you get silver ones they live for a really long time.|`|mEWTWGslaa	A freshwater goldfish usually costs around a dollar. A saltwater fish are way more expensive and usually costs around 15.00 dollars, but the problem is the tank and food and the pebbles and the plants usually add up to around 25.00
WqGxGJkbaa	Your cats do not recognise each other because of the change in smell.  Do some scent exchanging - take a clean cloth and wipe it around the face of the one who has been groomed (where his scent glands are) then wipe the same cloth around the face of your other cat and vice versa.  Cats recognise SCENT before SIGHT so by transferring their smells they will recognise and accept each other as familiar.  I am surprised a groomer did not recommend this when you collected your cat - not very professional!!!!|`|d6kekKgeaa	he smells wrong - like the shampoo - when it wears off, they will be fine again. nothing you can do to speed the process, it should only take a few days.
da0aae2062bfa45dd5bf319b25c3e886aa	Well, the outlook may not be so good depending on where he broke it. My duck had his toe broken last year (our dog stepped on his foot) right at one of the joints, and has never properly healed. There is a big, bumble-toe like callus on the underside of the joint where he applies pressure when standing and walking, and it can no longer bend like the other toes. I keep him on grass all day (and his pond) and he sleeps in a padded and newspapered enclosure during the evening. That way, the pressure on his joint is not irritated. If it is a clean break in between two joints that your duck has, he may be entitled to a better healing experience than mine. My duck no longer walks with a limp, but if he over exerts himself he will occasionally get a little gimpy. Hope your duck gets well soon!|`|AA11878029	it could be infected...I would take him back to the vet !!|`|pYF9KnNeaa	It depends entirely on the severity of the break and how well it heals.  Also whether it heals straight or out of proper alignment.  Your best bet is to give the vet a call and ask him/her.  That's assuming they saw your duck in person and didn't just give out pain meds.|`|MJFvBOjfaa	How did your duck break his little toe!!!???
Um8osMNuaa	lf it was alive the legs would have been moving, the Advantix would have started to kill the tick as soon as it ingested any blood. Although it is better to remove them as soon as you see them, the less time they are on the dog, the less chance of them passing on any diseases.<br>  lt's better to crush the tick to make sure it is dead, if it isn't it can reattach itself to your dog.<br>  <br>  lf the head is left behind you don't need to worry, you can apply antiseptic to the area to help clean if you wish. The area will swell and go red, but will return to normal in a couple of days.|`|yp9rEMSraa	the tick you pulled off your are going to need to burn it or put it in rubbing alcohol to kill it.....you can examine the tick to make sure you got the body which is the part that stores the blood and at the end you should see a little head with legs...if you see all of that you got the whole tick of your dog....|`|TYyZwOtlaa	You shouldn't really pull ticks off  unless you have a proper tick remover, as the head quite often stays embedded in the skin, and can cause an infection, did you make sure it was all out?
