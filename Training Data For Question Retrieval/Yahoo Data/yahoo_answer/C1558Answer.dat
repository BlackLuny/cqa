Nqd9L3fvaa	I agree. I think it's rude and disrespectful, not to mention very immature.|`|VGhy6Wdxaa	I used to say it out of habit when i was younger im not against gays or lesbians or anything i just said it!|`|2c9238ee724e9355edb9828e79f799d2aa	I have a lot of gay friends so I have nothing against gay people but I have to say that your question is really gay|`|Ckw1RCczaa	I hate that too. People don't realize how insulting it is to hear 'gay' being used as a synonym for 'stupid' or 'lame.' Maybe just point this out to them? Ask them how they'd feel if you said 'that sweater is so straight!'|`|96R2sEgfaa	To be honest. I say it too... lol. No big deal to me!|`|QsxIPCCZaa	I know what you mean|`|xg0AamKwaa	Why does it drive you insane ? It means somewhere in your mind you regret to be gay. You've a guilty conscious. Somewhere you feel what you are doing is wrong and you feel weird about being gay because you are not like others. Don't try to cure the world just help yourself|`|AA12006309	I say it, I also say things are "queer".  Granted, *I* am queer, so I think I've earned that right.    Example:  Me and my friend Matt went to the mall.  I saw the cutest rainbow studded belt, I squealed, ran up, and cuddled it telling him "OMG I love it! It's so queer!"  Because.. it is, and I am.  Ergo.|`|wr10vJgBaa	It bothers me to an extreme level!!! but then again i say that's retarded then i feel hypocritical. i am lesbian and it just bothers me or when people are talking and one says dude that's so homo. argh  it is a very angering thing|`|FEb0qWoVaa	I think you should stop being so uptight. "Gay" is also a figure of speech, and isn't intended to offend anybody. I've known many, many gay people and not even one ever got offended at calling something gay.|`|pdyhuZmeaa	I just feel, if your comfortable with your sexuality then you shouldn't be too offended by this. you should be able to laugh and giggle about stuff. I have been out for over 6 years and make fun and laugh along with my boyfriend and friends! =)|`|CcgDj9GIaa	I hate it too; it's like they're trying to imply that being gay is not right.    They can't just say "That was messed up"; they have to say "That was gay."    Seriously, very prejudice.|`|5yLqsD4faa	I hate that too!!!  even though I'm not gay it still bugs me|`|WFYtrtRmaa	not just sweaters..anything. it bothers me alot too...but only idiots and ignorant people make those kinda judgements. inanimate objects dont have a sexual orientation!!!!    so there basically using the word "gay" in a negative way =p  as an insult!|`|LgCtQgeCaa	My answer is the same.  It is Rude..  And i have experienced it, too..  Just do not care for what they said?  You are what you are.  They are who they are.  They are not you.  They are Them.|`|B94G0Y7haa	well i'm not gay and to admit it, it slips out sometimes:( but i actually have thought about that before so its funny you ask that question. i do think its disrespectful but since everyone does that i don't always catch it, when its being said or if i accidently say it. but i have thought about it before and realized how rude that was and how i would be uncomtorfable if someone said that. its weird how society always twists the meaning of words, without even knowing it sometimes!|`|pM3q540haa	It pisses me off. So I "nicely correct" them by calling them a dumb *** who  should go live in a hole and die, or if they're my friend I remind them that stupid would be a better term.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	I don't mind.|`|2uUctFHEaa	it gets to me some times but not usually. i think only the LGBT community has the right to say if something is gay lol|`|32lv9NmKaa	it bugs me too my nephew is 14 and he says that alot and just looks away when i look at him|`|upqJU9yiaa	Im not gay and it still pisses me off cause its pretty much disrespect for gays saying something is gay in a negative way.     But i guess people just get used to saying it idk its annoyinh though|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	i think its super rude  theres many more words out there  and how dies gay even fit into that category?  its stupid|`|420d72e7d945fb5cb4d470808614f009aa	I don't like it either, but it's just a way people talk nowadays.  Back in the olden days, people used to say hurtful things like "I'm sweating like a (insert the N word here) at an election," and didn't think a thing of it.  The fad for calling something people don't like "gay" will pass eventually.  They'll find someone else to insult.|`|Dkylapi6aa	YES! During break i went on vacation with my cousin and he would not stop saying stuff like that. I hate it especially when instead of gay they go all out and say stuff like "He runs like a ******." UGH PISSES ME OFF!|`|YIOIUZZlaa	i know what that is like ny friends say that is so gay and i am like shut up and then they way are you gay and i wanna say yesss god shut up|`|XZlFLecLaa	i always use the term 'that is gay' when something is stupid... cuz gay is stupid in my opinion ... u think what you want...|`|PLZrvfFEaa	It used to bother me but not anymore...|`|z6YwEjlpaa	Well, i'm not gay but yes, I know what you mean. People use that phrase so much I think they have even forgotten how offensive it can be even if they aren't trying to offend somone. It has just become a way of saying "oh this sucks, or I don't like it". My friends niece is 6 years old and I caught on to something she said: "Oh man that's gay!" when she was refering to something bad her sister did to her. I told her you can't say that! Do you know what that means!? She was like, "Yeah! It means it that something sucks or that it is bad"  See what I mean?|`|vs5YwpzWaa	I ticks me off.  I personal don't think being gay is anything bad so to have someone say hurts. It's like they're holding gay people at a lower level then everyone else.|`|AA11321246	Totally agree with you.   That's why I'm doing a research on how to make the world a better place; no teasing, no sadness... just fun and happiness!!|`|mu1zdOpeaa	nope  i say it all the time  everyone says it.. you prob said it too before you were gay....  your just sensative
Ku7S64w7aa	You look ambiguous. Like you could be anything from an ethnic looking white dude, to latino, to half white half black, to half black half latino or half latino half white, or one quarter asian and something else lol. You're just ambiguous.    EDIT:  Hey I was close!!! I said "ETHNIC looking WHITE dude" lol|`|TMi1GhSHaa	you look latino or half black.. your lips and nose are dead give aways that your not totally white.. I have two biracial half black sisters and they have white skin and a mix of black and white features like you do..|`|UspK4SQBaa	White Boy.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	you look mixed w/ White and Spanish.

You may be Arabic, Lebanese, Italian, or even Caucasian for all I know.|`|uLdmXx3faa	Puerto Rican or Cuban.  Latino.  and cuz you look like my ex lol    edit:  Wow, was I off.  but yeah I can totally see that now lol|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	idk but your HOT! :) lol|`|CcgDj9GIaa	Italian    or Greek    South African|`|xEmIhOc3aa	hard 2 tell but if i were u i wouldnt put my pioc on the net for  's of reasons...pervs.. and pedo's ..but u are very good looking gentle men....|`|ZkuYBUByaa	You look SEXY as hell.

i8U4hcOBaa	The language is called mathematics :P. These letters are perso-arabian symbols of 1, 8, 7, 9 and 7 respectively, but what the heck they are doing there, I have no idea.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Try taking a picture in focus and we'll have a look|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	Those are numbers, not words or letters in Persian/Iranian or Arabic.|`|utMcsTlUaa	It is really difficult to tell. Are those standard letters, or other foreign symbols?    And still, it could also just be the name or brand of the manufacturer of that sword. Or it could not be a language, but a made-up word.

So i hope not.|`|7kR5dBTlaa	she's a drunk too. loves her whiskey.|`|3oCdTWYZaa	I like Losasha :)    If there were no people like her anymore, then us Atheists would have declared victory long ago...her words give us the energy and resolve to continue fighting for a free and godless world!|`|176PIYNVaa	I disagree with most of Losasha's points.

I know that is what I would feel like saying if my ex, who I still love wanted back into my life.|`|j1YByf4waa	try some songs by TaTu they are kinda lesbianish, but really good.|`|37Tl4cvXaa	tATu has some amazing songs. my favorites are:  not gonna get us   all the things she said    :]
3K1QW7Oeaa	I know seriously. I thank the Good Lord that my atheist friends respect me and my christian friends for what we all believe in as I respect them.    Why are there atheists in the Religion and Spirituality section? If you were a true atheist, you would leave the subject alone and never touch it for the rest of the time you decide to be an atheist.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	It's already been disproved.    http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/    and    http://www.biblicalnonsense.com/    If you read through both of these sites with a open mind, you'll find the truth.  It's kinda a lot of reading, but isn't it worth it to find the truth? And they don't point out ALL of the problems with Christianity, but they do get most of them.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	***JUST LEAVE CHRISTIANS ALONE****    Sounds like that chick/dude weeping about Britney Spears in that video.|`|de2AwHpHaa	because evangelicals try to force their beliefs on everyone.  not all christians do.  but so many judge others, when is says judge not lest ye be judged.  but you are right - your beliefs should be respected.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Good question I taught true atheist didn't care about that.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	You should just ignore them, giving them questions like these will only make it worse for you. You know that right?|`|8Iqci2tNaa	Because it demands that we be subservient.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	WHy do Christians try and prove their views? Why do some people think creationism should be presented alongside evolution as if it is a real scientific theory?    Christians say I shouldn't have the right to do what I want with my body. They would prevent people from marrying just because they disagree. Not all Christians, but some.    There are mean crazies on either side of this but do not act like atheists and non-Christians are the only people that are bashing here!|`|GeoiGjbCaa	"I mean its really making me mad"    Gee. Life's a ***** and then you die.|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	You want people to stop bashing Christians while you bash Greeks and Indians ... perhaps people don't leave you alone because you are a judgemental bigot.|`|jRcdbna5aa	Because Christians are always trying to get us to believe in their god.  It makes you mad that we want try to disprove your religion?  Well, it makes us madder when:    1) Christians insist that people who don't believe as they do will go to hell.  2) Christians insist that this country is Christian, and, as such, they have a right to impose their religious morals on the rest of us.  3) Christians try and deny scientific knowledge and force schools to teach that their god created the world 6000 years ago.  4) Christians insist that we must all pray to their god in school.    If Christians are attempting to rule this country by their bible (which, frankly, they are), then we, as non-Christians have a right to fight back.  Part of that is by showing that your religion is wrong about many of the things it teaches.      You want non-Christians to stop picking on you?  Stop trying to impose your worldviews on everyone else.|`|ucuP0boCaa	Rationalist, atheist and agnostics do not need to disprove christianity because it has not been proven. It is a assertion. Again, it is the responsibility of the person making the incredible assertion to prove that same assertion. If they do not or cannot prove the assertion it can be assumed that that entity does not exist. Why is it christians don't understand that and keep asking stupid questions about it?|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Cause you can't prove it.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	The last time we left you guys go totally unchallenged we got the Dark Ages.

And because those people don't think (or don't want) their lives can be change.      God Bless and I agree|`|r3sg5Xsdaa	Very simple, no life.  ---------  "he last time we left you guys go totally unchallenged we got the Dark Ages."    LMBAO, so Christians and catholics caused the dark ages? So they implanted the "bubonic plague virus".  Just like the whites implanted the AIDS virus on the black community.    Gee you ARE very rational. Did you know that the people who were illiterate and educated, who knew about science were in the church and believed in God?    Thanks for the entertainme....I mean thanks for the education.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Because it's a despicably oppressive religion, with no redeeming  values.    Laws are passed based on outdated superstitious Christian beliefs. As long as this continues to happen, we will continue to speak out against it.    How can you ask not to be bashed while bashing the Greek and Hindu religions? You don't mind being a hypocrite?|`|3oNcHdgCaa	The Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists don't try to control entire governments and have their religious dogmas written into public laws.  If Christians simply kept their religion to themselves, we atheists wouldn't have a problem. Of course, if Christians didn't shove their beliefs down everybody elses throats in some way or the other, they would cease to exist.|`|47l1Sumeaa	Ignorant question.|`|DvQLt59Paa	Christians prefer to reach out to atheists. Atheists prefer to kill Christians.    "Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them."   -Sam Harris|`|AA10356572	maybe because its so easy to disprove - the Bible is so full of contraditions it's embarassing - and if there is even one error it disproves the whole thing...    where have you been living if you dont hear or see people trying to disprove other religions..    you dont even know what Hindus/Indians beleive in.. the elephant god was only one of many gods..    and YOU a "Christian" still worship the Sun good - most Christmas traditions DIRECTLY relate back to worshipping the sun God..   oh yes.. wreaths... trees.. even nativity scenes PREDATE what you think Christmas is for... look up Saturnalia..|`|FIXKYCIGaa	The question should be why aren't Christians challenging themselves when it comes to their beliefs?  I would think it would make their faith stronger.|`|LsJqpTWsaa	Your looking at things the wrong way. Atheists are not out to get you. You see, in every group, there is a sub group of bigots. There are Christin bigots, atheists bigots, Muslim bigots, and yes, Indian bigots. And no, they can't let you be. Their life is very sad. Everyone has them. I have meet Jews, Christians, and Muslims that put me down for being an atheist. Your not alone...|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	"If you are sure your religion is right then all you should feel is indifference.

You should have thought out your rant better before ranting on here. seriously. can't take the heat get out of the kitchen my friend.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	You haven't been around much, have you? Most religions get raked over the coals here, not just yours.    Look, christianity in its various forms happens to be a very vocal religion in most western countries, and a good many of its followers don't seem to know when to leave other people well enough alone. Thus, it invites criticism. Scathing criticism.|`|AA10969632	You are on an open forum and don't have to choose to read anything that disproves your religion.  But I will ask you to consider why it makes you mad...is it because you don't like others expressing their views or is it because they make sense?    Btw, there are people who debate against Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, etc...it's just not a popular topic on Yahoo Answers.  Well, maybe anti-Islam stuff is, a lot of Christians see to attack Islam just as much, if not more, as (American) atheists go after Christianity.|`|t88527U1aa	Don't worry about what they do! say what God has you to say! Most here are 15-27 with no class!

But seriously, I can't stomach it when a person who sits square in a majority complains about being bashed by a minority. It's pathetic.|`|eO9QCbdWaa	I want you to know that I believe in the Christian faith. But i do not believe in the Christian religion.    I'll explain why. The first dude spoke of it.  So many churches, Christians, and people in general take what the Bible says and use it to hurt other people because in our very essence us humans just want to feel better about me, myself, and I. So we hurt others. The Christian religion takes the differences of other people (it's especially on the lookout for what the Bible says is wrong such as homosexuality, witchcraft, sex out of marriage, etc.) and uses it to tell them they are wicked and horrible.    THIS IS NOT WHAT GOD WANTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    God said to love one another. Not hate. Yes we are supposed to spread the word of God but God doesn't want us to hate people! He wants us to love others and recieve their love humbly. God loves everyone despite what they do. If He was to discriminate against sinful people by keeping them away from His love and then through the salvation of Jesus then He would have nothing to do with any of us because we all sin. He doesn't have a gadget that measures how sinful each sin is. To Him a lie is just as bad as the actions of a person who is gay and so on. So my point is God loves everyone and if He loves everyone then how dare we of the Christian faith deny people our love? God commands it of us. And yet we do not do what He commands. And the outcome is the hatred of the Christian religion. You reap what you sow.    I hope this helps. Oh and i don't want you to take what i said against the Christian religion as an attack on you. I just strongly think that the Christian religion and the leaders of that religion need to take a second long good look at whay they SAY and then at what they DO.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Theists, especially christians, try to control and restrict us based on their views. If all christians stop crusading against science, education, culture, art, sex and sexuality, religious freedom and such, and stop telling everybody else they're going to be tortured throughout eternity unless they join you, I assure you that you won't encounter nearly as much hostility.    Christians still kill kids for "witchcraft" today.  http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/di...

oP3VVW5raa	Well  the way to a persons heart is through the stomach...    I have been told that my gift is empathy.  When working in orthopaedic nursing in my city's big hospital I could get the mental health patients and those who needed/had police guard, the bikies and the drug addicts to be compliant and happy and friendly with the staff. I am also good with the regular ones.  All it takes is active listening, watching body language, the words they don't say...    Another I sentence :  I was also good at removing dressings from major wounds without the patient noticing.  And I loved doing major dressings.  I would tell a joke or relate a story to the patient  and right when I knew it would be most painful, told the punchline or gist of the story and the patient would not have any pain nor discomfort.  You also need to soak the old dressing and remove it in the right direction and speed.  The other nurses would be dumbfounded.    I really miss nursing in the big city hospital.    My other gift is my family.  I am truly blessed.|`|207dFmdHaa	Im a great daughter, a wonderful mother, a loving wife, a good good friend, and a damn great lawyer.....this is from my husbands lips|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	Dodging bullets.|`|AA10405438	No special gift that I am aware of.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Conversation with anyone anywhere.

I think what I like that people tell me I'm great at, is many people have told me what a unique way I have at looking at things; that I instantly see things from every  possible angle. I have a way of looking at situations that no one else can ( in a good way ) . Kind of hard to explain. Almost like a "wiser than my years" thing but more -so is what someone told me once.    My mom tells me that animals and kids are my thing. That I can relate to kids so well-being patient and I see things the way the child saw it to be able to explain why they thought they did was ok but actually it was wrong and I can explain it in a way they can understand it. ( oddly, I can't have children and I was the youngest)    I personally think I'm a good cook :-)|`|2qnTP2Y6aa	Someone told me that it amazes her when i talk, because i have a talent of making people feel like crap.

It's 10% percent then you need to calculate how much you have paid to purchase products to produce the income---that is divided by 11....it's not complicated but does get involved all in good fun not that I am at all happy to pay tax but someone has to I guess.....|`|cTvP6j7Haa	My gift is my IQ and my honesty.

I made a batch just for him. I packed them in bubble wrap, so I hoping that at least some will arrive intact.    I like to read & write & I've started writing short stories again.

po4j4xhAaa	Yes, I get bothered by that idiocy; some days almost to the point of violence.  It is - to me - the same as saying "I'm not racist, I have Black friends, but...."  and then they say something derogatory about Black folks.  Ummmm, hello dummass, yes you ARE a racist idiot.    I'm trying to learn to chill.  I can NOT fix the whole world, but I can fix me and my reaction to stupidity.  And... I can choose to surround myself with intelligent and open-minded people.

I often hear homophobic language justified on the basis that "Gay people say things like that about each other all the time." Yeah, and some African-Americans use the N-word. That doesn't mean that I can walk up to a random person on the street and call them a n****r. The other thing I loathe is being paraded around as someones "gay friend" so they can impress everyone with how enlightened they are.|`|syIp6d2Naa	Well I'm going to burst your bubble, I have a friend that is transgendered, from female to male. He is a real character and keeps us rolling all the time. He is married and his wife is this little tiny spitfire who can keep his warped sense of humor under control. She had a set of twins just before they met. The kids now know the whole story as they are grown with families of their own. I knew him before he started the hormone therapy and all through the actual surgeries. There was never a question in my mind that it was the right decision, he was never a frilly little girl. If fact he was stopped for speeding (age 17) and the cop asked him why he was dressed as a girl. He was real confused when the license had a girls name and the gender listed as female. I also worked with a couple over the years and both were really nice people, one was having a little more trouble than the other but when your going through something like that you can't expect it to be a smooth road all the way.  As far as comments bothering me I have developed a tough skin and try not to let garbage like that bother me, if someone is to far out of line I will speak up. It's like some other nationalities using what I consider an insult and I'm not speaking of only the blacks. One of my neighbors has several brothers and they call each other "wet backs",  they are Americans born here so what's with the lingo. We need to start listening to what is coming out of our mouths.  Real good question.|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Hear, hear! That drives me nuts too.|`|vdRvjViLaa	yes they bother me i hate when people say ****|`|Ki90Irkcaa	nope. Im over it. You can get as upset as you would like, but people opinions are never going to change. I know people that say that, my favorite is "you're pretty for a black girl" i just think that people aren't fully aware of what they say, or they think something else and they aren't educated enough to express how they feel, so they something ignorant. I give up on people like that. Most of the time they are set in their ways, and it doesn't make or break me or my relationships. I barely notice it because i just let it roll off my shoulders.|`|AmuSvGZxaa	You're Right- I think on some level I am guilty when it comes to other issues.

aYi8oEkJaa	What's your favourite hair type?  -anything..  Short/ long  - right now i am in love with short hair .. mine is short.  curly (tight/loose)/ straight/ wavy  - natural curls, natural straight , naturally wavy is nice.  colour?  - brunette is nice   anything else?  - i love it when it is natural.. without much styling.    Do you like layers?  - yea.. love them  How often do you get a trim?  - i actually did not have exactly layers but something like that, made it quite short in sept '08 and till now i am letting it all grow .. as it looks better than the real cut now.|`|sE94HgDBaa	Super long, straight and dyed blue-black.

aIbcPSYiaa	Do you really need a point in order to love your Father?  If yes, why?    You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created. {Rev 4:11}    Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. {Matthew 5:3}    "For his invisible [qualities] are clearly seen from the worlds creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable;  because, although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened. Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things."   {Romans 1:20-23}    http://www.watchtower.org/e/na/article_0...|`|tVoMXFDRaa	what is the point in NOT pursuing God?|`|GtazNrplaa	God only knows so you tell me.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	God, who knows you perfectly and can do all things, rewards that :    Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him.

jxfZ9ebEaa	It depends on age. Let me give you the breakdown:    Age 15: 5% think you are gay. Typical quote "He's probably too into his sports and his video games to think about girls yet".    Age 18: 10% think you are gay. Typical quote "He's just starting college and he is too into his studies to concentrate on dating yet".    Age 21: 20% think you are gay. Typical quote "I know he has a lot to do but he is almost in senior year and he still hasn't found the right girl.....or any girl".    Age 25: 40% think you are gay. Typical quote "I know he is too young to settle down and he is still figuring out a career, but seriously, why isn't he dating a girl?".    Age 27: 65% think you are gay. Typical quote "His friends are all getting married or are in serious relationships, and he isn't dating anyone? Seriously, why doesn't that dude just come out of the closet already?".    Age 30: 100% think you are gay. Typical quote "Who does he think he is kidding? I mean, we're not stupid".|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Because society "norms" are that you grow up, get married and raise a family.  When you fall outside those norms, it screws with their brains because you are marching to your own drummer, instead of the beat they think you should be marching to.    As it was once asked of me, "Is there a reason why you are never seen in the company of men, only women?"  My reply was "never ask me a question you don't want to know the answer to".|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	im not sure, because?|`|p8iDpFwAaa	Because everyone figures you should have a S/O.  Or want one.      I just want "A" date or two.  (for now)|`|Ch0FmmyNaa	because society has painted a picture in these people's heads when they were young :) lol i hate stereotypers!!|`|7LJbOpK4aa	Because if you look into the past culture people have always been married  in a certain period of time. And now if you look at society everyone around  you has found the partner, or atleast think they have. Even very young kids try to find themselves wanting a boy/girlfriend. What is influencing them? Media and their peers.     Also there are still people who discriminate against gay people so they tend to hide it and refuse all marriage/relationship proposals. It takes time for one to be open bout being gay. (in my opinion, they only think their gay, for some unknown reason, even though they are not)    Anyway, since humans always want a reason for everything.....they come to the conclusion that, that particular person is gay.......(again, let me say, being gay is only a psychological thing, not biological)
Cpp1LddVaa	The most important task in any organization is the ongoing, continuous and occasionally relentless recruiting of new leaders.    In real life, people's circumstances change to a point where it's simply unrealistic to expect everyone who guided you through the past year or even the past couple of years to just be there tomorrow.    More important, new leaders and, in some instances, mandatory turnover are necessary in order to prevent "volunteer bureaucracy" in which an organization gets stale and new ideas are forbidden because an entrenched handful of people refuses to surrender control.    An essential element of replentishing leadership is to instill in the minds of members the notion that  YES THEY CAN be leaders.  This, plus a sequence of small steps that they can follow over several weeks or months, will yield a fresh crop of new leaders every year.    One more thought:  Make sure your volunteers feel RESPECTED and  VALUED.  This step is frequently overlooked by employees and other  established leaders, particularly in the years since high schools started requiring community service in order to graduate.  In many instanced, this has caused incumbents to behave arrogantly.  Remember -- volunteer is  NOT an "n-word."    Hope this helps.  Good luck and  best wishes.

ch9ipCTKaa	All true Christian Churches obey these verses. Those gatherings that do not are simply counterfeits, devoid of the Holy Spirit or devoid of love for God and if we read on the Holy Spirit inspired Word of God proves it.     This verse says clearly that a spiritual person knows these to be God's "commandments", it is the carnal person that denies it.    If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord. 1 Corinthians 14:37    The following verses show that if we love God we will obey His commandments, including those in question here.     If you love me, obey my commandments. 16And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, who will never leave you. 17He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into all truth. The world at large cannot receive him, because it isnt looking for him and doesnt recognize him. But you do, because he lives with you now and later will be in you.  John 14:15|`|E9chZY74aa	Church of Christ.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Catholic Church does, but they interpret rightly. It gives an example of a disciplinary measure that is not dogmatic.

Note those quotes are Paul's and not Jesus.|`|AA11957594	1 Corinthians 14: 34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. 1 Corinthians 14: 35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 1 Corinthians 14: 39 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.  I Corinthians Chapter 14, the Apostle Paul give the rules for speaking in tongues. Read the Chapter to get the context. The women were never allowed to speak in other tongues. If they would lean anything they should ask their husband who was allowed to hear the interpretation. Check the whole Chapter out and you find out its all about the rules for speaking in tongues. We have a church that follow those rules but we don't have to because tongues have ceased because we have the completed Word of God. 1 Corinthians 13: 8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. 1 Corinthians 13: 9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. The Word of God came in part but now it is perfect and those sign gift have ceased. 1 Corinthians 13: 10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.|`|KueK03T5aa	This must be your question of the day!  You even answered my question with this same verse earlier.    Personally...I dont attend a man made church.  Jesus is my Church. I am His follower. I have died to the flesh and live in Spirit with Christ. I no longer conform to the ways of this world. There is only one right way...and that is by obeying  the Word of God. Everything good is from God.    If you read the bible...we are saved by the Grace of God. Jesus died in our place so that we could live an eternal life with Him in Heaven. The Letter no longer applies to us....only believing that we are saved by Grace because it was the Crucifixion of Christ on the cross that gave that saving Grace to us.     Dont waste your time judging others on what they eat, if they have a head covering, or if they talk in church or not. These things do nothing but divide and create problems. God said to love one another....love your neighbor as your self....treat others the way you want to be treated.  It's all about love my friend!    God Bless you...........    Peace and love to all....."D"
bE1AuHORaa	Of course it's not, it's about Brian not Jesus. It's a wonderful film and I feel sad that all these years on people still don't "think for themselves."|`|mLYFbStGaa	I am a Christian, and I don't think it is blasphemy.  But, then again, it's been a really long time since I've watched it.  Crucifixion is not always referring to Christ, Rome crucified many people.    The only thing I really remember is "Crucifixion?  First cross on the left...."|`|f8CN2qIvaa	As an atheist, I've seen the film several times, and I've enjoyed it for the fact that I'm a Monty Python fan.

Oh, wait, As a member of the Judean People's Front, I am offended.          Seriously, though, it is not possible for a non-believer to commit blasphemy. By definition, blasphemy can only be committed by one who believes in the deity being blasphemed.      EDIT: pssst, 'tr' wrong movie. That was 'History of The World."|`|KbhADKrraa	My dad was a minister and was one of the many 'sheep' (Bah....bah) that went along with the blasphemy code without even seeing the film. Me!!

No!  Blonde Hair Blue Eye White girl > An average latina by a mile    Anyways, Mexicans girls are pretty and best of all unlike most latinas they don't have the quick tempers of Puerto Riacns.    Though in my opinion it goes    Asian Girls > Mixed Girls > White girls = Black Girls > Latinas    sorry to say this but Latinas are too overrated.    Asian girls > All    Mexican Girls = hot, well most of them, an average looking one is pretty.
eO9QCbdWaa	no. we can be as good as we possibly can but we are still bad at the heart. if we were not taught to be good we wouldn't be. think of a little child. they have to be taught to be nice and kind to others. so we are in essence not good. God is good. How can we go into something that is all the way true good when we are not? there is not going to be one person who can perform a good act and not feel smug about it or pat themselves on the back at least once in their lifetime.  and also when you think about it, would it be worth the risk to have a perfect God weigh ALL your bad acts against all the real and true good acts? does that even make sense? not to me. im way too self-addicted. anyway.    this is what the Bible says and what I believe.    You have to confess that you are a sinner. you sin. you do bad things. we all do. at least i know I do. then you must believe that Jesus took on your sin as the embodiment of God on earth and died for them. Then you have to ask God's forgiveness and ask Him to come into your heart. into your soul. into your life.     I read this book called Blue Like Jazz this past week that is really really good and helped me out a whole lot on answering some of my questions. It was written by Donald Miller and it is so..........CLEAR and i love how it speaks with such LOUD truth. It doesn't apply religious crap to life but what the Bible really says. what God really says. so if your interested i'd pick up a copy.|`|TzDvl1CUaa	no being good is not going to get you into heaven, the only way to do that is through jesus christ, i don't have time to look up verses but these are there you should take time to find them just to make sure that i am not telling a untruth,  but we are born into sin, you can be the most moral person on the planet and not be saved, we are saved by grace, not by works,|`|8e98f3909b966e0abd3d8882f55ce92caa	I believe so.

Evolution as a Religion (Routledge Classics)    by Mary Midgley    Midgley begins by noting that "I had been struck for some time by certain remarkable prophetic and metaphysical passages that appeared suddenly in science books about evolution, often in their last chapters. Though these passages were detached from the official reasoning of the books, they seemed still to be presented as science."|`|RC5RAzykaa	As a Christian, and a creationist, I will completely agree with your statement.

If the purpose of the clothing is to avoid being naked, to keep warm, and to protect oneself from harm, then it doesn't really matter that much, even if it's Yves-Saint Laurent.|`|AA10093245	It's only a "costume" to those who follow fashion trends.  Plain clothes, modest clothes, show respect for one's religion, and does not give the wrong impression. I would much rather see someone in plain modest clothing than the too-sexy weird flashy clothing that's accepted in typical western dress.  Quaker clothing is fine, and I wish more people dressed that way. I also prefer muslim clothing over hollywood clothing.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	That is a very interesting question. It is similar to the scientific observation that the very fact of observation can make it invalid.  So it might be with "plain dress" that in itself distinguishes one from everyone else.    Certainly, the plainest dress in today's society would be that which draw no attention at all. Shop at K-Mart.  The people in the picture in your link still look "different" from most people, particularly in the uniformity of their dress.    On the other hand, if part of the concept is separation from worldly things and people, then it is perfectly appropriate to wear something that makes it clear that you are not of them.    Chassidic Jews do that. The men still dress like it was 150 years ago. The women wear clothing that is modern, but more modest than most, and they cover their heads with scarves or wigs. (There is much debate among Chassidim about whether the wig is itself a vanity, which the head covering was supposed to avoid.)    Personally, I think spirituality comes from within, and you can wear a bikini on Park Avenue and be spiritual, or you can wear "plain clothes" and still be ungodly in your heart.    How you ARE is more important that what you wear.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	My personal opinion: I don't like uniformity. Christ came to set us free from all the things that bind us. God created us uniquely, and i believe  we give honour to Him by living in the freedom He gave His life for.    I believe each of us must do what we believe to be right.  I enjoy living my life in the freedom given to me and thank God for this great blessing  - and i'm blessed to be living more free as i walk with Him.    I hope i haven't offended you - it's not my intention. I think your avatar is beautiful, i have noticed it before and always think how lovely it looks - it suggests humility and gentleness of spirit - having said that,  humility is not the way we look - it's an attitude of the heart.

The word Moderation simply means, "appropriate"    They were to indulge in no excess of passion, or dress, or eating, or drinking. They were to govern their appetites, restrain their temper, and to be examples of what was proper for people in view of the expectation that the Lord would soon appear.    Simply put, when it comes to clothing (and most other aspects of a Christians life), We should not live to one Extreme or the other.  But live modestly, respectfully, and godly.|`|Z03nSGhEaa	I love the plain dress. I know most Amish make their own clothes & most of modern culture has fads... The Amish simply dress plain... I believe it is true modesty. I believe those seeking a Holy lifestyle will see it as a mark of true modesty.  Those who will not like it will be those wanting to dress to impress & also those who are envious or jealous of the purity of your dress.  It is not however your heart.  No matter how you dress there will be those who will miss-judge you & your heart.    It past decades, the plain dress was made fun of for being to plain & simple & there were shows which portrayed taking Amish folks & spicing them up with makeup & seductive clothing.  It's funny that now, as the world becomes more & more wild & crazy that you are suddenly being envied... after so many years of being pitied & ignored for your dress... & yet it has not changed.  I would say it will probably become more & more so like this, as the lasciviousness of the world becomes less & less satisfying & desirable to people.|`|0gNKRdmiaa	I think plain clothes are beautiful in their simplicity and definitely not vain.|`|RsYmnu9Baa	Plain amd modest two different words with two different meanings.  To dress plain is to is to wear a dress of  solid color (one only) ,usually dark or pastel, no jewelery, make up etc.. To dress modestly is having covered what needs to be covered and not having the female figure accentuated. The two are conducive but do not have to go together.   For me, modesty is far more important than (trying) to be plain. I do have a couple of "plain" cape dresses but mainly my dresses tend to be soft floral prints. I also wear prairie style aprons which aid in modesty. I won't get into coverings as that is a whole other subject.  So to answer your questions.  No.  Yes.   I don't give advice on how other folks should dress.  Ditto.

Now, for after we die, from a Christian perspective... it goes as follows:    Our bodies rot, get burned, whatever.    Our spirits go into a sort of "suspended animation," but not really.  You see, we, here, now, belong to a universe where TIME is an element.  Our BODIES also belong to that universe, and thusly BACK to that universe it goes.  However, our SPIRITS are not of this universe, and are not, then (when "disconnected" from our physical bodies) subject to the constraints of TIME.      Therefore, since TIME no longer exists for our souls, they sort of "leap" forward to the "point in time" when this universe ENDS and the Judgment Day arrives.    THEN, our bodies will be resurrected into PHYSICAL but ETERNAL bodies, and will be "reunited" with our spirits.  We will then face our Judgment Day, and some will go to heaven and (sadly) most will not.      Have a blessed day.|`|zE6KabiWaa	everyone has their own theories. i think this is going to turn into a huge argument page!|`|n3XRT9S5aa	we rot or get cremated|`|WlRylbs4aa	i guess we will know when it happens|`|208557bb6eec298af05daee61976e842aa	Feels like nothing.

You will only find the answer in the Bible. That is if you truley believe in God and his inspirerd word. Hear are some scriptures to look up in your own copy of the Bible.    Revelation 21:4death will be no more.                   Ecclesiastes 9:5 The living are conscious that they will die ,but as for the dead they are conscious of nothing at all     When our loved ones die, we mourn. And we may ask: What has happened to them? Are they suffering? Are they watching over us? Can we help them? Will we ever see them again? The worlds religions offer differing answers to these questions. Some teach that if you live a good life, you will go to heaven but if you live a bad life, you will burn in a place of torment. Other religions teach that at death, people pass on to the spirit realm to be with their ancestors. Still other religions teach that the dead go to an underworld to be judged and are then reincarnated, or reborn in another body.    Such religious teachings all share one basic ideathat some part of us survives the death of the physical body. According to almost every religion, past and present, we somehow live on forever with the ability to see, hear, and think. Yet, how can that be? Our senses, along with our thoughts, are all linked to the workings of our brain. At death, the brain stops working. Our memories, feelings, and senses do not continue to function independently in some mysterious way. They do not survive the destruction of our brain.    Psalm 146:4 says that when a man dies, his thoughts do perish. We are mortal and do not survive the death of our body. The life we enjoy is like the flame of a candle. When the flame is put out, it does not go anywhere. It is simply gone.    Jesus Christ spoke about the condition of the dead. He did so with regard to Lazarus, a man whom he knew well and who had died. Jesus told his disciples: Lazarus our friend has gone to rest. The disciples thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was resting in sleep, recovering from an illness. They were wrong. Jesus explained: Lazarus has died. (John 11:11-14) Notice that Jesus compared death to rest and sleep. Lazarus was neither in heaven nor in a burning hell. He was not meeting angels or ancestors. Lazarus was not being reborn as another human. He was at rest in death, as though in a deep sleep without dreams. Other scriptures also compare death to sleep. For example, when the disciple Stephen was stoned to death, the Bible says that he fell asleep. (Acts 7:60) Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote about some in his day who had fallen asleep in death.1?Corinthians 15:6.     Was it Gods original purpose for people to die? Not at all! Jehovah made man to live forever on earth. As we learned earlier in this book, God placed the first human couple in a delightful paradise. He blessed them with perfect health. Jehovah wanted only good for them. Does any loving parent want his children to suffer the pain of old age and death? Of course not! Jehovah loved his children and wanted them to enjoy endless happiness on earth. Concerning humans, the Bible says: Time indefinite [Jehovah] has put in their heart. (Ecclesiastes 3:11) God created us with the desire to live forever. And he has opened the way for that desire to be fulfilled.    WHY HUMANS DIE     Why, then, do humans die? To find the answer, we must consider what happened when there was only one man and one woman on earth. The Bible explains: Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree desirable to ones sight and good for food. (Genesis 2:9) However, there was one restriction. Jehovah told Adam: From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die. (Genesis 2:16,?17) This command was not difficult to obey. There were many other trees from which Adam and Eve could eat. But they now received a special opportunity to show their gratitude to the One who had given them everything, including perfect life. Their obedience would also show that they respected the authority of their heavenly Father and that they wanted his loving direction.     Sadly, the first human couple chose to disobey Jehovah. Speaking through a serpent, Satan asked Eve: Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden? Eve replied: Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat. But as for eating of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God has said, You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it that you do not die.Genesis 3:1-3.     You positively will not die, said Satan. God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and b|`|yZT7m5Qxaa	It depends on how you lived your life.

And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.  11  Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them.      12  And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.      13  The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them.

HUSFy3i5aa	1- The White South Africans in that country are not native Africans, they are DUTCH.    2- African American is a term used for black people of the US since they can not track their nationality down.    3-  Jamaicans are still originally from Africa.|`|AA12018110	I think the only reason is to be politically correct. Many people will argue with your first statement though, because of the slave trade ect. that Jamaicans are in fact African. Something I've wondered was, why do some Americans come to Britain and call the blacks here "African Americans"?|`|Skap7So3aa	Since all human being life (scientifically) orginated from East Africa. Most people who are "black" ancestors came from Africa. Whether their from Jamaica. If you feel this way why don't you do research.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Because for a while, that's what black people wanted to be called...or so that's what society thought. Now the politically correct thing to say is "person of color"...I've always said black. Also, their spokespeople Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson always refer to them as African-Americans, so that what other people call them too, because they are afraid of offending them if they just say black.|`|Ku7S64w7aa	well, back in the day, they were getting black slaves from Africa which the Europeans did not yet carve up into countries so they couldn't say "Nigerian-American" or "Ghanian-American" because those weren't carved up yet. So when people went from calling them the N-word to being PC, they had no idea what tribe those folks were from so they just referred to them all as "African-American".|`|xEmIhOc3aa	u sound nervous to me :) well it does matter i have no idea why they call us african 'americans' i dont see why we cant be just american ..in fact i just cant see why we all cant be just people....:( ..it seems like every1 needa a label|`|d7a112ef93eac466722c5b826bddb73caa	umm lady you just contradicting yourself.  first you ask why do people refer to 'blacks' as african-americans, but the you go on to say that not all blacks come from africa, which is true, and that not all africans have black skin. what is you question to be exact.   what are we supposed to be called, if not african-amercian or black.  i mean i agree i dont want to be called black because im not black, im a brownish color and i dont want to be called african-american b/c my ancestors didnt come from africa. but african-american is way more respectful than black and definitely way more respectful then ******. but if you really wanna call my something, call me Tiana|`|65I0e3wYaa	Because they are ignorant, but it is becoming more and more PC to say black.|`|2TETUvHDaa	technically, everyone in the world has african roots. it is thought that all life began on that continent.|`|xh5AxFDsaa	African-American, with or without a hyphen, is the most recently adopted and now the most widely acceptedin Edited English, at leastof a long succession of group names, although people of color, persons of color, and other phrases using of color as modifier are also in regular Standard use today. Most of these names began as descriptive terms but then pejorated, sometimes to the extent of being almost as offensive as the hated slang and dialectal ******. From the 1960s until the late 1980s, Black was the preferred Standard term, replacing the earlier ***** and Colored (capitalization of all three varied from time to time and with grammatical function) as acceptable both to members of the group and to those outside it. Afro-American developed during the same period. Be alert to the fact that as long as racial matters continue to be sensitive, terminology may suddenly change as events give sanction or take it away.|`|k9gp11PMaa	Ur correct, I dnt think ur racist 4 that comment, its true.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	Well, when it all comes down to it all, "Black" people decend from African and it's regions. Of course, in modern times Blacks have filled the western hemisphere and of course most of us "African-Americans" are not "black". I believe it is a term that came about during the days after slavery, were the African slaves were considered citizens. Not only that, many people back during that day were considering themselves "hyphenated Americans" (i.e. Polish-American, Irish-American, African-American) and I suppose the term African American stuck with us. But I like to consider myself as Black.|`|8RmazUuBaa	I dont know but "African-American" is a heritage for blacks of NON-Immigrant ancestry...It was invented by Jesse JAckson it means Americans of African ancestry.    Immigrants are known by thier natioanl orgin ust like whites Jamacian-American, Egyptian-American, Kenyan-American..    Barack Obama is Keyan-American, his wife would fit the definition of African American...|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	Because African American is the politically correct term for black people whose heritage is American black slavery. It has to do with our history: Jamaican immigrants are identifiably "from Jamaica." Black Americans who have been here for many generations know that their ancestors came from Africa, but they can't know which modern African nation, or even which ancient African nation, their people came from.  White South Africans are the descendants of people from England or Holland who cruelly colonized that land. The race-baiting arguments about African vs. Arab in Egypt is somebody else's fight. I wish the Yahoo trolls would make themselves aware of Morocco because the Egyptian issue has been beaten to death.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	It's just a term.... all Blacks have African ancestry.... so it's just a term. It's not the greatest term, but it's all we've got right now, haha  I'm sure someone will come up w/ something better one day, lol|`|MyV9qm99aa	You are definitely right. But I have no preference so calling me African American or black doesn't matter.    GOD BLESS|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	why do people say "Hispanic or Latino American"    but never the less the continent is still called AFRICA and they jamacians they are from a place called AFRICA too just like AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE
DzFca4Wsaa	Well atleast you acknowldege that you sound like a spoiled brat. I acutally don't think your a spoiled brat. How old are you. Make it through college, and go away for college, while spending their money. After you graduate in something that makes money, like science fields, leave. Give them some money for the time and effort and money put into raising you, and then otherwise leave. When you get angry hit a pillow, write in a journal, diary, talk to friends, talk to yourselves, walk. It'll help reduce the tensions. Best of luck !

HDbY9q4Caa	One day when I was 13 my cousin and I were walking home from a friends house.  She didn't live in a great neighborhood and I wasn't supposed to be over there at all.  I didn't want to walk home, but I knew if I called my mom to come get me, I would have been grounded for the rest of eternity.  So I braved the walk home with my cousin.  She and I were walking rather fast because there were some not very nice guys making rude comments and I didn't want anything to happen to us.  We manage to get two blocks away from her house and we sorta calm down because we knew we were about home.  The next thing we here is this ferocious barking and growling and we can't see where it is coming from.  We take off like a bat out of hell and start booking it towards home.  I made it to the house and turned around to see where my cousin was and she was gone.  Then I heard the blood curdling scream I will never forget.  I grabbed her brother's baseball bat and ran back and found one pit-bull clamped down on her arm and another one clamped onto her shin.  I took that bat and swung and knocked the one on her shin straight in the head.  It hit him so hard that his head split and starting bleeding.  He whined and then took off....but with a mouth full of her shin, skin, muscle and bone.  The other one saw its friend leave and it left too.  I beat on a neighbors door and called 911 to get her help because she was bleeding badly.  Luckily they got there in time to save her leg.  She had to take all kinds of medicine to get rid of the bacteria in her wound from that nasty dogs mouth.  It was horrible.  Her leg is sunk in where her bone should be.      Needless to say, pit-bulls scare the ever living christ out of me.  I love dogs, but not that kind.  So I guess a wild animal never attacked me, but I was just as much in danger and that could have been me!|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	A crazy fly attacked me wildly once.

Though, when I was in year 8, my best friend picked up a metal kebab stick and decided to pierce it through my hand...   While it was spraying blood everywhere, she said in the most dumbest voice "did that hurt???"  Lol, I didnt care that blood was going everywhere because I was laughing so hard lol.   I still have to scar today on my hand..    Im not saying my best friend was a wild animal lol.

My friend used to live on this huge acre of land, and there was a pretty little pond that would attract all sorts of animals. And these geese would always come there once a year. One day, her older sister told us that the geese were sad, so we should give them hugs.    And us, being the young, naive little kidlets that we were, believed her. Needless to say, the geese chased us, and one managed to bite me.    And another time, when I was in Australia, I was walking along the beach looking for seashells, and I found a jellyfish that had washed up on the shore. My sister told me to poke it, to see if it still had a little sting left in it. It did. I don't know if that counts as attacking, but I've got a little scar from it.    Other than that..I think I have a good bond with wild animals. I managed to pet a koala bear, which have a reputation for being really mean. And I pet an ostrich in a zoo once without being bitten :)

CvlBu7CXaa	I HOPE NOT!!! America is not the greatest country in the world, but it does have one thing going for it. America does prosecute rapists, and we DO NOT put the blame of those crimes on the women. The last story that I heard was that of a 9 year old girl getting stoned to death for adultery, and this isn't the only case to hit the world news. NINE YEARS OLD and ADULTERY should never be used in the same sentence ppl. ANY EDUCATED PERSON will tell you that girls DO NOT develop those urges until they are about 15 or 16. Anytime a really young girl would have sex would be because of force whether physically or emotionally. Even if a girl is a little older, she wouldn't have sex outside of marriage for the fear that a law could kill her. For every story that I have read about this subject, there was always reasonable doubt.     Something was wrong with someone's thinking when the Sharia law was written. It was either that or someone with a "God complex". Humans need to start letting God judge. This law is sooooooooo harmful and out-of-date.     I am NOT saying adultery is ok, and YES, adulterers should feel the consequences. However, they need to recognize the true adulterers.  Oh yeah!!!! What about these men that rape small children, particularly young boys trying to work in order to survive? You never hear of these men getting any kind of punishment.     Why would America allow the Sharia law?|`|I6odMsmmaa	Yeah! Why shouldn't it?    It will only benefit the country and make it a better place.

Find a dog who is not a puppy and has had some training and needs a new home instead of a shelter.  Other family members need to be considered also because the 11 year old will not be the only one caring for the new dog.  Please remember to spay or neuter the new pet!  All dogs have different personalities and the breed is only one small part of that.  Choose wisely and choose carefully .... a pet is a life long commitment.|`|AA10181795	We rescued a little Shi Tzu mother from a puppy mill. She is at the large end of the size scale (18lbs.). She has been a perfect gem and only barks at the mail person. She is even tempered and funny, She doesn't shed much, but she does need to have her hair cut every 3-4 months.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	A Westie|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	As a Certified Veterinary Technician for 13 years, I have found that the best dog is a mutt from the shelter. Purebred dogs usually come with their own sets of problems. Long haired dogs need constant grooming. Small dogs tend not to like children. And many breeds have inherited diseases that affect them. Dobermans have cardiac issues, Swiss Mountain Dogs have a particular type of cancer they can get. Mutts typically  have fewer problems than purebreds. There are exceptions, but rescuing a mutt from a shelter is much more gratifying than buying a dog from a breeder. There are thousands of dogs looking for good homes.|`|o6MQWMo5aa	Labrador from a pup, then it will look up to it's new owner.

Can be quite expensive for a pure breed (ours was 400) but well worth spending the money.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	A Border Collie comes to mind.  They love to herd and need plenty of room to run.  A Dalmation is another sweet dog that loves children.  It really depends on how much room the child has to run and romp with the dog.  We've owned purebred and mix breeds, both made excellent pets.  If you have a shelter close by, take the child to have a look.  Watch how the dog responds to the child.  It should be interested and friendly but not jumping up and barking like crazy.  The jumping and playing will come later once he has chosen his friend.  Just my opinion.|`|IbbQK960aa	Stuffed|`|7fHsyHYraa	My 11 year old grandson loves his Sheltie.

Mind you, we love all dogs, but this little guy has brought so much love and joy to our lives.|`|Q2Iq5RCYaa	Strongly suggest you do some reading on the subject. Most of the dogs mentioned here are high energy dogs, that means lots of exercise. Shi Tzu and beagles are loner dogs, that means they dont want to be cuddled to much, they like you in the room but not on them.

OUbNSXjJaa	Evil does not exist. It is the absence of righteousness or goodness, that projects evil.    Darkness does not exist. It is the absence of light. Ignorance does not exist. It is the absence of knowledge. Cold does not exist. It is absence of heat.|`|iqWfufpUaa	Evil is a necessary balance - but it is also open to interpretation as to whom and what it deems as "evil"......|`|W0Ovbpq0aa	We live in a fallen world.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	They are not necessary but they are there just the same.

All by yourself?|`|6jAVElX7aa	why not resist evil?  or even tempt your fellowmen?|`|ul1P1qAQaa	Evil is in the eye of the beholder... as long as the beholder is incapable of understanding things objectively, any misunderstanding of the other persons purpose... or any misunderstanding of how what we do effects other people....this will be a source of anger frustration and hurt... it's these things that we call evil.    Evil is relative. The more you know the less evil you actually see.  So no I disagree. Evil doesn't have to exist. I do believe that differences do though, since we cannot all be in the same place at the same time sharing the same experiences and subsequent thoughts we can't be the same. We don't have to see evil though. I actually don't see any evil anymore... only stupid. It is my foe... but it doesn't come in a form that I can hate the whole being who possesses it.|`|RJECt4zFaa	Not only is it not necessary, it doesn't even exist.|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	Good is just the absence of evil.|`|xlHC8qPqaa	GOD creates it , so it must be nacessary.|`|FJkfdzxdaa	You kinda answered your question already.|`|WmK8svvnaa	Of course.

The knowledge has been there from the very beginning about God. If what you were saying were true than 40 different charismatic people who didn't know each other wrote the 66 books of the Bible. That doesn't make sense. Trying to fathom these things with human understanding is quite arrogant. Swallow your pride and accept the fact that the truth has been revealed since the beginning to man and Satan has been trying to distort the truth by various philosophies, cults, and New Age teachings since that time.  A better analogy is that in the box is the Bible, and so many are too arrogant to open the box and see what's inside, because it will convict them of thier sin, and pride. Satan was prideful and wants to deceive you, and hide the truth too.|`|gcdMCAfqaa	Yes, I'm sure that is exactly what Palaeolithic man was thinking at the time when he decided to worship mother earth and father sky.      (....sarcasm)|`|BiXxJd2Faa	I like it as an analogy for representing what is unknown.  I think it's a mistake to think that science is made up only of knowledge and facts though.  There is also interpretation, and behind some of that interpretation lie philosophical theories of a speculative nature.  Often scientists are not aware of the philosophical assumptions they are making.      I would suggest that the sealed box, once opened, will always have another sealed box concealed within it. I also think people can have what could be described as religious experiences and thoughts without they're trying to say something about what is in the box.    Part of philosophy is showing that there is still a sealed box to those who think they have discovered all the secrets. Doing this needn't have anything to do with religion, necessarily.  Hope this is quite interesting.|`|rlthTYFmaa	No I hate analogy's why not just call them dumb?|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Funny that you are unaware that you are describing the exact opposite of an ancient story about this topic -- Pandora's Box.     "Pandora had been given a large jar and instruction by Zeus to keep it closed, but she had also been given the gift of curiosity, and ultimately opened it. When she opened it, all of the evils, ills, diseases, and burdensome labor that mankind had not known previously, escaped from the jar, but it is said, that at the very bottom of her box, there lay hope.     There is no reason to think Pandora acted out of malice in opening the jar, for she was exercising her curiosity, and also when she saw what was let out of it, she quickly closed it. "    Historicallly you are way off about science. It was Christianity that overthrew Aristotle, who said he knew what was in the box because everything operates from necessity so all that is needed is logic. For centuries and centuries people thought that a heavy object fell faster than a light one -- because Aristotle said so !!    Specifically Christianity gave birth to science   =====>The doctrine of the lawfulness of of nature    As they believed in a law abiding creator God, even before the rediscovery of Greek thought, twelfth century Christians felt they could investigate the natural world for secondary causes rather than put everything down to fate (like the ancients) or the will of Allah (like Moslems). Although we see a respect for the powers of reason by Arab scholars they did not seem to make the step of looking for universal laws of nature.    =====> The need to examine the real world rather than rely on pure reason    Christians insisted that God could have created the world any way he like and so Aristotle's insistence that the world was the way it was because it had to be was successfully challenged. This meant that his ideas started to be tested and abandoned if they did not measure up.    ====> The belief that science was a sacred duty  ... features again and again in scientific writing. The early modern scientists were inspired by their faith to make their discoveries and saw studying the creation of God as a form of worship. This led to a respect for nature and the attempt to find simple, economical solutions to problems. Hence Copernicus felt he could propose a heliocentric model for no better reason that it seemed more elegant.    Desiree needs to open that box a little. :)|`|X8LNbaKQaa	It is a useful analogy.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Science by definition is the study of the natural universe in natural terms. The supernatural lies totally outside the purview of science, and science therefore cannot make a valid statement about it pro or con.  The only thing science could discover by opening that box would be its own inadequacy to address any questions contained within.
rlthTYFmaa	Yes it allowed a greater degree of free thinking and inventivenes in general and in particular the first production lines were making guns dureing the English Civil War for the Parliamentarians who were fighting against a potentially Catholic king    Seriously the other posters here know nothing, one is saying the steam engine led to the industrial revolution when obviously it's a product of it    another says 1500's. I'm thinking that's a little before the time of the industrial revolution, you do realise that no one said right we are going to have an industrial revolution don't you? It was a gradual shift in the way people constructed things and gradual improvement in technology evolveing over hundreds of years and culminateing in the steam engine|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	The Protestant movement started in the 1500's.

I think the plague had more to do with it. Newton had to leave school and spend all his time along thinking for years - that led to a tremendous advancement in pure science. You could make more of an argument that these advancements in science led to advances in technology (like the steam engine which was major for the industrial revolution).
AA10455120	I would not go. The only myths I know of it, imply at the very least danger, and at the most, certain death/torture.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	Considering one person sometimes didn't return during the actual rites of the Wild Hunt in bygone days, I'm not so sure I'd want to be into it, but then the Wild Hunt as a ritual was "man thing" with the person having the "accident" being the sacrifice. There are pagan circles that do celebrate the Wild Hunt these days, though, without including the serrendipitous human sacrifice part, of course.|`|90MwwrSeaa	I am familiar with the Wild Hunt, and who presides over it depends on which mythology you use as a source. I like the connection it has to hell hounds, the headless horseman, and Diana (because I like Artemis). I haven't studied it in detail, however, so I have yet to separate the modern and romantic beliefs from solid history. It is on my list, though.    It would be a cool thing to observe from a distance, but I think I would decline to participate. LOL
e08zWhUjaa	i know exactly what you mean.. like that guy in the movie "camp" he knew he was attractive, he knew the other camp mate had a crush on him so he continually flirted with both sides of the issue never really wanting a gay fling just being energized by the fact that a guy found him extremely hot...    it hasn't happened to me but I have seen it happen with other people i know... its usually detrimental to any friendship because they are really deep down inside being really turned on by the guy and wanting him.. and he really is only toying with their emotions to the point of making them feel bad about themselves so he can feel good... not a good situation overall.. the gay guy constantly thinking that "he may be gay and maybe he really wants me..

He has slowed down a lot as he's gotten older (he's 27 now)|`|XmJZkFuMaa	It depends on their level of homosexuality in my opinion.  If they're completely and 100% homosexual, then no matter what they do that's something they're going to live with.  Just like my lungs were damaged as a baby and it's something I have to live with.  Just like someone who was born with a physical deformity has to live with it.  Can God heal it?  I think so, eventually, but that they shouldn't live their lives trying to make that change happen.  It's part of their life here and now, and the healing may not come until the next life.    If, though, they are like a 2-3-4-5 on the scale, then they may find healing in this life.  I believe that no matter how gay a man or woman is, they can find spiritual healing in Christ, in that sort of love that only God gives, unconditional and understanding in the problems and trials we have here.    I still don't believe that homosexual behavior should be engaged in in this life.  But I am not naive enough to think that all gays could be fixed, if they just tried and trusted in God.  Sometimes we're meant to live with an affliction.  Sometimes it's not meant to be healed now.|`|bEeozqacaa	There is nothing wrong with homosexuality  There is something fictional about god though.|`|yMqWvG8naa	Could they change with the help of unicorns?

God is able to do all things, exceedingly above what we can even imagine or think of as humans. I have known of people personally, and read about others, who have left the homosexual lifestyle after giving their lives to Christ.    I heard one man's story recently. He said that he engaged in the homosexual lifestyle as a teen to be accepted. He did not find acceptance anywhere else. Kids in school called him weird (because he didn't seem to have any girls around him and was a loner); he said that he started to notice boys more because the girls completely ignored him, and he felt like there was something wrong with him because girls did not approach him. He said that to engage in the homosexual lifestyle, he had to either get high or very drunk before going to gay clubs or engaging in sexual relations with other men. He was able to find God by stumbling upon a church because he was so depressed and suicidal, and had started to question his lifestyle and his true desires for men. It would be easy to say that he probably just woke up one day and felt disgusted all on his own, but it is equally easy to say that God put that spirit of recognition in him.|`|qbelhflAaa	Nope.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	They don't need to change.

According to the Bible writers a positive sign of the impending end of times before Jesus return to Earth that hardly any Christian talks about and those who do are totally opposed to it is the FULL UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION OF SODOM to the way that it was just before its destruction!!! This FACT in the Bible proves that some high profile and politically influential Clergy persons and Preachers are PROMOTING HOMOPHOBIA on their own initiative! They are a bunch of wanking bigots some of them are gay in the closet like Ted Haggard!    Ezekiel 16:[48-49], [53], [55] (NIV) [48-49] As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you* (*what JERUSALEM did! Most Christians refuse to agree with God that according to the Bible writers JERUSALEM IS FAR MORE SINFUL THAN SODOM EVER WAS...!) and your daughters have done. Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom* (*Christian bigots ought to read the Bible more carefully to find out what was wrong with Sodom!): She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy...* (*Neither God the Father nor his Son Jesus Christ EVER MENTIONED THAT THE SIN OF SODOM was homosexuality! Jesus is making favorable statements about SODOM all along --Mat 10:15, 11:24, Mar 6:11, Luc 10:12) [53] "However, I* (*God) will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them [55] And your sisters, SODOM with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, WILL RETURN TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE* (*this is an UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION of Sodom. The Sodomites are not called to repent at all!); and you and your daughters will return to what you were before.    Obviously, God is clearly saying that the destruction of Sodom was a mistake, but the powerful Christian Clergy advisers to our secular leaders on gay issues are promoting a doctrine of cruel religious hatred toward law abiding minorities!  The Bible writers admit that God came up with homosexuality as part of the creation package!    Jeremiah 13:23 (KJV) Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?...    NEVER!!! So the gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and so on CANT POSSIBLE CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE!!! There is no such precedent anywhere in any in Bible story! The Jewish Bible writers admit that Jerusalem is far more sinful than Sodom! (Is it because of stories like the Priest and her lover in Judges 19-21?) The Bible God is confessing that Sodom and Gomorrah will be fully and unconditionally RESTORED to what they were BEFORE THEIR DESTRUCTION!!! There is no call for repentance AT ALL for any Sodomite before the full restoration of Sodom! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen? I know most preachers HATE THE FACTS WRITTEN IN THEIR OWN BIBLE BECAUSE THEIR INCOME DEPENDS ON GOING ALONG WITH WHAT THE CHRISTIANS OUGHT TO BELIEVE! The Mormons are wising up to this fact, too! Christianity is about the most dishonest and powerful religion in the world second only to Islam!    According to the Bible writers the restoration of SODOM must be taking place right now before the 2nd coming of Jesus!  If so, then there is nothing wrong with the same sex marriages going on in our very days!!! And I wonder why Christians are so passionately AGAINST the fulfillment of Bible prophecies that they dont like. The most popular preachers today are the ones most opposed to TRUE Bible prophecy fulfillment! You must know that the Sodomites were much holier and far more respectful of women than even Righteous Lot was. Lot pledged his virgin daughters to be married to heterosexual SODOMITES who believed in virgin purity until marriage!!! (Gen 19:14) It was Righteous Lot delivering his own virgin daughters for the unrestricted pleasure of some gay Sodomites who were looking for the strange male visitors who INSISTED on spending the night out in the main street of Sodom NOT AT ALL at Lots pad! (Gen 19:2-3) These angels or messengers of God knew where the action in Sodom was at and they wanted to spend the night in the middle of it, but Lot wanted them for himself!  Also, these Guardian(?) Angels didnt know how many people Lot had in his family they didnt come looking for Lot! (Gen 19:12).  Abraham didnt tell them that his nephew Lot lived there. Christians dont pay attention to all the clues written in the Bible! They only know how to feed their traditional homophobic orientation out of this story. Anyway Sodom is destroyed.  Holy Lot lost his wife.  He started to get real drunk and was having sex with his young virgin daughters UNTIL HE GOT THEM PREGNANT! God was so impressed with Lots performance that he bestowed on Lot the Eternal Title of RIGHTEOUSNESS throughout the Bible, Old and New Testaments in triplicate according to the number of the members in the Holy Trinity! Lot was a legal resident of Sodom!    2 Peter 2:7-8 (NIV) and if he* (*God) rescued Lot, a 1) RIGHTEOUS man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men for that 2) RIGHTEOUS man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his 3) RIGHTEOUS soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard.* (*this verse in the Bible shows how hypocritical is the Bible! Even the NT idea about sin is not what the preachers and Christian Clergy peddle nowadays!)    BTW Lot was rescued out of Sodom by accident! No angel came looking for him at all! Christian dishonesty in telling the Bible story of Sodom and Gomorrah is a sham! There is no trace of evidence from any other source outside of the Bible that Sodom ever existed. I just stick to the Bible text! It is so disgusting for Bible believing Christians to hurt and persecute the gay community on a fairy tale!  Now a lot of innocent, but Bible ignorant and Clergy obedient Christian bigots are actually preventing

Not only is that not admirable, but also hypocritical since you can't have both at the same time.    Edit: Kale, actually yes he is the "I'm going to kill you" type of jealous and proved it on many occasions in the OT. There were countless instances where non-believers were struck down or otherwise killed by God's hand or command simply for the fact that they were not his followers.|`|W0Ovbpq0aa	Jealous meaning Zealous. Study study study. Paul uses it in 2 cor 11:2. He says I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy. The greek word is 'zeeloo' meaning zealous.     Look at the Hebrew and the Greek and read multiple versions. This is back slapped in true debate.     Also study the law of jealousies in Num 5 to get a better understanding.     If you really want to be ahead of the game study the multiple types of jealousy.    Type 1: Resentment - Cain and Abel from Genesis.   Type 2: Suspicion of one faithfulness Ex 34:14, Num 5, Num 25:11, Deut 4:24 and so on.  Type 3: Zealous/passion 2 Cor 11:2 & Ex 20:5    Type 2 is love motivated but can still be sinful. It's sinful if one's partner is not unfaithful. However, if someone is truly unfaithful to you like the children of Israel were to God then your SUSPICION IS JUSTIFIED. Now here's where the rubber meets the road. God's suspicion or jealousy is always justified because he saw you be unfaithful.    I've taught this class a few times.     Good question and God loves you.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Jealousy is not necessarily a sin. If I was dating or married I would get jealous if I found my husband or boyfriend was cheating on me...and with good reason!     God's jealousy isn't the oppressive "I'm gonna kill you" type jealousy. He loves us like we're married to Him, and when we "cheat" on Him, so to speak, it breaks His heart.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Jealousy can be shown in two ways.     If I am jealous of your material possessions, I am bad.     But if I am jealous of your moral, intellectual, spiritual, artistic, skillful advancements, so that I too can aspire to compete with you, I think that kind of jealousy is totally different.    Meaning of a word has to be derived from the context.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Another probing question from the master of Godology,you go girl.|`|DArAz67Caa	There is nothing faulty about our creator-----how could you even think such a thing??|`|WfR6AqHiaa	first of all. god abides from the rules. he created us, so cant he do whatever the heck he wants to us?    and again he created us, and if we dont listen to him wouldnt you get  a little mad?|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	NIce...|`|P1Sl55Coaa	Why do you say that jealousy is not admirable?  Do you have some sort of moral standard outside of God?  Think about it.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Actually jealousy is an admirable trait in this context.  Which is God not wanting to share His children with false Gods.  We belong to God and He wants us to love Him.   Is this an evil trait to you?|`|AA11340918	He is jealous and therefore does not want you to worship any other gods but Him. That is not a bad thing. Its like a woman saying that she is Jealous and therefore does not want her husband to be with any other woman but her. You cant say she is a bad person for saying that, she has every right to say that. It is the same with God, he has every right to be jealous, he created us so you should not even think about worshipping any other god but him.|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	Sigh.    I'm ALWAYS explaining and you and yours are never listening.  I grow weary.    You wrote: "Jealousy is not an admirable trait--"  But WAIT A MINUTE, Skippy!  Jealousy, the way humans exhibit it and react to it means it's not a admirable trait to us.  When God says that He is a jealous God then you mean to tell me that you are CERTAIN that His jealousy as a Holy being with perfect knowledge and complete righteousness is like that of an immature 17 year old who is willing to slash her rival's tires?  C'mon!  Please!  You can do better than that!    Atheist are hate filled, yes.  But your hate blinds you to even the most basic flaws in your logic.|`|jR8mclWIaa	If you think that the answers that you get from this question are funny you should ask what the bible means when it says that God is angry.|`|IMENWksEaa	For humans, jealousy is often out of place or misused, like anger. That doesn't mean that never would jealousy be proper. The Bible expresses how God feels about people who have gone their own way resulting in problems for themselves. Deut. 32 : 1 - 52. God's jealousy does not originate from a selfish motive. As an illustration: It is the same kind of jealousy as a good father would have for his children if they were to turn their back on him and go off to live with another family that had no love for them and they would suffer because the" other family" has nothing worthwhile to help the children. Naturally the father of these children would feel jealousy, and it would be right for the situation. God is not faulty in any way, but humans tend to view matters from their own standpoint so that some things appear to them as being misplaced or unclear. Isaiah 55 : 8, 9.also read Isaiah 48 : 17, 18. God wants to instruct us for our own good if we are willing to listen and learn about him. * Just like jealousy, anger can have a place, but often it is misused and out of control by humans. Feeling angry about something that is unjust ,or angry  about someone lying to you, for example, is not wrong, but what will you do with the anger, is the issue. Many times though, people get angry at things for a selfish reason, or for something imagined, or if they don't get their way. Then they quickly react and carry it further with actions that they later regret.
cHUadRYeaa	Been there, done that.  What I did was like tell her straight out and like she got a little nervous and didn't talk to me and i would still talk to her. But like one day, I just got tired of her crap and didn't like her anymore and she would try to talk to me and I would like talk to her, but like make it seem like I didn't care and she was wanting me more.  Now she wants me, but I don't want her anymore. What i think you should do is like don't call her one time or two and then she'll ask you and then you just say well umm i just had things to do and she will want you like the way you were like always there. Hopefully that will work. Good luck. :)|`|2a16a948aee20ae878dae8776bca92cfaa	if she wanted you, she wouldnt be like "ill talk to you in a few weeks" that is just unacceptable, respect yourself and save yourself from heartbreak and forget about her. move on, there will be someone in the near future that will take the time out of their day for you and youll like them soo much more i promise you that!|`|YIOIUZZlaa	she is playing hard to get you should do the exact same thing she is doing to you and show her how it feels|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	girls are really hard to figure out...i wish i could be more help|`|zub6aYxHaa	are you sure that she is bi, cause she could be messing with your emotions. have you seen her with other girls, get her backgroung information and see what shes up to.  maybe the good thing to do would be to tell her how you feel.|`|5wrtEn2Oaa	well she probably likes u but doesn't know do u like her and doesn't want to get hurt

Sarcasm is useful to shine the light on that person and away from you.|`|IbbQK960aa	hurtful of others|`|AA11722373	I really think it depends on who is being sarcastic as to how they mean it. Some use it as a joke while others use it as a way to let someone know how they feel without coming right out and saying how they feel. But all in all it can and for the most part does hurt peoples feelings. This is one of those cases where I believe in treating other folks the way that I want to be treated. But even at that, a person can only take so much from any one person and if the right button is pushed, the receiver can and will blow.     It happens to me every day and by my own mom. I try to over look it as much as possible. Some times it is really hard to deal with it. I hate to say this but she has in fact pushed my button a couple of times.    I have in fact done it a few times in the past, but I have learned how I would feel if it was said to me. So now I watch what I say to folks. If they start pushing my button, I walk away from that person (if I can) and give my self cool down time. If I can't get away, I change the subject as fast as I can.|`|66ATKuknaa	Sarcasm can sometimes be used to insult someone when one is too cowardly to say what they really mean.

In other words, it's their defense mechanism for their insecurity (or over inflated ego).    I do not respond sarcastically to anyone, it is simply rude.
SXmlCXs4aa	I was calling myself Wiccan for almost thirteen to fourteen  years...now, I feel that no longer fits. I think of myself more as an Agnostic Pagan Witch. I am coming to believe that there is a larger 'cosmic' force, with both female and male traits. I respect the myths, and see each pantheon as part of this same force. Just another piece of the puzzle.  )o( Blessed Be! ~ Whillow  Witch of 15 years, forever evolving in my beliefs...going where they take me...not conforming to labels|`|UxooffHZaa	The gods and goddesses can appear however they want. They are shapeshifters.    Don't ask what you can be. You don't need permission. If you are a Buddhist Witch, then you are. If it's not possible, you'll discover that after trying to amalgamate.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	you don't have to believe in the god and goddess as literal entities to be wiccan, the idea is to respect the balance of nature.  but, buddhism does allow you to practice any beliefs that don't contradict the purpose of letting go of attachments.  there are some aspects of witchcraft that might conflict with that.    my god has a human form, but that is only one of his many forms.  the goddess hasn't manifested herself, tho she has made her presence known.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	I came through a path of Zen Buddhism, so I know  what you're talking about there... in terms of opening  your mind, freeing yourself from preconceived ideas  and seeing things as they really are.    That's excellent training. It should be the first requirement  of anyone's spiritual journey... but it's not a religion,  it's an esoteric philosophy... or you might say it's a   vehicle but not a destination.    Next, In my opinion, you should not adopt a belief in   any deity until you have a direct personal experience  with them.    Finally, I believe that the male god is false and that  only the Goddess is real. So my advice to you is to   ask the Goddess to show Herself to you, and don't   waste time on the god. Do an offering before bed and   then sleep on it.Make sure to avoid anything that can   reduce your psychic sensitivity, such as caffeen,   alcohol, recreational drugs, etc.     Most people have a direct personal experience within   a few days. If not, contact me and I will work with you  if you are sincere.

Keep reading about spirituality and other religions and you will find your path. Don't worry how to label yourself.|`|NxL4C1DMaa	I myself find it easier to identify the God and Goddess with a human figure, just makes it easier for me to identify with them. But in actuality, they are probably more a force of energy, rather than any kind of form.    I had too many issues with not believing in a few of the wiccan beliefs that I just gave up identifying myself as wiccan (as I could be insulting other wiccans) therefore I just refer to myself as a Witch. Labels are what you make them...they can also hurt you too, so one must be careful when choosing a lable for themselves. One must be ready to discuss anything that may come up when one reveals their label to another. You must be able to answer any questions that arise.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	As an post-modern magician who is also a Vedantist and who has been invited to be the high priestess of a Wiccan/Pagan coven, no; I do not believe that God/Goddess have a form. They are life, consciousness, and energy itself. All This is their form.  We think of them as having iconic forms and attributes to relate to them in a personal and symbolic way. The iconic forms of deities usually are a collection of symbols.  The appearance, dress, and accessories of the deity all have symbolic meaning that are meant to be meditated on so that the practitioner can understand and integrate ideas and aspects about the deity--or better, the idea or ideal personified by a deity.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	I do not believe my deities are confined to having a head, two arms and two legs, if that is what you are asking. Those are physical characterisitics we assign to non-physical entities in an attempt to better relate to them.  I do tend to envision them as human-looking, and have some statuary giving them human forms, but I understand that those as symbols representing my deities, not objective appearances of them.    Simply believing in the Spirit of life is not particularly Wiccan.  Wiccan ritual is structured around the acknowledgement of deities.  Quite simply, there are other religious frameworks that would probably better address your spiritual needs than Wicca.    I see nothing wrong with being a Buddhist witch.|`|2GK3mBeuaa	Seeing as my Gods were also my ancestors I would certainly hope they're human looking.      I think Taoism fits what you're saying better than Buddhism.      You can be a Witch and be of just about any religion.  To be a Witch is not religious, however to be Wiccan is.      Good luck on your spiritual journey.  I know you weren't asking for this, but I like to butt in and be nosy =P.  When I was searching for a religion I could have cut out a lot searching if I had sat down and written down specific things that I wanted and didn't want from a religion.  I've found that there's a lot less searching this way.  Also, you already have in front of you the backbone of what you believe--it kind of gets rid of that lost and wondering feeling.  Good luck!!
6aIuZZi7aa	It's a relatively simple concept, which is that whatever energy you send out into the Universe, is what energy you will attract into your life. Some people "use" the Law of Attraction by sending out energy to attract what they want in their life.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Here's another way to state it:    You reap what you sow.|`|VBgzgoUMaa	Well if  you are talking about "The Secret".........it just means......that which you hold in your mind to be TRUE........produces an energy within your sub-conscious mind. It is believed that the SUB Conscious MIND is part of the Collective universal mind and therefore everything from the BIG BANG moment is all connected.----since it all  STEMS from the same common POINT it is connected in a form known to some as MIND and therefore everything that EVER HAPPENED and WILL is all the same THING....as if Everything since the Beginning of TIME or BIG BANG or Whatever you wish to call it IS ONE THING purely Spherical Like the shape of the Planet the SUN etc........all ONE THING and therefore what you believe has an ENERGY that attracts like things to it. It is really pretty simple once you see how nothing can be completely separate from any thing else, and that our THOUGHTS are a form of ENERGY which can neither be created nor destroyed and therefore ETERNAL...........etc.|`|2LT51yrFaa	whatever you feel like , it's exactly what's gonna happen to you.|`|aBHY2iXraa	Remember when you were a little kid and thought that if you wished hard enough, you could turn into a princess (or whatever). That's the law of attraction...    It has been tested by thousands of dupes but "verified", only by those who are selling the system (which just about says it all, don't you think?)|`|RC5RAzykaa	The Law of Attraction says people's thoughts (both conscious and unconscious) dictate the reality of their lives, whether or not they're aware of it. Essentially "if you really want something and truly believe it's possible, you'll get it", but putting a lot of attention and thought onto something you don't want means you'll probably get that too.    Test it, you will find it unverifyable.    However, I have had some success in my youth with conceptualization of goals.  The discipline I used is outlined in the book "Psycho-Cybernetics".  Basically it is self hypnotism.  I wouldn't try it now, as I believe it unGodly.    However, I will say that the things you SAY are important in the spiritual realm and affects your life on earth.    1st Corinthians 14:15  So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.    1st Corinthians 14:16 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is] without signification.    Ephesians 2:2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:    Satan is the prince of the power of the air, and we speak into the air, so what we say either gives him power to affect us, or restrains him (Prayer in Christ restrains him)    We should always be careful what we say    James 3:6  And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.    James 3:8  But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.    It is better to keep quiet.|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	gravity|`|0lh4Cxx4aa	I don't know where it originated from or how it's been tested, but the basic premise is that you attract energy from the universe, and basically what you think about is what you attract. So to get what you want in life, you need to send those thoughts out for the universe to pick up on. But it works about anything you think about, so you don't want to think about what you don't want.|`|PRAd6MWwaa	law of attraction is the theory of if you believe and hope for things to happen than they will come to you.  like visualizing yourself thin if you are overweight and eventually you will bring in "thinness" and you'll loose weight.  that's the best way i can describe it.  It's a lot like when people say "if you're positive than positive things will happen to you"|`|fitsd4FGaa	The law of attraction says that if you don't have any legs then all you have to do is visualize yourself having legs and the universe will bring them to you.    Edit:    It also claims that the reason you don't have legs is because you've attracted leglessness to your life.  There is nothing but attraction so what you've attracted (or contracted...lol) is totally your fault.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	It's bogus nonsense, and will lead to your destruction.
vs5YwpzWaa	I'm with you.   Secret handshakes would be awesome.  But how would all the people in the closest learn the handshake, its not like we could post it on the internet (that wouldn't be a very good secret). Plus you got all the haters who would try and learn the shake to make it easier to hate.     But if you can perfect the glowing/seeing light thing I'd buy into that. (But I'd prefer green over purple)|`|H4bOkSTaaa	i agree plus i think it would be kind of funny but the approaching someone to do the handshake would be also awkward maybe a random word that only we knew like in the movie 21 or a signal     I think the person would have a rainbow glow but that's very clever|`|F3CMtEcraa	High school would be soooo much easier that way!|`|iorYnGrAaa	That would be AWESOME!

ATPPWOpWaa	Of the ancient writings in all of antiquity it is the Judeo Christian scriptures that are by far the most numerous and of which the copies agree with one another.  There are no other ancient texts that even come close to the Biblical scriptures in number and redundancy.                People assume that the Bible is made from error filled copies to yet more errored copies and on and on.  Winding up with a hodge podge of what once was the true scriptures.  This is far from the truth.   There are some 27,000 ancient Judeo Christian texts, parchments and scrolls.   There is absolutely no evidence that the Bible has been revised, edited, or tampered with in any systematic manner. The sheer volume of Biblical manuscripts makes it simple to recognize any attempts to distort Gods Word. There is no major doctrine of the Bible that is put in doubt as a result of the minor differences that exist between manuscripts.      Lastly,  when people say that the Bible has degenerated from 2,000 years of recopying they fail to see that the Bible is written in about 200 different languages.  And if you retranslated them back into the original Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic they still agree.    The Bible is the most attacked book in history.  It is the most popular book in history and still is today.    Matthew 24  35Heaven and earth will pass away, but my(Jesus)words will never pass away.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	Herodotus|`|AA11096726	None come close to the Bible. None have ever been so scrutinized, critiqued, attacked and still retains its integrity.

Instead, he will be hurled like a ball, to die in a distant land. In this there is a warning to all of those entrusted with authority among Gods people. Abuse of power will lead to the loss of that authority and possibly to banishment.    18 How, though, will Shebna be removed from his position? Through Isaiah, Jehovah explains: It must occur in that day that I will call my servant, namely, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah. And I will clothe him with your robe, and your sash I shall firmly bind about him, and your dominion I shall give into his hand; and he must become a father to the inhabitant of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I will put the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, and he must open without anyones shutting, and he must shut without anyones opening. (Isaiah 22:20-22) Replacing Shebna, Eliakim will be given the stewards official garments along with the key of the house of David. The Bible uses the term key to symbolize authority, government, or power. (Compare Matthew 16:19.) In ancient times, a kings adviser, entrusted with the keys, might have general supervision of the royal chambers, even deciding on candidates for the kings service. (Compare Revelation 3:7,?8.) Thus, the office of steward is important, and much is expected of whoever serves in it. (Luke 12:48) Shebna may be capable, but because he is unfaithful, Jehovah will replace him|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I read it and can not figure it out.  Maybe it made sense in light of some sort of events or conditions that were current at that the time.   Some Biblical writings can be understood only in light of knowledge about the history of that time.  Maybe this is an example of something that can not be easily understood unless you are very familiar with the culture and current events at  the time it was written.  This is an example of why I think it is best to read the Bible in consultation with the Catholic Church.  Good luck with your reading and studies.  Peace be with you.|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	I have no idea just from this text, why don't you read what was written before then and make a conclusion? Hint, it's not about Jesus.|`|Bi1W5U35aa	When they hung people on the cross they drove nails through his hands, and a nail through his wrist, a nail in a sure place so  he wouldn't fall. It was speaking of Christ.|`|GBKaftrJaa	He's talking about Shebna, the palace administrator.    You might want to try a different version of the bible that's easier to read.  We don't use the word "thus" that often so that's a pretty old version you are reading.  The more accurate translations are the newer ones.  Anything translated before 1947 is based on scrolls dating no earlier than 1000AD.  The translations after that date were based on scrolls of the bible dated as early as 200 to 400AD.    Isaiah, and all the prophets, talked about things in their current day as well as things in the near future and the distant future. So when someone is named you can take that literally.

You need to form your own understanding about yourself as a person, and consulting with bisexual websites will help you understand yourself even more.
yMqWvG8naa	It doesn't matter.  Christians are as likely to be right about Jesus as the ancient greeks were about Zeus, or atheists are about the flying spaghetti monster...

Thank goodness some people even care about that.  You must not be a regular church goer or else they would have written hell-fire and damnation into your brain.     All Gods creation will be reconciled to Him.  Fire is actually a physical symbol that describes refinement.  The way heat destroys ... bacteria, lets say.  The burning bush was on fire,  made holy, but wasn't ruined.  What God will destroy is the worldly, fleshly sin - not the soul or person.  We will all be made whole and worthy.  Aint He great?  Read the new testament and notice all the words "ALL" when talking about salvation, etc.  A few examples follow.  Also, the words   "eternal" and "everlasting" were interpreted wrong. They actually mean "a period of time".  So the refinement will only last for a period of time.   God is as wonderful as you could imagine.  He'll forgive ... everything.  Now isn't that good news?    1 Tim 4:10     it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God who is teh savior of ALL MEN, espeically of believers (not exclusively believers)    1 Tim 2:3       this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior, who desires ALL MEN TO BE SAVED (and God gets what he desires.

The only way to get into heaven is by believing in Jesus without adding any of your own works.     We're all sinners. Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins, because Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.     All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even ONE of your sins. All the trying to be a "good person" won't pay for even ONE of your sins. Doing "religious activites" won't pay for even ONE of your sins.     Either Jesus pays for your sins, or you pay for them in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.    So believe in Jesus as God and Savior without adding any of your own works, and you're saved, that simple (John 3:16). :)|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	Nope. Good thing heaven isn't real!|`|5tMCDu8gaa	LOLZ!

On the other hand, if it is a fundamentalist view that only those who accept the Christ can enter Heaven, then atheists would be S.O.L.  By the way, in Dante's Inferno, atheists don't even make it all the way into Hell, but are stuck in the Vestibule, or at worst, the first circle, which is Limbo.  Those who sow discord, such as rabidly hateful fundamentalists, will find themselves down in the bowels of the 8.9 circle of Hell.

We cannot by good works, or obeying rules go to heaven, because we are not holy, and God is. Jesus is holy, and died for our sins in our place so that we can have eternal life.  If you are an Atheist, and turn to Jesus and believe, you can be forgiven of that.|`|99xBLoLcaa	That would be a no because there's no such place, therefore nobody has ever gone there nor ever will.|`|d7FP0VmDaa	can a xtian go to Valhalla or Nirvana?|`|AA12042448	Reality is not affected in the slightest by our perception of it.  Heaven is a reality, as is God Who lives there.  What makes you think He is going to honor human ideas that contradict His?  He's set the criteria for entrance to Heaven and made them clear -- and He isn't going to change them.  Only absolutely perfect holiness can be tolerated there; no sin whatsoever has a place in God's Presence.  The only way for a human to become perfectly holy is to accept Jesus' atoning work on the cross and trust Him for forgiveness.  His perfect righteousness is then credited to the human's account and our sin is credited to His.  He's already paid for it.  This is done through faith while the human is still here on earth.  That is the only way it works.      The good news is that your hypothetical atheist has the same chance at repentance and forgiveness as everyone else.  It only requires faith.|`|dSFZHrLJaa	No. In order to be accepted into heaven, you have to have Jesus in you heart, and you cant have Jesus in your heart unless you truly believe he exists.    I have a question concerning your proof theory...    I used to be exactly like you. I grew up in a strong Christian family; my parents taught classes at church and were very involved in the community. All my brothers and sisters seemed to believe so freely, but I never could fully understand it. Finally, I confronted my parents, demanding real proof of Gods presence. These were my exact words, "I'm sorry, but I don't believe. There is nothing leading me to believe that there is a God." And she stared at me for a while, and finally she answered, "Your right. There is no proof, and I could be totally and completely wrong, but I would have nothing to loose if that were the case. If your wrong, you have EVERYTHING to loose."    So now, I want you to think about that.       Hope you have a blessed day : )|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Since heaven doesn't exist, nobody can go there.
OLL9Cdbtaa	You know what? You can't. If you hate your job the best I can tell you to do is get some training in another area by going back to college (or going to college if you haven't been). You really can't learn to love something that you hate, but you can look at the fact that your making money and if you've made friends with your co-workers you can think about that too.    As far as your boss is concerned, you can be happy with the thought that karma will get him back for his greediness.
zZxX5PXBaa	Yep, they sound a bit generic. a lot of them have echoes of well known fiction or real names ... a famous spiritual writer is Eckhart Tolle, for instance, which you have exactly. the 'Ham' bit comes up in Tolkien. Foley is a fairly common surname. Blaglest reminds me of Slartibarftast, from Hitchhiker's Guide.    The other problem is there's no consistency to them, they don't sound like they come from the same culture or universe or belong in the same language. And even names from different worlds have to translate into the language of the narrator or the hero, and thus acquire some coherence.    My suggestion would be pick a country with a language far removed from your own, and get an atlas with very detailed maps of that country, and look at the names of small towns and villages. You'll come up with names you wouldn't otherwise invent, and they will have a coherence. You might even spend a while learning the basics of that language too. Tolkien did this to some extent, in that a lot of his names draw on both Celtic and Germanic / Norse mythology, and because these are mythologies and languages that had resonances for many of his original (European) readers, he was able to play intelligently with the sounds and syllables to give them meaning withing his mythology (Sauron kind of goes with Saruman, for instance).    Otherwise, you 'invent' all the time out of what you already know, and it's never as random as you'd like. Like trying to make up 'random' sequences of numbers, you just can't do it, bits of your phone number get in there, or your car licence number, or birthdate, or street number, you  just can't stop it happening.    Good luck.
2x37XgxCaa	If a genuine Christian becomes so distraught that he commits suicide, I think he will still be saved and go to heaven.  BUT, I think when he stands before God, he will be ashamed of his lack of trust (trusting God with his problem or depression).|`|208557bb6eec298af05daee61976e842aa	There is no punishment for suicide.  Such an idea was concocted by that evil twisted reprobate Mobius.|`|sj2CgV6Eaa	Well, I believe that it depends on what kind of person you were in life. People used to think that when a person took one's own life, they would go to Hell (because God said that we shouldn't kill anyone (and that includes ourselves)), however, now that we understand the reasons behind a person's decision to commit suicide (usually extreme depression) we know that the person is not in their right mind, and therefore shouldn't be judged for the decisions they make. However, nobody truly knows but God and the people who have killed themselves, so it's pointless to speculate.|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	The judgment of God will be fair and just to all. I think ultimately suicide shows a lack of faith, and for this reason people who kill themselves will have to answer for it.      Have you ever read the Lost Books of Eden? If you believe, there is several instances where Adam and Eve, being distraught over their expulsion from the garden, kill themselves only to be brought back to life by the "word" of God. Why? Because they hadn't been punished enough by the separation? No, it was because the salvation of Christ for ALL MANKIND comes through him and he came through the line of David, who came through the line of Seth, son of Adam and Eve.|`|IjwOIRcmaa	Well God gave you a life and you are meant to do something. Possibly whatever trial one's going through is simply meant to prepare them to preform something greater. Committing suicide would be failing in the point of your life.

I think I had that for dinner last night|`|yrwqHlW2aa	Suicide is a very VERY selfish act.  It comes when someone is so focused on how miserable their life is they can't consider any ones feelings and how they would feel to loose someone special to them.    It is up to God how many days we have on earth.  I would not want to stand before God with my last act on earth being murder and selfish inconsideration.|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	I am NOT trying to talk anyone into committing suicide.  But honestly?  I have heard it all of my life that suicide is an unforgivable sin.  When you push these people for the reason why, it's not that scripture says that.  As you rightfully point out, it does not.  People REASON that IF you kill yourself then you cannot ever ask for forgiveness; so ... well, you get the picture.    But if dying having committed a sin is reason to send you to hell then lots of otherwise faithful Christians would have died with sins on their record that they had not confessed to and repented from.  They would be doomed to hell too!      The Bible does NOT say that you must have confessed to and repented from that very last sin before you die in order to get to heaven.  It's just silly.    But make no mistake, I DO believe that committing suicide IS a sin and is that REALLY how you want to go meet your maker?|`|vDr5aROwaa	There is nothing in the bible that states that if you commit suicide you are going to hell. I don't know where these people get that you are going to hell for anything other then rejecting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. That is the only thing that will take you to hell when you die. Not even sin. If sin would make us go to hell, then we are all going to hell, cause I'll guarantee you that there is no one that doesn't sin. I don't care how righteous you might think you are, no one is that righteous, even the bible tells us " there non righteous, not one, we all come short of glory of God. As we grow in God's word, we see that we sin less, but we will never be sinless in this life. If we could have been sinless, then Jesus Christ would not have had to come and die on the cross for us.|`|tkgvrqjHaa	God gave you life   its not your choice to take it away   God chooses when you die   if you kill yourself, its hell   your body is a gift, dont abuse it|`|szeFBYDmaa	Why shouldn't I answer?    According to the christian faith taking life is a ticket to hell unless you repent. You CANNOT repent for taking your own life for you are already dead at the time you need to repent for. Also I believe it IS stated that this is the one unforgivable sin.    Regardless, from an atheists perspective. You cease but those closest to you go on for the rest of their lives with your memory haunting them. Giving rise to questions like "Why didn't I see this in them?", "Could I have done something to prevent this?" and "Why did they feel this way?", Although they will sit predominantly in their minds at first over time this will become less frequent until it becomes whole years before this thought pops up to torture their minds once more.

A person has to be deeply troubled to commit or even consider suicide. Murder is the intentional killing of another person, not ones own self.  If it were a sin God would have said so. The idea that suicide is a sin, comes from the thought that the body is a temple of the Lord. And that every thing we do to harm the body is a sin. This notion is total nonsense. If that were true many things we do in everyday life are harmful to our bodies. Therefor we sin with every breath of polluted air.  God bless|`|3r252UIRaa	Consequences are giving up your human life and being reborn either an animal, a human in very bad condition, or even one of the hell realms. If you commit suicide, you'll suffer even more in your next life.|`|AA11232725	Jesus didn't mention suicide. The question is, is a person who kills them self doing it because they don't trust God to sustain them in this life? Is it because some murderous satanic spirit is speaking lies into their thought life and discouraging them so that they don't persevere in their faith and fulfill God's plan for their life?    Now if someone has lived a full life of service to the Lord and they are being kept alive by medical equipment, that's a different story. But I know of people who seemed to be saved, who were serving the Lord, and because of depression they committed suicide.     I don't think that they lost their salvation. But I know that they lost a battle with the Devil and they won't receive the eternal reward that they might have received when they stand before the judgment seat of Christ.    2 Corinthians 5:9  Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him.  10  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.|`|lHg9ZqwJaa	death...|`|99hfFssXaa	committing suicide is taking the life of one of god's children and is therefore murder.

Don't you care about them?|`|oxUFlfPvaa	My theory is that if you decide to take your own life, that you weren't really a believer in the first place.  So, if you commit suicide, then you will go to hell, not because suicide is a sin, but because you didn't have faith in Jesus.

The first Wedigo was a mortal who was betrayed by his sweetheart, In revenge for the  treachery, he slew  his lover and are her Heart. Rather than the warmth of revenge his heart was in turn, turned to Ice.   Wedigo only comes out on full moons.  And that is the long and short of a Wendigo.

Native American versions of the creature spoke of a giant Spirit, over fifteen feet tall, which had once been human but had been transformed into a creature by the use of magic. The Wendigo is usually described to have glowing eyes, large yellow fangs and long tongues. Some Wendigos are said to be covered from head to toe with hair and has a yellowish skin. One story says the creature can only be seen head-on, because it is too thin to be seen from the side. Wendigo has a very large appetite for human flesh.Algonquian-speaking tribes of Native Americans, the Wendigo is a malevolent supernatural creature. It is usually described as a giant with a heart of ice; sometimes it is thought to be entirely made of ice. Its body is skeletal and deformed, with missing lips and toes.

Otherwise, if you can't work out right now, try to phone a friend to talk things through.    Good luck.  I hope you feel better.|`|AA12006309	I breathe.  Seriously.  It's a mindfulness meditation technique.|`|ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	I usually listen to music. Any kind.  Sometimes I listen to my heavy metal and just connect with the harsh vocals and emotion, sometimes I listen to something more mellow and try to focus on that and calm down.     If I have free time (which I won't have for a while thanks to college), then I go on a hike. There's the woods behind the dorms and I'll just take off for a few hours to wherever my feet will take me. At first it's kind of a march to just hike as far out as possible, grumbling in my head about everything and using the energy from my anger to hike on. Eventually the anger dies out and I'm just so enamored with everything outside that I continue on just to see what lies further on. It's not a pissed off death march anymore, but a stroll through nature and a little adventure to see what I can find. I've found various things that few others seem to know about. I've also encountered a lot of wildlife.     I love it because the woods calm me and bring me back to a balance where everything is okay and I find myself unable to be angry. When I find that special beauty in everything around me out there, it's too difficult to be consumed by anger. Those woods have become my special place, every part of it.|`|UHfjV57raa	Hah.

That works wonders!|`|iorYnGrAaa	Ask your friend to play dodgeball. >:D|`|Ki90Irkcaa	Calm down. Before your anger gets the best of you, take it down a notch. The neurological process that triggers anger lasts just two seconds.[1] The rest is up to you. Either the anger response can be amplified, or it can be defused. As soon as you feel angry, do one or a combination of the following to nip the anger in the bud:      Breathe deeply from your diaphragm. Breathing shallowly from the chest won't help you relax.[2]   Tell yourself, in a soft voice, to "relax" or "take it easy" as you're breathing deeply.   Close your eyes and visualize a setting or memory that calms you, like lying in bed, or floating in water.   Avoid extreme words. Avoid words such as always or never . They are always finding fault with me or They never even helped me once before. These words are usually not true and using them can amplify the anger and cause the situation to worsen.   Avoid the temptation to vent. People are commonly advised to act out their aggression by doing things like screaming into a pillow, or hitting a punching bag. This is called catharsis, and recent studies suggests that it actually fuels hostility, rather than minimize it.[3]   Lighten up. Many times, when we look back at what we were angry about, it really is ridiculous and silly, even though we certainly didn't see it that way at the time! Injecting a little bit of humor into your perspective (after that initial wave of anger has passed) can help you break out of your angry mood.      10 funny counts - Forget about the old fashioned count to 10 you are fine talk. Use the 10 funny counts instead. When you are angry, just count1 funny clown, 2 funny pig, 3 funny bananas, 4 funny red nose boss, 5 funny short giraffe" etc. Our brain works better with pictures, and when you say something funny, you will tend to imagine it in the mind.      Visualize something funny you are angry at. Are you angry with your boss because he yelled at you for something that you didnt do? Picture him fatter, balloon him up, put a pair of dorky spectacles on him, a big red nose that makes him keep falling over when he is yelling. Are you able to get angry at the new mental picture of your boss now? Hard to do!   Do a comical impression of yourself when you get angry. Throw your hands up in the air, shake them wildly, and go "GRRRRRRRRRRRR".   Do something that makes it impossible to take yourself seriously. Do a pirouette (who can feel angry while spinning around?) or a silly dance, like the chicken dance or the macarena.   Redirect the angry energy. Anger is often an energizing emotion (because of the hormones that are released) and that physical energy has to go somewhere! The most constructive way to redirect that energy is to tire yourself out with exercise. Run, jump rope, do jumping jacks, or do push-ups until you're too exhausted to feel angry anymore.   Work it out. This is the most important step. Once the anger has subsided, don't just completely forget about it. Whatever made you angry will probably make you angry again, unless you address and resolve it when you're calm. More importantly, any residual anger can turn inward and manifest itself in hypertension, high blood pressure, or depression. It may also return as passive-aggressive behavior (getting back at people indirectly; you might not even realize you're doing it) or you may start to become a cynical and bitter person overall.[2] So take this opportunity to understand yourself, and be proactive.      If your anger is related to a specific person:      Practice Nonviolent Communication   Give a Feedback Sandwich   Deal with Impossible People   If your anger is related to circumstances you can't control, like actions by people you don't know, or a canceled flight:      Be Optimistic   Be Thankful   Be Laid Back   If your anger is caused by thoughts about the past or future (anxiety, worries, grudges, etc.):      Live in the Moment   Get Closure   Forgive         [edit] TipsTime Out! - Arguing with someone? Is the situation getting out of hand? Most likely, both of you are not too calm and in the right mind to talk about anything. Ask for a time out, take whatever time off you feel that is appropriate and bring yourself to a level where you are calm and relax before you talk about anything. When you ask for a time out, be sure to let the person know that you still want to converse with them, and tell them you will schedule a meeting to further discuss the issue.   Keep a book on recording your anger. Find out the patterns and triggers that lead you to feel angry. Once you identify the problem, you can then find a solution.   Remember that anger is usually about misplaced expectations: you expected a person to act one way and they did something else. Or you expected one outcome from a situation, and the result was a very different outcome. When you put it in perspective, anger becomes much easier to deal with. So what it boils down to, deal with people or situations without expectations of be

wxBFZ41Taa	You can own land as a priest. Parish priests do not take a vow of poverty. But they don't make a lot of money either. Plus you'd need to be near your parish. You may be able to incorporate farming with helping others in some way. Perhaps a Catholic farm where city kids could come and experience farm life, or maybe a home for mentally challenged...stuff like that. It could work, it would depend on, God's will, your motivation, and logistics I guess.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You can do both. Get in touch with the Vocationists.

No thought of who they may offend with their words, but I'm not surprised. Perhaps I should tell you not what I do on full moons, but what I once did.     Once, a long time ago, before anyone here was born and even before the birth of the world's most famed son of god: Jesus, I was stood in a field. I stood beneath the full moon and I held my love tightly after she had come to me. She didn't think I would come home that night because my life was in danger and so were the lives of the rest of the pack I ran with. I had killed that night, I had been shot in the back with arrows and pulled them out, only to turn on my attacker and murder him. I did not feel right about what I was doing, but I did it for survival. I do not remember why him and the other humans wished to kill us, but they tried, and they failed.     And so, here I am in this life...in the present. I know now that my mate is safe and that I will find ehr again in this life. But, I also know that I still do not understand human ways. I know that anyone reading this has probaably already looked away and thought me crazed or a liar. And, if that is the way they feel, then fine. Everyone has the right to their own opinion, but I just wish they would at least consider something like this. I am not crazed and I am not a liar. I speak the truth, and I know that very few of all humans will understand me. The rest, however, will continue to laugh at me and look to me as if I am some sort of murderer, when I am not. But, I don't care anymore what humans think. I have my family and that is all I need now.    Does that answer your question?

Here is a list of educational sites that can help you learn about the issue  http://www.LynnConway.com  http://www.TSRoadmap.com  http://transsexual.org/index.html  http://www.transgendercare.com/  http://www.marcibowers.com/|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	you just need to talk to someone. a therapist, a perent or teacher. a guidance counselor, a friend. or maybe one of your contacts on Y!A. if you want to talk, email me. but talk to someone.  the only thing i can say with certainty is that your confused...|`|AA12006309	Alright, first let me help put things into perspective for you.  Your gender identity and sexual orientation are two separate things.  For the sake of this discussion, we're not going to cover sexual orientation for the moment, and focus just on gender identity.    In your situation, you've had these feelings for quite a long time!  It might be best to find a gender therapist - someone who has experience dealing with gender issues - to help you sort out exactly what you're feeling.  This would be the first step in transitioning, if you decide to go that route.    Only you can decide what transition means to you. Some people go for full SRS, some only partial.  I'm not having any surgery personally, but my MtF friend is going to be taking hormones, and not having full SRS.  There are many variations to transition.  You can just take hormones and live as a woman, but not have surgery.  You can have partial surgery (implants, feminization) but not full genital surgery.  Some FtMs have topsurgery, but never have bottom surgery.  The only person who can determine the level of transition you should undertake is you.    Take some time for some soul searching to determine exactly which path you'd like to follow, whether as a transsexual, transgender, crossdresser, or anywhere else on the gender spectrum you feel that you belong.  I'll post some links below that should prove a bit informative.  Good luck.|`|uG3lPB9xaa	sounds a lot like myself ^^    i know thats the right thing for me to do... took me a lot of time to figure that out though... but then again i didnt have the kind of knowledge about the possibilities there are at your age... i wish i did... i really thought i could just live my life as a straight guy but last year i eventually "gave up" because i know that's not what i want, or who i am ...     you do sound like you are transsexual but if you're not really sure thats when a therapist could help... you'll have to go see one anyways if you are... about paying it, if your parents dont help you there (which would mean you got to have told them about it... ) how about a part time job? ... well in some countries health insurance pays for it but i dont know which one's and how much...    if you want srs is really your choice, its not something others can decide for you because (and you seem to be fully aware of that) its a very big decision so it shouldn't be taken lightly... i've read that many transgender people never have srs (although for me thats a very important part of becoming a woman... but well thats just my very personal decision and its not like you cant live as a woman if you don't do it)     if you havent been there already you should go to www.lynnconway.com to find pretty much all the information you'd need ...
oY4vwdjVaa	Yes...I've had that conversation in person with a few people.

MP: Yes.|`|lxYWZc9caa	I'm not LGBT, but I've been lectured on this, and its horrible. I mean, you can have a religion and keep your opinions to yourself, really. Everytime I get that lecture, I just wanna hit that person square in the face. Ugh, its horrbile. I love the way you handled yourself. Good for you.|`|uky2nsh8aa	very  lmao  u just gotta ingore it  cause i have a gf who says i'm cute! *claps and climbs on daoie's head* i feel so tall! yay! *bounces up and down*|`|ErN3pbTeaa	I've met and talked to worse...But that's just stupidity like that person above me said.|`|TLOgBy3caa	Hahaha.

I don't got nothing much else to do. Hopefully I can be of help.|`|vf5hl9FSaa	First off I'm really sorry that your life is going that way right now.  Just try to relax I'm assuming that in a few years you will be off on your own doing whatever you want with your life so just hang in there.     Don't feel spoiled who is to say that your problems are any less serious than anyone else's anywhere.  I know that something like that has to cause alot of stress and negative feelings.  So don't feel spoiled or that you are just complaining.    If you ever need to talk to me about anything feel free to message me.  : ]|`|Y0O6971laa	My mom has high blood sugar and does the same exact thing (different subject b/c im straight) and it sucks.  I know how it feels to want to run away, but I deal mostly by writing in my journal, reading poetry like Edgar Allen Poe, or thinking.  I guess i've just learned that pain always goes away and that no matter what, I'm loved.    I really don't mean to get religious, but I'm going through confirmation and my minister always tells us we're unconditionally loved.  Even if you aren't religious at all, it's important to know.  I know exactly how hard it is for parents to tell you you're an awful person or that they hate you (it's not uncommon for me).  It hurts.  Badly.      I guess what I'm trying to say is that no matter what, things always get better if you believe it will.  Through all of the S H ! T my parents have put me through, I've learned to forgive people almost immediately.  I know it's hard, but chances are you'll come out better and stronger in the end.|`|l8c2kTlvaa	I feel like that as well, although my mother disguises her rude comments so I can't say shes being a b!tch when she actually is.  You could talk with them about it, and tell them how much it hurts for them to say things like that - although I know it would be hard, and I would never be able to talk with my mother about such things but if you feel like you can, then I suggest telling them.  Or talking with your friends, hanging out with them and just forgetting about your parents for a while can help. I spend as much of my time as I can with my friends to get away from my mother! And it helps, enjoy your time with friends and then try to get on with your parents as much as possibe. And don't feel bad or like a spoilt brat for ranting, I do all the time and your situation sounds a lot worse than mine. email me, if I'm not at school, i'm on the internet :)|`|Zd6Y98Pxaa	It sounds like your parents are really stressed out.  It can be hard being a teenager.  I know. I used to be one.  My mom was so stressed our doctor gave her Valium.  But I'm just some 'pseudo' on Y!A. What kind of advice   can I give you?    Well, this guy says it better than I could:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQVNgQi3w...  and there's some more info here:  http://www.youtube.com/user/18004483000      There's more to life than having material things,  and those 'worse off' kids may have a better   emotional environment.  I would never say you're  pathetic, but I do notice some sadness in some  of the things you write.  Maybe you can get some  good advice if you call the number in the video.  It doesn't cost anything and could lead to good ideas.    Lie down and watch some clouds for a while.  Try to focus on peace.  Don't let something your mom  says stress you out.  Tell her how it hurts you  instead   of snapping back.  There's a lot of time to make your  life turn out good.  Running away is dangerous -- but  it's a natural reaction.  It's better to face your problems  and try to find solutions calmly.  Good luck.  We're pulling for you.    .  P.S.:  I saw the video on TV while I was reading your  question.  Co-incidence?|`|J1XwqvLGaa	Aww, I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such things. I think if you're "so called" father is beating you, I think you should seek some help. It's never a pretty sight to see someone get abused by their own parents/guardians. Stay strong, seek help if you need. We're here if you ever need to talk love.
wnSvjwWuaa	I totally understand where you're coming from. I've always thought that vegetarians (most, not all) seem to be operating out of this moralistic, holier, I'm-better-than-you pedestal which, from my observation, seems unwarranted most of the time.    Just about the only thing I will concede is that the poop of vegetarians does not have a foul odor, as opposed to meat eaters. And that's not exactly an "honor" I'd go around town bragging, being a dubious one at best.    The "Veggie Love" ad is another example of this thinking: we don't eat meant, therefore, we have better sex. Don't we here (in LGBT) get perennially irked when some "Christian" comes on board and starts telling us that we won't be going to heaven, and that THEY know the way to salvation, blah blah blah...it's exactly the same thing with this ad: what it's really saying is, "Follow us to better sex, we know the way."    I love meat, period.|`|4pgzNYcEaa	I'm a vegetarian and this is the first time I hear about the PETA saying this. If it is true, I am slightly offended and I consider this a form of discrimination. Food intake should not affect what goes on behind closed doors.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	WTF did I just watch. Were they masturbating with the veggies or cooking themselves in a stew? I'm quite confuzzled. Either way, what a stupid and irrelevant commercial. I know they say that sex sells but I don't even know what they were trying to sell.|`|ox4tmOpJaa	I just consider the source.|`|nXBPXVnkaa	I liken PETA to young, teenage boys. While they behave most of the time, they can be quite...capricious.     Bah, what do they know about sex anyway?|`|evnLjcnxaa	Yes I am! This is totally ridiculous and just more proof that the "Peta People" are ignorant and have no scientifical evidence of this. They are just trying to get attention..in a really bad way. I've seen clips of that commercial and it stops short of porn.....I prefer a d*ck over a cucumber any day!! LOL.|`|DVw7H5fIaa	That commercial is creepy btw      PETA likes to pretend they know things. I'm not mad (I eat meat).   But PETA needs to realise that animals, like us (we're animals), have been eating other animals SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME. They're not going to change that, it's integral to our diet. You body does actually differenientate between plant protein (beans) and animal protein (meat, milk, eggs) and it needs both.      Me and my boyfriend both eat meat, and yeah. They're wrong lol|`|vGbTKA2Haa	LOL that's funny  the video is sexy but um I beg to differ! lol    |`|uky2nsh8aa	lmfao  well, ejaculation's suppose to taste better if ur one. *shrugs*|`|yzgS5KiQaa	They probably mean that people who eat healthier in general have better sex. You can be a unhealthy vegetarian, you can eat cookies an chips an be a vegetarian. An you can also be a healthy meat eater. But I think the majority of vegetarians are healthy. Also good health is only one aspect of good sex. So much more of it involves communication, and an open mind, I'd say the good 90% part.   But you have to understand that PETA is a corporation with an agenda. And what ad doesn't try to say that you will be sexier, or get more attention or be rich an skinny if you use their product (no matter What, it is might I add LOL) I think what is so upsetting about that commercial is there is a grain of truth to it. Just a grain.|`|2uUctFHEaa	i think the guy's in this section that are "meat eaters" have the best sex if you catch my drift.|`|OsxQNDHzaa	Personally, I love a good meat eater!!  LOL  :@)|`|AyEkA6Flaa	One wonders how they found this out! =P    Veggie whores?  Polyamorous vegans?  Prostitutes for peas?|`|BmYy9vuuaa	Im vegetarian.......and im PRETTY sure my gf thinks im okay in bed :)    Though, i dont REALLY see the science behind the ad.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	I'm generally mad at PETA for making animal rights activists look like morons. I love animals but every time I hear about PETA i want want to go eat a baby seal steak while wearing a mink coat just to piss them off.|`|JeHTh4Knaa	Yeah right.  Maybe better sex with vegetables.  lmao.
fULZei1haa	fear, ignorance, intolerance...sad but true, many older folks just can't accept gay people. Prejudice is hard to combat, but just make sure that you don't keep that thought process going...and don't pass it on to your kids either!|`|u04pBBq3aa	People are all which way my friends family likes me but I have no idea what they are going to say when they find out i am a lesbian.|`|6KGGAtNtaa	Because its wrong|`|oSsVEXMxaa	You won't know until you ask them. The most common reasons are religious upbringing or plain ignorance. You have to discuss it with them and make them think critically about their beliefs - if you don't challenge it, they won't change.|`|IyjLf3CRaa	Because they do, it's their opinion and if you don't like it it's too damn bad for you.|`|J0h1TKkxaa	im not sure  you may want to ask them  and then change thier minds  theres no room for hating|`|AA12006309	Why not try opening a dialogue with them about it?  Ask them why they feel that way, and remind them that they probably have gay friends and acquaintances without realizing it.  Gay people aren't going anywhere.  They should probably just get used to it.

She found a part playing a spoiled, rich, looks-obsessed skank who aspires to be a famous singer. And she carried it off absolutely perfectly!    Care to see what I'm talking about? Go buy a copy of Repo! The Genetic Opera. The movie is excellent and Paris Hilton is downright not-so-bad.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	It's too easy to call her a bimbo.

Then with her ill-educated mind and practically unlimited budget, she could be dangerous.|`|Nu6HaIfgaa	I don't know her personally, so I can only judge her superficially. That said, I think she's too skinny.|`|GOaDQuhlaa	She is a beautiful spoiled brat.... who needs to grow up|`|znt2s3sMaa	She glorifies herself, rather than God.   I hope that someday she will turn to God and use some of the billions of dollars to help others.|`|0H8prIJCaa	She's the perfect business women. She made 7 million dollars last year (yes, that's right!! $7,000,000) from technically doing no actual "work" at all. She has the looks, personality and wealthy stigma to make money off herself so lets face it she's fantastic! Who wouldn't want to make money off their own popularity - women envy her and men want to bang her - she's the queen of Generation 'Y' women everywhere.    I suppose people hate her for being in a position of incredible fortune, from being born into money she had an amazing advantage over millions of middle/lower class people and seems to be giving nothing in return.    People used to hate Bill Gates before he gave 90% of his profit to African Aid charities. Paris should show a little compassion instead of flaunting her expensive jewelery and clothes before the world.    All in all, she's only human and has faults of her own but it's not like she chose to be good looking and have money -she is lucky.|`|6k2lmVChaa	Paris who?|`|tpxWSau5aa	potrebbe essere pi simpatica se si darebbe meno arie|`|H7OyAEpXaa	i think wich ishe is a very stupid woman!

Southeast Asians like Cambodians, Vietnamese, Thai, Malaysians, Laos, etc are very dark-skinned. But Indonesians are the darkest. They actually have brown or very dark skin.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Japanese are not born dark skinned.  They are fair. They get dark when they tan.

There are "Ganguro Girls", which are a trend in Japanese Culture, where Japanese Women make their skin brownish.

I know there are dark skinned Koreans and some Southern Chinese People have slightly darker complexions|`|tlUihEOvaa	There are dark skinned full Asians as there are light skin full Asians.

GrKiEDb1aa	I was probably 4 or 5 and I remember the little ditty: EENY MEENY MINEY MOE, CATCH A ....BY THE TOE. I thought N was like an elf or something.  Seriously. I think I learned it from other kids.  I DO remember meeting my first black man.  We were on a Greyhound bus.  I was restless and a black soldier was sitting across the isle.  He offered my mother to have him hold me and entertain me for a while.  I remember clearly he gave me a Hershey's bar.  When he unwrapped it, I looked at it and looked at him and said, "You're the same color as my candy bar!"  My mother chided me and he said, "That's alright, I've been called worse."  Years later I asked my mother if that really happened and she was surprised that I remembered the incident.  She said we were going to Detroit and I was getting ready to go into kindergarten.  That would have been about 1951.  The things we remember!|`|CEChcfKwaa	I was 8 and my white cousin got mad at me for something and called me the N word. I bloodied his nose and then my aunt whupped him with the belt when I told her why I did it. Lol..he never said it again.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	As far as I remember, I first heard it in 1st grade. From kids in school.     I grew up in a city with many different ethnicities and we all clowned on each other based on our heritage.  Blacks, Latinos, Filipinos, Somoans, Asians, Whites  It was all love though.  We were all friends, just clowning.  If anything, it was the whites who got hated on.    I first learned about true racism from the police, at age 12 and up.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	This girl called me a ******, better believe I beat her ***.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Never heard it (in person) from someone outside my race but people in my race it disgusted me I wish they could shut up|`|tlUihEOvaa	It was in middle school where stupid kids thought it was cool to use the n-word. They say things like "wassup my n-word" and most of them aren't even Black.     I didn't know what it meant till later on.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	Someone on yahoo answers sent me an email a few months ago calling me the N-word and a few other insults.|`|Uy58ixnvaa	O gosh, I can barely remember. I guess I was like 5-6 when I heard the n-word in a song. Yeah, it was a rap song.|`|ngbzNiPDaa	The first time I heard one was at my elementary school (5th grade) and someone used the word Ch*nk, at that time I was slow and I had no clue what that meant. I realized it 2 months after it, and it hurt as soon as I found out. It stuck with me because someone was calling me something I didn't even know about.

I pray for all the lost souls that they will be saved before that time comes, so that they can go to Heaven and be with our Lord Almighty and not spend eternity in Hell.|`|1xMTNTgkaa	I think we should act like the best people we can for judgment can come day or night at any time. Only God knows the date and time as said in the Bible. 2012 would be a date we know therefor God has nothing to do with it.|`|6jAVElX7aa	we should be prepared each day, as Jesus said :That no one would know the hour or the day only His Father in Heaven."  He could come tomorrow or even this day.  And just be thankful, that God loves us enough to send Christ into the world, to redeem us and set us free from sin. It is by grace we are saved. It is a gift from God.|`|ul1P1qAQaa	You can't force people to treat one another better. That has never worked. The best way to achieve that is to let people be as they are. If nobody felt threatened, and if nobody felt they had some force that kept them from achieving what they wanted... what reason would they have to  hurt others. A lot of anger and the things we do because of it comes from what frustrates and hurts us. The best thing we could all do is try and understand why people do what they do rather than try and mold them in the form we think they should be. The more I learn the less I feel frustrated with others, because I realize they aren't as bad as I thought. If we all helped ourselves instead of worrying about what others are doing, we'd probably be in a much better place.|`|WfR6AqHiaa	pff 2012. thats based on some stupid mayan calender stopping. i was so shocked when i found out when i actually learned why people were afraid of 2012|`|71c6c3d26be7dbca2bd5e204e344e5f6aa	For many, judgement day will come before 2012.

No. So forget about 2012....you never know which heart beat will be your last. Figure it out now. The day where you face eternity may be closer than you think.    As for the second part of your question, good luck getting people to treat each other with decency....people in the word just aren't very nice as a whole.    Edit - oh, and here. "No one knows when that day or hour will come. Even the angels in heaven and the Son don't know. Only the Father knows." Matthew 24:36    And - 1 Thessalonians 5:2-4 "for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night."    We don't know. Always be prepared.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	We should be prepared for any eventuality.

Jesus said no one knows the day and hour, not even the angels.   It is not even a correct interpretation of the mayan calendar, yet doomsday prophecy makes people money.    But, please understand that redemption is not something to be strived for, it is the FREE gift of God through His grace, not by our works, lest anyone can boast.  Free to anyone who will call upon His name and believe.|`|KueK03T5aa	No one knows the time or the day or the year when Jesus will return...not even Jesus Himself. Only God knows!

Jesus said that broad is the path that leads to destruction and narrow is the gate that leads to heaven, few will enter it. Some of what you said I don't even understand like "I need to offer to assume the penance for those who strive for redemption". We are not redeemed by penance. The only way to be redeemed is through belief in Jesus as the provider of our salvation through His sacrifice for our sins on the cross. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.  I suggest reading the Bible more, like Luke.|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	2012 is NOT judgement day!  FIRST OFF, 2012 is a YEAR, not a day!  Secondly, this rumor comes from the alleged fact that the Mayan calendar ends in 2012.  The Bible on the other hand ASSURES US that no man knows the day or the hour of the end.      Relax.  Whenever the end comes, the same God who is in control will be in control.  It's okay.|`|3p3otDlXaa	Yes.  At times I've heard that Jesus isn't coming back until we don't care about loving anyone anymore.  "Way off my charts!!"|`|deqX4oQQaa	Only God know when Judgement day is, PERIOD!

The only way we will be wiped out if crazy idiots that think about this stuff just keep on thinking about it and doing nothing!|`|77Nn0gWRaa	they say the day is on December 21, the darkest day of the year, makes sense    i'm sure if you didn't violently assult anyone in the last few days, you'll be ok because even if we do do those "sin-ish" things, they're considered ok because we're not exactly evil.    besides, the mayan calender marks it not for Judgement day, but for this great event. by "great" they don't know if it's the apocolypse or the day the cure for cancere is found. so there's the possibility that something good's going to happen rather than bad.    cheers|`|5gkV0phfaa	I dont think 2012 will be judgment day or the end of the world..

Yeah, of course you have to. That's horrible. Who exactly did you promise not to tell, seriously? That's probably one of the most horrible things a kid could through.  But, though, I believe you're not serious because of your grammar and the category you are in.  10/10 for the sensitive subject.  You have your friend's well being in your hands. You have the power to either stop or not, since she obviously is not gonna tell anyone. You apparently care more about your friendship than her well being.|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	screw your promise! tell someone now!|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Yes don't sit by and watch it.

EDIT:She is being molested,it will ruin her mentally nd emotionally if you do not tell.He should not be able to get away with this.It is a sick crime,that is why it is ILLEGAL.I do NOT care if it is her dad,it IS illegal and wrong and he should be locked up.Many people who are molested have problems later on in life,Please tell.Not telling will do more harm than good|`|nvDNAqWKaa	you cant seriously be asking that. YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR PARENTS THE POLICE A TEACHER TELL AN ADULT whats more important a stupid promise or your friends life?|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	There are times in a friend ship that snitching is the only option.  As a friend you love her and the only thing you can do is help her.  I would never want my friend or anyone to be getting hurt or molested.  Help her please tell the cops or your parents.  Friendship comes with a promise to love, protect and cherish that person.   Take the first step to breaking this. She will thsnk you later i promise.|`|AA12006309	This is difficult.  Even if you tell, there's the possibility if confronted your friend will lie to protect her father.  In the end, she needs to realize what's happening is wrong and needs to tell a trusted adult - preferably one outside her family - like a teacher or guidance counselor.    She has to realize the pain won't end until she speaks up, and even after she moves out, even after she's away from him, the experience is going to haunt her until she is honest about what's happening to her.  This could mean the rest of her life.    She needs to tell someone what is happening, and she needs therapy to help work past the trauma.  If you can, get her to read these posts here, maybe then she'll understand better what she needs to do. Good luck.|`|76sHrI26aa	Molested?|`|jLLvmWJHaa	Yes...    What he is doing is ABSOLUTELY WRONG. And I have no idea why she would want it to endure like that.     I mean, of course it would be a huge family mess, but what's wrong must be stopped at once.     I hope everything works out and that man gets what he DESERVES.|`|987923b8a7fffddd6d84106ce71d68a3aa	Please tell someone. Maybe your folks could help. But you need to tell someone now.|`|YbPHUdKwaa	Try talking to her about her herself telling someone first.  Tell her that you know it can hurt her and her family, but that she can't just keep letting it happen. She needs to tell someone. It doesn't have to be the police, but at least a teacher, or an ADULT that she can trust.    Trauma from Molestation is life long if it doesn't get stopped.  If she thinks it makes her feel horrible now, letting it happen, think of how she will feel years from now. I've been around, and even really good friends with people that have been molested when they were younger. It's ALWAYS there taunting you. Most of them didn't say anything either, but years down the road wished they had.    If she doesn't want to tell anyone. Then I suggest you tell someone.  I know it will be hard betraying a promise that you made to a friend, but YOU could even start getting depressed and have mental stress from even something like knowing it's going on and not doing anything about it.  And even though she might be mad at you now, later on she'll thank you for telling someone, and helping her. Because it will help it stop.    Good luck Hun, on whatever decision you make.
4WqvTAfmaa	You mention that you want to grow your gifts. That is precisely the RIGHT kind of spell to be doing. Dont know if that particular one is good, but make sure you understand what the cards mean that you use.     Gifts are sometimes a two-edged sword. They are a gift, but they can be hard to handle. Another answer mentions shielding. Amen to that! If you do not know how, get the book PSYCHIC SELF DEFENSE AND WELL BEING, Denning & Phillips, Llewellyn Publications, you will have to get a used copy.     Alternatively, you can get MAG 114 PERSONAL RITUALS, which I wrote. CoronaLuci.com for availability. It has shielding and other work to start development of inner ability.     Do meditation too. Any kind will do. It develops discipline, familiarity with non-normal awareness, and focus. These skills will help no matter what kind of gifts you have.     Best wishes for your spell. If you are concerned about details, feel free to email me. I am happy to help where I can.     Denning & Phillips also have a book on Tarot magic, but I cannot recall the name, It is good too.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	Tarot is a tricky thing. It has worked for me, but you need to interpret it correctly.Make sure you are  careful in your interpretations!|`|AA10455120	It's hard to say specifically, since you don't give details. but in general,    1, whatever you believe will work, will, because magick is powered by belief.    2, tarot cards should be good because they are very archetypal, and also carry a lot of energy because of people's belief.    3, any spell you make Yourself (as opposed to one you get form a book) will work best.    make sure you learn how to ground, center and shield before you actually do any spellwork, they're a little like the arcane version of safety goggles..    don't do a love spell directed a t a specific person (for example making brad pitt fall in love with you), because it's psychic rape and will wear off anyway.    Remember Karma; whatever you do comes back to you.    feel free to email me if you need help, and blessed be :)|`|dFBccLExaa	Well, magick, tarot, and spells are all as evil as you make them to be. Don't listen to people who tell you you're going to go to hell for doing spell work. I've used tarot cards to erect barriers, and represent people, I don't see why you wouldn't be able to use them for other things.

8Pro95Izaa	People are going to be more relieved than dissapointed. I can believe that there are those who hope for the end but you have to also be aware that not everyone wants the end of the world to come.     So in my answer I ask you, is it wrong for people to consider the possibility and prepare for it? As a witch I hope, pray and help create the best out of any experience, comming situation or anythign that comes my way but as a parent I cannot help but be over cautious and over prepare sometimes. I cannot help  but worry at times with all the "what ifs".     So on your question" how does this make you fee?" I say:     This does not make me feel much of anything but sadness that something so huge in a some people's lives is being used to put them down. That people cannot seem to just let other's keep going, that instead of helping them understand in a gentle fashion you try and make them feel like their beliefs are less than yours. Sure they may be, or seem irrelavent but if you haven't noticed it is not up to any of us to choose what everyone else worries about. But we can choose how we're going to help relieve them of their stress. I am not sure whether you care about people in general, but if you do then your intentions are to educate. As someone who works with people (offline and online) this sort of approach does not always work. It has a low success rate and would be better if you would provide information that says otherwise to the current beleif and link people to this information.     This is how I feel about this question and the subject.     I would agree more with you on it being the end of an age and NOT the end of the world, but I will not stop anyone from preparing for it. I do the same with every other happening in my life. To be even completely honest, im actually working on saving some food and other needs because the way things are going I fear that even though the world doesn't really end, it might feel as if it has with the way our current economy is going :(    Blessed be and great question,   Shadow Storm|`|mKIA6V4Saa	I'm gonna dance a jig.|`|g4cYFVrmaa	I think there will be a few people who are very disappointed|`|ls9gft0vaa	Who says we will make it to see 2012?|`|2ce98f89b5fb6689e09d3b661af638c0aa	I have been duped by the history channel again and again!

mFf8CqAraa	Stand up for yourself and tell her exactly what you said here. Maybe not so much in words, but in your actions. They say, "If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing." I'd be so livid by her telling me to clean up her dirty dishes that my silence and lack of "obeying orders" would pretty well communicate my intent.    Be overly nice and polite when you tell her, "I'm sorry, that's not in my job description." Kill her with kindness but stay firm. If that fails and you're still finding that she's asking you to do menial tasks, go over her head. You were hired by the same people that hired her and I'm sure they'd be thrilled to find out they're paying you to do her laundry.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	Tell her to stop telling you what to do and to only speak to you when it pertains to the academics of the students. Tell her that as far as cleaning up that you expect her to do her share. She thinks she can order you around because she is the teacher and you are the aide. Don't let her treat you that way. Sometimes it doesn't pay to be polite. I think you just have to speak up and be firm about it. People only do to you what you let them do.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	I would start by telling her you wish to share the burden of clean up or a better alternative go back to school and get your master's and then you will have your own servant - win-win.
AA11785185	No. I don't see a problem with it. I have often, in the past, had good female friends who I had claimed were my "girlfriend" to various individuals I didn't want knowing or asking about my sexuality. And they would join in by confirming this. In many cases, those female friends were lesbians and so it worked well for them too. It kept people from asking to many questions when I was younger.     Of course, I don't do that anymore since I haven't had a reason to lie about myself to anyone for any reason and my own self respect dictates that I will not hide who I am or shield who I am behind falsehoods just to make others feel comfortable. I also always find it amusing when gay people use terms like "acting straight" when describing themselves and the characteristic they value. Because, in reality, they are basically saying that they value "acting" over being real. Straight acting is just that- an act.     Now, being masculine, on the other hand, is totally different. I love masculine men! I myself am a pretty masculine man. But I also can separate between masculinity and acting straight.|`|yAX8pDdiaa	Not at all It's actually rather "hot" I act straight and I sometimes need to pretend I'm straight.|`|WFYtrtRmaa	if hes happy.  if your happy.    that should be all that matters. but no the LGBT community wouldnt like this. its basically saying he doesnt fully accept his sexuality. and fear of judgement. hopefully society will learn more about homosexuals or humanity for that matter, and become less ignorant. and spread the love =]|`|61c100d0b63aa5406ca62b129bb3c428aa	Not at all  When my bf and i are out we often pretend we are straight, but we are coming to that point in life (even though we are only young) that life is to short to hide away from the world, so we are beginning to express our love in front of some people.  I guess for others its just how they feel (how comfortable) they feel in front of others. For some it takes time, for others it comes naturally.|`|MuALb7lxaa	I think it's because gay people think that people look down on them because they don't like the opposite sex. I think gay people should be proud.|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	i do this. i honestly have no real reason behind it. i think i first started back in highschool when i was struggling with my sexuality. and i was never able to shake it off.|`|GSXHtzSHaa	If they are effeminate they'll look ridiculous. And nope, I don't mind if they ask me.|`|diCASlUXaa	I dunno.    I guess they can act however they want.|`|Dkylapi6aa	I don't mind. What I do mind is "exgays" trying to pretend that you can really change your sexual orientation. Oh and I have a problem with straight men acting gay because that can be misleading to real gay people
dCewrtXaaa	Because a lot of the foreign language teachers are older, and French was the main international language way back when they were in school. It was considered a cultural plus. And now the schools pretty much have those teachers with them until they reach retirement age. Things will change, but very gradually.    It would make sense to teach Chinese, Russian, and Arabic, but we have enough trouble getting US students to study second languages at all. Having to deal with a different alphabet or system of writing might scare them off. American teenagers are often quite xenophobic.|`|4Vmlf902aa	I'm guessing cause French and Spanish are some of the most spoken languages in the country. Also if you look at it economically and socially you've got millions of people from around the world speaking this language. So it only makes since to teach a language that is spoken worldwide. They could teach Japanese but that wouldn't be useful in most of Europe or South America, like French and Spanish would. Also French is spoken in parts of Africa and I think Vietnam. Learning one of these languages could increase you chances of getting a job in Europe, S.A., etc.|`|evEJxv06aa	maybe it is  required  to take it or some kids want to take it right.|`|AA10948829	They do teach other languages such as German, Latin, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Italian...|`|jiwTWNNtaa	My mother took Latin. Why the hell did they teach Latin?

It has an estimated population of 7.75 million (Canada including Quebec: 33.54 million)   USA has 305.72 million so with that population, it'd be as if QC has 70,641,920 people and the vast majority speak french as their predominate language including myself when I lived there.|`|1fGBLJvVaa	dude i ask that too      but i think that there is lot or bussiness in france      and u seem smart if u know it|`|myj319upaa	Because spanish(duh) but they teach french because it sounds really pretty, or somthing.|`|AA11598520	First, Spanish is the most spoken language in the world except for Cantonese which is spoken mostly in China. That's one reason. French used to be the international language.    Now, probably it has more to do with finding people who speak these other languages and can teach them adequately. Language teachers, even those who speak only Spanish or French are not easy to find.    OK, this is a little frightening. I hate to mention it to all these high school kids, but Canada speaks ENGLISH. There is a very small province that speaks French but most of those people also speak fluent English. It's got nothing to do with Canada. (Maybe we should just stick to the basics in our schools.)|`|l2qtG4yfaa	I wondered that too, my school only teaches French or Spanish. My old school taught German, Latin, French, and Spanish.    I wish they added different Asian languages like Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese.    The only problem is, is that there aren't enough resources for those languages in the U.S. (teachers, books since they would have to buy all new stuff)    And that the two countries that border us have French and Spanish as important languages. It all comes down to money and location.|`|FmEsMOKVaa	well ...what are the 3 languages in the world that is most spoken?    How many countries speak french? How many countries speak Spanish?    English is considered the business language.    How many people would speak ..lets say greek or any african language?    When you go to college...there are other languages you can pay to learn. But the main 3 that are spokenin the world other then chinese...is those 3.    And chinese is actually 2 diferent languages called mandarin and cantonese...and they are only spoken in China...and not spread out across the world like french and spanish.     French is spoken in many countries....not just France. Also...I'm sure you already know that Spanish is also known to many countries.|`|HI0oQriqaa	if you check here on y/a you will see that they don't teach english very well . not only grammar but spelling. it seems to me that we should be fluent in  our native language before trying to learn a foreign one.|`|4d8923629944072027bbc12052c6a2e3aa	Any school worth its salt should teach German and Italian as well.|`|ls9gft0vaa	Canada (French) and Mexico(Spanish) By the way some schools still teach classic Latin ( you know like ancient Romans)|`|tMK190xaaa	they teach lots of different languages, i took latin. my bf had german in high school. it just depends, it's not only french, but you're right about the spanish|`|Ai8H5N8paa	cuz it makes more since, what if we wanna communicate people in canada. dont you think itd be wierd if they taught german or like african with clicks of the mouth, those too make the most sense|`|AA11258464	Why not?

In Australia, it's either Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish or German.|`|9c34c7a7ad663d73b2aa40d6cd0868d7aa	because we have canada above us.     spanish is a must for some areas, and schools usually must offer a language so that their students go to college...but they usually can't afford extra teachers, so language classes get cut until the bare minimum is required.|`|hd442Ha5aa	French, spanish, german and english [obviously] are the major languages spoken across the world. Go to Central and South America you'll hear Spanish. Go to Europe, you'll hear all four. India is English. Canada is english and french. That is why|`|CJ4mhsFYaa	Well, many jobs have to deal with spanish or French branches so if you were to get transfered there you would need to know what the F*ck they're saying.|`|ZTVmUb4Laa	I think it's because in North America the three most common languages are English (U.S. and Canada), Spanish (Mexico and U.S.) , and French (Canada and to a certain extent Mexico).    [edit]  Not to mention the fact that German is also a common language in U.S. schools. Japanese and Chinese are also becoming more common, especially in private schools.|`|pOLBKKNpaa	because Spanish and French are the two most major languages of Europe, other than English|`|pewENLaJaa	Because there are many people in America that do speak French (and many others), and our neighbors up north have French as an official language.

French is spoken in the US in parts of Maine, as well as in Quebec.     As for usefulness in everyday living for most Americans, spanish is certainly more useful, but I believe the decision to create French & Spanish departments in most places was made prior to the more recent wave of immigrants from Latin American countries.     BTW> in some cities they do teach other languages (German, Japanese, etc)|`|3eZr6oZcaa	idk i would think spanish because alot of immigrants from mexico....then maybe chinese, cuz theres so many people in china.....maybe german because thats the closest to english.......maybe japanese because alot of technology and buissness comes thru there....but french?....i dont get that|`|0PKDVWAqaa	Until the late 1800"s, French was the official language used by diplomats in the "modern" world.      Actually it is still today the official language during all Olympics games - i.e last summer in Beijing, all announcements in the stadiums were being made in both Chinese & French.|`|zLXmOXkBaa	Not sure why. German is also another one they teach here. I think it more depends on the region of the country, because of ancestral heritage.     For example, in Lousianna they push French in the schools because so many people there have French heritage in their backgrounds. In Wisconsin, they heavily push German because the majority of the population there are German decendants.
RcB2FNWRaa	Whether or not an accent can be copied depends more on the skill of the speaker than the accent itself - in other words, all accents, theoretically, can be copied.  Therefore, someone who is good at copying accents may sound like a native, whereas someone not so good will be easily found out as a fraud.|`|R0NfdgzLaa	of course it can.  start by replacing Es with Is... "ten beds" becomes "tin bids"  eggs = iggs  the rest will come.    don't forget to throw in a "bro", "cuz" or "cuzzy bro"
AA10948829	Only "I am bored with my job."  "I am bored of my job" is unnatural.    "I am tired of my boyfriend" and "I am tired from my work" are both correct but not "I am tired with my boyfriend."    I think, grammatically, they are all fine but one sounds natural and one sounds unnatural.
PVYBLGFuaa	Homophobes say "Nurtue"  Common Sence says "Nature"    Us homosexuals don't CHOOSE to be hated by 2/3 of the world!!!|`|dkoGI9nfaa	I have a cousin who is gay. He did not want to be gay.  He simply could not help himself.  If I see how many people battle with it and how through the centuries it was an issue for many people I simply cannot believe it is through choice.  If it was nurture they it would suggest learnt behaviour and that can be unlearnt.  I think it is the prejudice and bias of society even today that makes us ask the question.  They have done many studies to determine whether homosexuality is nature or nurture and not one of them came up with a conclusive answer.  If you are just slightly older you might remember a time when it was illegal to have sex with the same sex.  Why would anyone choose trouble?  I am sorry I just cannot accept that it is nurture.  100% convinced it is nature.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Like everything in else in life,it's more complex than just that,i think it's inside them from birth but they have to chose to except it and be the person they are meant to be.|`|a432b51e0a46f5957270f47cd8423553aa	dont be a   d i c k,   homosexuality/bisexuality is not a condition. I suggest you reword your question buddy      Then only problem that exist is people who hate/loath gay/bi/lesbians just because they are what they are. Seriously, think about it. Why would someone want to be gay or whatever if the whole word wasn't going to accept them and they were gonna be made fun of for the rest of their life.        yep, everyone deserves an opinion.

6y29MTyyaa	I think if I had problems with one, I'd have problems with the other.  Good thing I don't.    I size up people by their influence -- what they take, what they give, what they create, what they destroy.  A lesbian who makes a woman very happy in a relationship is A-OK.  A straight person who cheats and leaves a trail of shattered hearts behind only gets contempt.  A straight philanthropist gets my admiration.  A gay serial killer, to put it mildly, will not.  Long story short, sexual orientation is a non-factor.  They're not lesbians who do this or that; it's the other way around. They're people -- individuals -- who happen to be lesbian.    Of course, as a straight guy I do get turned on by lesbian pr0n and such.  But fantasy is fantasy.  I also own a copy of "Grand Theft Auto:  Vice City" but I'm not about to become a violent drug dealer, either.  I treat the lesbians I know in real life with respect, and they're happy to reward me with friendship.

It has always seemed to me that many arranged marriages work far better than marriages which are left entirely to chance, meeting the right person and falling in love forever and ever.

de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Learn this: It is not possible to have an intelligent debate with someone who does not possess one degree of intelligence, e.g., you guy you mention. His words "immature" and "not intelligent" apply to him alone. You can always say something like "I would engage you in a battle of wits, but I make it a rule never to fight an unarmed opponent." He did not want to "debate" (actually a misnomer here, because he had no viable comeback because you were right) because he couldn't debate. Any time anyone calls someone who makes a thoughtful comment a "retard" they are describing themselves...|`|1JSblCBsaa	Well, you attacked him first.    Technically you did not engage in intelligent debate or say anything worth writing, you just vented and/or provoked them. So don't be surprised when you get attacked back for insulting someone.

John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. ...    11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.|`|NAL9SZuXaa	Which ever one you believe    simple  as  that  =]|`|ki0tOVUYaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Since we have observable evidence for the Big Bang (CBE and the Red Shift) and the stories of a bunch of goat herders who lived 3,000 years ago for the Genesis account, I'm going to stick with science here.|`|ojHFFpcBaa	Science has no pretensions that it can explain the ultimate origin of the universe. However, science has established that the explanations of some of the most radical Christian sects for the way the universe works are clearly in error. Religion should limit itself to man's search for spiritual meaning and leave the mechanisms for how the physical universe functions to scientists.|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	Its more likely that the universe was created.  Someone had to set off the big bang.  God created science, and man knows a tiny bit about it.  But, we think we know a whole bunch, and that evolution reached its height with human beings, and nothing is higher than us.  Except maybe Oprah and Hugh Hefner.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	They are not opposites so you don't have to choose.

Hmm, which one could that be....?|`|wkmdKFxJaa	Science is a study of what exists so FAIL. Earth was created by gravitational forces. We don't know much about pre Big-Bang.

But the earth has to be at the right distance to the sun at all times or life on this planet would not be possible !!! Another theory you can answer to !!! Expanding universe ???|`|AA10746669	By creation of God.    There is not one shred of evidence for a big bang.  It is the best evolutionists can do without simply accepting the fact of creation by God.  True science is observable, repeatable, etc.  The Big Bang is an extremely far-fetched theory.  Things that go boom do not produce order, but a chaotic mess.    There is far too much complexity in the world and even the universe for it all to have happened via mindless random chance.      There is no possibility for life to spontaneously erupt from non-life.    God is the creator of all life and the entire universe.      There are far too many symbiotic relationships in nature for evolution to be a valid theory.  For example, bees cannot live without flowers and flowers cannot exist without bees.  So they each had to be created at the same time for each to exist.  There are literally hundreds of other examples.    There continues to be more and more evidence for creation -- increasingly mounting death blows to the flaky, non-scientific theory of evolution.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	and why can't they both be true?|`|Nu6HaIfgaa	Well, Christ is true.

Science had little to do with the creation of the world, if by "science" you mean the methodology that humans invented to help them investigate and understand repeating and replicable phenomena.    God, however, set up the laws of nature that produced the world.  Whether he got more directly involved than that is best left up to individual opinion, as it has absolutely nothing to do with our salvation.|`|KueK03T5aa	God is our Father and creator....    Genesis      1       In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth,  2       the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters.  3      Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.  4      God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness.  5       God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." Thus evening came, and morning followed--the first day.  6      Then God said, "Let there be a dome in the middle of the waters, to separate one body of water from the other." And so it happened:  7      God made the dome, and it separated the water above the dome from the water below it.  8      God called the dome "the sky." Evening came, and morning followed--the second day.  9      Then God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered into a single basin, so that the dry land may appear." And so it happened: the water under the sky was gathered into its basin, and the dry land appeared.  10      God called the dry land "the earth," and the basin of the water he called "the sea." God saw how good it was.  11      Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth vegetation: every kind of plant that bears seed and every kind of fruit tree on earth that bears fruit with its seed in it." And so it happened:  12      the earth brought forth every kind of plant that bears seed and every kind of fruit tree on earth that bears fruit with its seed in it. God saw how good it was.  13      Evening came, and morning followed--the third day.  14      Then God said: "Let there be lights in the dome of the sky, to separate day from night. Let them mark the fixed times, the days and the years,  15      and serve as luminaries in the dome of the sky, to shed light upon the earth." And so it happened:  16      God made the two great lights, the greater one to govern the day, and the lesser one to govern the night; and he made the stars.  17      God set them in the dome of the sky, to shed light upon the earth,  18      to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw how good it was.  19      Evening came, and morning followed--the fourth day.  20      Then God said, "Let the water teem with an abundance of living creatures, and on the earth let birds fly beneath the dome of the sky." And so it happened:  21      God created the great sea monsters and all kinds of swimming creatures with which the water teems, and all kinds of winged birds. God saw how good it was,  22      and God blessed them, saying, "Be fertile, multiply, and fill the water of the seas; and let the birds multiply on the earth."  23      Evening came, and morning followed--the fifth day.  24      Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth all kinds of living creatures: cattle, creeping things, and wild animals of all kinds." And so it happened:  25      God made all kinds of wild animals, all kinds of cattle, and all kinds of creeping things of the earth. God saw how good it was.  26       Then God said: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and the cattle, and over all the wild animals and all the creatures that crawl on the ground."  27      God created man in his image; in the divine image he created him; male and female he created them.  28      God blessed them, saying: "Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and all the living things that move on the earth."  29      God also said: "See, I give you every seed-bearing plant all over the earth and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit on it to be your food;  30      and to all the animals of the land, all the birds of the air, and all the living creatures that crawl on the ground, I give all the green plants for food." And so it happened.  31      God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good. Evening came, and morning followed--the sixth day.      Glory to our Father in Heaven...through Christ Jesus...Amen    With love...."D"|`|4KF4v3Dcaa	Something cant form out of nothing. Everyone who thinks science randomly created us is not smart.

AyEkA6Flaa	It can be unsettling for a parent to hear that their child is gay or lesbian.    Rather than face many jarring prospects --    -- Your life may be more difficult than she had expected  -- You might be at greater risk for illness due to STIs  -- She may never have a grandchild by you  -- What will others think: relatives, friends, church    Right now it seems easier for her to live in denial and pretend that you are straight.    But the truth is, if you were dating a girl, she would not be telling you that you were too young to know if you liked girls.    It's really good that you have dad on your side.  Eventually, she will likely accept this piece of news about you.  Down the road, she may even be glad that you are precisely who you are, and who you were meant to be.    You are in this for the long haul, and time is on your side.  Talk to your dad and get his thoughts on what your mom might be feeling and thinking, and how to handle this.  Likely no one knows her better than he.|`|a432b51e0a46f5957270f47cd8423553aa	She's trying to make an excuse to salvage you from homosexuality. Explain to her its not your choice and whatnot and if she doens't understand straight away, jsut give her some time|`|pB55nws3aa	Don't ignore the issue. I think you and your dad should talk with your mom, not against her, and just basically explain that you can't control who you're attracted to. Tell her that people as young as 10 can start feeling attractions towards people. You can prove that to her by asking her, "When did you start liking guys?" If she says when she was older than you were, then maybe that's possible, but she needs to understand that most people are different from her, and she needs to accept you. By the way, don't talk to her alone. It seems like your dad understands and accepts you, so get him to talk to her with you. But if that doesn't work, then just give her time to deal with it. She viewed you as a straight boy all your life, and now you gave her this new info about you. Just give her time to let it settle in.|`|WFYtrtRmaa	17 isnt too young...be free. think for yourself =]|`|AA12006309	I bet if you asked your mother, she could tell you the first time she crushed on a boy was before she was seventeen years old.  If her feelings were valid then, your feelings are valid now.    It sounds like you have a pretty good ally with your dad, kudos!  Give your mother time and don't press the issue.  She'll hopefully get used to the idea.  If not, it's a sad truth, but a lot of us live with unaccepting family members.

uG3lPB9xaa	i'm trans, i had suicide thoughts for about half of my teenage years (i'm 27 now)... i didn't really cope with it... i just decided that it wasnt the best option (i'm fairly happy about it now :P) ... i'm the kind of person who usually puts other people's feelings before my own and i was sure it would crush my parents (i didnt have anyone i would have called a good friend) if i did something like that... i simply didnt want to cause them that much pain so i shoved those feelings away and i've never seriously considered it again (for various reasons, i just think there's too much in my life i would miss even though its not all that great right now... )|`|793OI1W6aa	Just draw a red line in your mind around suicide.

I love her so much and I couldnt imagine her without me. :)|`|jLLvmWJHaa	That's incredibly sad.    I don't find it surprising, though - as the idea of people being gay has been a touchy subject and people don't really accept it in society, thus it's given a bad name and whatnot, when in reality it's just something you cannot help.    I was once suicidal, too. I had to go to the mental hospital for about a week and then was placed on medication - but this was a few years ago.     Also if anyone who is reading this and is having suicidal thoughts because of being picked on because you're gay or whatnot...speak up and tell someone, someone to whom will understand every aspect. I believe everyone should put their voice out there and hopefully this will prevent at least some of the suicides. :\|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	yeah, i have those feelings , they come and go randomly, i can be insanely happy 1 second and literally the next second i can be really low.... i  also take pills which make me depressed, before my doc gave them to me, he told me that there was a correlation between people who take the drug and suicide, so thats not a helpful contribution, I often write poetry to deal with thoughts like that when i'm most down...... I think that you need to get help, talk to your parents and family as well as a doctor, dont suffer alone. also depression runs in my family so its not all to good either, my "freinds" kinda shun me casue they can see im different somehow, like camp (i have only told 1 that i am bi)..... I have tried a lot to try to numb so much of the pain in my life, i developed an eating disorder and almost died, i would faint about 3-4 times a day, i am now an alcholic,  i took up smoking to try and reilive stress, i take a ridiculous ammount of pills a day, and a am addicted to vitamin pills lol pathetic i know, and i'm 16  so my way of dealing is the perfect example of how not deal with depression or feelings of suicide, please just get some help, your family love you ok :)|`|d9zLKgg9aa	i have had thoughts of suicide a couple times...when me and my parents fight.. telling me that im a huge sinner and that i am going to hell if i don`t change...... but i remember about the people i`d be hurting if i did take my live away...and my friends help out through that problem... yes.. yes i have known someone who took their life away... this girl at school i had known for 3 years commited suicide because she was gay.. her sister was bashing her with hate about her bieng gay..after that..she killed herself.... =(..|`|PVYBLGFuaa	Sadly, it is true.

I know to this day I still suffer suicidal ideation, but I have no intentions of attempting suicide again.    Years of therapy combined with my religious/philosophical beliefs have helped me get past it.  Sometimes it does hurt enough to want to die, but I know dying won't help matters.    I think my favorite quote in regards to suicide is this:    The thought of suicide is a powerful solace: by means of it one gets through many a bad night  -- Friedrich Nietzsche

65QqZBnjaa	As Spooky said the one problem may be getting a visa.  I believe the Philippines doesn't allow a person to change their legal sex, so she might have to travel with a male passport.  I would contact the Philippine embassy in the UK for more information.  Once she's in the UK her legal difficulties might not be over.  I would see if Press For Change can put you in contact with legal folks who can answer questions about the legal hurdles involved.|`|AA12006309	It's awesome that you realize that the person you love *IS* a woman, through and through.   The key here is she coming to the UK with a visa that says she's a woman? or that she's a man?  She might have to visit a doctor to confirm the fact that she has completed SRS in order to change her legal documentation.  You might consult a lawyer or some kind of governmental authority on this.    One bit of advice?  Stop viewing her as a former man.  She's not a former man.  She was always a woman.  She simply needed corrective surgery to make everything match.  Good luck to both of you.
TpVE6ci6aa	"Thank you so much for the outback gift certificates that you gave to me and David for Christmas" is the correct one. After "to" the nouns become the objects of the sentence rather than the subjects, so "I" is incorrect and "me" is right.|`|YLJXyS1iaa	Thank you so much for the Outback gift certificates.  David and I really enjoyed this Christmas gift. ( it is David and I)|`|UtND0R2Baa	You were right the first time. You can figure it out by taking out the other person. You would say "that you gave to me" not "you gave to I"|`|k4NAnEYpaa	(Thank you so much for the outback gift certificates that you gave to me and David for Christmas) is the right one.

AA11198190	Yes....definitely call him.  This is your right to know what he is up to.|`|AA11635143	First things first.  This guy is a stalker and he is trying to keep tabs on your whereabouts.  You should inform Human Resources about this and have them talk to this guy.  They should instruct your co-workers that they are NEVER to give out any information about you (it's against most company rules) and they are not to confirm whether or not you're working or give out any personal information on you.    You should find another "crush" and refuse to have anything to do with this stalker.  If I were in your place, I would ask the security guard to walk me to the car.  Be alert and cautious when you leave work or go home alone until the police have a talk with that guy.  He is nuts and may be planning to do something bad to you.  This is no joking matter and should be taken seriously.|`|b3iD32hcaa	you have a stalker or a mama's boy either way at 29 he shouldn't be acting like this   run far, far away you don't want any piece of this dude|`|4wnPK7Uaaa	This guy is smoking some good stuff ~!|`|c5d588cf97b8984e46b8066408585a85aa	OK he's a stalker...call the police|`|WP0HOOJbaa	Ask him where he buys the kush, also about your name, please change it from Barack, we in the etiquette section like to discuss intelligent matters without displaying our political preferences.

I fell in love at 14, and wasnt sure about what sexuality i was.  Im 18 now, and ive been with my gf for 4 years and im bi, but more for girls.    Now to your question. Being with a girl is very different than being with a guy. For me it is much easier to talk with girls, as there seems to be more in common. My gf and i can talk about ANYTHING and she can relate somehow. Being with a girl seems so much "closer" than being with guys. On an emotional level, she is so much more Caring, loveable, sweet and amazing. Shes not afraid to tell me what i mean to her and shes so much more kinky in a way that i love.    Guys seem to mostly be in it for the sex, and thats fair enough, but when your with a girl, the sex act seems more meaningful and fulfilling. This of course is the case when your bi for women or gay.    Sex with my gf is just so much more heartfelt for me. Shes amazingly caring, warm and understanding.    Thats why women are top of the pops for me :)|`|YbPHUdKwaa	Well, I'm just naturally attracted to women over men.  It feels right.    I've dated both men and women, and dating a man feels wrong. It has nothing to do with sex. It's the connection, the attraction, the.. well, everything..    Truthfully, I have no clue how to explain it. You just know when you like a woman. Or like women over men.  It just kind of happens.     I first realized it in high school, I didn't even know what a lesbian was until high school. I dated guys all through middle school and high school, but I always broke up with them because I couldn't see them as more than a friend. It was my sophomore year in high school when I realized that I was a lesbian. I realized that I had liked girls WAY before high school, and I was attracted to girls before high school, I just didn't realize I thought different than the other girls until I found out what a lesbian was. and it just kind of clicked and everything made sense.  I've only dated women since. And I couldn't be more happy.|`|TLOgBy3caa	.......  ::ahem::  The same reason that gets straight girls attracted to men. It's different depending on the person.  I'm not shallow. I only pursue a girl if I have a very deep emotional feeling for to the point that gets me depressed watching her walk away to her next period class.  I can't just sit her and tell you why I think they are such better to a person who just thinks they like girls. This is a type of level that is so in depth it'd blow your mind.   It's like being straight, just apply your feelings to a girl.  Why is it that girls prefer guys of girls. Do they physically make you feel better? Or what is it about? i just wanna know all the aspects.  10/10  Rage this fuggin shi.|`|746b6qtUaa	I can't help my self I just like girls.

8Pro95Izaa	There are a few methods of knowing and it is not only limited to babies, but children usually know. Not sure about other communities but in my culture and community when a child starts acting up a certain way, jealous and aggresive towards the mother, it is a sign that the mother is with child.     They know becuase they are able to read the energy and in their own way "see" the child. Many times it's because the child that is not yet born makes themselves known. They show up in dreams mostly but they usually hang around the mother before their soul actually enters the body they will be born through.     Blessed Be,   Shadow Storm|`|DjCLWseZaa	probably not.

k1zMsWxOaa	No. There was bread given out to the poor of rome as a sort of dole, but the real drain was the military, in order to extablish his credibility each emperor needed a victory to cement his reputation, so rome just kept expanding, and overextending its frontiers.  By the end of the 5th century the whole empire was just a giant tax system to support its giant over-committed, over extended military and constant military conquest became the only way to keep the economy going.  This caused the collapse of trade and towns, and the depopulation that led to the Migration era and the dark ages.|`|ls9gft0vaa	No. The Roman Empire gained wealth by conquering other countries, stealing there stuff and making the best of the conquered people into slaves. You don't have to pay slaves so what they make is almost total profit and when you were done with them you get to sell them. That is why nobody wanted to be conquered by them. Slavery is what gave the Romans the time to sit around and think up and the labor for all those great building projects we visit on vacations. Caring for the poor was a way to control the populace among other things|`|AA10828835	nope.  but they did pump their water through lead pipes.

kYYHw7xEaa	That's a cute story. I wish it had been me.    I read about a Doctor who was conducting a survey on this very subject.  It goes something like this;  His elderly mother had passed away, and being that she had been very active in the community, the local newspaper had a recent picture of her taken at a local event. They published the picture along with an article about her passing. It was very nice.  When the paper came out and dad saw the picture, he was livid!  "That was the worst picture he had ever seen of her! She looked nothing like that"  The son thought it was a very good picture.  So he asked his father, what he thought she looked like.  He went and got a picture of his wife that was about 40 years old,and said "That's what she looks like!  He had not noticed that she had aged.  The son was wanting to do research on the subject.  I've never heard of any results.|`|acaJSqW6aa	Maybe she was dependent on him for the money he got her with 30 years ago when he was 60 and she was 40!  SHE knows she can't easily get that kind of money again and he could wander off. Think Anna Nichole Smith.  Or as you say...ain't love grand?    Reminds me. In the insurance business if you run up against a man who says he doesn't need life insurance because his wife will just marry again anyway. The answer to that guy is: 'have you taken a good look at your wife lately?!'|`|AA11982425	Smile!  You're on Candid Camera!    Well, maybe not, but I've heard through the grape vine that, during this economic turndown, very talented actors are picking up some extra money between gigs by working at nursing homes and providing what could be called caregiver fantasy services.  The services are quite safe--nothing that would prompt a nursing home patient to cross over the line into eroticism.  The service provider just utilizes the talents of actors to lure the patient into accepting the idea of feeling young and vibrant again.  It's all done with the power of suggestion--and, of course, the generous participation of people like you who see humor in what's taking place and play along because they understand that whether the scenario is real or an act, it's done in good taste, makes the patient happy, and brings a smile to the faces of all who are either participating or just observing.        And thanks for doing such a great job of sharing your cute story with us.  I truly enjoyed reading it.  And so I should have, because you did a fine job of telling it.  You have a special talent that not many others in this world have--even more than some professional story tellers in my opinion.  Take pride in your special talent.  Your writing skill impressed me, that's for sure.  But of course, unlike your story, my response, which I hope you'll have enjoyed, is a total fabrication.  But, hey; it could be true.  Right?  How do we know that some very talented but struggling actors aren't out there doing just that, but keeping it quiet so as to not allow the nursing home patients be the wiser.|`|7fHsyHYraa	She was looking through the eyes of love.|`|AA10405438	I think the woman knows how to make life beautiful for both of them and she sure didn't waste a second!

However, part of "love" is to accept a person good, bad and indifferent. Our bodies and minds age, but our spirits are ageless.  The best example of this...the program celebrating the career of Ernie Borgnine on AMC the other night.  Nobody would ever guess he just turned 92.  He had the same spirit as the 38-year-year-old who starred in the academy award-winning performance of "Marty."|`|rUgC7SPsaa	I don't see it that way.

el8yX5q3aa	The answer to this age old question has perplexed people for eons.    Part of the reason the question is so difficult to answer is that the amount of wood that woodchucks would chuck on a given day varies greatly with the seasons and with the metabolisms of any individual woodchuck.    Modern internet technology has advanced to the point that we can reliably monitor the amount a woodchuck chucks in real time.    The results of this monitoring are shown below.  Please note that the numbers vary due to the dispositions of the woodchucks involved.      Average amount of wood a woodchuck would chuck in a given day  605 butt cords of wood.    Median amount of wood a woodchuck could chuck in a given hour  493 butt cords of wood.    Record high for woodchuck wood chucking of 3523 butt cords  was attained on 6/15/1996 .|`|Y5032C2laa	A BUNCH|`|n99NOgHJaa	Enough of course !|`|NwpGhT31aa	If peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers....lol.|`|J7o7FtZdaa	If a wood chuck could chuck wood a wood chuck would chuck as much as a wood chuck could.|`|kov7p4Y8aa	The woodchuck would chuck the wood it wanted, while not chucking the wood it wouldn't.   Though the wood is badly needed, the limit must be heeded,  For the woodchuck may not chuck the wood, if the wood he had was chucked and gone.   But still he would chuck and chuck, til the wood was exhausted, cuz right or wrong.   Woodchucks would chuck the wood he saw, for that is the woodchuck law.  The other woodchucks could not chuck, cuz that is not their way, so one woodchuck bares the job of chuck-chucking away.  So one may say what would they chuck, if it happened a woodchuck could,  But I tell you, these woodchucks would not chuck, twere they could or should. For no one wants to be alone chucking wood.|`|89aNHoPnaa	Hahaha very funny. :]|`|MdyHKQRGaa	How much dope did the dope dealer deal when the dope dealer did deal dope?|`|UbSJPBuNaa	This is difficult to question answer. The amount of wood that woodchucks would chuck on a given day varies greatly with the individual woodchuck. According to a Wall Street Journal article, New York State wildlife expert Richard Thomas found that a woodchuck could chuck around 35 cubic feet of dirt in the course of digging a burrow. Thomas reasoned that if a woodchuck could chuck wood, he would chuck an amount equal to 700 pounds.     Some say it depends on three factors:       The woodchuck's desire to chuck said wood.     The woodchuck's need to chuck the aforementioned wood.     The woodchuck's ability to chuck the wood.   Others say:       He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, if a woodchuck could chuck wood.     If he could chuck wood, the woodchuck would chuck as much as he could!     A woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.     A woodchuck would chuck all the wood that the woodchuck would chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.     If a woodchuck could chuck wood, he would and should chuck wood. But if woodchucks can't chuck wood, they shouldn't and wouldn't chuck wood. Though were I a woodchuck, and I chucked wood, I would chuck wood with the best woodchucks that chucked wood.     If a woodchuck could chuck wood, then s/he'd chuck all the wood, s/he'd chuck and chuck and chuck and chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood.     It would chuck the amount of wood that she sells seashells on the seashore divided by how many pickles Peter Piper picks.     One quarter of a sycamore if you give him a quarter for every quarter of the sycamore he cut.     It might depend on how many female woodchucks were present. Or, it could depend on whether the woodchuck's mother-in-law was around or not. If she was, he'd be chucking all day. If not, he'd be watching the football game.     Some maintain that woodchucks could not and would not chuck wood at all.     It depends on how good his dentures are!     A woodchuck, would chuck, as much wood, as a woodchuck, could chuck, If a woodchuck could chuck wood. But unfortunately, woodchucks do not chuck wood.     About 5.72 fluid litres of wood     About as many boards as the Mongol hoards would hoard if the Mongol hordes did hoard boards.     Um....... 23????         Tons. More than you can count. Honestly. No one can chuck more would than a woodchuck.     If the woodchucks name was Maurice, then it could chuck all the wood that it wants to. However, if its name is Frank, no chucking would be for it.     Due to the average size of a wood chuck and the general density of wood (not including cork) if a wood chuck could chuck wood it would probably get through about 6.573 pounds per day, assuming the wood chuck is functioning correctly.     Using the formula: (W + I) * C where W = the constant of wood, which is well known to be 61, as agreed in many scientific circles. I = the variable in this equation, and stands for the word "if" from the original problem. As there are three circumstances, with 0 equaling the chance that the woodchuck cannot chuck wood, 1 being the theory that the woodchuck can chuck wood but chooses not to, and 2 standing for the probability that the woodchuck can and will chuck wood, we clearly must choose 2 for use in this equation. C = the constant of Chuck Norris, whose presence in any problem involving the word chuck must there, is well known to equal 1.1 of any known being, therefore the final part of this calculation is 1.1. As is clear, this appears to give the answer of (61 + 2) * 1.1 = (63) * 1.1 = 69.3. However, Chuck Norris' awesome roundhouse kick declares that all decimal points cannot be used in formulas such as this, and so it must be rounded to the final solution of 69 units of wood.     http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_wood_...    hope i helped hahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood|`|cf4c77000dd8c8bfd28c8ed28d73c296aa	It depends on what wood he's chucking!|`|u9NxzS1Uaa	a wood chuck would chuck as much as a wood chuck could chuck!!!!!!yea 2 points|`|vTNWiFPwaa	a wood chuck could chuck no amount of wood cuz a wood chuck cant chuck wood.|`|gIPHlC5caa	He'd chuck all the wood that a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood!|`|7pZOVkMoaa	Me: HOW MUCH WOOD COULD A WOOD CHUCK CHUCK IF A WOOD CHUCK COULD CHUCK NORRIS.

Unfortunately those double standards exist in both camps - prolife and prochoice.      If conservatives support war while protecting unborn children, then liberals protest capital punishment against rapists and murderers while protecting a woman's right to kill her own unborn child.    Since you seem to appreciate irony, I thought you would appreciate seeing it on both sides of the fence.    Instead of slinging mud at each other while we both argue based on partial truths and skewed perspective, why not focus our energy on the root cause of these problems instead of trying to treat the symptoms?    By the time a young girl ends up in an abortion clinic, her child is not the only casualty involved.  By the time we send a young man to war, there are opportunities for diplomacy and peace which have been missed a thousand times over.      And by the time someone ends up on death row, they have usually been brutalized and victimized themselves, before unleashing their rage on others.    So let's try to fix some of these problems - low self esteem in young women; lack of accountability in government affairs; child abuse and economic influences which promote criminal tendencies in the victims; Instead of arguing for which band aid should try and cover an amputation....    But as a Christian I can tell you there is a root which goes deeper even than these issues.    And that is the compromise we largely see in the church today, due to the absence of the gospel of Christ which was preached in power 2,000 years ago.   When a hard heart is changed and healed, then these other matters begin to resolve for themselves.  Hearts are not being changed where the gospel is not going forth.    Personal experience has taught me this.    Anyway, you keep looking for the incongruities and raise the red flag when you see them.  It keeps the rest of us accountable!  But you obviously have above average intelligence to recognize the double standards most people ignore....please use that gifting to make a difference instead of just pointing a finger.....    Best wishes to you.    Cassandra|`|J4lfOSPiaa	Single mothers do not bother me in the least!  I find them so far down the radar of expenditures that it is pathetic.

Did all of you get invites to eat off of .5Million dollar dinnerware?  I did not get that invitation!  Oh, but let's not worry about the peons who are possibly facing the worst recession/possible depression since the early 1900's.    Here is a good one you will love this - a few years back Bolivia decided they simply were not going to pay back the USA the 60 Billion dollars in loans, and our government smiled and said you may get a pass go directly to the rulers version of monopoly.  Keep it as a Christmas bonus!    Do you think we could be forgiven our debts as easily? If we let a good old fashioned fart, then we pay a tax on it.    Wake up folks lets talk about supporting war!  It has been great for certain businesses who shall remain nameless less "Cheney" get caught in the cookie jar again.  We have always been told the lie that war is good for economy!  Which economy?

Can we all spell Halliburton?    I know this is not the format, but I am mad as H@ $ that we are facing a multi-TRILLION defecit at home.  I can not conceive of such hubris on the part of the gov.  Many of my friends are facing bankruptcy and the sweet Christian couple who live next to our family found out that what they had hoped they could do is retire after owning a large chain of Ford Lincoln Dealerships, have had to come out of retirement to find work in a work force that places emphasis on young and cheap!    Let this one sink in people - for every Senator in Congress there are 4 lobbyists for the rotting core of our very fabric of good health-INSURANCE LOBBYISTS. Oh, yeah, the gov. wants you to think you have a choice in picking your own doctors by keeping the insurance companies in the seat of power!  This just is not FACT!  The American public is being fed lies by the basketfull!    I am sorry to go off in this forum, but if we don't take issue with basics then someone will take our basic issues away and leave all of us with can you say it sotto voce- because the Feds will be outside my door probably when I post this!    More and more good Surgeons are dropping out of ranks due to greater than 1Million dollars per year in malpractice insurance rates.  Yes, Doctors make mistakes we are human.  My point is would you rather have the janitor read from about 25 surgical textbooks so you can perform an appendectomy while someone stands over you holding a mirror so you can see how to do it yourself?  Panicked now?  It is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.  Yes, some Docs are millionaires and when insurance gets a million of it and taxes erode a heck of lot more, then you realize that gee I earned - take home pay- $250,000.  You are probably saying I wish I could make that per year!  You would be right, but I would rather make what a second stringer on a Professional football team makes if I were a man!  No, I take that back, I would rather be a corporate CEO who makes more money than God and lets the rest trickle down to the rest of us.  People I am in the trenches with you.  Lets see drug dealers, pimps, who else makes more money than me?  How about just about everyone.   JUST SAY IT A FEW TIMES- A MULTI-TRILLION DOLLAR DEFECIT!!! Do you know how many those little round things called a zero go behind those MULTI-TRILLION?    We all know why the gov. does not want gay rights approved.  Hey, people in the eyes of the gov. they can do what they basically want to with their own bodies but let's make them take single status so they have to pay more in tax dollars.  You won't want to hear this but the large majority of gays are in lucrative businesses and professions.  Now I am married with more children than most of you, but we adopted and then were blessed along the way with more.  I would not have it any other way.  I am a Surgeon and when I finish paying my malpractice, putting in sometimes 36 hour call/work schedules at a time and my net worth is less than $250K/year then I ask you what is wrong.  Maybe I should have taken some amp drug to be a super athlete on a woman's team.  No, I had this stupid fantasy that I was called to a higher purpose!  You bet I was taxes, malpractice insurance, and trying to put 8 children through college.    Sorry RU for stealing your thunder, but thank you for allowing me a chance to vent.

The bottom line is that:  Unwanted pregnancy's occur out of selfishness.  Abortions occur out of selfishness.  Single motherhood occurs out of selfishness.    Young men an women need to learn to love the people that they are having sex with, more than they love themselves.    Until that happens, their children will suffer. Afterall, if you cannot commit yourself to another adult, you are not equipped to commit yourself to the welfare of a child.    It would be much better if these people grow up or keep their pants on.  Either one would prevent very unfortunate circumstances for children.

n0a3ELXVaa	I'm actually best friends with an atheist, and being a Christian, I get this from him a lot. He did come to our church once and, even though he acts like a fool most of the time, he made a joke out of every aspect of the service. Maybe out of uncertainty? But I just really like this part: "My personal rebuttal is that atheists ALSO being by assuming their premise is correct." I love this. But we can't be coming back at them with this or we're just as bad.|`|nNmqP60vaa	Well I'm going to start with your additional details. You do realize people can lie, and therefore their stories are essentially meaningless when unaccompanied by evidence right? I have also yet to see evidence of any actual miracles that did not come out of someone's mouth.    We have no idea how the universe came into existence, we're looking for evidence to give us an idea instead of assuming without any evidence that we already have an explanation. And no, what you fail to understand is that, when proving something you must first assume it is false and then find evidence for it. Atheists assume the presence of god is false, search for evidence to prove god, find none, and therefore must logically assume that it is probably false. The best evidence for a lack of god or lets say dragons is the lack of evidence FOR them    Edit: I agree that Fatima is interesting, but simply because we have no explanation yet does not mean we should jump to the conclusion that it is supernatural|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That guy is an idiot because he literally doesn't know that logic deals with the form of an argument and not its truthfulness. As Aristotle ( who formalized logic) says repeatedly.     The 'correctness' [ what is that : Truth ? Validity ? What ? ] of the premise is irrelevant. You can have a perfectly valid syllogism with false premises.     An oaf of heroic proportions. Ignore him. Then he will be like 'Desiree' who seems to be down to about 10% of her posts lasting more than a minute !!!|`|tsgP2JfBaa	Your'e not helping your cause.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	It's very easy to catch atheists in their own fallacies    Simply put, anyone who puts forth an argument for or against God will have to resort to fallacies.  It will always ultimately result in stalemate    To refute your argument though, you cannot assume that a "god" is the cause of the universe since no other cause can be found.  You have the burden of proof on proving his existence which logically cannot be done    You cannot prove existence by process of elimination since an unknown can still always exist    EDIT: As far as Fatima goes, that is food for thought.  I have read a little about it and it certainly is fascinating|`|o4UrRbTvaa	Sorry again, but no atheist assumes the universe "just happened."    But actually, your "personal rebuttal" is to either delete your questions when you don't get the answers that you want, or just say "that's out of context".      Edit:  Fatima?  That's what you got?  A "vision" by children?  LOL, my nephews say that there's a leprechaun that lives in their closet, and they swear that they've seen it.|`|ID55hffpaa	Lol, do you not notice your own fallacious argument?|`|ATsdSM7saa	Here is a couple fallacies.     Out of body experiences aren't supernatural. They are caused by chemical reactions in the brain naturally. The same affect is created from the drug Ketamine.    Miracles are occurrences that have a as yet unexplained natural cause. Just because something has no answer yet, does not give anyone the right to fabricate an answer themselves out of superstition.

You don't show much of a grasp on logic, sorry.      Let's further analyze your comment:  "My personal rebuttal is that atheists ALSO being by assuming their premise is correct."  Compared to this: "Why is it that so many christians don't know the meaning of logic loop or fallacy?"    Which one overgeneralizes the other group?  I think it's YOUR COMMENT!|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	I don't bother to rebut them.  God gives us all the right to believe in Him or not.  Besides, on our side we have Christians claiming that "treat others as you want to be treated" really means "take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans."   Such evil thoughts are completely indefensible from a Christian perspective.

You take miracles for granted because you want to believe them.    I think that even if every atheist on the planet presented a piece of evidence that proved your religion wrong you would still believe.    Science changes with the times as we learn more and more. Religion is not open to change. Which is why it will force you to always have a closed mind.|`|wB3AbJyLaa	Despite all the books calling Christians to provide proofs for their beliefs, you won't see philosophers doing so, not even the most atheistic. The great majority that that strong rationalism is nearly impossible to defend. To begin with, it can't live up to its own standards. How could you empirically prove that no one should believe something without empirical proof? You can't and that reveals it to be, ultimately, a belief. Strong rationalism also assumes that it is possible to achieve the view from nowhere, a position of almost complete objectivity, but virtually all philosophers today agree that is impossible. We come to every individual evaluation with all sorts of experiences and background beliefs that strongly influence our thinking and the way our reason works. It is not fair, then, to demand an argument that all rational people would have to bow to. The philosopher Thomas Nagel is an atheist, but in his book "The Last Word" he admits that he can't come to the question of God in anything like a detached way. He confesses that he has fear of religion, and he doubts anyone can address this issue without very powerful motives for seeing the arguments go one way or the other. "I am thinking of... the fear of religion itself. I speak from experience, being strongly subject to this fear myself: I want atheism to be true.... It isn't just that I don't believe in God and, naturally, hope that I'm right in my belief. It's that I hope there is no God! I don't want there to be a God: I don't want the universe to be like that.... I am curious whether there is a God. Anyone who, whatever his actual belief about the matter, doesn't particularly want either one of the answers to be correct."|`|UO3i8BqVaa	"How can the universe "just decide" to start existing?"  You'll have to tell me which atheist suggested that.    I reckon the universe has been expanding and contracting forever.  That sounds much more logical than believing an invisible beardy space chappie waved his magic wand one morning FOR NE REASON AT ALL.    "atheists ignore all types of evidence like stories of people leaving their bodies and seeing dead relatives in Heaven"  It's weird that it's only ever devout believers who spin such stories, huh?  Do you ever even wonder how much wishful thinking is involved?    "explain the miracle at Fatima."  What?  Some totally programmed illiterate easily-scammed gullible Portuguese shepherd's kids saw Virgin Mary?  Yeah, right?  And YOU believe it because you were TOLD it was true.    Just by looking around anyone can see that sh?t happens to all and sundry regardless of thought, deed or circumstance.    I've been playing about on PlanetOurs for over 60 years and IF any breed-brand of invisible space chappie exists 'HE' would know what sorta evidence would convince me of 'HIS' existence IF 'he' wants me to know it.  So far?  Nothing; nada; zilch.  ~|`|eDYXQxA9aa	Actually, atheists generally start by assuming that a proposition requires supporting evidence. Without that evidence, the proposition does not stand. That's a perfectly reasonable position.     "Evidence" is not the same as "anecdote". People claim all sorts of things that prove all religions currently existing in the world at this present time. Why do you think that only your ones are valid?      Edit... The "miracle" at Fatima? You mean the one where a group of people who believed something would happen gathered in a certain place and witnessed what they thought they were there to see? The one where multiple people gave multiple different accounts which did not match each other's accounts of what happened? The one where people who stood around staring at the sun saw multi-coloured lights and the sun move (you go stare at the sun, see what you see)? THAT miracle? Afraid it doesn't need explaining. It's make believe. And several of the people who "witnessed" it later admitted to seeing nothing at all. Just imagine that.|`|qgxoDWs2aa	You all fail. Miserably.
p0mczaAsaa	Salam,  I don't blame you for being upset. I feel the same way with those people. They need to be reported.    On the other hand, there are people here who I proudly say that they are really good Muslims, intelligent and sincere. Some young yet very wise.  Mashallah.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	I wish people would take your advice into consideration...allow me to highlight key points for scanners:    "Do you know you are showing people that are against your religion that they have reason to dislike it because you say you follow your religion faithfully, but then act the way you do?"    "Do you realize that whether it's wrong or right that people will judge a religion based on the behaviors of those that claim to follow that religion?"    "Those who insult need to grow up and start being a good example for your religion instead of giving others a reason to find fault with it."    read it and weep!       Allah(swt) knows best|`|xuZ2y3ADaa	nope i dont do that, there is no reason to do that, and i am soft hearted u noe what i mean cool.|`|stRWElvPaa	I've noticed that they act all righteous and then if you care to disagree with them they start writing profanities.|`|nyReGoBhaa	NO!

8zDQEc2vaa	I would say probably something to do with Karma... Karma is when u do bad things bad things come back at u...maybe not tomorrow or in a week or a year,but it always catches up.  personal suggestions- watch my name is Earl. show that pretty much explains ur situation|`|ix1fMdRbaa	Luck can be passed away, like if u make any personal contact with someone or karna. that is all i got!|`|AA10455120	It's very possible that it's Karma(what goes around comes around), especially if you were stuck up and or teased people a lot.  Also, if you rely on luck, it eventually does run out. That's it's nature. Those who try harder to do things themselves tend to have better luck when they really need it. Also you may just have picked the wrong friends.|`|G17CSiL6aa	Not to sound rude or anything, but usually this happens to people because they believe they are so lucky the forget how they got lucky and they pass by important things by accident, so they make a lot of mistakes which could be the reason for your suspension and your friends turning. As for your skin, you're just getting older.
ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim - In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful    Hello.  To our knowledge, there are three types of sentient beings that Allah created:    1.  Angels.  Angels are created of light.  They do not have free will.  They exist to be perfect servants of Allah and they do His bidding without any resistance.  Angel Jibril (Gabriel), upon whom be peace, is a famous one.  He is responsible for transmitting the revelation to the prophets (except for Moses, peace be upon him, to whom Allah spoke directly).  2.  Humans.  Humans are created of the mixed soils of the earth.  We have free will.  We are not born with "Original Sin" but we do have a tendency to short-sightedness and not knowing what's good for us, lol.  3.  Jinn.  Jinn are created from smokeless fire.  They also have free will, and can choose to obey or disobey God.  Iblees was a jinn of high status who spent his time in the company of angels, and it was he who refused to obey God when He commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam.  Iblees was arrogant, thinking he was made of fire and Adam was only made of clay.  God punished him and cast him down and he became known as Satan.    Demons are not a separate creation.  The evil Jinn who follow Satan can be classed as demons, but they are all just jinn.    Fi Aman Allah,    Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|8eee24bd02326603be44e37c10b3b6daaa	jinn means DEMON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qGIexWARaa	Good Jinns are Angels and Evil one are called Demons. Some saints use Jinns just like their servants. Saints use Jinns in many ways, they use them to listen/watch others activities. Some bad peoples are using Jinns to make very bad things in this world.|`|PT49mUyeaa	not sure but maybe they make the bombs|`|VDTTzwlUaa	I am not a Muslim but from my understanding there are angels, men and jinn. Angels don't have free will are are warriors of God. Humans and jinn have free will. Jinn are "made from fire" and have free will but many of them (if not most are bad).
Lh391IV4aa	I think you'd have to ask God himself that question. Most of the religious people on this site can't comprehend that eventuality.   And most of the atheists will just deny the existence of God.  Every religion seems to preach that they are the one true way to eternal salvation, so of course they like to believe that they will have preference in heaven. Honestly, who cares? They're all welcome to their own delusions of afterlife.|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	He lets the rain fall on the fields of the wicked as well as the righteous and He lets the sun shine on the righteous as well as the wicked.   He favours every one with His love in the here and now; but still ... we do have to go to Him and when we do it must be on His terms not ours. He will show favour with those whom He knows. They are the faithful. They will find His favour in His salvation and come the judgement day He will favour those who have the salvation of the Christ.   Now there are probably billions of pagans before the Christs appearance here on earth and afterwards who do not know of God never mind the Messiah, but trust Him; He knows the hearts of pagans as well and He knows if they are righteous or evil. In other words He knows that there are pagans who did the best they could with what they had and they did it without knowledge of God nor the Christ nor the Holy Spirit. But God's love has provided salvation for the whole world and that doesn't just start from two thousand years ago. It started from the beginning, and in the beginning was the word, and the word .... well go to the book of John, that explains quite a lot about what was in the beginning.|`|tDmemV5yaa	God is NO RESPECTOR of man.  He looks at the heart of each man and goes from there.  He could care less about "religion", read about pharisees and saducees and the like.  Religous legality is demonic.  Get to know your God.  You were born to worship Him.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	He favors 'who' WANTS Him!|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Most Catholics I know do not.    God loves us all.      ?|`|JYXDj402aa	yea. it only makes sense|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Well... depending on what you mean, of course He does.    God is not some big government agency that is bound by equal opportunity laws and civil rights acts.  God can do whatever the heck He wants to.    (Just ask the residents of Sodom about that...).    The Bible is full of God helping out those who love and respect Him, and occasionally smiting those who disrespect Him.    Now...does this mean you can say "Well I go to church regular, I guess I can just cancel that fire insurance policy"?  No it does not. God will not allow Himself to be USED like that.  You don't "buy off" God.  (God created the whole UNIVERSE...what you going to buy Him that He don't already have?). God is NOT Geico.   Bad things still happen, even to people that believe in God.    But, that being said, I firmly believe that yes, God does give special blessings to those people who put out the effort to pursue a relationship with Him.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	God shows no favoritism.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Uh, there being no god, "he" doesn't favor anyone.    And there seem to be a disproportionate number of atheists with higher level educations and better jobs... so I don't think so.|`|N8wutNoLaa	no, not at all.    by grace and grace alone, lest any man should boast.  christ died for all sinners, not just us.|`|AA11676104	NO, NEVER.ALL ARE SAME TO HIM.    BELIEVERS AND NON-BELIEVERS IN GOD ARE EQUAL TO HIM.HE IS IMPARTIAL.HIS MERCY SHOWERS EQUALLY ON ALL.|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Amie,  Not according to the BIBLE.  He makes the rain to fall upon the just and on the unjust.  Have a great week.  Thanks,  Eds  ------    .|`|8nKyRiahaa	That's what fundamentalists think. For me, there is not even a god.|`|MU71ihZjaa	I believe that God loves all souls equally... but for those who truly love and obey God... they are rewarded with blessings and protection....     which has nothing to do with favor, but God fulfilling the promises of His Word..|`|xFXgkA95aa	No, all equal to people.|`|Ld16o3kYaa	no because there is no God|`|vDr5aROwaa	No I don't.|`|trMsK86jaa	I think god favors people in general, technically speaking.    Some favor, lol.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	God favors all ppl that belong to the body of christ!|`|e6brEEbOaa	I don't, the rain falls on te righeous and the wicked.  He has given us all life, free will, and He has sacrificed His son so that all of us wil have a chance at redemption.    Hope that helps.|`|Iav8FN0Aaa	I haven't seen non-religious people kill innocent people in the name of god, so yeah he favours NON religious people, because they're peaceful and do not rage wars against innocent civilians.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Yes but not always.  Here are two scriptures.    James 5:16  Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.      Also,         Matthew 5:45  that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.|`|RCn1Y3Ogaa	I think a benevolent, all-powerful and all-righteous God should favor the people who do good in life, whether they believe in Him or not, not those who only believe in Him.    -  a parent who places his child in others' care and does not show his child directly that he exist, cannot expect the child to immediately believe that he exists at all and place all his faith in Him.    It's common sense.|`|So00Bd5zaa	No. We all have a beginning and an end. Nobody has an advantage.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	All men have sinned. So we are all equally condemned, but God provided a way for us to have salvation, to be free from sin, and to live eternally. God's plan was to provide his only Son Jesus as a sacrifice for our sins. We are justified by faith, and saved by God's grace. So it is our faith that enables God to have favor on us, and we can become his sons, and daughters.  So "religious" doesn't save us, but faith in Jesus does. See the link.|`|DHCwLBuwaa	I don't think he favors anyone at all.  By the way, do you think Santa Clause favors nice kids over naughty kids?  I don't leave much milk or cookies out on Christmas Eve so I'm just curious.|`|ujENFQnmaa	God loves everyone the same. He created everyone and doesn't want to see any of HIs children go to Hell. He is available to everyone who wants to accept Him :)|`|0EAHk0Baaa	The Bible says that God is not a respecter of men.  This means that he doesn't favor anyone over anyone else.  Of course it pleases Him when we give our lives to Him.  But as far as religions goes.  I think there are some religions that make God very sad and some that make Him joyous.  It isn't religion that counts.  It is the personal relationship with Him that counts.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	he shows favor to those who are saved and call on him.|`|6ec55368aa773b05b3b9440af5f7fc50aa	No,we are all his children.A loves us warts and all.In the Bible It says all have come short of the kingdom of heaven.An Jesus was who can go to Heaven.He said what is impossible for man.Is possible for God.That was the point of the cross.The free ticket to heaven for all.|`|04f345ca740404026090acf2b474e49caa	Gods loves all, but is only going to save the elect.  In that way yes, he favors those who are religious which literally means those who believes in him and obeys him.|`|m73vgcxUaa	That is kind of a Duh question.|`|FMrBBqeSaa	God surely favors those who purely rely on him.|`|A8JbIu4eaa	supposedly!!!!....unbelievers are damned to hell!!!!|`|eDYXQxA9aa	There wouldn't appear to be any statistical evidence that religious people are in some way better off than non-religious people. In fact, religious belief is often strongest amongst the poorest, least educated, with lowest standard of living etc.
fQGv81kHaa	They do block information & their practices as much as they possibly can. Thank God there is so much information about Islam today more than ever.     Your references are exactly right about this absolutely ridiculous & evil command in Islam.    It didn't take me long @ all when I first became a member of YA! that Muslims report answers that don't suit them however true the answers are. They have attempted for several yrs. now to fool nonmuslims into thinking they are peaceful. I say people who convert to this satanic cult are ignorant. I say not to be offensive but, in the sense they have not taken the time to learn all about it nor have they fully understood it before converting to it. A lot leave it within a year after converting to it; sometimes those who do are killed just like many Muslims who convert to Christianity or other religions.     Most Muslims will deny to their dying day that Muhammad was a holy man & will honestly lie/deny things that put Islam in a bad light now that some of them have become more civilized. The others are happy & proud of such an evil leader & are forthcoming about their barbaric practices such as this incident when this man & his father were killed openly for a ridiculous evil command from Islam's notorious demon possessed leader.|`|xuZ2y3ADaa	what u have deffenitley lost me no offnece but maybe i dunno peace and are u muslim, u noe what im sayin cool.|`|AA12139712	I guess your feelings are too strong against Islam and Mohammed.  I, too, feel that way and I also find Osama a novice in comparision.  However, my feelings are personal.  I do not deliberately go insulting muslims for they are nice people.  Even if I am not a great fan of Mohammed, I still respect my muslim friends.    Let them be to their fate.  Or, at least, you can express your feelings without sounding too hard on them.

da4zS4AOaa	Asian are minorities. If blacks weren't represented in the media...what do you think would happen??    "Some" Native americans and asians are also complaining but not being in the media (hollywood)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzck-_MRO...|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	I often questioned this also. I think Asian people in general aren't on TV like they should be.|`|VEoURHoCaa	i agree with sumguy.|`|wqFIC8c2aa	Perhaps people base their attractiveness on what they se in real life,and not on the media.|`|9n4MpLwvaa	There's more of an audience to cater to.|`|jG7ejIZvaa	SumGuy is right. if you have been to south east asia. 90 percent of young south east asian male and female consider kyoko fukada prettier than aishwarya rai. most ppl find the women in their race look prettier than another race.    Edit : Can you tell me which girl look prettier?  the first link or the second link?  I know some asian girl who said that the girl in the second link couldn't compare to the girl in the first link.  althought I find the girl in the second link much more prettier than the first link.    http://www.muekdum.com/news/images/07062...  http://www.flickr.com/photos/9100687@N05...|`|NnqhtP2raa	Holla at all my INDIANS who AREN"T asian but INDIAN...|`|hx99vpeGaa	I want to know who the h*ll told you that lie. The fact that your not in the media should say alot right there.|`|AA10932291	come on, who would see black women more attractive than asian women????? are you kidding? In whole black race you can find just a few attractive women but they are always mixed.|`|AA11700517	First of all, you do know that America only has 4% Asians, right?! Second of all, do you know that America has big discrimination against Asians? It's not because Asians aren't represented more, it's because there are very few Asian to represent and the fact that Hollywood does not want to represent them. If you go to Asia, Asians are very much represented.     But on the other hand, these are some BEAUTIFUL Chinese female celebrites in Hollywood:  Gong Li:  http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/emp...  http://www4.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Shang...

I'm sure you already know Lucy Liu, Jet Li and Jackie Chan are the most famous Asian celebrities.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Asians should get just as much media exposure as other races and yes REAL TALK people most men find that white, Latina, and Asian women are more attractive than black women. Go to any forum that asks which race of women is more attractive and you will not find too many that say black women are.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Well...you're Black. That means that you're 100% more likely to watch media involving black people and thus, youre 100% more likely to see beautiful Black women.     For people of other races, however, thats hardly the case and since blacks are only 13,5% of the population our views arent held as 'mainstream' or 'typical'.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	First of all, I believe that all there are attractive people in all races and there are unattractive people in all race's as well.    The reason why African American women are more represented is because Blacks make up a WAY larger percentage of the population than Asian Women in the United States. Asians make up less than 5% of the population and Black People make up 13% of the population, who do you think will have the most products aimed at them?    What's the point of marketing at a 5% demographic when you can market towards a 13% demographic and make more money, which is all what companies want.|`|ry2XcFm6aa	because there's more blacks in U.S. than Asians...simple...    edit: yeah and people tend to put all asians in one group...you know what i mean? like people only consider "east asians" asians..you get me..?
54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	It's just a way of smearing people they think will harm their way of life.  They feel threatened because you represent a truth that they can't face.|`|wqFIC8c2aa	Because they feel yoru rejecting god bbecause you have some weird alliance to satan and your a lost soul. Silly Christians.|`|OuI5eFcmaa	As a christian I can tell you that there is a lot of hate aimed our way too (you can note the posts before mine to know that's true).  Religion is one of those topics that can make you feel judged (even if you're not actually being judged) when discussing it with someone who has a different view. Politics is another one of those topics.|`|EFjrJmdXaa	Well a lot of atheists I meet are not decent or kind. Being decent and kind in certain situations doesn't make you decent or kind. If you are decent and kind to some people but rude and hot headed toward others then you aren't actually decent or kind. You either are or you aren't. Some atheists "can" be decent and kind, given the situation. But a lot of atheists I meet can be a little pompous and self assured. To me it is never good when a person is pompous or too self assured because then they act rude and condescending. To be kind and decent I think you always have to display an amount of doubt in your own beliefs, speculation, and the ability to see all sides. Being open to other opinions as possibilities is kind and decent. To be open to other opinions doesn't mean you have to accept them as the truth but it is also not good to accept your own beliefs as truth. Circumstances always change and we learn and experience new things. A lot of religious people I meet are also not decent or kind though so it isn't just the quality of an atheist. It is the quality of a person aside form their beliefs. You are either open to opinions or not. A lot of atheists and religious people are close minded, unfortunately.|`|8cuPVvYnaa	Does that happen to you outside of Y/A? I find that a small minority of people have the largest voice here. When I hear that kind of talk, I usually quickly pass that question by because it makes me upset. There will always be some people who think wrongly and act immature, but remember that just because they are the loudest doesn't mean that they represent very many. I believe in God, but I have never thought anything bad about any group of people. Only about some individuals.|`|ouWBVQJ2aa	why don't you feel threatened when u find out someone believes?    because they have to proove something doesn't exist XD      GOD DOESN'T EXIST, I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLES SAY|`|Y2Ag76kEaa	Because atheists are portrayed as evil people that dont believe in god.    I myself am a catholic, and i am friends with a lot of atheists. I dont believe atheists are evil, i just believe you need to believe in something not just science. when you have a bad day you need someone to pray to, even if its the devil.    Even so you shouldn't be discouraged and let NOBODY make you feel like you've made a bad decision because YOU know whats right and whats wrong and any decision YOU make regarding your religion is what YOU feel is right.    Just don't let them get to you and live your life every day like its your last day, even if you don't believe in a god.    I sincerely wish you the best of luck!|`|xbISxnmfaa	Im a Christian and dont care if people belong to a religion or not. Just becasue you an atheist doesnt make me angry or hate you. Its all about how people are on the inside, thats what people should judge.|`|2liwk8yKaa	I don't mainly because I never tell people what I believe in respect of religion. You must tell them if they know ,so if you have a problem , just don't say that you are an atheists and the problem is solved.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Because that's what they're told to believe by people who want to teach them to hate and fear those that don't share their religious beliefs.|`|dXDroPtfaa	I am the same way..When you tell someone that you are Atheist they automatically assume that you are a bad person by heart and a failure at life and depressed 24/7.    It's really silly.  Stupid stereotypes.|`|JYXDj402aa	i dunno    most the athiests i know are way nicer then the religious people. all the christians i know have to judge every single thing i do and point out what im not doing "right"|`|da4zS4AOaa	Atheists are normal people they can be nice, kind and all that just like religous people. If you shove your things to people that God does not exist, then your going to have conflict.    Same thing as a religous person shoving their beliefs to an atheist that God exists. They will both clush in conflict as well.    I don't mind atheists as long as they don't tell me what i believe in is wrong. I've had atheists friends but they never mentioned it until i saw it on their facebook. I don't have problems with them. They never say anything about other people's religion
8ubAwaGCaa	OK, you made me laugh.  But I would consider an oath on the Bible just as binding on me.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Perhaps we could just do a website like scriptures.lds.org or even lds.org, then it's all encompassing and no heavy books to lug around!|`|n1eXQr5oaa	Which Country?

I don't think swearing on the Bible should even be used anymore. There's a greater prevalence of different, non-Christian religions that do not want to use a Christian book. Besides, even if swearing in on whatever holy book you may use is legal, what would atheists use?|`|AA11314600	Can I be sworn in on Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion?|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	God does not like us to swear. Not by earth nor by heaven. Our word should be our word. God bless. By the way, this proves the US was never really a Christian nation.|`|00a8352416947125cb4ac2d7a0a201c3aa	I would prefer that every elected official swear upon whatever she or he thinks is the most impressive source of their personal worth and morality.  If that's a Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon, or Kama Sutra, let 'em go to it.  And let them add whatever most holy oath they want to after the official sectarian oath--So Help Me God, Allah be Praised, C'mon Baby Light My Fire.  It's their oath, not mine, and I want them bloody impressed by it.|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Yes & no.    But remember that in Islam, you can lie under oath for the cause of Islam. You can even deny Allah, if you can trick the enemy of Islam. So? Can you really trust someone swearing on the Koran?    And the Book of Mormon doesn't really tell you to be honest all the time either.    The Bible clearly says that a fruit of the Holy Spirit is truth & honesty. Mormons believe the Holy Bible to be the Inspired Word of God, so should swear in on the Bible also.    The Mormon book & their other religious literature isn't meant to be sworn on except maybe in Masonic Lodge initiations.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	No, because that's just too many books for the court guy to have to lug around.  Take pity on his poor arms!|`|qiNr0AqJaa	Mormons should be sworn in on a comic book about space aliens from the planet Kolab.  Mormons believe their Heavenly Father was once a human but accended to become a god, from Kolab.  Doubt it? Ask any mormon.|`|AA10644435	How about a quad.|`|EVby6dGCaa	I believe that in most places, this has been dispensed with entirely, but if there is a court that still swears on a Bible, I would say that it is whatever that court says it is.     Since the answer to your question is going to vary according to every local preference, I don't think a generic response is possible.    I have not heard of a Mormon being sworn in on a book of Mormon. It is perhaps something you might want to pursue with someone familiar with the law, and perhaps especially in the Utah area.    This link will be of considerable interest to you:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLU_of_N.C...|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	You don't have to swear on any book anymore.  If they insist that I swear on a book then I will swear on a Physics book.  That will teach them.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	You don't have to swear on a Bible any more.|`|AA10105819	The Bible is sufficient, since they read and accept that too.

All the celebrities who'd like to master a language go there, such as the singer Celine Dion when she wanted to learn English and now you can see the results!  www.berlitz.us    -If you do not want to attend a school, you have a advanced methods using some CD. It is expensive but can help a lot. www.RosettaStone.com    Actually I am a native French speaker and I know how hard it is to start learning a new language.

Lsa2LPrMaa	its an age old-rule tradition where people wear black as a mark of respect during funeral occasions. I would stick to wearing black.|`|AA12152549	It used to be the custom to wear black to wakes and funerals, but that is no longer the case.  Just wear something subdued in any color(s) you wish.|`|2liwk8yKaa	Did not look at your album, but any type of dark clothing is quite acceptable to wear to a funeral.

You CAN wear colors, it's just more respectful not to.    Everytime I go to funerals and see people wearing colors I always think "how lame" and when they wear extremely bright colors I think "how rude".

I personally think that purple is a good color for these occasions.|`|tBFqgU5Aaa	theyre both fine. just make sure that theyre not too low-cut. also, its best to wear natural make up and simply jewelry (post earings, pearl necklace, something to that affect). its kind of the idea of not wanting to look nicer than the bride. only in this case, you don't want to look to fancy, because its considered disrespectful to some people (mostly older ones) to be dressed in anything showy.|`|9LLKBKOmaa	Yep that's the traditional colors but nowadays more colours are accepted but nothing too bright.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Yes those look perfect as long as they arent form fitting or low cut.

65QqZBnjaa	You're correct gender identity and sexual orientation are two separate things.    To know a persons sexuality you must know how they identify gender-wise first.    If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and they attracted to men, they are straight.    If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are lesbian.    If a person identifies as male, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are straight.    If a person identifies as male, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to men, they are gay.        Transition is a long, expensive process. My transition took 4.5 years and about $80,000.  The first step for most people is seeing a GENDER therapist.    People transition when they are ready.  Some always knew and had supportive parents that allow them to transition young.  That is very rare.  To be frank most parents freak out or go into denial.  And that's a shame because transitioning early can minimize a lot of problems later.  The vast majority of folks either gone into denial about their true selves or just take longer to figure themselves out.  As a result most folks transition as adults.    What's involved?  Well that's had a hard question to answer fully except to say almost everything in my life has changed.  While that would be impossible for non-transsexual people to comprehend, for us it's not as difficult as you think.  The difficulties involved are usually financial, familial and physical.  Because we have the brain of our identified gender assuming that role is natural for us.    Much, much more information can be found here:    http://www.LynnConway.com    You said: "So it does not matter what you're biologically born as, but what your gender identity is attracted to determines your sexual orientation, right?"    Hmm the wording there is a little sloppy.  Gender identity trumps body parts.  After all it's your BRAIN that is the seat of your consciousness.  Everyone has a gender identity, even you.  The thing is for 98.5% of people their gender identity and body match.  For those born transsexual they don't.  So we transition to make the body match our gender.  To repeat: We do NOT change our gender, we change the body to match our gender.    Gender identity is how you perceive yourself.    Sexual orientation is who you are attracted to.        Hope this helps.|`|AA12006309	Transsexual and Transgender people believe their gender identity does not match their biological sex.  Many realize this from a very young age (personally my earliest memory was age 5).  Some transition young, some transition much later in life, and some choose to not transition at all.  It's variable, each person is as individual as their situation is.    Transitioning starts as simple as seeing a gender therapist, receiving hormones, and adapting your appearance to suit your gender identity.  In my case, it means binding my breasts flat, keeping my hair very short, and wearing men's clothing.  It can progress further to surgery, whether it's chest surgery (to remove breasts on transmen, or to augment breasts on transwomen), or still further to full genital reassignment.    Not everyone goes through full reassignment.  Again, each person is an individual, and transition means different things to different people.  Many people are simply satisfied to be seen as their true gender identity.  Others aren't happy until their body has been fully transformed.  Each person does what's right for them.    TS/TG persons have to undergo a certain percentage of transition in order to change their birth certificate and drivers licenses, and require a letter from their doctors proving such.    As far as sexual orientation, it's an issue completely separate from gender identity.  Orientation starts from a persons true gender identity, for example, a man who transitions to a woman is a woman, and if attracted to other women, is a lesbian.  This is regardless of her surgical status!  Pre-op, post-op, non-op is all irrelevant.  She is a woman - regardless of surgical status, and is a lesbian.    I hope this was at least semi-helpful to you.  I've placed some links below for further reading.  Good luck.|`|ka6yGZWbaa	To switch gender if they are either MTF or FTM then they are going to have to go through therapy & then get on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) then they will take a choice of weather or not they are going to go through SRS (sexual reasighnment surgery) or not to physically change there gender, & also there sexual orientation (IE what sex they are attracted to) has absolutly nothing to do w/ them being transgendered ot not.    EDIT: You gender has absolutly nothing to do w/ your sexual orientation I stated that quite clearly, I wish that people would get that through there heads.|`|uG3lPB9xaa	since everything else has already been adequately answered i'll try to say something about the age part ^^    ok i dont really know how to say it generally so i'll write a little about myself...    the first signs usually show very early (i think the first time i wore a dress i was 6... but i never told anyone about it until recently... well i was doing that with a friend at that time but we never mentioned it after that)... but some kids are afraid to tell anyone, thinking its wrong that they're different... well i think i was even a little ashamed... just because i thoughts its not the "right" thing to do... my parents are very liberal its just that i grew up in a small town and i dont know... i didnt want to be different from other kids because i saw what they did to kids who were ...  that didnt really change much so i never came out to anyone... later, when i became a teen and the differences became more apparent i always wished i could be a girl, even if it was just for a short while... well that wasnt possible and i definitely wouldnt tell anyone because they surely would have thought i was freak and i had a hard time finding friends anyways... besides, i though it was just a phase, that it was just somehow a projection of how much  i wanted a girlfriend... um right, that didnt help either (although i did forget about it for a while but love does that... ) ... but hey, who'd know? i'm a guy, i like girls, completely normal... and who wouldnt sometimes like to be the other gender?   and i really didnt know about the whole hormones and other things that are part of a full transition... it just never occurred to me that a "sex change" could be more than just a few surgeries after which you'd still very much look like what you used to be... yeah, i know, i wish i would have told someone (possibly someone with more knowledge), i wish i would have done some research, but there was never any indicator for the possibility that i could be a "real" girl... and i never wanted to compromise about that... not sure i want that now, but its a risk i'm ready to take...    well that was pretty much the story of my life :P it's an example of how it can be...  so my point is, you can lie pretty well about it to yourself, you can try to live a "normal" life because of your family or your social surroundings...   so yeah, there are many (although its getting a lot less due to better access to information and more information to access to) transsexual people who dont transition at a young age... and some, maybe because theyre happily married or they just accepted how they were born, never live the live that was "meant for them"...
l2qtG4yfaa	I have taken Spanish for 5 years, and only 1 of my teachers have been semi-attractive.    7th and 8th grade I had the same teacher, she was around 50 and not attractive.    9th grade I had a Spanish teacher who was in her 40s but not attractive (there were some pretty hott girls in the class though)    In 10th and 11th grade (the grade I'm in now, I took Spanish last semester) I had the same teacher, and the teacher is semi-attractive. She is in her 30s, she is attractive compared to other teachers.    I don't think I could concentrate if my Spanish teachers looked like Penelope Cruz and Selma Hayek lol:  http://entimg.msn.com/i/gal/2005_Oscar_U...|`|nRObJuJeaa	umm, lol I had a hot chemistry teacher once.......???|`|fqMWBsjGaa	If you have a crush on her, you're not straight.|`|3Gag96sbaa	they are?  ew.|`|BLvLwN4Daa	Who actually grows up saying 'I want to teach Spanish in high school'?

IqqaA2wIaa	7th day believe the TRINITY.....THE OTHERS DONT...|`|Xcri5qeTaa	It's where you put the emphasis:<br>  <br>  Mormons: funduh-MENTAL<br>  JWs: FUND-uh-mental<br>  SDAs: fun-DUHM-ental|`|yz6qXwUiaa	There are a few similarities between Mornons, Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventists, but they are really pretty small.  The differences are far greater.<br>  <br>  Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses both go door to door.  Jehovah's Witnesses do this their whole lives long, Mormons do it only for a year and half when they are in their late teens or early twenties.  Jehovah's Witnesses do it with the objective of teaching people the Bible.  Mormons may ask you if you want to know more about the Mormon church or the book of Mormon.<br>  <br>  Seventh Day Adventists and Witnesses both originally taught that the second presence (coming) of Jesus was near.  Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus started his second presence in 1914 and has been ruling as king in heaven since that time and that his first action as king was to cast Satan from heaven, which is why the world has had so much trouble since that year (1914).  Soon he will abyss Satan and bring the destruction of all disobedient mankind.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what the Seventh Day Adventists teach these days about the "Advent" or return of Jesus.  Whether they still think it is in the future or not, I don't know.<br>  <br>  We both believe in a 1000 year rule by Christ Jesus.  They believe that obedient mankind will be in heaven with Jesus during that 1000 years and that Satan will roam a desolated and empty earth alone during that time.<br>  <br>  We believe that a small number of obedient mankind will go to heaven to rule with Jesus over a restored paradise earth during that 1000 years, that Satan will be locked away where he cannot hurt anyone and in the meantime obedient mankind who are not part of the heavenly class will transform this earth into a paradise under Christ's (and his co-ruler's) rule.  At the end of 1000 years Satan will be released from his abyss, and he will be allowed to draw as many of humankind away from worship to God as he can.  At that point all who follow him will go off into everlasting destruction, while the rest of mankind will live on forever in paradise.<br>  <br>  The SDA's believe that humankind that went to heaven will return to earth at the end of the 1000 years.<br>  <br>  SDAs believe they are under the sabbath law which they observe on Saturday.<br>  <br>  JWs do not believe we are required to keep the Sabbath or any other of the laws given in the Jewish system, although we obviously don't commit murder or rape or any of the serious sins that love ,the law of love would prevent us from committing.<br>  <br>  Some SDAs believe in being vegetarian, not sure if this is a doctrinal thing or just the preference of the few I knew.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that we have any dietary laws other than the prohibition against eating or taking into our bodies blood since blood represents life and is considered sacred to God.<br>  <br>  Beyond that our teachings are VERY different.  We study and believe the whole Bible. (Jehovah's Witnesses), however we believe that the law covenant given to the Jews was cancelled when Jesus came and opened up the new covenant.  This doesn't make the Hebrew scriptures obsolete, they are still very informative for understanding history, how God views things and for many other paralels to modern fulfillment of prophesy.<br>  <br>  To learn more about Jehovah's Witnesses and what we believe go to Watchtower.org|`|MSHxYrLEaa	all i can tell you about jehovah's witnesses is they follow the bible, jehovah and jesus, nothing more, nothing less<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  edit: i understand these religions i just dont have much time at the mo. and to below, the witnesses do not believe the bible is 'insuficiant' the watchtower is a mere study aid TO the bible.|`|tnParsmlaa	With religion you have to be flexible with your opinions as everyone has their own interpidation of the written words.|`|9xwhzf6Eaa	What's an SDA|`|j5YwuVEIaa	This is VERY long but VERY thorough. You are right...there was only ONE way to worship while Jesus was on earth leaving us a 'pattern to follow closely'. The only real way to find the 'accurate knowledge that leads to everlasting life' is to 'dig for it as for gold and silver' as the bible says. So work is involved as far as research and study.<br>  PLEASE get your bible as that is the only true way to learn.<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s Witnesses<br>  <br>  Definition: The worldwide Christian society of people who actively bear witness regarding Jehovah God and his purposes affecting mankind. They base their beliefs solely on the Bible.<br>  <br>  What beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses set them apart as different from other religions?<br>  <br>  (1)?Bible: Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the entire Bible is the inspired Word of God, and instead of adhering to a creed based on human tradition, they hold to the Bible as the standard for all their beliefs.<br>  <br>  (2)?God: They worship Jehovah as the only true God and freely speak to others about him and his loving purposes toward mankind. Anyone who publicly witnesses about Jehovah is usually identified as belonging to the one group—“Jehovah’s Witnesses.”<br>  <br>  (3)?Jesus Christ: They believe, not that Jesus Christ is part of a Trinity, but that, as the Bible says, he is the Son of God, the first of God’s creations; that he had a prehuman existence and that his life was transferred from heaven to the womb of a virgin, Mary; that his perfect human life laid down in sacrifice makes possible salvation to eternal life for those who exercise faith; that Christ is actively ruling as King, with God-given authority over all the earth since 1914.<br>  <br>  (4)?God’s Kingdom: They believe that God’s Kingdom is the only hope for mankind; that it is a real government; that it will soon destroy the present wicked system of things, including all human governments, and that it will produce a new system in which righteousness will prevail.<br>  <br>  (5)?Heavenly life: They believe that 144,000 spirit-anointed Christians will share with Christ in his heavenly Kingdom, ruling as kings with him. They do not believe that heaven is the reward for everyone who is “good.”<br>  <br>  (6)?The earth: They believe that God’s original purpose for the earth will be fulfilled; that the earth will be completely populated by worshipers of Jehovah and that these will be able to enjoy eternal life in human perfection; that even the dead will be raised to an opportunity to share in these blessings.<br>  <br>  (7)?Death: They believe that the dead are conscious of absolutely nothing; that they are experiencing neither pain nor pleasure in some spirit realm; that they do not exist except in God’s memory, so hope for their future life lies in a resurrection from the dead.<br>  <br>  (8)?Last days: They believe that we are living now, since 1914, in the last days of this wicked system of things; that some who saw the events of 1914 will also see the complete destruction of the present wicked world; that lovers of righteousness will survive into a cleansed earth.<br>  <br>  (9)?Separate from the world: They earnestly endeavor to be no part of the world, as Jesus said would be true of his followers. They show genuine Christian love for their neighbors, but they do not share in the politics or the wars of any nation. They provide for the material needs of their families but shun the world’s avid pursuit of material things and personal fame and its excessive indulgence in pleasure.<br>  <br>  (10)?Apply Bible counsel: They believe that it is important to apply the counsel of God’s Word in everyday life now—at home, in school, in business, in their congregation. Regardless of a person’s past way of life, he may become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses if he abandons practices condemned by God’s Word and applies its godly counsel. But if anyone thereafter makes a practice of adultery, fornication, homosexuality, drug abuse, drunkenness, lying, or stealing, he will be disfellowshipped from the organization.<br>  <br>  (The above list briefly states some outstanding beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses but by no means all the points on which their beliefs are different from those of other groups. Scriptural basis for the above beliefs can be found through the Index of this book.)<br>  <br>  Are Jehovah’s Witnesses an American religion?<br>  <br>  They are advocates of God’s Kingdom, not of the political, economic, or social system of any nation of this old world.<br>  <br>  It is true that Jehovah’s Witnesses had their modern-day start in the United States. The location of their world headquarters there has helped to make it possible to print and ship Bible literature to most parts of the world. But the Witnesses do not favor one nation over another; they are found in almost every nation, and they have offices in many parts of the earth to supervise their activity in those areas.<br>  <br>  Consider: Jesus as a Jew was born in Palestine, but Christianity is not a Palestinian religion, is it? The place of Jesus’ human birth is not the most important factor to cons

Most people think that there r logical answers to these things, but u never know........ my proof is... it was saturday afternoon, and my cousin and i were running through the woods in her backyard. it was storming really badly, and there was lots of fog. suddenly, there was a flash of lightning and a REALLY LOUD clap of thunder. We felt as if we were being trasported into a past experience. We heard a loud scream and felt people pushing past us. It got really windy(common) and there was fire. i heard someone screaming "stay out of the fire! the lightning might strike again!" NO JOKE! ever since then we've had nightmares and strange things have been happening...

Adam and Eve were supposed to be thankful to God for their creation. Sadly, they decided to obey Satan by disobeying God.  (Genesis 2:16-17) And Jehovah God also laid this command upon the man: From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. 17?But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.    Then when people had increased in numbers, they decided to build a tower...God did not approve...    (Genesis 11:4-8) They now said: Come on! Let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves, for fear we may be scattered over all the surface of the earth. 5?And Jehovah proceeded to go down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built. 6?After that Jehovah said: Look! They are one people and there is one language for them all, and this is what they start to do. Why, now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be unattainable for them. 7?Come now! Let us go down and there confuse their language that they may not listen to one anothers language. 8?Accordingly Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth, and they gradually left off building the city.    And as they went, they took religion with them...and all the religions changed over time to the thousands we see today.|`|u6Wyxmuvaa	Who cares about them|`|z6fF9Fsoaa	Because it's part of life.

You believe in a god but you also have this book where God tells you some of the answers. People don't want this life to be the end, especially since there are a lot of people who suffer throughout their lives. People also want to see their family members again.     For some the fear of going to hell might be enough to drive them to a certain religion that will protect them from that (the religion they see as having the highest probability of being true I would assume).    Religions that don't have a written book (or if the book is just a theological book and doesn't claim to have any "supernatural proof" such as prophecy or other divine knowledge) seem like they would be harder to have faith in.     For instance, deism is the belief that God created everything, set it in motion and basically retires; he does not interfere with mankind. There is no written book and the only theology you have is that there is a god (aside from what you develop through logic and reason). In that way it is possible you cannot be as sure about your eternal destination since you haven't been told by God what happens.    I just wish that we could know for sure about what will happen so we can just live our lives and not have to think/worry about it.    Nobody (I would think) wants their eternal destination to just be dying, rotting in a grave, being broken down into smaller parts and recycled in the huge circle of life. For me, I would PREFER there to be a heaven. Preference does not make something true, but I really like it if it were true. I would love to see my grandparents again, and actually get to know my grandfather the way he was before he got sick.    Now, now, don't bash me for putting something Biblical here, but the writer of Ecclesiastes sees life as purposeless without God. "So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one that comes after me."     "Meaningless, meaningless says the teacher. Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless."    Meaningless, a chasing after the wind is how he felt about life without a god and that view is, to me incredibly depressing. What does it matter what I gain in this life if I am only to lose it? Why is life worth living if my life story were condensed it went something like "he was born, he did some things, and then he died." There is also talk of how possessions and "worldly" activities don't ever fully satisfy you, i.e. you keep having to get more stuff or do stuff again and again and again.    Everyone knows the inevitability of death, and it extremely scares a lot of people. Me, I don't have a problem with religion as long as it doesn't cause pain to other people. Amidst all the bad that religions have inspired there are many people who are inspired to be very good people because of religion.     I personally just like to hope that in some way people will be brought to justice for the evils they have done in this life (taking into account their sanity, if they were under duress, etc.) and then after they underwent their punishment they got to go to heaven. I don't have any proof for it, but it is a nice thing to hope for.

VeXDGn62aa	First off, my intention is not to offend anyone with this answer. I'm merely putting what I think here.    I think sometimes people don't understand gay people. They can't fathom why we would want to be with a member of the same sex and not the opposite sex. Because of this, they don't know how to react. It's human nature to not react well to what we don't understand. A lot of people just aren't educated about homosexuality.    The media coverage, or whatever you want to call it, that the gay community does get most often (in my opinion) is pride parades. What are pride parades infamous for? Everyone parading around dressed like a slutbag. That's not the message we want to send to 90% of the world, some of which don't understand us. Wonder why people sometimes say homosexuals are more "sexual" beings than heterosexuals. Because that's the message we give off from pride parades.    Another reason might be, for example, if a heterosexual male finds out a gay guy likes him, people might think the heterosexual is gay. (?) I've seen it happen a few times at school, it's kind of ridiculous. If anything, you should be happy that someone likes you. If someone of the same sex likes you, there's probably members of the opposite sex that will like you as well.    note: I understand that sometimes people are forced to repress their sexuality completely and kind of "let it out" at pride parades, but it's not helping the gay community towards acceptance.|`|AA12006309	No idea?

AA11232725	Have you been to a doctor to see if you might have a chemical imbalance that is causing you to be depressed?<br>  <br>  If you are OK medically then it sounds like you are looking to see your own will and personal agenda come to pass in your life instead of seeing what God's will for you life is.<br>  <br>  That's the short, over the Internet, guess analysis.

Most likely, you need to strive for something that motivates you. And highly likely, you may be harboring hidden resentments toward things that deteriorate the mind into fear and depression.  Take a good hard look at the things in your life and your emotional reaction towards them.    Just the fact that you say "my crap life" is evidence of how you are reacting to your environment.  It all changes with a change in attitude.|`|j6GVLXgDaa	well, like someone else said, the bible never guarantees a happy life with Christ until the resurrection|`|i48kxrbaaa	Stop waiting for change, and do something about.|`|AA11703455	First, as a Christian that has depression is not related to a lack of faith. This is from personal experience. <br>  <br>  Depression is often an unbalance of body chemistry. Get to a doctor and discuss this with him. Maybe you need more advanced help, seek it out.<br>  <br>  Second, often a solution is to turn your focus away from yourself.  Look to see how you can help someone else, either inside the faith organization you belong to, or to others out in your community. When others show you that you are appreciated and your efforts and love have value again, it may give you some balance in your life.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine that Christians in the first century also suffered  from depression.  Paul had a brother that came to aid him, and became depressed. Paul wrote to the Philippians this:<br>  <br>  25?However, I consider it necessary to send to YOU E·paph·ro·di′tus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but YOUR envoy and private servant for my need, 26?since he is longing to see all of YOU and is depressed because YOU heard he had fallen sick. 27?Yes, indeed, he fell sick nearly to the point of death; but God had mercy on him, in fact, not only on him, but also on me, that I should not get grief upon grief. 28?Therefore with the greater haste I am sending him, that on seeing him YOU may rejoice again and I may be the more free from grief. 29?Therefore give him the customary welcome in [the] Lord with all joy; and keep holding men of that sort dear, 30?because on account of the Lord’s work he came quite near to death, exposing his soul to danger, that he might fully make up for YOUR not being here to render private service to me.<br>  <br>  Plus, I don't know how close you are to the members of your faith, but Paul gave direction to them, too. This is in 1st Thessalonians:<br>  <br>  14?On the other hand, we exhort YOU, brothers, admonish the disorderly, speak consolingly to the depressed souls, support the weak, be long-suffering toward all.<br>  <br>  They may have resources for you.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to an article on depression and mood disorders. This may give you a starting point.|`|AA11220299	Obviously you have started your Christian life with a completely wrong premise. Christianity always looks outward to others but you are looking inward towards yourself. Why does it matter if you have a crappy life if you are concentrating on making sure that others don't?

Praying doesn't cure anything.|`|XNGRQlmDaa	I really don't know if this will help you or not, but it has been my experience in my Christian life that we are either going into a storm, with in a storm, or just coming out of a storm. This is just the way of things. The Bible does say that those who live godly in Christ shall suffer persecution, but don't fret, because the Bible also says that all things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to his purpose. Nowhere in that verse does it say all things are good, but instead that they will in the end work out to be a blessing.  Another thing to consider is what you are praying for. What I mean by this is. Are you praying for God to direct your path, or are you praying for God to give all the desires of your heart. If you are praying for guidance then you need to be patient, and let God lead. If you are instead praying for all your hearts desire, this is not going to ever happen, for the heart is deceitfully wicked above all things, and God is not going to give in such a way. God will supply your needs, trust me on this one I know from experience that he will. <br>    Another thing to do to change your outlook, look at the blessings in your life, and not the negative things. Stop looking at the world around you in a glass half empty sort of way, but instead endeavor to look at things in a more positive way. Lastly do something nice for someone else today. Believe it or not you will gain a blessing from helping someone else, again I know what I'm talking about, and here is why. Up until two weeks ago I was unemployed, for 6 months, but God supplied all of my wife and my needs, not frivolities, just our needs. During this time my wife and I still did our ministry, and were and still are a blessing to a nursing home full of people who have come to love us dearly. By helping them, we gained a blessing from these wonderful people who did nothing more than let us know that they loved us and were praying for us. There is much more to the story, but suffice it to say that in time God answered my prayers for a new job, and is richly blessing this new position. Basically what I'm trying to tell you is that to hang in there, things will get better. God is just not done tuning you up yet. I also need to thank you, for as I went through and proofread this, I came to realize just how much God has blessed me. From the bottom of my heart I thank you and pray that God will touch your life as richly as your question has touched my heart.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	Trying putting aside the supernatural fantasies and take responsibility for your life.

ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim    Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah    The only time a woman has to have a mahram is if she is travelling.  It is certainly not necessary to have one every time you leave the house.  You don't have to show her proof that you don't need a mahram - she has to show you proof that you DO.  If you can have an honest discussion with her, you can ask her where in the Qur'an and Sunnah it says that a woman has to have a mahram to leave the house.  She will not be able to find this and will not have an answer.     Of course, I'm sure it will not be that simple.  As your mother, she can simply say she doesn't want you to go and can forbid you.  I'm sorry if you have difficulty and if it seems she is being overprotective.  I'd hate for you to feel you have to rebel or act out because she might not be reasonable.    There's not much you can do but be patient.  Ask her if it is an issue of trust, and does she have a reason to not trust you?  If you are a dutiful daughter, then inshAllah she should trust you to go to your friend's home.  Otherwise, you may have to ask the mother of one of the girls to be a chaperone for you, or even your mother, to reassure her.      Be patient, Allah knows that she is doing this out of love and in order to protect you.  Please, if she forbids you from going, don't try to go behind her back, and don't bad-mouth her or be angry.  Allah will bless you for obeying your mom and trying to keep the peace.

I realize you are pretty much an adult now too but... from your mama's point of view, you aren't married, she's worried about your reputation and chastity and safety, etc.  Maybe if you had an older sister of a friend, who is in her 20s attend the party, too, your mom could talk to her on the phone and would feel better about it, knowing that someone older is going to be accountable for you.  Why isn't the lady of the house going to be at home while you are having the party?  Usually moms will just leave the girls alone and go watch tv in the bedroom or whatever but it's reassuring to parents that at least an adult is there so that, for example, no boys sneak in, or whatever.  Your mom just loves you and is worried about you.  I think she's mis-using the word mahram though.  It wouldn't make sense for you to bring a mahram (a male) to a female-only party.  I think she just needs to know an adult will be responsible for you.|`|mOWyzwubaa	By the way listen to your Mother.|`|AA11176279	wow that SUCKS so bad!!    just be like.. i'm not going to do anything bad. it's a bunch of girls, and the likelihood of us having lesbian sex is almost negative. haha jk. i really don't know wwhat to say. i'm sorry!!|`|GM0kOZpRaa	your 17? and your mom doesn't trust you.

5yWkjp9baa	No rules. We do use the Way to Happiness precepts as a guide because they make a lot of sense.  In Scientology, what's true for us is what we see actually works when we use it. I make a point of practicing these in my own life and I see the difference it makes for myself and others. It's just common sense. These are in a video on the Scientology video site<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scientology.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientology.org</a>|`|yX4xVukPaa	Fundamentally, they all derive from the writing of L Ron Hubbard. There is no single moral code - it's scattered across many different texts include books and policy letters written by LRH at different times. <br>  <br>  This is further confused because morality and beliefs about the nature of reality blur together in Scientology. For example, a surprising number of scientologists really do believe that people who criticise scientology *must* also be criminals in the conventional sense. <br>  <br>  The meaning of words is also distorted by scientology. You can't talk meaningfully to a scientologist about ethics, because to them "ethics" means the internal "justice" system of scientology i.e. anything scientology says is wrong is automatically "unethical".|`|AA10985325	The religion itself does not enforce moral behaviour , since it's philosphy is that Man is basically good, not evil. That the more he understands about life and improves his awareness and abilities this innate goodness becomes his natural behaviour<br>  <br>  However , there is a booklet of moral precepts that the Scientology religion uses. It is actually non religious moral code and was written by L.Ron Hubbard (in 1982) as a common sense guide for use by anyone regardless of race ,creed or religion.<br>  It is called "The Way to Happiness" and there is an international foundation that is dedicated to a campaign of getting this booklet out and into use in various areas of society.

EmOnt7FIaa	Most Americans are considered "middle class". On a World-wide scale, we are definately considered wealthy or at-least upper middle class (when comparing the American Middle Class to the rest of the world, including South America, Africa, Europe and the rest of the World)    Well, as for the wealthy people, most wealthy individuals are considered "old money". Those are people whose wealth come from past generations, like Paris Hilton for example. Many wealthy people are considered "New money", as well, but there is not as much "New Money" as there is "Old money", even though there are a lot of people who are considered, "New Money". New money is like, Lawyers, Stock Investors, Real Estate people, etc, anybody who made their own wealth by themselves and not from past generations.    I'm going to receive many thumbs down because many Americans try to pretend that they are poor and play the victim so somebody can feel sorry for them for some strange reason.|`|jTkX9HJyaa	HAHAAHA no!  we're mostly working class.|`|B309jFKeaa	No, most people are "working class"   Not even middle class anymore..|`|da4zS4AOaa	Some families have had grandparents who are wealthy and that goes down to them easily without them doing much of anything (Paris Hilton).

SI8NXzNSaa	i don't think she'd have to worry about the cold, kind of goes with being a goddess.     I think she'd be wearing comfortable hiking gear, probably shorts and a shirt, good boots. Wearing a quarrel and carrying a crossbow or long bow. She preferred the bow, since she was a hunter, and I don't think she'd change that for modern times.     I also don't think she'd wear any of the Camo style hunting clothes, since she was very proud of her hunting skill, and I don't think she'd want to use anything that would take away from that skill, why i figure just hiking gear, and a bow and some arrows.    Don't forget that she'd probably have a group of women with her, since she liked to hunt in a group, maybe Girl Scouts troop?    Could be something there with that, Girl Scout troop, with her acting as troop leader, could be a more modern version.|`|70nLbKKjaa	hmm...intersting. Well, Artemis was a very strong feminist/nature-lover. So she'd probly wear whatever was safe for the environment, and the inner girl in her would make her want to at least keep up in style. So try and go for a simple girl, who loves the planet. Mmm...a T-Shirt and worn jeans with Converses should do it. And a ponytail. And a tote.
5vA7kkeyaa	Agree 100%|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	no you won't get the same reward, you must learn how to read it in arabic.|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim    Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah    If you read the Qur'an in English (or whatever your native language is), understand it, implement its teachings in your life, and never learn a word of Arabic, you will have a greater reward than the person who is fluent in Arabic and who has memorized Qur'an, but who does not live according to what he reads.      Yes, it is good to try to learn Arabic in order to understand the beautiful recitation in the original language, but the Qur'an is not just a book to be memorized and parroted.  It is to be understood and lived.      There are two good books that you can read online.  Google "Towards Understanding Islam" and "Islam in Focus".  They are available online in .pdf form.    Fi Aman Allah,    Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|Ca29B3eiaa	I think so. I can read Arabic but with difficulty. I heard that reading it in Arabic is better, though the more you struggle while reading it the more reward you get. So, someone that is not very fluent in Arabic reading the Qura'an gets more reward then someone fluent in the language!    Good Luck :)|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	I am translating one to Zooloo we should all be killing each other very soon over here in Africa|`|N8QLKpCMaa	not sure !  but i guess you read in arabic and then get it  translate in english , now see the logic i have , HOLY QURAN is simply understood to thoses who are arabic or know it but like i n you dont know arabic but we cant do in our own languages , you get a copy in which under verses translation is written !  that would be perfect !  ALLAH bless you !|`|X5gmVvMDaa	of course Allah sent down the qur'an and you have people to translate it in our language so we can learn and follow it!      And if We had sent this as a Qur'an in a foreign language (other than Arabic), they would have said: "Why are not its Verses explained in detail (in our language)? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?" Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur'an) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand). (41:44)|`|oGVvEl3Maa	http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...    warm regards...|`|VmcCEBcmaa	I just learned about this in my Intro to Religion class actually.. ya, it's just a custom. Children grow up learning Arabic in their families cause it's been that way for thousands of years. It's considered a sin to the mainstream muslim world to read it in any other language. Judaism can be this way sometimes too... the temple communities have their sermons in the original language of the Old Testiment, I think that's Hebrew. And catholics used to be the same way too once upon a time! It's all very strange to me...cause I don't think you should have to think so hard to get a meaningful message. I mean, what's more important...the way you display the word, the cultural coating over the word, or the meaning of the word. I mean...it's just your understanding of it that should be most important. I mean... if they're worried about something important being lost in translation... meaning it made sense in arabic and wouldn't in english...then what's the importance of it? The Truth should be universally understandable and be relatable to everyone if it is to truely pass the ultimate test of the entire world, NOT just the people smart and determined enough to learn another language. The important stuff should transfer well enough over to another language. It's like saying if you can't remember something, it wasn't important enough from the getko. I don't know why there is a big disposition in having it in English or any other language at that.|`|dAcNaajsaa	By all means, go ahead and read it in english. if you are a believer in God (one who submits to God and testifies to the prophethood of the final prophet chosen and sent by God, Muhammad (pbuh)), then whatever you learn and implement based on proof that it is what god loves will get you reward.     So a condition for getting reward from god is that you do not do shirk - make partners with GOD.    18:110. Say (O Muhammad ): "I am only a man like you. It has been inspired to me that your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God i.e. Allah). So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord."     If you are not a muslim yet, therefore, you will not get reward from GOD for merely reading the Qur'aan and even applying parts of it in your life if you do not submit to GOD by accepting islam and saying the 2 conditions which are declaring that none has the right to be  worshipped but GOD alone (Allaah) and that Muhammad was the messenger of GOD.    However, if you were to be sincerely looking for the truth, then perhaps the reward for your striving and good deeds will be that they will lead you to accepting islam.    Otherwise, if you choose not to be muslim, and apply some of its beautiful teachings, then no doubt, that is better than not following any of the guidance of God.    At the end of the day, the facts are that we didn't create ourselves or the universe and neither do we sustain it. All this macro and micro organisation and life did not logically come and cannot come from dead unintelligent matter or many creators. If there were many creators, there would be choas as each would try to overcome the other. hence there is One Supreme being who is alive and wise and intelligent and powerful beyond our comprehension. Of a neccessity, this being, GOD, must be eternal as if God were not eternal, then he would need to have been created and being created means there is another creator. For there to have been an eternal line of creaters creating the next creater would require an eternity to get to this point in time where we are now located. Since eternity has no beginning in this way, it would be impossible to get to this point in time and hence for there to have been an eternal line of creators is an impossiblity and is illogical.    So this Creator is intelligent and so has not created us for no purpose. The creater who has given us all neccessities and luxuries etc to live, eg, food air water  has not forgetten to give us guidance on what exactly we are to do here on earth and for what he has created us. So he sent guidance from himself from time to time by raising one of our own, a human, amongst us to teach us through the revelation he gets directly from GOD. These men are the chosen ones who are known as prophets and messengers.     When the teachings of Abraham became corrupted, The Creator sent another prophet and so forth. When the teachings of moses in the tawrah which christians call old testament became corrupted, God sent other prophets such as jesus. (eg, first book of bible, genesis has 4 types of incest and mentions on the first few pages that God was walking around in paradise looking for Adam and had a rest on 7th day... God having a rest ???) ... then when jesus came, after a while, people started worshipping him and broke the first commandment to worship the ONE true GOD ALONE. Then God sent Muhammad who is the last messenger. There is, eg, no need to send another messenger with a new book like the Qur'aan because God has promised to preserve the Qur'aan. and God has kept his promise.    Likewise, paradise and hell is true and one logical way to understand it is that as mentioned, the universe is created perfectly balanced. On earth however, we can do all sorts of crimes and still manage to stay away from harm and being punished. So where is the great balance and justice in this part of God's creation? so this means the day of jeudgement and a divine reward and punishment is neccessary. So that proves paradise and hell and day of judgement from a rational logical and scientific point of view.      As you can see, in islam, we have proof AND faith AND an unchanged book from GOD that is the same as it was when it was revealed.    So having researched into this and of course, there is much more to this than i can type here, i accepted islam as the truth. because what is most senseless is that we have been created for nothing. That there is no creater when all i see around me is creation and so, the proof of the creator.     So if you are not muslim yet, or are muslim and are returning to your religion, then I welcome you to read the Qur'aan with an open mind and an open heart looking for the truth and calling out to THE SUPREME BEING, the ONE who created you, to guide you ... and then when the truth becomes clear to you, and you are a person who loves truth, then you would accept the truth by the permission of GOD. Just like, i|`|SpebXPpLaa	first read it in Arabic then read English translation......|`|UhyvM73iaa	It is better to read in English than not reading at all.    But truth is you will get only less than 25% spiritual enlighten as compred to if you learn Arabic language and read Quran in Arabic.  You will  learn that some translations are are better than others.  You will also start feelings the miracle in the words of Quran written by Allah SWT.  Arabs can not memorize their text books of any subject written in Aabic. But not only Arabs but non-Arabs who don't know Arabic at all can memorize Quran from cover to cover. When they keep reading Quran's Arabic text with English translation over and over, the meanings of test sinks into our memory lots sooner.  I am non-Arab, can not speak Arabic language  but when I read Quran I am understanding the meanings of  30 to 50%% words of the Quran. When you memorize short surahs of Quran completelty with good understanding the meanings to recite during prayers after Surah Fatiha with full understanding of what you are reciting then you will feel that you are talking to Allah, the words will be coming out of your heart and you will feel closeness to Allah with spiritual presence  with you during salat.      You will understand what I am telling you, only when you will reach to that level of understanding the meanings of Quran and start enjoying the blessings and mircals of Quran.|`|v93T1z2Aaa	I will give a little information about Quran     Allah has sent down miracles, revelations and messengers to give clear proofs He exists and more important, what we should do once we come to this realization.    Allah has sent prophets and messengers with many proofs throughout the ages for people to be able to clearly see with their own eyes and to be able to use their own senses the miracles and proofs pointing to the fact, Allah does in fact, exist.    Miracles of prophets and messengers of Allah have come to people through the ages. Moses (peace be upon him) showed many miracles to pharaoh and to the children of Israel. Plagues, locusts, water turning to blood, his stick becoming a snake, the voice in the burning bush and the parting of the Red Sea are clear miracles for the people of Moses time.    Again, Allah sent Jesus, the son of Mary (peace be upon him) with clear miracles for the people of his time. Speaking from the cradle while still a new born infant, creating birds from clay, curing the sick, giving sight to the blind and even bringing a dead man back to life, were all clear signs to the people to know Jesus (peace be upon him) was a messenger of Allah as was Moses before him.    Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last and final messenger of Allah, and he was sent to all of mankind. Allah sent him with a number of miracles, not the least of which was the Quran. The predictions and prophecies of Muhammad (peace be upon him) have come true even in this century and the Quran has been used to convince even scientists of the existence of Allah.  [Please visit "Science Proves Allah": Watch video of famous scientists admit Quran is from Allah and even accept Islam]    The Quran is the best of proofs for the existence of Allah and today over one and half billion people memorize and recite from the exact text, in the exact same language it was revealed in; Arabic. More than 10 million Muslims have completely memorized the entire Quran from cover to cover, and can recite it from memory without looking at it.    --------------------------------------...

NQ3eETlYaa	Just because he doesn't kiss or hug you doesn't mean he's gay...What a messed up stereotype. And he may not want sex at all. Who knows? Ask him.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	He might just be shy....|`|Cpr6Ff5laa	there's nothing yo ucan do ur boyfriend is a raging homosexual and you just got owned|`|AEAxZEveaa	What signs do you have other than no pda's?    Hmm, I don't know. Somethings up. That's kinda weird that he moves away when someone comes by. I don't know if he's gay or not, but something's wrong with him and I think you need to throw this one back. Can you really see yourself marrying someone who doesn't want to kiss you in public or have sex with you?    Edit: Hello goodbye: just in case you read this, how is not wanting to kiss women a messed up stereotype of gay men??? Haha, Isn't that the definition? Wanting to be with men and not be with women?|`|FJPKtZN5aa	yeah i agree with the other person that said this he could just be shy|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Talk to him about why he has trouble showing you affection. That is something that the two of you are going to need to work out even if he is completely straight. And no, just being uncomfortable with affection doesn't mean he's gay if thats the only reason you think so.|`|AA12006309	You're not really giving us much to work on.  Some people just aren't all that physically affectionate.  Everyone's an individual.  Until he starts eyeballing men or you walk in on him and his gay porn collection, relax.  It's probably nothing.|`|oeLAXHDnaa	You give no reason to think he may be gay, or perhaps he is having issues with you, and it has nothing to do with his sexuality.  Not to say you are at fault or anything, but maybe, just maybe it is not about him not being able to be affectionate with women, maybe he is having a hard time being that way with you.    My first instinct is he is feeling guilty, and wont allow himself to enjoy the time he has with you, have you two always been like this, or is he treating you like a "sister" new?  That is how guys in general behave after they cheat, but of course, I could be wrong.....without more information who knows?    Again, unless you can tell us what makes you thinks it's his sexuality in question, don't jump to any conclusions, just communicate.  If he wont open up, then you should consider moving on anyway, because you are bound for more of the same in the future if the guy can't open up to you in the first place, if he is gay straight or bi it makes no difference if he is a closed book.    addition:  With the added information I would say he seems like he is probably Gay.  He is just not ready to deal with it yet, so instead of trying to force him to come out, which he will resent you for, just lovingly break it off, just don't tell him why, he will no doubt freak out if he is not ready to be real, and really, why put yourself and him through all the drama?  just come up with a reason like "It's not you, it';s me" and find someone who can really be in the same kind of relationship you need.  Because He doesn't sound like he will be able to give you that, so why kill yourself over it?  Just let him come to terms on his own, and you move on, asap.    Good luck,|`|BBzxxMOqaa	maybe he was sexually assaulted recently or during his childhood, something else completely separate from his love life is bothering him or the fact that you're constantly nagging him is the reason. I'm not going to hide the fact that it may be a possibility but I doubt it because if you are relating this to how gay guys would feel, these are really VAGUE stereotypes especially in regard to the not wanting sex part? maybe he cherishes his virginity a lot, wants to sustain it until marriage, or is insecure about his body. he's happy most of the time or maybe that's what you want to hear but it's impossible for somebody to be happy 100% of the time. and you really don't know whats going on with his mind. i say that as his girlfriend, he should be comfortable enough to talk it with you or else...I dare say it...find another man that is willing to give you the mutual compassion that you're looking for. You keep thinking that you can change him. Only he can change himself. Maybe he might change and say that he wants you back but I'm willing to bet the new guy that you're with will be ten times better. It may not be right away but you will find the guy you're looking for. You're just wasting the time that you have by making that search longer. If you can't resolve these things now, what about marriage (unless you don't mind getting divorced a couple of times)? He might just be shy but even in americanized standards in the land of opportunity, he might have to tone it down a little bit because it will get him nowhere in life. One thing I know 100% sure: he's DEFINITELY not ready for a relationship, and YOU ARE. Do the math.
aCOJYTIVaa	NO I do not - I have emphysema from smoking for too many years!    Am now on oxygen 24/7 - not only would it be dangerous because of the oxygen, but smoking in general will kill you and STINK UP THE HOUSE!    Good question - have a star!    CJ|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	No, none of the people I associate with smoke. If someone came to my house, they had better ask before lighting up, so I can tell them to get outside and do that. My mother tried lighting up in my car many years ago after I had quit smoking. She couldn't believe it when I stopped the car and told her to get out. I now have a life threatening allergy to cigarette smoke, which when I get hit in the face with smoke, will trigger an instant asthma attack requiring an ambulance ride to the ER. It's not fun to instantly not be able to breathe.|`|0HfrBEBJaa	I used to smoke ---nothing serious and always other peoples and loved my ex's last one--- perhaps that was one of the reasons we parted. He used to get sooo annoyed. I guess I was lucky never really needing to light up except for a good reason. I still like the smell of smoke and we have an open fire that occassionally smokes so any one smoking is OK. Probably associate the smell with marriage or perhaps just men so I guess I miss that smell......|`|XhwxmP7vaa	it doesn't bother me but if it did..they'd have to take it outside..|`|vOYyFqxRaa	We used to back when everybody smoked but now almost everyone has quit including me so we don't allow smoking in doors and I really don't like it out on the patio either. Some smokers are so rude and toss their ciggy butts on the ground. I hate that.|`|hallarIxaa	No I don't want the smell in my house or my car.|`|AA11570788	No I don't. People who smoke have to go outside. The smoke gets into clothes, curtains, and furniture.|`|3VXGLhnMaa	Certainly not.The stink is hard to shift.I have asthma anyway,|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I would, but my wife hates it, so smokers go outside. I was a heavy smoker for 45 years and I enjoy the smell. I would still smoke except it makes me deathly sick and unable to breathe. Plus it is so expensive!|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	No...I have allergies to smoke and hate it!!!|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Although I haven't been able to kick the habit, NO ONE smokes in my house or car.|`|AA10240238	Seeing as how I am a smoker alone in my own   house, yes, any smokers can come and smoke  inside.|`|YvqSM4jYaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT! I don't even smoke in my house. In fact, I quit smoking over 10 years ago. Anyone who would smoke in your house is very rude. It isn't socially acceptable anymore like it was in the 60's and 70's.|`|AA10353121	No....I have a sign that says  If you must smoke keep yo butt outside.|`|lebSL2yaaa	No, and if they smoke outside my house they better not throw their butts on the ground.  No slobs allowed.|`|kjvGggH6aa	Definitely NOT! I can't stand the smoke!|`|XVZMXBwNaa	I smoke in my house, so if people want to smoke, it's OK by me.  I try to smoke outside, when the weather is nice, spring and summer, and fall before it gets to cold. But in the winter I will not go outside to smoke.|`|SDHmVDlNaa	No I get horrible migraine headaches when someone smokes around me or even if I smell the clothing of someone who smokes and comes into the house.  I have signs on the wall in the living room  "Thank you for not smoking" and a  "NO PUFFIN" on the door outside.  No one has ever asked me if they could. Well that and I start crying when ever I see someone light up around me.  I can't help myself.  I had a Dad and a father in law who both died of Emphysema.  It makes me so sad to see someone young smoking because I know that some day their family will suffer and have to watch them die by inches like I did my dad and father in law.  It was like losing my dad twice.  I wouldn't wish that sort of death on my worst enemy.|`|987923b8a7fffddd6d84106ce71d68a3aa	No way! My husband smoked for many years,in the house,wherever. When he quit smoking we had the carpet replaced throughout the house and no one smokes in the house now.|`|iPEv1lRBaa	No, I have kids.|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	Hell no!|`|UUJ5SqrAaa	Nope they can go outside!|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	NO NO NO NO|`|H41u0B8Jaa	If I invite people over who I know are smokers then yes I have a designated room for them to smoke in.   I don't like it myself however if they are my friends and I invite them to my home I want to make them feel comfortable and not like social outcasts.|`|2liwk8yKaa	Yes as I smoke too, but hate it when I have to wash walls and curtains a lot more than a non smoking household.|`|AA10462593	I don't even know anyone that smokes, so no, no one smokes in my house..I got a big surprise tho when we spent 4 months on the East Coast..every where we went people smoking, and having to request non smoking areas in restaurants, our businesses and within 20 feet of their doorways are all non smoking areas..most Californians are non smokers..|`|AA12316366	"nope"!|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Since we quit, seven years ago. people just naturally seem to respect our house.  They go out into the yard, or at least sit on the porch steps.  We haven't had to say a single word about it.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Absolutely not & same for my car!!!|`|5qFmukWwaa	Never!  Even when my husband and I both smoked we never smoked in our own home - always went outside.|`|a4LWildhaa	No never. They can outside and use a pop can as an ashtray.|`|FGCjgc8Raa	Never ever, far end of patio only. Not near an open door or window. ever  and if children are present no smoking any where outside either.  NEVER in the cars.|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	Nooooooo.......  And the smokers I know don't expect to.  They automatically ask where, outside, can they smoke.|`|8j70Neqeaa	i dont smoke in my own house.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Years ago when I smoked I went out side to do so. I stopped 20 years ago. no one smokes in my house, even the President would have to step out on the porch to smoke his cigar.     Poppy|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Nope, we don't smoke and prefer that no one does in our home or in our vehicles. Texas State Legislature is in session and the legislators are going to vote on Texas becoming a smokeless state in public buildings. We are not the first state to go this route but we finally got smart. I hope !|`|AA11296212	No, sorry, out you go!  While working for the newspaper, I once gave the mayor of our town a ride home, and I told him not to light up in my car.|`|oP3VVW5raa	No way !|`|ur3vgbXoaa	Everybody I know has quit.  They didn't want the big C   and they couldn't afford to buy them  and they got tired of smelling like crap.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	No.  I don't even let smokers in my house, they stink even when they aren't smoking.  The smell makes me sick.|`|207dFmdHaa	we dont let people smoke in the house, but they can smoke on the decks, in the garages,  we have deck access from almost all rooms in our home....I have kids, and I dont mind if people smoke, but just not around the kids or in the house|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Neither my husband or I smoke but if we have company and they would like to smoke we say it is OK. We feel that they are our guest and we want them to feel comfortable. It's not that big a deal. After they leave we air the house out.|`|AA12038658	We don't smoke, but most of the people we know do. The only time it bothered me was while I was pregnant, and then, and after she was born, my husband went into another room or outside to smoke.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I don't know anyone that smokes and I wouldn't allow it.|`|80lWqRFiaa	Nope, my son has asthma and that is not allowed.|`|acaJSqW6aa	No, never and people know I'm allergic to all smoke. With the the first wiff of smoke my throat starts to constrict and my eyes  swell.  Not a pretty sight.|`|gAiBzHS6aa	Absolutely No!  I live in Senior Retirement Apts and should I allow it anywhere on this property, eviction!|`|ehnxg6Utaa	no|`|nwnILcEAaa	No, If I can't, no one else can either. I have a bench outdoors if someone wants to sit there and smoke, but nearly everyone else I knew that smoked has quit, too. I re-painted all the walls in my house and just don't want smoke indoors anymore. It is too difficult to remove.|`|AA11767291	Never. No way .No how . No time . It's a matter of life and death . Mine.  I choose to breathe !|`|xyt9NdjVaa	No, my husband goes outside to smoke. He says if he has to go out, so does everyone else. I said. 'ok, fine with me.'|`|mBHQEzd1aa	Yes and No.  If it is nice outside the kids go outside but if its zero out I turn on the overhead fan and let them smoke one or two.  I can't stand a lot of smoke.  I'm allergic to it but a little bit doesn't kill me.|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	No Way!!  Smoking should never be done in a house!!|`|983da09dc3ea0ef9d60b736fb7da884eaa	if it is a major party then yes I do as I will be scrubbing everything down after-wards, but in general everyone goes into the sun room to smoke.    I smoke but if I go to some ones house that does not allow it, then I follow their rules, after all it is their house.|`|7fHsyHYraa	No, I don't allow smoking in my house.  I can't even remember the last time anyone asked me if they could smoke in my house, or my car either for that matter.|`|aPxmZq00aa	No way. I live in Florida and there is never any reason anybody here needs to smoke in the house. I have a covered front porch if it is raining.|`|AA11722373	Wow, this is a very good question to say the least. I was a smoker until Oct.11th last year. I got a new job on the 7th of Oct. One of their rules there was they were a non-smoking warehouse. I smoked the first 3 days of work and then after that laid them down as I smoked my last 2 that morning, Saturday.    Before I laid them down, I smoked in my house (travel trailer) all the time, I never went outside. I smoked in my own truck, but never in my parents truck or house as they are non-smokers.    Then when I laid them down, I decided that if I was not smoking I didn't want any one else smoking in my house either. I went out and cleaned my truck up inside and out. I was really shocked as to how much YELLOW came out of it. I then decided to start working on my trailer as well. I am still working on it to this day as I want to try to turn it into something really nice. Every where I look in here I see the yellow. I still have a lot of work yet to do in here to get all of that out. Once it is clean, I plan to paint it to. Now that I don't smoke any more, I don't allow others to smoke in my truck or in my house.    After seeing all the yellow that was in my truck and is in my house, I wished now a million times over that I would have never ever smoked in my house or truck. Really I wish that I would have never even started smoking period.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	I have a daughter and a son (our of six) children that smoke.  They are now adults and make their own choices.  However, they do not smoke in our house when visiting and my daughter does not smoke in her own house.  She is in Real Estate and tells us that the minute she opens the door of a house she is selling, she can tell us whether smokers own it or not.|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	Nope. Not in my house, not in my car.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	I smoked until 6 years ago - and I used to smoke inside, had to wash the walls periodically to make them clean again. I hate to think of what this might have done to my kids lungs ! One of them  - my son -  smokes now, and I remember asking him why he took it up. He said, "I once saw you ransacking the house to find money to buy a pack of cigarettes - and I figured that smoking must something pretty special to make you do that"...how guilty do you think that made me feel?    Anyway, I'm rambling on here - no, nobody smokes in my house, but I do have sympathy for smokers, being a reformed one, so they can smoke on my deck. I even have a few nice ashtrays out there, so they don't feel like lepers. I don't mind being around smokers, I just don't like my house to smell of smoke.|`|AA11616170	Absolutely not.|`|66ATKuknaa	No, they can smoke outside.  It's unhealthy to have smoke in an enclosed space.  (Wish I realized that when I used to smoke.)    FYI, approx. 30% of the Wyoming population smoke compared to approx. 20% of the national population.  Wyoming businesses are finally beginning to go smoke-free.|`|24vQ8D71aa	no way. i give my smoking visitors a comfortable spot outside .  it was a tough decision i made some years ago , resisted doing it for a very long time as i did not want to offend my friends .guess what? nobody really minded , and i lost no friends.|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	No, and they respect that.  I've never had anyone argue with me about it.      Have a Senior day.|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	no, I tell them my fire alarm is sensitive and it will go off and ruin our hearing.|`|8e8f00fc5b9e9edb3247392086ec523faa	yes
HRXTcAxQaa	they have to get used to you and after that you will be treated like the rest.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	you're going to have to work to make friends. theyre not gonna come to you.  just be nice and friendly and youll be fine.  also remember to join a sports team or club!!  edit: okay, you dont have to do sports... join the band at your new school.  what i meant was join SOMETHING. it helps you meet people.|`|dXDroPtfaa	I am kind of in the same situation as you. I have loads of friends here. I'm so carefree. I'm moving this summer too-and I'm freaking out too. What people have told me is that;  There is ALWAYS that one person that goes up to "The new kid" and talks to her, trys to make her feel at "home".  At first it will definitely be hard, people may look at you if you look "different", that's okay, don't react to it.    Eventually, no one notices you..You blend in.  Now this is at a BIG school..  If you move to a small town school..  WOW, you are screwd.  I live in a small town, I have all my life and that's why I have it so easy, everyone knows me, everyone sees each other like everyday, we walk to subway after school, etc..  BUT-I've seen how the new kids get treated here..If you look "Pretty/hot" You're safe. If you're normal, you get treated sort of like sh!it. No one really talks to you-except for the loners.   This is just what I've observed.    Depends.    Good luck!|`|BLvLwN4Daa	Frankly, if you jump in the middle of the year, they will most likely treat you regular. They won't give you special treatment. Just find someone to sit with at lunch, make good grades, & you'll be fine.
HrLYlO4iaa	Dont worry. I've had this problem before and it can be tough. But if u want something cool for your birthday, then why dont u just pick it out yourself? What i mean is, that u should ask your parents for a gift certificate like to a clothing store, music store, jewelry store, or just a shoe store. U know, that sort of stuff. Then u dont have to worry about your parents getting u something to babish or to grown up. Or too cheap or expensive. And that way, u have a good advantage of choosing your own personal gift!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That really helped me out during my birthday and im hoping that this might help u too!!!! Tell me if it works out!!!|`|1hS1pQz5aa	If you want a cat, then you should look on www.craigslist.com, because there are always lots of free cats. Many people just can't take good care of them, and have to give the away. Also look on other adopting websites.   Just tell your parents you want basic necessities for a cat (bed, scratching post, bag of food, toys, gift cards to pet stores, etc)  I think thats the cheapest thing to do (and it will make you happy)|`|C7yXxVQwaa	if you want a piano, ask them for a keyboard piano. or ask for a lot of money and save up for your own grand piano.|`|jTToxLXyaa	im sorry idk :(|`|0iGPAUBCaa	My mom's b-day is the same as yours!   Just have a party with your family and your closest friends. That's what my family does. It's fun!|`|IGz2wBj5aa	When you're looking for a piano, check craigslist.com. I bought a grand piano from a lady who lived about a mile away from me, for $200. She was a piano teacher and needed to sell it fast. LUCKY! =D Happy birthday in advance.|`|FIALhwlKaa	I know it sounds strange, but maybe you can ask them for a bday present when they will have enough money again. Perhaps they will be happy if you will prepare for them something nice, like a wonderful sunday breakfast or so. You know, everyone forgets the mum at the bday, but she was the one who gave birth that day to you. Maybe next year the situation will be better than it is right now.|`|UvSnEWHjaa	Are you in singing and dance lessons? If you are in dance lessons (I am) you can maybe ask for a new pair of tap, ballet, jazz,or character shoes. I'm not sure for singing, since I don't take lessons. Maybe instead of a grand piano, get a keyboard instead, or just a gift card.|`|H6I0vEoWaa	C'mon sure you have to think about others but on your Birthday others are supposed to think about you , who cares if they splurge on a Birthday gift it's your day girl ! Go ahead and ask for whatever you want !|`|IBSsKAB3aa	Since you like talking to friends, you can ask for a cell phone that's not so modern, like touchscreens. For dancing, you can ask for a new pair of shoes or a new costume for dancing. For singing, you can ask them for a ticket to a concert or for a opera tape or singing DVDs or CDs.

Makes about as much sense of handing in pages of nothing but footnotes when you turn in a paper.|`|4boTYkt7aa	Because most Christians want the person to read the truth for themselves and not just take their word for it.|`|tManvxfQaa	Gods Word is the Only real Truth there is....    and i quote it to you ;Rom 3:4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar;     One is to Study to learn and show themselves approved !!    2Ti 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	B/c this is the R &S section.. what else do u expect?|`|HDyqzvUkaa	I assume this springs from spiritual insecurity and need to be right.

"We wordmurder our children" Dr. Gene Rey (Cubic and Wisest Man)|`|tACJnpI1aa	I have asked this question too. Maybe it is because most Christians feel like this is the ultimate source of proof for everything. I, being Christian prefer to just converse regularly. :-)|`|E7fguoVBaa	If the Bible is what they base their beliefs on then of course, they would back up their source by quoting a scripture.   Sorry if you don't like that.  Just don't read it then.|`|AA12022105	free speech, why try to oppress it either way?  after all "Do not judge or you will be judged"|`|1cGlucXyaa	ms. m xx is right. Though I do agree that not everyone has read or understands the scriptures, even though God was nice enough to write it in simple words.|`|0EAHk0Baaa	Maybe we are just trying to give our perspective.  After all, all anyone can give is their own perspective unless it is quoted.  The Bible is an excellent reference in my opinion.  Why post a question if we don't want all different idea's and perspectives.  I thought that was the whole idea.

To heck with guys and relationships, take some time to rebuild and focus on YOU for the time being.  Find out more about you and being you.  Sometimes the best things in life have a tendency of bumping into us when we're not looking.     A bit over a year ago my bf and I broke up after 8 years.  I met a guy, and really liked him.  The bastard used me.  I brushed myself off, met another guy, REALLY loved him... he promised he'd never hurt me or lie to me, and one day he just disappeared, without even a good bye.  I was devastated.    I decided, eff it. I'm done.  I focused on my artwork, on rebuilding my life.  My new partner dropped into my lap by total random chance.  In two days we will be together for 5 months.  In March we're moving in together.  This is the happiest I've been in ages.    You never know what can happen sometimes if you just stop trying.  Good luck.
01zxefjnaa	No W|`|4WqvTAfmaa	I mostly invoke Norse gods and goddesses, although I recognize and serve all. My personal favorite is Sif, wife of Thor, although others are important to me too. I generally don't ask them for things, other than their presence at a ritual.    I ask the Powers, positive beings who are listening, giving them a listing of what I need, why, and by when, and of course how much. That usually gets an answer because I don't limit my resources. I do say thank you when I get some form of help. I generally don't say how or from where the help will come. That is because they generally have a better idea than I do how to make it happen.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	i once envoked the god cthuhga once to battle the dunwhich horror|`|u9NxzS1Uaa	aphrodite i am actually a reincarnate of her sooooo yea|`|jlF3MEzmaa	I often greet the Moon when I see her,   I am always in touch with the Great Mother Goddess, I feel much more comfort when I call to her, she is always protecting her children (in this case, us).

Go google "wicca" if you want to learn more about it.    And how you do it properly is you get educated about it first. And you treat her with Respect.

It is called racism.|`|GLzVJBpQaa	that's bull. just let her go because she is so not worth it. she seems like a racist pig, or else she's just afraid because someone messed her up. let it go and move on to someone who will love you for you and not your melanin content.|`|oeLAXHDnaa	My question to you is this:  why would want to waste your time on someone so obviously ignorant that she doesn't realize what a hurtful thing to say that is?    I would tell the racist beaootch to go fack herself, and find someone with a brain to devote all this energy you seem to have.  Find someone who finds you beautiful just as you are, and dosnt' need a lesson in human decency, as your brain dead object of your current affection does.      I am shocked you don't see you deserve better than someone like this.    Good luck.
AA10000903	I personally think jewelry is the best valentine's day gift. Flower does not last, neither does chocolate, but every time she wears or sees the jewelry you gave her, she will think about you.|`|Dle1VBhzaa	a really cute teddy with her name on it.  and custom mnm's :D you know likee the ones you can get  with like a little message on them 
AA10948829	Apparently it's a gag on "battaa utta koi," which is said by the defending team. "Batta utta koi" is like "Come hit the batter!"  Since it's a Japanese pun on a Japanese saying, it really won't translate into English so I guess "bring it on" would work.

lmOGqkMsaa	For the last two years I have been spending valentine's day with my parents due to a failed 4 year relationship that caused me much pain and grief. Anyway, to answer your question: Its a lot of fun to go to the salon with your mom and get mani, pedi and hair done. Then, go shopping. Spend the whole day doing things you like at the mall. See a movie, get a massage, sample all the perfumes, lotions and makeup at you favorite store. At night instead of going out to eat at a restaurant packed with love birds, order from your favorite restaurant and eat in. Don't forget the chocolate....VERY important!!! have fun.|`|4dtUsaYhaa	just try not to think about it. think of it as another day really.     have a nice dinner with yor mum i think tat would be the nicest thing to do|`|Wj212FWXaa	you guys can go on a double date with these 2 guys i'm sure you know.  their names are ben and jerry.  lol my friends and i used to veg out in our pjs every valentines day with ice cream, chocolates, and champagne and watch romantic movies.  quality chick bonding time.|`|zp46Txipaa	go and pamper yourself and your mother then order out and see a movie or 2|`|c4G1wqOyaa	Grab some of ur girl friends and go patying and have fun and enjoy being single!!

PS - Thanks for knowing not to use apostrophes in 50s, 60s, 70s, et cetera ... most people will put in apostrophes which drives me mental ... lol|`|eNR2iot8aa	I was born in the late 80"s but I would say the 80"s the music and and the clubs and stuff looked like just classic fun.|`|IH6Wlmqsaa	70's all the way!
VEoURHoCaa	jack is funny and also loves black women, anyways yes some do some don't from what im hearing you sound pretty hot im 15 and i like some white guys don't be surprised if you ask one out and she turns you down,but if i know you i diff date you ok it just depends on the girl.     you have a lot of things i like     6'1',slim,play guitar,baseball and football|`|wqFIC8c2aa	Are you for real?  I just asked a question like this but reverse a couple of hours ago!

She will either say yes or no. And you can't base her answer on all black girls because there are black girls like myself who date white guys and there are those that don't. It all depends on each individual. And you shouldn't date a person just because they have a nice body.|`|dAu2MkQ3aa	Yes, a lot of black girls like white guys. But it depends on the girl. I'm a black woman and I find many white men very attractive. I especially like guys that play guitar because I play guitar too. You don't see too many black guys playing guitar, so having interests in common would help you find a black girl that likes white guys. Honestly I think some black girls may be afraid to admit they are attracted to white guys, but then again white guys are probably afraid to approach a black girl and ask her out.|`|YSr8dm5faa	Some black girls dont and some do like white guys.... I'm one of the black gals who do and my bf is white. Nothing wrong with dating someone of a different race especially when you're the only one who knows what you're attracted to. I'm all for dating people who you're attracted to.    killeur: get a life and stop speaking for me ok? You make yourself look really stupid.|`|4gSxvgH4aa	no we don't stick to your own race!!!|`|1b14bdc1f90929e1a3af77ba5c63bce3aa	some do,some don't.  it depends if she talks to more then just black people then yes  but if most of her friends are all black then No|`|24xtvMwVaa	The answer is yes. If there is a girl that you like, no matter the race. If you are nice to her and persue her with no hesitation, she will realize that you are one of a kind. I am with  a cheesy white guy and he tried for more than a year. it was a close call but a very happy call!!!!|`|3r252UIRaa	Most white guys are not attracted to black girls.|`|AA10855383	Yes. I cast a few looks at those guys at the gym and the mall. And so do they. if I was single i would date a white guy, never have tho.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Honestly, it depends on the girl... some girls are totally open to it and some, not so much --  but the secret to girls is, it really doesn't matter so much WHAT you look like -- what they truly respond to more is personality -- if you have a great personality, if you make them laugh and you are sincere and honest and make them feel special -- they love that! But you can never win over everyone -- so you'll just have to give it a try and ask a few girls out!   PS the "big butt" thing just made me laugh for some reason, haha -- guys are so..... specific when it comes to body parts, haha|`|wkKJpCwRaa	Lol, yea it just depends on the actual guy himself. I don't discriminate, but just be kool with me. There are plenty of girls who like some white guys. However, guys like Jack are the ultimate turn-offs. So yea, I like White guys and there are lots of Black girls who like White guys. I'm sure it won't be hard for you to find one you like.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Sure they would. It depends some girls want to date their own race and some want to go outside of that.    The problem is both of you's parents to accept     i'm black|`|uQfJukisaa	Depends on the girl. A lot would like you if you are decent looking.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	Jack is an ***, and it all depends on the guy. Just be yourself and stay cool.|`|ry2XcFm6aa	in Y/A alot do.. i noticed...lol...you wanna get buried deep huh...? yes they do homie...|`|7q7r9zXVaa	I like white guys however I perfer black men. If a nice white guy wanted to date me there would be no problem. The biggest problem is that white guys don't find black girls attractive.|`|d4051d51dfeeaffbacc0cefba16f3210aa	Like everyone else has said, some do some don't. I have a friend that would never date white dudes & I have another one that is dating one right now. I personally would, & YOU sound sexy as hell. :)|`|6tHA0QQXaa	I am very curvy the way you described and I like white guys.But not all black women do.I have dated white guys just as i have dated black guys.You really have to just watch and see how black women act around you.If they are friendly,then they would more than likely be down with that,Most black women Admire white guys who can appreciate their beauty.So Just watch,and you will know who you can talk to.Nice to know that you are not afraid to show that you like meat on your bones :-)  Happy Hunting|`|645da791a07e16987148c95ba7ac99f7aa	GLORYUS WOULD LOOOOOOOVE YOU !!|`|ObQo3DBNaa	black girls are DESPERATE for white guys.

It's a matter of preference.
EmOnt7FIaa	No they are not. they are of "Austronesian descent", Austronesian people are a race of people that has very similar facial features as black people, except they may be a little lighter. Austronesians and the black people of Africa are not related in anyway anymore than any other racial group is. During the Slave Trade, no African Slaves were taken further than the Middle East, and those were just a very tiny percentage, the vast majority were taken to the Western Hemisphere. There are not even many whites in that region.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	No they are not.|`|0l1ZairMaa	To get an accurate answer to your question,  wouldn't it be better to approach the guys at your school in a friendly manner and ask them the questions you've asked us?

In our genes, He made us bigger so that we live on our stored fat to last through the long sea voyages that we did from island to island, over the vast Pacific.  We do have asian influence with genes being traced back to Taiwan, yet being half black, ummmmm maybe not. (at least not Samoans).  I agree with Marika, Samoans seem to be the only ones that blacks don't mess with, maybe because we are on the same side against the common enemies.

hokVzfJYaa	Strange is it not that people would object to a demonstration of love? If they think that kids should never see people kissing each other it surely is sad. I have had people making comments on me holding hands with a girl or kissing her on the street. I just then say hello to them with a big smile. Most of the time they are ready to start running away. Love could be contagious...Poor slobs.|`|GVw4WKaQaa	Let them talk. and think what they think.  but the parents who cover their kids eyes bother me. they're giving them the wrong impression!|`|nQiLLqGeaa	This question bothers me.    The same way that kids who dress in emo/goth/punk/whatever clothes scream "WHY DOES EVERYONE JUDGE ME?!"    The thing is: If you put yourself out there, if you act or look different, you are going to be looked at. Don't do it in public if you don't want to be looked at.    It's not that everyone who stares hates it. It's just nothing something they typically see. Imagine if they went into a gay bar - they'd do double takes for the first three minutes, but after that, they'd be used to it. You do it too, I guarantee it. When you see something different or strange, you take a double look.    When I dyed my hair pink, I got a few funny looks. Plus, I also own a cloak (a real one, not some cheapass cotton thing from Walmart) during the winter sometimes. Heads turn. Do I do it to make heads turn? No. But do I know it's going to happen? Yes.|`|AA12006309	Next time blow them a kiss with your lesbian cooties.    Jeez.  Sometimes I really hate people.

SsEAvhs7aa	Why don't you put your pants up and tell him about YOUR feelings instead of asking the whole world about HIS? You want to know something, give informations first. Then you might receive an answer to your question if and only if he wants to tell you about it. Anything he does short of seeing him kiss another guy won't give you any answer anyway. It might suggest you something, but it might mislead you too.    Willow, what you are suggesting here has a name. It is called stalking, and it's freakin' rude.|`|MhfneF0xaa	Wow, none of the information you have given is at all relevant to whether he is gay or not.

He could just be a jerk. Keep a close eye on him, see who he looks at and for how long, pay attention to who he talks to the most, and after you think you have prof invite him over one day and lightly bring up the subject of homosexuality( like talk about someone you know that is gay and had a bad relationship, or a actor in a movie that is gay, like the guy that plays Ryan in High school musical he gay in real life) and study his expression when you say it.

I am an adoptive single father. My son's half-brother is racially mixed. I have tried very hard to help my son and his brother deal with this issue.    As it turns out, my son's half-brother has been rejected both by the white community and the black community. I don't have a lot of contact with this boy, but I know that life has been very, very difficult for him.    I truly wish this were not so, I am not prejudiced by any means, but I can only report what I know to be the truth.    I can only hope that your child will not encounter the negative reactions my son's brother has.    You might wish to consider living in an area where racial stereotypes are not strong.

We are almost all bi-racial to one degree or another, especially those who do not even realize it.  So I think you have nothing to worry about, and you shouldn't give it another thought, your child will  be beautiful and even more so if you love it unconditionally.    As example, I am a "Mayflower Society" direct descendant and my ancestors are Swedish, Norwegian, English, Welsh, French, Scottish, Irish and Native American...whew!  Having studied my tree has taught me none of that matters really to anyone else, they base judgments on what I look like only.  How can you argue with that kind of ignorant thinking, so why stress it at all?  The only that really matters is that you love and nurture your child regardless of what he or she looks like, and it really should not matter to you at all.|`|SsEAvhs7aa	I adore babies, must they be white, black, yellow, red, olive or even purple with lime green spots.

bMuwuAVOaa	You want words to describe what a mermaid is...    A mermaid is a mythological aquatic creature that is half human, half aquatic creature (e.g. a fish or dolphin). Various cultures throughout the world have similar figures. The word is a compound of mere, the Old English word for "sea," and maid, which has retained its original sense. Mermaids appear to have the tail of a fish and the torso of a woman.  A more poetic description would be...  Long flowing hair with porcelain skin and a face of a goddess  Yet below the waist the scales and fins of her tail shimmer in the water like thousands of tiny rainbows.|`|ix1fMdRbaa	Their actually called ''mer'' They r half human from the waist up. Half seal from the waist down.

You could contact them if you're interested in helping.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	Finding organizations and activities will be difficult because  of  your  age and the legal  risks that go  along with it.    If you belong to a church, there might be some activities where you can tag along and help, while the adults in your life can be reasonably assured you are in "safe hands."    Otherwise, is there any chance you and one of your adults could go in on something together? Aside from solving legal hassles, it can be useful to work side by side with your folks in a situation where other people are "in charge" so you can just enjoy each other's company.    Hope this helps. Best wishes.

b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Tantalus. His punishment was that he must eternally sit in a pool with delicious fruits hanging above. Whenever he bent down to get a drink, the water would drain and dry up. Whenever he reached up to get a piece of fruit, it would rise up out of his reach.     This was his punishment for killing his son Pelops. Before, the gods favored him more than any mortal. They even invited him to dine with them, which was a very big honor. Tantalus decided to see how great the gods really war. He killed and dismembered his son Pelops to serve to the gods. They realized what he had done instantly, and were disgusted and offended. So they punished him with the way I described above.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Tantalus was Greek.The story goes he butchered his own son Pelops and served him up as a feast for the gods.  They were absolutely livid when they found out what they were eating and hence this punishment.|`|zRPXczxAaa	Tantalus.

According to the 2007 U.S. Census Bureau estimation, there were 1,380,088 people of Greek ancestry in the United States,while the State Department mentions that around 3,000,000 Americans claim Greek descent.[2] In addition, the 2000 census revealed that Greek was spoken at home by 365,436 people older than five.[3] Greek Americans have a heavy concentration in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston and New York City. Tarpon Springs, Florida is also home to a large Greek American community. The United States is home to the largest overseas Greek community, ahead of Cyprus and the United Kingdom, which despite having a Greek population of less than 1 million has a larger percentage of Greeks than the U.S.      Relic66~~~?

They were both friendly ghosts and I wish they were still alive. Also I ran into three ghosts on a walk. Two were very happy and were skipping and singing, they were about 8 when they died I think. The third one with those two who looked 12 when he died, looked angry but I think he was trying to warn me that one of the two people I was with, she soon after stabbed me in the back and we haven't been friends since(which is a good thing) The other person I was with is still my best friend.

Yes there are both but I think most are lost or stuck. Due to how they died|`|3TJxmDS9aa	i believe that not all ghosts are evil. i feel that if something bad has happened to them then they might be a little mean, but if they had a loving life and everything was wonderful and they were happy then they could be helpful and kind.

UspK4SQBaa	Most likely because to some people young Black male equals young Black criminal, and they may have had people rob them who looked like you.   Almost all of us have experienced it.  I've had employees follow me and be extremely rude, and I've also had employers ask me to follow the young Black kids in the store, which I refused to do.  Meanwhile, they were being robbed  blind by kids of all races.    P.S.- There's no sense in allowing them to get you worked up.  Be yourself, make your purchases (or don't), and move on.  Don't stoop to their level.|`|tlUihEOvaa	Well I think people will always judge others base on looks.     I mean one time I was lining up at the food court in a mall. I was ordering food and when I got to the cashier I wondered why did the cost double? They counted the lady behind me because she was Asian like me. So they thought she was with me.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	All you have to do is stare right back at them. Let them know that you know exactly what they are doing and they should catch on. You might want to try waving at them when they look at you. Also, why do you keep going there? Is that the only store in the neighborhood? If not, why won't you just go to a different grocery store?    It could also be you. How do you dress and carry yourself? Do you dress "thuggish"? Do you dress in a manner that you know will scare other people, especially people who are not that familiar with African American culture?|`|3QNwf2eMaa	asians are just as racist as white people|`|M3maZgdyaa	It is not you or your race.

I was searched right out front in front of the whole story (luckily because of the time, not many shoppers were in there, but enough it was humiliating, especially cause i didn't do anything). I didn't even reach into my purse until I was at the checkout getting my money out. I'm white and so was the employee who called the cops, so I think it was because it made them nervous a young person was out so late|`|x20Xeu41aa	are they women?  Do you walk in topless?

Are you deciding whether to be with either of these two guys or not to be friendly based on your understanding of gay behavior?  You don't say how knowing if they are gay or not will serve you in your life.   If you are avoiding associating with any person because of perceived stereotypical behavior you will miss out knowing some pretty wonderful straight, or gay, person.  Some straight guys may have voices or movements that might seem gay.  And, conversely, there are gay guys who would give even the most manly man a run for the title of masculinity.   Married guys can be gay.  Straight men may seek gay sex because they don't know how to ask their wives to be sexual in the way they want to feel sexy. (think of massaging your prostrate ... would you ask your "Madonna" wife to stick her finger in your ***? Do you even know how to massage your own prostrate?  Leave the labeling out of your psyche: enjoy people for who they are in your life.  Let go of your prejudices and see who wants to be in your life.  Peace|`|VUK77SrXaa	Well, I would say that you are nosy and curious.    You are stereotyping based upon non-traditional gender behavior, and that's always dangerous.    You should assume that regardless of a person's gender presentation, you should not assume anything.  Take things at face value, so if a person is married just assume that they are straight.  If a man is dating women, assume that he is straight.  To do anything else is to show prejudice.|`|a432b51e0a46f5957270f47cd8423553aa	I have seen a kind of number 1.

8Nqq7tkwaa	i have seen our stories changed so much by people who are not natives but claim to be for selfish motives..sometimes money sometimes some strange feeling of importance. they only know what they have read in books or seen in movies so they fill in the blanks with what they THINK sounds right, distorting the real meaning of things to suit their agendas or their stereotypes.    with the internet, these false versions are spread very quickly and easily by anyone who sets up their own web page. once it has been repeated often enough the false version of the story tends to replace the actual story in the minds of many and the true culture of the people is lost.    this is why so many of us refuse to share some things with outsiders..even those who claim to be well intentioned. they tend to destroy everything they touch.|`|vGWD8Zncaa	I believe most original mythology is lost to nearly everybody but scholars or serious amateurs.

In fact, I'm pretty sure that Christianity encourages people to "turn the other cheek" and "love their enemies." I am also unaware of any New Testament teachings that encourage violence against civilians or whole groups of people. If you know of any, please post them.<br>  <br>  I don't know enough about Islam to judge, but if their Holy writings encourage violence against civilians or whole groups of people, then that would be a good reason to distrust anyone who chooses to be a member of that religion. It's only common sense.|`|AA12193600	Anyone who thinks what's going on in Iraq is about religion is a little touched in the head. One side in the conflict may utilize the lack of education and a nationalism of a sort in a religious sense to obtain power and control--but the whole thing is a simple power struggle.  Totalitarian regimes often use religion to gain secular power. One must, as a country, decide whether to do something about it or not.  While people may infer that America is a big bad bully--we simply were in a situtation where we had a country who was violating the terms of the cease fire from the first war they had with the rest of the world, were rearming in direct contravention of this cease fire--demonstrated no desire whatsoever to work with the rest of the world.  The world made a mistake in the 30's with a similiar man in germany and the world paid a heavy price.  However one likes or dislikes George Bush and Tony Blair--they basically made the choice that they preferred to learn from history and not repeat it's mistakes.

It's the case of the pots calling the kettles black. The so-called Christian soldiers coming all the way from the US attacked Iraq, killed thousands of innocent civilians and children, destroyed all major infrastructures in Iraq, for reasons only best known to George W. Bush, who himself is supposed to be a devout Christian himself. Why I might add? I wonder how Christians at large (if they do have any conscience at all) feel about this!|`|K634rh5Laa	All of the people in the U.S. military are Christians? There are atheists and agnostics in the military. Christianity isn't a peaceful religion but Jesus promoted peace. Christianity often does not reflect Christ-like behavior. It's not violent or peaceful, there is a time for war and a time for peace. I would not connect the military with Christianity because many Christians including myself do not support the war in Iraq. It is also true that many non Christians supported the war in Iraq as well as the fact that the military did not choose to go to war, the feds did.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  You seem like an intelligent person. I now understand what you mean by this question.|`|9umpVItqaa	That's a good question. As so, why do people in general claim to fear God? Still many people of various religions  would do anything, being nothing short of giving their own lives, just to prove their dedication to a flag. Could it be that they are fighting for their nation in the name of God, like many would say? Whether they are attacking innocent citizens or not, they put themselves in a negative position by fighting in war. Do you know of any religion that would not go to war at any cost? If so, likely this group is of Christian denomination. At the same time their are many people who will profess to being Christian whether they have fought or are presently fighting in war. Though this seems to be the case, this isn't in harmony with what the Bible teaches. Jesus said to one of his apostles, at (Matthew 26: 52) "Return your sword to it's place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword." This was said at a time when governmental authority was being used unjustly against the Son of God himself. FOR WHAT MORE WORTHY CAUSE COULD A PERSON HAVE FOUGHT, IF THAT WERE THE RIGHT THING TO DO? So if one who professes to be a Christian is fighting in war, its not because of what the Bible teaches. It's because of the inaccurate teachings of what man believes  God wants of us. "It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his own step." (Jeremiah 10: 23)|`|syBBnsCAaa	Christianity is a peaceful religion because Christ preached a message of peace.

Hjwp1yGWaa	Not quite, Eve's sin was Adam's sin, God has always made us to watch after each other.  Eve was a help for Adam, so he would not be alone, she was made from his rib, so they were inseparable from the beginning, she was a part of him, they were a team if one member fails the whole team fails.  Adam is Christ, Eve is the Church, in order for the Church to be glorified, Christ must pay the price.  Adam was always responsible for Eve's sin, not so much Eve, the same way we know God's will is in his question to Cain in regards to Abel when the Devil stated through Cain"Am I my brother's keeper?" we know Satan is the opposite of God, so Yes! we are our brother's/sister's keeper.  Job made sacrifices for his whole family's sin, Abraham gave Lot the choice of land to preserve their peace between one another, and when Sodom and Gomorrah fell Lot was spared because of Abraham's plea.  Always looking out for the other before one's self, the same has always been true since before time began, hope this eases your mind in regards to where blame is to be placed, blame is solely Satan's not Adam or Eve, but the orchestrator of all sin for all time.|`|lFlapW8maa	first of all Sirach is not in the Canon so it is irrelavant to the argument.  secondly Adam was the first to sin.  Adam and Eve were married.  Adam was the head of the household and was ultimately responsible for Eve.  They were together when they ate the fruit Gen 3:6. Therefore he should have said no we should not eat this fruit.|`|NsHV4O8oaa	eve did<br>  i'm pretty sure it says that she went off to her husband - he wasn't around at the time<br>  the whole point of the seducing thing was the eve was alone - decisions are harder to make by yourself<br>  plus she was the junior of the two - how much younger we don't know, but its likely eve was chosen first, because she was less experienced<br>  <br>  Sirach has nothing to do with the Bible - the approved Bible canon has the answers you need|`|crJ0fHZhaa	Good Q. But I really don't think it matters too. It is just my personal opinion. All I know is they are the first couple who sinned. And the effects of sin was passed on to us...<br>  <br>  (Romans 5:12) That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned<br>  <br>  Sirach is not included in the Cannon Law. But in 1 Timothy you will something like that..<br>  <br>  (1 Timothy 2:14) Also, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived and came to be in transgression...<br>  <br>  But the whole point is, as a couple they are the first one to sin ;-)|`|3GO5k5nNaa	Accroding to the Quran, it was Adam who was the one who made the mistake. <br>  <br>  However, The Quran goes on to say that they asked God for forgivness and God forgave them<br>  <br>  Qur'an 7:22-23   Surah Al-A'raf (The Heights)<br>  <br>  And their Lord called unto them: "Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you that satan was an avowed enemy unto you?"<br>  They said: "Our Lord! we have wronged our own souls: if Thou forgive us not and bestow not upon us Thy mercy we shall certainly be lost."|`|a8687a650a19834bc4b30491b67daa9baa	One handy thing about all things Bible is that you can pretty much interpret it however you like.

Let's put is in another perspective though.  Eve was tricked by Lucifer the greatest deceiver of man there ever was or will ever be.  How much of a chance did she have?  <br>  <br>  That dolt Adam on the other hand didn't take any deception at all to get him to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.  He just did as he was asked by Eve.  Now which of them is the greater sinner.

Was that double negative? or triple? My brain hurts.|`|gOKi1dcVaa	Are you saying that the story is too stupid to be false?|`|a8687a650a19834bc4b30491b67daa9baa	Wow.... I'm not sure where to begin with this, so I'll just note the thing that's most striking to me at the moment.... See, the thing is, people tell stories. I don't know about you, but generally by the time a story gets from my friend to my other friend to their friend to my boyfriend to his friend to me, etc, it's pretty alien from the real story. And that's all part of the intrigue. If people didn't add a bit of 'color' to a story, they would be boring. So, who knows where this story originated, or what it was about at that point. And as far as it being in the Bible, well, that doesn't help the case much as far as verifying any authenticity.|`|AA12193600	The temple curtian was torn in two from top to bottom.  Excuse me but the Jewish heirarchy was educated and could read and write--and wrote volumes.  Now--the temple curtain was very important to Judism--for it to be rent in two--and not one word written about it--when there are volumes and volumes in Jewish archives from this period--is rather like the New York Times not reporting on 9/11.  Sorry but clearly--this omission IS evidence the event never occurred.  Pliney the Elder was a Roman historian living in Jerusalem at this time--who wrote about natural wonders etc--don't you think he might have thought it worth a single line or so--when dead people walked into town--again the omission being clear evidence that the whole affair either never occurred or was exagerated.  The romans, the jews, the egyptians, and others living in the area were astronomers--there are good records of eclipses yet there was no "blotting out of the sun" recorded--if it went behind clouds--well then the biblical authors need to have their noses lengthed don't you think.  Finally there are many records of earthquakes in the area (the earth shook and the rocks split)--quakes recorded in BC and a fairly violent one in about 80 AD--yet none hit the middle east in the this time period.  Surely ya think residents of Jerusalem and those living in the area might have noticed a good shake don't you think.  Any one of these by themselves might be arguable--all of the lack of historical documentation for all of these MAJOR occurances taken together clearly shows the mythic nature of this jesus character and the crucifixiton. Add to this the 15 prior "saviors" in history who all died via crucifixtion according to their own legends--and we see clearly that the whole thing was mythical and that christianity is built on a tissue of myths and sham.  The only reason it exists today is the brainwashing techniques that all religions develop to keep the faithful faithful|`|oDR80CiSaa	Absence of evidence is NOT evidence of absence. (Then again, there is no such thing as evidence of abscence (proof that something doesn't exist), since you can't prove a negative anyway.)<br>  <br>  However, when you have two options, and one is far more likely (well, not far more likely, but makes far more sense to you) than the other, then logic dictates that you pick the one that makes more sense (to you, of course.)|`|O9omaIDAaa	>> The dead people coming out of their graves and walking around in the city was a historical event.

If they just wrote about believable things, it wouldn't be much of a basis for a religion, would it?

It's really funny to watch your pathetic attempt at apologetics.<br>  <br>  EDIT: ALL documented accounted were collected and removed from ALL other sources?

You never know.|`|mBQQL0kCaa	its boring|`|RTxFNURzaa	There are like 7 NHL players that are black my favorite hockey player mike grier is black|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	1) hockey isn't very popular in the US, so just by numbers alone you wouldn't get that many black people in hockey.    2) very few black people in Canada, where hockey is popular    3) As black people are not naturally adapted to colder environments, they get colder easier. Thus don't usually live in colder environments where its usually popular, the two top teams usually involve Canada and Russia (cold environments).

Also, games like hockey and baseball requre alot of infrastructure and money in the formative and training years.  Whereas for a sport like basketball, all you need is a ball and a basket.

T3Tpgz5Vaa	I think teenage pregnancies also contribute to fatherless children, which would deprive them of a male role model (rarely if ever do teen fathers buckle down), thus you lose family stucture.     Also Its harder for the parents to get an education if the female is pregnant, which in turn makes it harder for them to raise their standards of living.    The first link shows that teenage pregnacies have been declining for everyone over the years. It also talk about which states have higher rates, ect. Also it will allow you to calculate it just for the african american community.    The second link discusses the health risks invovle for the women and the child in teenage pregnacies.    "Children born to teenage mothers are less likely to receive proper nutrition, health care, and cognitive and social stimulation. As a result, they are at risk for lower academic achievement." a quote from the second link      http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/2006/09/1...  http://www.womenshealthchannel.com/teenp...|`|fscgp7iFaa	People are just biased|`|PnpmPcrTaa	Nice lips|`|AEAxZEveaa	Hmmm, I don't know how you would compose this paper.     I would look at it more from the perspective that poverty is a factor in all of this. Poverty stricken areas have a higher rate of pregnancy, higher rates of crime, and higher rates of minorities. I think if you're looking for a correlation, you need to include the poverty issue.    edit: nevermind, I realized what you're saying: teenage pregnancy as a cause of juvenile crime. Do you have access to a search engine that finds research articles? You could probably find some really great articles that way. Are you looking for a thesis statement or just ideas of what to write?|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Well, many teens that become pregnant at a young age tend to be impregnated by a guy who is "less established",     Okay, this is extremely hard to explain without sounding offensive.    Many females who become pregnant are considered, "at-risk youth". Many young people who get into legal trouble are considered, "at-risk youth". An "At-risk" female is more likely to associate herself with an "at-risk" male, in comparison to an individual who is not considered "at-risk". "At-risk" children tend to come from household were values are not emphasized, so, they are more likely to practice such risky behavior as unprotected sex.     So to sum everything up, a teenage girl is more likely to get impregnanted by a teenage boy criminal than a teenage boy non-criminal.|`|xK981es8aa	From my experience in the school system, teen parents tend to want to be their child's friend instead of parent.  If you have a child at 15 or 16, your opportunities will automatically be limited.  So either work like a dog to make a better life for you and child and hope that your support system doesn't buckle during those first few years or just float along with whatever which results in not learning the life lessons that come with rearing a child and being broke.    Though it's rare in my city, there are teen parents who turn out to be super-strict disciplinarians for that reason.  And most of the time it works.  The child born to a teen parent is too scared of their mother to end up in the system-sometimes it motivates them to excel in life.|`|y73Y4aEPaa	idk, why dont u do a paper on alll the races? why errrrthing gotta be pounded on the african americans? goshhhhhh, not all of them are ghetto u know!|`|pofFe2HEaa	Id say there would be a link. The reason being, people that stay out of trouble, keep there grades up and dont party all the time would tend to keep there virginity longer. Those that go off and party, get drunk, and do drugs would be exposed to sexual relations and would not be in there right mind and would submitt too these actions easier and the link to justice system would be those that do drugs and party would lead to o ther things, drugs would lead to running out of money which would lead to theft for money to buy there drugs then would get busted by the police and wind up in jail. many other things could be caused by this ending as a result of being incarcerated also. Hope that gives you a good concept to base your report on.|`|0a6f327caf66b065dfb0752988e904acaa	I agree with Tierney|`|AA10250756	Studies have shown that the children born to under aged unwed teenagers of all races are more likely to do poorly in school and much more likely to end up in jail. They are also more likely to have learning disabilities. There is a link also between unwanted children and crime. There was a famous study that showed that where abortion was available in the US there was a corresponding decrease in crime 15-20 years later. Again, this is across all races. What you should look at is the rates of unwed teenage mothers for all races. Are whites more likely to have an abortion?|`|AA12014149	I agree with L Buchanan

ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	It's from the (fictional) curse of King Tut's Tomb.    Now, there was never REALLY such a curse, the newspapers in the 1920s just started reporting that there was in order to sell more papers, since that sounded more fascinating than true tales of archaeologists preserving wooden statues with wax.

uxvskU7Xaa	to me  3 would be most logic because there may or may not be a god existing - ur right either way because there either is or there isn't|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Number one is the most logical choice.  If you're serious, try researching Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God.    Don't settle for only wikipedia's summary.  Read Anselm.    Any decent public library system should have a book that includes Anselm's writings.    Although I did not come to believe in God because of a logical analysis,  His existence actually holds up under genuine logical analysis.  Read Anselm.|`|AA10747442	Your ultimate goal here is rather muted and this appears to be a question phrased as an intelligent 10 year old would ask !!!

I'm just saying that when you think there can   only be so many possibilities, there could be more.|`|208557bb6eec298af05daee61976e842aa	Number one is somewhat false.  In their private thoughts a lot of church folks may suspect there is no god, but they like church anyway, and it's what they're used to.  We have no idea how many people actually believe in a god, but among educated religious people the belief is not especially fervent I'm sure.  .|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Actually all 3 are true.

All atheists do not have beliefs in gods.  Do you understand the difference?    The answer is choice 3.  However, since there is no way to determine one way or another, what reason is there to believe in any gods?|`|js2OF4Wiaa	none, i hate all of them|`|jnW1hEWJaa	well logic relies on proofs.  There is no proof of a god.  while there certainly is no proof that one doesnt exist in so much as their is no DEFINITIVE proof ANYTHING exists (we only that gravity will be a part of our lives tomorrow because it has been a part of the world as far back as any record shows) using the standards and rationale of our reasoning with what we hold to be true (our accepted theorems about hte way the world works) it is a safe conclusion to say god doesnt exist.    get at me I like talking bout these kinds of things.|`|KUVt2ZFBaa	Logically speaking number three would be the right answer because you couldn't go wrong if you think there may or may not be a God.  I'm not saying that agnostics are right but they do believe in the most logical choice.|`|nT0jiArsaa	1? :o    i think atheist believes God exists, they just don't want to be 'governed' by it, meaning they want to live their own respective lives...    and i've no idea what agnostics folks are. hehe..and i'm too lazy to look in the dictionary.|`|R5MW3BSsaa	3. is probably the most logic anwser, because 1. is false, theres alot of people that go to chruch that don't believe in god! and really theres no such thing as athiest, because I guarntee that they somewhere along the lines question something about god!|`|T8X7mrtHaa	3 is the only logical choice.    It is completely impossible to ever prove or disprove God(s).    You can't infer it, you can't deduce it, and you can't conclusively  demonstrate it either way with evidence.    Agnosticism is the only thing that makes sense: The position that there is not currently enough information for a meaningful conclusion.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`|`|AA10057370	1  I have no problem answering  (something from nothing makes no sense).

I will say that many papers have been "slanted" in their news coverage in the last many years, but they are starting to get more realistic and not so partial to a political agenda.    I also like the fact that I can read the London times and  London Independent and London Tribune.

nRszNpotaa	Yes I'm 100% sure (200% sure regarding the "god" of the Abrahamic faiths). Now could some generic entity exist that you could label "god"...who knows but it matters little b/c if there is such it's not interested in communicating with humans so it's the same as not existing.|`|MGoJ7PPgaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  I'm just a wee human on a tiny blue-green speck of dust in the universe.  To suggest I know everything and know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is absolutely no chance a God could exist is presumptuous, and depending how you present that view to others, arrogant.|`|nADmBWYTaa	Everyone interpretes the term in a different way...<br>  if you ask a priest, he will describe god as-"the one who cannot be ever destroyed, wasn't created- he just exists, in different forms all around us. He is responsible for everything that happens around us.<br>  Ask a physics-expert, he will replace god with "energy", and describe it as "It exists everywhere around us, it can neither be created, nor be destroyed. Nothing in the world ever happens without energy"...<br>  So everything  depends on faith...<br>  according to me, "god" is conscience...or 'just a feeling of confidence"...|`|fNw4wJSGaa	No, I can't say for 100% sure that there is no God.<br>  <br>  Anything is possible. <br>  <br>  It's just highly improbable, given all we know.

Then Einstein's papers of the 1900s would have proved you wrong, and you would have realised the error in giving a certainty of 100%.  Science has learnt its lesson from relativity and quantum theory, and now never gives a certainty of 100% (unless it is rounding up).  There is simply no such thing as 100% certainty, not in this universe, anyway.  <br>  <br>  I'd give my certainty that there is no God in the high 90s, perhaps 98-99%, though it would be perfectly valid to state 99.9999...%|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	Yup.<br>  Actually, I like the Ivory soap version, where I am "99 44/100% Pure", but instead I'll substitute "Sure" for "Pure".<br>  <br>  Peace to you, fellow traveler on planet Earth.|`|JUviY9hoaa	I'm 100% about a lot of things.<br>  <br>  The non-existence of god is one of them...<br>  <br>  And the list goes one.... >:-)<br>  <br>  Lol @ the poster using Adam and Eve as an argument. <br>  <br>  I don't think they understand the point.|`|19PgkkFWaa	im 100.9999999999999999999999999999% sure there is no god or anything that.|`|kuiWXTw9aa	You can't be 100% sure of it, just as you can't be 100% sure that there aren't giant, yellow, invisible bunnies behind you with sharp, pointy teeth and pink eyes.  Everyone's agnostic, from the most religious to the least religious.|`|feBJEgcgaa	Eh, I'm indifferent about there being a deity.<br>  <br>  If there is a God, it obviously has no intervention, no influence. Therefore, if such a thing does exist, it has no effect on our human affairs, which, moreover, is the same as there not being one in the first place.|`|AA11521494	Being 100% sure goes against logic.  You cannot prove a negative.  Unless we are aware of the whole of reality,  there is always a theoretical possibility that god might make himself known.  I grant you, though, he hasn't done yet so 99.9999999999% is more like it.|`|vDr5aROwaa	I am 100% sure that God does exist. All God's claims might be inventions by humans.

wnSvjwWuaa	As lovely as that mathematical equation sounds, I will have to disagree with it. I have met some really rude, obnoxious, stupid, unthinking and uncaring people - who just happen to be gay.    Straight people don't have the monopoly on "how to be a bad human being".    In the end, whether one is gay or straight does not determine how one will conduct him/herself in life.    In statistical terms, it may be correlational, but it's not causal. In other words, a person acting evil is not BECAUSE he is gay or straight.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	I disagree.  Some are good, some are bad.

But remember, as in physical world real life, consent is needed for interactions.     Oh, yea, and be careful of who shows up. Find the definition of a succubus.    If things don't settle when you are finished each time, then you need to stay away from all sex of any kind for a period of 2 or 3 months. Otherwise you increase the problems.

OPFsDMk5aa	You wanna know a fun fact?    Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.  I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.  The evil that men do lives after them;  the good is oft interred with their bones.  So let it be with Caesar.  The noble Brutus had told you Caesar was ambitious  If it were so, it was a grievous fault, and grievously hath Caesar answered it.  Here under leave of Brutus and the rest, for Brutus is an honorable man, so are they all, all honorable men  Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral  He was my friend, faithful and just to me  But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man  He hath brought many captives home to Rome  whose ransoms did the general coffers fill  Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?  When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept  Ambition should be made of sterner stuff!  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious  and Brutus is an honorable man  You all did see that on the Lupercal  I thrice presented him a kingly crown  which he did thrice refuse  Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;  And, sure, he is an honourable man.  I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,  But here I am to speak what I do know.  You all did love him once, not without cause:  What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?  O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,  And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;  My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,  And I must pause till it come back to me.    Mwahaha I had to memorize that for English and I have to present it Tuesday! Pray for me brother! :P    Salam :)|`|2271d7578f9b8099c73f2dadf80821f5aa	yeah perfectly fine.

AA11785185	Well, first, I think you're obsessing about this person you met. You need to take a step back and realize that you may never see him again and be willing to accept that. Perhaps you're in love with the idea of being in love and, so, when you have an awesome first encounter, you're ready to marry him without even knowing anything about him. Just look at how hard you have taken the fact that he hasn't called or emailed or done anything to get in touch with you. So, just chill for a minute. Accept that perhaps he doesn't read Craigslist. Accept that perhaps he may never get in touch with you because he doesn't know how. Accept that he may already be involved with someone. Accept that you may have been more in to him then he was in to you. Accept that there may be a million reasons for his not getting in touch with you and that he may never get in touch with you. Accept these things and move on.    Finally, "T" sounds like he was just trying to joke with you. Just let him know that you didn't appreciate that and it really hurt your feelings. If he is a true friend he will feel sorry that he hurt you and he will apologize for hurting his friend. If he does apologize, accept his apology. He may not have honestly realized that you would have been so serious over such a thing as this. And, you really are being a bit to serious over it, just so you know..    Peace and love...|`|stWGfFeTaa	beat him down to the street top like when the black POlice showin out for white cop    but srsly though, dont beat him up, thats illegal i think. i think its rude and uncalled for and that guy went to far, some people are like that though. just swallow the slight, since ur not good friends and if u have no real continuos relationship with him (do u have 2 see him often), u need to decide if u wanna keep hanging out with him and take the freindship further|`|e08zWhUjaa	OK a tough one P.I.C., but here's the deal.. you have to look at the entire picture here... Yes T was a total A**, yes he is not a true friend and yes you probably should not trust him or count on him to ever have your back.  But if you look at the big picture here.. in a round about way he showed you a side of you that you didn't;t want to see..  The side that became a bit too obsessed too soon, the side of you that really felt a sadness and longing for the decent partner you haven't yet met...the soft guy inside the hard shell exterior that is really looking for that relationship that is full of electricity....  We have all been there.. many times... and it makes us feel a bit defenseless and vulnerable - and when we realize that  in some small  way we have been duped  again - we are a bit depressed and we feel there is a little bit less of us thats un-jaded....    So here it is... its a major lesson.... I think one of the things that took me the longest to learn is how to really know if someone is feeling the same way i do.. I mean they seemed to smile, they laughed at my jokes, they looked into my eyes a lot... they seemed interested to know when they could possibly talk with me again.. etc..    Major lesson - If someone is into you as much as your into them 99.5% of the time they will feel exactly like you do.  Their stomach will flutter a bit if they see you, they will go a bit out of their way to run into you, they will feel a bit nervous and excited when they are around you.. They cant wait to see and talk with you again....they WANT to spend more time with you and get to know all about you....     SO...IF this guy really thinks that you are someone for him.. you WILL see him again.. he WILL find you again.... you can bet on it... if he doesnt then..  im gonna have to say it.. " hes just not that into you"     deal is also, the entire "i cant give you my email " thing is really a major red flag... be careful with it...3 flags and no matter how good you feel about him you walk away..  he may be hiding something.. a BF a wife who knows? and seriously... with hot mail and yahoo.. he could easily have a free email account that could give him aninimity and not risk divuldgeing his person info... Horny single guys are inventive and you think that he cant figure out how to get an email that makes him anonomous until he feels comfortable... somethings not gel- ing.... so be careful...    as for T.. i would tell him that you dont appreciate him having fun at your expense and that going thru this entire charade and decieving you may seem like humorous to him  but it wasnt a kewl thing to do... and in the future you would appreciate him acting more like a friend would.. ( and i still woudnt trust him... he seems like the kind of guy that would hit on someone your interested in.. )     so best of luck.. its it meant to be it surely will happen - dont dwell on it....I hoping the best for you guy...|`|J1XwqvLGaa	Two wrongs don't make a right.

IF they are real christians they will welcome you in , and if they are not you will see pretty quick....BUT you have been among the LDS , you will see if they teach the Truth that the Bible is totally contrary to what you have been taught and the Bible will be the Truth    I suggest you read it for yourself...and pray and Ask God for the Truth of it so you will know who is actually telling you the Truth !!|`|8rbQBaIeaa	I go to church alone.

These churches are usually very good and teach straight from the Bible, which is what we need!  We need to hear God's Word!  Calvary Chapels usually aren't too big or too small either.  They almost always have small groups that you can get plugged into and plenty of people who are ready and waiting to say hello to you.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	I'd suggest going to a friend's church, if you haven't tried that yet. It can make the experience less overwhelming.     Alternately, suck it up and go it alone. That'd be a good way to discover how welcoming they are. Any church would accept a friend of a fellow member, but will they accept some random stranger? If they do, you're good.|`|v7Wflu78aa	You also might consider a Reform Judaism congregation - their outlook on ethics is very engaged with contemporary life.  You will be very welcome there, and being alone is no problem.|`|gHSarVD1aa	This is easy. You know Jesus right?  Well walk right up with him, arm in arm and you will know very quickly if you guys are welcome there.  You know the Bible right?  Listen to what is coming from the pulpit. Does it sound like the same Bible you are reading? Pay attention to how much time they spend in worship, the word of GOD, even announcements. They will usually put time into what is most important to them as a fellowship. Out of the abundance of the heart, the fellowship speaks.    Have fun! There are a lot of awesome fellowships out there. There are also dens of thieves. Run everything by Jesus in careful prayer and this will be an really cool experience.|`|6jAVElX7aa	I went to church alone after being booted out of the United Church, where I knew no one.

Whether you are accepted or not is not the primary issue, the primary issue is that they teach sound doctrine and are involved with some kind of outreach, not just having "social club"...in my opinion, anyway.

I would strongly encourage you to seek out a good Bible or Reformed church and GO!  Lord bless!|`|xkBXhSppaa	It is definitly ok BUT if you are thinking of finding the perfect church for you I suggest you pray about it.

Visit different churches before you decide.  Some have very friendly people and sometimes someone will introduce themself to you and sit with you, and you will meet some wonderful people no matter what the religion.  Don't by shy, have fun.|`|R5MW3BSsaa	ofcourse!|`|Nu6HaIfgaa	1. It's fine to go to church alone. It may seem a little awkward, but honestly, if you are there for God, then nothing else matters. And a church should not make you feel unwelcome. If they do, that's just messed up on their part.       2. In terms of your specific situation, pray about it. If you're at peace with it, then go for it.

The teaching of Christ keeps Him as Judge !!!|`|UCbqpQRKaa	Actually, suicides going to hell is not Biblical.  It is a concept developed by the Roman Catholics concerning Judas when he committed suicide.      I know of a woman who had a daughter-in-law who was suffering from depression.  One night she woke with the urge to pray for her and prayed many hours.  The need to continue to pray was over when she felt an overwhelming sense of peace.  She found out later that at that moment her daughter-in-law killed herself.      There are times and situations where the only peace is in death.  No way will I believe that God would lack compassion and love for such broken-spirited people, especially when it is NOT in the Bible.

Houses make noise, cat's make noise. How can a ghost (something that has no substance) modulate soundwaves to make noise?     2. Everytime some ones shadow walks out of the bathroom from the view in my room under the door, i see another shadow follow afterwards.    Again, how could something with NO substance, block light to make a shadow? Ghosts simply don't make any logical sense.    3. Feeling like stuff is behind me but i look and nothing there.    Wow, I'm convinced. Nothing there you say? Gee, it would'nt happen to be your imagination now would it?    4. Volume on tv going up for no reason, im sure i was not in contact with the remote.

RyhluHk3aa	The reason is that today's dispensation in God's ministering to men, is the dispensation of grace. Salvation offered to the Gentiles, directly by God, without Israel being the channel of blessing.<br>  <br>  The book of Acts chronicles the judgment, and setting aside of Israel for unbelief; the raising up of the apostle Paul by the risen Jesus Christ, and the giving of the Gospel of the Grace of God to him for the NEW church, the Body of Christ; and the beginning of the new church, the Body of Christ.<br>  <br>  Peter was given the mantle of leader of the Kingdom church of the nation Israel, by Christ, in His earthly ministry to Israel. But it is Paul that the RISEN Christ chose to begin, and lead the church, the Body of Christ. The book of Galatians, 2:7 teaches us, "But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) And when James, Cephas (Peter), and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the  circumcision.<br>  <br>  Indeed, the book of Acts actually sees the decrease of Peter's ministry to Jews in Israel, and the increase of Paul's ministry to the Body of Christ, which is both Jew and Gentile.<br>  <br>  Actually, Animation L was correct, although he/she was being sarcastic. The words of the Lord Jesus in the 4 Gospels of the Bible were for ISRAEL only (see Matt.15:24). On the contrary, Paul's words in his epistles IS the word of CHRIST for the Body of Christ today! Galatians 1:11,12 teaches us, "But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but BY THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST."<br>  <br>  And so it is, that Paul writes, and teaches us to "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ".

That's just the way you turned out to be.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Many latinos look a bit asian because American indians originally came to America from Asia crossing ice over the Bering strait|`|6t76bgS3aa	lots of hispanics are part indian and the indians originally came across the land bridge from asia (at least that's what most people think, mormons say they came from israel mainly).  that's probably the reason.|`|636202a5daab42fdc568f4ed6abb39e3aa	maybe there was an asian person in your past--there are asians in central america and just b/c youre heritage is latino doesn't mean you can't have an asian ancestor.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	It's because you do descend from Asian ancestry. What is unique about Hispanics is that you guys are not just one "race", you guys are a make up of N3groid, Caucasoid, and Mongoloid races. Peruvians make up the highest Asian ancestry percentage and Brazilians make up the most black ancestry population, well the highest Black population in the Western Hemisphere. Of course, we should know by now that Native Americans descend from Asians (Eastern) and most Hispanics are a mix with the Native Americans, which is were you get your Asian blood.|`|da4zS4AOaa	ask your creator.

And Latinos have more diversity in that melting pot than a lot of other folks. Most Hispanics have some Spanish ancestry, but a lot also have some American Indian ancestors, too. And the ancestors of those American Indians were originally Asians who migrated over a land bridge that used to exist in the Bering Strait.|`|wZMq5jqyaa	I'm black. and I get asked if i'm half asian all the time.

I look just like my great grandmother who is native american so that's probably the source for me. my sis is half puerto rican and looks asian too. wierd.|`|B2xlWmKXaa	you would look would kind of but you should ask maybe one of your Asian friends?|`|E7FjVzMwaa	If you look cute, consider urself lucky. cause ur different from others.... yay!!!|`|DouFdsjZaa	It must be the high cheek boners|`|agSNDr5Jaa	your ancestors
IxoBFCpTaa	Yusufali and Hilali-Khan are generally used as the best english translations.    Hilali-Khan uses today's english and many parentheses to make the translation and meaning of the verses more clear.     After these two, come Shakir and Pickthali translation. This site contains three translations:  http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/...

I have read many translations, but the one that I use most is of "Rashad Khalifa". It has its plus which many others lack a lot.    1-  It is in EASY to understand and modern english.  2-  Does not sway out of context.  3-  Compared to all others it is quite honest.    ----  However, just FOLLOW the rules of reading the book, and hopefully the translator will not be able to fool you.    The rules are given within the Quran: Some of the very important ones are:    1-  IT is COMPLETE.  2-  There are "NO" contradictions within it.  3-  One verse explains the other.    Also:    4-  The ONLY teacher of the Quran is God Alone.  5-  Nothing abrogates it.  6-  Keep away from ANY references that are outside the book i.e. it is complete.    -----|`|AA10248239	Either Abdullah Yusuf Ali or Muhammad MarmedukePickthall.    By the way, you can get a lovely English translation of the Holy Quran free from the Saudi Embassy or Consulate.

agwxFmITaa	Swany is right - people are only allowed to keep ￡16,000.00 in the UK.  My Mum went into care and Dad paid all her expenses then he went into care and so the savings they had left paid for both until we had to sell their house (no-one was living in it so it was considered an asset).  When Dad dies, his ￡16,000.00 went across to Mum, who was still in-care and it was used to pay her care home fees.  All in all,I would say the government got close on half a million pounds from my parents.  Mum @ ￡2,500 a month for seven years.  Dad @ ￡3,500 for over five years.  My Dad was in business, a good saver, and paid 50% income tax for a good part of his life.  I will tell you one thing - this will not be happening to me!|`|wmBK9uASaa	I think it depends on how much money they have....|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Where we live they do.

le9ZROs5aa	Everywhere! I love to shop it's like a sport and I'm an all-star. LOL! I dunno I never had the fear of shopping even when I was in my genderqueer phase before transition I didn't hesitate to ask to try something on in a womens store. Yeah a couple of times I got a weird look or snarky comment but oh well it's their problem not mine. Screw'em Spooky it's their problem not yours.|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	i shop at walmart, target, salvation army, marshals, and my local mall.|`|uG3lPB9xaa	i'm MtF but the situation is pretty much the same....   i buy my apparel just about anywhere where i can get clothes i like, basically (from stores to ebay)... it did help me that i "had to" buy clothes for my best friend sometimes and thats really when i started buying stuff for myself too... i still feel nervous about it though, no matter how many times i've done it ^^     i can see your problem with the measuring up, i wouldnt like that either... i'm not out yet and i dont openly dress as a woman (... not usually and not too obviously)...     well i guess most people just think i'm buying things for my gf (which is the most likely thing)...     since i usually know quite well what i want i dont bother much with salespeople, so i usually just tell them i'm fine if they ask (just look confident and they probably wont) ...     oh, and as far as i see it you've got the advantage that most of society doesnt really care if a woman is wearing male clothes ;) ...so not even those older italian men should complain? women in suits are sexy! ... yeah i know thats not you but why would they care about your motives? you'd buy their products (probably not cheap) and it sounds like the kind of store that would care about every single (regular) customer|`|3OZgcntfaa	Wow, just today this was running through my mind as well. I was at the mall with Lunchbox (who is terrible to shop for clothes with on the best of days) and after about 20 minutes and three stores I gave up buying clothes. It was just terrible.    I get really frustrated about clothes too. Which is why if I seriously need to get new clothes, I take my mother or father along with me for moral (and financial, hehe) support.    It sounds really childish I'm sure. But I know that when I am with my mother in a store people just see a mother shopping for clothes with her son, and don't even notice that her son is a little hunched over himself (to hide what little chest mass he has) or if they notice they chalk it up to a teenage thing. My father is authoritative enough in appearance that no one even approaches us because dude walks like he owns the store, even if he's never been there before.    I guess what my solution to clothing anxiety boils down to is to pick someone (ironically not your partner) to be a clothing buddy. Someone you know gets why it's such a pain for you to buy clothes who can be there to suggest things in your style and to keep the sales associates from getting in your space.    My father was great at my first suit fitting. I had binded for the occasion, and the tailor went to get at my waistline. Dad was in on my shirt so fast (to keep it from getting raised to the point where you could see my terrible Tensor job) I think the tailor got whiplash. The guy had not a clue he was fitting a transman with a suit. He thought I was some teenager... since he suggested to not alter the arms of the suit so I could "grow into" the length...    My favorite place has been Stitches for a long time... but they discontinued my style of jean this season... so I might have to find a new place to shop...|`|28yMpUfSaa	About evenly divided between thrift stores, the clearance racks of department stores, and if there's one thing I need, the other sections of department stores.

They are normal people who have a physical need for extra energy because they don't have enough of their own to stay healthy. Sanguines drink small amounts of blood from willing donors, and psychic vampires pull the energy directly from their donors. They are not mental, and they don't have medical conditions like Porphyria. The only reason they use the word "vampire" is because it is the closest word that fits their condition. They don't sleep in coffins, they aren't immortal, and the worst that they get from the sun is a burn.   http://www.sanguinarius.org/  http://www.drinkdeeplyanddream.com/  http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/  http://vampirewebsite.net/   http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm|`|egBy7RqOaa	yes they are real.  it is a proven fact that vampires are real. evidence: i am one.    vampires arent your typical story book characters though.  we dont burst into flames in the sun-or sparkle, we dont tun humans into vamps by biting them-we exchange blood, we dont sleep in coffins-in beds, we eat normal people food-along with occassional blood, we can control our thirst, and theres alot more. if you have questions email me and i will answer you.     best answer?|`|anfhcnWeaa	we are real but we are not like we are made out to be in movies and books we dont actually suck blood in the sense that we do not bite people and turn them into vampires. vampires are born not made, there are two major types of vampire there is the sanguine they drink blood from donors or animal blood such as pigs or cows from butcher shops and then there are psychic vampires we draw energy straight from donors or nature (trees, plants, T-storms, Ocean,etc)We vampires are not monsters we are people just like you. we use the word Vampire because it is the closest thing to what we are.|`|9oMo4Ic6aa	no but i so wish that because i love vampires 2 because of twilight|`|dwu1b36xaa	No, but even if they were real it wouldn't be the same as the twilight vampires.

vGbTKA2Haa	Karma Number (7)    "You are dealing with the karma of failing to fully develop spiritually in a past life. Your lesson for this lifetime is to develop your faith, or your spirituality. You will probably start off the life with a doubting and questioning approach to spiritual matters, and then have to develop insight and belief as you grow older."      "Number 7s can improve their karma by extending a helping hand to those they would normally consider to be contemptible in behavior. 7's can also create good karma by learning to master their greatest fears such as fear of abandonment and fear of "letting go."

wwdllMzYaa	a legit disabiality is one you have<br>  thats it<br>  the only requirment is to actully HAVE a disability<br>  if the government and some individuals need more than you actualyl having one,they are the ones being unresonable<br>  <br>  we dont really do court hre unless its the 2nd or 3rd appeal<br>  or soemthing like that<br>  but id probably just wear a nice skirt or trousers with a nice shirt <br>  nothign too fancy, but not too casual either<br>  just trousers and shirt, dark colours, browns, blacks, blues|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I would wear a nice sweater and slacks and non-sneaker shoes if you have them. Otherwise, wear what you have. The criteria for SSI or SSDI is if you are able to work at a job and earn about $800 a month, then you are not disabled enough.  I'll give you my disability blurb I wrote up mostly for mental disabilities (I have bipolar) but there may be stuff in there that can help you, especially about that book from Nolo Press.<br>  ***<br>  You should contact your county social services offices & see what help may be available. In the meantime, if you desperately need money to live, I know in my area, a guy needed SSI, & a local church plus general welfare helped pay his bills until the social workers could get his SSI paperwork thru. He had schizophrenia, I think. The mental health problem has to be very severe, or if you have another condition like low vision or hearing loss, the two disabilities together may be very severe. You have to be unable to work at ANY job where you could earn about $800 a month or more. So if you can flip burgers, or bag groceries, you don't qualify. Some states have a program you pay into while you work that will pay for short term disability . I know California had that kind of program. I am pretty sure that Massachusetts does too. You can look at pay stubs & see if there is some state plan you have been paying into. Your employer may have been offering short term & long term disability. Long term disability covers mental illnesses only 2 years, usually (discrimination) but that will get you over to SSI/SSA.<br>  <br>  Get the book "Social Security Disability" from Nolo Press, at nolo.com, and read their online information, or see if you can get the book at your library (maybe even through an interlibrary loan?) It will give you a lot of background on how to apply, what criteria are used, & how to fill out the forms. <br>  <br>  You have to be PROFOUNDLY disabled to get disability, & if you are relatively young & educated, it will be harder. But if you really can't hold down a job (e.g. You can't handle the stress of even showing up to work, you can't behave appropriately much of the time, etc.), & you can document that somehow, you should get it eventually. You will almost certainly be rejected the first time, & the process takes awhile, so somehow you have to manage your finances in the meantime.  You may need to hire a lawyer.<br>  <br>  Once you go on disability, you will never get off of it, no one does. You will be in poverty the rest of your life unless you marry out of it or a miracle cures you. The ways the rules are make you dependent on the system, so keep that in mind when you are deciding if you want to do this. A lot of people have no choice, because they can't work at all, or they can't keep a job with insurance to get their pills. It's humiliating in America to have no job-people always ask when you are being introduced,"Oh hello, what do YOU do for a living?" which ends up being a very nosy question without meaning to. Especially since many people do not consider a mental illness to be a bona fide illness. They may think you are a malingerer.  If you can get supportive help from social services (in my state, they will pay for support groups & a social worker to visit & help with paperwork) or tweak your meds some more, or from a local consumer group (google the words consumer, mental, & your state. Consumer=person getting mental health services) then maybe you won't have to go on disability.<br>  <br>  I'm on SSA myself, & need the Medicare, so I'm not being judgmental, I just want you to know what you're getting into. For me, there was no other way. I know a lot of people in the same boat. Get the book I recommended, it will give you all the legal & inside information to see if you qualify.<br>  <br>  All the best to you! I hope you feel better soon!|`|s2aCNJOBaa	Me and my only child ARE legitimate medically-legally recognized Disabled PWDs at the local, state, and federal levels and by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Both me and my child got our Supplemental Security Income (SSI) on our FIRST try without going to a courtroom hearing.<br>  <br>  For a courtroom hearing, I would wear a nice formal outfit like clothes that you would wear on an office job or at church. It is not every day that you go in front of a judge and as you know, things are very formal in a courtroom.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To me a "legitimate Disability" is that the Disability IS proven by medical documentation AND/OR by educational documentation AND is recognized by the State AND/OR Federal government.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You claim to be a PWD and you have stated that your Disabilities are MILD. I DO believe in what you have said. I realize that you and me have different viewpoints on whether you are actually Disabled or not. But the PWD Community intensely dislikes the fact that if a person that is NOT actually a PWD and is NOT Disabled and gets Supplemental Security Income (SSI) then the PWD Community see this as actually abusing and misusing the Social Security Administration (SSA).|`|grZLOA2Qaa	Wear clean, conservative, well-maintained clothing. No need to dress-up. <br>  <br>  You told us you weren't legit when you said you said your disability was mild. I got my disability on the second try. Two tries is very common, three or more is not.
z5GwTXx6aa	Yes, I have spoken in many different wards. Especially after serving a mission.**|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	It can happen, but it's not common.  Generally it only happens with returning missionaries or people with stake callings.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Oh yes. You can even be asked to talk in another stake. There was a sister in my ward who was asked to talk at another Stake Relief Society's Women's Conference.|`|b9f2e3a8dc363f474dc664216e1823b1aa	if a high counselor asks you to join him in another ward.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Yes.  Returned missionaries are often asked to speak in other wards, singles attending family wards are sometimes asked to speak, and at least where I live, people who speak Spanish are often asked to speak in the Spanish branch.  It doesn't usually happen to anyone not in those categories unless one of the local wards is really tiny and finding speakers is a problem, though.  Bishoprics are supposed to find speakers from within their own ward if possible.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	why not, I was a nonmormon and talked at my mom's funeral to my old ward that I use to go to when I was LDS. I am now christian and my atheist brother was allowed to talk at my mom's funeral in her ward as well.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	This would be very unusual.  About the only time I can see this happening is at Stake Conference or if you have a unique compelling testimony.  In a typical ward, it is hard to include everyone.  With testimony  meetings, dry counsel Sunday, holidays and conferences there are only about 50 spots a year.  In 5 years I have only been asked to talk twice in my ward.  It is possible that someone with a musical talent, however, would be asked to perform in another ward.|`|snAtqVG9aa	it can happen if you are member of the church it doesn't matter|`|AA12383652	Yes  Its up to the discretion of the Bishopric, for the most part, who is asked to speak.|`|AA10254101	Yes you can be asked. In my ward we have had people from our stake talk in our ward and people out of our stake talk. For an example we have had institute/seminary teachers, temple presidents, come and talk, we have returned missionaries come in and so much more.     On fathers day a couple of years ago my aunt was asked to talk about my grandfather in his ward.

So, then, since you don't think that's what they had in mind, should we kick all ethnicities out? Why does what the founding fathers would think really matter all that much?|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Obviously they did, since they authorized the importation of millions of black slaves!    Also, this country was found off of the nation of "Religious Freedom", so from the start people of different religions and beliefs started to come here.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	Who cares what they think.

Maybe he is searching and just says he's an atheist because he feels he is not yet sure.  Help him to understand.|`|KiLGNvLeaa	I believe that faith works better by example.  So by your example perhaps your friend will find God.  It is very hard for some people to trust what is unseen,unheard, untouchable.

It's easy to put all your trust and "faith" in an invisible sky daddy, but realizing that you have to make it in this life on your own will is a little scary. I still wouldn't chose a delusion over reality. Reality may be harsh, but it has many perks.|`|RJECt4zFaa	Yes.  I can learn a lot from this.  Regret.  What a concept.  It's like feeling bad about something that you could have prevented.  Well I guess it's not like that, it is that.  Does that answer you question.|`|v9103JO5aa	What!!!!|`|szeFBYDmaa	A link to the question you are referring would have been appreciated.    Atheists hope to be wrong. If we are wrong then we continue after death, great... Unfortunately the logic we use to manipulate and observe the world makes us think we are right.    I don't know if I would call this regret though. Its more envy that we don't feel that we go anywhere when we die. We don't have that comfort. But we pride ourselves as realists.|`|JCXNRvdJaa	faith or not having faith is very personal and commentig on this, unless the person is himself interested or it requires open debate in public interest, doesnt appear to be in confirmity with individual rights. so please allow your friend some breathing space.|`|CyslkJdEaa	God has helped to 'guide' my life in that I've had some really awful things happen to me (child, adolescent, molestation, being burned by hot grease in my youth, seeing a close family member die of complications from AIDS, then losing my dad the following year in almost the 'extact' same way, etc.), but I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I didn't have God in my life, I'd very truly have cracked up a very long time ago.  My faith in God and my family and friends (and much prayer) keep me grounded and 'He' keeps me sane.    I ask that you not take this as a put down or a belittling, but I say from the bottom of my heart and my soul (even for those who believe humans don't have one), I really don't know how people live without believing in God (I've gone the non-believing and other routes as well, but they just don't work for me.), because even when I just believed in 'thing's' I felt that I was missing out on something, and like there was a hole inside that needed to be filled up, and He did that for me.    Lastly, "True Christianity", is 'beyond' a feeling.  It's not even a 'word' that I could ever describe to you, and I'm being as serious as I know how. There are times when I want to weep especially when I think of all the things that God and Jesus went through for me, and how they've loved me through it all.    My heart goes out to you in your bitter and loney state (and please be aware of the fact that sometimes we have fears and doubts as well, but when I think about what awaits me, us, those vanish into nothingness.), and I pray that before you lay down to breath your last on this earth, that 'you' will come to know beyond anything that 'you' can ever imagine that there is a God of all gods, and His Son Jesus who want to end your bitter and lonely state and welcome you into their family if you will let them.  I apologize for this very very long letter.  May God open up the windows of your heart and mind, and set 'you' aside so that you can 'know' Him (them) for yourself.
AA11707728	It's only a month.  People get weirded out if you act too invested too soon.  Also, men hate....and I mean HATE doing things like the helicopter thing or going out to an event.  They will go but it's not the same for him as it is for you.    Here's what to do.  Take him shopping at the grocery store.  Buy the ingredients for a special meal together.  Go home and cook it together.  Some candles, a nice meal, lots of ******* afterward.  This reinforces and builds your bonding as a couple.  It's the type of thing that people who are together (as opposed to just dating) do.

It is haraam to do this or have it done by choice. Similarly, plucking or removing hair from the face is also haraam, whether one does it or asks someone else to do it for one, unless a woman has a beard or moustache, in which case it is not haraam to remove it. Widening the gap between the teeth is done by filing between the incisors. This is done by old women to give the appearance of youth and make the teeth look beautiful, because this attractive gap between the teeth is characteristic of young girls. When a woman gets old, her teeth get big and look ugly, so she may file them to make them look more attractive and give the impression that she is younger It is haraam to do this or have it done by another, because of this hadeeth, and because it involves changing what Allaah has created, and is a form of deception and falsehood. Widening the gap between the teeth is something that is done to make a person look beautiful, which indicates that what is haraam is when this is done in the pursuit of beauty, but if it were done as a form of treatment because of some problem or deformity in the teeth, then there is nothing wrong with it. And Allaah knows best.

Tn1bMQ3Aaa	If you want understand him based on the usage of "died" and "passed away".. well this is what I know..<br>  When someone first looses a loved one they usually will use the words passed away.. After time and after accepting the loss, I notice people tend to use died. <br>  <br>  So in trying to answer your question about the person.. I would say he has come to accept the death of his father. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't try to determine how close he may have been to someone that has died.

6tHA0QQXaa	because they are usually british and not really African|`|UspK4SQBaa	There are several languages spoken in South Africa, so it stands to reason that the accents would vary as well.|`|T42Nt3Lyaa	The accents sound different since English is not their mother tongue. Afrikaans is the home langauge of the Afrikaaners and coloureds and is closely related to Dutch, whereas the Blacks mother tongues are indiginous langauges such as Xhosa and Zulu.    The true South African English accent is that spoken by white South Africans of British decent.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Mainly because most black people's mother tongue is an indigenous language (Swahili, Xhosa, Zulu, Tswana, Setswana), but most white people's mother tongue in South Africa is English and Afrikaans, so it will sound a lot different. Think about it, have you ever learned a foreign language? You probably sounded alot different than somebody who was a native speaker of it!    It could also be where in South Africa they came from. Even though South Africa is not that large of a country, they do have a lot of regional dialects. For example, somebody from Durban would sound different than somebody from Bloemfontein, or somebody from Jo'Burg would sound different than somebody from Cape Town. (Just like how somebody from the American South has a different accent than somebody from Los Angeles)    Hope this helps    EDIT: Girl under me, most Afrikaners are of Dutch ancestry, they are known as "Boers", but some whites in South Africa have British and Italian ancestry.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	When it comes down to it all, the White South Africans are of European decent (mainly Dutch) because they conquered Africa and were known as the Boers when they did. I believe it is because it is a mix between European and African dialects.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Because South Africa is a big hodgepodge of ethnic groups and there are many languages spoken there. The blacks have an accent like many natives in other areas of Africa because their first language may be something like Swahili. Many white South Africans are Afrikaners who speak Afrikaans which is a language that is close to Dutch, (the Afrikaners, or Boers, are a group descended from the Dutch settlers who came to Africa). Because of that they speak English with a different accent. Aside from the Afrikaners, there are also the English who speak with yet another accent.|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	i think the apartheid created different accents since the two races were separate so they each created their own community and developed a whole new accent within their community     but i would love to go to South Africa though :)

iWaU76T5aa	Uh lol @ the person putting white last, I have seen Indian guys in the US with White girls the MOST, but still a lot of Asian girls (Japanese and Korean) I have talked to say that out of looks, they would pick an Indian guy over a White guy only if Indian guys were more enthusiastic and chased after them as much as White guys do. So GO GET HER PLAYA if you like Asian girls.    Here is my ordering from most to least likely    1. Asian - Most Chinese and Korean people in the US live in neighborhoods with a lot of Indians. Indians are Asian as well so they understand each other. Plus both Indian and other Asian races have smart kids who excel in school and understand each other well. This is your best shot and be happy it is, Asian girls are freaking gorgeous and do not throw a lot of tempers.    2. White - White women (most up north) are extremely Liberal when it comes to relationships. They prefer character over skin color unless you try to get a trailer park trash. Most Indian guys in the US end up with White women when it comes to interracial relationships because White women are more likely to not shy away and make you chase them.    3. Black - believe it or not, Black people are extremely friendly with interracial relationships. "Guess Who?" was nothing more than a comedy movie, we do not care about race as others may think, just that Black women are less likely to come in contact with Indian men. When they do a relationship is possible, Black girls who work themselves to a good college are one of the NICEST girls you will ever meet.    4. Hispanic - Ok, sorry to break the news and I am sorry if you are attracted to girls of this race but it will NOT happen. I am saying this right now do not even try for it, just keep your cool and chase after other races. These type of girls either go with Black men (the ghetto latinas that is) or White men (other latinas) but never Asian and if they do it is NEVER Indian, NEVER. It is something about their tastes, soooo yea sorry to break it to you, I mean if you really want to try out one of these get a hooker in the south Bronx or Spanish Harlem and get a taste lol!      BUT in the end,     Some girls like Asian guys, some like White, some like Black and some like Hispanic guys but in the end all girls have one thing in common    every girl loves a successful man, so try being one, and if do truly become MR NFL Quarterback, it is going to be raining cats (Girls will chase after you, get an umbrella!)|`|fqMWBsjGaa	I'm guessing asian since your background is asian.|`|da4zS4AOaa	I'll arrange them in order. People you might have a chance with    Asian  Hispanic  Black  White|`|VsamHLPOaa	A girl who meets you and decide that she likes you. I have a feeling that you'll change your mind on the whole not marrying an Indian girl.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Asian, but once she finds out that you have issues with your own ethnicity, you'll probably lose your chance there too.

bda465ikaa	The royal families of Europe are intermarried to the point that all the living monarchs in Europe, plus some of the deposed monarchies are all descendants of John William Friso who died young in 1714 and only had two children.  ----  Famously George V of UK in World War I was first cousins with the emperor of Germany and the Tsar of Russia when they went to war.  -------  However, the royals are not really as inbred as is commonly believed. The Hapsburgs in Spain were extremely inbred however the British royalty was not that bad. The first cousin marriages ended in the 19th century. In contrast, almost 20% of the marriages in the world are first cousin marriages. Almost 50% of the Pakistani immigrant community in UK has a first cousin marriage.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Defiantly, the royal family's are quite closely related.     Queen Victoria married off her children into most of the royal families of europe to stop all European wars, obviously this failed.     In WWI the Kings of Germany and The UK were cousins.    There is also the common Anti-Royalist argument that the UKs monarchy isn't even British, as The Queen having strong German Heritage and her Husband coming from the Royal family of Denmark and Greece.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Yes. Prince Phillip the queen consort of Britain is a Greek/Danish prince.  Queen Margarethe of Denmark is half Swedish.  Tzarina Maria Feodorovna was born princess Dagmar of Denmark.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Ummmm. Yeah.  It's why the royal families often died out...because the only people good enough to marry a royal was another royal.  In short time, the gene pool became quite shallow, and they were all marrying first cousins.      And, just btw...I don't think Galicia ever had a king...It's just a region in Poland.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Yes.  Royalty has always married other royalty.  Almost all of the Queens of England up until the 20th century were foreigners for instance, mostly French or Spanish, or in the 18th and 19th centuries German.  Very rarely did an English king marry an Englishwoman.  King Edward IV married an Englishwoman, Elizabeth Woodville, and King Henry VIII married Englishwomen as four of his six wives.  But they were unusual.|`|N7CJSTr1aa	Oh yes, defiantly.|`|241a517cc8a625c9b4b9fe2419fcfe10aa	Yes there was. Queen Victoria's family were known as the Stud Farm of Europe for that reason. However, it caused numerous genetic problems, hemophilia for example, and we now have a Royal Family that is a genetic cocktail of Irish/German/Danish/Russian/Greek/ Scottish descendants.
MtZZTDqhaa	Here's a blog posting I wrote on this very subject.  It's too long to post all the content as an answer here, but here are some quick highlights.  There may be some useful info for you. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://artoptics.blogspot.com/2008/06/abrahams-family-feud.html" rel="nofollow">http://artoptics.blogspot.com/2008/06/ab...</a><br>  <br>  1. They are mono-theistic (ie: belief in one true God)<br>  <br>  2. They are Abrahamic (ie: they trace their roots to Abraham.) Jews and Christian’s trace their lineage back to Isaac, Abraham’s eventual son with his wife Sarah and Muslims trace back to Ishmael, Abraham’s son with Sarah’s Egyptian handmaid - Hagar.<br>  <br>  3. Islam is the youngest of the three faiths. Muhammad was born about 500 years after Jesus and taught that Jesus was not God incarnate but was a great prophet just like the Jewish prophets of Moses, Jacob, Elijah, Jonah, and David. <br>  <br>  4. The Qur’an retells many Jewish Old Testament Bible stories (although in some cases with different details) plus additional revelations that Muhammad said he received from the Angel Gabriel that were to correct distortions to God's message made by the Jews and Christians. <br>  <br>  5. Islam is predominately a theocracy which believes the ideal is to have an “Islamic State” in which there are no freedoms (religious or political) outside the Islamic culture. Whereas a central theme in Judaism is the celebration of their freedom and liberation from the tyranny of their Egyptian captivity. Yes, Israel is the world's only "Jewish State" but mainly in the sense that it is a safe haven for Jews from persecution. It is a modern democracy with freedom of religion as a legal right. Likewise in Christianity, Jesus was concerned only about people and not at all about cultures or politics.<br>  <br>  6. To Muslims God is highly feared and is not personal - there is no concept of grace. He waits in paradise with a scale to weigh your good deeds with your bad and only if you have done more good can you go to paradise. Muslims are never certain of their salvation except if they are martyred defending it – that is the only guarantee that you would go to paradise. Muhammad himself was unsure of his own salvation.  Jesus on the other hand regularly assured people that whoever believes in him shall be saved – that it is a free gift from God and not by works alone so that people can’t boast about how "good they are" to get into heaven.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	They all persecute other groups under the guise of sharing their love or wisdom|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	They all claim to be followers of the God of Abraham.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	They're from same origin.They accept the same prophets.They believe in resurrection and hereafter.They believe in angels.|`|9onFys4baa	Islam and Christianity are plagiarisms of Judaism.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	History shows that at one time or another, they all tried to dominate the world and they all failed.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Belief in the same supreme God<br>  Belief in heaven and hell<br>  Belief in the devil<br>  Belief in angels<br>  Belief in the patriarchs of the Hebrew Bible - Abraham, Moses, etc.<br>  Belief that Adam was the first man<br>  Belief in the final judgement and resurrection<br>  Belief in helping others and doing what is right|`|L8h9EHkeaa	The biggest similarity amongst Christianity, Judaism, and Islam is that they are all monotheistic (meaning they believe in one god).<br>  <br>  Another similarity is that they all believe in an afterlife.<br>  <br>  All three religions believe that they can communicate (perhaps not directly) in some way with their God (through prayer).<br>  <br>  All three religions believe Israel is a holy place.<br>  <br>  They all have sacred religious texts:<br>  -Judaism: The Torah<br>  -Islam: The Koran<br>  -Christianity: The Bible|`|naGtKdN6aa	- Judaism teaches the idea of a single indivisible God, but rejects Jesus, the virgin born messiah.<br>  <br>  - Christianity modifies the original Judaic monotheism to make room for a "trinity" and accepts Jesus, the virgin born messiah.<br>  <br>  - Islam teaches the absolute monotheism as seen in Judaism and at the same time accepts Jesus, the virgin born messiah.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  @Jesus is Lord(The user below me)<br>  <br>  The Jews dont believe that Jesus is God either.

But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.  [3:19]<br>  <br>  “Chosen for you ISLAM as your religion”<br>  (Radeetu lakumu alISLAMa deenan)<br>  <br>  O ye who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month, nor of the animals brought for sacrifice, nor the garlands that mark out such animals, nor the people resorting to the sacred house, seeking of the bounty and good pleasure of their Lord. But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb, ye may hunt and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancour: fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment.  [5:2]  Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah. that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you ISLAM as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, Allah is indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.  [5:3]<br>  <br>  “Submit then your wills to Him in ISLAM”<br>  (Falahu aslimoo)<br>  <br>  To every people did We appoint rites (of sacrifice), that they might celebrate the name of Allah over the sustenance He gave them from animals (fit for food). But your Allah is One Allah. Submit then your wills to Him (in ISLAM): and give thou the good news to those who humble themselves,-  [22:34] <br>  <br>  The Source of Peace<br>  Alssalamu<br>  <br>  Allah is He, than Whom there is no other Allah;- the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace (and Perfection), the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver of Safety, the Exalted in Might, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory to Allah. (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him.  [59:23] <br>  <br>  It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in ISLAM) to Allah's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law<br>  Inna anzalna alttawrata feeha hudan wanoorun yahkumu biha alnnabiyyoona allatheena aslamoo lillatheena hadoo waalrrabbaniyyoona waalahbaru<br>  <br>  It was We who revealed the law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in ISLAM) to Allah's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's book, and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers.  [5:44]  We ordained therein for them: "Life for life, eye for eye, nose or nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal." But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for himself. And if any fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (No better than) wrong-doers. [5:45]  And in their footsteps We sent Jesus the son of Mary, confirming the Law that had come before him: We sent him the Gospel: therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the Law that had come before him: a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah. [5:46]  Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath revealed, they are (no better than) those who rebel. [5:47]  <br>  <br>  If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message<br>  fain aslamoo faqadi ihtadaw wain tawallaw fainnama AAalayka albalaghu<br>  <br>  So if they dispute with thee, say: "I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me." And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: "Do ye (also) submit yourselves?" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah's sight are (all) His servants.

RC5RAzykaa	Bethel means "house of God"<br>  <br>  Peniel means "facing God" and it was the place named by Jacob when he wrestled with God and located on the north bank of the Jabbok close to the Jordan<br>  <br>  Jacob was renamed Israel, for Jacob means "the deceiver" and after wrestling with God (who was pre-incarnate Jesus by the way) and wrestling with the sin in his life, he came to repentance, and took hold of the blessing of God, and became Israel which means "God prevails"  because God won the wrestling match, and Jacob allowed God to prevail in his own life, removing him from his deceit, and freeing him from slavery to sin, for Jacob up to this point had done much evil.<br>  <br>  It would appear that you have answered the other questions sufficiently for yourself.<br>  <br>  The ladder also typifies Christ, and the angels moving upon it were bringing prayers up to God, and coming down with blessings from God.

Their heritage was forgotten as God promised. The northern tribes became the "Keltoi", often referred to as "Celts". In bands they flourished throughout Europe becoming often the dominant people of the areas they conquered. The tradition of taking an enemy's head was translated with them, and they took the traditions of their homeland with them. The current traditions are evidence of this, the bagpipes, the "Kelt", the harp, all originated from the people they once were in the Middle East.

rv2Iy1Y7aa	Summary:  <br>  <br>  The passage identifies Daphne, her father (Peneus) and Apollo.  It tells of how Apollo fell in love with Daphne.  Daphne runs from Apollo and she is turned into a tree (a laural) which becomes sacred to Apollo.
MbaP0u6iaa	An English (or Scottish or Northern Irish) knight is entitled to call himself, and be called, "Sir Firstname Surname", and his wife is "Lady Surname". This title is not hereditary; it is conferred by the monarch in recognition of some personal merit. (There are baronets, who are in effect hereditary knights, but they are always referred to as "baronets" not knights.)<br>  <br>  Baron is the lowest rank of the British peerage. It used always to be a hereditary rank, although in the 20th century non-hereditary "life peerages" have been created. Until 1999, the crucial thing about the British peerage was that all lords (provided they were adult, and neither in prison or a lunatic asylum) were entitled to sit in the House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, and vote. In that year the Lords were reformed by Act of Parliament and only 92 of the hereditary peers are still members of the House of Lords.<br>  <br>  A Baron is, funnily enough, never addressed or referred to as "Baron" - he is called either "Lord Surname" or "Lord Placename". His wife is "Lady Surname" or "Lady Placename", and his children are "the Honourable Mr Surname" and "the Honourable Miss Surname".|`|abaf923a34ee9c58296df504faad9d74aa	It depends on how much they have given to the corrupt government.

Certain savants, especially autistic savants have extraordinary abilities. For example a guy in Britain, Daniel Tammet, who is a high-functioning autistic savant gifted with a facility for mathematical and natural language learning.     Tammet claims to speak eleven languages including English, French, Finnish, German, Spanish, Lithuanian, Romanian, Estonian, Icelandic, Welsh, and Esperanto.    He particularly likes Estonian, because it is rich in vowels. Tammet (the surname is Estonian) is creating a new language called M?nti. M?nti has many features related to Finnish and Estonian, both of which are Finno-Ugric languages. Some sources credit Tammet as creating the Uusisuom and Lapsi languages as well.    Tammet is capable of learning new languages very quickly. To prove this for a Channel Four documentary, Tammet was challenged to learn Icelandic in one week. Seven days later he appeared on Icelandic television conversing in Icelandic, with his Icelandic language instructor saying it was "not human" and "genius!". Segments of the interview showing Tammet responding to questions in Icelandic were televised on the 28 January 2007 edition of the CBS news magazine, 60 Minutes. He also appeared in a Discovery Channel documentary, Brainman, along the guy whom Rain Man was based, Kim Peek.

You think of her needs and she thinks of yours (in the best situation).     Worse or dangerous? You're coming from a position that it's somehow bad to have intercourse or to pleasure yourself. Weakens the mind? Only if you let it take up too much room in your life. That is the nature of addiction. If you can function well, and still have a girlfriend, go to work, meet with friends and family, pay bills and assume your responsabilities, then where is the problem?    Neither one is bad if it still permits you to live a balanced life. The question is, does it?    Best regards,    A*
HMfQjKpsaa	Accepting Jesus is a reference to completely believing and dedicating your life to Him and His teachings, Jesus also being God (trinity).

However, I do accept that Jesus did exist, this is a well documented fact, it's just that I don't believe him to be the son of god to any greater extent than the rest of the population.  Much of the contents of the bible are documenting the history of the time rather than describing a religious principle, this I have no problems with.  Anyway, isn't Jesus supposed to have said that we're all sons of god?  Many of his teachings are common sense and the same can be said of the ten commandments, they're good principles to live by regardless of your beliefs or lack of.  However, the bible is written by people, not by god and I have my own beliefs which are not a part of any religion but more based on my own feelings and experiences.  I believe that the 'truth' of this reality is very different from the way it's described in any doctrine.

It clearly states in the Bible when Jesus is speaking "I am the way, the truth, and the life.

I know you said that they weren't taking it seriously, but you need to try again. If that doesn't work, speak to your doctor by yourself. Call his office and have him call you back. You can also try your school counselor again. It's really sad that no one is taking this seriously. You clearly have a good head on your shoulders.

Just because a rule does not compliment your way of life, does not mean it must be false, you are just clearly searching for reason and excuses to carry on living the way you are.    And suicide bombers...they're not practicing Islam right in that sense, because Islam teaches to not even let your words hurt a man. So clearly, they have misinterpreted and done wrong. Suicide is one of the worst sins in Islam.|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim    Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah.    There is much confusion in what you are writing.  First of all, hadiths were not "made 200+ years after the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him).  The hadiths were preserved verbally and in many cases by writing by the Companions of the Prophet, and the manner of gathering them was done with the most rigorous scholarship.      The reason it is not permissible for an unrelated man and a woman to be alone together is that Satan is the third, and there will be a temptation between them to possible commit a sin up to and including fornication.  Islam is keen to protect men and women from this sin.  It is not forbidden to be out in public with a woman, but you must both be observing proper ettiquette and not be indecent in your manner.      The main restriction on men regarding hairstyles is that men should not wear their hair in the manner of women and they should not seek to emulate the non-Muslims.  If you have a haircut like a mohawk or other distinctive cut that you did to resemble a famous person, then it is better to cut it off or let it grow out.      Don't be afraid or put off by the teachings of Islam.  Approach it with the "Big Picture".  The most important lesson is Tauheed, belief in the Oneness of Allah.  If you start from there, you can continue to learn and bit by bit you will come to appreciate the teachings of Islam and to love to live according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him.  The first duty for you is to start praying.  The daily discipline of prayer will help you build a foundation for learning and taking on the lessons of Islam in a gradual fashion.    Suicide bombers, well, they are off the chart.  Truly, the ugly sins they commit are horrible and Allah will judge them harshly for undermining the true teachings of Islam.  Why do those Muslims let us down?  Because they do not understand Islam, and they allow themselves to be "hijacked" by sick twisted individuals who teach them foolishness.  They are not your responsibility - Allah will deal with them on the Day of Judgment.    Whatever you do, PLEASE don't do a mullet hairstyle, lol.  That would be too much to bear! :)    Fi Aman Allah,     Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|xuZ2y3ADaa	say wallahee u noe what im sayin cool.|`|GM0kOZpRaa	Im sorry but I dont know the answer.

65QqZBnjaa	I'm with Spooky, you don't sound serious.    First, "sex change" is a term that minimizes the long, expensive process that TRANSITION is.  My transition took 4.5 years and $80,000.    Second, the first step is seeing a gender therapist:    http://www.DrBecky.com/therapists.html      A couple information sites for trans men:    http://www.TheTransitionalMale.com    http://www.FtMguide.org    http://www.Transster.com      Also know the bottom surgery options for the guys isn't that good.      Are you ready to possibly be:    Rejected by family?    Shunned by friends?    Excommunicated by your church?    Lose your job just because your trans?    Being denied medical care?    Being denied medical insurance?    Being denied housing?      If so you may actually be ready to transition.      One more link:    http://www.Susans.org Click "Forums", then "Transsexual Talk" and the FtM section is right on top.    That's an on-line support forum where you can ask other trans men questions.      If you're serious....

OK|`|WwCVhlGbaa	dont do it just be a lesbian or bi  Is Really freaky when your transgendered!|`|AA12006309	This question doesn't sound too serious, but I'll answer it anyways.    There's plenty of resources out there for people who want to transition from female to male.  Sadly the surgical options are lacking a bit, as the scars from top surgery tend to be pretty major, and the results from genital surgery tend to be a bit under par.    If you want to transition, there's plenty of options available that don't involve surgery.  Breast binding can help flatten your chest to pass as more masculine, as well as shifting your clothing from female to men's wear.  You can purchase artificial "packers" (a fake penis and testicle set) that you can wear in your pants to give the appearance of a bulge and shift your walking gait.    I've placed a few links below that might be of some help.  Good luck.|`|K3RzcMRTaa	no lesbianism is awesome :]|`|ArS9av0Eaa	I don't think u r being serious about this, lol, u r kidding right?|`|xbjc2yzOaa	uhm sureeeeeee.....if you want to be lonely for the rest of ur life|`|U1gLSkafaa	really if girls found out that you were once a girl they would say that they didn't like you anymore. think like this"You were born a girl"  and your family might disappointed and on the other hand that would be wierd!!  im just gonna tell you like a friend "dont do it"

My grandmother was 85 when she died and her death had nothing to do with smoking, so nope sorry your logic is flawed, not to say that smoking isn't harm full or one of the worst things anyone could do but it's not suicide.|`|a8kAassWaa	The Bible never directly mentions smoking. There are a couple of principles, however, that definitely apply to smoking. First, the Bible commands us to not allow our bodies to become "mastered" by anything. "Everything is permissible for me - but not everything is beneficial. Everything is permissible for me - but I will not be mastered by anything" (1 Corinthians 6:12). Smoking is undeniably strongly addictive. Later in the same passage we are told, "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body" (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Smoking is undoubtedly very bad for your health. Smoking has been proven to damage the lungs and the heart.    Can smoking be considered "beneficial" (1 Corinthians 6:12)? Can it be said that smoking is truly honoring God with your body (1 Corinthians 6:20)? Can a person honestly smoke "for the glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31)? We believe that the answer to these three question is a resounding "no." As a result, we believe that smoking is a sin, and therefore should not be practiced by followers of Jesus Christ.    Some argue against this view by pointing to the fact that many people eat unhealthy foods, which can be just as addicting and just as bad for the body. As an example, many people are so helplessly addicted to caffeine that they cannot function without their first cup of coffee in the morning. While this is true, how does that make smoking right? It is our contention that Christians should avoid gluttony and excessively unhealthy eating. Yes, Christians are often hypocritical by condemning one sin and allowing another, but again, this does not make smoking honoring to God.    Another argument against this view of smoking is that many godly men have been smokers, such as the famous British preacher C.H. Spurgeon. Again, we do not believe this argument holds any weight. We believe Spurgeon was wrong for smoking. Was he otherwise a godly man and fantastic teacher of God's Word? Absolutely! Does that make all of his actions and habits honoring to God? No.    In stating that smoking is a sin, we are not stating that all smokers are unsaved. There are many true believers in Jesus Christ who smoke. Smoking does not prevent a person from being saved. Nor does it cause a person to lose salvation. Smoking is no less forgivable than any other sin, whether for a person becoming a Christian, or a Christian confessing his/her sin to God (1 John 1:9). At the same time, we firmly believe that smoking is a sin that should be forsaken and, with Gods help, overcome.|`|iNn9mmOtaa	pst: it's not what goes in the mouth that defiles man, but what comes out the mouth from the heart: Job 15:6...

Acts 17:24,?25: The God that made the world and all the things in it .?.?. gives to all persons life and breath and all things.    The evidence that cigarettes shorten life is overwhelming; the causal connection is as firmly established as any in medicine.Science 80, September/October, p. 42.    Reports show that in the United States the annual death toll from smoking has been tabulated as being 300,000; in Britain, 50,000; in Canada, 50,000. More than one million people die annually because of smoking-related disease and the Third World, which accounts for 52% of world tobacco consumption, is making up a rapidly increasing proportion of those deaths.The Journal (Toronto), September?1, 1983, p. 16.    Former U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Joseph Califano, said: Today there can be no doubt that smoking is truly slow-motion suicide.Scholastic Science World, March?20, 1980, p. 13.    It is not consistent with what God requires Christians to render to him    Rom. 12:1: I entreat you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason.    The surgeon general of the United States, C. Everett Koop, said: Cigarette smoking is clearly identified as the chief preventable cause of death in our society. (The New York Times, February 23,?1982, p. A1) Medical studies show that .?.?. the average life expectancy of a smoker is three to four years less than that of a nonsmoker. The life expectancy of a heavy smokera person who smokes two or more packages of cigarettes a daymay be as much as eight years shorter than that of a nonsmoker. (The World Book Encyclopedia, 1984, Vol. 17, p. 430) Is it proper for a person to present his life for service to God and then slowly to destroy that life?    Smoking is so devastating, especially to the heart and lungs, that the other aspects of preventive medicine become comparatively insignificant if the person smokes. (University of Southern California News Service, February?18, 1982) Smoking is probably the largest single preventable cause of ill health in the world. (Dr. H. Mahler, director-general of the World Health Organization, in World Health, February/March 1980, p. 3) Is it consistent for a person to present himself to God for sacred service and then deliberately to ruin his health?    Smoking is a violation of the divine requirement that we love our neighbor    Jas. 2:8: You must love your neighbor as yourself.Compare Matthew 7:12.    A recent study .?.?. revealed that the nonsmoking wives of men who smoke die on the average four years younger than women whose husbands are also nonsmokers. (The New York Times, November 22,?1978, p. C5) Smoking during pregnancy can cause congenital malformations so severe that either the fetus dies, or the infant does shortly after birth. (Family Health, May 1979, p. 8) Such unloving treatment of family members is clear evidence that a person is not acting as a Christian.Compare 1?Timothy 5:8.    Studies have shown that since the average smoker actively smokes his cigarette for only a small portion of the time it is lit, a nonsmoker may actually be forced against his will to breathe almost as much carbon monoxide, tar and nicotine as the active smoker sitting next to him. (Todays Health, April 1972, p. 39) A person who is thus unloving toward his fellowman does not give evidence of loving God either.See 1?John 4:20.|`|ffleo5hHaa	it may be a form of long time suicide but even a person who pulls a trigger to their head and kills themselves won't go to hell.

PviIOflqaa	To an American ear, the sentence is a little bit strange.  It doesn't sound completely wrong, but it does sound awkward.<br>  <br>  The adverbial clause "when you adventure with friends" isn't awkward so much as it's unfamiliar.  We rarely use "adventure" as a verb.<br>  <br>  The main clause is awkward.  <br>  <br>  On the one hand, it's in passive voice.  The clause doesn't mention who is having fun.  It's the same structure as "Food is eaten."  We don't know who is meant to have the fun any more than we know who is meant to eat the food.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it's paired with an adverbial clause that does make the subject explicit.  When you adventure with friends, "you" are the one doing the adventuring.<br>  <br>  A somewhat simpler version of the same idea is this:<br>  <br>  "You have fun whenever you go out with friends."<br>  <br>  Now the verb in the main clause is in active voice, the subject of both clauses is the same, and the unusual verb is replaced with a more common idiom.  By replacing "when" with "whenever", we manage to preserve the idea of timeless consequence that was initially introduced by the passive voice structure.|`|T6v3RWixaa	Fun is when you have adventure with friends.<br>  <br>  This means that when you go out with friends (whether to a party, to a movie, to camping or mountain climbing, etc.), you enjoy what you are doing, having a great time, doing something that fills you with joy and laughter.|`|jhdpLhNcaa	I think the "Had" is not needed in the sentence!|`|xdFMwpr7aa	Fun is easy to be had if you had adventure with your friends.

18be83adf26491424d29aa61ef0530d6aa	Many family members feel they have a 'right' to an 'inheritance'.  This is a belief that has been popularized by certain long-term insurance plans and financial planners.  A 'legacy', while a nice gift, is just that 'a gift'.<br>  <br>  I assume you did nothing to help your mother earn this money?  She probably helped you many times.<br>  <br>  When she closed her eyes, or if she's alive -- at night when she sleeps, she had/has peace about what she did.<br>  <br>  Again, this term 'legacy' and 'inheritance' is sometimes no more than greed and a feeling of 'right to entitlement' which is selfish.  Perhaps the charity helped her when you weren't around to help.<br>  <br>  Think of the good things she did in life, and the love she probably had for you.  That is all a parent owes us.<br>  <br>  In closing, I hear you 'honored' her, but did not hear how much you loved her.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	why don't you look at it that she left you anything - she didn't have to leave you a dime. if she left 80% to charity and 20% to you then apparently she didn't leave anything to her other children!!!|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	not be mad over it<br>  <br>  you were in a lot of trouble which may have had some thing to do with it.<br>  <br>  forgive her and move on.<br>  <br>  nothing can be done about it now.<br>  <br>  it was her money to do with as she pleased.<br>  <br>  to hold a grudge over your mother after she is dead.<br>  I assume by your post she has died.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	The root of all evil is the love of money.<br>  <br>  You are the poster child for that verse.|`|oDR80CiSaa	If she left 80% to charity and 20% to you, obviously your other siblings didn't get anything.<br>  <br>  Also remember, love of money is the root of all evil.<br>  <br>  Is this what all children know now? Ungratefulness? Your parents do not owe you your living, neither do they owe you money, your life, or anything else. They brought you up, clothed and fed you, sent you to school, paid your school fees, and most of all, LOVED you unconditionally, and yet you complain about her not leaving you enough money? Is it your right to demand money like this? No. It is your mother's right to do what she wants with her life and assets.<br>  <br>  In short, YOU OWE THEM.<br>  <br>  You've owed them for every single second since the day you were born, and what you owe them you never can repay (and honestly if you're thinking about repayment in this situation you're extremely calculative and not worthy of getting even that 20%).<br>  <br>  Honestly, what kind of values you must have...

n1MZefbqaa	Vas de vaciones por dos meses y luego ni te comunicas conmigo y despues regresas y me haces esperar por dos semanas y decides querer verme? En una relacion de "amigos con beneficios" seria acceptable.  Si hubieras sido mas considerable lo que paso el sabado por lo noche nunca hubiera pasado.  Y solo para dejar las cosas en claro, el muchacho que me beso es HOMOSEXUAL. No importa, porque yo habia asumido que habiamos terminado porque ya no habia escuchado de ti en mucho tiempo.<br>  <br>  Sacate la cabeza del culo.  Parece que no tienes la abilidad de ponerte en mis zapatos.  Siempre prefieres tener la razon (aunque solo sea en tu opinion) embez de ser feliz.  Que fea cualidad tienes.  Me das lastima. Si no cambias, te moriras siendo un hombre feo, viejo, y arrugado.|`|BO28Mn8haa	Te vas de vacaciones por dos mesos y no tratas de contactarme y despues vienes a casa y pasan dos semanas antes que decides que quieres verme. Si fuera una relacion de "amigos con beneficios", eso fuero aceptable. Si tu fueras mas considerado, los eventos de la noche de Sabado no huvieran pasado. Yo todavia estaba, y todavia estoy, dolida por tus acsiones. Y para que lo sepas, el muchacho que me beso es gay. Tan si quiera, yo estaba abajo la imprecion que habiamos terminado porque no a sabido de ti en tanto tiempo.<br>  Sacate la cabeza de el culo. Pareses que no tienes la abilidad que ponerte en mis zapatos. Prefieres ser correct (el menos en tu opinion) que ser feliz. Que calidad tan fea. Que triste para ti. Si no cambias, vas a morir un hombre viejo solitario.|`|ikacAw7Naa	This is the translation.  Word for word. :<br>  <br>  Tu vas a las vacaciones por 2 meses y no intentastes contactarme y vuelvo a casa y tuve que esperar 2 semanas antes de que tu decidites volver a verme. Si tuvieranos una relacion de “amigos con beneficios” puede que seria aceptable. Si tu hubieras sido más considerado de los acontecimientos de la noche de sábado no habrían ocurrido. Era y todavía estoy decepcionada y lastimada por tus acciones. Y para que sepas, ese individuo que me besó es GAY. Cueste lo que cueste, estaba de la opinión que habias acabado conmigo puesto que no había oído de ti en mucho tiempo. Saca tu cabeza de tu culo!  Ponte en mi lugar. Tu prefieres tener razón (por lo menos en tu opinión) en lugar de ser feliz. Una calidad fea que es. Eso es muy triste para ti. Si tu no cambias, vas a morir un hombre viejo y solo.|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Way too much to translate hun!|`|268fbadb7ead2c9b7c16ca2a28b85c7baa	Te vas de vacaciones por dos meses y ni siquiera intentas contactarme y luego regresas a casa y esperas otras dos semanas antes de decidirte a verme de nuevo. En una relacion de amigos con derechos eso es aceptable. Si hubieras sido mas considerada (o), lo que paso el sabado no hubiera pasado. Estaba y estoy muy desepcionado y herida (o) por tus acciones. Y por cierto, ese chavo que me beso es HOMOSEXUAL. Yo pensaba que tu habias terminado conmigo, digo, no me habias hablado en mucho tiempo.<br>  Salte de ****. Pareciera que no eres capaz de enfrentar quien eres. En mi opinion, parece como que prefieres estar en lo correcto que estar feliz. Que mal. Eso es patetico. Si no cambias, terminaras muriendo solo y viejo.|`|w3plOs6uaa	Está de vacaciones durante 2 meses y no intente ponerse en contacto conmigo y luego regresar a casa y esperar 2 semanas antes de que usted decide que quiere verme. En un "amigos con beneficios", relación que sería aceptable. Si usted ha sido más considerado de los acontecimientos del sábado por la noche no hubiera tenido lugar. Y todavía me siento decepcionado y herido por sus acciones. Y para que conste, que ese chico es GAY me besó. A pesar de todo, yo era de la opinión de que habían terminado conmigo desde que yo no había oído hablar de usted en tanto tiempo.<br>  Haga que su cabeza fuera de su culo. Parece que carecen de la capacidad de ponerse en mis zapatos. Usted prefiere que se la derecha (al menos en su opinión), en lugar de ser feliz. Qué feo es que la calidad. ?Qué triste para usted. Si no cambia, se muere un anciano muy solo.

diCASlUXaa	Yes.  Of course it is.  Most people don't know at first.  I didn't know until I was 18.|`|PEvWgIkVaa	If your gay you usually feel Something when your around the same gender as you.|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	its quite possible. i suppose that i fit in to that category|`|a7IAkpJtaa	sometime you gay but you dont know until you actually love the same sex. therefor you start to know. but it ok to being gay.
F3CMtEcraa	What you need to do is just relax and let it be.  Bi/gay/straight, whatev. Labels are so 2008, anyway. You can drive yourself insane fighting internal batles like this if you feel you have to. But the best idea is to remain open to anything, and if a guy or a girl comes along and you wind up falling in love, then great for you.  I really hope that'll happen for you. But stick around that girl that you like if you want to, you never know what could happen.  If it's nothing, just move along.  You don't HAVE TO be all figured out and stuff.  Just chill, k? ;)|`|shPIoenzaa	Well, since you're young, you could just be bi-curious. You could end up being with a girl and not liking it, or if you do, I guess you would be bisexual.|`|1nV16XyTaa	Remember that it could be a phase,just a very long phase haha.  or are there reasons you cant see yourself with them guys?    I have the same problem atm.  I know for a fact im bi and everyone has told me so.  Ive actually only just posted a Q about it,  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  if thats any help.    either way,dont label yourself just be happy with who you are.|`|oJNYLa8Iaa	Hmm;     See, this is why I sometimes wish we wouldn't have labels for our sexualities.    I'm a girl and it's sort of the same way for me.  I'm very, very attracted to guys.  But there's been a few girls who I can see myself with.  It's very confusingg..  I want to say I'm bisexual but idk.  Just don't put a label on your sexuality, I guess.|`|diCASlUXaa	Yes.

CEChcfKwaa	I remember my mother telling me when she was young her family was traveling and they stopped in this tiny town in Arkansas to get gas. My mom and grandma were walking around, stretching their legs when they passed this trashy looking laundromat. Painted on the glass door in white letters were the words "White Only". This was in 1980, not that long ago really.    My mother told me seeing those words and the look on my grandma's face scared her. They left that town fast and didn't stop again until they were well out of that state.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	I can't even imagine|`|2gyJUTzRaa	how ironic...50 years later we have a black president and the jews own everything.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	Wow, really? That's really sad when you think about it, but it makes me happy to know that someone fought in order for the future generations (such as myself) to not have to endure that. It's really interesting, but it sucks that it had to happen that way.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	The federal Fair Housing Laws have done away with discrimination against humans because of their ethnic background. Restricting against animals is legal.  Thank you for the reminder: there are so many young users on here saying "why can't everybody just get over racism." The reason we mustn't forget racism is that there are US citizens whose childhood and adulthood were cheated because of legal racism. People who had to sleep in cars when they were 6 years old; people who had to walk past the school bus stop. Institutional racism is not ancient history, it is the recent past.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Some hose deeds had a clause making the buyer promise never to sell the house to a non-white person as well.    Ah how times have changed!|`|RJtP0XDjaa	wow. i would have peed on that sign. hardcore!
H41u0B8Jaa	Accidently left your friend where....out of the invitation to go skiing?  If he doesn't ski and you told him to watch your webcast what's the problem...you wouldn't have invited him to go if he doesn't ski.  Your question is unclear.|`|1JSblCBsaa	accdiently left them?  what, like Home Alone?      get them a book deal out of it|`|4wnPK7Uaaa	ur a bad friend
TpVE6ci6aa	They work, but they usually don't live for very long (few months at most). I had them once and one of them got to about 3cm or 4cm long. You usually have a fair few hatch at the start but they slowly start dropping dead one by one until they're all gone. The same with Sea Monkeys. I guess it's hard to make it sustainable. :/|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	yeah! They're pretty cool, actually. Just be sure to follow the instructions accurately. Put them in a spherical goldfish bowl for magnification. They'll eat each other, so in a month or so, you'll be down to three or four, but they'll be an inch long!|`|qv0tr0fqaa	Yes but don't put orange juice in their containers then they grow really really big and have fangs i had too and thei were like rlly tiny but then my bff told me tht ojuice makes em healthy and i was like "O RLY?" and he was like "YA RLY!" and so i dropped ojice in their and thei started running around rlly big and scary and i was like wtf and i ran and so yeah dont do it.    I mean it.|`|f9dnldJraa	Yeah, I bought some a couple of years ago as a gift for a young sibling.  He actually grew them and they grew to be pretty large. They are not like those sea monkeys that I hear you cant even see. These however are not very colorfull and have a grayish silver appearance like those silver fish (the ones that eat clothes and paper). They grow to be about the size of a nickel. They grow pretty quick and I think the sibling wound up flushing them becouse he was scared about their rate of growth. I recall that they had large antane and some sort of legs/tenticals. He flushed them becouse he was frightned that they would one day crawl out and try to kill him. Im not sure if that was even possible but their tenticals looked like they could support their weight. (oh and one did go missing but I think the others ate him)
oTPfxusYaa	hablador       parlanchin      cotorra      mas que jode      lengua larga|`|JTkFxYxfaa	Well, I usually use the words "loro" (parrot) or "cotorra" (magpie) for that kind of people.|`|VpLrhh4laa	Speedy con Lingua|`|f1d91712a330b8eb3c10ad153ee02b26aa	hablador is probably the most widely used term for this type of person. It's the one I've always heard.    If they gossip in the process then you call them either chismoso (from the word chisme which means gossi0 or metichie (from the verb meter - to insert into) which basically means a person that always has to insert something - like they know it all.

dfcCoGwRaa	"The tragedy of the magician"   "La tragedia del mago"    "March fifth"  "il cinque marzo"    "I love you"  "Ti amo" (to a boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse)  "Ti voglio bene" (to family)    "Ti voglio bene" technically means "I want good for you", but it's basically a less strong way than "ti amo" of saying "I love you" used when speaking to family.  ________________    Although this is common in English I don't think that's very common in Italy, but it would basically just be..    "I love you ____ (Jeremy)"  "Ti amo, Jeremy"    Again, more commonly I think it would just be "ti amo", and the other person will obviously know it's to them if you're saying it to them.|`|GOk8dWAUaa	1) la tragedia del mago  2) il cinque di marzo  3) ti amo|`|UpfxhYETaa	1) La tragedia del mago  2) il cinque Marzo  3) ti amo / ti voglio bene (use the former if the sentiment is deep and serious; use the latter if you only have a mild affection for the person to whom you're saying it)    "Ti amo, Jeremy" or "Ti voglio bene, Jeremy" (either, in accordance with the distinction I wrote about above).|`|8p5F0gTUaa	go to i google translator.|`|Nzqa98ghaa	Hi,    1) the magician's tragedy -or- the tragedy of the magician  la tragedia del mago    2) march fifth (in words not numbers)  cinque marzo    3) i love you  ti amo|`|Q8JeA1eNaa	1) la tragedia del mango  2)il quinto del marzo  3)Ti amo|`|bLahP9Ivaa	1)la tragedia del mago    2) il quinto del marzo    3) ti amo|`|Cp6ACouDaa	Ti Amo = I love you.........
AA12006309	While not specifically transgender, you can always give to the ACLU - the American Civil Liberties Union.  The Human Rights Campaign does work regarding LGBT issues, and is very active.  There is also the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Lambda Legal and the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.  PFLAG also has a section set aside for transgender persons called TNET.    Sadly there's very few specifically "transgender" charities out there, but they tend to fall under the LGB umbrella.  My personal choice would be to the Human Rights Campaign.|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	i dont think they exist.|`|28yMpUfSaa	I suggest looking for local support groups, advocacy groups, and clinics.    Spooky:    The Human Rights For Some But Not For Others Campaign is way too transphobic to consider.|`|AA10406650	normally trans-gender women are segregated from general population for their own safety. If there is any mistreatment going on it would be coming from other TG girls. If you were legally given hormones before being placed in prison in most cases you will be allowed to continue on with your hormone treatments and be allowed to see a psychologist. If for some reason these things aren't provided you have the right to file a grievence against the prison, with the courts. Other than talking with a lawyer I don't believe there is any help provided to you?

7hpXsYOCaa	Id say "Hurry up throw me in Hell, don't wanna miss the party!"|`|5AbCtkWFaa	What really horrible things?  Nothing I've said can be as cruel, as vicious, or as mean-spirited as the rhetoric spewing from the yaps of people claiming to be Christians.  I give you the Phelps brigade as a prime example of really horrible things.  If there is a heaven--and that's a pretty big if--I sincerely hope that whoever is in charge will look at how people lived their lives and let in nonbelievers who have tried to live morally and ethically over believers who spewed poison. <br>  <br>  Oh, and apostrophes--use them.  It's "don't".  You might also want to take care of that run-on sentence there.  And correcting the punctuation of someone who should know better is not horrible.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Are you perchance referring to Atheists?<br>  <br>  No prostration here!<br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically punish them.<br>  <br>  What type of parent would eternally refuse to acknowledge their child or kick them out of heaven -- I mean the parents' house -- for disobedience or refusing to pledge their fealty to mom and dad? Ever hear of unconditional love? Does the g-d of Abraham possess that quality? If so, he would still let people into heaven even if they refused to acknowledge Jesus.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	I'll play along with this "what if" scenario<br>  <br>  IF there is a god they would most likely ask me why I've always said "I don't believe there is a god, but if I'm wrong and there is one I hate the F*cker" <br>  <br>  I'd answer by stating "You made me to be a logical and analytical person, therefore you would have known that I wouldn't believe unless there was proof, if you wanted me to believe you should have proven yourself, therefore by default you set me up to fail didn't you?" <br>  <br>  I like this game :D  What would you say if you die and find out that there is no god only a period of purgatory like being prior to reincarnation? You'll feel like a dope wouldn't ya?<br>  <br>  I'd rather feel stupid for not believing in something that isn't tangible than to feel stupid for believing in a fairy tale|`|c4cafeb95e50c5fbcb03f6ef804f7e3caa	I'd ask him why he allows over one million children a year to starve to death in the world. I'd ask him why he allows almost one billion people in the world to live in absolute poverty.I'd ask him why he allows millions of children and women to be raped and tortured...I'd ask him why people over the age of 5 use the word "wanna".|`|kLPOFIOpaa	Probably be breaking down in tears and begging.<br>  <br>  Also,<br>  "If you died and went to heaven ..what would you say to your maker before he troughs you into hell for all the really horrible things you said?"<br>  <br>  I don't reember saying any really horrible things.

Hmmm.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyhow, if somehow God were to call me on the carpet (so to speak) to chastise me before punishing me for all eternity for acting solely on the evidence I had available to me - then I would demand that He account for His own actions.<br>  <br>  To whit:  Tricking His own creation into the apparently heinous sin of gaining sentience, and then punishing them for it.  For starters.<br>  <br>  Genocide against that creation with a giant flood, killing millions of innocent babies at a minimum - not to mention the millions or billions of innocent puppies and kitties and bunnies that weren't on the ark.<br>  <br>  Torturing His own son for three days - apparently so He could forgive His creation for that heinous gaining of sentience.<br>  <br>  If He couldn't explain those horrific acts, then I would certainly see to it that He faced a class action suit for criminal negligence, gross misconduct, and child abandonment.<br>  <br>  No matter how He answered, there'd still be a suit for his incredible design incompetence that allows people to choke to death on their food because the respiratory and digestive tracts overlap, not to mention the millions who have died in painful childbirth because of His horrible design of a narrow, bipedal pelvis combined with an enlarged infant cranium.

If a god exists, I can't imagine that he'd condemn someone to everlasting hell for being honest, kind, a good person, and for using the brain that this god supposedly gave him.

OKegTV8baa	People who speak 2 languages or more and feel confident speaking them can do that.  Sometimes the thing is that you just forget the word you need to say in Spanish and you unconsciously change to English and viceversa. It has happened to me many times.  Also, when we are talking to a person and we know he speaks both languages we could do it, because we know he wont fell offended.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Sometimes the exact word comes to you in the other language faster.     Not just Spanish, but all languages.  My mom used to do it all the time with Yiddish.  Wait!  She still does!|`|oTPfxusYaa	Well people that switch from spanish to english, they're talking in spanglish. Spanglish refers to the code-switching of "English" and "Spanish", in the speech of the Hispanic population of the United States, who are exposed to both Spanish and English. So to say people that speak spanish switch from english to spanish is incorrect. Because this phenomenon is only seen in the United States and not in the spanish speaking countries of the world.     Speech of a fully bilingual Spanish and English speaker in the U.S. who spontaneously switches between Spanish and English usages in mid-sentence, linguistically is someone very different from a monolingual Puerto Rican Spanish speaker whose native vocabulary contains many English words and expressions.|`|vpL67nETaa	My boyfriend and I do it all the time.  It's called code-switching.  People refer to it as spanish and  that is INCORRECT. Spanglish is when words from english are transformed or copied exactly into the spanish language.  For example, the cooks at my restaurant would call the freezer "El freezer." That's not spanish, that's spanglish.  Code-switching is switching from one language to another within the realms of a sentence or conversation.  (My professor in college has her masters in spanish and in english and has written studies about it , we all had to do huge research papers on the phenomenon of spanglish)      To answer your question, it's just how it comes out sometimes.  Especially since he's trying to learn english so when I know that I'm about to say something he has the capacity to understand, I'll switch.    Also sometimes, the thing you are trying to say comes out easier in another language (usually your mother tongue).  Especially if there's an expression you want to use that doesn't translate over directly in that language.|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	It is not only with Spanish but any language.  I speak 4 languages and when I am with a group that speaks any or all of the languages, I switch back and forth.  Sometimes it is just easy to express oneself in a certain language.  It is not pre-planned  or anything like that, it just happens.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Lots of bilingual people do it. When I was a kid, I used to listen to my neighbor on the phone talking to his cousin. The conversation was 80% Polish and 20% English. It was all mixed together. To me, it was fascinating.|`|bcb934cd4176c6117c3cbd9a6a0357c9aa	Sometimes we do it because sometimes you don't remember how to say a word in either language and that's our escape valve.|`|MDyV9HKJaa	most people who speak a second language do that. i speak arabic so i switch back and forth between language out of habit or because it's easier to describe things|`|4MffVLX8aa	Haha, I do this a lot randomly   Sometimes things just sound cooler in other languages, so it's more fun to say it in Spanish|`|rGgAVeDQaa	There are people who do not speak one language or the other.  I first heard this mixed language called Texican.  Nowadays I hear it called Spanglish.  Also, there are many English words that have no Spanish translation.  For example, garage.  If you speak Spanish and are going to talk about the garage, what are you going to do?  Say garage, of course.  No problemo.|`|358cbae440ce92123d3d9003e4a471dbaa	My boyfriend (from Mexico) very simply says    "because we can"    LOL ;)|`|RcB2FNWRaa	They wouldn't be the only ones...    Many people who feel comfortable speaking two or more languages may often switch between languages, even in the middle of a sentence, if they're talking to someone else who also speaks and understands those languages.  This is known as 'code switching', and it is extremely common.  It can occur for several reasons, such as due to not knowing a particular word or phrase in one language, or if they believe the person they're speaking to may not understand certain things in one of the languages.    So that's the reason above; but it will not always seem "random", as there may be patterns of use for certain speakers - or maybe not.  For just about every language I've heard being spoken around me, I've heard people code switch.

MzHwklzKaa	For every "catty" comment she makes, you make a positive one.

OR  "Maybe we should see if she's feeling OK, maybe her health is failing".  OR  "Yeah, I'm going to ask her to go for a walk with me at lunch today".

tlUihEOvaa	Yes I understand media does make an impact on some peoples' views. But then the media isn't the truth of the world or reality we live in. Those who control the media just want to send a message or look for ways to make themselves $$$.     I don't care if many Asian women are going out with White men, they aren't my family or anything. Besides women don't belong to men, a man and woman belong with each other.     I do agree that the media tends to choose a lot of mixed people, maybe for their "exotic" features. Also Asians are only 4% of the U.S. compared to Blacks who are 13%.     Also what's the "fully Asian" look? I mean if an Asian didn't have small slanted eyes then that would make them not full Asian? Jw what you meant by that.|`|GPznIhzMaa	First, look at the stats. The black community is larger than the Asian population in the U.S. (That is, if I'm correct to assume that you're talking about the U.S.) Second, there ARE a lot of mixed-Asians in mainstream media and pop culture. Just to name a few: Kristin Kreuk, Kelis, Jessica Gomes, Nigel Barker, Ben Kingsley, Keanu Reeves, Rob Schneider, Lindsay Price, Tia Carrere, and Mark-Paul Gosselaar.|`|xPWs1FAlaa	I got an idea, you should go have sex with an "asian" man then create half "asian" babies.

Perhaps there are mosre than you think,it could be that they take more gene from their white side,and not as many from their asian side. A good frend of mine was half filipino,but she had blonde hair because her mom was white,most people didn't belive she was asian.|`|uLdmXx3faa	Because people are more obessed with black folk than with asians.  There are more asian/white couples than there are black/white couples. And yet black men get more of the heat for dating white women when stastics show that asian women are more likely to date outside their race.    Edit:  Actually, I think that they cast mixed black women and mixed asian guys more because they're features aren't aparently attractive. Asian women and black men are exlcuded from this of course.|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	in my opinion i think its because asians are a little more conservative and just prefer that asians date other asians while blacks just go with about anything but their own    but date and marriage are two totally different things|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Do you really think that the media is a good representation of the world? The media is also notoriously bad about choosing bi-racial people mixed with black over fully black people. And *when* they do show Asians (which isn't very often), they will choose full Asians for the parts.    The most common interracial relationship in this country is white man/Asian woman.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial...

Most of the ones I can think of are full.|`|iqoShLwlaa	I'm half asian half samoan   xD  I was on the news too|`|AA12018110	Maybe it's because there's difference between dating, sex and marriage?

The same can go for white women and black men.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	I agree with Rory4Eva, you seem to be on a roll today regarding race.  Why the fascination?  Well, as someone who has lived in California, Illinois and Florida, I can attest that there are plenty of biracial children whose parents consist of someone of Asian descent.  No, they are not readily shown through the media or represented as are not the masses of invisible biracial children nationwide.  They are some of the worlds most gorgeous looking children so its really a shame.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Why does this matter?  One of my close friends is White/Asian.

7i9ncEBdaa	Being bisexual or lesbian makes no difference. Do all straight people eventually pick a member of the opposite sex and settle down? No. It's not the orientation, it's the person. Some bisexuals and lesbians, yeah, some no. Some'll pick a guy, some'll pick a girl, some may never settle down. Now quit being a homophobe and supporting stereotypes.|`|TLOgBy3caa	Yes...  They're still human beings..  It depends on what they want in a life partner...  Do all straight people want to eventually settle down? Or am I just gonna see a bunch of straight grannies and grandads running around?  I refuse to be tied down to a man, I will, however, give my life to a girl.  Not everyone is a whorse.|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	I think it's kind of ignorant that you seem to think the only way to settle down is with a man.  I will settle down with the right person when I find HER.|`|CNSGz12zaa	Some do, just like anyone else they are each different.|`|0QAyPPeoaa	my neighbors are gay|`|nQiLLqGeaa	Too many people try to define their sexuality at too young of an age. Only when have fully matured (around 25 or so), do they really settle down into a distinct sexuality. Teens are confused, experimental, hormonally deranged children in the bodies of adults, humping everything that holds still long enough. I don't think it's fair to call bisexuality a "fad," but if all the other 9th grade girls talk about experimenting with other girls, people tend to want to try it for themselves.    After age 24 or 25 though, people typically know what they are. I can guarantee you that most "bisexuals" in their teens end up being gay or straight. There is only a small percentage of people who are TRULY bisexual.    There are lots of middle-aged and older women who live together. There are entire websites, books, and communities dedicated to lesbian mothers (mombians).     Gay people aren't promiscuous lunatics bent on having as many partners as they possibly can. I'm a freshman in college - and I'm not looking for random flings. I want a long term relationship.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	50/50 chance.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	You sound anxious.

We girls don't become lesbians. We struggle with it internally for a lifetime wondering why we aren't wired to like the opposite sex. And here you are making it sound like sexuality is a trend. It's not a trend. It's who we are. I think every girl will stand by me when I say WE ARE NOT TRYING ON SHOES, OUR SEXUALITY IS WITH US AND IT DOESN'T RUN SKIN DEEP, IT'S TO THE BONE.|`|zl2cBCj0aa	Yeahh Lesbian grannies!!! x)  nice.. I am bisexual and I cant say what gender will I end up with.... Cause that isnt important..|`|u04pBBq3aa	I seriously throught the same thing but all i know is I want to fall in love and settle down too and maybe have some kids with a girl.|`|uauJyxJNaa	Don't generalize.  I'm a girl, and have no interest in becoming a lesbian.    As for your question specifically, I do have a couple of lesbian friends at work.  And yes, their needs may or may not require finding a life partner, just like everybody else.  But lesbians would NEVER settle with a man.  (Hence the word, LESBIAN)  And since bi-girls could go either way, I am sure they are dreaming of someone...whether it's a boy or a girl likely depends on the person.    FYI - If a girl is into girls, get over it.  You can't even compete.  Find a girl who likes boys!!|`|xBxAD5NZaa	i dont knnoww|`|jd1E4Szbaa	Of corse! duh silly :)|`|GLzVJBpQaa	i have no clue as i am not a lesbian. my friend is and i think that she does want to settle down with a life partner and have a baby. i think the bi chicks will pick a side and settle down.|`|XL5sB7PKaa	whatever the case may be, whether their bi/lesbian or gay, they will eventually settle down and what does it matter whether there gay or not, its there choice lol :)|`|mDTkpuiuaa	well if the first shot at love didn't do it for ya, then the second one should confirm it.  if telia tequila can't stick with one gender, then no one can.  but kudos to the show, it was great.|`|MgO4uuyoaa	Well i can only speak for myself. Being a single lesbian I can NOT wait to settle down with the love of my life.|`|fbQ2q6FMaa	Well I want to settle down someday and I'm a bisexual girl. I am in love with a girl but just know I've had more boyfriends than girlfriends.|`|bb7cc37c884e0d86b0b8f3f44235f9b3aa	I will treat this as a serious question because you seem to be serious. First of all, when you say "settle down" you mean marry a man and have babies don't you. The answer to this is that it varies from person to person. It may seem to you that every girl is "becoming" a lesbian but fear not, there are plenty of heterosexual women out there. Also it is most likely that the percentage of gay and lesbian Americans will stay relatively low as compared to the "traditional couples".    In short, people will do what they want, be with who they love, and live the way that makes them happy.|`|YMdYyRmqaa	I am bisexual and I am settling down right now with a woman and our 3 kids.   I am excited to get married and start a life together.|`|VoULdpX7aa	Personally,I think guys are OK for a fling,but I want to settle down with a girl.I dream about having a beautiful wife to dote on and care for.I consider myself a lesbian because I LOVE women,but I CAN appreciate beauty to some extent in men.(When I can stomach it.)  I also have to say that I don't like the people(No matter what sexuality.) who go sleeping around with everybody.I say dating is all you need until you find the perfect person.

mXsWyVueaa	I'm not "white" (though I got some in me), but I would say that they certainly are facing discrimination. Really we all are just by making a distinction, but take a look at this example:    What if a white guy said this, "When black will not be asked to give back, when brown can stick around, when yella will be mella, when the red man can get ahead man."    If a white guy said that ****, he would be tore apart. But a black man actually did say those things, and the last part of the line, "when white will embrace what is right."  How blatantly racist is that. He basically said that blacks are always made to give their stuff up, browns have to leave, yellows are quick to anger, reds are always trodden upon, and whites always do the wrong thing (i.e. screw everyone else over). This would have been bad enough if he had referred to people as their race vice the skin color, but no, he was derogatory and used the skin color.    Do you know who said this? The reverend that closed the inauguration said it. We should all be outraged at this, but because it was a black man that said it, it is allowed to just go by.    So, yes, whites do face more discrimination now.|`|mQJq2bm8aa	Of course! I'm in high school, and every day I'm discriminated against by teachers and other kids for my sexual orientation, and hair colour. My hair is bright, unnatural colours because I like to make a statement. It doesn't make any difference to other people at all! Also, its my choice who I kiss and go on dates with, isn't it? Just because I'm bisexual doesn't mean that I'm fake, looking for attention, or any less of a person. Its honestly irritating having to explain for the millionth time, that I do not have both a boyfriend and a girlfriend, and no, I will not kiss that random chick for five bucks...|`|3ODwQo3Haa	Yes, I don't think people take it seriously though, I grew up in a neighborhood that was mostly Mexicans and the girls always had a problem with me and would call me names even if I had never talked to them before they would just look at me and decide they didn't like me because I am white.  I don't think we face more discrimination than others but I do think that it is more socially acceptable to make fun of or stereotype white people I hear things all the time on TV or in music that sound racist to me but since it is a minority saying it about a white person no one cares      Kalina- I completely agree with what you are saying about that speech at the inauguration I was shocked when I heard that man say those things and yes if he were a white man he would be called a racist and would be told to apologize|`|UzZyxTtEaa	........|.....  ........|...Reginald...Denny....|||"|"...  ........|.........______________|||_|_...  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Yes, I was refused a promotion to a full-time position from a part-time at one of the national banks because I was white and the spot was slated for a black. I was lied to about why I did not get the position because they hired in someone from outside who was black. They promoted me later.

I think now a days the REAL problem is more inequality based on income then any of the others. If you have money it doesn't matter what color you are, life is easier and doors open up.

AA10455120	Basically, a loss of energy / loss of immune system when around such a person for extended periods. Headaches, and random muscle pains are also symptoms.     If you're wondering if you are one, ask your friends if they feel drained or get headaches or get sick whenever they're around you. Another symptom would be if you are only cheerful/energetic/healthy when you spend long periods around people, especially crowds.

The fact that you are so uninvolved makes people upset, because they are involved when it comes to spreading rumors, being offended by other people, feeling accepted, and trying to get through their lives.  So here you are, all friendly, not bothering anyone, seemingly happy and content, and other people want this, they just don't know how to be quiet and calm in the world we live in, and the fact that you are so different confuses them and makes them upset.  So they project this on to you, it helps them feel better about themselves.  They know you are a good person, so they suddenly feel like they are bad.  Just keep being who you are, continue being friendly, don't change a thing.  I'm sorry that others are reacting to you this way.|`|2627cac9473c3926f2a6376b47a7cb53aa	be patient.

For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law. Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, competing against another, envying one another. My friends, if anyone is detected in a transgression, you who have received the Spirit should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. Take care that you yourselves are not tempted. visit: www.angdatingdaan.org for more teachings.|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I am exactly the same way. There is nothing wrong with being calm and quiet.

83MUfJ0haa	The reality    "On Hitlers rise to power, the ten Grand Lodges of Germany were dissolved.3 Many among the prominent dignitaries and members of the Order were sent to concentration camps. The Gestapo seized the membership lists of the Grand Lodges and looted their libraries and collections of Masonic objects. Much of this loot was then exhibited in an "Anti-Masonic Exposition" inaugurated in 1937 by Herr Dr. Joseph Goebbels in Munich. The Exposition included completely furnished Masonic temples.    "The persecution was carried over into Austria when the country was captured by the Nazis. The Masters of the various Vienna lodges were immediately confined in the most notorious concentration camps, including the horrible living hell at Dachau in Bavaria. The same procedure was repeated when Hitler took over Czechoslovakia, then Poland. Immediately after conquering Holland and Belgium, the Nazis ordered the dissolution of the lodges in those nations. It was also Point One on the agenda of Major Quisling in Norway. It may be taken as part of the same ugly picture that General Franco of Spain in 1940 sentenced all Freemasons in his realm automatically to ten years in prison. When France fell last June, the Vichy government caused the two Masonic bodies of France, the Grand Orient and the Grande Loge to be dissolved, their property being seized and sold at auction." 4    Hitlers hatred of Freemasonry is clearly documented.5 In 1931 Nazi party officials were given a "Guide and Instructional Letter" that stated, "The natural hostility of the peasant against the Jews, and his hostility against the Freemason as a servant of the Jew, must be worked up to a frenzy." 6 On April 7, 1933, Hermann Goeringwho once considered becoming a freemasonheld an interview with Grand Master von Heeringen of the "Land" Grand Lodge of Germany, telling him there was no place for Freemasonry in Nazi Germany. 7 The Nazi Primer, the Official Handbook for the Schooling of Hitler Youth, attacked freemasons, marxists, and the Christian churches for their "mistaken teaching of the equality of all men" by which they were said to be seeking power over the whole world. 8    Hitler, in his own words:    "To strengthen his political position he [the Jew] tries to tear down the racial and civil barriers which for a time continue to restrain him at every step. To this end he fights with all the tenacity innate in him for religious toleranceand in Freemasonry, which has succumbed to him completely, he has an excellent instrument with which to fight for his aims and put them across. The governing circles and the higher strata of the political and economic bourgeoisie are brought into his nets by the strings of Freemasonry, and never need to suspect what is happening.    "Only the deeper and broader strata of the people as such, or rather that class which is beginning to wake up and fight for its rights and freedom, cannot yet be sufficiently taken in by these methods. But this is more necessary than anything else; for the Jew feels that the possibility of his rising to a dominant role exists only if there is someone ahead of him to clear the way; and this someone he thinks he can recognize in the bourgeoisie, in their broadest strata in fact. The glovemakers and linen weavers, however, cannot be caught in the fine net of Freemasonry; no, for them coarser but no less drastic means must be employed. Thus Freemasonry is joined by a second weapon in the service of the Jews: the press. With all his perseverance and dexterity he seizes possession of it. With it he slowly begins to grip and ensnare, to guide and to push all public life, since he is in a position to create and direct that power which, under the name of 'public op|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	Gypsies are only good for their tears.

5vO61nuvaa	I'm Cuban..   And as far as my family is concerned, no one is disgusted by it whatsoever. That said, we do feel that there are just some places where it is completely inappropriate to do it.. like in the middle of a restaurant... or in an elevator. Something like that, there are always bathrooms that you can go to to feed the baby.    But, there is something that I'd like to say on this subject. Some people really get offended when others feel that public breastfeeding is gross or taboo, whatever. I don't think that just because you feel it is a beautiful and natural thing that everyone else should feel the same way.. I think its only fair that you find the proper places to do it in case others feel uncomfortable with it. But, thats just my opinion. Like everything in life... there is a time, and there is a place.
fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Yes.  I believe that we can't escape the fact that the universe has a cause. Everything else we see happening has a cause. No theory, like the big bang, evolution or any theory or science will ever be able to explain this philisophical question. "Why are we here?, How did life begin?" Life began in the past, so we can't wind back time and find out. Evolution does not explain how the first self replicating cell came into existence.  From the very beginning God revealed himself to the man he created Adam. From that time on history was recorded, and God communicated to man from time to time.   The philosophy that the universe, and life has no cause, and no purpose is preposterous, and I cannot accept it. There has to be a cause and a perpose, and there has to be an intelligent designer. Nothing else makes sense.  the Bible explains how God is holy, and is love, and that his ways are much more sophisticated than man can fathom. We can only begin to understand God through reading the Bible, and we can't understand spiritual things unless we are born of the spirit, which comes when you accept Jesus as your savior see the link for more information. If you seek you will find.|`|AA10354985	I believe there is something far greater than ourselves that created this world. I do not completely believe all that is written in the bible as it was written by man.  Some writings were for time period of their time and no longer apply in today's world.  I do not believe in religions either as they vary so much from church to church and then there are the cults.  I do believe that whatever we call the creator of earth to be alive and well. You can see this in the stars, oceans, sun and just about everything you can see, smell, or hear. Something has orchestrated this world and has given us our free will. For those who believe the world was made in 7 days is ok with me, for others who believe in the big bang is also ok with me. The bottom line is something  caused these things to happen and if we choose to put a name to this creator, that again is ok by me, I will find out one day as I am sure we all will.  I can say that I was given an inner instinct which has saved my life many times over and the messages have come to me strong and loud although I am sure no one else could have heard them.  So believe what you will, but be careful not to believe in man, we are the ones who are destroying this world and sadly the bible does tell us man will be the destruction of this world, surely you can see this happening.  So I will listen to the wind, smell the air, stand in amazement of the colorful rainbows that are so beautiful, watch the birds and all life go about their business with-out every being taught how to do so. I will watch in amazement as the sun sets and comes up, I will sit in the forest and admire the stillness while the life there goes about it's business and I will take peace from the knowledge that things are far above my human mind's  eyes   I will accept that somehow I am spiritully connected to something that is far  greater than man, that something which is so great and powerful that no man can understand or  duplicate in any form,   I will feel sadden by the greed of others who destroys our earth for their greed of money and I will watch as the earth fights back, it is doing this right now    You may choose to stand still and take a good look at the world/listen to the rain and decide if any man could have possibly made all this beauty, or you can decide to go ahead and deny all these things so you won't need to look at yourself, your children, neighbours etc to continue on with no conviction while you can take what you want, destroy what you want and expect no repercussions,  however, if your intelligent enough to acknowledge that the earth is fighting back, you may to do the right thing and decide to help those who are fighting so hard to let us know we are destroying our earth before all the money in this world can not buy you one cold glass of water to quinch your thirst, breath fresh air into your lungs, or hide you from nature wrath.    So at the end of earth's time, you can breath your last breath debating if there is something far greater than us here on earth and whether or not if there is a God awaiting to hear your story, btw, don't try to buy your way out, I am sure the creator is not interested in how you abused the world.|`|sWrHYZ5Waa	Why, do you?

Simple facts. Like the Quran itself, the Quran's mathematical Miracle ranges from the very simple , to the very complex. The simple facts are those observations that can be ascertained without using any tools. The complex facts require the assistance of a calculator or a computer. The following facts do not require any tools to be verified, but please remember they all refer to the original Arabic text: 1- The first verse 1:1 known as "Basmalla" consists of 19 letters. 2-This verse was revealed to Muhammed after 74:30, which states "Over it is 19". not a coincidence. 3-The Quran consists of 114 suras, which is 19X6. 4-The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or 19X334 (6234 numbered verses and 112 unnumbered verses (Basmalla). 6234+112=6346. notice also that 6+3+4+6= 19 5-The Basmalla occurs in the Quran 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) and 114 = 19 X 6 6-From the missing Basmalla of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalla of Sura 27, there are precisely 19 Suras. 7-It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 9+10+11+12..... . +26+27) is 342, or 19X 18 8-This total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmallas of sura 27. and 342 = 19X18 9-The famous first revelation (96:1-5) consists of 19 words. 10-This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters, & 76=19X4 11-Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of 19 verses. 12-This first Chronological sura is placed atop the last 19 suras. 13-Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters and 304 = 19X16 14-The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of 19 words. 15-14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of "Quranic Initials" (Such as A.L.M., of 2:1) and prefix 29 suras.These numbers add up to 14+14+29=57 19 X 3 16-The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic initials occur is 2+3+7....+50+68=822, and 822 +14 (14 sets of initials)=836 =19X44 17-Between the first intialed Sura (Sura 2) and the last intialed Sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras , 38=19X2 18-Between the first and last initialed sura there are 19 sets of alternating "initialed" and "uninitialed" Suras, 19-The Quran mention 30 different whole numbers throughout, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,19,20,30,40,5... 3000,5000,50,000, & 100,000. The sum of these numbers is 162146 = 19X8534 The following 2 facts may need some help with a calculator. 20- The word God (ALLAH) occurs throughout the Quran in its 114 Suras 2698 times and 2698= 19X142. 21-The number of verses where the word God occurs add up to 118123 also a multiple of 19, = 19X6217 22-The Quran's dominant message is that there is only "ONE GOD" The word 'One", in Arabic "Wahid" in reference to God occurs 19 times throughout the Quran. 23-The word "Wahid" itself, (one) has a numerical value of 19. W=6, A=1, H=8, D= 4. These are a well known values. 24-The word "Quran" occurs in the Quran 58 times, with one of them referring to "another Quran" in 10:15, therefore, if excluded, the frequency of "this Quran" in the Quran is 57, or 19X3 25- The first Pillar of Islam is stated in 3:18 as "La Elaaha Ella Hoo".(There is no other God besides Him). This most important expression occurs in 19 suras.   From the website: http://www.submission.org/miracle/simpl.... evolution of the embryo inside the maternal uterus is only briefly described, but the description is accurate, because the simple words referring to it correspond exactly to fundamental stages in its growth. This is what we read in a verse from the chapter al-Muminoon: I fashioned the clinging entity into a chewed lump of flesh and I fashioned the chewed flesh into bones and I clothed the bones with intact flesh. Quran, 23:14 The term chewed flesh (mudghah) corresponds exactly to the appearance of the embryo at a certain stage in its development. It is known that the bones develop inside this mass and that they are then covered with muscle. This is the meaning of the term intact flesh (lahm). The embryo passes through a stage where some parts are in proportion and others out of proportion with what is later to become the individual. This is the obvious meaning of a verse in the chapter al-Hajj, which reads as follows: I fashioned (humans) a clinging entity, then into a lump of flesh in proportion and out of proportion. Quran, 22:5. Next, we have a reference to the appearance of the senses and internal organs in the chapter as-Sajdah: ... and (God) gave you ears, eyes and hearts. Quran, 32:9 Nothing here contradicts todays data and, furthermore, none of the mistaken ideas of the time have crept into the Quran.|`|xFXgkA95aa	I can feel something.|`|vUpjOUQQaa	Yes to all the questions|`|u6Wyxmuvaa	I don't believe in anything.

DfDss68haa	Thes articles about Afro Latinos will clear it up:<br>  <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/ne...</a><br>  The confusion becomes very clear once you realize Latino is not a race. I was confused by this too. I thought Zoe Saldana was trying to claim something she was not. I guess I figured she was a latina who looked kind of black. Boy was I wrong. And as for the black Latinos who try to deny any connection to being black and embrace only their "Latino" heritage, like I have known some Dominicans and Puerto Rican Americans with obvious Afro Latino background who will get very angry with you if you call them black. Or they only talk about being Taino Indian or having a Spanish great great great great great grandmother. Basically those types of Afro Latinos have self hatred issues. I respect Zoe, she had the option to be one of those types. Many people try to make her out to be a "Latina" or a Spanish woman or Native American becuase she is pretty in a Eurocentric sense, probably multiracial like many Latinas and successful. But she keeps reiterating, "I am not Spanish, I am a black woman. There is a difference." Good for her. So the better question is, "Why do some Black latinos identify as only Latino?" <br>  <br>  How did Latin America come to be so racially mixed and diverse? Read on. Like any other race, "Hispanic" is an attempt for the human mind to categorize and pigeonhole something which is far too diverse. Another example of why race does not exist outside a social construct that only exists in our minds. I recently found out what Hispanics are and it blew my mind.<br>  <br>  I never really thought much about why Mexicans speak Spanish when Spanish originated in a country an ocean away. Or why "Latino countries" like Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, everything in South America, Mexico, etc had all colors of people from ebony to ivory. I guess I just thought these were really a race of people. Wrong. <br>  <br>  It began, as it usually does in recent history, with Europe and it's ever grasping attempts to control, colonize and seek out riches in the Americas. I mean when you think about it every area of the world has the stamp of European imperialism on it.<br>  <br>  But I digress, the point is that the Americas and the native people of the Americas (not just USA native Americans) were decimated by European colonialisation. I always thought Africa had it bad (which it did) but the various native peoples in many islands, and countries in the Americas had it worse. They are all but gone as the European diseases killed them off when slavery did not. The few that were left, in varying degree depending on what Hispanic country you speak off, bred with the Spanish conquistadors and the African slaves that were imported onto the island. Eventually at various times, the majority people (the African and native descendants) broke free and gained control of their own country, throwing off the shackles of Europe. <br>  <br>  So when people speak of Latin America and Hispanic countries these people are generally Native indians, Spanish whites (though there are other Europeans in Latin countries),African blacks, or even Asian. Or they are combinations of all of the above. This is why you can be hispanic black, hispanic white etc. So saying that Latino is a race is like saying American is a race. Black Latinos are just like Black Americans who are descendants of slaves. They were brought to the new world as slaves from West Africa. The only difference is that they were brought to South America and were colonized by Spain instead of England. Yes they have their own culture that is a mix of Spanish, African and Native American depending on what country you are talking about but they are still black people racially and part of the African diaspora.<br>  <br>  EDIT: At Adam I am aware that when it gets down to it race is a social constuct and not a bioligical one and this whole point is stupid. But black is more a "race" than Latino. Blacks are people from Africa, there is some basis to call someone black. But Latino doesn't even have that. Latinos are a culture at best. AND that doesn't change the fact many Afro Latinos are ashamed of their African heritage and THAT is my point.|`|aUScPZFYaa	I'm Jamaican, Dominican, and Puerto Rican.

Nigerian Samira I would imagine would rather be called Nigerian if that is in fact where she is from in lew there of being called black.  Its really personal choice I believe.  People will identify with the culture they are around no matter how much they strive for individuality.  Then you have to really look at the fact of "What identifies Black or Latino culture''  Just because someone listened to Rap and wears Sean John clothes doesnt make then identify as black.  And just because somone listens to Ranchero style music and wears Dickeys jeans and drives a low  rider rag top car doesn't mean they are Latino. To say someone is Black or Latino is politically incorrect to begin with as well.  I would say that those people are just being who THEY think they are.  People change their image all the time despite what they think.  Take me for instance.  I listen to 70's, 80's Heavy metal and wear AC DC shirts and stuff like that so one would assume that I am a music dork and a punk.  But in reality I can't play any music worth a damn and I play golf and baseball.

They are speaking about the differance between the "Old Testement" and the "New Testement" as a "Covenent Between God and "ALL" his People".  Please Remember....Mosiac Law of the Old Testement, was fulfilled by Jesus Christ, therefore a New Covenent was created by the Death of Jesus Christ on the Cross.<br>  <br>  "The Gospel of Jesus Christ" has not changed.<br>  You must come to Jesus Christ and ask for your forgiveness of sin and then you must live by the Word of God, the Bible<br>  <br>  There is no "Changing of the Guard" to mystify anyone!!<br>  <br>  It is simply a New Covenant between God and His People, brought about by the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ's death on the Cross..|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	There are as many translations as their are opinions about God.  All false, all for the sake of mankind and his own desires, as well as mankind's own ego.  All have misrepresented God into a religious horrific - jealous entity.  That is why so many have left religion today.  Mankind has made it all about 'himself' instead.  Making it okay to kill in God's name, etc...<br>  <br>  If you recall, in revelation it speaks of false religions, which are all over the place today, none of them are True, each hold very little of the truth.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is listen to your own heart, not someone else's.  Religion isn't a necessity component to have belief in or Love for God.  Over the centuries mankind has made God in to his own image for his own personal and selfish gain.<br>  <br>  Religion breeds nothing but chaos and confusion.  :)|`|c3c929d881bbaa941b342e13693b8713aa	Jesus said my yoke is easy and my burden is light.

Yes, Jesus was preaching only to the Jews about the Kingdom at that specific time, but as Christ was risen, Paul was  given the task of sharing that gospel with the gentiles so they too may beleive. <br>  <br>  The reason for Christ only preaching to the Jews first (and then the gentiles) is because the Jews were His chosen people, which means they understood God's laws and His awaited coming as the Messiah. When Christ died and was ressurected, however, The Holy spirit was able to then come down to the gentiles, and now the gentiles can pray to the living God as well. Christ ripped open the tabernacle, and became the mediator for All to come to God and worship Him. So yes, I do agree with this message.|`|G8blMPX8aa	What I really hate is when people propound theories which can be shown to have been totally unnecessary, had they just taken the time to do a LITTLE research. Millions of Christians never bother to study their Bibles, because someone told them that they needed someone else to understand it for them, because they NEVER COULD- and they BELIEVED them!<br>  <br>     DEUTERONOMY 18:17-22.<br>  <br>  17. And the LORD said unto me, <br>  "They have well spoken that which they have spoken.<br>  18. "I will raise them up a Prophet from among their Brethren,<br>  like unto thee, and will put My Words in his mouth;<br>  and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.<br>  19. "And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken<br>  unto My Words which he shall speak in My Name, <br>  I will require it of him.<br>  20. "But the prophet, which shall presume <br>  to speak a word in My Name, <br>  which I have not commanded him to speak, <br>  or that shall speak in the name of other gods, <br>  even that prophet shall die.<br>  21. "And if thou say in thine heart, <br>  'How shall we know the word <br>  which the LORD hath not spoken?'<br>  22. "When a prophet speaketh in The Name of The LORD, <br>  if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, <br>  that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken,<br>  but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously:<br>  thou shalt not be afraid of him.' "<br>  <br>  DOES THE BIBLE say ANYTHING here or ANYWHERE about an "ASSISTANT PROPHET" who has to come and help him to save the World? That job was for JESUS ALONE.<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 24:14.<br>  <br>  14. "And THIS GOSPEL of The Kingdom <br>  shall be preached in all the World <br>  for a witness unto all nations; <br>  and then shall The End come."<br>  <br>  WAS THERE ANYTHING said anywhere about ANOTHER GOSPEL being raised up to supplant and overthrow that of JESUS?<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 24:35.<br>  <br>  35. "Heaven and Earth shall pass away, <br>  but my Words shall not pass away."<br>  <br>  WHEN I ASK CHRISTIANS, "What are the BENEFITS of FOLLOWING PAUL?" they get so ANGRY! WHY? <br>  The benefits of following JESUS are CLEARLY DEFINED:<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 7:21-25.<br>  <br>  21. "Not every one that saith unto me, 'Lord, Lord,'<br>  shall enter into The Kingdom of Heaven; <br>  but he that doeth The Will of my Father Which is in Heaven.<br>  22. "Many will say to me in That Day, <br>  'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy Name? <br>  and in thy Name have cast out Devils? <br>  and in thy Name done many wonderful works?'<br>  23. "And then will I profess unto them, <br>  'I never knew you: depart from me, <br>  ye that work iniquity.'<br>  24. "Therefore whosoever heareth <br>  these Sayings of mine, and doeth them, <br>  I will liken him unto a Wise Man, <br>  which built his House upon a Rock:<br>  25. "And the rain descended, and the floods came, <br>  and the winds blew, and beat upon that House; <br>  and it Fell not: for it was founded upon a Rock."<br>  <br>  PAUL IS OBVIOUSLY someone who will boast of PROPHESYING, CASTING OUT DEVILS, and DOING WONDERFUL WORKS in Jesus' Name, WITHOUT KEEPING HIS SAYINGS, therefore Jesus will denounce him, and declare that he NEVER knew him.<br>  <br>  ALL of the elements are there; Paul has the Signs and Wonders, and the NONCOMPLIANCE with Jesus' Sayings. Most supposed Christians would not even know what the sayings of Jesus are, and so would have no idea where Paul violated them. <br>  <br>  For instance, Paul taught ALL the EVIL PRINCIPLES of Phariseeism that Jesus identified.<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 23:1-9.<br>  <br>  THEN spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his Disciples,<br>  2. Saying,<br>  "The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:<br>  3. "All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, <br>  that observe and do; but do not ye after their works:<br>  for they say, and do not.<br>  4. "For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne,<br>  and lay them on men's shoulders; <br>  but they themselves will not move them <br>  with one of their fingers.<br>  5. "But all their works they do for to be seen of men:<br>  they make broad their phylacteries, <br>  and enlarge the borders of their garments,<br>  6. "And love the Uppermost Rooms at feasts,<br>  and the Chief Seats in the Synagogues,<br>  7. "And greetings in the markets, <br>  and to be called of men, 'Rabbi, Rabbi.'<br>  8. "But be not ye called 'Rabbi:'<br>  for one is your Master, even Christ; <br>  and all ye are Brethren.<br>  9. "And call no man your father upon the Earth:<br>  for one is your Father, Which is in Heaven."<br>  <br>  THIS DESCRIBES PAUL to a "T"!<br>  <br>     GALATIANS 1:8-9<br>  <br>  8. But though we, or an Angel from Heaven, <br>  preach any other Gospel unto you <br>  than that which we have preached unto you, <br>  let him be accursed.<br>  9. As we said before, so say I now again, <br>  "If any man preach any other Gospel unto you <br>  than that ye have received, let him be accursed."<br>  <br>  MANY CHRISTIANS will not even acknowledge, though you sit them down ansd show them the Scriptures one by one, that Paul preached a DIFFERENT Gospel to that JESUS preached AND COMMANDED US to preach. Since you have saved me the trouble of having to prove that tediously, let me just tell you that Paul's Ministry is COUNTERFEIT. It has NO basis at all.<br>  <br>     MATTHEW 5:43-46.<br>  <br>  43.

The "sin now, pray later" version.<br>  <br>  There is something about Saul/Paul that few people realize, even though it is obvious. His job was to issue arrest warrants to the Romans in control. The Romans did not hire him, he was Jewish, he worked for the local Israelite governors. The Romans just arrested whoever they wanted.

What brought us together initially,was probably one of,if not the most important part of it was sex.It was an incredibly enjoyable sexlife that kept it going way beyond it's due date.    Trouble was outside our bedroom it had been stale a while and in the last year or 18 months we both gave up on it and seemed to take our pleasure winding each other up and pissing each other off.    Right up to the final split we both tried to keep it going,habit and familiarity (and sex) more than anything even though we couldn't sit long before starting,moaning,winding each other up.    The final split saw me moving into a horrible,pokey bedsit with most my clothes and manageable possesions in the boot of my car.I sat in my non descript boxroom,not sure what to do with myself,this woman was there everyday for 11 years,as fed up of fighting with her as I was she'd been in my mind and part of most everything I did for over a decade.    I felt low,unmotivated,lost,confused yet to my extreme surprise also just so relieved.Not because I only had to think for myself now,that I found unimportant for ages but because the fighting,the point scoring,reunions and splits,anger and guilt was over.    As the days went by I still missed her a lot,felt a large hole in my life,missed someone beside me on the couch or in the bed,quickly got frustrated as I had lost my healthy sex life.    Now it's just over 8 months on,I've found some easy going friendships that provide that important sexual outlet and company when it desired but I have no interest in another proper relationship at all|`|AA11616170	My relationship broke up after 25 years, but he had been involved with someone else for several years before that, and for a few years afterwards.  I found it very traumatic, and wasn't interested in another, mainly because I hoped he would realise the worth of all he had thrown away and we might find a new way forward together.  The other relationship didn't last, and no, we didn't find that new way forward.  Today I believe there is no going back and picking up from where we left off  -  we are different people now.  Anyway, it was an horrific time emotionally, and I don't want a repeat.  I'm not looking for anyone else  -  more a fear of 'out of the frying pan'  ...  anyway, from what I hear, there are too many out there who want only a physical relationship, no strings attached.

My marriage ended after 16 years. And as bad as you think it can be, it can (and probably will) get worse.  Gather yourself together, and only look forward.  Look after yourself, only.  You are not meant to be alone. But, you are no longer a victim.  With this in mind, carry out your day to day activities.  Do not appear vulnerable.  You are on your own! And, you are O.K.  Eventually, you will meet someone.  And, you'll be ready.|`|a4LWildhaa	Not I-my now ex-wife. Gave me the three kids as well.

Relationships need love, they need to be nurtured, the couple who plays together stays together ! You have to put some work into it to keep it good, and to stay interested in each other.    So many couples stop dating when they move in together, this is not a good thing to do.  You have to still have date night, flirt with each other, laugh together, dance to the music on the radio or the TV, have shared activities and explore new ones, and talk to each other -    Turn off the telly, sit out on the patio with a drink and talk as if he is your best friend who has just dropped in.     Love was there once, you let it slip away, become friends again, show you care - if you want to try and recover what you once had with this man.    And if none of that works, then I guess its time to part ways permanently, if you think you will be happier on your own.    You seem a little depressed and feeling it will just happen again, it could, but here is no rush to find someone new, you have to find yourself first and become reaquainted with who you are, because its been awhile. I think you have stopped thinking of yourself as being in a romantic relationship or as a romantic partner, you need to get your groove back and feel like a desirable woman again.    Whatever reason for a breakup it is still an ending, and you have to allow yourself time to get over it.  Start loving yourself and doing things that reaffirm who you are, and that you deserve love and romance in your life.    Tiny steps and soon you will be up and dancing again.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	sounds very normal to me. Knowing this will allow you to move on with life. It is ok to seek other avenues of happiness and fullfillment. Put yourself first.  It is often when we are not looking that we find we meet someone else. Then you can take the time to get to know someone and to determine if that is what you want.    Enjoy your time. You are worth it. Best to you.|`|AA10405438	After twenty years I just wanted to be alone and know me first.  I dated a lot, but not seriously until I met the man I knew I would spend the rest of my life with.

Well there must have been an incredibly good reason to split up. Considering that, you should certainly consider dating other people, if your interested in finding someone else.     There are too many people in the world, you have yourself convinced way to early there is no one else you would find interesting.|`|tI7QP3dkaa	Yes - I woke up one morning after being married for 12 years thinking "this is not where I want to be"  so after some grief got a divorce.    The next relationship lasted 10 years and the same happened.      We have common interests when we meet and start a relationship but life's path takes us into different directions and turns us into different people - nothing in common any more.  I guess it takes a lot of work for that not to happen.   We live out lives these days and we go our own ways doing things - then suddenly realise it is not working and we are different people.

I would answer your question completely, but I would be called a racist and probably get flagged. <br>  <br>  Good Luck hun. (:<br>  <br>  -Jen|`|AA11280073	You just don't get it. There is no way that cartoon could have applied to Bush. It compares Obama to an ape, an old racist stereotype. Lots of newspapers criticize Obama without being racist. That cartoon crossed the line of what is decent to publish. It never should have been approved by the editor. They have apologized several times.|`|5vO61nuvaa	I agree with you 100%|`|e461600319c13daf783803b3303f8317aa	I think that if they're reasonable in what they print (as with any other politicians), then it shouldn't be a problem. The key to not coming across as racist is to stick to the facts and the topic at hand, and simply not be racist! You can criticize the bloody hell out of him and his policies without going the race route. Is that so hard to do? I've seen images of Bush portrayed as a monkey, but, as far as I know, never in a serious, legitimate paper. Certainly, Obama's being elected shows that we've made some pretty good progress in terms of race relations- but don't think by any stretch of the imagination that we're all good now and ready to go, that racism is no more, just because we have a black president- you are beyond being sadly mistaken if you believe that! No black publication ever portrayed Bush with his hood and robe, riding horseback, so why should a respected publication  portray Obama as a monkey?
QOY0PEG5aa	Rosetta Stone might be a good way of learning a language well...    But for learning a language fluently, you need to surround yourself with fluent or native speakers of that language.    I learned French and Esperanto in that way, and I also went to Spain to learn Spanish and Catalan that way.    I usually study a language by buying as many books in that language, and about that language, while talking to people who speak that language.    I learn pretty well by reading Wikipedia articles in other languages.    French Wikipedia: fr.wikipedia.org  Spanish Wikipedia: es.wikipedia.org|`|axxQzOCHaa	reading books, magasines, browsing websites .. I've done it to some extent with finnish  have no personal experience with RS however I am fluent in french, spanish and english|`|0KR4wyoQaa	No Rosetta Stone.    Take courses in the language, practice with native speakers, listen to radio and watch television and read in the language.|`|170c8a77f6030f45fedeed6a6258a433aa	Take a class at a college. You need to learn verb conjugation first and the audio courses don't do that. Then use the audio courses for practice while commuting. Being around people who speak the language will force you to use it. If you want to learn Italian spend time in the restroom at Macaroni Grill where they play the course continually.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	My experience has always been that unless you actually do live in the langauge, you'll never become truly fluent.     You can do pretty well, I hear with Rosetta Stone, at preparing yourself for living in the language, but I don't believe you'll ever get there without immersion.|`|vpL67nETaa	I do not recommend Rosetta Stone.  It's good to help get you aquainted with a language, but it isn't worth the hefty price tag.    I recommend that everyone who wants to learn a new language starts by taking a class.    They say that you if you can speak 50 words in any one language, you can survive in that country.    While immersion is the best way to learn, I wouldn't recommend someone who can't even speak a sentence to go spend a week in the heart of Tijuana to try and learn Spanish.    You need SOME level of exposure.    After you've gotten some concept of how sentences are formed, immersion will help you attain fluency.    It's VERY important to practice.    Even though most american high schoolers take 3 years of a language, most of them cannot speak the language at all a year after they graduate.  Because they don't practice.    When I started learning spanish in classes at my college, I'd come home everynight and practice speaking. That way I'd remember the vocabulary and the grammar.  I'd talk to the busboys and the dishwashers at the restaurant where I worked.  I personally think it's imperative that you speak what you're learning as practice.    Find someone, maybe even through myspace or facebook, that speaks the language you want to learn, and become e-pen pals. Practice writing to them.    Good luck!|`|seYJ2iKnaa	Emerge your self with the language, do the learning by doing it the same like a native speaker, for example, I am not an English native speaker, but because I love English since I was a kid (after I watch Sesame Street - a kid learning program some 20 years ago), I started to read everything in English, I watch English movie without subtitle, listen only to English songs (ha ha), and try to write day to day experience in English for my diary. Now because I always watch American movie as much as I can without looking at the subtitle, some people said that I have an American accent. The second, do things you love that you can do in that language, for example, I love to read romance novels, but mostly in my first language, but at that time in my college there are no Indonesian novels available like I used to read in High School, and the only available ones is English, so I started to read it. Boy...I need like two weeks to understand the first page only, and then gradually I can finish a book (by Barbara Cartland) for a month, after that it's easier and now I can read English book like any people who's using English as their first language. So find something that you love, for example, if you want to learn French, and you love music, listen to French song. I am learning Japanese too, through Anime. And because once the animes I bought have no substitle in it, I read it point blank, and after a few episodes, I started to understand some of the words that often used in the anime. And I can apply those words in speaking. The third, that they say it's easier and faster to learn phrases by phrases then learn the language word by word, because using phrases or a conversation line, you can practice it directly.|`|7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	Rosetta Stone, even through Level 3, will not make you fluent. Fluency in any language requires years of hard work and study. There are no short cuts. The more exposure, the better: TV, radio, DVDs, music, books, magazines, etc. etc. etc.|`|ab0969c637900508350d036d0578f045aa	Nice to hear that you're interested in languages. Get ready for a long-winded answer.    Usually, I would sit in to watch a 30-minutes comedy/variety show in that particular language. I'm learning French now and I can't get that on my local TV so I depend on the Net. I usually watch this right after I get home from work/school.     I also watch French news every morning. Again, I stream it through the Net. I think French news are 'heavier' in substance and language so I make a habit of watching them in the morning when I'm still alert.    I also keep a close watch on up-coming French movies. I'll watch those that interest me. Now, the purpose of constantly watching French films is basically to 'virtually' submerge myself in the way locals over there communicate and interact. After some time, their accents, language, grammar and what-not will start to lodge themselves into my brain.    Of course, it's important to get the basics right before you even attempt all that. My advice for this is to enroll in a basic course for that particular language.     These courses work for some people while others will find it difficult to keep up. So you could just attend the basic courses and continue on your own after you've gotten the basics down right. Of course, it's best to stick to the course and advance along with it. You've got a 'guide' there and it would probably serve as an extra help along with your personal revision.    Audio tapes and songs are another great way to get yourself 'used' to the language. These are usually available online or at your local library.  Speaking to those who are well-versed in that language is a BIG help as well. Make friends with them. Google pen-pals or e-mail pals from those countries as well.    Lastly, I would get lots of story books and exercise books in that language. To practice and test myself. Story books will give you lots of verbs you've never even come across previously. Keep a notebook or something.    Hope that helps!|`|RcB2FNWRaa	No textbook or internet/computer program can compare to being immersed in a situation where you will be surrounded by a language.  Taking a class for one or two hours or week, or using a computer program sporadically, for example, will not prepare you for the mental challenge that comes with trying to understand or speak another language.    Now, that being said, the next best thing is to have a teacher, an actual living person who sits with you and speaks to you, corrects you and encourages you.  Sitting in front of a computer screen or reading a book lacks the interpersonal connection that is often needed when learning a language.  Not only that, you need to know when you're making errors, so they can be corrected, and when you're improving, so you can get the oft-needed ego boost that comes from being encouraged.    I tried learning several languages by myself when I was younger, but funnily enough, the only language I've learnt in my adult years has been Czech (a difficult language for me), as I had a teacher.  So if you can find a teacher, go for it.  If not, then at least using books and programs to acquaint yourself with a language will be better than doing nothing at all.    Good luck.

nisfxpXHaa	This afternoon I went out to the garage and I heard a strange sound. A sort of scratching sound. So I followed the sound and to my surprise I found that a vole ( sort of like a mole and a mouse) had climbed into my recycle bin and then actually crawled inside of and empty lemonade bottle.     I put the lid on the bottle and made some air holes for the little guy. Then I brought the bottle inside to show my daughters. They are very fascinated by animals. Then we took him over to the elementary a few blocks from our house. There is a large wooded area there as well as a pond. We released him into the woods.    It was such a joy to see my girls enthralled by something so simple. We stood and watched the little guy rummage around in the leaves and snow until he found a good hiding spot.

U9zRe7Oyaa	I think it depends. I'm medium height, and I like it. My short friends tend to get more attention, but most of them become annoying because of it. For example, they are obvious and make jokes about their height ALL THE TIME. It gets really old. There are the few that just laugh at the jokes and don't bring it up themselves. They're cool. So what I'm saying is, most of the time, being short makes people automatically annoying.|`|trMsK86jaa	From what i've observed in the past shorter people generally tend to have more stamina.

In the end though, it all comes down to personality-whether you're a nice, trustworthy, and moral person with a sense of humor and who's fun to be with. Don't change yourself for a guy, though. Be who you want to become; when someone gives you advice don't follow it so they'll like you, decide on whether that's something that YOU think is right. The only moral value that almost everyone can agree is right is to be who you want to be, so don't try to please everyone to yourself. Instead, to stand out, find something that you love doing and become the best you can be at it.

OKegTV8baa	The best way is to have someone to talk to you in Spanish all the time. Who better than your mother? Tell her you really want to learn Spanish and that you want her to talk to you in Spanish only. It will work.   Good luck!|`|Grmsgziaaa	I started to learn spanish as a second language at the age of 8. Just learn all the vocab words and verbs you can. Listen to tapes teaching Spanish in your sleep. Then start reading books about spanish and doing worksheets over it. Then when you kind of have a grip on spanish, read books and watch movies in spanish. Surround yourself with spanish speaking friends, you WILL learn alot.  I did all that, then stayed in Mexico for many summers, I also attended a Spanish School in Oaxaca Mexico for 2 weeks. I also listened to their accent and copied it. Now 10 years later I speak like a native, people cant beleive Im American how well I can speak.

I took college courses in spanish, and everyday at work I'd talk to the busboys and dishwashers using the things I learned that day.  The more you practice speaking, the more it sticks.

What it comes down to is that paul was a better salesman. I work in sales and to me that is all christianity is a big sales pitch. Paul was the better salesman so he got the credit. If under god's eyes we are all equal then this would be proof of the nonexistence of god, because god is infallible but he made a fault in choosing peter first. So if he faulted he no exist. You are trying to use unprovable data to prove your point. If I give you my opinion and then say it is proof that there is no god, does that make it true in your eyes, NO.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	My old complex had maintenance on radio, so if it were me I would have stood in front of her until she got him on the radio and they agreed to when he would be by.  But they were always fairly prompt with me.    It's one thing for them to come by and say it's something they cannot fix until later, but it's quite another to not show up at all to diagnose a problem.  She could be putting you off because a Saturday call costs them more, so I would try to tell her that hot water is a health department requirement, and if they don't get someone out to fix it, you will go get a motel room to take a shower and deduct the cost from your next rent.    I'm sure you'll get into a discussion about deductions, but this one they'd have a hard time defending if they wanted to escalate it.|`|lKsgF8bOaa	I have had my share of problems with maintenance and so I totally know how you feel.    Usually, when I need something, they would not come until the next day. Occasionally however, they do come shorty (meaning within an hour or two and not instantly).    It is understandable if they are busy and they cannot come right away to you. The problem however is that the manager should not have told you that they will be there shortly if they were not.    If they come tomorrow and all is well, do not report her unless this happens again. If not, then you probably need to do something about it and report the issue right way.|`|O4jGlC2caa	It could be a water pipe broke, and he was off fixing that.  Dirty cold water usually means a water line broke.  Running the water clears the lines.  Why he didn't get back to the manager is beyond me.  The maintenance is the one to be blamed in this situation, since the manager contacted him.      I don't think this is anything to get upset about.  I'm patient, so I'd probably prod the office throughout the day.  The matter should be fixed within 24 hours.   (I don't know what "It has been until then since" means, so no clue how long you waited.)  Meanwhile, I would've just boiled some water on the stove (kill the germies and warm it up) and given myself a bath the old-fashioned way (wash cloth and a bowl of warm water).  I also keep a spare gallon of drinking water in a cabinet for circumstances such as this.    Eh, I've been tent camping before, so things like this do not bother me.  I was looking at the news on the Yahoo! homepage.  Be happy you have any water at all.  Some people don't have electricity due to this storm that passed.|`|AA12374498	Non emergency is 14 days, emergency is 7 days, I think.  Usually they won't wait that long, they are just going down the list.  If you're worried that they won't fix it, just write them a letter about the problem, copy and mail certificate it, so you'll have proof.|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	wow, what a hissie fit you took.  If you wanted to bathe you could have heated the water on the stove and then bathed in the sink in that water when it slightly cooled.      The maintenance where I live, depending on what is needed, depending on how many others have the same identical problem, depending on who caused the problem (like maybe it's a city or county problem), and depending on if it's a weekday or weekend or an after-hours problem, well their service is superb and they get to me fairly quickly.  If it's an emergency like an AC need on a super hot day, or the toilet is overflowing, or an electricity problem, or a water leak, etc. they are here immediately if not sooner.    I believe your apartment manager did what she was supposed to do.  No need to report her.|`|D9LO2Y2Uaa	@Sophie B, you are a b***tch.  Why don't you leave the poor lady alone?  She is doing what is best for her.  Hey Kimma, if you have a problem with the manager not taking care of the problem you can always report her if she is  not doing her job.|`|Leda2ha0aa	When I lived in an apartment complex, the maintenance workers would be there by the end of the day if it were something important.  If it were life threatening (smelling of gas), they would be there right away.  Not having hot water may be an inconvenience, but I think they would be there quicker if you had absolutely no water.

Living in Zimbabwe, I see how the left can really mess a nation up and drive businesses out and then start to filter anything that goes against the fragile foundation they establish themselves on.  THe US has the Pelosis, Boxers, Feinsteins that are surely not good for a nation that is to prosper.  Your illegals in your country are not contributing anything except for low skilled jobs..  You are being divided and the left will rip you into two and life as you know it was turn to ^ell!
IxyQpOkpaa	Screw what everyone else thinks.  You are what you identify yourself as.  If you view yourself as multi-cultural, then that's what you are.  Me personally, most of my direct ancestors are black, but my grandmother's mother was Creole (French, Native American, Black), and her father was 1/2 Cherokee.  So I could easily say I'm multi-cultural, but I identify myself as black.  Even though I'm light-skinned with a "good" grade of hair.. good meaning not "nappy" like my peers.  I don't care, hair is hair.    Good luck!
ctOge9SLaa	He died for the " whosoever" <br>  God has never intended that man be eternally lost.

These ones who have been usurped and bullied by satan since the time of Adam.<br>  On the One hand, He foreknew some, predestinated and selected some to be conformed to the Image of His Son ( Rom 8:29). This is according to His foreknowledge AS God, Yet the word of God tells us, that God desires ALL MEN to be saved, and not just to be saved, but to come to the full knowledge of the Truth.<br>  1 Tim 2:4<br>   Who desire all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.<br>  <br>  He wants us to know the whole truth.

That there is WAY more to it than we can understand.|`|pakIAYWoaa	it is a symantical arguement that can get your head spinning.

ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	As written by W.B, Yeats.    THE Irish word for fairy is slteeltogue [sz"dlte6g], a diminutive of "shee" in banshee. Fairies are deenee shee [daoine sidhte] (fairy people).   Who are they? "Fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved, nor bad enough to be lost," say the peasantry. "The gods of the earth," says the Book of Armagh. "The gods of pagan Ireland," say the Irish antiquarians, "the Tuatha De Danan, who, when no longer worshipped and fed with offerings, dwindled away in the popular imagination, and now are only a few spans high."   And they will tell you, in proof, that the names of fairy chiefs are the names of old Danan heroes, and the places where they especially gather together, Danan burying-places, and that the Tuatha De Danan used also to be called the slooa-shee [slteagh sidhe] (the fairy host), or Marcra shee (the fairy cavalcade).   On the other hand, there is much evidence to prove them fallen angels. Witness the nature of the creatures, their caprice, their way of being good to the good and evil to the evil, having every charm but conscience-consistency. Beings so quickly offended that you must not speak much about them at all, and never call them anything but the" gentry," or else daoine maithe, which in English means good people, yet so easily pleased, they will do their best to keep misfortune away from you, if you leave a little milk for them on the window sill over night.    No hallucination unless you say all the folk of Eire are of a type quite common of some lands where they hide from all they cannot touch or know, because of their fear and hate.|`|QEEweJUaaa	Fairies exist in my opinion.|`|lESLtDnmaa	well fairies are actually real there is a video of them being examined. check it out.
6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You don't "have to."  There are reasons the customs came into being, though.  Delivery drivers do not get reimbursed for their expenses.  They get their hourly wage, but the gas and wear and tear on their car is their own issue.  So when you ask for something to be brought to your door, it's nice to give them a tip of a dollar or two.  If there is a stated delivery charge, no tip should be expected.  <br>  <br>  With hair dressers and waiters it's a little different.  Hair dressers are performing a personal service.  You're paying for the shampoo, cut, and blow dry, but the quality and attention to your expectations are what the tip is for.  If they do a poor job, no tip.  Most of them are actually renting the station where they work and have to bring their own clients.  There is no hourly compensation, just what they have to give the salon.  A lot of the money they actually get to keep is in the form of tips.  If you don't tip your hair dresser, don't expect decent service.<br>  <br>  Full service restaurants are the only places you should tip.  Not places like Sonic and definitely not baristas at Starbucks.  Those places pay their employees minimum wage or better.  Full service wait staff is paid a special minimum wage that needs to be made up to at least minimum wage by tips.  Restaurants that don't customarily generate the amount of tips necessary have to pay the standard minimum wage.  Any time the tips occasionally fall below that threshhold, the employer has to make up the difference.  Nevertheless, you're still getting a personal service.  In full service restaurants you can customize your order and even send it back.  The quality of the experience relies on the service of your waiter.  They're only paid to take your order and bring your meal.  They don't have to come by again until they bring the check.  If you want more, and if you get more, that's why you tip.<br>  <br>  I hope that answers your questions.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Like everyone else has said, they don't get paid all that much.<br>  <br>  And like Lucy said, they should definitely start teaching this in school. I wouldn't have known the answer to this question if my high school economics substitute teacher hadn't said "f*** it" to the curriculum and decided to teach us things that actually mattered in real life, like why you should tip.|`|5tvM9T7vaa	While it is true that individuals in the service industries are rarely paid minimum wage by their employers, that is not why we tip.

Also, it is widely accepted that the people we are tipping (waiters etc) are not very well paid and rely on tips to suplement their income. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|8WwZakvIaa	cuz...it's like this:<br>  <br>  restaurants pay $2.13 an hour...keeps the food price down<br>  a tip is motivation for excellant service|`|NktvqJhlaa	For me it's a sign of respect.

Without all that makeup and designer clothes they'd look just like us. whats bad about it, however, are the negative effects things like this often have on young women and girls, who aspire to look just like their favorite celebrities. i seriously don't think anorexia had existed until the barbie doll age.|`|6NEPcZFfaa	I think most celebrities are ugly, they all look like pez dispensers, but without anything in them. old Hollywood had very good looking people in it, but not anymore, they wear too much makeup.|`|1rlFqcVbaa	I think it is the fact that they are so much talked about.   Many young people feel like they are role models becuase of their looks. And they are always on the media scene.
NPViXP6Uaa	I agree with your opinion that the anonymity afforded by the internet breeds insensitivity. But I also think that the innate lack of repercussions has a lot to do with the 'jerk' mentality.     If you bash someone, hurt their feelings, slam their identity or views what will happen to you? Precisely, nothing...oh maybe a token slap on the wrist...or a warning that is truly laughable. But does it affect them in real life? Sadly, no not at all.     Another point that hit me is that the internet isolates people. Their interactions may be limited to a few words with people at work, or in passing at a supermarket. How to vent frustrations, then? Go online, find something that hits a hot button in your psyche and then rage against it with full fury. I think it's a rant against a society that has no center anymore and no common goal.    I've ranted myself here. I thought your question was thoughtful and well written. Thank you for bringing up a very valid and growing concern. I'm the Mum of a 13 year old and what's happening today is an illiterate and immoral society that's degrading by the day. Thanks for taking the time to read this.|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	That is the thing about the internet. Nobody knows anyone face to face. You can control so much behind some words and an avatar, and hide the biggest secrets. Overall, thats the risk when you join a discussion site as there are always going to be different types of people, even some you dont wish to run into.    Your question was long, and although it seemed a bit rantish, you got your point across well. Personally, i try to sound passive when talking about religion, even though im an atheist. But when did one small person make a difference? :)|`|924e4zDNaa	Life is like that! you do not have to take part.all the questions can be ignored if you don't like them.|`|QM2UqZmuaa	I agree with you.    However, it might be hard to find *** holes on the Internet that aren't actually *** holes in real life. You can find exceptions in young children, but really, bad people on the Internet tend to be bad in real life too.
rZmJGPidaa	Catholic simply means "universal." Catholic, when capitalized is usually in reference to the Catholic Church.    Catholic as an idea is derived from what Jesus taught. We are to love and accept, forgive and embrace, etc. Simply put, all are one in Jesus. Paul emphasizes the concept of "catholicity" in the letter to the Galatians.     "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus." Galatians 3:28.    It is okay to capitalize "catholic" in the profession of the faith. The belief in the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church can be explained this way:    Unity of the Church - Christ's Church is united in him, by him. We are one body. It is imperative that we remain united and equal, and that we minister to each other.    Sanctity of the Church - Christ's Church is holy because it is Christ's Church. His Church is his Kingdom on earth, and it exists in the hearts of the faithful. It is, and always will be, HIS Church. There are no "CEO's" or "Supreme Pontiffs" of his Church on earth, because he is the CEO, and he is the Supreme Pontiff. Anyone claiming that he or she is a supreme ruler of Christ's Church contradicts the essence of his Church. If it were ruled supremely by mankind, it would not be holy.    Catholicity of the Church - His Church is universal. It accepts everyone, and denies no one. All who come to him are welcome. It does not discriminate against anyone on the basis of anything. We are all children of God, whether we accept it or not, and as such, Christ welcomes everyone into his Church.    Apostolicity of the Church - While valid apostolic succession is required to maintain validity in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church, it is not required to be a part of Christ's Church. His church includes all of the faithful, not just Catholics. We must respect one another, and respect our differences. It is carried on by modern "apostles," faithful followers of Christ.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Small c catholic means universal or far-reaching.  It is seldom used in this form.  You can google it to get a more precise definition.  Uppercase C Catholic is the name of a church and/or religion.    Another example.  Joe lives in the white house across the street.  Obama lives in the White House.    (Spell check hasn't been updated to accept Obama!)|`|AA11440601	We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.  -- From the Nicene Creed, 325 C.E.    + Lower case "c" catholic means the Christian Church is universal. She proclaims the fullness of the faith. She bears in herself and administers the totality of the means of salvation. She is sent out to all peoples. She speaks to all men. She encompasses all times. She is "missionary of her very nature."    + Upper case "C" Catholic means the worldwide Catholic Church which is shepherded by the Pope.    Actually there are over 20 different Catholic Churches that make up the worldwide Catholic Church.    In addition to the Latin Rite (Roman) Catholic Church, the Eastern Rite Catholic Churches are in full communion with the Pope, and are part of the same worldwide Catholic Church.    Eastern Rite Catholic Churches include:    Alexandrian liturgical tradition   ? Coptic Catholic Church  ? Ethiopic Catholic Church    Antiochian (Antiochene or West-Syrian) liturgical tradition   ?

d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	This falls under the category of "Natural Consequences."  And one of those consequences is the laughter when you "get what's coming to you."      Have a polite day.|`|AA10025824	With all the pain you've caused her so far you should expect worse.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Women in generally find it somewhat amusing. It makes us even more happy to have all our "stuff" neatly tucked away.    I had to laugh at my son once. We were at an amusement park on a stand-up type ride, and he was on his tiptoes removing a wedgie when the harnesses were locked in. He had to be on tiptoe for the whole ride, or squash his nads!|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Since I answered this exact same question a few weeks ago and was sympathetic to you and explained your mom's reaction, I'll give you a different answer this time........ If YOU were my kid I would find this scenario hilarious.......|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Maybe your mother was laughing at what your sister said since it was so shocking. I would HOPE that she's not so sadistic that she would think it was actually funny you were hurt in that manner.  If she does think that is funny, then she needs counseling.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	It's called retribution.    Stop disobeying your mother.|`|WE6SxVS4aa	Maybe it wasn't the fact you got hurt that made your Mum laugh but how blunt your sister was. After the tense atmosphere created by her shouting at you it was just a complete change of scene.|`|TZz1uPY2aa	They probably figured it served you right for feeding the dog at the table, Against orders from you mom|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	I'll try to solve both problems for you.  It's not proper to feed your dog from the table or under the table.  The dog should have it's own dish and you should feed the dog before you sit down to dinner.  By feeding the dog under the table you are teaching him bad manners, and making the dog fat.  And a dog does not get all the nutrients from people food.  Dog food is made especially for what he needs.  Plus the dog could get all stopped up or otherwise.  Proper etiquette says you don't feed the dog from the table or under the table.    The second problem was that the dog was trying to get the bread which resulted in an injury.  Your mother and sister were laughing because you were paid back for not listening to your mom and not for any other reason.  Next time you'll know better and not feed the dog under the table.  The dog was only doing what it thought you wanted it to do (fight for its food).|`|C8FjJuTUaa	that was your clue to stop feeding the dog lol
pVDxOwUpaa	Absolutely. I would not say I am incredibly modest, but I just don't like compliments because they make me feel uncomfortable.

I've always been self-concious about my weight and i believed i was average if not OVER weight.  I felt this comment really drew attention to me, attention that i didnt want, and i worried people would use that comment to emphasize how untrue it was - how heavy i actually was.  I to this day don't get that comment - i was never "skinny" during HS.|`|XZTf8Eahaa	No i just say thank you.|`|i5RlIh88aa	Yes I do like when some one compliments about you in front of a total stranger it is really akward.|`|oYb4yC0jaa	ok, here comes the analogy: You're all dressed up, (jacket and tie) for the big date.

You can mention things like liability and toxins from their cars that might contaminate the land and harm your family and pets.  Since they are already avoiding you so as to pretend everything is fine as it is right now, you probably won't be able to avoid using your lawyer (and maybe even more then that)--you may have to have some sort of fence put in so they can't park there.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	The letter sounds like a good idea.

Are they bad neighbors otherwise?  Are they really hurting anything by parking there?      I would send them a letter stating that you would kindly prefer that they not park on your property.  Be nice about it.  If they still refuse to obey your wishes then when you see their vehicle parked on your land then call a tow truck and have it removed.  They might laugh at your letter, but seeing their Chevy hooked up behind a tow truck going past their house will make it known that you mean business.  You will have the last laugh!  You have a right to have it removed because it is not yours and they don't have permission to park there.  You might want to post a sign in that area first to warn them that they are in violation of private property.    It might be, as aggravating as it is, just better to allow them to park there vs starting a battle over a little bit of land.  You do have to live there and having neighbors that are ticked off at you may cause greater aggrivations.|`|QI74CxD0aa	Do you know how long they have been using that land?  Be careful about something called "adverse possession."   If they use it enough years they can go to court and claim they own it.    If they are running into their house when they see you approaching, that's an indication they don't want an honest discussion about this.     First put up a "No Trespassing" sign and some barriers which would prevent their parking there -- like big potted plants, cement blocks, etc.    You might also consider renting the parking space to someone else.|`|IxoazyHUaa	Go to their house and talk to them in person first and tell them you are sorry but they can no longer park on your property (or, if you want to charge them a fee, state the monthly charge, payable in advance).

If you need the money you could write them a letter (with date and your signature and make yourself a copy) say that you noticed they were parking on your land and that they seemed to like doing that so starting Feb 1 the cost of renting that space will be $____ per month due by Feb. 1 by hand delivery ($30 for a bounced check) to you for a six or twelve month lease and that if they don't feel that appropriate then please remove their car.  Make sure that letter is sent via certified mail return receipt (so that you will have a record of that if they take you to court, that's your proof).  Then after Feb. 1 you can place a sign on the property that any vehicles placed there will be towed at the owner's cost.  I've seen those kinds of signs and I'm not sure if you have to notify the police first or get a permit to put that sign up but you might want to check that out before putting up the sign.  Then if they park there again have the vehicle towed at their expense.

They sound like cowards you may be able to nip it in the bud if you got a lawyer to send them a letter stating just that. I mean not about taking legal action, but sometimes when people get a letter from a lawyer it scares them so they may be more likely to not do it.  Also maybe you may want to do something with the lot, like put a garden up or something constructive, that would be another way for them not to park on your land.|`|O1b7das7aa	As the other guy said, knock on the front door and TALK to them.

In some cities and states once someone is allowed to use a part of lets say their neighbors land lets say for parking after so many years (each state, city different) it becomes the neighbors land.    Ex.  If you let someone park on your land for lets say 10 years in some states they will then grant that part to your neighbor because you let him/her/them use it to park for 10years.    I know-Horrible law.  But it is true.|`|QPGyZEozaa	Definitely get that fence up, it's your property and they have no right to the use of it.  They can find elsewhere to park.

I find two things fascinating about Judaism. First, while someone can convert to Judaism, they have to want to on their own.  In other words, we're not allowed to proselytize to anyone to convince them to convert. Someone would have to have a deep love and desire to become Jewish before the rabbis would agree to the conversion. Second, while the bible overall doesn't focus on women a great deal the fact that Judaism gives such merit to women is unique. Let me offer a scenario to explain.  If a very pious Jewish man were to marry a non-Jew, no matter what his background or how many children he has, his children will not be Jewish unless they convert. Likewise, a Jewish woman who is not observant at all can marry anyone she wishes and their children will still be Jewish. I'm not necessarily making a point, I just find it interesting to look at it from that perspective.

5db661aa7c4e9f42fa8139651a98c24caa	If you will bear with me a moment, I can share something that will help you and Tony.    First of all, I have prayed for you both.  It seemed crucial to do that before responding.    Now, let me say this:  Do not rely on the "doctrine of agreement" to obtain Tony's healing.  The context of the Scriptures on agreement (Matthew 18:19) pertains to disciplinary action within the church.   It is the agreement of WITNESSES who either agree to forgive and retain the sinning brother who has repented, or whether they agree to release him from the protective covering of the church body to face the consequences of his actions with satan.     We see that agreement in action in 1 Corinthians 5, when the Apostle Paul instructs the church to excommunicate someone in the congregation who is having an incestuous relationship with his father's wife.    I'm correcting this mindset because you are talking about a potential life and death situation, so you need to be standing on something rock-solid, not the misinterpretations of men.      The fallacy of this doctrine of agreement is it teaches us to DO something in order to try and make God do something for us.  We're taught that if enough of us agree on something, then He'll have to do what we want.  That is spiritually dyslexic, and subtly teaches us to think that blessings have to be wrestled out of the hand of God.    HERE is the truth you and Tony can stand on:  Jesus Christ not only bore our sins and the punishment for our sins on that cross, but He bore our sorrows, pains, and sicknesses as well. (Just as Isaiah foretold in 53:4-8)  It isn't our agreement, our confession, or our own "great faith" which procurs healing.......it is His Word in our hearts, pregnant with the faith we need IN HIM AND THE WORK HE HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED FOR US!  We don't have to wonder if healing is His will for us, when Jesus has already purchased that for us on the cross.      Instead, we can wonder and marvel at the wisdom and richness of a God so loving that He has already provided everything we need from before the foundation of the world......It isn't that prayer changes God or procures the blessing as we've been taught.  Prayer is to make us more sensitive to Him and His heart for us....it changes us so we think less like men and more like Him. Prayer opens our eyes and our hearts to receive what is already lavishly given.    Encourage your friend to cultivate his relationship with Christ as never before....not to earn the blessing, but to intimately become acquainted with the Blessor.  THERE is the victory, and THERE is our faith....our personal and experiential knowledge of Him!      Tony needs to get into the Word and into prayer like never before.  If he is battling for his life, then he cannot get too much of either.    How do I know?    Through His Word and that living, personal relationship, my husband was delivered from YEARS of alcoholism.  My sister-in-law was healed of suicide and drug abuse.  I was physically healed of a tumor in my own body, and we were all born again through that living Word, which is Spirit and life.      If Tony spends one hour at the doctor's office or undergoing treatment of any kind, he should spend seven in the Word and in prayer.  I realize he has a life to lead and probably has work to do....but he can meditate on Jesus Christ and that written word as he goes about his daily work.  The same energy we use for worry and fear can be used to fix our gaze upon Him instead.    We were ALL delivered and healed through this means I'm sharing with you.  Again let me emphasize:  Not because we earned the blessing, but because we yielded ourselves to Him completely enough to be changed in our thinking and get the revelation we needed to receive the gift.      This is not a time to be natural minded, but to cultivate ourselves in Him, where every promise is yes and amen (instead of maybe), and the whole armor of God enables us to stand rock solid - even in the day of evil.    You and Tony are in my prayers - in Christ, Cassandra|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	OK|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Done!  God Bless.

Grant him Your fellowship and the fellowship of a caring and loving world.    Grant him Your all embracing love.   Grant him loyal and faithful family and friends.

I spent years in a church that taught us we had to live right to get God to hear our prayers.  They also taught that we had to tithe so God would bless us.  They ALSO taught us to watch our words very carefully so we wouldn't "jinx" a blessing.  (My word, not theirs, but that's pretty much the teaching)    I remember the day I figured out that God gives to us first and best.   I had finally been seeking Him for myself instead of doing all the work the church taught me to try and get close to Him.  At the time I was pretty sick and we didn't know what was going on.  I was scared and got desperate enough to get on my face and into my Bible.  He showed me some pretty important things.    The best thing He showed me was how I had been placing faith in my works and in my own faith, instead of putting it in Him.      It says in Proverbs 4:20-24 that God's word is the MEDICINE AND THE CURE to heal all our flesh.  Sister Cassandra may not have needed to try and "correct" a doctrine, but she is surely right about getting into that Bible 24/7!  And she is right that God has already given the means for Tony's healing.    It is our minds that need to change.  Spending time with Him is the only way we can do it.    I'll pray too!  God bless you for helping your friend.|`|40355f2998b78e1748916d4bed078e3caa	Beneficent Jon's prayer group are praying for you..  He asked us to come and stand with you..

They don't go after intelligent black women or intelligent women of other races either because they lack the confidence needed to be with a woman who is a rock and will be your lover, friend and backbone.  Proves why you have some black men who only date unattractive white or non black women with low self esteem that are not very desirable to men of their own race.  Black women are very loyal to black men and most black men are very loyal to black women.  Maybe you just aren't what the black women you go after prefer.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	Why are you making everything racial their just not into you which has nothing to do with race. It's about personality an connection. Don't act like no black woman has ever been attracted to you because I'm sure that isn't true.
GLzVJBpQaa	i really don't know myself. i like MEN, too, like you said. but the way i understand it is if a man looks like a woman, wants to be a woman, and doesn't have a penis or testicles, then he's a woman and if that woman likes men, i think they're "straight". i like being a boy, but i accept everybody.|`|ka6yGZWbaa	To put it simply if they are MTF & they are interested in men then they are straight, but if they are interested in woman then they are a lesbian.  If they are FTM & they are interested in woman then they are straight, but if they are interested in men then they are gay.  Hope that, that helps.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	I am a MTF transsexual and I consider my gender to be female but my sexual orientation is bi.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Sexual orientation is a separate issue. Post surgery, if the woman is attracted to the opposite sex, she is heterosexual. If she is attracted to other women, she is gay.    Transsexual people come in all sexual orientations, just like those of us who aren't transgendered.|`|65QqZBnjaa	Gender identity and sexual orientation are two wholly separate things.      To know a persons sexuality you must know how they identify gender-wise first.    If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and they attracted to men, they are straight.    If a person identifies as female, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are lesbian.    If a person identifies as male, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to women, they are straight.    If a person identifies as male, no matter their surgical status, and are attracted to men, they are gay.|`|le9ZROs5aa	If she likes men she is straight if she likes women she is a lesbian. Pretty simple if you ask me...|`|diCASlUXaa	If he's currently a woman, that makes him straight.    If he is currently a man, he's gay.    If he's half man half woman (process is partially completed), I guess it all depends on what he considers himself.      Maybe he might not fall into either category.|`|AA12006309	This question was asked earlier today.    You have to learn what their gender identity is, regardless of what their biological sex is.    If someone is biologically a man, and wants to transition to become a woman, she's a woman.  NOW you can figure out whether she's gay or straight based on her attraction.  If she is attracted to women, she is a lesbian.  If she is attracted to men, she's a heterosexual.    The status of your gender reassignment surgery (whether your pre-op or post-op) is irrelevant.  What's important is your presenting gender, your true gender identity, in determining your sexual orientation.    I hope this clarifies things for you.|`|3OZgcntfaa	Sexual orientation and gender aren't really related at all. Society has gender specific terms for certain orientations, but no real effect on the orientation itself.    A transwoman (men don't become women, transwomen transition to female bodies though) who likes men is straight. If she like other women, she is a lesbian. If she likes both she is bisexual.     Surgical status has no bearing on orientation either.    I'm a transman, I like boys and girls (and anyone in between I guess). When I am with someone who is male I am in a gay relationship. When I am with someone who is female, I am in a heterosexual relationship.    Makes sense right?
4LsF70cjaa	The food pantry, a hospital, a nursing home, the animal shelter, a day care center, an after school program for the elementary school.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	You'd have to contact the nursing home you're interested in to find out how old you'd have to be to volunteer there.  You may be able to volunteer at a younger age at an assisted living since the residents wouldn't be as frail. I hope it works out for you because the people would love to have the attention you'd give them.|`|uImRBRpNaa	try the town lake animal shelter, food bank, salvation army and  your church should have a list of thing you can do  there is all kind of places you can volunteer at

It has to do with valueing human life. I would save the BABY, because it's a human life, and to me more valubale than a kitten. Granted, I would turn the child over to social services, because the baby shouldn't have been in the street to begin with.<br>  <br>  And please don't attack me telling me that a kitten is more important than a human. Because I am all for animal rights, but I have priorities, and as an EMT focus on human life over any other.|`|bMVJkCShaa	I would choose to save the cat for several reasons:<br>  <br>  a) Cats don't f**k up the planet as much as humans<br>  b) Cats don't create religion to cause issues with each other<br>  c) Cats have respect for themselves and each other<br>  d) Cats are very smart, spiritual creatures<br>  e) Babies smell<br>  <br>  lol...

iY6GQsRUaa	Because it had a bigger impact, both symbolically and strategically as it happened. The U.S. is founded on Masonic principles, of which the twin towers (Masonic Pillars) and the Pentagon (Venusian Pentagram) are central symbols. Couple that with a defense nexus and financial nexus, and you have the purpose of terrorism: to asymmetrically terrorize a large population.<br>  <br>  Further note: Masons are widely considered to be the inheritors of The Knights Templar, the original Crusaders. Thus, there was a vengeful component as well.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	Well, yes, killing the infidels--a large body count--was their true objective.  And as someone else pointed out, hitting the broad side of a building is also far easier and more likely to cause damage than hitting a relatively thin statue.<br>  <br>  My understanding is the fourth plane was headed for either the White House or Congress, which would have been another devastating blow after the financial centers and defense centers were attacked.  Fortunately, that plot was foiled, as the passengers learned of the attacks on the WTC and Pentagon as they called to say goodbye to their families.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself this: Which would scare and demoralize you more, the destruction of a monument with a relatively low loss of life; or the destruction of two buildings and damage to a third with relatively major loss of life?|`|e6brEEbOaa	That is right of course.  I have been to the statue of liberty and there is no way that you could have over 3000 people in that thing at one time let alone be able to kill all of them with one plane.<br>  <br>  No, the root word of terrorist is terror.  They strive to kill as many unassuming helpless people as you possibly can to achieve as much domestic social fear and economic chaos as possible.  The more helpless the victim the better.<br>  <br>  They are cowards that prey upon the idealism of youth. They take a child, fill them with hatred, and convince them to through their lives away by slaughtering people who are more compassionate than themselves in an effort to kill compassion itself.<br>  <br>  An evil endeavor to be sure.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	To be a terrorist you have to install a sense of terror.   That comes from body counts.<br>  <br>  This has been true for all terrorist that I am aware of apart from one group.   The IRA campaign on the British mainland.   The IRA realised that killing English people in England actually made people less sympathetic to them in America, where their funding came from.   So they  would target civilian locations, but give sufficient warning that the police could evacuate, but not long enough to risk being able to find the bomb and defuse it before it went off.|`|373KJjiOaa	Because terrorism is, by definition, the attempt to terrorize people. By increasing the death count as much as possible, they were attempting to terrorize the US. Unfortunately for them, it didn't work that way.|`|QuaVnaOEaa	The idea is to kill  the "infidel",  the unbeliever, people....as many as they can because Allah said it was the right thing to do.........I myself mourn people who have died rather than a statue blown to smithereens.....|`|v61VWKMDaa	I can't believe people don't understand this.  The World Trade Center was the hub of multinational commerce.  The body count wasn't their target.<br>  <br>  The attack was much more about lasting effects to our ecomomy than just "lets kill a bunch of people".|`|8I9uduIiaa	There aren't thousands of people working in the statue of Liberty.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Islamic terrorists chose the trade centre very deliberately, as they wanted to cause maximum carnage.|`|VbP8YWonaa	I believe it would not leave a big enough impact on peoples lives to serve the purpose for what they wanted to accomplish. Terrorism.|`|AA11203798	are you kiddin, heh heh heh, whats a chunk of concrete knocked down gonna state, ?? nah, shooda hit the wite huse, after dey as all gon ome for dere tea man, heh, heh, heh .|`|AA10239241	Their "true" objective was to target the world's financial markets which they did.|`|IqPB4QTgaa	Body count and because they profited from investments in the stock markets. Millions were made that day.|`|IYe1TTwYaa	They were out to kill people not make a political statement.|`|lkJ1M01Uaa	Maybe the world trade centers were easier to damage/hit.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Its an economic war. Which is what we taught them in the 80's in Afghanistan. The best way to take a super power down is win the war economically. An example would be shooting down a 20 million dollar plane with a 20 thousand dollar missile.|`|AA10192697	The Statue doesn't have people working in it and the towers were a power. They had many businesses in them and more people than the statue.<br>  <br>  Plus the statue is from France as a peace treaty. It isn't as important politically, economically as the towers were.|`|zkETPA8waa	To be pragmatic about it, what do you think is easier to hit; a thin statue or a pair of really big, wide towers? And hey, they were looking to kill as many as possible.<br>  <br>  Simon T: The IRA didn't always give details. They tried to blow up the Prime Minister without warning at one point, and while I'll admit a lot of people hoped they would actually succeed that one time (joking!), saying they always gave warnings is incredibly naive. They killed plenty of people.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	what causes more FEAR!!! an old statue, or hundred of lives in the middle of new york?|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Death to infidels was their primary objective.|`|NR4hbYPiaa	It was carefully planned to occur at a time and location which would cause maximum loss of life.|`|VKXNWcbGaa	Because they were not after the statue of Liberty that symbolized freedom, they wanted to attack the economy of the us and their  polocies in the Middle East.<br>  I am a Muslim and I fully condem the actions of thoese terrorists. They did nothing in the name of religion, infact they went against their own teachings. The Prophet said that when you go to war do not harm inicent civilians, don't harm the chilldron, don't harm woman, non-combatives, or the elderly, and even not to cut down green trees or harm the living things (like plants, trees, etc) witch are alive.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	The three largest office buildings in the world on the morning of September 11, 2001 were the Pentagon and the two towers of the World Trade Center.  It is no coincidence that these were the targets.<br>  <br>  Just a thought:  Many a battle plan, e.g. Pearl Harbor, or Tarawa, has been undermined by the planners failure to properly account for time zone differences.  The fourth plane on 9-11 was well situated to strike the Sears Tower in Chicago but its arrival would have been one hour later than the coordinated attacks on the Pentagon and WTC 1&2;  but on a flight schedule that one hour difference would not be apparent as Chicago was on CDT while New York and Washington were on EDT, a one hour difference.  Makes me wonder if there were other targets in the central U.S. and the West coast that day that were spared by a mistake.|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	The Statue of Liberty? <br>  a. Too small a target<br>  b. Let's face it, the Americans have targeted the statue of liberty long before 911. Do you really believe the statue of liberty is more representative of the current american values than the WTC? C'mon, we're not in 2nd grade anymore! :-)|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	Larry Silverstein hadn't insured it for terrorist attack, and nobody wanted to demolish it on the cheap.<br>  <br>  Edit, sorry I forgot to add that you are indeed an idiot, not even funny tastelessness.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	If i really want to scare you, I'm not going to go for less of a body count, i'm going for maximum carnage. The WTC was an economic hub. So yes, a massive body count is what they were going after.|`|9onFys4baa	You idiot.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	The WTC was a symbol of capitalism, which they are against.|`|gmaCvh00aa	I'm pretty sure the body count was the objective.  Besides, they threatened to take out the WTC so many times that if they'd gone to the Statue instead at that point it would have looked like they wimped out to their followers.<br>  <br>  Deis above me, Larry Silverstein lost money on the attacks--he had to give back the Freedom Tower, didn't he?  And now he can't even finish the towers he is committed to.  I hate when people fall for the conspiracy site misinformation without checking any facts.  Please don't be one of the non-thinkers who believes that it was suspicious that the net lease required SPI to take out terrorist insurnace on a known terrorist target.  THINK, people, THINK.<br>  <br>  --- I'm not a guy, but how would you know that.  It's in the public record, but of course if you are also of the mindset that all the newspapers are also lying to cover this up, I cannot help you.  I know this stuff through my job, not the press, but again, I cannot prove to you what I do or what I know.  I am familiar with what the CT sites say--they all seem to have one source, because they all contain the same misinformation.  In all likelihood you also believe that the federal government controlled the cleanup so completely that hundreds of non-federal engineers who escaped from the building, lost family members and coworkers and went back to work on the recovery are scared of losing their jobs and so willingly lied for George Bush about what they saw, or more accurately, didn't see.  You probably also believe that the steel was all sold off without being examined because that's what the CT sites will tell you.  Most of the real engineers just laugh at the CT nuts, but I get angry because they are abusive to the families of the dead on the anniversary when the CTs gather for their little attention-fest down here, calling them liars as well.  I've seen this myself, every year.  Here's a clue for you--go find a CT site that DOESN'T have a place to click to donate or buy the DVD.  If you are interested in real life, check out the link below.  If not, have a party supporting Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas and the others who have taken you all for suckers.

Just because you choose an occupation for money doesn't mean that you have to give up on your dreams.|`|xbISxnmfaa	No please dont become a History teacher, I thought about being a teacher for awhile and I did my research. Teachers that teach History are NOT needed unless you want to teach at the college level then thats okay to be a history professor. Other than that the teachers that are REALLY needed are science, math, and special education teachers.  How about you work on becoming a singer and if that doesnt work out you can always go to college to become a teacher.

h6NUE6VTaa	Each 250 ml can of Red Bull contains the following:<br>   <br>  Medicinal ingredients:      <br>  Ingredient Amount<br>       <br>  Taurine <br>  An amino acid, taurine is important in several metabolic processes of the body. Also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. Taurine functions in electrically active tissues such as the brain and heart to help stabilize cell membranes. It also has functions in the gallbladder, eyes, and blood vessels and may have some antioxidant and detoxifying properties. 1000 mg <br>       <br>  Glucuronolactone<br>  A naturally occurring substance manufactured by the human body. Like taurine, glucuronolactone is supposed to detoxify the body. Little research has been done on the effects, and the only relevant studies have been conducted on animals so the risk to humans cannot be adequately assessed. Glucuronolactone has received some notoriety due to rumours that it was a Vietnam War era drug manufactured by the American government and led to several brain tumour deaths at the time. These rumours are not based on documented facts. 600 mg <br>       <br>  Caffeine<br>  An alkaloid found naturally in such foods as coffee beans, tea, kola nuts, Yerba maté, guarana, and (in small amounts) cacao beans. 80 mg <br>       <br>  Niacin (niacinamide)<br>  Also known as nicotinic acid or vitamin B3, niacin is a water-soluble vitamin whose derivatives such as NADH play essential roles in energy metabolism in the living cell. Severe lack of niacin causes the deficiency disease pellagra, whereas a mild deficiency slows down the metabolism, which in turn decreases cold tolerance and is a potential contributing factor towards obesity.  18 mg<br>        <br>  Pantothenic acid (calcium d-pantothenate)<br>  An antioxidant, water-soluble vitamin needed to break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It is found in whole grain cereals, legumes, eggs, meat and other foods. 6 mg<br>        <br>  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxide HCI)<br>  A water-soluble vitamin that exists in three major chemical forms: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. Vitamin B6 performs a wide variety of functions in your body – for example, protein and red blood cell metabolism. The nervous and immune systems also require vitamin B6 to function efficiently and it is also needed for the conversion of tryptophan (an amino acid) to niacin (see above). 2 mg <br>       <br>  Riboflavin<br>  Also known as vitamin B2, riboflavin is an easily absorbed, water-soluble micronutrient with a key role in maintaining human health. Like the other B vitamins, it supports energy production by aiding in the metabolizing of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins and can be found in milk, cheese, leafy green vegetables, liver, yeast, almonds and mature soybeans. 1.65 mg <br>       <br>  Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamine)<br>  Helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells, and needed for the production of DNA, the genetic material in all cells. Deficiency of vitamin B12 is the cause of several forms of anaemia. Also called 'cobalamin' because it contains the metal cobalt.  1 mcg      <br>  (Sources: Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Journal of Chromatographic Science, Journal of Biochemistry, Wikipedia)      <br>  Non-medicinal ingredients:       <br>  Carbonated water        <br>  Sucrose        <br>  Glucose        <br>  Citric acid        <br>  Inositol        <br>  Flavours        <br>  Caramel       <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/health/redbull/ingredients.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull#Ingredients" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull#In...</a><br>  so i think Red Bull is just an energizing drink|`|mxixfE3Raa	No it's not true.

1vMaJqaQaa	yeah, the shite iru form just shows that it is happening as we speak  he is doing    whereas suru shows that it happens, not necessarily at the moment  he does    both are also applicable to future:  he will be doing  he will do    for shita vs. shite ita,   shite ita = he was doing  shita = he did    the iru style just shows it is progressive. as for if it is future or present, you just have to use external words/phrases, or here is a helpful way:    suru tsumori desu = he/you/i intend to do, in the future. (i will do)  suru tokoro desu = i am about to do    each shows it will happen in the future, but not in as plain a style as jus 'i will do'.     hope that helps|`|AA11928403	Loche answered and explained correctly.  As I being a native Japanese, just want to help you with Japanese future tense.  As you  said Japanese doesn't have future tense the same way English does.  Our future tense is made by adding external words(include verbs and nouns) and joshi(- particles).  Here are the words we use for the future tense:  e.g.  I will play tennis.  a) (I intend/or am intending to play tennis.  b) (I am thinking of playing tennis.)  c) /(I plan/or am planig to play tennis.)  d) (I am just about to play tennis.)    Suru is used the same way as English:  e.g.    a)  I play tennis.  b)  I play tennis everyday( every Friday, once in a while, sometimes, often, occasionally, and so on).    Shita is a simple past tense as in Engish did.  e.g. (with yesterday, last Friday, and so on)    We use past progressive as these terms:  e.g. I was playing  tennis.  a) (I was playing tennis.)  b) (I was playing tennis just now. - immediate past.) This is often used with  or.    Johnny san,  you might be having a little difficulties with particles.  You know particles are the ones of major problems for gaikokujin.  If you study particles, Japanese will become easier.  I really recommend getting a book called "Gaikuku-jin no tame no joshi () published in Tokyo by Musashino Shoin ().  I also recommend (Chino Naoko)'s books.    Please go to this site and check about many Japanese books and a lot of good stuff about Japanese language.  I am sure you like this site.  http://www.thejapanesepage.com/  Edit   I sent you the beginner's site, i didn't mean to send that because I know you are not a beginner.  You can go many sites from there but I just go ahead and sent home site now.|`|9X4MS2uxaa	If it is a habit or a job or a present state, you should use shiteiru.  maishuu kinyoubi ni tenisu wo shiteimasu.  watashi wa kyoushi wo shiteimasu.  taiyou wa kumo ni kakureteimasu.  I think suru mustn't be used if it is such a case.    But as for a habit, maybe they(we) often use both shiteiru and suru.  maiasa roku-ji ni okiteimasu[okimasu]    If I hear shiteiru, I can confirm it is just the habit.  If I hear suru, I can think that it is the future event and maybe it is also the habit.  Because, "maishuu kinyoubi" or "maiasa" can be clue that it is the habit.  You can think about shita and shiteita like that.    I just think suru mustn't be used if it is such a case.  But I don't know. Sorry.|`|AA10948829	Tenisu o shimasu vs tenisu o shiteimasu = I play tennis vs I am playing tennis.    It's the same as in Japanese.  Maishuu no kinyoubi, tenisu o shimasu.

"… On sitting in the second Raka'h he sat on his left foot and propped up the right one; and in the last Rak'ah he pushed his left foot forward and kept the other foot propped up and sat over the buttocks" [Reported by Imam al-Bukhari ]. <br>  There is a narration in all the books of Sunan save the Sunan of al-Nasa'i that reads: "In the last Raka'h of the prayers he would spread his left foot out under him and sat on his buttocks before finishing the prayer with Salaam" .<br>  The above Hadith is an evidence for sitting on his buttocks in the last Raka'h of the prayer of four Raka'h. The same ruling applies to the prayer of three Raka'h like al-Maghrib. Sitting on the left foot in Salah other than the above is proved from the above-mentioned Hadith and also from the Hadith of Wa'el bin Hujr that he observed the Prophet's (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) prayer and said: "He (the Prophet) prostrated and then sat down on his left foot" [ Ahmad , Abu Dawood al-Tirmizi and al-Nasa'i ].

In 1997, 49 percent of Blacks and 76 percent of Whites felt Blacks were treated the same as Whites. However, in 2001 the percentages were 41 percent of Blacks and 69 percent of Whites. "There's always been a divergence, but both Whites and Blacks have actually become a little less positive now compared to 1997," said Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll.<br>  <br>  The 2001 poll also found that 55 percent of Blacks and 22 percent of Whites said Blacks were treated not very well or badly.<br>  <br>  Newport pointed out that the gap in the way Blacks and Whites saw education was the widest in 2001. Forty-six percent of Blacks felt Black children didn't have as good a chance as White children to get a good education, while only 13 percent of Whites felt that way about the plight of Black children.<br>  <br>  When it came to housing, 48 percent of Blacks felt that Blacks have the same opportunity to get any housing they can afford while 83 percent of Whites felt that way.<br>  <br>  In the area of personal discrimination, almost three in 10 Blacks said they were treated unfairly while shopping in the last 30 days; one in five felt they were discriminated against in a restaurants bar, theater or other entertainment venues.

We have millions of years to do it!<br>  <br>  BTW, the Bible writers created God!!!|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	During ancient times, people were very primitive and uneducated and feared many things that they didn't understand like lightning and thunder.  Elders created a third party and called it God and said that it all came from him.  Thunder meant that God was angry because you were bad. It helped keep the people quiet, just like religion does today.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	"religion is the main reason why a lot of wars are fought too. if no one was religious wouldn't there be a lot less fighting?"<br>  <br>  Actually, people are the cause of wars. The great wars of the 19th and 20th centuries had nothing to do with religion, and those wars killed far more people than all other wars combined.|`|9onFys4baa	Humans did!<br>  <br>  It's like a natural/supernatural 69er.|`|AU3mZG1zaa	Just like scientists believe that the universe was just a buch of gases at first and nobody knows how they came into being, just like that God was not given birth by anyone. Humans in general are too stupid to actually find out God's secret, our brains are too small. <br>  Secondly, God is not a guy, he is not any one gender, he is unique and thus God...If He called himself a female, then people would say that, "why does She calls herself a female not a male?" Since that is how it works for humans: male or female. We cant call him "it" either because he is living.<br>  <br>  Then you asked the origin of Bible; as by Christians, the Bible is written by Jesus and it is actually God's own words. In other religions, they believe that their Prophets wrote their sacred books and they are the words of God.<br>  Just like someone else said; it is humans/people whi cause the wars not religions, it is their fault that they cannot respect each other's beliefs.<br>  <br>  Also, there had to be some logical reason for a process for giving birth and carrying the human generation forward. Therefore, males are on the other hand (most of the time) making money for their family and protecting them and taking care of them. Women take care of kids because usually women can do that stuff betten than men can...<br>  Glad you asked this question....XD|`|BDSC8R3Aaa	Well, God is eternal.

It is politics|`|HbCWNCQzaa	no one created GOD he was always there....GOD is like a perfect circle...there is no beginning or end to a perfect circle|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	God is energy and energy cannot be created or destroyed it just changes form|`|bMVJkCShaa	I did!<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|AA11466757	Mama and Papa God|`|kCUpmYrBaa	yes God created us, but, well, he has just always been there!|`|oen1tuyTaa	Me or perhaps Rev Soleil...he looks like a cool creator|`|JCGtfNeTaa	That is a good question. Let's take a look.<br>  <br>  >so like if he created us and the<br>  >and everything, who created him?<br>  <br>  We know that we are not eternal. In other words, we recognize that we have a beginning, we did not always exist. We recognize that we have a birthday. We were created.<br>  <br>  But just because *we* are created, does not mean that *everything* is created.<br>  <br>  >did he just appear? why couldnt the<br>  >world have just appeared then?<br>  <br>  No, God did not suddenly appear. Science has shown us that something cannot come from nothing, nothing ever has, nothing ever could. This is the superstitious believe of "Spontaneous Generation". People used to believe that things like mosquitoes would suddenly appear out of absolute nothing; this was before we had microscopes. But we know that Spontaneous Generation is false; although proponents of evolution would like us to believe that the universe sprang from nothing, but this violates the laws of science.<br>  <br>  Any given object is either created, or self-existent.<br>  <br>  Science has demonstrated that the universe has not always existed. Science has shown that the universe had a beginning in the finite past.<br>  <br>  God, on the other hand, has always existed. There never was a time that God did not exist.<br>  <br>  <br>  >plus god is a guy so he gave women<br>  >all the bad things, like period and birth<br>  >and all that other **** that guys dont<br>  >have to do.<br>  <br>  No, God is not male as in a sexual gender. Neither does God have some sort of personal vendetta against the female gender, as if He was inflicting bad things upon the females just to satisfy some sadistic pleasure.<br>  <br>  Do you realize that females typically live longer than males? Would that mean that God hates the male gender?<br>  <br>  No, God does not hate neither the females nor the males. God made MANKIND (both male and female) in His image.<br>  <br>  The fact that men die sooner than women, and that women have periods and painful childbirth, and so on, is a result of sin in this world. It was mankind that brought sin into this world, not God. God is not trying to torture us with these inflictions, but we have brought it upon ourselves by sinning.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, God is working to save us from our sin, and one day He is coming back soon and He will destroy sin forever, and there will be no more crying, sickness, pain, or death.<br>  <br>  <br>  >and for the bible.. who wrote it?<br>  <br>  "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." 2 Timothy 3:16. "Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21. "The scripture cannot be broken." John 10:35.<br>  <br>  The 66 books of the Bible was written over a period of about 1500 years on 3 different continents, in 3 languages, by about 40 different people (kings, shepherds, scientists, attorneys, an army general, fishermen, priests, and a physician) who in most cases never met each other.<br>  <br>  The Bible does not contradict itself, and is in complete agreement about the various topics that it covers. This is amazing in itself, as you cannot get even fewer than 40 people to agree on things.<br>  <br>  Yet the Bible reads as if it was written by one great mind; and, in fact, it was written by one great mind. "Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:2<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit is the true Author of the Bible.<br>  <br>  >did god or jesus write it and someone<br>  >just magically found it and said this is<br>  >the way to live?<br>  <br>  No, it was not magically found. It was written by about 40 authors from various backgrounds over a period of 1500 years, written as they were inspired by the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  <br>  >religion is the main reason why<br>  >a lot of wars are fought too. if no<br>  >one was religous wouldnt there<br>  >be a lot less fighting?<br>  <br>  No, there would not be any less fighting. Remember, we live in a fallen world, and all the evil is a result of the sin in this world. Religion is not the cause of evil in this world; but sin is the cause.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of car thefts in this country. Would there be less theft in this country if we had no cars? No, people would just steal other things. The problem is not the cars, but the evil in the hearts of men. This bad heart condition (evil in the heart) is why we have car thefts, and is why we have fighting and wars.<br>  <br>  Cars is not the problem, and neither is religion. The problem is sin.<br>  <br>  But God has overcome sin and evil, and He invites you to be part of His family, and one day soon He will destroy sin and evil forever.<br>  <br>  Are you ready for that day?|`|6ce4d037b7513657500609aad855ffdcaa	no one created God.

In fact, not a few question even the existence of God. In today’s age of materialism many feel: How can I believe in someone I’ve never seen?<br>  <br>  IS IT LOGICAL TO BELIEVE ONLY WHAT YOU CAN SEE?<br>  <br>  Many persons say, ‘Yes.’ However, have you ever seen the wind? Because of what you see it do, whether it causes the branches of a tree to wave gently or sends them twisting and breaking to the ground, you are convinced that the wind exists. The same is true of electricity. You can see what it does—it lights your house or keeps your milk cold in the refrigerator—yet it is invisible.<br>  <br>  There are many things that we cannot see. But the existence of these is not denied, because we can see, feel and hear the activity or the results of these things.<br>  <br>  BUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT GOD REALLY EXISTS?<br>  <br>  Since God cannot be seen, we must reason on his existence by looking at things around us that we can see. Consider our own bodies.<br>  <br>  Our BRAIN is a supercomputer without equal in all the earth. “The brain,” reports one authority, “sorts one hundred million bits of data from the eyes, ears, nose and other sensory outposts each second .?.?. A computer capable of handling a single brain’s output would cover the entire earth.”<br>  <br>  Our EYES have been described as natural cameras. They are perfect self-cleaning, self-focusing “cameras” that take three-dimensional pictures in living color.<br>  <br>  Our VOCAL CORDS can produce not only speech but some of the most beautiful music to delight the human ear. The melodies that the human voice can produce have a beauty far excelling that of a finely tooled violin.<br>  <br>  The electrical wiring of an automobile is most primitive when compared with our NERVOUS SYSTEM. This vast network transmits information to and from scores of our vital organs with an efficiency that dazzles scientists.<br>  <br>  You personally may not have seen the maker of a computer, a camera, a violin or the electrical system of a car, yet you know that the designer of each did exist. His handiwork testifies to his existence and skill. Since no one will hesitate to say that each of these fine inventions had a designer and maker, is it not obvious that no less could be said of our body? “In a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made,” observed a wise king over 3,000 years ago.—Ps. 139:14.<br>  <br>  Yes, there is a loving Designer of our bodies who is also the Creator of the entire universe. However, in spite of such logical reasoning, some persons will still say that there is no God.<br>  <br>  WHY DO SOME STILL DENY THE EXISTENCE OF GOD?<br>  <br>  There is a variety of reasons. The majority have doubts because of the following questions:<br>  <br>  □ How could God exist when there is so much wickedness on earth?<br>  <br>  □ Would belief in God restrict my lifestyle and take all the fun out of living?<br>  <br>  □ What about the hypocrisy among those who profess to believe in God?<br>  <br>  □ Is not such belief unscientific and old-fashioned?<br>  <br>  Such questions need answering.<br>  <br>  WHERE CAN REASONABLE ANSWERS BE FOUND?<br>  <br>  A Nobel Prize winner in the field of science stated: “An orderly unfolding universe testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered—‘In the beginning God’.” He was quoting the opening words of the “world’s best-seller,” the Bible—Gen. 1:1.<br>  <br>  Though it is not a textbook on science, the Bible contains scientific knowledge far superior to what was known during the period of its writing. Because of this, and for other reasons, many persons are convinced that this book was inspired by God and therefore is his communication to mankind.—2?Tim. 3:16.<br>  <br>  The Bible gives satisfying answers to the aforementioned questions. Its answers reflect a wise and loving Creator who has in mind the lasting good of his creatures. From time to time, “Awake!” magazine discusses these and shows why the Bible’s answers draw a person to God and give hope and meaning to life.<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s Witnesses are eager to help you to find these answers in your Bible. Free of charge, they will help you to build your confidence not only in God’s existence but also in his ability to solve permanently the many problems that now distress our earth. Gladly they will show you why they are convinced that God is the Rewarder of all “those earnestly seeking him.”—Heb. 11:6.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|oJ2bwej9aa	If you really want to know the truth read the book of John.<br>  <br>  In the beginning was the Word and the word was with God and the Word was God.<br>  <br>  The real God is mysterious. The Bible was written by man through the Inspiration of the Holy Spirit. That is how God reveals Himself through language, word's so He can reach everybody in a simple way. He has even taught a woman who could not read and she can read only the Bible!<br>  <br>  Anyway, the teacher is the Holy Spirit Himself and you will need Him to read his word, that comes through Salvation in Christ Jesus and being Born Again.|`|rBzTgXwbaa	Time is a dimension just like space. If God created time and space, then God would transcend both and God would exist without a beginning or ending. Granted, we can not fully comprehend existence without time just as we can not comprehend infinity, but that doesn’t mean that such a higher level of reality does not exist. What’s really hard to believe is the idea that the timeline is infinite in both directions. It is difficult to explain existence without the existence of some higher level or “timeless dimension” which is the source of our universe including time. The question is does this timeless dimension contain or consist of intellect and emotion (God) or is it lifeless (no God). With the ordered nature of the universe, I would say that God exists, but that’s just my opinion.<br>  <br>  God is not a guy. There are advantages and disadvantages to both genders. There are advantages and disadvantages in having the ability to give birth. But the grass is always greener, right?<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by many people over a long period of time. Even religious people don’t deny this, but they do claim that the authors of the Bible were inspired by God. That is what is in dispute.<br>  <br>  War and violence are caused by a number of factors. Topping the list would be economics, but violence also comes from intolerant fanaticism. Fanaticism can be inspired by religion, nationalism, political ideology, or anything else a person might believe in. One question is, does the fanaticism come from the belief system of the fanatic or does it come from the fanatic’s nature or environment? Is bin Laden a fanatic by nature, such that if Islam did not exist, would bin Laden simply become a fanatic about something else? The truth is probably somewhere in between. If you eliminate or remove all religion in the world, you might produce a slight reduction in violence, but I don’t believe you would get anywhere near the reduction in violence that critic of religion believe.<br>  <br>  Economic and greed have always played a dominant role when it comes to war, both directly and indirectly. Economics even plays a role when it comes to the production of fanatics and their supporters.

One is to meditate. Do visualization to build your image memory. Do breathing to remain calm adn to develop attention and discipline.     Practice shileding.     Ground. A good method for a complete grounding is a bath in water with epsom salt, sea salt, and baking soda. This evens out your energies.     Keep a small battery operated reading light, pen or pencil, and a blank pad of paper or journal by your bed. When you wake with a dream, record as much as you can. Next morning, enter any related information you are aware of, note the date and time of the dream. When something happens, record what happened, and how the dream fits it. Analyze the similarities and differences. This will help you to learn just HOW your dreams work.     As a balance, also be sure to pray, keep up a balanced social life, Laugh, live, have a real life. Keep balance in your life. Avoid all addictions. I am not sure what the pitfals of clairvoyance is, but keep an eye on your habits.     Feel free to email me if you need any further ideas.

mOWyzwubaa	The word "ALLAH"     A Comment by : Abu Iman Robert Squires     The word "ilah" in Arabic can be used for a false god or for Allah. (Like when God says (paraphrased) the "ilah" of Ibrahim", and numerous other example.) Anyone who can read the Quran should know this. However, unlike the word "god" in English, which ALWAYS implies a false god. Non-native English speakers sometimes mistakenly believe that "god" and "God" are the same English word, but they are not. They carry completely different meanings. If they doubt this, then they simply don't know how to speak the English language. And to say that the word "Allah" can only be used for the Supreme Almighty Creator is refuted by the Quran itself.     God of the Arabic Bible is called "Allah". I do not think you believe that there is a god for the English Bible and another god for the Arabic Bible and a third for the Italian bible...etc. It would be too naive.     There is ONLY one God. His name in English is God, in French: un dieu, in Italian: dio, in German: Gott, in Spanish: Dios, in Portuguese: Deus, in Arabic: Allah, and in Aramaic : alaha.     All these are no more than the names of God in different languages To this day the Christian Arabs pray to Allah and talk about Allah. They called Him Allah even before Islam was born and they know they were not worshipping any moon god. Those who still speak Jesus language (Aramaic/syriac) call God alaha to this day like Jesus did. Jesus did not pray to a moon god but to alaha (Allah), the One and Only God.     The Arabic Bible, use the word Allah for God. If you want any images of the Arabic Bible with the word Allah in it (for God of the Bible), please let me know.     If you want to verify it, call any Arabic church in the USA or any English speaking country and ask them what they call God in their Arabic Bible and whether they still use the word Allah in their Bible or not.     Jewish Arabs also pray to Allah and talk about Allah just like an English person talks about God.|`|Eo7qRPJyaa	It has importance about lunar calendar in Islam...

"Allah had no Son"|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Well, most will tell you that it is because Muslims follow the lunar calendar...    Of course, you may want to look way back in history to see why that is.    Some scholars have said:    The god Il or Ilah was originally a phase of the Moon God, but early in Arabian history the name became a general term for god, and it was this name that the Hebrews used prominently in their personal names, such as Emanu-el, Israel, etc., rather than the Ba'al of the northern Semites proper, which was the Sun. Similarly, under Mohammed's tutelage, the relatively anonymous Ilah became Al-Ilah, The God, or Allah, the Supreme Being. (C. S. Coon, "Southern Arabia, A Problem For The Future", Papers Of The Peabody Museum Of American Archaeology And Ethnology, 1943, Volume 20, p. 195)    Allah. Islamic name for God. Is derived from Semitic El, and originally applied to the moon; he seems to have been preceded by Ilmaqah, the moon god. ("Allah" in E. Sykes, Everyman's Dictionary Of Non-Classical Mythology [J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd., London, E. P. Dutton & Co. Inc., New York, 1961] p. 7)    Sufism is for the more "open-minded" and spiritual...    Conservative "salafi da'wa" Islam is typically not so accepting... because the spirit is so much more difficult to control than the mind and body. :)    EDIT: @ MUhammad K...    Actually, the Bible has a name for God--YHWH, which is roughly translated "I AM who I AM."  In the Bible it says YHWH is God.  Not "God" is God.  "Hayah" is the shortened version (according to some scholars)...meaning I AM...and likely used by Christ, which is why the teachers of the law wanted to stone him.    "The name Yahweh appears to be a finite causative verb from the Northwest Semitiv root hwy, which means 'to be, to come into being' which would mean that the divine name would mean 'He causes to be, or exist,' i.e. 'He creates.' Apparently Amorite personal names after 2000 BC lend support to this Haupt-Albright view, 'demonstrating that the employment of the causative stem yahweh was in vogue in the liguistc background of early Hebrew.' "  Source: Ungers Bible Dictionary p1375.     "YHWH and Elohim are both Major Names of the Divine Creator in the Hebrew Bible.  God is a noun.  But Yahweh is a verb.  Elohim, although a noun as well, alludes to a greater holistic unity by dint of the fact that it is a plural noun that nevertheless takes only singular adjectival and verb forms in the Tanach.  Elohim is therefore One.  Not One of Many.  But the One that includes All." http://twelvetribetorah.org/History_Name...|`|d1i3ac5baa	the moon god ,allah was worshiped in the kaa'ba for thousands of years before mohammad invented islam. all the customs worship today are from the worshiping of the moon god allah.|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	i am a Muslim, but i believe the moon sign is just made up, it isn't really the islamic sign.|`|f19d1fa408561dbd2277d20975d7f605aa	Muslims follow the lunar calendar.

Historically, it had significance for the tribe to which Muhammad belonged. Arab Bedouins focused on the moon, for provided light for their grazing flocks at night. Today, it is important because Islam maintains a lunar calendar, and Ramadan is regulated by the rising of the moon.    Also, some Muslims consider Sufism heretical. In Islam, there is a focus on both the transcendence ("otherness") and the immanence (closeness) of Allah. While traditional Islam focuses primarily on the otherness of God, and hence His innate separation from creation, Sufism emphasizes the immanence of God. Hence, it becomes a mystic form of the religion focused on experiencing God. Many Muslims believe that this puts God heretically close to creation, and so limits His supreme nature.|`|lGqWWSZ6aa	The moon is only important for the Muslims because its appearance marks the start of the new month.

We only worship the One True Almighty Allah.|`|1WOY8ewMaa	Because they warship the spacemonster who live on the dark side of the moon.|`|f1vr6bMpaa	Sorry I dont know.|`|kJ7tmwE6aa	um im not sure.    i wear the moon and star on my necklace.. & im Islamic.|`|ZMzZ8H0Waa	cant you ask your parents if not.... good luck|`|f6851264bc5d56ceb1264b29ddb15bddaa	uhmm i guess it's a religionn  it tells in bible, uhm ur muslim? KOran yeahhj lol|`|DA7aRSMraa	the moon is not a symbol for islam. They have this holiday called ramadan. the moon tells them when to start ramadan and when ramadan ends. Ramadan is a holiday which they fast for a month and eat when the sun goes down every day.|`|xuZ2y3ADaa	i fink cause the we follow the lunar calender u noe what i mean cool|`|Vz3F1uw3aa	the quran has the answere of ur qst  very clearly    i. Read this verse:  "They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage."  [Holy Quran 2:189]      HISTORY:-    . When the Turks conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, they adopted the citys existing flag and symbol. Legend holds that the founder of the Ottoman Empire, Othman, had a dream in which the crescent moon stretched from one end of the earth to the other. Taking this as a good omen, he chose to keep the crescent and make it the symbol of his dynasty        The symbol of Islam IS NOT the crescent moon and the star, but it was used by the last Islamic Dynasty, the Ottomans. The Ottoman Empire deemed it appropriate to use the star and crescent as their symbols, but not the symbols of Islam. I repeat, the star and the crescent moon are not a part of the religion of Islam. Because Islam is so strict on the concept of no other gods with Allah; and no images of any kind; it is a mistake to consider that Islam authorized the general use of such things. Additionally, Islam forbids the images (statues) of any kinds of humans, animals or any of Allahs creations, so how about using a symbol for Islam?        Quran proves - "Allah" is NOT a 'moon god':    "And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not bow down (prostrate) to the sun nor to the moon, but only bow down (prostrate) to "Allah" Who created them, if you (really) worship Him."  [Noble Quran 41:37]    Why does Islam follow a lunar calendar?    Answer:  In both the Bible and the Quran religious festivals are regulated by the lunar calendar. Jews and Muslims have kept to these regulations which they believe to be from God. Why does Christianity follow a solar calendar?
rvZtro2uaa	not all hispanics sneak in the country stop generalizing!!! btw i'm not hispanic.|`|PyovKaxhaa	to work in America|`|BTWBLd23aa	Most illegal immigrants, not least Hispanics, are economic refugees.<br>  They were usually redundant or pooly paid in their own countries.<br>  It's not because they like to sneak into another country.

Look close, you'll see it.|`|KO5extXiaa	I don't, praise the lord. :)
AdeD0xMuaa	My first date with my current boyfriend was at a bar with live music. It was nice because it wasn't too loud and if there was a lull in consersation we could talk about the band and enjoy the music.<br>  Any place where you can get to know each other is good. I would avoid the movies unless there's something you both really want to see.<br>  A decent restaurant and some drinks after is always good. <br>  Good luck!|`|DWwv3v9Raa	Be careful and go somewhere that you know is very public, you've never met this person face to face and there are a lot of predators on the internet.  <br>  I would definitely be very cautious on the first meeting, perhaps you can invite some of your friends to meet you out a the place where you decide to go, at least you will have someone there on your side.|`|GSIHc6nQaa	Thats nice. Bring her to the movies, dinner out, ice skating, rollerblading, ask her questions about herself and life. Ask her if she likes where she is living. How is her family. Does she like her job. Once you get into the kind of conversation, a whole bunch of new ideas will pop into your head. Good Luck && Have funn! :)
UepGEiR9aa	aww...don't feel bad, i'm 16 and never been on a date or had a boyfriend, i'm homeschooled, and as you can tell by my Y!A username, i'm an anime geek and i spend a lot of time on the computer, too. Don't be ashamed of the way you are, you can't be that bad...seriously. i'm not that into sports either or cars...i just like the way they look! lolz...|`|4BN9xIaoaa	You have two choices either you can try to change and suceed or fail or you can just stay the same and not live.  I think it's the environment that you grow up in and the things your peers like that determine what you like.Even if you don't have many friends their are still people that like what you like maybe you should reach out and try to find them or maybe you could get people interested in what you like.Certain people will always accept you,I don't know who and I don't know where but even if someone doesn't like your taste in music they can still accept you and show compassion for you because you're a human being.I find girlfriends are very good at accepting someone.  I think the more you know yourself the better off you are.You may just like a sport afterall,it just may be that you haven't given it a chance.Me I like Boxing but haven't made it to the gym yet to really get into it (the boxing gym that is)But never be jealous man,you're a man just like he's a man. whenever I felt someone was better then me or I respected them a lot they went and did something I didn't like and I don't respect them as much.It's hard to see another persons flaws when all you can see is a glimpse of them but the thing about that is everyone has flaws.Some people don't care to show them and some care less and show them.But there was this guy younger then me that I looked up to.He's 21 and I'm 23.He's very intellectual and very witty and I respected him for it but the fact was I was Chatting out side of church one day and he walked off after I said something and that just annoyed me and I didn't respect him as much.Then one day he was coming back with my sister from somewhere(he likes my sister) and I locked the door when she was coming in and she'd unlock it then I'd lock it back and so on then I finally stopped then here comes this dude busting in talking about he would have made me mad.If he would have hit me with that door I would have took his head off.But anyways what I'm saying is It's not right to judge a person when you don't know them and the same goes for people you are jealous of because you can turn out not to like them and refuse them as a person.Me I try to be respectable nowadays and I try to carry myself better then I did in the past.You know but the same guy that mad me a little angry also told me that I'm cool to him,not in those words but he was talking about my mannerisms.So it's good to know yourself through someone else's eyes.  People have to know a lot about cars because that's their means of transportation.If you make 70,000 a year and you live in the country and your car is tooken from you and you don't have any more money to buy or rent a car then you're not going to make money.How would you get to work?People can know about cars and not have to take them to a mechanic and that'll save them money,besides that it's just good knowledge for a man to have but maybe you can't relate to that but I would find a role model that you can relate to and maybe get to see some things that you see in them in yourself and figure out more of your likes and dislikes.  I don't have many friends but I'm very tight with my family and they will always be there.  You've got to set more goals for yourself man especially for your future.Do you know if you're going to college? If so do you know what you're going for? If not then you may want to look up jobs on the internet and see what pays good and what you're interested in at the same time.Me I just started school last year in the fall semester and I'm going to be a fire fighter.I'm 23 now.My life use to be worse when I was in school I went to juvenille twice,jail more than a couple of times and I used to roll with gang members and not come home for weeks.But I've completely changed my life around and without God in my life would that of been possibe?I don't know.  About the female situation I use to have a lot of girlfriends in school but now I haven't had a real girlfriend since about 2004 or 2003 but I'm waiting on someone that I really like even though I'm not hunting for females.I'm looking for a female who is nice and that has a job and money in her pocket,beautiful is a plus and thick ooh wee.But I hope she's smart and funny and knows when to be serious that's what I'm looking for in a woman.  Hey it's been real talking to you man if you ever want to message me feel free to do so,aiight Peace.Oh and I hope I helped,Peace.|`|IH6Wlmqsaa	This is a common way of thinking for most teenagers. Everyone wants to fit in and no one wants to be different. My advice to you is to not be embarrassed about yourself or your music or hobbies! Embrace it and be different, once you start to accept yourself I guarantee other people will too!|`|U9zRe7Oyaa	I'm in high school, and my best advice is to go to a youth group. If your family has a church that they're members in, see if you can get them to go this sunday. they'll announce when the next youth thing is. The people that go are generally more accepting, and there are lots to choose from. I know putting yourself out there seems scary, but if you want things to get better, you just got to do it. And you don't need to worry about girls for now. It's only high school!  And it's fine to not be interested in cars or sports.|`|KKh8rikGaa	By the way you wrote this it is apparent you are doing well in school as far as your education goes, don't worry, girlfriends will come and go and you will develop interest in other things, reading these questions, it seems like you teens want to grow up to soon, maybe I did also, to long ago to remember, or was it just yesterday. Enjoy being 17, 18 , etc, everything else will happen in its own time, ever tried golf ?????
HwujORd2aa	Rent or go to a movie with your friends who don't have plans that night.  Or watch one by yourself.  One of those really silly girly movies or a comedy.  Don't let it bug you too much.  It just means you're waiting for the right person to spend it with and haven't met him yet!  As for the boy you like-maybe you should just try to talk to him more.  But don't make it about Valentines Day.|`|zU6Lf67Eaa	believe me i share ur pain, i don't have a boyfriend for valentines day either..just write him an anonymous letter expressing your feelings along with some chocolates or some other food u can make (that he likes of course) and leave it on his desk or ask one of your friends to give it to him.  Make sure u give him ur   in the letter and ask to call u if he feels the same :)|`|vUpjOUQQaa	Do not worry about it, you are obviously young and have plenty of time.    Most of those roses etc are juct hollow trinkets from schools boys hoping to get lucky and have no real meaning behind them.|`|EcVVcgZNaa	just have fun, don't worry about not having a boyfriend or having a date.  If you like him give him hints that says that you like him, but don't be clingy. talk to him, ask him about the weather,movie, etc...|`|XgMqcXsPaa	lay low on v day then, and distract yourself at home    take your time to worry about next year's v day, let this one pass    you'll be just fine|`|dwBxJSCKaa	Oh girl, I have the same problem. I think you should either get him and other friends something small(like candy) for Valenitne's Day, but when you give him something smile a lot. I have a crush and I think he likes me too, and I'm lucky, his birthday is on Feb. 3rd lol.
oFV48JbGaa	You're freakin captain obvious. How do you not know?|`|xHy7ZjI8aa	direct yourself right now to the To Write Love On Her Arms website. they have a suicide hotline that you should get your friend to call. they're trained for this kind of thing. they are really helpful and kind and loving and they will help your friend make the decision to get some help.|`|F9JdzpfYaa	Tell them to seek help for their depression and that they should seek comfort from a close friend or relative.|`|DHAjsjDsaa	okay first of all dont say anything that will drive them over the edge... tell them how important and precious life is... but mostly speak from you heart... and tell them why its not a good idea.... hope that helps|`|CzaEFJQdaa	Tell them that you are there to listen to anything they have to say,.    this person though should get  help.      One thing i told a friend who also did this was that there are many people that would miss them if they were to leave the world so selfishly. Just mkaking someone feel important can change the way they feel about things.   This person probably has ALOT of held in emotions.    Just listen to whatever they have to say.  Let them know you're there if they want someone to listen|`|FPmSgMsNaa	since its myspace im gonna go ahead and assume this person is lying to you    however, this is what i would say if i knew it to be true    you dont want to end your life, you just dont like your current lifestyle  i beg you to find someone to talk to about your issues, suicide and cutting yourself wont solve your problems|`|GxBeXwy0aa	if this person is a minor and living with their folks, you should tell them asap. it could mean the difference between life and death. if they are older, then you should talk to a professional if you have the time, if not go over to where this girl is living and spend some time with her, even though you recently met. show her someone cares and does not want anything bad to happen to them. and i really hope that this isnt a joke. that would not be cool.|`|GT0hOEGhaa	Ignore is the basic choice.   Reporting the person is the second choice.    If you have a kind heart I advice to ignore the subject and just be friends with the person. But you will probably find yourself being suck into something you didn't want to. I have been there and there is no simple solution to anything.|`|02bkYq9Yaa	I don't know if you are a Christian but if you are, you should pray for her and ask God to speak through you and give you wisdom in this matter. If you know this person well enough, contact parents or a counselor for help. They know better. Remind her of the good things in life. Share Jesus with her. Assure her of your friendship. Thank her for the trust she put in you. You met her over the internet so make sure she's not just making this up. Give her the suicide hotline number. Make her promise to try to contact you before she does anything drastic. Talk her through why she wants to do this and show her why she shouldn't. Ask her what she is solving by killing herself. Hope this helps.
Hi5h9739aa	What is into?  Sports, music, etc.    Example- My hubby doesnt want stuffed animals or candy lol he would want a new Cd or dvd of a concert, a new conert shirt or sports stuff.  That is your best bet.|`|e7YeYfWXaa	what about A watch ?  its something they'll use.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	A Nice elegant leather bound thumb drive.  Seriously, my wife got one for me last year and I thought it was the best gift ever. Mine is 4 gig storage.  I use mine everyday for work because I travel from clinic to clinic So I guess it was something I actually used and that made it a great gift. Anyway if your man uses Thumb drives it may be an idea for you.

90MwwrSeaa	Look at newspaper archives. College records. Local archives at libraries and historical societies might help. You might be able to look up old police reports, but I have never tried that. Some states will allow you to order death certificates, and you can search the Social Security Death Index. You can also ask older professors and other staff members at the college if they remember any incidents (provided it wasn't too long ago). It is possible someone has already researched this and written about it.|`|gtTg0XOOaa	Google the school, dorm hall name. Or do a search in the local newspaper archives.

u4liwDhAaa	Thanksgiving means a time when we come to gather to thank God for all the blessing he has bestowed upon us.  It's a time to be thankful for what we have.    Thanksgiving comes from when the first settlers came to America.  They were greeted by the native Indians.  They had a feast where both sides brought food to celebrate new friends coming together.  It has grown from there.  It takes place in November and is usually the last Thursday of that month.  (It's pretty much a 4 day weekend now.)  Also, Thanksgiving signals the start of the Christmas season.    PS Regarding your Hillbillies question:  The answer I gave you means that they are from the areas I stated.  They are not really from other states just those 2 areas in particular.|`|l1vzoQ1uaa	haha, thanksgiving is when a family gets together and they eat a huuuuuuuuuuuuge feast; normally around november 23 :]
DtotNQ3oaa	I think a group of alike people brings out the best in that people.The freedom from ones own culture is an escape that weakens an individual culturally. In ones own group there are no silly excuses allowed so you feel the burden of a standard as it should be.|`|5vO61nuvaa	Just relax and be yourself, I'm sure everyone will have a great time.

EXurNsB4aa	Well they surely don't live in the Namib desert.  They live where the arable land is, since most Namibians are in the agriculture industry.  Namibia's arable land is in a region called the central plateau.  The capital of Namibia (Windhoek) is also in that region, and a lot of people live there.|`|da4zS4AOaa	the majority of Namibians live on crowded communal lands. However, the Namibian constitution -- widely hailed as a model for other African countries -- entrenches property rights, including the right of all people to own land and bequeath it to their heirs. Therefore, land can only be expropriated by the state "in the public interest" and "subject to the payment of just compensation, in accordance with requirements and procedures to be determined by Act of parliament."

RC5RAzykaa	Genesis 2:7  And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.    "good" in the original Hebrew ??? transliterated "towb" pronounced "tobe"  meaning one or all of the following:  1)  pleasant, agreeable   a) pleasant, agreeable (to the senses)   b) pleasant (to the higher nature)   c)  excellent (of its kind)   d)  rich, valuable in estimation   e)  appropriate, becoming   f) better (comparative)   g) glad, happy, prosperous (of man's sensuous nature)   h) good understanding (of man's intellectual nature)   i)  kind, benign   j)  right (ethical)    "evil" in the Hebrew ?? transliterated ra' pronounced rah  meaning one or all of the following:  1) bad, evil   a) bad, disagreeable, malignant   b) bad, unpleasant, evil (giving pain, unhappiness, misery)   c) evil, displeasing   d) bad (of its kind - land, water, etc)   e) bad (of value)   f) worse than, worst (comparison)   g) sad, unhappy   h) evil (hurtful)   i) bad, unkind (vicious in disposition)   j) bad, evil, wicked (ethically)     1) in general, of persons, of thoughts     2) deeds, actions      But seriously, you know what good and evil is, we all know this.   There was no need for this question.

Have you ever wanted to go out with a girl or kiss a girl. If that is the case (and you are a boy) then you are most likely straight.

Or yes you actually could be a lesbian/or bi.    Im not exactly 100% good with answering questions like this lol so bare with me ^_^    like..if you really want to find out if she likes you back...(that is if u want to) then just ask her if she wants to go to lunch...or breakfast etc etc  then like just start talking bout stuff...  dont ask her immediately lol like...get to know her a bit more or w/e  and then just be like"so i kind of noticed you look at me and smile a lot and we kind of have a connection. So i just want to know like....if you like me or something?"      or idk lol    im bad at these questions i guess -_-    haha      apologies ^-^        just a ? tho..  how old are you two?

If you feel your teacher is getting to close to you, report her.  Period!|`|LaUouVtfaa	Your a lesbian if you prefer girls over guys emotionally and sexually. Anyways, this question didn't really strike me as you asking about your sexuallity. I think it was about what to do about your art teacher. No matter what you're thinking right now, teacher and student relationships are dangerous. You really like her, but the relationship is not even, not even close. This person has so much more expirience than you, and knows more. It's not appropriate if the teacher is hitting on you or showing feeling for you.You should talk to someone about this, I doubt later on in life, you will be like "Me and my art teacher had a fling, it was AWESOME."|`|QLyacOPjaa	a teacher can get fired for having a relationship with a student, for one thing. dont be close minded to the fact that she may simply be looking at you for friendship, or she admires your art. it is ok to be a lesbian, and if it's where your true feelings lie, be happy with yourself. but here's a question to ask: have you had those feelings for anyone other than your teacher? any other women you are attracted to?|`|793OI1W6aa	Are you in high school?

Tell her you need to talk to her in private and say, 'I kind of have a crush on you.' And see what she says.|`|s4k29qKPaa	You can just have a girl-crush on her. i think some girls are pretty but it is not like i want to kiss them or something like that. and if she has an abusive husband then ask her if she is ok. and if she is to afraid to call the cops on her husband, then u do it. but only tell the cops if she wants you to.|`|fbQ2q6FMaa	You are a lesbian but if you like guys too you are a bisexual like me. And I'm sorry, but your teacher probably thinks you're just another good student. I'm sorry.|`|alDqf8DAaa	Oh dear, um even if you did tell her, where would you expect this to go?  It is illegal and how do you know she just relates to you, i have teachers who are nice and smile at me too, doesn't mean there lesbian and like me though.and you said she has a husband?    and what does she look like? cause you can tell someones orientation by whaat they look like sometimes.|`|ad6KtWjXaa	You may be a lesbian, you may not, that is up for you to figure out and not something some group of random people on the internet can figure out for you.     However, whether or not you are is some what irrelevant to the situation you are really asking, whether or not you should peruse something with your teacher, and to that the answer is a resounding no. A relationship, even if you both wanted it or not, would be trouble for both of you, but especially her. I assume you are under age, which would make things even more of an issue. You have a crush, it will pass in time, let it go and move on.

QM2UqZmuaa	What you asked for is not what you used as an example.    The teacher *has* to be able to make sense out of that. Otherwise, it is not comprehensible. Something incomprehensible, could be like "Does God exist?" Or "God wipes the memory of those that went to Hell when you go to Heaven." So let's say a mother gives birth to a son that becomes an atheist. And her son goes to Hell. If the mother goes to Heaven, how can she not be mad at God for her son has gone to Hell? Christians believe, that God will wipe the memory of that, so the mother will no longer remember her son. But how will she feel about this while still at Earth?    As for topics that are complicated, hmm, that's a tough question.

After they had broken through, they let down the mat on which the paralytic was lying. <br>  5 <br>  3 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins are forgiven." <br>  6 <br>  4 Now some of the scribes were sitting there asking themselves, <br>  7 <br>  "Why does this man speak that way? 5 He is blaspheming. Who but God alone can forgive sins?" <br>  8 <br>  Jesus immediately knew in his mind what they were thinking to themselves, so he said, "Why are you thinking such things in your hearts? <br>  9 <br>  Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, pick up your mat and walk'? <br>  10 <br>  6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth"-- <br>  11 <br>  he said to the paralytic, "I say to you, rise, pick up your mat, and go home." <br>  12 <br>  He rose, picked up his mat at once, and went away in the sight of everyone. They were all astounded and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this." <br>  13 <br>  7 Once again he went out along the sea. All the crowd came to him and he taught them. <br>  14 <br>  As he passed by, 8 he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the customs post. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him. <br>  15 <br>  While he was at table in his house, 9 many tax collectors and sinners sat with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him. <br>  16 <br>  10 Some scribes who were Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors and said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?" <br>  17 <br>  Jesus heard this and said to them (that), "Those who are well do not need a physician, 11 but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous but sinners." <br>  18 <br>  12 The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were accustomed to fast. People came to him and objected, "Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" <br>  19 <br>  Jesus answered them, "Can the wedding guests fast 13 while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. <br>  20 <br>  But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day. <br>  21 <br>  No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak. If he does, its fullness pulls away, the new from the old, and the tear gets worse. <br>  22 <br>  Likewise, no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are ruined. Rather, new wine is poured into fresh wineskins." <br>  23 <br>  14 As he was passing through a field of grain on the sabbath, his disciples began to make a path while picking the heads of grain. <br>  24 <br>  At this the Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the sabbath?" <br>  25 <br>  He said to them, "Have you never read what David did 15 when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry? <br>  26 <br>  How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of offering that only the priests could lawfully eat, and shared it with his companions?" <br>  27 <br>  Then he said to them, "The sabbath was made for man, 16 not man for the sabbath. <br>  28 <br>  17 That is why the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath."

In practice, we live in a cruel mad world that is irrational, and as such these chicks are exploiting their parents' status to get cash in the bank and make a living, easy living I'd say. They have a huge competitive advantage over us mortals because their parents have done that before and can benefit from a huge marketing machine behind them, contacts, etc..
Owc1LBRMaa	To say that without Catholicism there would not be Christianity. Christianity started in the first century. Catholicism started several centuries later. I realize that Matthew16:18 is used to support the idea that Peter was the first pope.Yes Peter's name means rock but the reference "upon this rock I will build my church..." is not in reference to Peter. It is in reference to the answer that Peter gave in Matthew 16:16. <br>  verse 15 Then He asked them,"But who do you day that I am?" Jesus is talking to the apostles.<br>  verse  16  Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."<br>  <br>  the Christ,Messiah--is a Hebrew term<br>  Christ --is a Greek term<br>  Both mean "the anointed one"<br>  <br>  So Jesus comment "upon this rock I will build my Church" is referenced  back to Peter's comment in verse 16|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I have only seen that here.

ATPPWOpWaa	We as Christians have never had to observe the Sabbath day. God instituted the Sabbath specifically for the Mosaic Israelites and for a specific reason that applied only to them.    Ex 31    16 The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.  17 It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested.      Deut 5   15 Remember that you(Israelites) were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.    The Sabbath is a part of the Mosaic Covenant and did not exist from Adam to Moses or apply to anyone else in the scriptures at any time.  And the very purpose for the Sabbath was a remeberance for the Jews and the freedom gained by Gods hand.  This is specific to Mosaic Jews and ended with reserection of Jesus Christ and the Covenant of Grace.  One can say that we are to observe the Sabbath day because of the Ten Commandments.  But we as Christians have never lived under the Ten Commandments either.  These commandments were for the Mosaic Jews.  The Bible tells us so.      Heb 8  6 But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant(Grace) with God, based on better promises.  7 If the first covenant(Mosaic) had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it. 8 But when God found fault with the people, he said:    The day is coming, says the Lord,  when I will make a new covenant  with the people of Israel and Judah.  9 This covenant will not be like the one  I made with their ancestors  when I took them by the hand  and led them out of the land of Egypt.  They did not remain faithful to my covenant,  so I turned my back on them, says the Lord.  10 But this is the new covenant I will make  with the people of Israel on that day,[c] says the Lord:   I will put my laws in their minds,  and I will write them on their hearts.  I will be their God,  and they will be my people.      Deuteronomy 5  1 Moses summoned all Israel and said:        Hear, O Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them. 2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.   """" It was not with our fathers that the LORD made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today""""".|`|LuN1unJ3aa	What covenant?    And what day of the week?    If you want to be hung up on the letter of the law, that's fine with me, but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord, who said that the Sabbath was made for man and not the other way around.    It's time to worship the Lord, not a day of the week.|`|AA10471892	Sabbatarians get around the facts here by claiming the sabbath was put in force at creation, ignoring the context there.

e28ef20545f237d650432879a6f3044faa	yes i have experienced them. as weird as it is, I'm a christian, always taught to believe in no such thing... until i experienced it. its unexplainable to some extent tho. In my old house, when ever i went to bed, I could always feel at the bottom by my feet the bed sink down a little like someone just sat down. creepy feeling. well I just recently moved into 1/2 a house and in this house, I have actually witnessed what seems to be a figure of a woman walking across my kitchen. (a 1/2 of a house is a large house that has just been divided into 2) and this hasnt happened just once. my neighbors have seen her also. also, in my friends mom's house, in their dinning room, theres a little boy in the old time gown pajamas that has been seen in there. I have yet to experience one to talk to me or anything but a coworker of mine has said that when she goes to bed some nights, she hears someone say her name clear as day right before she falls asleep as if they were right next to her. also for a really creepy addition, my friend was on the phone with me one day, she was home alone, and out of nowhere, a stuffed animal was thrown out of the bedroom at the bottom of the hall in her house right after she moved in. like I said, I was raised up to not believe in this stuff, but once you experience things like this, its hard not to believe.|`|CUjtMRvDaa	I do not strongly bleven in goghsts I just bleve in sperte like your famly member that diyde and hers or his sperit comes back to life.

I think that would be more mind-blowing than the resurrection.|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, I'd have to go with the Ascension.  Creation is THE big event, of course.  Without that nothing else happens.  But that's sort of a given - we're here.  Next up is the fall of man, from the human point of view.  Without that, there would have been no death and no need of salvation.  Again, though, that's a given:  we all die.  Third is the Resurrection, because that's the point at which we regain the opportunity for eternal life - but the Resurrection itself is not very eventful.  Unless you were there to witness the crucifixion as well, the Resurrection would not seem particularly miraculous.  However, the clincher for the whole Christian salvation thing is the Ascension.  Here we see Jesus rise into the clouds - not an easy thing to fake in those days.  This single event confirms the complete essence of Christian doctrine:  it proves that the good news is valid news.  It is the only individual event that incontrovertibly confirms the Christian doctrine.

oHrqbdydaa	Isn't it in there already? I mean, talking snakes, making people out of dirt, virgin births....what else do you want----dwarfs and fairies?|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	No.  Don't think so.  It ever will.  Just an analogy of Jack running off with the golden eggs.  While Indiana Jines with Raiders of the Lost Ark were still digging up graveyards from the twilight zone to different time zone who ended up empty handed with more cheap-skate ghostly stories from the graveyards in time.  Luke 21.30-33  Luke 9.25,55-56,60  Luke 8.5-8,10-17  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49  Luke 10.24  Luke 19.9-10  Revelation 5.2-5  Matt 22.17-21,32  What do you think?|`|4rWPX8CTaa	I thought it was in the bible, along with Cinderella and Snow White.

I think Karl Marx' "Das Capital" is a load of old toss, but it doesn't bother me if others read it and believe it.    Try not thinking or talking about the bible or God for a year. I think children could manage that long between comments about Jack and the Beanstalk. If you can't do it with the bible, maybe you need to wonder why.

WX1b747Iaa	I agree with your well reasoned view, and I read the whole thing. Let those who lack the attention span of a gnat, and didn't read it, withhold opinions based on immaculate conception. That is, uninformed opinions given without having fully considered an issue, and therefore about as valid as flatulence.|`|AA11058044	I agree with you, but you might want to think about adding a paragraph break or eight in there.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Without reading your entire "novel," I disagree with your hypothesis.<br>  <br>  Science today is aware of the existence of a great many things, both on earth and elsewhere, that people just two hundred years ago had no method to detect. Their inability to see the evidence did not mean the things in question were absent.<br>  <br>  There are undoubtedly things in existence that we do not yet have the ability to detect. Our inability to do so does not suggest that such things do not exist.|`|YLqVv7Lzaa	Absence of evidence can be evidence of absence, but it can never be proof of absence. For example hundreds of years ago European scientists would have dismissed the idea of an egg-laying creature that had a duck's mouth, a furry body and a beaver's tail due to the fact that nobody on the continent had ever seen one and there was no evidence of its existence. Then they discovered the duck-billed Platypus.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I don't think absence of evidence is ever PROOF of absence but yes it can be used to assign plausibility and liklihood values as evidence although not proof. It is never logically reasonable to hold something probable that has no positive evidence.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Well I didn't read your wall of text but I disagree with the idea that absence of evidence IS evidence of absence. <br>  Up until either the 1800s or early 1900s (can't remember exact date), people in the west had no evidence to support the existence of the Giant Panda. Tales of a large, black and white, herbivorous bear living in the mountains of the far east were dismissed as myth. It turned out they were quite wrong and as we all know, there is such a bear.<br>  It's best to keep an open mind.|`|AA11203798	mien kampf IS true, so get out of that issac!!|`|ARUinuP7aa	They are not the same|`|3E6lf2cJaa	The fact that there is absolutely no evidence suggests absence.<br>  <br>  <br>  Simply put, how do you explain the similarities between the Jewish stories and other nations they came into contact with of their time? The greeks were also considered intelligent, yet they had tons of mythology which they believed to be true for a period of time. <br>  <br>  Human beings find ways to explain things they don't understand, sometimes an explanation makes so much sense and seems so right but only until they gain more knowledge that disproves their previous beliefs. Usually people just let go of their old beliefs, but some beliefs just don't die.
TyRfv0eoaa	Da at.  Stress on first syllable. Pronounce both a's as in Father.    Note that a better transliteration is Da'at, as Hebrew does not have a "th" sound.
3BHPJweWaa	The Christian God didn't *exist* (in human consciousness) until Christianity created Him!    Altho derived from the Jewish God, obviously *not* the same God.  The Jewish God doesn't have any "only begotten Son" who is the *only* way to "salvation" & eternal life.    *Not* the same "God" as Islam has -- for it is blasphemy, in Islam, to say that Allah had a Son.    Coming from the Hindu perspective, that of the Ultimate God being Brahman:    "Brahman is the unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe." -- Wikipedia    -- God was content to sit back & watch humankind flourish without "his" [sic] guidance because the Ultimate Divine *was* (& is) all-that-*is* -- the sun, the sky, the trees, Jesus, Plato, every individual & living entity that has ever existed -- but always on this adventure of *Change*.  (It might be very *boring*, otherwise! ;)  ).      It is hardly the Ultimate God Who is making it a sin to worship other gods (for the Ultimate *is* all those other gods & goddesses, too); it is human egos projecting their *own* values upon "God" who are trying to rule over/ control others with their beliefs -- thus creating the judgmental religions with those kinds of illusions of grandiose ego-mania.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	what the **** kind of stuff comes up on here?|`|cNniG2L0aa	"for hundreds of centuries, was your god content to just sit back and watch mankind flourish without his guidance?"  Then five thousand years ago, but only in the "really barbaric, illiterate parts of the middle east", "not in China where people can read or think or do science", no, no, in "really barbaric, illiterate backward parts of the middle east" it's decided "we can't let this go on; we'd better intervene".  ~|`|nooi0ldjaa	"No one is going to to sit here and explain to you..."    just means "damn...you poked a hole in my logic!"  your not going to get a matrue or grown up answer...nice try though :P|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	First off, God was there from the beginning, before the pagan religions developed.    Secondly, as was stated before, God gives us free will and doesn't force people to believe in Him.    Thirdly, He never completely abandoned people of other religions. That's why missionaries have been sent to other countries to preach the Gospel.|`|1cGlucXyaa	God was around that time. Haven't you heard of the story of Noah. Plus the people had turned from God, not the other way around. Just like before Noah. The people during Noah's time had stopped worshiping God. Instead of using the flood a second time, which he gave us the covenant that he wouldn't, He decided to start His chosen people through Abraham. Haven't you read where He tells him that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars.|`|PT49mUyeaa	great question, unfortunately most of these answers are weak. The free will answer is especially weak.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Because Pagans are cool and even God knows that.

He realizes that nature can give warmth, comfort, oxygen, food, water, happy things that he himself has never given.    Why didn't he appear? I dunno. Maybe he was just waiting for a beautiful world to appear before he came along, so then he can take the credit. Some people like to take credit for things they didn't do. Maybe we got it from God?|`|WJ4e4NYzaa	OUR (yours too!) God gives us a few basic rules to TRY to live by and then lets us decide for ourselves how we want to live our lives. A loving God will not FORCE anyone to do anything.    The only thing mankind has "flourished" on without His guidance is division, conquer, oppression, and selfish pride.    God is never going to demand you do anything- you always have a choice. He only asks that you TRY to follow Him the best YOU can, repent for your sins, and try again.     God Bless you.|`|hXxZ2kVfaa	it's because God gave people free will.|`|3gT4kKG4aa	its just a test|`|OC9ol3TLaa	God :) capitalized      free will ^_^|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	God is still content with this and it still goes on today....

Once people figured out they could get a quick buck and a feeling of smug satisfaction by controlling the lives and beliefs of others, God suddenly showed quite an interest in humanity.  And by God, I mean the priests who represent him oh so well.    Incidently, I'm a big Zeus fan myself.|`|YPtHMflGaa	All 'gods' are fiction based on misunderstandings on the nature of the world. Thousands of religions have been created and most of them have disappeared over time. This was particularly true when religions moved from being polytheist to monotheist in nature. When it was created Judaism borrowed much from Zoroastrianism, and in turn Christianity borrowed much from Judaism and Paganism, while (as a much younger religion) Islam in turn borrowed much from both Judaism and Christianity.     As mankind's understanding of the world and human behaviour increased in complexity, so too did the religions that sought to always be at the centre of that understanding.     It's all about marketing and in the end the core drive for any religion is all about seeking power, money and influence over it's devotees. Like anything, religions have had the need to tweak their marketing messages over the years to keep up with the zeitgeist of the day and to keep the faithful in line.     It's ironic but Religion, like everything else, is subject to evolution and those that do not adapt - die.|`|xlSlfApBaa	the idea is that before god 'blessed' humans with his presence they were primitive and therefore people that do it today through new age (i.e. goddess worship) are just as primitive.  It gives christians a reason to call then stupid, create a barrier and think they are above the rest. As for the druids and such, earth magic was around a very long time before christianity. And most religious sects were confined to certain areas (i.e. druids=england/ireland)(judaism/muslim/c... east)  It was only when people started becoming truly international and used global travel that the word spread that if you werent a christian and didnt worship their god then, hey, you may just face eternal damnation.  Sorry, studied the contradictions of the bible for 6 years at high school. You get kind of over it after a while. Interesting info though. majority of kids that go to catholic schools and up not being catholic or following a different religion, usually a more down to earth one, whether it be pagan, wiccan or buddhism

The Oxford English Dictionary contains pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (30 letters).    The longest non-technical word in major dictionaries is flocci-nauci-nihili-pili-fication at 29 letters.

And while you don't really say...are you speaking of getting totally loaded?  Or just having a few cocktails?  In either case, I think the fact that they don't have to be anywhere the next morning plays a major factor.  So....Hmmmm...I think some people just like the way it makes them feel for a while.  Even if only for one night.    FYI - I am not a drinker at all!!  I hate the taste of alcohol.    EDIT:  I thought of one more thing!!  BOREDOM!!

I would LOVE to spend the night with Helena :p|`|yzQAZMkoaa	not sure never really connected with no on in here|`|rDFnsFf2aa	DANA|`|36b213c16926132fde2d00722cbf60d3aa	I would choose Alice because she is hilarious. She's also cute, but she would make me laugh all freakin day!|`|v6tK8lhOaa	I'm gonna go with E.M. on this one.....Bette's sex is on fire..|`|X1j7qYkUaa	Jodi or Joyce, either one for their strong self confidence and yet wounded vulnerability, stirring some mutual ego driven fires and because in less than a day we could have any city in a collar on its knees with no idea of how it got there and still wondering who the hell we are....  or be just as comfortable with sharing casual conversation over a couple drinks and leaving the dyke drama out of it because it's frankly too exhausting to watch those lamearse go-fish hos with their petty bs anymore.  <br>  <br>  Or maybe just to hookup with Max's ex, he's on the market.. and likely damaged just enough to be suitable for a good fling.|`|8Vz9JF7paa	ahhh geeeez.... ummm well I loved dana and carmen! and I think papi is hot n tash is cool... I liked the old alice character.... and bet gives me the sh*ts lol ...I think Helena :) haha she is mega hot lol|`|gqEbkkcdaa	Shane.

BDSC8R3Aaa	I have seen that since 30 years ago. The most beautiful women get involved with jerks, criminals, crooks, etc, and then, when the guy begins with his jerknesses, they say that men are this, that, etc<br>  <br>  Nobody told the woman to get involved with that piece of slime<br>  <br>  It is NOT MEN. It is THE GUY THEY CHOSE which is a jerk, but they  are totally unable to realize that<br>  <br>  They rather blame the rogue than themselves|`|AA12316366	why are you so boring and judgmental? if you resemble your avatar not only are you boring, you ae ugly|`|gspTDufpaa	Most guys are just like that. So deal with women instead.|`|FpMS47sXaa	Well, maybe you are in fact boring to him. Remember, just because you don't like his opinion, that is no indication of him being a jerk. You have had your feelings hurt. It's normal to feel this way.<br>  <br>  Just relax.<br>  <br>  I can tell you from experience, that when one person tells you something negative like this - there are 10 others out there that will tell you something positive.<br>  <br>  Cheer up, little one. This guy isn't work your time, anyway.|`|ROVhLgH7aa	Would u rather he lied to you? Some of us are honest and I should be feeling this way when my lover told me I was boring. I didnt take offense to it because it is what he has noticed. So lady, be glad he told u the truth and u didnt find out from a friend or the other woman, especially when she tell you "My wife is soooo boring in bed, she can only have sex in one position!"|`|yzQAZMkoaa	cuz that's how they were raised... for get about him and find some new that dont think that way some one that understands you.. lolz that points to a chick soo date a chick lolz nah dont date a chick if u dont really feel nothin...|`|upvd5TRRaa	not all guys are jerks.  he's just not the right guy for u hun.  no worries, u will find him one day.|`|MYIwyTpcaa	Maybe because he was comfortable enough with you to tell you (okay kinda rudely) what his true emotions were about something, and you have to go get all huffy and psycho about it.. *lol* <br>  <br>  Or..maybe he's just naturally a jerk.<br>  <br>  Or..maybe you ARE boring.<br>  <br>  Was it about something in particular, or just in general?<br>  <br>  Daisy - come on, like some chicks aren't gigantic jerks themselves! :^)|`|idsUl8vOaa	Man, that guy is an ***, an girl, i know you think it aint my place to say how i feel, but imma say it anyway cause i gotta keept it real. I know ur tired of trying to make it be,something its truely not. An girl, it kills me everyday to see you in tears, an it amazes me the way you put up all these years. You been tweaking tryina make it work, but you keep ending up hurt, baby listen to me...You don't have to wait, i can ease your pain. You dont have to be left out in the rain. Don't jus say you're fed up, tired of love, w/e you need i got it come with me, :) We should talk, cause it don't take a lot to understand, you need yourself another man xox|`|sRsGTgqIaa	Ask him why he said it and be prepared to listen. He may want you to do more with him and that is his way of venting.|`|rM6gBb2baa	Maybe he finds you boring.  If so, I applaud his honesty.  If you want a man who kisses your as$, then apparently he's not the one for you.|`|ukgDQsnKaa	One word answer, "testosterone" LOL|`|SOx6VwYCaa	Ugh..i hate guys!!! They're such jerks >=[ ...|`|36b213c16926132fde2d00722cbf60d3aa	That's lame. You should just forget about him and guys in general. Come to our side...date a chick!|`|vfhbs3qPaa	He probably didn't realise you were so sensitive. Or he was messing about.
s1Sj3u5faa	yes yes yes  OH MY GOSHHHH  this sounds like me lol!  i am 15 (16 next month) and im i think 5' 11  everyone is like do you play basketball? volleyball?  you should model blah blah blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  it is like odd being the tallest sometimes. idk.  i like taylor swift and she is 5' 11 and she seems so comfortable in herself.  and she said once that if your lucky enough to be different dont change to be the same.  being tall is like good and bad for me..idk?|`|UgDOkQKKaa	i wish i could b them... lol|`|f65f6a3828a7dfca1810ccf182dbfd3baa	Welcome to the real world .  Society is judgemental of midgets,tall people,fat people,blind people ,deaf people and intellectually challenged people.Thats how the society is .The only way to deal with your sistuation is to accept yourself the way you are because you might think that you are really tall but there are people out there who marvel at you when they see you.  Use your tallness to your advantage girl.|`|Lnp70Xm0aa	When I see a tall girl, I think "hmm, a tall girl", nothing else. And when you're good looking too, I would think "hmm, a hot tall chick, if there's a chance she would ever date with me...". So, for some guys, height is no issue as long as it is no issue for you...|`|gtTg0XOOaa	I am the smallest of my friends. Everywhere we go, they tower over me. I must admit, it's kinda funny. When we hang out, it's strange but I almost feel... protected? Is that the word I want? Perhaps...  I digress, my best friend is 5'11", my buddy Michele is about 6' and they have found men of the right height. You are who you are, and you can't just take a pill and shrink, so you can either hate or love yourself. What words would you use to comfort a friend who after years of genuinely trying to lose weight, still can't drop down to a size 4? Her body type doesn't allow it, so she can either look into the mirror every night and obsess, or she can start admiring her curves. Do you see what I mean? Look at the positive side.

Was your god unwilling or unable to write a book that would not cause people to murder in his name?|`|8bK578Hqaa	A tree is known by the fruit it bares.  Islam is baring a lot of terrorists.    Hinduism, Buddhism, Wicca, Santeria, Judaism, and Christianity etc are not producing terrorists.    The followers of Islam have attacked, and are continuing to try to attack my country and killing my people.  They are also trying to destroy Israel. The enemy of my friend is my enemy.    When is Islam going to get rid of their terrorists and stop teaching terrorism?|`|6KGGAtNtaa	Thank You, i hope people heed your advice. With all the propoganda and hatred towards Islam in the media, people become brain washed and confused.|`|YCvHJ32Gaa	I posed a question about Sufism in the Islamic area and the only responses I have received so far have all been negative when Sufism may be the most beautiful tradition within Islam.     Also, any talk about Islam must mention that there have been Islamic genocides against the Chrisitans, most notably those propagated by the Ottoman Turks during WWII. How they found time to do this while fighting the war we'll never know but all that matters is they somehow did.

1NtwIeLyaa	God hears every prayer.  And sometimes, He knows what is good for us, better than we do.  So if you're asking for something that He knows would not be beneficial to you, He will not answer that prayer the way you want.  But ALL answers are for our benefit, so thank Him just the same.<br>  <br>  God bless you,<br>  <br>  Harmony|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	Just because you want it to happen, does not mean that God wants it to happen. Fasting and praying is great, but just remember it's God's will that is to be done, not ours.|`|usfVqbajaa	are you getting a clue now?<br>  <br>  here's a hint:<br>  <br>  existence|`|s7pqFa1eaa	My dear, prayer is useless you get the same answers if you don't pray: Yes, No, or Wait. If the answer is yes, then you will believe god loves you and wants you to be happy. If the answer is no, then you will believe that god is unhappy with you and that you need to do more. If the answer is wait, then you will believe that god knows what is best, and will come through in his time.<br>  <br>  If you want or need something, you need to work toward that end, prayer just will not help!|`|AA11220299	Praying is not for the purpose of getting things from God, but to get to know the will of God. Have you considered that maybe it is not God's will for you to have your request?|`|UutLVO2Laa	God doesn't exist.  What makes you think that he does?|`|JsGX1bfRaa	Prayer and fasting is a powerful way to get God's attention, but fast healthy. Don't put your health at risk. Every little sacrifice counts, even if you can only afford to cut back a little on food.<br>  <br>  I prayed for years for God to show me what career I should change to because I desperately needed to find a new career (even though I had a job but it was very unhealthy for me) and I got discouraged many times and even gave up on God a few times but I always came back to Him (I'm christian). One day I was complaining to God about how I felt like I had done so much praying and waiting and being patient and it looked like my situation was only getting worse when I came across a scripture that said:<br>  <br>  "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”<br>  <br>  Joshua 1:8-9<br>  <br>  That scripture spoke to my heart and I did my best to remember it and live by it and lo and behold shortly thereafter MY PRAYER WAS ANSWERED.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	God hears every prayer, but the answer isn't always a yes.  God always has our best interest at heart.  Sometimes it's good that He says no.  Yes, you can fast, but there are no magic formulas for getting God to do what you want.  You might want to take a second look at what you're praying for.|`|9qCbCCN7aa	What are you praying for?  healing or things.  Sometimes the answer is no.  Sometime the answer is not right now.  I've been praying for healing for about 19 years and I did not get healed until 19 years later.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	You must believe that Jesus is God, and you  must believe that the only way to get into heaven is by believing in Jesus alone for salvation, without adding any of your own works  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|DHwTtPSEaa	Uhm david did the samething in psalms... can't remember where... beginer here... but he like just kept asking for the removal of his enemies over an over, an then he like finallygets that its God plane vs his.... but he got i think... or something....|`|RZetcwalaa	Heres a thought, stop praying start acting, even xtians should agree with me that praying alone is not the solution.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	God answers every single prayer. But sometimes, the answer is no.|`|MufqgZzGaa	pray to me. i always listen. trust me.|`|rt0ILq8Daa	Hey, just because you believe in God..doesn't make you a Christian, && just because you pray..doesn't mean He has to answer you. I've prayed for a lot of things that just don't happen, then I realize if God wants something to happen, He'll make it happen, if He doesn't make what I'm praying for happen, then maybe it's not supposed to. Life isn't about what we want, what we want..really doesn't matter. God already has a plan for you, me && everyone else in the world. You have to be patient. If you listen close enough, God will talk to you.|`|1pggu5aSaa	It is all in God's timing. What you are praying for will happen when God thinks it is best for you. Believe me he will work everything out for you. You could fast once a week..or grow in the lord. Witness to people, read your bible at least once a day, Listen to Christian music, and do things that you know that your supposed to. God is loving. Stop being discouraged, and just think about what he did for us..!|`|fH2Zlumjaa	Take some action. It really helps.<br>  <br>  Sitting on my knees all day usually doesn't get me anything.
LQqAzHbVaa	LOL  ew
5Wr9Mlwoaa	What you meant to ask: "Why are people insecure about other's appearances?".    Anyway. I am apparantly too ugly ( no other reason ). When I was younger, it used to be no one would have anything good to say. Now older, it changes to becoming like you are invisible.    Like, at a checkout counter, a pretty woman will talk to someone else attractive for several minutes, to the point of backing up the line.    When I come to the counter, not even a hello, how is your day. Nothing. Take the money. Get your *** of the store.    And you wonder why I am insecure about my appearance????????|`|wJGQtHuhaa	Because its either be a super hot person or get teased. Ppl now a days are sooo immature|`|U60L7qNEaa	they are human. we are human.|`|4fikqmnUaa	Heya,  I'm super insecure about my appearence. I feel like guys are always judging me. It's like, I've gotten this image of being 'really good looking' and I have to live up to it. It's loads of pressure. Society puts a load of pressure on us, I totally agree with you, it's stupid.|`|pfke6Jieaa	well my friend welcome to america. land of the free. unfortunately they are free enough to make good looking ppl into gods and good personalities into pathetic. i have asked that question before too but many deny it. ppl love looks no matter how bad the personality of a person is.     they would rather be with a hot jerk than someone who cares about them. they are willing to suffer just to have the price of a good looking bf/gf. but not me.|`|4wnPK7Uaaa	I know and it sucks.     I am "good looking" (I been told) and I think its so unattractive when people are like "I think i am ugly" even if you are why you telling other people it makes you seem insecure.    Also when I am told I am hot I have to live up to that image.|`|ES1bhCyIaa	It's not a matter of "today", this has been going on for all time as we know it. It actually roots from days when mankind was only a primal species. They used looks to determine a good mate, and that was that. This is attributed to the reasons why men like bigger breasts on women. Bigger breasts would generally mean that for a man, they would be a good mate because they would be able to give more nutrition to their children.|`|GxHP40Caaa	I consider personality more important, although I am not sex-driven, which is what is causing the problem you mention. Hormones just making them want the best looking thing there is for as much sex as possible. They will soon regret it when that person is irritating, annoying, full of habits etc.|`|1899lYjMaa	Appearance is the first thing you see. Your ultimate first impression. It is important. Maybe it shouldn't be, but unfortunately it is.|`|nT0jiArsaa	not that nobody cares about personality. it's just that its the first impression. good appearance means you take care of yourself, viewed yourself highly and is confident. and whou are you to judge if they've got something good to say? n_n     assuming, you like movies. now, if you want to talk about movies, will it be 'nothing good'?    and if someone doesn't take care of personal appearance (note: not ugly. coz you can make yourself look good if you'll just try, and ugly and beautiful's subjective), then why would you associate yourself with them?    now, this is a different scenario when you are already friends. then the personality matters.    and to answer your question: why are people insecure about their appearance? because that's the way they grew up. they we're not, er, showered with love and affection and acceptance by people around them. or maybe they really just have weak personalities that they don't believe in the innate good in them. or may be they just want to fit in.    either way, it is because of our very own personality and environment. n_n
oJ2bwej9aa	Yes, it does. The book of Ephesians in the Bible explains that the battle we fight takes place in the Spiriual realm (For Born Again Christians).|`|cpOtr6Thaa	Most people of faith/religion believe that a spiritual realm exists.  Roughly 33% of the world is Christian, 21% Muslim, 14% Hindu and 6% Buddhist and roughly 10% make up the other religions.  This adds up to about 84% of the world's population.  <br>  <br>  16% of the world's population is "non-religious".|`|GGtWK3R4aa	Yes, spiritual realm exists. The door of the spiritual realm can be seen as a white light when a person is dead. That person will then approach the white light in order to find God.<br>  <br>  And with regards to spirits, I do believe in them too because I feel them sometimes. I can feel my spiritual guide and even communicate with her. See, I even know her gender. =)|`|j5YwuVEIaa	Is there harm in seeking healing or protection by spiritistic means?<br>  <br>  Gal. 5:19-21: “The works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism .?.?. As to these things I am forewarning you, the same way as I did forewarn you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom.” (Resorting to spiritism for help means that a person believes Satan’s lies about death; he is seeking advice from people who endeavor to draw power from Satan and his demons. Such a person thus identifies himself with those who are avowed enemies of Jehovah God. Instead of being truly helped, anyone persisting in such a course suffers lasting harm.)<br>  <br>  Luke 9:24: “Whoever wants to save his soul [or, life] will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake [because he is a follower of Jesus Christ] is the one that will save it.” (If a person deliberately violates the clearly stated commands of God’s Word in an endeavor to safeguard or preserve his present life, he will lose out on the prospect of eternal life. How foolish!)<br>  <br>  2?Cor. 11:14,?15: “Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness.” (So we should not be misled when some of the things done by spiritistic means seem to be temporarily of benefit.)<br>  <br>  See also pages 156-160, under “Healing.”<br>  <br>  Is it wise to resort to spiritistic means to learn what the future holds or to assure oneself of success in some undertaking?<br>  <br>  Isa. 8:19: “In case they should say to you people: ‘Apply to the spiritistic mediums or to those having a spirit of prediction who are chirping and making utterances in low tones,’ is it not to its God that any people should apply?”<br>  <br>  Lev. 19:31: “Do not turn yourselves to the spirit mediums, and do not consult professional foretellers of events, so as to become unclean by them. I am Jehovah your God.”<br>  <br>  2?Ki. 21:6: “[King Manasseh] practiced magic and looked for omens and made spirit mediums and professional foretellers of events. He did on a large scale what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, to offend him.” (Such spiritistic practices actually involved turning to Satan and his demons for help. No wonder it was “bad in Jehovah’s eyes,” and he brought severe punishment upon Manasseh for it. But when he repented and gave up these bad practices, he was blessed by Jehovah.)|`|QuaVnaOEaa	Yes......just as I believe a magnetic field exists even though its impossible to see.

There is too much we can't explain any other way.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	I would if there was any evidence to suggest there was. I suspect is it merely the product of wishful thinking.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I've seen no evidence of such that is credible to me. I think there are phenomenon that we can't explain or don't understand yet. Like other things in the past that we didn't understand yet and attributed to the supernatural I think they will turn out to have a natural explanation. I think people who leap to supernatural explanations and spirits due so out of conditioning and perception bias.|`|wwdllMzYaa	i dont think its a realm, is just part of existence<br>  we hve material and spiritual, to me, on teh same realm<br>  we just dont often realise it<br>  <br>  but yeah, i believe theres a spiritual side to life|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	I don't know that I'd phrase it that way, but I believe there are more layers to this reality than our senses can perceive, and certainly residual energies might linger in those nooks and crannies.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	yep the kamis have to live somewhere|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	I believe several spiritual realms exist.  :)  Even Astrophysicists are now studying the possibilities of Mulit-Universes as well as parallel realms, and mulitiple "us."  :)<br>  <br>  Elvis Presley could be alive in another realm somewhere, doing something completely different other than singing.

And I bet some bands would  love to tackle the job, especially if it might be a hit.

That works every time.<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|PgQui4jNaa	Just flat out tell him to leave you alone because you don't like him.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Tell him something like, "Looks like my disease is contagious because now I want you to shut the #$% up. Does anyone have some duct tape for this loser?!"|`|pGZjGFM5aa	HI SCOTT! I AM SITTING NEXT TO YOU RIGHT NOW!!!!|`|LV3Lf6byaa	stop talking to him.|`|ghsc7kolaa	tell him stop or I'll shoot
GPznIhzMaa	I don't think this is a Japanese norm. It might just be her personality. I know a bunch of people who sound just like her and none of them are Japanese. The best way to cut ties with someone is just to keep ignoring them, even if they're persistent about contacting you. I know it can be hard, especially when the other person's really nice.|`|pfke6Jieaa	to be honest with u i think japanese ppl are more tied to relationships with ppl, but thats weird i never experienced ur situation too often. i remember one of my friends he emailed me once and i forgot to email him back then he emailed me again and i was oh yeah huh i forgot to reply to his email. so i just apologized and was not bothered at all that he did that.<br>  <br>  no offense but foreigners tend to be more caring about their friendships with their friends than americans. i notice that because sometimes i text someone and even when i ask a question i dont get a reply, im talking about a legitimate question not some bogus or jokes. and its much harder to become closer to americans than it was for me to japanese ppl. i found them to be very open with their thoughts and very comfortable, but just the first time kinda freaked them out a bit cuz i dont look japanese so they tend to study you more.<br>  <br>  seriously just email her back and tell her im sorry im busy lately she will understand. it doesnt take that long to write an email. u dont have to make it long just say hope we can get together again not just im busy bye. be polite about it and im sure she will understand. unless someone really keeps abusing it then just talk to them but if its someone u dont know then just simply block them. just be patient its not that bad.

Maybe something (*) is bothering you and affects your sleep quality. Try to figure out if something has changed in your life that you don't really like or maybe if you are afraid that something will change soon. Chances are that that's what makes you feel different.   Don't forget that after a down, there will always be an up again. Keep the faith and stay positive!    (*) fear of losing a job, fear to fail at exams, the thought that maybe your boyfriend is cheating, a change in the family situation, a move, fear of the unknown...|`|N0VlabPBaa	Sadness or hopelessness   Irritability, anger, or hostility   Tearfulness or frequent crying   Withdrawal from friends and family   Loss of interest in activities   Changes in eating and sleeping habits    Restlessness and agitation   Feelings of worthlessness and guilt   Lack of enthusiasm and motivation   Fatigue or lack of energy   Difficulty concentrating   Thoughts of death or suicide     Talk to your parents/friends .See someone if you need it, its important!Dont wait too long..how old are you?
afc9f5ad50944a45a9166b94417e9ebaaa	My school had carnations or candy grams...people could buy either for $2 and they would be delivered on Valentine's Day...it worked.  It always raised a lot of money!  Plus, people could do it anonymously, so that made people want to do it! :p|`|K8tyHC5Zaa	yeah my school sells carnations for them to give to their parents or their "sweethearts" i guess. and we also do something called a cookie gram which is a big sugar cookie (not enormous but not the size of an average cookie) that they buy to send to someone else in the school as a v-day present. sometimes they have icing on them that says something nice or has a smiley face or something sweet like that.

You can find them at practically any store. They're not really "sporty" but they're stylish and comfortable.    Try Khol's for gouchos, or maybe Wal-Mart.    Good luck in your search!|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Isn't it a bit cold for skirts and culottes over there right now?
