I have not and never will be ashamed of serving Vietnam or of serving my country and while we were defeated it was not by military means but through inaction by politicians who were/are spineless cowards with no sense of honor.

I genuinely would like to see two things done with this, because there have been moves made that people thought would help this and didn't.  I think we need to repeal the Brady Bill, it puts undue stress on people who would otherwise be allowed to buy firearms and is outdated as we can now do instant background checks, and when you get to it, it's unconstitutional.  I think this has everything to do with the surge in mental illness and I think it would be a good thing if we were able to take a more aggressive approach toward it.  One being institutionalization of people with a history of mental illness, the other would be to remove SSRI and SSNI antidepressants from the controlled substances act.

By moving out of your house or away from the parent who receives the child support, neither the parent nor yourself have a right to the child support money because it is no longer needed as compensation for the financial burden of raising a child.

Once that was done, the sky was the limit, and the numbers became dizzying.<br>  The new administration is already expected to inherit a $1.2 trillion deficit from Bush. <br>  Wall Street bailouts: $6 trillion<br>  When the real-estate bubble burst, Wall Street collapsed, too. Starting with Bear Stearns in March, investment banks fell like dominoes, done in by overexposure to mortgage-backed securities. We're still sifting through the damage. But we know U.S. taxpayers are among the biggest losers.<br>  In hopes of stanching the bleeding, the federal government has spent or put at risk approximately $6 trillion. True, a big part of that number reflects the government's purchase of securities that may actually yield a profit one day. Critics of this enormous commitment will point out that it has yet to produce any solid evidence of a turnaround in the economy's slide, while the Bush administration's apologists argue that, without such a commitment, the news would have been much worse.<br>  The best-known aspect of this epic spending spree is the U.S. Treasury's $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, whose remit has included purchasing so-called toxic securities, giving banks cash and helping Detroit automakers avoid bankruptcy.<br>  But TARP, as the program is known, is just the tip of the iceberg.<br>  The Treasury also gave $300 billion in guarantees for struggling Citigroup, poured $200 billion into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when officials seized the mortgage giants to prevent their bankruptcy, and granted an additional $50 billion in temporary guarantees to keep investors from pulling out of money market funds. Again, a guarantee doesn't necessarily mean the Treasury will actually spend the money. But that money is at risk, and that's taxpayer money.<br>  The Federal Reserve has also been busy. Central bankers have said they could purchase as much as $1.3 trillion of commercial paper from nonfinancial companies to make sure businesses have the working capital they need in an environment where banks are hesitant to lend. The Fed has committed an additional $1 trillion to a variety of credit facilities designed to encourage banks to loosen up, from outright loans to banks, to purchases of securities backed by consumer credit, to $600 billion to buy securities backed by prime mortgages -- a move that knocked standard home loan rates down to 5%. <br>  And there's more.<br>  Among other federal rescue measures we have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s decision to guarantee as much as $1.4 trillion in interbank loans, $300 billion for the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages in danger of foreclosure and a $150 billion aid package for insurance giant American International Group.<br>  A lot of the guarantees that have been made will never come into play; just making a guarantee usually does the trick, if it's the Federal Reserve speaking. Here is some more good news: Some of the government's crisis-related investments may actually prove profitable. Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, believes the government could see a profit of $500 billion from stock dividends and the appreciation of stocks. Just remember, that's peanuts in this game.<br>  There are other variables that complicate the picture on a similar scale. The federal government is on the hook for $5 trillion of debt that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwrote. The two companies themselves hold only a third of that debt, Kogan said, so it's unclear what the taxpayer's ultimate liability will be there. <br>  Also unclear is how the Wall Street bailout money is being spent. The Treasury has been reluctant to monitor how banks are using TARP funds, and the Fed has refused to name the recipients of its loans, arguing that naming names would undermine the health of the companies in question.<br>  "It's a lot of money going out the door, with basically no public knowledge of it whatsoever," said Dean Baker, a co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.<br>  About $600 billion of the Fed's $1.3 trillion plan to buy commercial paper has been spent, Baker said. But the Fed won't say who has received that cash. <br>  "People are making and losing fortunes depending on whether the Fed will buy their commercial paper," Baker said. "We should know what they're doing."<br>  Iraq and Afghanistan: $3 trillion<br>  The searches for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq have morphed into occupations. So far, the U.S. has spent around $860 billion on both, according to the Congressional Budget Office.<br>  But Harvard University professor Linda Bilmes and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University say the agency is underestimating the tab. In their book, "The Three Trillion Dollar War" they claim Iraq will be far costlier.<br>  Modern technology and medicine have kept U.S. deaths in these conflicts low, compared with previous wars, but tens of thousands of wounded soldiers will require taxpayer-supplied health care for years, said Bilmes, who served as an assistant secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration. Factoring in those benefits, replacement of worn-out hardware and other hidden bills, Bilmes and Stiglitz believe the real price for Iraq is $3 trillion.<br>  That money hasn't been reinvested in the U.S. economy as mush as possibly expected, partly because of outsourcing by U.S. companies, Bilmes said. One example is construction company KBR, which used shell companies in the Cayman Islands to avoid payroll taxes.<br>  "A dollar that is spent on a road is a dollar which has a multiplier," Bilmes said. "You have better roads. Whereas a dollar spent on a Malaysian contractor to do laundry doesn't help the U.S."<br>  Tax cuts and deficit spending: $2 trillion<br>  In 2001 and 2003, Bush signed legislation that cut taxes, much to the benefit of the affluent. The first cut was designed to help the economy after the Internet bubble collapsed. The second was to boost growth after the 2001 recession ended.<br>  Kogan estimated the tax cuts have cost the Treasury $1.7 trillion in revenue to date. Of course, that may not be one bit disturbing to the taxpayers who've watched their tax bills go down. The only problem is, the cuts have been critical in opening up the gargantuan budget gap that Obama will face.<br>  Because Bush did not reduce spending, Washington has paid about $265 billion in interest on loans to cover the lost revenue. So the $1.7 trillion in tax cuts really cost around $2 trillion.<br>  Meanwhile, Bush increased deficit spending, incurring more debt service. Bush's expansion of Medicare drug benefits for the elderly, for example, cost around $130 billion, of which $10 billion was debt service between 2006 and 2008, said Kogan, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. <br>  "If some of this spending had been paid for by tax increases, then there wouldn't have been interest costs," he said. "But none of it was. We had tax cuts and spending increases."<br>  In an e-mail, Treasury Department spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin said Bush's tax cuts had helped the economy by allowing people to keep more of their wages and other earnings, increasing incentives to work, save and invest.<br>  McLaughlin also cited an Office of Management and Budget/Haver Analytics study that compared federal spending as a share of gross domestic product under Bush and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Under Bush, spending grew from 18.4% of GDP in fiscal 2000 to 20.7% in fiscal 2008, the study said. FDR increased spending from 6.3% in fiscal 1932 to 43.6% in fiscal 1944.<br>  Of course, Roosevelt was dealing with a full-blown depression and war against Germany and Japan."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/StockInvestingTrading/cost-of-the-bush-era-11-point-5-trillion.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Inv...</a>|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Not that much has actually been SPENT yet, but the spending he's already authorized/demanded is more than all of the combined outlays throughout U.S. history up to and through the Bush administration.<br>  Hurray!!

HLHHM4Mtaa	I think most liberals think State's Rights, especially regarding secession, were decided with the Civil War.  I would love nothing better than to see my state as an independent nation as it once was and have emailed by State Rep. and State Senator expressing that desire.  The interpretation of interstate commerce is the enemy of State's Rights and is far more frequently implemented by democrats than by others.  A stalwart of those rights has long been Posse Comitatus which was passed in 1879 to protect states from federal military intervention (a fact ignored by democrats when Bush was bound by that law in sending troops to New Orleans immediately after Katrina).  The right's of States, though, pose a huge problem for liberals with things like gay marriage, gun laws, etc., because it stands between them and what they demand.  ...and I just yesterday watched a little liberal in the making throwing a fit at Walmart over some candy he wanted.  His screams were the kind heard in movies and his tantrum would have been hailed as brilliant by break dancers of another day.

FInaB3HBaa	Look back to the 1920s when alcohol was illegal - lots and lots of people made free, non-taxable fortunes making and selling illegal alcohol.  If the marijuana were legal, all of those criminals would stop making money and the government could tax it and we all could make money.  Given the slim line between politicians and criminals, I surmise that politicians are on the take from the big drug cartels to not legalize it.  Did you notice that George Bush pardoned a whole pile of convicted drug dealers just prior to leaving office?  Yep, it's just too profitable if it's non-taxable.

If the car is essentially 'fit for purpose' they can refuse to take it back. No product is perfect and as long as the fault can be rectified and it has not affected performance of the product in the long term, the law is on the side of the dealer. But you can tell the dealer you are very unhappy with Mercedes and the poor quality control. Let them know that this experience will definitely influence your future purchasing decision. Ask them what they will do on top of this to change your experience.

Never support their business again and discourage anyone from supporting their business. The bottom line is what a business understands.

There's countless ways you could better spend your time.|`|95d2865a9c20c7a7dd35578183bbfd82aa	Many people know were Scotland is, that doesn't even qualify as a threat.

You've got better things to do with your time, go outside and play baseball.  Also, if you're in a different country, don't worry about it.

M6gkxOV5aa	You will receive a cold weather payment of ￡25 when you local weather station records seven days of very low temperatures. The weather station will then trigger the payments for all those entitled to it. You can check on the met office site for your nearest station and you can also check how many times that it has triggered this winter. Pensioners receive a larger amount earlier in the year to help with their fuel bills and this is not dependant on temperature.<br>  <br>  The government have also just increased the christmas bonus for those in receipt of DLA.

w7X1bLZHaa	Liberty is the freedom to pursue a lifestyle that you feel suits yourself without restrictive government infringement.<br>  <br>  As for liberals and bondage... When it comes to liberty liberals only want liberty for those that follow their message. For everyone else (the Majority) they want restriction and limitation to individual liberties. Liberals preach about freedom and equality but they only want it for the elite few.  It is the classic do as I say not as I do. <br>  <br>   Liberals want less freedom, less liberty, and more government control. So I would have to say that liberty is that exact opposite of bondage. Until you look at the elitist Liberals who impose restrictions on us and leave loop holes for themselves. They tie our hands and spank our bottoms and we seem to have no control over it. So that; I guess is a kind of bondage. They are the dominator and we are the passive masses.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	It is often said that there are two types of liberty, positive liberty and negative liberty, or, roughly, 'freedom to...' and 'freedom from...' This, I believe, is a false and meaningless dichotomy. Liberty is a word that does not describe two things; it describes one singular thing, one single state of being. Liberty, like every word in every language, is a word that has developed out of the need for people to communicate. It is an idea that is in essence interpersonal, social. As Mikhail Bakunin, one of the founding fathers of modern anarchism, wrote "Man in isolation can have no liberty. Being free for man means being acknowledged considered and treated as such by another man, and by all the men around him. Liberty is therefore not a feature of isolation, not of exclusion but rather of connection." <br>  <br>  This may at first seem to say nothing new to us about liberty; it doesn't us give a definition of liberty that will be true and valid for all eternity and it doesn't get us any closer to such a definition. However it does remind us of a few things. It reminds us that, contrary to what many people say, liberty is not a matter of being free from people, nor is it a matter of being free to do whatever you wish regardless of the effect that it might have on other people. Liberty is only meaningful when we are free with people. Liberty only makes sense when the freedom of one person does not encroach upon the other but rather re-enforces it. Liberty is not like a cake with only so many slices to go around. It is a human, living thing that only exists in society as we create it; it is a social creation.<br>  <br>  Liberty only exists between equal human beings. Inequality implies the hierarchical positioning of one human over another and, as such, implies the subjugation of one to the other. Inequality creates slavery; it is only in a society of equals that true liberty can breathe.<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, liberty as the liberals think of it, is actually bondage and death to this nation.

A great example of what Rush is trying to put into liberals thick sculls is the same as this headline from today reads !|`|wdz5RMaeaa	What do you mean by ego?<br>  Since you are asking I take it you mean his abilities, his popularity, his wealth, his following. <br>  <br>  As as listener, I know his statements such as El Rushmo, right 99.9% of the time and so on are mostly entertainment schitck. We expect it, it is his personna, and lends to the belief that libs don't see humor in tiny or even obvious places. <br>  <br>  I would agree with you id he acted this way in his personal private life.<br>  He does not. He is generous. He is self conscious.<br>  Have not seen him on EMZ ...... ever.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Thanks to the work of Rhambo in the White House.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Rush is just plain too big period.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Rush can never get that big.  He's so loving life right now.<br>  <br>  As James Carville said about this whole thing--it's great for Rush and great for us.  It's only bad for congressional republicans.<br>  <br>  In fact, I think Rush and James Carville are at least somewhat friendly.  It wouldn't surprise me if they cooked this up together.  Rush gets a ratings bonanza and Carville effectively neuters republican opposition.<br>  <br>  The republicans have to get a similar deal going with Al Sharpton or somebody on the loony left--somebody that can be attacked and likes the sound of his own voice enough to keep feeding the fire.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	First, they had to widen the doors to his studio to let his fat azz in.<br>  <br>  Now they had to widen them some more to let his big ol' head in.<br>  <br>  Pill popping Lush Rimjaughb is a joke.<br>  <br>  A bad one.|`|EenbVs8Oaa	His ego, propensity for self promotion and a seemingly complete lack of any form of humility is why this conservative will not listen to him.|`|vJzvJysSaa	I think pimply faced teenagers working at fast food joints and drug dealers should be thanking Rush for his patronage. Without him, most would not have a job.|`|wnWIxb9maa	We can see very easy, let elephant ear freak debate him.  Rush has called out monkeyman, time for Obama to put up or shut up.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	Yes, and too big for his pants as well.

b21fa9f80551f1440779f4c03a279e4aaa	Thankfully NO.  Rush is an extreme right winger.  I have found once you go extreme left or righ, you viewpoints are much to narrow to be of any use.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	No|`|dHjya1Yoaa	He is the voice of PART of the GOP... not the whole party... If that were the case than he would have been in the limelight for the past eight years... instead of being like a comet that comes back every Democrat President that's in office.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	No, he isn't.<br>  Is...oh, say...Sean Penn and/or Ashley Judd the new voices of the Democratic party?<br>  There is (or should be) a big, big difference between personalities and politicians.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Rush is the voice of Rush.|`|ooCvJWPHaa	yes.|`|f9f4407b08469472a7b821eb01936d16aa	Let's see....<br>  <br>  - He's a hypocrite. (Uses illegal drugs even though he's said a thousand times "All drugs users should turn themselves into prison.")<br>  <br>  - He's been divorced three times. (Something about family values I guess makes these guys want more than one.)<br>  <br>  - His sexuality is questionable. (Funny how he keeps vacationing on small tropical islands with young men, huh.)<br>  <br>  - He's a traitor. (What else would you call it when you openly call for your country to fail.)<br>  <br>  - He's a liar. (Apparently Bush wasn't a Republican or president for the last eight years because they aren't to blame for anything.)<br>  <br>  - He thinks he's always right without bothering to check facts. (Remind you of any dumb presidents we've been forced to suffer through?)<br>  <br>  - He has complete and total amnesia about his mistakes. (See above and note the last eight years.)<br>  <br>  - He refuses to take responsibility for anything. (Note the dozen lawyers he hired to keep him out of prison for his drug use.)<br>  <br>  Yeah, I'd say he qualifies as the voice of the GOP.|`|cBNjgxW9aa	He was described as the de facto leader of the Republican Party by no less than the RNC, Michael Steele.  Later a GOP Senator said NOBODY in the country, either Republican or Democrat, wanted Obama to fail as that could be the downfall of the whole country.  Rush has 20 million listeners though, and many people have great faith in his pronouncements and reflect his opinions in their own.<br>  <br>  I think that unless and until clear leadership arrives in the Republican Party, Rush will continue to have a lot of influence in how the right views politics in this country, and I for one think his views are very unsavory and contribute to the political division in the U.S., which is the biggest threat to our future success as a nation.  So I am very hopeful that new leadership will arise which is truly faithful to the traditions of the conservative political philosophy and returns honor to the Republican Party.  We need more balance in our leadership and less of the see-sawing back and forth between dominance of one party over the other.  That's what doesn't work-we need to focus on the real issues and finding common ground-policies that will work for the greatest good and less for special interests and small constituencies.|`|AA10138269	If hate,racism,greed and self righteousness is what the GOP stands for then Yes, he's there voice.|`|INJSpV4haa	If he is, then it is the saddest thing to happen to the Republican Party since Nixon.<br>  <br>  Sad. Very sad.|`|ERVib5gYaa	Is Rev Wright the voice of Dems?<br>  What is with these stupid Rush questions? The guy is a radio host!!!|`|H6COtFH4aa	GOP is an acronym for grand old party in usa.<br>  yes...|`|xRbL1xJ7aa	No. He's the voice of Satan.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	He would fit right in.|`|DnzL2zWQaa	Rush should be.  He understands that Obama's life dream of achieving economic justice won't work and will weaken the economy.  Rush understands that if you penalize small business owners, there will be fewer jobs, ect.  It all trickles down.  <br>  <br>  Rush at least is brave enough to provide facts about where Obama is wrong.  Wake up & listen America!<br>  <br>  Ugh.   Bianca T's stupidity never ceases to amaze me...|`|0W2kHCDhaa	I dont know....but let him keep talking...lmao...he's sinking the gop everyday !|`|D9AUzmZRaa	Just the part that's dying.|`|kTOPVGeEaa	Must be.

Several People.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	The rank of Field Marshal is the highest rank in the British Army.|`|Qw98dfCkaa	The highest ranking officer in the Army is as others have said General Sir Richard Dannatt who is the Chief of General Staff. His superior officer is head of all the armed forces - the Chief of Defence Staff - Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup.<br>  <br>  Also others are correct in saying that Field Marshall is the highest rank possible in the Army but they are not now appointed in peacetime. Hence the highest ranked officer is currently a general.|`|jqLWuLkDaa	Field Marshal is the highest military rank of the United Kingdom, equivalent to a General of the Army in other countries such as the United States. It ranks immediately above the rank of General and is the Army equivalent to an Admiral of the Fleet and Marshal of the Royal Air Force.<br>  <br>  The rank insignia of a Field Marshal in the British Army comprises two crossed batons on a wreath, with a crown above. In some other countries, historically under the sphere of British influence, an adapted version of the insignia is used for Field Marshals, often with the crown being replaced with an alternative cultural or national emblem.<br>  <br>  The office of Marshal was known in England from the 12th century, but in the introduction of the modern military title Great Britain was a relative latecomer. It was introduced by George I, the first King of the House of Hanover, in the style of the continental armies. The 1st Earl of Orkney became the first Field Marshal in 1736.<br>  <br>  During the early part of the 20th century, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff was usually a Field Marshal. After the creation of the office of Chief of the Defence Staff, Army occupants of the office were Field Marshals until the 1990s.<br>  <br>  Current practice is that no Field Marshals are to be routinely appointed in peacetime, the last being Field Marshal The Rt Hon. Lord Inge KG GCB PC DL, although Members of the Royal Family and certain other very senior officers are still eligible to be appointed (none has, however, been appointed since the general suspension of promotions to the rank). The rank of Field Marshal is the only rank in the British Army where the individual never officially retires, as the rank is conferred for life.<br>  <br>  Although traditionally, the British monarch is a Field Marshal, HM The Queen does not take enjoyment of this honorary rank. TRHs The Duke of Edinburgh and The Duke of Kent are two of the few remaining Field Marshals in the British Army.<br>  <br>  The Royal Marines do not have an equivalent rank to Field Marshal, although the position of Captain General Royal Marines has the same insignia as an Army Field Marshal.|`|soz1f8uOaa	The queen is the supreme commander of the armed forces, and also it is UK law she can take command of the army in an emergency time.<br>  Other than that the highest rank is Field Marshall, and this is several people, it is not just one man, to avoid a military coup.<br>  Hope that helped.|`|OHfcGAgIaa	GIG - what are you on about?

The working class people felt that they were being overtaxed to pay for other people to not work. The working class also saw a distubing lowering of moral standards as single moms were being subsidized. This subsidy caused an explosion of fatherless children.<br> <br> Reagan appealed to people who thought working for a living was a requirement for every citizen. <br> <br> The Iranian hostage crisis helped immensely of course. People flocked behind Reagan when he said the terorists had better hope he doesn't get elected because he'll bomb them. The hostages were freed following the election but before the innauguration.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	Tax cuts were across the board. But tax cuts at the high end left more money in the economy for investment in the private sector which leads to job growth and business expansion.<br>  <br>  And for what it's worth his tax policies lead to the boom in all sectors in 1990s.

Spending that vastly expanded under Reagan along with the deficit and debt.

yQ0OzEbZaa	You are so right. Obama owns this mess, and he will be voted out in 2012, but, this is a liberals wet dream  for Pelosi, Obama, Reid, and company.  Remember that Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, gave us half of the administration's strategy soon after the election in a talk with Wall Street Journal staffers: "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before."<br>  <br>  So, have a crisis and use it to get things you want that you couldn't have gotten from people who weren't frightened. Repeat as necessary.<br>  <br>  Want to appoint a tax cheat secretary of the treasury? Just tell everyone you're in a big hurry because of the financial crisis.<br>  <br>  Want to hand out, in one fell swoop, more pork and more paybacks to more favored political constituencies than anyone has ever handed out before?

Theoretically the market is a tool to assess investor expectations of the future profitability of publicly traded companies.  The future time frame where markets are theoretically most accurate is 9 mos to a 1 year.  So the market as its trading today encompass investor's best estimate of corporate profitability in the first quarter of 2010.  The economic policies passed by the Democrats last month will not have begun to impact the economy until 2010 at the earliest.  If the market is trading at these levels or lower by next December and January, then we can definitively say Obama's polices didn't work.  You can't logically point to today's stock market and make that claim, however.|`|J3tv9OeVaa	Only a person who benefited from Bush's no child left behind program would be foolish enough not to recognize that we are living in a Republican-created economy.<br>  <br>  We could use a conservative party.

Do they say dependents authorized ? <br>  <br>  There is way more to it then just how long the course is when figuring out if  a dependent can or can't move to a training location with their Soldier. Best bet is to look at his orders and go with what they say. If they say no then you can't go. If they say yes, then you can go with him. Downside to going is that you move just to move again 6 months later. Ive done that and trust me it SUCKS!|`|fslABgDnaa	If your husband's AIT is over six months I believe you can be housed there.

Well, you couldn't pay me to live on any post any where - Army housing is usually ghetto - especially for the lower enlisted personnel.

AA11494150	The burden of proof required for a traffic stop is reasonable suspicion. There is no legal requirement to tell the person what that reason is at the time of the stop, and it does not have to be traffic related. An example would be your car matching the description of one they are looking for. <br>  <br>  You can request a copy of the officer's report through Open Records law. His report will indicate why he stopped the car.<br>  <br>  If the officer fails to articulate a reasonable suspicion, any other tickets issued after the fact would be dismissed under the Exclusionary Rule (also called The Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine).<br>  .|`|UDxL7lPqaa	"No reason" is your interpretation.  The officer likely had a valid reason.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No,<br>  <br>  unfortunately they'll make up an excuse why they pulled you over.

There are times we stop people for "investigatory" reasons.

Police officers can't pull people over for no reason and since your friend got a ticket then he did something illegal.|`|U12Xuyemaa	They can stop you for suspicious behavior. No you do not have grounds to get the other tickets thrown out.|`|aTLiaEGxaa	Yes it is illegal for an officer to perform a traffic stop with no probable cause. In my department it is recommended to inform someone why you stopped them, but not required. Based on what you describe above I suspect the officer had a reason to pull you over you were not aware of. Maybe a computer read back showed no insurance listed, or a suspended owner. License plate light out, didn't signal 100 ft before a turn? There are many infractions you may not be aware of. To be clear if you can prove the officer stopped you for no reason, the tickets would be thrown out, and you could have a big lawsuit against the department. I suggest taking him to court and inquire about the original reason for the stop.|`|bniWlQ9maa	To get the other tickets thrown out, you'd probably have to prove that he had an illegitimate reason for pulling you over - racial profiling, age discrimination, or the like might do.<br>  <br>  If he discovered something on the basis of a search resulting from the stop, it's admissible as evidence (tickets stand) if anyone in the vehicle consented to the search, or if there was probable cause (he had at least something of a pretext for pulling you over & saw or smelled something that meant there was a high probability some infraction was taking place).  If, however, there was no probable cause, and you all protested being searched, calmly but firmly, then you might have a chance of getting the evidence suppressed. For this to work though, you'd have to convince a judge or jury that your group had not been doing anything suspicious, had demanded to know why you were being pulled over and questioned, and had refused to consent to a search.|`|tUZOUmzkaa	No, It is not LEGAL. The officer must state the reason to pull you over and write it on the ticket. If he didn't write the reason he pulled you over on the ticket.... it will be dimissed in court... Fight the ticket and request a copy of the video cam from him patrol car. You have to request an order of evidence to get the tape but a public defender can help you with that.<br>  <br>  Start by reading the ticket and and getting the police report

55NKPb82aa	Any violation you receive goes on your motor vehicle report. It does not matter in which state you are licensed. Nor does it matter in what state you get the ticket. Also, if you move, any tickets you receive with your current state driver's license will follow you to your new state of residence, and the driver's license you receive from that state. Now, each company handles insurance points differently. The auto insurance company uses a point system under which assigns their individual values to each type of traffic convictions and accident claim. Its effect on your insurance premium will depend on the severity of this speeding ticket.|`|eHoKldphaa	I would like to suggest you get as much information as you could before taking action,here <a href="http://www.CarInsuranceTip.info/free-car-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.CarInsuranceTip.info/free-car...</a>  is a good place for that.|`|TMAq2m7Gaa	Depends on the policy. Some people get one mistake under the policy. Other just start adding up the points. Some times if you are ticketed out of state, it is not shared with the one you live in. So you don't get dinged.  When I lived in MA, a speeding ticket was about $600 in insurance surcharges, plus the cost of the ticket itself.|`|GdnQ81bbaa	You should ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!
aTLiaEGxaa	Although I don't know the details here I am inclined to say no. When you say "ex" do you mean ex wife? If so, even though the car is in your name it would be considered mutual property (in many states). If it is just an ex girlfriend...did she live with you? How long? If she did for an extended period of time this common property rule may still apply. If not, and she does not have permission to have the car, report it stolen. Proof is required to charge you with any crime.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	your ex has the car and you have NOT contacted the police first? something  is wrong?|`|AA11535448	So tell them your ex has the car, explain why, give the investigator all the details you have (ex's address, phone number, place of work).

d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	You know, that's a tough one.  On one hand, it's ridiculous the amount of legislation already in place that's unconstitutional and restricts personal choice.<br>  <br>  There are already AMA guidelines that are supposed to prevent such things, but no way to really punish those who violate the guidelines.  Sure, the state can suspend or revoke the medical license, but we all know that won't stop the already unscrupulous.<br>  <br>  It's absolutely ridiculous that such legislation should be necessary, yet, someone must protect the interest of the state (even a financial interest).  Perhaps legislation should be introduced that provides for criminal penalties for those who violate AMA guidelines at all, and then cases should be evaluated very carefully on a case-by-case basis.<br>  <br>  I really can't think of a better solution ...  But I certainly would welcome one.  Or a perfect world where all doctors are good people who always do the right thing, you know?|`|JV75Iz3eaa	I don't think that needs to be legislated.  What needs to happen is when Mommy gives birth to a litter of 8 puppies and heads right down to get the government goodies, government says "No, sorry, we did away with welfare for everybody last week, and certainly for people who get implanted with multiple embryos while jobless.  Head over to that department to make arrangements to give up your puppies to the state.  Have a nice day!"|`|qayCggxMaa	I don't think legislating what medical care can and can't be given like that is a good idea.  You need to leave decisions like that to the doctor and patient.  Of course, insurance companies make decisions like that every day so I'm not sure where that leaves us exactly.
O5DZvc0Xaa	Because the government LOVES YOU... and wants you to be "happy."<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fluoridealert.org/iq.studies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fluoridealert.org/iq.studies....</a><br>  <br>  Either the Daily Elitist doesn't believe his own answer, or he's a life-long dentist suffering from some complex form of guilt-induced denial.<br>  <br>  1. Calcium fluoride was once thought to reduce dental caries, but in fact that is because it was causing fluorosis, which is an entirely separate problem. (Mottled enamel tends to protect from cavities.)<br>  <br>  With over 50 years of fluoridation data to look back on, it is now clear that there is no correlation between municipal fluoridation and dental health.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fluoridealert.org/health/teeth/caries/who-dmft.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fluoridealert.org/health/teet...</a><br>  <br>  In fact, there is a negative correlation. The positive long-term trend in overall dental health that pro-fluoridation disinfo professionals always like to cherrypick... is actually the same across the board (between fluoridated and non-fluoridated countries)... and is more likely the result of improved dental hygiene, not water fluoridation.<br>  <br>  In fact, non-water-fluoridated Finland, Sweden and Holland cut tooth decay rates by 92%, 82% and 72% respectively over the past 20 years. While in the super-fluoride saturated U.S., public health dentists only managed to cut rates by 50% over the same period (since 1984).<br>  <br>  2. Calcium fluoride is not in our toothpaste or our water. They use SODIUM fluoride, a toxic bi-product of various industrial processes. Instead of these industries having to pay for the costs of disposal, they actually turn a profit to sell it to municipalities, who then lovingly add it to our water supply. (This, of course, is just an ulterior motive. A "bonus" if you will).<br>  <br>  3. "Even more so"??? Even a child knows that any supposed benefits of fluoride on teeth (if any) are only gained from TOPICAL APPLICATION, and NEVER INGESTION. The CDC agrees with me on this point: <br>  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml...</a><br>  <br>  4. Any toxin that builds up in your body over time is dangerous in ANY AMOUNT, not just large doses. Remember, the FDA also claims that Melamine is safe in small amounts, when even the Chinese gov't had to admit it was harmful (and they even executed several people over the scandal). This is just one recent example of why, if you actually trust the FDA, or the ADHA for that matter, you are probably drinking too much fluoride.<br>  <br>  5. EVEN IF IT WAS TOTALLY BENEFICIAL and not harmful at all... how do you feel about the government MASS-MEDICATING YOU without your consent? Don't you think that sets a dangerous precedent? If you don't have any problem with that... what's the matter with you?<br>  <br>  All this data is from the CDC... someone else just put it together. Hmmm, what happens when we compare fluoridation levels with mental retardation rates?<br>  <a href="http://johndmacarthur.com/reports/fluoride/charts.html" rel="nofollow">http://johndmacarthur.com/reports/fluori...</a><br>  <br>  Does that answer your question?<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and Hitler used it in the concentration camps. The Nazi scientists claimed it made the prisoners "docile."<br>  Shortly after WWII ended, fluoridation began in the USA. Google "project paperclip" for more info on what happened to those old Nazi scientists...<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just referenced 23 international studies, and the friggin CDC.  YOU CANT REFUTE THAT WITH WIKIPEDIA. (Nice try.)<br>  <br>  And no, asker, I am not "pulling your leg."|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	They tell us that it prevents cavities.  Whether or not it does, I don't know.  But the fact is, our government has no authority to medicate us.  This is NOT one of the specific powers mentioned in Article 1 of the Constitution.<br>  <br>  The reality is, fluoride was considered hazardous waste.  It is produced as a by-product by the aluminum industry.  Many decades ago, they convinced enough of our politicians (money talks) to put it in our drinking water.  So instead of paying to get rid of hazardous waste, the aluminum industry sold it to various municipalities.<br>  <br>  Who knows, maybe someday they will tell us that mercury cures baldness, and put it in our water?|`|0eOzQsezaa	Keep Going though...

Fluoride has no biological benefit, it causes fluorosis and is highly toxic, it also causes brain damage.<br>  <br>  They put warnings on tooth paste because it is poisonous. Russians and Nazis were the first to use fluoride in the water supply of their concentration camps to make inmates docile and lower I.Q.<br>  <br>  Dear Daily Elitist please provide a single peer reviewed University study not sponsored by the ADA which supports your claim. If you cannot than do us all a favor and admit that you are wrong. There is no proof that fluoridated water is effective in fighting tooth decay. Why? First the only benefit found is marginal and debated, if a patient has a fluoride treatment directly administered to the affected area of a tooth. This is very different than including fluoride into a water supply which is most in contact with the population's skin. That is right the water supplied to your house comes in contact with your skin through washing, there is so little water drank directly from the tap in America much less so actually gargled with to provide any benefit to the tooth. The vast majority of ingested water is done so through cooking. Such as boiling pasta, making soup, cake mixes etc. This is a ridiculous way to effect tooth decay my friend.<br>  <br>  Fluoride is a derivative of aluminum production and is highly toxic to the enviroment, it cost approx. $7500 to dispose of a barrel of it properly. Fluoride is also a component of many anti depressants and serotonin uptake inhibitors. Again these are drugs such as Paxil and Prosac used to relax and calm people and have side effects parallel to fluoride poisoning.<br>  <br>  Fluoride does not have any benefits on teeth. There is not a single peer reviewed paper which proves otherwise.|`|pM81f5tnaa	"Dental cavities remain a major public health concern in most industrialized countries, affecting 60–90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults.[7] Water fluoridation prevents cavities in both children[4] and adults,[8] with more-recent studies estimating an 18–40% reduction in childhood cavities.[2] Although it can cause dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of developing teeth, most of this is mild and usually not considered to be of aesthetic or public-health concern.[4] There is no clear evidence of other adverse effects."<br>  <br>  In my experience,  the anti-fluoridation movement is mostly the brunt of jokes.  A good parody was the movie, "Dr. Strangelove."  I had no idea that people were still getting paranoid about something that fights tooth decay.

What you don't realize is why there's so much seemingly useless things in the package.  It's because they will help create jobs and that gives people money and that gets money circulating with a higher velocity again.  That, and the tax cuts on certain circumstances for -250K salary owners as well as the leveled taxes on everyone else making -250K and the increase in taxes for people making 250K+.  Oh, and payroll taxes, universal health care, etc etc...  You're looking at everything in black and white.  Learn some economics and politics, will you?  That being said, I see what you mean.  But you have to understand that there were so many right-wing Conservatives who disagreed with Reagan and Bush because government spending was at its peak after FDR under these two administrations.  Left-wing Liberals were even more outraged by these former two presidents because even though they had massive government spending which is what Liberals believe in, they had extremely low taxes as well as tax cuts for the wealthy.  Talk about deficit spending at the peak of its performance.  And not all the media is bashing his stimulus plan.

jinAwMGNaa	Yes!!  They've been told that since the 1960's but it ain't happened yet.  All the Liberal politicians want is their vote and they lie to the people and play on their ignorance.<br>  <br>  See the article below:<br>  <br>   <br>   By Patrick J. Buchanan<br>  <br>  How would he pull it off? I wondered.  How would Barack explain to his press groupies why he sat silent in a pew for 20 years as the Rev. Jeremiah Wright delivered racist rants against white America for our maligning of Fidel and Gadhafi, and inventing AIDS to infect and kill black people?  How would he justify not walking out as Wright spewed his venom about "the U.S. of K.K.K. America," and howled, "God damn America!"  My hunch was right. Barack would turn the tables.  Yes, Barack agreed, Wright's statements were "controversial," and "divisive," and "racially charged," reflecting a "distorted view of America."  But we must understand the man in full and the black experience out of which the Rev. Wright came: 350 years of slavery and segregation.  Barack then listed black grievances and informed us what white America must do to close the racial divide and heal the country.  The "white community," said Barack, must start "acknowledging that what ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people; that the legacy of discrimination -- and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past -- are real and must be addressed. Not just with words, but with deeds ... ."  And what deeds must we perform to heal ourselves and our country?  The "white community" must invest more money in black schools and communities, enforce civil rights laws, ensure fairness in the criminal justice system and provide this generation of blacks with "ladders of opportunity" that were "unavailable" to Barack's and the Rev. Wright's generations.  What is wrong with Barack's prognosis and Barack's cure?  Only this. It is the same old con, the same old shakedown that black hustlers have been running since the Kerner Commission blamed the riots in Harlem, Watts, Newark, Detroit and a hundred other cities on, as Nixon put it, "everybody but the rioters themselves."  Was "white racism" really responsible for those black men looting auto dealerships and liquor stores, and burning down their own communities, as Otto Kerner said -- that liberal icon until the feds put him away for bribery.  Barack says we need to have a conversation about race in America.  Fair enough. But this time, it has to be a two-way conversation.  White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to.  This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. <br>  And among them are these: First, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known.  Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American.  Second, no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans have. Untold trillions have been spent since the '60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream.  Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks -- with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas -- to advance black applicants over white applicants.  Churches, foundations, civic groups, school and individuals all over America have donated time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.  We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude?  Barack talks about new "ladders of opportunity" for blacks.  Let him go to Altoona and Johnstown, and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for "deserving" white kids.  Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America?  Is it really white America's fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?  Is that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of the black community itself?  As for racism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose black victims 3 percent of the time, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?  Is Barack aware that black-on-white rapes are 100 times more common than the reverse, that black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common in the first|`|6B3ojD2Laa	No. Have you ever thought about criticizing some of your "conservative" fatcats that ripped off so much more money from their corporations and got away with it than the poor kids and handicapped that get govt. assistance?<br>  Or do you always pick on someone weaker than you?|`|zj91sSsuaa	Yes they do.<br>  <br>  You know they can get al those things in prison (except the car), they should try and get there.|`|1CCeJ6pgaa	yes, and they think that everyone else should happily pay for it. its only FAIR.|`|W2dDHraBaa	I would have to say yes since none of them seem to be able to survive on their own LOL|`|76S5Iq0baa	Day ja freakin voo, man.|`|XVxH0FFAaa	yes|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	No and no.

AA10310586	The answer is very simple. <br>  <br>  Ask yourself, what do you know about Stalin? I bet, you know about millions sent to gulag, about no speech right, about invasion of Poland and Molotov-Ribentrop pact. I think you know nothing more and that is why it is so easy for you to say "He was bad". But you are looking from outside and we, russians, are talking about our own history. And simple answers don't suit us because history is very complicated. Before calling it propaganda of Putin just remember that there are still people alive who remember that time. And they pass their stories to their children and grandchildren<br>  <br>  For example, I am 25 and I was born on the end of USSR. But my grandfather, R.I.P., used to tell me about fighting im WW2 and he liked Stalin very much because Stalin was able to organize 5 years of defence of our country, when enemies were in sight of our capital and when 26 million of our people died protecting our Motherland. <br>  <br>  After the revolution of 1918, when Czar was killed and communist came to power, country was in ruins after civil war. Technology was very weak and we were agricultural country. Stalin said in 1933 that gap between USSR and rest of Europe in technology is 50-100 years and if we won't jump this gap in 10 years we will be destroyed. After this he started his reforms that killed several million people, but when time has come we were able to produce more arms than Germany. After that we created nuke in 1949 and hydronuke in 1953. After that we managed to send a man in space. After that we were among two world industrial superpowers fighting for their beliefs of how entire world should live. <br>  <br>  From the other hand, my grandgrandfather from mother side told me no stories, because in 1920's he had been sent to Siberia for being too rich (big house, 20 cows, several horses) for 10 years and his family was thrown into the street (Stalin orders , but his own village neighbours did it in person). After he returned and rebuilt his house he was again arrested for being too rich and executed.<br>  <br>  As you see almost any family in Russia has similar stories. Everyone has lost their family members either in war or in Siberia. On the other hand our country is big, strong and educated. <br>  <br>  So the question for us is not "Was Stalin good or bad". Our question to the history is "Was the price we paid for our today high or not?"|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	I think that these days Russia is more concerned about what people think of its reputation.

For a Westerner - even a Lefty like me - it is disconcerting to travel in a cab where the driver has a portrait of Stalin on the dashboard. That is not an uncommon sight. <br>  <br>  Many Russians feel that under Stalin, while life may not have been easy, things were under control and economic differences were not so great. Perversely, while Stalin was ethnically a Georgian and allegedly a Marxist, many see him as the embodiment of a Greater Russian nationalism.<br>  <br>  Putin and his backers are not averse to making use of such symbols to bolster their own agenda. Hence a book critical of Stalin could be seen as a veiled attack on Putin and his cohorts.|`|fWP8aBpsaa	Putin is a good old-fashioned stalinist.

AA10083573	I don't know about the Democrats, but I've had a taste of it, and it bites. Anyone out there disabled? Anyone out there receiving Medicare? Those are only a taste of what government does in a socialistic society. If you want certain medical treatments on Medicare, you've gotta get approval. By the time that rolls around, you're either dead, or in the final stages of death, and definitely a lot worse than when you started. Tried living on disability? After they take out the 90+ dollars a month for Medicare, you might be able to buy dog food. Anything that the government brings you, it costs someone money. Where does that money come from? Out of thin air? Free health care isn't free my friends. It costs dearly. My sister is moving to Canada, but because her husband has a good job up there & company health care, she'll be fine. But I don't know if that's true for the citizens of Canada. And if things are so wonderful in other countries, why do so many still come here, even in the face of death or deportation? Yes, there are lots of things wrong with our country, but there's a lot that's right. As I read through all the answers of those who think socialism is so wonderful, I couldn't help but wonder how many of these same people cut down our government for screwing up our economy so bad. You all blame Bush. He's not the president that signed NAFTA into law back in the mid 90's sending all our manufacturing jobs overseas. That's when China started growing so fast. Follow the time-line. The thing is, once you sign onto the socialistic bus, there's no turning back. Once you give the government that much power over you, they can pretty much do what they want with everything else. In many socialistic societies, they don't have a choice over where they can go to school, what job they can get, or even how many kids they can have. Do you really want your government to poke their noses into your private life at the expense of free services? Freedom is never cheap or free. Just ask any vet who lost one of his limbs, and still has flashbacks. Just ask any family who's lost a child in Iraq. Many of those kids signed up to serve because their government was going to pay for their college education. What did they get instead? A folded up flag. Every time the government gets involved in something, it costs twice as much. And we all pay for it, in some way or another. Personally, I'm tired of paying for illegals who get free health care, and I have to sit here with bronchitis, 'cause I can't afford the co-pay for Medicare. If we stopped wasting so much money on these things, there'd be a lot more money to take care of those who were born here. Well, there it is. I said it, and I'm not taking it back. There's way too much whining going on nowdays. Stop looking at what your neighbor has and go get a second job, instead of crying to the government that you need a flat screen TV like everyone else has. And don't tell me there isn't work out there. But we're so spoiled by union jobs, we don't want to stoop to wash dishes, or get that second job cleaning motel rooms. We'd have to miss our latest Survivor program! Wah-wah! It used to be that the whole family pulled together when tough times hit. But how many teens would turn their paycheck over to mom to help with the bills? Not many. This country was built on families working hard...together...and not looking to the government to get them through the hard times. Okay, I'll get off my soap box now, before I start singing The Star Spangled Banner. Just had to get it off my chest. Feel so much better now, even though I still have bronchitis. This too shall pass, as does everything else. Just depends on what replaces it whether it's a good thing or not. <*)))><|`|PHpKo5hZaa	Socialism Defined<br>  <br>  Socialism in the practical and existent sense is an economic system - not a political system - and is a life philosophy that prevails within and through a shared network of business and government. This philosophy, as vested by players throughout this environment, places "the benefit of society" as prime missions of organizations (as well as of individuals). For organizations, "earning a profit" also prevails, rather is subordinated to the prime mission.<br>  <br>  Socialism, as any economic system, is like an evolving organism living under a generally adopted (by no means at all forced) and shared primary philosophy.<br>  <br>  Typically, such a culture as this, which today exists in various countries, can be pinpointed since you'll find at least a national health care system. Beyond that, any group of primary banks will generally intermix common appearance and shared services. Open competition exists and plays an important role, nevertheless the most successful players are invariably those that display the more upright public service image.<br>  <br>  Another evident product within such a system is that since organization and individual operate within quite the team motivational spirit, fascist controls are far less required (as compared to capitalism) in order to maintain general peace and happiness. Although, most fascist controls under Capitalism are indeed aimed at government revenue creation, and through the tool of "punitive" fines (often for violations of actual non-crimes, rather errors or lack of understanding of incredibly thick law books) and prison budgetary devices.<br>  <br>  A socialist economy promotes a very, very high level of individual freedom and expression. Anyone who claims otherwise on this point is ill-informed. After all, this is the modern and educated world, and stifling expression makes no sense to the human cause and aspiration.<br>  <br>  Today's and tomorrow's system of socialism can achieve an extremely high level of economic success and sound long-term stability. See Japan, Canada, Sweden, and France for leading examples.<br>  <br>  I think you listed a very good question here. I'm glad for the timeliness and opportunity to share and listen.<br>  <br>  Edit: A funny little tidbit... Living at home in a socialist environment sees far fewer interruptions of sales calls to the private home telephone. I guess it's seen as less than the best manners within respect for privacy. But, these little benefits added all together, I think, offer a great opportunity for day-to-day contentment and relaxation.<br>  <br>  Edit2: If you put a dozen tuna in a tub with a gluttonous shark, it's a bloody mess. But take out the shark... And you got a lot of REALLY BIG TUNA. Cuba, Canada, Sweden, etc. and etc.<br>  <br>  Edit3: Modern socialism does not "spread the wealth around." Modern socialism allows workers to keep and/or benefit from the fruits of the labor of their own hands - rather than donating it to the rich. In modern socialist countries, CEOs earn only about double the tenured worker - which is plenty for any human. And the CEO earnings stay in the country rather than being sent overseas to some tax haven, where the government also loses from the CEO's earnings. (The average worker in Japan saves $1000 per month - as opposed to the CEO taking $1000 per month from EACH worker and placing it in his overseas account.)<br>  <br>  I hate to have to point out that manufacturing in Japan has laid American industry to waste for its inefficiencies and motivational demise.<br>  <br>  Edit4: Tell the Broken Veteran that we are all enslaved - his is not the only trap laid for us, the traps are laid in every corner of the field. I am in one, too. Tell the Broken Veteran that I am doing all I can, sweat of my brow, blood of my wounds, to free him from his ruthless captors.<br>  <br>  Edit5: Tell Mac that Denmark and France wouldn't be in such straits if they weren't robbed of their profits, enslaved of their missions, and kidnapped of their most talented workers by the black hole of rampant capitalism across the pond. And if the people there didn't complain about going to work every day - emulating the Japanese, for example - they ALSO would have $30 trillion in savings and reserves by now (like the Japanese). Whereas they could ALL go to university and ALL do what they want.<br>  <br>  While Denmark and France are indeed examples of socialism, they are the worst examples (but there again, due to having been depleted by the capitalist competitor). Believe me, there are shining examples. See "Tokyo."<br>  <br>  Have a vision. Here is a person telling you where to go in the future by fully reversing his head and looking to the past.|`|Zo9eWZrLaa	They are all like frogs in tepid water, slowly being brought to a boil and unaware of the fact that they are being cooked alive, and without the common sense to jump out of the water.

And even someone who halfway understands the actual meaning doesn't understand the implications of becoming more socialistic.  When I hear a young person say something like, "So what's wrong with that?"  I just cringe.  This is the result of a failed educational system.  These kids just don't get it, because they have been taught so little real history - but just PC mythology.  It's frightening.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Example is the post below me listing social institutions.  The programs listed are "social programs" which may or may not have the "socialist" agenda involved.  It isn't the same thing, as so many here are assuming.<br>  <br>  By the way, I have lived in two socialist countries.  I know what I'm talking about.  Both have "socialized health care", free to everyone.  In both cases, the quality of care is inferior to the U.S. by all accounts. In both cases people wait so long for an appt or a surgery that they often die, when in the US they would have received timely - albeit excessively expensive - care and may well have survived.  In both cases, people complain how much they hate their doctors, and don't have the power to choose different ones.  <br>  <br>  People, as I said, under 35 or so, have no idea what it means to live in a socialist country.  The government controls the media, the government controls education, the government controls banking and business.  If you want to build your own business or try to make it as an artist of some kind, it's near impossible in a socialist system.  In every existing socialist country, unemployment is consistently higher than in the US.  Taxes are higher.  Suicide rates are generally higher.   If this were the same type of country as France or Denmark, you would all be told at age 12 or so what "track" your education would take.  You would not have a choice.  Want to be a doctor, but you're better in English?  Well, then you'll find yourself on the non-science track, and you can forget medicine.   Want to be a writer or journalist?  You'd better not have good math scores, because the govt will send your education in a different direction.   Someone below talks about "affordable college education for all who qualify".  That would be great, but in a socialist country you don't GO to college unless the govt. thinks you are a good investment to begin with.  B's and C's?  Forget it!   Do you know how hard it is to pass the college entrance exams in France and Denmark?  How many give up brokenhearted??  And these are the ones who received the green light to even TAKE the damn thing.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on.

People believe that the government can help them are very naive and probably have never been to Sweden, Denmark or France.  I am particularly amazed at the people who cite the statistics that socialist countries are happier than Americans.  Those results are not only false and biased to make American capitalism look bad, they do not tell the real truth:  Those countries are taxed heavily, most of their wage earners are either rich or poor, and prostitution, drug addiction and alcoholism are the exception not the rule.  In addition, the good people of Denmark, Sweden and France are being overrun, terrorized and victimized by radical Muslims who hate anyone who does not worship allah.

t8BGljYWaa	I think there a few things worth pointing out.<br>  <br>  First, I hope we can agree that for all intents and purposes we live in an entirely naturalistic universe. That is, that the physical reality we interact with is governed by absolute physical laws, and has evolved continuously under the same laws from some set of initial conditions.<br>  <br>  Now life, as an institution, seems to me to be quite a clever way of organizing to resist these physical laws -- chief among them the second law of thermodynamics. So the evolution of life, and then the evolution of thought, and the simultaneous evolution of society -- all of these are methods of organization that happen to be very effective in a universe that works the way ours does.<br>  <br>  So here, I have defined life, and thought, society, and even evolution itself as processes separate from the "objective" conditions of the universe (i.e. the laws and the initial properties) that happen to be selected for because they are very effective; because they allow for tremendous resistance to the second law of thermodynamics. These processes, or systems of organization, are therefore by their definitions derivative -- not reflective of nature itself.<br>  <br>  What I'm going for is that even these very fundamental things you take as objective are -- in a mathematics analogy -- merely the gradient instead of the vector field itself. That is, they tell you a lot about the way the universe works, but they themselves aren't the actual letter of the law.<br>  <br>  And of course, if the organization of society is a construct, than of course the various perks of society like morality and altruism and value are also constructs. Very, very meaningful constructs with 4.5 billion years of evolution and 5000 years of social evolution and the weight of human intellectual history resting on them, but still constructs. The universe doesn't decree that an apple has value; the apple's value doesn't stem from the laws of physics. How could objective truth have a term for value? Value relative to what? <br>  <br>  If you buy what I've said, and I doubt that you will, then you should see that value and all of these other things we use to guide our decision making are relative constructs human society grew into or made. The assigned value of the apple, or the thousand apples, or sharing the apple -- all of these things fluctuate from person to person a little and wildly across cultures. Either that's subjectivity, or you just happen to be absolutely right about the apple and 6.5 billion other folks are wrong.<br>  <br>  Now, I do agree with your point that there is an absolute reality that we interface with. For example, imagine that we're both looking at a green apple. I think you, I, G-d, and Spock from Vulcan can all agree that this apple is located in and takes up a certain amount of three-dimensional space. I think we can agree that it reflects light primarily at 550 nm or equivalent units. That said, there is no way any of us can "be" the apple or understand it fully. Rather, we have to experience the apple through vision, or taste, or touch -- and even if we experience it with the same cells and chemicals, our mental processes and past memories will still make that experience ours and unique.<br>  <br>  So, in conclusion, reality itself may very well be objective-- but this matters very little to us because we still introduce a ton of subjective variation into the process when we experience it. Our interface with the world is definitively subjective, just like our social constructs, but this doesn't mean that our subjective analysis doesn't produce valid insights.<br>  <br>  On a personal note, I've previously expressed to you my problems with your prose -- especially with your infantile characterization of opposing viewpoints. That said, I really appreciate the amount of time and thought you put into this.|`|wzwUcjvhaa	Why do I feel I'm living in San Fransisco smoking pot ,in the 70's?

The apple has some nutrition in it and it's good to eat.  (Not to mention that it has the power to keep the doctor away for a whole day!)  <br>  <br>  Stock also has an objective value, based on the worth of the company, how much money it might make in the next year or two.  The problem with stock is that its price can be manipulated, and like any investment it can be used for speculation, not its real value.<br>  <br>  In a bubble, people happily pay much more for something than they know it is actually worth.  You wouldn't do that with an apple.  They pay more because they know that in another week or another month some other fool is going to come along and pay even more!  So they buy this overprice stock, or real estate, and borrow money to do it.  Often they 'leverage' other investments that are similarly overpriced and were bought on credit.<br>  <br>  This works fine as long as the market is growing, but as soon as it stops, everyone rushes to sell everything and find that it was all based on paper, and the economy collapses like a house of cards.<br>  <br>  We never learn!  Capitalism is all about making money, however you can. There are no real ethics involved, anything that makes money is 'good' by definition.  And in times like the ones just past, it's easier to make money by buying and selling and dealing than by actually creating something of value.  The big money is all in speculation.<br>  <br>  After the crash of 1929, FDR created the SEC to enforce some simple rules about securities markets having to do with price manipulation, false reporting, insider trading, etc.  And we also discouraged speculation with tax disincentives.  This worked great for about 50 years.  Then the neo-conservatives came in and insisted on 'free' markets, and that regulations were bad because they kept people from making money just as fast as they could.<br>  <br>  I never understood the big draw of Ayn Rand.  As I see it, her books only sanctify greed and social darwinism.  If you're rich, you're a hero. If you're poor, you must be lazy and worthless so why should we encourage you?<br>  <br>  In any case, the way an apple is worth a thousand apples is if you paid 800 apples for it and you can get the next idiot to believe that it is low-priced at 1000 apples.  He will gladly pay 1000 apples, expecting an even bigger idiot will come along in a week and pay 1200 apples.|`|GgG0inaUaa	The value of anything depends on the value place upon it. Not only is an apple a thousand apples it is also the savior of humanity. With proper care and protection you can in fact feed the masses with one apple. Be careful, if this apple is this valuable then certainly someone will want to steal it from you and use it for evil. unless you are already using it for evil then they might use it for good.

This philosophy, as vested by players throughout this environment, places "the benefit of society" as prime missions of organizations (as well as of individuals). For organizations, "earning a profit" also prevails, rather is subordinated to the prime mission.<br>  <br>  Socialism, as any economic system, is like an evolving organism living under a generally adopted (by no means at all forced) and shared primary philosophy.<br>  <br>  Typically, such a culture as this, which today exists in various countries, can be pinpointed since you'll find at least a national health care system. Beyond that, any group of primary banks will generally intermix common appearance and shared services. Open competition exists and plays an important role, nevertheless the most successful players are invariably those that display the more upright public service image.<br>  <br>  Another evident product within such a system is that since organization and individual operate within quite the team motivational spirit, fascist controls are far less required (as compared to capitalism) in order to maintain general peace and happiness. Although, most fascist controls under Capitalism are indeed aimed at government revenue creation, and through the tool of "punitive" fines (often for violations of actual non-crimes, rather errors or lack of understanding of incredibly thick law books) and prison budgetary devices.<br>  <br>  A socialist economy promotes a very, very high level of individual freedom and expression. Anyone who claims otherwise on this point is ill-informed. After all, this is the modern and educated world, and stifling expression makes no sense to the human cause and aspiration.<br>  <br>  Today's and tomorrow's system of socialism can achieve an extremely high level of economic success and sound long-term stability. See Japan, Canada, Sweden, and France for leading examples.<br>  <br>  I think you listed a very good question here. I'm glad for the timeliness and opportunity to share and listen.<br>  <br>  Edit: A funny little tidbit... Living at home in a socialist environment sees far fewer interruptions of sales calls to the private home telephone. I guess it's seen as less than the best manners within respect for privacy. But, these little benefits added all together, I think, offer a great opportunity for day-to-day contentment and relaxation.<br>  <br>  Edit2: Tell Loaf of Bread and No Pinheads that if you put a dozen tuna in a tub with a gluttonous shark, it's a bloody mess. But take out the shark... And you got a lot of REALLY BIG TUNA.<br>  <br>  Edit3: Tell collegenebula that modern socialism does not "spread the wealth around." Modern socialism allows workers to keep and/or benefit from the fruits of the labor of their own hands - rather than donating it to the rich. In modern socialist countries, CEOs earn only about double the tenured worker - which is plenty for any human. And the CEO earnings stay in the country rather than being sent overseas to some tax haven, where the government also loses from the CEO's earnings.<br>  <br>  I hate to have to point out that manufacturing in Japan has laid American industry to waste for its inefficiencies and motivational demise.|`|UqLEMXAgaa	Capitalism is regressive and oppressive.<br>  It depends on how you look at it.<br>  <br>  This is my idea of America.<br>  <br>  Say 200 of us are arrested for looking for something to eat.<br>  The jail is full.

[Dallas Morning News, 6/26/00]<br>  <br>  "He specifically recalls pulling duty in Alabama," spokesman Dan Bartlett said of Bush. "He did his drills." Bartlett said the Republican governor showed up "several" times while in Alabama, where he transferred from his Houston Guard unit in 1972 to work for the unsuccessful Senate campaign of Republican Winton Blount, a friend of Bush's father. [Washington Post 6/25/00]<br>  <br>  The Truth <br>  <br>  Bush left Houston May 15, 1972 and went to work on a political campaign in Alabama.  His first request for a transfer on May 24 was denied because the unit was inactive.  His second request on September 5 to a different unit was granted.  He was issued a direct order to report on specific days to the base, which he completely ignored.  The order was issued on September 15 to report to then-Lieutenant Colonel William Turnipseed at Dannelly Air Force base in Montgomery, AL, on the dates of “7-8 October 0730-1600, and 4-5 November   0730-1600” His orders, dated Sept. 15, 1972, said: "Lieutenant Bush should report to Lt. Col. William Turnipseed, DCO, to perform equivalent training." [Boston Globe 5/23/00] <a href="http://www.cis.net/~coldfeet/doc11.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.cis.net/~coldfeet/doc11.gif</a><br>  <br>  ·         His Commanding Officer, William Turnipseed, says he did not show up. <br>  <br>  "To my knowledge, he never showed up," Turnipseed said last month. [Boston Globe 5/23/00]  In interviews last week, Turnipseed and his administrative officer at the time, Kenneth K. Lott, said they had no memory of Bush ever reporting. ''Had he reported in, I would have had some recall, and I do not,'' Turnipseed said. ''I had been in Texas, done my flight training there. If we had had a first lieutenant from Texas, I would have remembered.'' Turnipseed also reports that the then-squadron operations officer of the Alabama Guard also has no recollection of having seen Bush.(The New Republic 10/16/2000)<br>  <br>  “Furthermore, a spokesman for the Alabama National Guard estimates there were 600 to 700 members in the unit Bush was supposed to have served with in 1972. But none of these men has ever come forward to say he remembers Bush, and Bush has not named a single one of them.”(The New Republic 10/16/2000)<br>  <br>  ·         There is no official National Guard record for George W. Bush’s service in Alabama.<br>  <br>  “His official discharge records do not include any service after May 15 of 1972.  Indeed, Bush's discharge papers list his service and duty station for each of his first four years in the Air Guard. But there is no record of training listed after May 1972, and no mention of any service in Alabama. On that discharge form, Lloyd (Albert Lloyd Jr., a retired colonel who was the Texas Air Guard's personnel director from 1969 to 1995 and was hired by the Bush campaign to make sense of the governor's military records) said, ''there should have been an entry for the period between May 1972 and May 1973.''  Said Lloyd, ''It appeared he had a bad year.  He might have lost interest, since he knew he was getting out.'' [Boston Globe 5/23/00]<br>  <br>  ·         No one in the Alabama National Guard ever saw him. <br>  <br>  “A spokesman for the Alabama National Guard estimates there were 600 to 700 members in the unit Bush was supposed to have served with in 1972. But none of these men has ever come forward to say he remembers Bush, and Bush has not named a single one of them.” (The New Republic 10/16/2000)<br>  <br>  Even though members of the Alabama Air National Guard have offered $1000 to anyone who can remember serving with Bush, no one has come forward to corroborate his service, with the exception of an old girlfriend who says she remembers him saying he was going, but does not have any other evidence, essentially making it her word against Bush’s commanding officers’ and a lack of official documents as noted above.<br>  <br>  ·         Even the Bush campaign claims that he only showed up on a single day in November and made up missed weekends, not contesting the fact that he defied direct orders to appear on the dates stated above. <br>  <br>  “National Guard records provided by the Guard and by the Bush campaign indicate he did serve on Nov. 29, 1972, after the election. These records also show a gap in service from that time to the previous May. Mr. Bush says he made up for the lost time in subsequent months, and guard records show he received credit for having performed all the required service.” [NYT 7/22/00]<br>  <br>  The evidence to support Bush’s service on November 29, 1972 is highly suspect for the following reasons: <br>  <br>  -                      The document offered to dispute the claim by his commanding officers in Alabama is a single torn document that does not have Bush’s name|`|nfZHMuxlaa	I agree to what you said , though your example wasn't exactly an accurate one , I mean, if everyone knows that "Bush is a liar" its not due to rumours, People lived through his lies & knew he was lying from the first word he quacked . <br>  You can't hide the sun with words , Bush's lying is an (Over) subject ... we all knew he was lying & SEEN it . <br>  <br>  One of his biggest lies is the war on Iraq , I won't post links neither will I say why was it a lie ...

That is often done so there are no points on your license.  However, the fine is usually higher than speeding.  It's a money tradeoff for a lesser offense.  If the prosecutor will not cooperate you can plead guilty or take your chances with a trial.  If the later, I recommend you get a lawyer.|`|57IDs4byaa	I agree with Fishguy.

You must be the best of the best and you have to be reccommended for it from your supervisors once you let them know you want to volunteer for it. You must be able to do your PFT in the higher first class range, have higher Pros/Cons etc.  You should at least be a Lance Corporal and most of the time they want you to be on your current base for 2 years.  There are some things that are waiverable like the 2 yr thing.  (At least in 2002).  You also cannot be married unless you are a Staff Sergeant. If you have children, and you are  trying to go, the other parent needs to have full custody.   So if you havent even gone to boot camp, just focus on that for now.  Once you finish all of your training, try to excel in your MOS and make sure to either be a good example in your leadership or just don't get caught doing anything that will get you NJP'd of Pg 11.

Most small bills never got to court, as it costs more to collect than the bill is worth.  If you pay in collections, be very careful to establish the veracity of the bill, and track it back to the original bill.  Get everything in writing.  Check behind the collectors and make sure they removed the collection from your credit rating.  If they didn't, send copies of the proof of payment to the credit bureau.  Smart people pay collection agency's with Cashier's Checks from your bank.  Never pay then with a personal check, credit card, or debit card.

esOaJoqBaa	What battle are you referring to? Iwo Jima?|`|4088855415d3c30807d176d03d3e8922aa	The invasion of Iwo Jima began on February 19, 1945, and continued to March 26, 1945. The battle was a major initiative of the Pacific Campaign of World War II. The Marine invasion, known as Operation Detachment, was charged with the mission of capturing the airfields on the island which up until that time had harried U.S. bombing missions to Tokyo. Once the bases were secured, they could then be of use in the impending invasion of the Japanese mainland.<br>  <br>  The battle was marked by some of the fiercest fighting of the War. The Imperial Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified, with vast bunkers, hidden artillery, and 18 kilometers (11 mi) of tunnels.[4][5] The battle was the first American attack on the Japanese Home Islands and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the battle, over 20,000 were killed and only 1,083 taken prisoner.[6]<br>  <br>  One of the first objectives after landing on the beachhead was the taking of Mount Suribachi. Joe Rosenthal photographed five Marines: Ira Hayes, Mike Strank, Rene Gagnon, Harlon Block, Franklin Sousley, and U.S. Navy corpsman John Bradley raising the U.S. flag atop Mt. Suribachi on the fourth day of the battle (February 23). The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Photography that same year, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.[7]<br>  <br>  Within the next month of fighting, 3 of the 6 soldiers raising the flag were killed.<br>  <br>  After the fall of Mt. Suribachi in the south, the Japanese still held a strong position throughout the island. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi still had the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions, plus the 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death. On the night of March 25, a 300-man Japanese force launched a final counterattack. The Marines suffered heavy casualties; more than 100 were killed and another 200 Americans were wounded. The island was officially declared "secured" the following day. The number of American casualties was greater than the total Allied casualties at Battle of Normandy on D-Day.<br>  <br>  Even after Iwo Jima was about to be declared secured, about three thousand Japanese soldiers were left alive in the island's warren of caves and tunnels. Those who could not bring themselves to commit suicide hid in the caves during the day and came out at night to prowl for provisions. Some did eventually surrender and were surprised that the Americans often received them with compassion, offering water, cigarettes, or coffee.[8] The last of these stragglers, two of Lieutenant Toshihiko Ohno's (whose body was never found) men, Yamakage Kufuku and Matsudo Linsoki, lasted six years, surrendering in 1951[9] (another source gives the date of surrender as January 6, 1949).[10]<br>  <br>  The U.S. military occupied Iwo Jima until 1968, when it was returned to Japan.

There is really no-such thing. Large contractors BID for a position where if something high-speed comes up they automatically get it - no bidding at THAT point.

Watch all the Democratic Party supporters who end up with contracts, and watch how the media will ignore it. They could not see that Hillary Clinton MIGHT have a conflict of interest because of her husband's business dealings, but the media went after our local Republican County Executive because he owns a small piece of a company that won a low bid on a construction project. It was worth about 50K. The media has a major credibility problem.
k8ivyYfaaa	You can't collect sales tax on an item that is illegal.  By legalizing it, they can then assess a sales or use tax on the item, just like alcohol.<br>  <br>  The issue CA faces is that they cannot pass a law that contradicts a Federal law, which legalization of marijuana would.  In the event the state passes a law that contradicts or 'battles' a federal law, the federal law always superceeds it.  This is so stated in Article VI of the Constitution and has been backed by various case law over the years.<br>  <br>  Medical marijuana can exist, because the Federal laws do not prohibit marijuana for medicianal use.|`|V0rr15amaa	why buy it when it grows like a "weed"<br>  <br>  IF it was made legal back-yard marijuana gardens would pop up all over the place.<br>  It would be everywhere.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Many states already tax it, even though it's illegal.  If you are caught with it and you haven't paid the tax, it's a double offense.|`|0RuNbOGlaa	No argument, except the federal law still prohibits the use and selling of marijuana, no matter what state you're in, or the local laws of such state.

AA11313983	I would love to know where you heard that.  Get the loan through a bank, not the dealership.<br>  <br>  If you walk into a dealership and tell the guy you're in the Army, he's going to assume you have no idea what the car is worth.|`|zGVVxuFLaa	Many car manufacturer's offer a military rebate or a military discount.  Unfortunately, their dealerships often take advantage of military members because they have a consistent income.<br>  <br>  Unless you are getting some sort of promotional financing (which won't be related to the military but rather to the fact that they're trying to sell cars), you will nearly always get better rates with a military-oriented credit union (I like Navy Federal, and you can join if you are in the Army) or with USAA.<br>  <br>  The recommendation to take your base's car buying class is excellent.  I agree wholeheartedly.<br>  <br>  Please think long and hard about your budget.  Not only the car payment, but registration, insurance, gas & maintenance.  Many a young military family has killed it's budget by buying a car that they can't afford.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	There is no guarantee that you will get a deal or lower interest because he is in the military.  It will depend on your credit history and what you can afford.  Do not buy something expensive, do not go overboard, be realistic work out a budget and even buy used if you need to.  The Family Services offices free classes on purchasing a vehicle, take it.<br>  <br>  Usually there is dealerships around the bases that will try to scam you or ones that come onto the base and try to sell you unless they are done through the PX/Exchange itself.  That has a program if you are overseas when you return to the US you can get a car and it will be tax free, but you still have to finance it.<br>  <br>  There is also a used car lot on base called lemon lots where AD/Retirees are selling their cars, you can get some good deals there.|`|AA10123414	There is not law that says they have to give him a better deal for being in the military.

Ur1EbFYaaa	Neither. It's a Responsibility.<br>  <br>  To be specific, it's your responsibility. It is not owed to you by the government. It is not owed to you by your employer. It is up to you to care for you and your family. If you cannot provide health care for your family, it is your responsibility to submit your ego and ask your friends, family, doctor, and church for help. They however, are under no obligation to provide that assistance as it is your responsibility. If all else fails it is your responsibility to work three jobs and sell your possessions to pay for it.|`|n5wvy5FYaa	Yes, it's a privilege. As of what date and time did someone dream up it's a "right?"|`|SS1VReF0aa	Privilege|`|c3vPZfghaa	I agree with you. It should be  a privilege just like food, water, and life!  And when either of them grow at a faster rate than your wages, and gets to the point you can no longer afford it, you lose that privilege like several million more Americans will be losing the privilege to health care this year, even though they are working the same jobs.<br>  <br>  But according to pro-lifers,  botched abortions should have a right to health care.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	It is a personal responsibility.

And people should consider it this way.<br>  You see, in France, we have "free" health care, covering everyone.  It is paid for by taxpayers of course, but somehow many people seem to forget that, and see healthcare as a right that everyone is entitled to.  Even illegal immigrants (no kidding).  Too many people have abused the system for years.<br>  It's not a government's job to take care of its citizens; each citizen is responsible for taking care of himself/herself.|`|7B9a65xaaa	in america, health care is a privilege.

8gnp5Kkjaa	Because to deny a child an education is a violation of the law regardless of their legal status.  The Supreme Court decided that in Plyler v. Doe in 1982.  A 5-to-4 majority found that for a state to deny a public education to a child based on their legal status is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, as illegal immigrant children are people "in any ordinary sense of the term", and therefore had protection from discrimination unless a substantial state interest could be shown to justify it.  The children are here illegally most of the time because their parents brought them, so they really didn't have a choice.  Denying them a proper education would likely contribute to the creation and perpetuation of a subclass of illiterates which in turn would add to the problems and costs of unemployment, welfare, and crime.<br>  <br>  And to deny someone medical care would be the equivalent of doing them harm, which violates the Hippocratic Oath that every doctor takes.  Plus it is law in some places that a person entering an ER cannot be denied care.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	They only use the LITTLE services they are eligible for....and that's VERY VERY FEW! They have been banned from Government Programs since 1996 when Congress passed (and President Clinton signed) the welfare-reform law known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. From then on, only citizens or legal immigrants, such as those with a Green Card, were eligible for federal benefits.<br>  <br>  Federal law also bars states and local governments from extending those benefits to undocumented immigrants.<br>  <br>  Benefits for the Undocumented: the Exceptions<br>  <br>  Few, narrow exceptions apply. For example, undocumented immigrants are eligible for certain emergency medical treatments. They may receive short-term disaster relief. They may be immunized against communicable diseases. They may be served at soup kitchens or seek refuge in homeless shelters. Children of undocumented immigrants may attend public schools. But those same children are not eligible for the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers children of the working poor not eligible for Medicaid.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://americanaffairs.suite101.com/article.cfm/undocumented_assumptions" rel="nofollow">http://americanaffairs.suite101.com/arti...</a><br>  Undocumented Aliens Do Not Overburden Government Programs|`|PVFRP0Ztaa	well first of all the hippocratic oath is taken to secure that no one is denied their right to live.

In the historical context, everyone in this country is illegal except for the natives.  So to answer your question, they use the public services the same as we do.

28yMpUfSaa	*shakes head*<br>  <br>  ****<br>  <br>  Anarchism supports free association, opposes the state, and opposes hierarchy. (At the very least, anarchists oppose involuntary hierarchy; anarchists often try to create egalitarian alternatives to the semi-voluntary hierarchies too).<br>  <br>  There are several different traditions which respect these values, and usually recognize each other as forms of anarchism. These traditions borrow ideas from classical liberalism, from early socialism, from each other, and sometimes from other sources.<br>  <br>  People depend on each other. People tend to create their own voluntary social order, including free association, reciprocity, mutual aid, and, if necessary, mutual defense. Once people create this order, a state, or any other criminal gang, is in trouble. So the state, to preserve itself, must preempt voluntary social order.<br>  <br>  ****<br>  <br>  So, among other things, anarchists oppose statism, corporate-welfare capitalism, nationalism, patriarchy, war and borders.<br>  <br>  Anarchists tend to support mutual aid and institutions which make that possible, potentially including labor unions, mutual-aid societies, mutual banks, various exchange networks, etc.<br>  <br>  ****<br>  <br>  Highleyman, "An introduction to anarchism:"<br>  <a href="http://www.spunk.org/texts/intro/sp001550.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spunk.org/texts/intro/sp00155...</a><br>  <br>  Danny OKC, "Anarchism, 3 minutes at a time," (part 1)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H0LYUQIPUU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H0LYUQIP...</a><br>  <br>  "An anarchist FAQ:"<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/193...</a> or<br>  <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infoshop.org/faq/index.html</a> (same text)|`|XxSj6AsBaa	Republican ideology supports less government interference, not no government.

So no, I would not want Anarchy to be a way of governing.<br>  <br>  For some reason perhaps over the last 50 years or so there has been a constant miss use, and miss understanding of what government is. And because of this most people have been lead to understand that government is the end all and be all in a free society. Being free does not me you can do what you want when you want. It also doesn't mean that you have the rights of ownership to what you want when you want it. It means (at least for me, and most Repubilcans that I know) that you should have the right to pursue your life by your means as to how you see it. And that government should only up hold your rights while protecting the rights of others, provided there is no conflict of those rights. We see an abundance of conflicts today, which the Democrat governing party feels are rights and they will do what ever they can to force them upon us, which in effect is removing my rights over anothers.<br>  <br>  And by the way, Just wait, if things are left to continue in this path of heavy government and overt taxation and social fringement, you will see a world income tax that every person from every country, especially those countries with the means to pay, ie US must pay on top of the all ready over taxed producers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|YaTgrhr9aa	I would be happy WITHOUT Obama as President or having a Republican Congress with REAL checks and balances|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	isn't "anarchy government" like saying "diet sausage"....?|`|AA11702773	No, but we could move a whole lot further in that direction before the trend would stop delighting me.

KTM5JEkLaa	No.  This is completely a liberal move against conservative talk radio and Fox News.  While I agree that it is problematic that people don't seem to know the difference between news and commentary, stifling speech is not the answer.  To complicate matters, some Democrats in Congress have also proposed applying a "Fairness Doctrine" to Internet searches as well.  In other words, if you Google a political or news related website, you would automatically be re-directed to a website with opposing viewpoints.  Not sure how they propose to make this work, but it shows how certain members of society believe they can regulate and legislate a Utopian society.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	Nope....Conservatives are for free speech even if we dont like what is being said.....<br>  <br>  It is the Liberals that want the "fair doctrine" passed that will censor Conservative speech only...it is neither fair or a doctrine<br>  <br>  Libs want free speech...ONLY when they are talking...|`|BYeEVLDQaa	"invoke some horsepower"?

e0c51b39028498ec82e61c51a9b0b0e5aa	Socialism is a step on the road to communism.  Basically in communism you have no government.  Everyone shares everything equally with no need of a central power to oversee collection or distribution.  It is a classless, leaderless society where everyone works for the collective good.  Obviously it's a pipe dream, so socialism is as far as it gets in reality.  Socialism is the tenents of communism enforced by a "dictatorship of the proletariat".  In other words a person or group of people take dictatorial powers in the name of the people, and then define who gives what and who receives what.  Socialism is supposed to immediately follow the uprising of the proletariat, and is supposed to be a transition to the communist utopia.  We only need a government so long as people are deluded that private property actually exists.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	The classic answer to this since the early 1900's is socialists seek socialism through political, parliamentary means where communists believe in revolution and see no hail in trying to reform bourgeoisie institutions.<br>  <br>  Both socialists and communists do consider themselves socialist|`|QX2xnrhWaa	Socialism is supposed to lead to communism; it's sort of an in-between, a step between a free, capitalist society and a full-blown communist society. <br>  That's why when Socialists gain power in a capitalist country, you'll see a lot of private corporations bought by the government and becoming public; e.g.: what happened in France in the 1980ies, after Mitterrand (a Socialist) was elected President.|`|1910569d373fcf7d99adfc76f7917a32aa	In socialism, there are still elements of capitalism and a ruling government.

3ePXTcnoaa	I think it should be legalised for both situations. Although they should definatly have rules about driving whilst stoned etc.... It may even make people stop smoking it so much because it wouldnt be exciting anymore hiding it!!! But I definatly think it should be legal. Appropriate doses and rules will ensure safety of others. They should have designated areas etc. Like smoking, and only over a certain age should be able to smoke it! I think we should start a petition! Cannibis makes me relaxed and stop stressing so much, it helps me alot!|`|sc1CfIvpaa	It is and should stay illegal.

fa0KZ6bMaa	Of course not.<br>  1 . He wants to redistribute your wealth to those who don't want to work.  He apparently knows what's better for your money than you do.<br>  2.  He wants to nationalize healthcare and decide if you should or should not get a life-saving procedure because if you are too old or you didn't follow the "preventive" measures set forth by Obama's administration, you shouldn't expect to get much if any care.  <br>  3.  He will likely take over your 401K and IRA's because he knows what is best for your retirement money.<br>  4.   Most likely you will need to give up your weapons as well, because Obama won't stand for the citizenry being armed.<br>  5.  He will control the media, and will stamp out any opposing viewpoints, starting with conservative talk radio.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	Yes, he does understand liberty. He is a Harvard educated Constitutional Law graduate. If you actually take the time to read the Constitution, you would see that the document provides for a government to exist in order to strengthen the nation. Which is exactly what he plans to do. Bush, as all Republicans do, played favorites with wealth distribution and all the Obama tax "cuts" do is allow the Bush tax cuts for the rich to expire. And return the tax rates to what they were under Clinton. When the economy was functioning and the everyone, even the rich, got richer. <br>  <br>  I should ask the same question of you with regard to Bush, did he know the meaning of liberty when he deliberately ignored the due process of law (Constitutional amendment) when wiretapping American civilians? When holding, without charge and without proof, suspected "terrorists"? When deliberately lying to the American public to incite a fervor for war in Iraq which spends 350 million dollars PER DAY, amounting to nearly 3 trillion dollars thus far and several thousand American lives?<br>  <br>  Returning the tax scale to what it was when this nation was last run effectively is not a departure from civil liberties, rather the past 8 years of near fascism has been a gross misappropriation of the concepts of liberty.<br>  <br>  Also, where in the Constitution does it say that is your RIGHT to keep your money?|`|opOJPp9uaa	Consider this for a second. He is in a favor of a proposed bill that ,in effect, censor conservative talk radio. Last time I checked this was against the 1st amendment. This is a disturbing revelation. What other parts of the Constitution is he willing to throw out for his benefit. If he or any one else is offended by Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity, then don't listen to them. However to trample 1st ammendment is not only wrong but an impeachable offense. So that is what he thinks of liberty.|`|Hw8rr1TCaa	Of course not, Neocon. Obama is ignorant, he only graduated some Harvard University, ha, ha, ha, ha. Obama is also a Muslim, but somehow he goes to Christian church with "Racist pastor". Obama sounds as Osama. His middle name is Hussein same as Saddam's last name. Right children?|`|80Dyljhdaa	No, Liberty usually pertains to bodily freedom, not monetary freedom...So I'm guessing you really don't know what it means.|`|S33poz4paa	Don't take things out of context.  In the Constitution, the liberty they're talking about it individual freedom.|`|8DeRuAmYaa	that's not the definition of liberty, scrub|`|jBeWLkz7aa	Are You Sure the Right to Money is in the Bill of Rights?|`|q6ka1qEtaa	you my friend are a neo-con nut job|`|6Gfz125Paa	I don't think you understand what Liberty means.|`|m5J36D28aa	You're asking that of a constitutional lawyer?|`|ajrnlFczaa	Liberty to today's liberals actually means bondage.  That's what it means to Barry.|`|AA10331255	Obama does not think it's "fair" that you should keep your money when others don't have any.  He thinks you should give a lot yours to them.  That way no one has much of anything.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	I think he knows, understands and is one of Liberty's best supporters.|`|PCVJg5ieaa	I'm not sure you understand what  a liberty is?|`|RH8Ncf36aa	Actually you're wrong. Liberty when defined by the founding fathers meant political independence. Why don't you get a dictionary and look up also the meanings of 1700s words. If you can't use english properly then don't make accusations, especially against someone with more education then you most likely have. #2 the president is free to interpret the Constitution and apply it to whatever article he sees fit unless the congressional congress and Judaical branch see unfit. <br>  <br>  Youtube isn't a source, its a website that allows videos to be posted. <br>  <br>  Thank You, Sir for being an uneducated scourge to this nation. Also a president isn't usually judged till after the first 100 days, so shut up and wait.|`|KTM5JEkLaa	No, he doesn't.  My money is the fruit of my labor, time, and efforts.  To take my money is to take away my life and work.  I will gladly give up some for the collective benefit of sustaining our nation, but Obama believes the opposite.<br>  <br>  Also, the response above demonstrates how little people understand the Constitution and the philosophy of our founding.  The Constitution does NOT grant anyone rights, especially the government.  Rights are considered to be natural and god-given.  The Constitution PROTECTS those rights from government and points out the most important ones.  The government has NO rights; they derive their power from the citizenry and they answer to us.|`|33b29bdd98f8d8d34167893336d47bfeaa	Liberty doesn't mean you don't have to pay taxes, dude. The constitution gives Congress the right to levy taxes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Dude you said that the constitution gives you the right to keep your money -- false. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should rephrase your question if you want to debate the income tax.<br>  <br>  Not to mention - why are you blaming Obama for the income tax, which has been around for almost 100 years, under Presidents from both parties.|`|fd5924c397f5b6b2236018882cccd4a7aa	He doesn't care about liberty.

qt9rrk6xaa	You ignore history. <br>  <br>  Republicans have controlled both houses of Congress from 1995 to 2006. Republicans have controlled the Presidency for 20 of the last 28 years.

The country has doubted Democratic policies for more than a decade. <br>  <br>  Now at least 67 million voters think maybe that was a mistake.|`|3MM64geHaa	Most people do not prefer limited government, fiscal discipline and personal responsibility.

Checkbook republic will bankrupt us all.|`|n5wvy5FYaa	It defies logic.|`|q1DwPQzpaa	Democrat voters, in comparison to Republican voters, do not read as much or pay attention to what's going on enough to know who or what they're really voting for. They just press the button because there is a D next to that politicion's name. It's very sad. This is how Obama won, and Obama is the most fiscally irresponsible president in our history and he's only been in office for 2 months.<br>  <br>  On top of that, Democrats are the ones who promise to throw money at the ghetto population, the poor, the "underprivileged", which is usually also Democrat, while Republicans are the ones in favor of personal improvement and success. Which is easier: working and getting an education, or voting for people who give you welfare?|`|AJmCHSwmaa	Dems never promised these things, Obama promised to redistribute wealth, to put restrictions and red tape on businesses. Obama showed he hated capitalism, hated guns, loved control. People voted for him anyway. I agree most people want these things you listed but they voted for the opposite. The media also tries to show this country as being not for those things.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Because Americans are ignorant and lazy. We actually believe these promises during campaigns and shun any candidate that tells the truth.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	You're generalizing far too much.  It's too early to even make these statements about Obama because he's in full-on crisis mode, just doing his best to pick up where Bush left off.  Let's compare Bush and Clinton.  Of the two, Clinton was the more fiscally responsible.  He balanced the budget and he did it largely by cutting back on spending and decreasing the size of the government.  Bush did the opposite, increasing the deficit to nearly a trillion per year and increasing the size and invasiveness of the government.  Don't forget that the Department of Homeland Security didn't exist before he took office.  I think you need to do a little more research before acusing Democrats of not keeping their promises.  Republicans are the ones who promise the smallest government and most fiscal responsibility, but they've done the exact opposite of what they promise ever since the Reagan years.  After eight years of Bush's self-serving overspending, the majority of voters decided we'd had enough.  We want a government that puts the needs of the people first rather than putting millions in their own pockets by war profiteering.

ZTc7rE1Haa	No way. For a start, they have broken the law and should not be rewarded by being allowed to stay here. Secondly, we certainly don't need all the immigrants who have flocked to this country. The least we can do is to get rid of those who came here illegally.|`|M7GnRpd0aa	No most definitely not. They should be deported at once and not allowed all the appeals that they get. Why should the tax payer fund these appeals?. In my view they are criminals. Lorry drivers are fined if they are caught on their lorries and some of the drivers don't even know they are there. Why aren't the illegals fined as well?.|`|U8XTbQgraa	Should somebody who is not invited to your party who you have nothing in common with and has only gatecrashed your party to eat your food and drink your drink for as long as it lasts be allowed to stay.I think fcuking well not!Size ten up the backside for taking the piss is called for.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	NO.  They should found and deported.  Also, criminal immigrants and failed asylum seekers should be deported too.|`|DQpPRg9caa	It would simply encourage more to come and Britain is already overcrowded.

The fact that all of a sudden some dirt was aired on Palin right after her nomination does not surprise me in the least and I'm quite sure it was not a coincidence.  What is a surprise is that Obama is basically patting him on the back and saying thanks right in front of the whole world to see.  This is not a man that has a conscience and he is certainly a disgusting creepy low life that will stop at nothing to get what he wants.
AA10558731	As I understand it, the recidivism rate for sex offenders who are caught relatively quickly (i.e. after only a few offenses) is only about 5-10%. The other 90-95% do not re-offend and can thus be considered rehabilitated, even though they are forced to register annually as a sex offender for life.<br>  <br>  The 5-10% that do re-offend are considered to be habitual offenders and unlikely to be rehabilitated. These are, of course, the ones to watch out for since they are the ones who present an ongoing danger to the public. These are also the ones who generate most of the deservedly negative public opinion, leading to the popular misconception that all sex offenders are incorrigible repeat offenders.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the way the sex offender registration laws are set up means that many people who commit acts that are only vaguely interpreted as sex offenses are lumped into the same group as hard-core child molesters & rapists.<br>  <br>  There have been cases of a minor being struck by a car and being physically restrained from leaving the scene by the driver until the police could arrive, and the driver subsequently being charged & convicted of a sex offense against a minor for putting his hands on the minor and preventing said minor from leaving the scene of the accident.<br>  <br>  There are thousands of cases of 18/19 year-olds being charged with statutory rape of a willing (but underage) girlfriend only to go on to marry that girl when she gets older. This leads to a lifetime of sex offender registration and the accompanying stigma, even vigilante activity against him, often after decades of faithful marriage and no criminal activity of any sort, simply because his name is listed on a public sex offender registry.<br>  <br>  For these reasons and more, many believe the sex offender registration laws need to be revamped to focus attention on the serious & habitual offenders and reduce or remove attention given those who simply make a mistake in judgment or breach a technical point of law.|`|iR3wIKNZaa	I don't think sex offenders can be rehabilitated.They always revert to their old behavior.You can try to rehabilitate them,but its a waste of time and tax payers money.I did psychiatric nursing and worked with a lot of them and they always stay sex predators,some just hide it better than others.|`|2zGSdDvIaa	The recidivism rate for child molesters is 90%++.<br>  <br>  Many Psychologists will tell you that they believe the true recidivism rate is much closer to 100%, the difference being that some don't get caught again.<br>  <br>  For other types of sex offenders, i do not have any specific knowledge on recidivism so I will not speak to them.|`|RKUvBM9gaa	not necessarily. it isn't always a learned practice, it is a perversion and can be a disposition to sexual behavior.<br>  it wouldnt hurt to try to be rehabilitated though, i suppose

The only powers they have are the powers deligated to them by the constitution and they've gone way beyond them. These people are rightfully protecting the money THEY earned from being confiscated by people who can't even seem to live on $170,000/ year(CONgress gave themselves a cost of living raiseof about $5,000/year up to $175,000/year). If they can't live on that, it's no wonder the federal government is deeply in debt.<br>  More often than not when large numbers of people are finding ways around laws it is an indication that maybe there is something wrong with the laws. Instead of just assuming the people are greedy people trying to keep everything to themselves maybe they should look into changing the tax code.

Rush is the one who want to see Obama come to his show.  Obama see him as irrelevant.  Rush is a car crash that is sad, but everyone likes to see.  A person people love to hate, hence his high ratings.  <br>  <br>  Hey republicans you better do your talking point checks with Rush before you open your mouth or you might be apologizing the next day.  You have armored this guy even though he is not a politician, which is perfect, because he makes too much money and bring in too many people who listen to his program for the company he works for to fire him if he says anything reckless.  This speaks loudly to the republican situation.  They don't have anyone on the political stage who can give a clear agenda to the crisis we face, so they bow down to Rush to do the fear mongering and spew hate to rally the republican base, sad.|`|7Jke9kR3aa	I don't know if obama is afraid of Rush or not,<br>  I'm not a mind reader after all!<br>  However, I think it's funny that oftentimes liberals/democrats resort to name calling such as calling rush or conservatives hate mongers etc. without siting specific examples of this claimed hate speech. In my experience, when I try to have an intelligent conversation or debate with a liberal, I always try to treat them respectfully as I site specific examples of what I'm trying to dispute. <br>  But when the libs can't come-back with an intelligent answer, they oftentimes resort to name calling.

t3QAaSN9aa	Actual history shows that the Bushonomic and Reaganomic policies are responsible for our economic decline.  Bush pushed increasing home ownership for low income people while ignoring the need for regulation of the mortgage industry which was running amok.  <br>  <br>  Deregulation has been the Republican mantra for decades.  Republicans did everything in their power to make sure that there was little or no regulation of lending institutions that were making loans to people of modest means who obviously could not afford to pay them back when the outrageous APRs kicked in.  <br>  <br>  The illusion of the "booming Bush economy" led Republican economic advisers to ignore the housing bubble, ignore the declining economic power of the middle class, ignore the "creative" securities and financing schemes that were being instituted by Wall Street and to declare that all was well. <br>  <br>  The so-called attempts by Bush to regulate were really a powerplay move. Recall that Barney Frank supported the 2005 legislation when it was in committee but refused to support the last-minute Republican amendment that was added and therefore voted no. <br>  <br>  Also note that when Democrats took control of Congress, they passed GSE reform measures, in 2007, that were signed into law. <br>  <br>  Get your facts straight and be honest.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Liberal historians keep re-writing history so they don't have a clue what the truth is anymore.

He did add to the debt so that just causes more confusion.  <br>  <br>  I think Obama is right on one thing.  We need to do something about education.

That seems right.<br>  <br>  Put it another way: suppose that America was a country that didn't exist until after the Second World War, created by "mandates" from foreign powers. That new country, America, had large groups of Protestants, Catholics, and members of other religions who were accustomed to killing each other via homicide/suicide bombing, ethnic cleansing (depending on which group was in power and had the most guns) and were as corrupt as any people on earth had ever been.<br>  <br>  Then a foreign power invades us because they invented information to justify their desire to spread "THEIR" version of reality to "us.' And imposed their system of government on us, despite our centuries-long tradition of tribal and religious warfare. As we fought their vastly-superior weapons and almost 200,000 of their soldiers, we killed about 4,000 of them but they killed HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of "us," including women and children as 'collateral damage which we entirely regret but .... blah blah blah."<br>  <br>  Well, I hope you get the picture. OUR troops belong HERE. We are not fighting Muslims, we are fighting people who HAPPEN to be Muslim, just as if a foreign power occupied "us,' they'd be fighting Christians, not because we are Christian, but because we are "here." and HAPPEN to be Christian.<br>  <br>  This "Christian versus Muslim" rhetoric is pure hate-speech and is reminiscent of The Crusades of a thousand years ago.

If you don't plan on taking drugs whilst being a police officer then you will be fine.|`|TsGS4mIbaa	If you have to get a drug test, then it will show up if it's within 4 days of you taking the X. You can buy detox online which will cleanse your system if you have to get the drug test soon. But if you can wait 4 days, maybe 5 just to be safe, then you should be fine. Good luck!|`|gKYsmZRqaa	Some cops have come out of the dumps and have become amazing police officers.

I believe the magic number for smoking or doing drugs is 12 or 13 times. That is considered experimental usage.|`|eTBfsjCUaa	How in the hell will they know unless you tell them?

AA10818613	The Obama team is just pointing out something that is quite obvious about Rush and the GOP.  Seriously, the GOP keeps groveling at Rush's feet. They don't dare question Rush's positions because they know that their GOP base won't vote for them when it comes to re-election. The GOP has nothing to offer so they are allowing Rush to make policy for them and express their true feelings about Obama. A president who has a 68% approval level. The irony is that the more extreme Rush gets and the more Rush speaks for them, the further the approval ratings for the GOP goes down with independents and moderate Republicans. Actually, Rush being the leader of the GOP is helping the Dems ALOT!  Rush is a great gift for the Dems.|`|kzNnMrMHaa	This whole Limbaugh thing is a symptom of the liberals getting nervous. I love it. I hope Limbaugh keeps pounding on their pointy heads. Rush is but a commentator and does not represent the real conservatives in this country.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	It is a distraction from the economy and says Bush is no longer in public office the Democrats MUST demonize someone.  That's how they conduct business.|`|n4NdXUPfaa	Rush Limbaugh is like a car crash it sad, but you look.  His ratings are high not because most of the people are his agreeing follower, but because some people just love to hate him. <br>  <br>  If Obama is the Messiah to the democrates, then Rush Limbaugh must be the Almighty to the republicans. Hey republicans you better do your talking point checks with Rush before you open your mouth or you might be apologizing the next day.  You have armored this guy even though he is not a politician, which is perfect, because he makes too much money and bring in too many people who listen to his program for the company he works for to fire him if he says anything reckless.  This speaks loudly to the republican situation.  They don't have anyone on the political stage who can give a clear agenda to the crisis we face, so they bow down to Rush to do the fear mongering and spew hate to rally the republican base, sad.   <br>  Then the old republican tactic comes to play.  Fear, hate, guns, religion and race to distract you with them wanting to lower taxes for the rich 5% of the population who for every $1000 they give to charity get back 300% more than the middle class person giving the same amount; who likes to keep minimum wages low at all times while CEOs get huge bonuses; who passed bills that allow credit card companies to increase interest at an unbelievable rate, who make sure that contract go to contractors with connections with no transparency or accountability; who would allow a large portion of the American jobs sent to poor countries; who would stay quiet for 12 months about a recession, just not to take any accountability.  Sad.  Wake up.  Education -Health care-Jobs is what is important.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	Limbaugh is the leader voice and typical example of the conservative hypocrisy.|`|UXKMNkdgaa	Its just a smoke screen, we argue about Rush while Rome burns.|`|teeQmWsBaa	Everyone will be required to be beige [figuratively] you will  not be distinguished in any other manner from other workers.

They need a victim for their plans to be accepted. You cannot have victims without villains. The Limbaugh thing is just beyond ridiculous. That a President of the United States is going to waste time going after a talk show host is just laughable. We really haven't seen silliness like this since Nixon's enemies list. <br>  <br>  Adam B: Your statement regarding opinion poll data if true and I haven't bothered to check would be even more reason why the administration actions are just silly.By drawing attention to him they actually make Limbaugh more popular in the public consciousness not less. The reality is that the administration actions can only be explained in two ways. One is fear and the other is misdirection. Translated: They are afraid that through his actions, Limbaugh will focus more attention on their actions. Therefore he must be discredited and destroyed. Unfortunately for Obama, smarter groups than this administration have tried and failed in this area.

You are much to quick to make him synamous to anything republican and I don't understand this. <br>  Guns and religion are not a 'tactic' nor a 'distraction' they are actually both rights given to each of us in the bill of rights if you don't want to exercise you're right to- feel free, but don't try to limit mine please. <br>  The most talk of race and fear is coming from the democrats and you can not deny this at all. <br>  Don't comment on the tax or the economic situation, you are apparently not educated on the subject well enough to.

I am conservative, and I don't even listen to Rush.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I am a moderate, so I disagree with many of his ideas.  My Dad is a life-long conservative republican, but he also disagrees with Rush and does not listen to him.<br>  <br>  That said, Rush is only a political commentator, not an elected official.  He does not speak for all republicans or all conservatives.
6OLiuM9Gaa	My experience is about 50 years old. Back then Navy Boot Camp was 13 weeks long.<br>  <br>  When I was in, we were granted two weeks leave before having to report to our first duty station or school. We were allowed to make arrangements for transportation... I think it was the week before we graduated. <br>  <br>  However, I'm not certain about any leave today. It seems that some graduate at the end of one week and sometimes start their school at the beginning of the next.<br>  <br>  I don't recall any travel restrictions, but I went home for a week, picked up my car, and drove it to my school.<br>  <br>  We weren't given any travel money. We had been in three months. We really had nothing much to spend our money on other than to pay for initial uniform issue ("sea bag issue"). Some tried to save money by flying "standby" but I got a reservation.<br>  <br>  You'll have a better handle on the scheduling once you get closer to graduation.  You'll know where you're going to "A" school... and when. If you have any time in the interim, you might be allowed to take leave. But it's not a gift. You're allowed up to 30 days vacation a year. Two weeks takes about half of that.|`|0BoDF6iBaa	Yeah, you have to finish your A school and then you're authorized to take 2 weeks of leave if your permanent orders are in the continental U.S. If you get stationed outside of the continental U.S. you are allowed to take 30 days of leave.<br>  <br>  The Navy does not pay for your vacations.  You pay for those with your own money. In fact, 99% of the time that I went on vacation somewhere that I flew to, I had to show the Navy that I already paid for the plane tickets to get there and get back before they'd let me leave.<br>  <br>  When you finish your A school, you'll have your permanent orders and that will tell you where you'll be stationed.  For example, if you're in school in Great Lakes and your orders say you're going to stationed in San Diego, the Navy buys that plane ticket for you.  If you want to fly somewhere else "in between" traveling from Great Lakes and San diego, the Navy will reroute the plane ticket for you AT YOUR COST.<br>  <br>  For example, my order said I was supposed to leave school in Mississippi and arrive in Washington state by a certain date.  That plane ticket was paid for by the Navy.  Then I request that they redo the ticket so I could have a 2 week vacation in Nebraska, and they changed my plane ticket for me, but I paid out of pocket for the difference.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	There is no vacation, you can get leave if you have earned it and it is authorized.   You get 2.5 leave days per month, this includes weekends and holidays when you are on leave.  Usually right from Boot Camp you go to A School for months, you normally must complete A school before you can get leave.

Just pay the ticket and learn from your mistakes.|`|tPvjd8qqaa	A little clarification is needed to answer this properly.  Was the car on the street "on the side of" your house or was it parked on your yard?  I'm guessing it was on the street.  If it was, well, you will probably have to pay the fine.  I have seen where parking lots have been designed in such a way as to allow parking within 15 feet on one side.  After all, the fire department usually doesn't drive up on a lawn with their trucks to fight a fire.  <br>  It never hurts to challenge the ticket in court.  In your case make sure to show the magistrate documentation that you had just moved into the duplex.  He may let you off with a stern warning.

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Unless you are willing to commit perjury, you cannot say in your TBD that you were not speeding, so the odds of winning that way are nil.  Plus, if you then ask for a trial de novo, the hearing officer has discretion to deny traffic school.  If you really cannot afford the fine, then go to court, plead guilty, and ask for a break on the fine or the traffic school assessment.  The actual fine is pretty low, it is $35.  All the other costs are assessments added to it.  The hearing officer can excuse those assessments if paying them is a hardship.|`|AA10123414	You are not going to beat the ticket.

Perhaps you would be better off exploring that option.|`|DC4Civrvaa	I think you should just pay the ticket (or get an extension and pay it later) and pay the extra money to go to traffic school which you can do online and save the points from being added to your license.  If you don't want to pay the extra $10 fee for online payment, send in a check or money order and make sure to keep a copy of ALL documentation you send into the court including your check or money order.  The fee that is charged for online payment isn't by the court itself but from the company that processes the transaction and varies depending on the amount paid.  Yes it sucks, but the fee is well worth it if you are a procrastinator and wait until the last minute and don't have time to go and waste a day at the courthouse.  Obviously you were speeding even if it was a few miles an hour less.  I know how cops out here can be.  Do your best and pray to God that he helps you find a way to get ahead.  Good luck!|`|GdnQ81bbaa	It all considered a “privilege” for the convince to pay online and take a class.Times are tough especially and obviously in California. They need all the money they can get.Thus is the revenue for the state. You should ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. <br>  PS- I've been where you have and making a big pot of beans and rice will last a lot longer, cheaper and healthier for you.

n9mM979Yaa	the get both sides of the spectrum because the french.  if quebec everyone who votes bloc is either a gay man, or a woman.|`|mmgRYPeUaa	The National Post published an Ipsos-Reid poll conducted on December 2-3, 2008 asking whether political parties should receive public funding. They found that 61% of those polled opposed public funding, 36% supported public funding and 3% didn’t know or refused to answer the question. So was the move to cut public funding a political move by the Conservatives motivated by a desire to financially cripple their political opponents?<br>  <br>  Cynics, the opposition parties and the media would say ‘yes.’ For my part, I really can’t know the genuine motivation behind the legislation, but for me the much more important question, partisanship aside, focuses on whether or not eliminating party funding is a good idea or a bad idea.<br>  <br>  As citizens and voters, whatever our political leanings, we ought to look for anything that makes our voices heard on Parliament Hill. Parties ought to represent distinct points of view reflective of the party membership. Then when an election comes the voter has a genuine choice to make by weighing the various options presented by the party platforms. Too often, the parties in an election are chasing the same public opinion polls and disconnect themselves from the membership since they realize some or all of their members’ views are unpalatable to the public as a whole. This leads to political schizophrenia since parties may have public agendas for the election and private agendas that they tell to their party members in off the record conversations. Eliminating public funding and keeping the donation maximum relatively small will force parties to be very attentive to their party base and give voters a much clearer choice at the polls. It will also reduce the amount of money all parties have to spend on an election and I think that will also be a good thing.<br>  <br>  I think there’s another potential benefit. There are two ways a party can win votes in an election: a constructive mode and a destructive mode. In a constructive mode the party would actually make proposals that the public wants and thus gain their support. In the second mode one can so demonize the other parties that voters, without supporting your party’s platform, vote against the alternatives. The second kind of voter, who spends his political life voting against parties, will never donate to a political party because his issues and preferences are never on the table. I think the elimination of public funding for political parties will help them move away from destructive campaigning toward constructive campaigning and in my mind that would be a good thing.<br>  <br>  To me the puzzling thing about this whole question is why the Liberals, the most successful political party in Canadian political history, do not have the largest donor base. Perhaps a reader might have some suggestions to offer.

JOXQrsw0aa	Complete applications to each academy beginning  Junior year. An application to an academy  summer seminar also constitutes an application to the academy. USAFA opened for summer seminar applications Dec 1.  USMA opened Dec 16. USNA opened Feb 1. I believe all are still accepting applications for their  summer seminars through this month. USCG does not require a nomination but their summer seminar, AIM is also open. USMMA requires a nomination but it can be from any MOC(Member of Congress) within the state of residence. USMMA only has MOC nominations. <br>  <br>  Go to your MOC(Senator's, Rep's and VP) web page and in the nominations  section there should be a questionnaire or form to submit to ask for a nomination. It usually asks to rank  the service academies being applied to in preferential order. The  nominations are not usually submitted to the academy till late January, and there is communication between the various service academies congressional liaison office and the MOC. The MOC is aware if any LOA offers are issued before the candidate is notified and before the time he has to submit nominations. <br>  Also important to determine if MOC:<br>  1) names a principal nomination and ranks alternates<br>  2) names a principal nomination and does not rank alternates<br>  3) names unranked alternate nominations<br>  If a principal nomination is named and he is found fully qualified, he gets the appointment regardless  of  whole person scores of alternates. If the principal is not found fully qualified, the next highest ranked alternate gets the nomination regardless of whole person scores of alternates.<br>  <br>  About 25% of MOC name principal nominations.<br>  <br>  Each MOC can have 5 nominated cadets at USMA, 5 nominated cadets at USAFA, and 5 nominated mids at USNA. 5 nominated mids at USMMA  at any point in time.  For each vacancy due to graduation or other separation, he can nominate 10 candidates. <br>  <br>  Those candidates receiving LOA's are not charged off to the MOC as one of his 5 nominated cadets/mids. <br>  <br>  Candidates who do not receive an LOA then compete within their nominating sources for an appointment.<br>  <br>  As the academy learns which offers of appointment have been accepted/declined, fully qualified candidates compete nationally for appointments  according to whole person score till the class is filled.<br>  USMMA Mids can direct commission to any service branch:<br>  <a href="http://www.usmma.edu/military/" rel="nofollow">http://www.usmma.edu/military/</a><br>  Good Luck!|`|u5b3IsE3aa	yes, i did, and was accepted to all 3, didn't apply to the coast guard or merchant marines though.  the nominations are for academies in general and you can have them sent to all.  the applications are individual schools and must be sent to them with nominations attached.  so on and so forth.  have fun...  personally i would recommend rotc:)|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	Yes.|`|cEFiOrX5aa	It sure is.

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	No excuse, as everybody here agrees.  However, if the citation is for driving solo in the carpool lane (and not for driving over the double yellow line to enter the lane), don't worry about traffic school.  The offense is not a DMV point and will not affect your insurance.  Save traffic school for a citation where it would help.  Just pay the fine.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	I doubt that the judge would view that as a valid excuse for using the carpool lane.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	No, that would not be considered a legitimate reason for driving alone in the carpool lane.  It is your fault your gas light was on.  It is your responsibility to fill up your tank of gas so you can get to your destinations safely.

YOU pulled into the handicapped spot. He couldn't "block you in" if you didn't pull into it. You didn't have your license on you. The law states you must have your license on you at all times you drive, "I forgot" is not an excuse. If you have actual valid insurance you'll get out of that one (I suspect there's somethig you're not telling us here, why would they cite you for insurance if you actually have it?) but either way, you have no case to fight. Basically, it's only one moving citation and a bunch of fines for the other things, they're not points on your record. But I suspect you think you were in the right and the cops were in the wrong (since you were 100% compliant) and will try and fight it. You will lose and have some very nice court costs piled on top of your fines. <br>  <br>  Quit blaming everyone else for your mistakes and take responsibility and you'll sleep better at night.<br>  <br>  PS - and there was no "unreasonable search and seizure" like the other idiot is guessing. It was completely 100% legit and reasonable.

As was intended by the founding fathers of our American nation, the decision as to how many people a state legislator will represent is, like most other questions of how to govern, ultimately up to the citizens of that State.  This is a concept known as popular soveriegnty, and has its most famous American expression in the words "We the People" in the preamble to the Federal Constitution.  But, how each State does what you are asking is usually something decided long ago in their State Constitutions, and most have always been different from State to State.  However, these provisions can and sometimes do change usually by a process enumerated (i.e. written) in the State Constitutions.

It's going to get that bad.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No, because I don't think it will happen.  I think the only people claiming a raise in capital gains taxes will cause another great depression are rich people that actually have to pay capital gains taxes.  I think they are using this "Great Depression" talk to frighten average Americans into protecting their own lower tax burden.  I also think many lower class Americans are tricked into also fighting rises in capital gains taxes because they foolishly accept whatever conservative spin doctors tell them.  I think these concerns for Obama's tax changes come from personal greed more than actual concern for what will happen to the economy.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	You don't get it, do you?<br>  <br>  Come back when you get over this bitter hate you have.

Since it "looked bad," GOP leaders asked him to resign and he agreed to do so. Democrats demanded a criminal investigation of the entire GOP leadership for "covering it up."<br>  b) A Democrat Congressman was drugging and a$$-raping MINORS on his staff (not disputed - he absolutely DID it.) The GOP leadership asked him to suspend from legislative activity until an investigation could be completed since it "appeared" there were crimes involved.

fAaLjlI0aa	You should always plead not guilty in *any* initial court dealings. That's why he advised you as such.<br>  <br>  As for your ticket: Take the valid registration into court.

Simply go in and present the facts and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  And to Rock Firestorm: It sounds as if you did not actually read the details prior to answering.

ZhZOckPPaa	Yea its so much better giving in to the government, If you work till your seventy making lets say making $20,000.00 per year, pay your 7.25% social security tax plus the 7.25% match from your employer, (remember this is your money at this time. This would be $150,800.00 you paid in to Social security no interest at all, now we will assume that you will still be able to collect this at 70 years of age lets say 1500 per month. You would be 78 when you ran out now most do not live to this mark but at 6% annual return at age 70 on $150,000.00 you would gain around $10,000.00 per year as it is, with still no interest collected on this through your whole Life time.

Playing the stock market is no different than regulating the flow of assets in a well planed timely manner.

Obama should not be afraid to speak his mind, and refusing to debate Limbaugh (which should only take one day) makes him a coward. Biden is the VP and could just take over for the time that Obama is absent from the presidency. This absence is free; Limbaugh has offered to pay all expenses.

3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	When you have an economic crisis then leaders should respond with sound economic solutions, not political interests!<br>  <br>  In this case you had excesses of home building, excesses in unqualified loans, poorly understood mortgage backed securities with excessively high ratings.

People who believe they should have the right to bear arms aren't paranoid delusionals, they're mostly people who can see the consequence of banning gun sales.  The criminals will STILL find ways to get them and law abiding citizens who simply want a handgun to defend themselves in the event of, say for instance, a home invasion, want to be able to defend themselves in the likely event that their attacker has a gun and means to do them harm.  Last time I looked, we are still allowed to defend ourselves when attacked.  Think about this:  Someone breaks into your home and your family is in the home.  The intruder is not there to have tea and cookies.  They are threatening to kill you.  Would you rather have a handgun to defend your family or would you just take your chances on defending your family with words and perhaps a lamp from the nightstand (I guarantee the intruder has a weapon and will use it).  <br>  By all means there needs to be stricter enforcement of gun sales and people who carry weapons should be (and are) required to have a permit to carry them.  The criminals ARE going to have weapons, guns etc.  It just means right NOW, we have a choice of how we want to defend ourselves should we be held up, burglarized, attacked, etc.  THIS is what the "paranoid delusionals" as you so choose to call law abiding citizens who want to be able to defend themselves are "afraid of".  Losing that right.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	They take this away then what is next?  Will you be concerned then?|`|VgOCLskYaa	We are not afraid of anything. We just are not going to comply with "gun control" and that is a fact. This creole girl is prime example of what we as a nation are going to have to fight the Obama supporters for. Isn't this statement" quit hiding behind the constitution" just what the liberal and Obama believe that they are above the constitution I mean the total ignorance that anyparty is above the constitution it then is time to eleminate them.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	It's not a question of being afraid.  It's a question of exercising our constitutional rights:<br>  <br>  "The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." <br>  <br>  NOTE:  It doesn't say, people can keep and bear arms if the government says they can or if they obtain a permit or if they're nice people or ...<br>  <br>  Simply put.  The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.<br>  <br>  For the rest of you pansies, if you don't like what the Constitution says, then put forth an amendment that makes an appropriate distinction.|`|y2ywR3X9aa	I think everyone knows that criminals will get firearms regardless of any laws that are passed. If they followed the law they wouldnt be criminals. When you take away a persons ability to defend themselves it is much easier to control them. I am not comparing anyone to Hitler but one of the first things he did when he came into power was take guns away from the citizens. It is a slippery slope when people are way too willing to give up their rights. If one by one each constitutional right is taken away what will be left? You wont be able to say what you think, watch what government doesnt want you to see, and have no way to defend yourself. We are not too far from that as it is.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	Yes, some felons get guns.  They should not have them (by law.)<br>  <br>  Mental people also should not have them (by law.)<br>  <br>  The law abiding citizen of America is guaranteed by the Constitution the right to bear arms.<br>  <br>  Why don't you leave us alone?  Why do you want us all unarmed?<br>  <br>  I wish a teacher at VT had a gun in her desk.|`|imtw3gNwaa	Apparently, you have never read the Bill of Rights.<br>  <br>  I am NOT a "gun nut"... I am a US Citizen, who, per the Bill of Rights, has the Right to bear Arms... get it?<br>  <br>  Your little thing about assault weapons proves my point... the 2nd is not about hunting... it is about defense, defense against those who wish to do us harm, and likely have much more than a hunting rifle... why do libs have a malfunction with double negatives, and with the phrase "shall not be infringed"???<br>  Both are rather simple to comprehend.|`|YaTgrhr9aa	There is gun control in Chicago, works great right? <br>  <br>  Chicago has one of the highest murder rates, highest gang violence, highest gun related robberies, oh did I mention that Obama organized the very neighborhoods that the crimes are committed in?|`|VOccyg7daa	That's why we have checks when it comes time to purchase a gun. However, criminals buy their guns on the streets and don't go through those checks.

Advantage me on my home turf.|`|AA10742996	The problem is that no matter what laws you pass they will break them. Thats why they are called criminals. They will easily get guns (just look at drug laws) but law abiding citizens won't have guns to defend themselves.|`|K1iUzewyaa	maybe some people like you don't need to own guns.. but for the rest of us who like our freedom, we will continue to exercise our right to bear arms...|`|kJM65nXJaa	It makes them feel more manly. If some how gun were restricted, I'd suggest we all buy stock in Viagra. The answer is they are all fear based.|`|YTJ5Upneaa	They are not gun nuts, they just believe in the basic rights provided for in the constitution. If we start banning certain guns that takes us down a slippery slope of banning all guns. Most have no problem with things such as background checks and a waiting period. However banning guns does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of the criminals, they get their guns illegally anyway. If you take guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens they cannot protect themselves from the gun toting criminals, who got their guns off the streets.|`|OklApvU6aa	you are right..people like you should never have a gun|`|y3XaJhhAaa	I guess they're afraid of if they make gun ownership illegal it will some how stop them from buying already illegal fully automatic weapons? Lol.<br>  <br>  Honestly, they're just ignorant. Obama or nobody else not even god can take away gun ownership of legal weapons, and for those who aren't convicted felons.<br>  <br>  Basically, its just something anti Obama people can't whine, *****, bleed, moan, and piss over.|`|6YADkFr7aa	I am so glad you ask my assault rifle is for my protection and defense of my family and if I was a criminal you can buy a Uzi for 50 usd in Miami. So that why I have one. You sound like a very intelligent lady if I was your brother and you were going to be killed or raped I don't think it would matter if it was a assault rifle who killed or injured your attacker. Would it?|`|TItRpckpaa	This is the problems with liberals, they act on emotion, not logic. <br>  <br>  They dont think the constitution is anything to be paid attention to. It is carved in stone that no president can EVER take away our right to bear arms. <br>  <br>  People dont rob liquer stores with a gun if they suspect any one of the customers might be armed as well as the clerk. <br>  <br>  In places where gun control is more lenient and people openly or conceal/carry a firearm there is not the amount of crime we see in CA.|`|079441401751807c99ebbf1944a12281aa	When that paranoid delusional as you put it, comes after you, what are you going to do?

People want the cheapest price. Most people do not care where the product comes from just as long as the price is low. Some companies have tried to sell only made in America goods and could not compete because of price. American made goods usually carry a higher price tag. The average person doesn't care where the product comes from just as long as it is cheap. Look at Wal-Mart, a vast majority of their products are imported. People shop there because of low prices.

They made a record profit of $14 billion last year, while people lost their jobs cause of gas prices, while freight businesses closed for the same reason, while Exxon fired people and while Exxon create no job. <br>  <br>  Those tax cuts are needed.

The answer is lack of content, substance and a general negative tone expressed. Conservative radio examines policies and positions. This is indisputably done from a conservative stand point, but it does present statements from the opposition to support the analysis being given. Additionally the positions are usually presented with an upbeat facet. If you have ever listened to liberal radio there is little support presented for the analysis and the content is generally very downbeat. Ultimately people are looking to be entertained and liberal radio fails miserably in this area.|`|Rvl6JPZraa	Money talks and BS walks.

Just as the programming from one market to another has begun to resemble one another...so too have the business models.<br>  <br>  Radio exists because of advertising.  Ad time only has value if the programmer can prove that it has a quantifiable reach to a quantifiable demographic.  Contrary to the stratification that has been popular over the last several years, the concept of "liberal unity" is still to be proven.<br>  <br>  Conservatives by nature are "buyers."  The want something in which they can believe; they want something around which to rally...this works for both political ideology and products.  <br>  <br>  Liberals by nature are "sellers."  They want something that buys into them.  They want their voices to be heard and given the same value as every other voice.  For someone trying to pin down a "target demographic," this is a problem.  How do you sell "dolphin safe tuna" ads when the audience contains Vegans and PETA supporters?<br>  <br>  Forget radio and look at the world of Cable TV.  Note that "specialty' networks like Food TV have a solid and growing base of viewers, while the Gay & Lesbian Networks are struggling to reach viewers beyond their base.  <br>  <br>  Is it because TV is homophobic and addicted to pastries?

There have also been numerous articles written on the topic in Time, Newsweek. . .  It is all in what you read/listen to, and who is doing the writing/speaking.<br>  <br>  FACT - the Bush administration was cutting taxes left and right, taking in over $10 Billion less in taxes EACH YEAR OF THE TAX CUTS, and yet spent more money over those same periods of time.  <br>  <br>  FACT - the Bush administration more than doubled the national debt during his administration - so he did in 8 years what 30-some other presidents did.  Yeah, I guess that makes him very good at something. . .<br>  <br>  FACT - bottom line is this is not an issue of Democrats/Liberals and Republicans/Conservatives.  This is an issue of Americans.  And Americans are all suffering because of this mess.  I think that we need to stop trying to blame the other guy and start finding an answer to all this.

I cant believe the answers on this.|`|ZhZOckPPaa	He will not take the responsibility, Democrats said they would bring down gas prices if you put them in office in 2006, they managed that, When Bush told congress they needed to get a hold of the banking industry that was out of control, the Democratic congress stood up and said there was nothing wrong with it, right up to the point that two months before the collapse of the banking industry, Barny Frank starts telling people it is good to invest in Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac, do it. When Clinton removed the Glass steagle act back in the late 90's this opened it up to make these banks so called (to big to fail), but of course all you hear is that this is Bush's fault. It is Both parties fault and we are being taken down the same road (Socialism). Apparently we need to be as rich as they are, you know all the ones we send aid to. Because we are the richest nation on earth soon to be as rich as any other socialist/communist country. And who will be here to send aid our way? Demecrats pounded how bad the economy was for eight years, even after the news and sources you mention, after a while people started believing it and started tightening there pockets, When people do not get really educated they can only judge and or vote on what they have heard.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	He will only take credit for what he thinks will make him look good and his idiot media will go right along with it.|`|1cfMOZ36aa	bush was done in by a long unpopular war. also the big gas scandal is number 1 reason we are in a recession.<br>  <br>  <br>  to this day no one can figure out why gas went so high. only thing for certain is there was no reason gas every went as high as it did. <br>  <br>  it was a bunch of scammers that took advantage of a opportunity.|`|99a6c52cfb9842cdf983abb381e0fbf8aa	Right now Obama and company have a blank check written by the dip in the economy.  That dip was caused by the banking crunch initiated by policies set up by democrats for the last 30 years.  Just like the S+L problems in the 80's, the Democrats meddled with what works and created something that did not. The banking problem was created by government meddling not a lack of regulation.  George Bush made a dozen attempts to get congress to do something about the Sub prime lending problem because it would be the tax payer that would end up paying the bill.  Why should the Dem's worry?  They have always had the press on their side to help blame everything on Republicans so they don't care.  Now they have been rewarded for their misdeeds by having absolute power granted to them with a ready made scape goat (George Bush) to blame every bad outcome on.  So they are gona shoot for it all.  No amount of spending will be too big because it is all Bush's fault!

They are made after the opposition files a motion to dismiss.  If you want to appeal, you address the issues raised in the motion.

27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	Because Northern Ireland is not part of it. The IRA has officially now disarmed, but there are still hardliners who will continue to attack Britain until Ireland is an island nation.<br>  <br>  *edit* The conflict was very similar to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict today. Sure, it was partially about religion, but it was mostly about colonizers and subjugation. In the 17th century Ulster (mostly Northern Ireland) was settled by Protestants in order to "pacify" the Catholic Irish. The Catholics HATED the Protestants for siding with the British who were opressing them (i.e. the potato famine. There was plenty of grain grown in Ireland to feed the Irish, but all the grain was shipped to England. The Irish got none, and starved), and the Protestants hated the Catholics for not doing what they were told. <br>  <br>  When the Irish civil war came about the country was divided primarily along nationalist lines - the Protestant settlers viewed themselves as British (many coming from England and Scotland) wheras the Irish saw themselves as different. So whilst the split was also primarily along religious lines it was also along nationalist lines.<br>  <br>  Protestant and Catholic emnity was still rife in Britain until relatively recently. Just look at football. Most major cities have a Protestant team and a Catholic team - even if not many people know this today. Liverpool is Catholic, Everton and Protestant. Manchester United are Catholic, Manchester City are Protestant. However the only place where that really matters today is Glasgow, if you're a Protestant supporter of Catholic Celtic you are in a huge minority - likewise with Catholic supporters of Protestant Rangers.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Isn't that due to a Religious thing?

One could point out many inaccurate "facts" in his radio "rants".  But he is paid to have his opinion - not give fact-based lectures.  <br>  <br>  4.  If Rush wants to debate President Obama, he could always run for 2012 election. . .|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	What's in it for Obama?  Nothing even though he could make Limpballs look like a fool.  If Rush did indeed issue such a challenge then I chalk it up to Rush the entertainer looking for more publicity and monetary gain.

Rush is entertainment and it would be stupid to debate an entertainer and a person who has no say over policy or anything else.  Rush isn't running for anything and is doing this to boost his own profits and ego.  He knows full well that no President would do this.  Rush has anointed himself by proving the GOP has to bend over and hold their ankles any time they ruffle his feathers...anytime someone gives the slightest criticism of the guy...the GOP party members crawl back begging for King Rush's forgiveness.

Thats why he is sending his cohorts out to do battle and obviously getting slaughtered.  Obama is a very weak-minded individual and the evidence is coming to light. He should debate Rush to legitimize himself a President. Obama is not a fighter, but a turn and run type of guy when he gets called out.  Not surprising to me.!|`|Xzdyz8Kiaa	I think attending a debate with any such propaganda slinger would tarnish Obama's image, or anyone wanting respect of the nation for that matter.<br>  <br>  I'm right-wing, but even I can see where that would not be a smart move for Obama.

fslABgDnaa	I have to say one the most memorable things I saw at boot camp (1998) was watching one of my fellow females low crawl for 2 hours because she left her weapon in the latrine! I’ll tell you what – teaches you to make sure you don’t leave it anywhere!<br>  <br>  Low crawling is when you drag yourself with your weapon out in front of you along the ground keeping yourself as low as you can so you don't get your but shot off in the process. And yes - she did this for at least two hours - she was crying the whole time too - but it teaches you to keep your weapon with you at all times!<br>  <br>  This was her punishment for leaving it at the bathroom (latrine) when she was finishing utilizing the facilities (going to the bathroom).|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	OK, I'll give you another...<br>  My last name starts with a "W", another person in our squad who slept next to me Last name started with a "W"... One Sunday, while on the toilet, a runner came yelling my name and that the DI wanted to see me. I said give me a minute, he said now, so I power crapped, got my pants back up, reported to the DI who was standing between our two bunks. He had this long rod that he was smacking the other person's bunk with. Dust was flying up, the DI was yelling at me, asking what my excuse was for such a filthy bunk...<br>  <br>  He yelled "WELL!?" I replied that it wasn't my bunk. He then realized he asked for the wrong recruit. He apologized for yelling at me, then had me do 10 push-ups for having him yell for no reason, then 10 more for him apologizing.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	The first morning of basic when the DI's came in with the metal trash can lids to give us a wake up at o dark thirty in the morning to do some PT.  I nearly landed on my battle buddy flying off the top bunk.<br>  <br>  Also the first day we were there we had to drink a canteen of warm water before we went to chow.  Quite a few couldn't hold it down and the DI's made them drink another.  It was funny wathcing them try not to throw up again.<br>  <br>  Also one night during KP (you don't have to worry about that detail anymore) some fresh recruits came in and the look on their faces with the DI's yelling at them about which way to hold the tray was funny because I remember being in that spot just a few short weeks ago.
u23sBafTaa	It actually started with Carter !  You are right, most of the homes that are being repossessed are trashed !  If you can't save 20% down and get a loan (not a ARM) you shouldn't own  a home !  This proves that the people had no pride in ownership, or they wouldn't have trashed these homes !  They would have taken care of them !  I think it is insane to think that the rest of us should have to pay for this !  How long before we can't hang on, they are raising or creating taxes on everything !  We all know it is just an underhanded way to screw us in the middle class !|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	though in all fairness - the Government did gaurentee these loans and we are just seeing the fruition of this - So thanks Clinton and those along the way who did nothing to fix the regulation<br>  <br>  as well Bush kept the economy strong through the beginning recession handed to him from Clinton, 9/11, Katrina, 2 Wars, and Hurricane Gustav and was still able to keep our economy going and in positive growth. <br>  <br>  It was the American peoples irresponsible spending and credit habits and The Fannie and Freddie Debacle that things got to the critical point of destruction.  <br>  <br>  So if Bush was able keep things a float through 4 Historic and major catastrophes our country has ever known, and that was Historic in itself. Why does the left continue to run around saying Bush did nothing? <br>  <br>  Bush had some reckless spending habits but Obama is doing the same exact thing, if the left was helping to build the Bailout bill and were voting for and passing the bill (by a larger margin than the right). How was the bill not bi-partisan? <br>  House:<br>  Democrats: For 172 Against 63<br>  Republicans: For 91 Against 108<br>  <br>  Senate:<br>  Democrats: For 38 Against 9<br>  Republicans: For 33 Against 15<br>  Independents: For 1 Against 1<br>  <br>  Congressional Totals<br>  Democrats For 210 Against 72<br>  Republicans For 124 Against 133<br>  <br>  If we were against it then and now it has become out of control why should we support it now?<br>  <br>  Our economy is not getting better, and if we are making a Stimulus Bill to jump start the economy, and make jobs why is unemployment still falling? Where is the JUMP? Why are investors not investing? Why is consumer confidence still falling? <br>  <br>  If the Bailout was to fix the Credit Crunch and the Fannie/Freddie Debacle to get lenders to start lending again, people to start buying cars again and all that jazz then why are we spending money on a Stimulus Bill that has now become a Recovery plan and down payment on nationalized health care? <br>  <br>  We as a people had better wake up, it is essential we stop following around blindly and acting like we must go along with plans that go directly against the American Dream and Directly against the Will of God. <br>  <br>  It is possible to have voted for a person and then say hey I made a mistake, or hey I don’t agree with this person 100%. There are times He proposes something I don’t agree with, I mean shoot there are times God suggests things I don’t agree with, now I try not to disobey God but I have no problem disobeying a man even one I respect. I voted for Clinton the first time and realized I made a mistake, I voted for Bush and realized he was not near the conservative I thought he was in some areas, and during those times of disagreement I made it known, I did not sit back and say oh well maybe he knows better or blame Clinton for a bad decision Bush made. <br>  <br>  We are at an imperative moment in history and people better start swallowing their pride and quick or we will all fall, and fall hard.|`|GFdppnFHaa	Being irresponsible in this country has never looked so good, and being responsible sucks.

I need to go deeper in debt to buy an Escalade to deliver pizza's".<br>  <br>  The Republicans are playing this out perfectly as the democrats spend us into oblivian with bailouts that WILL NOT work.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	If we're doing exactly what Democrats want us to do....the why in the hell are Democrats so agitated right now? Every morning and evening on the news all I hear is one liberal reporter after another asking some Republican politician what they think about Rush Limbaugh.<br>  <br>  So why are they so interested? If they think we're doing what they want us to do....wouldn't they just be quiet? Your question has absolutely no logic to it at all, but then again you are a liberal so you don't need logic.<br>  <br>  You are scared and the liberal media is scared.<br>  <br>  Added: One quick thing. You mention "die hard" Republicans. What you mean is die hard conservatives. Ok, well go look at the results when Ronald Reagan won in 1980 and 1984. And your people say Obama had a landslide?? You libs don't know what a landslide is....because Reagan fired you off the roof those years.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	What makes you think Republicans are against people keeping their homes and savings? Of course they are. They are against the approach that the Democrats are taking, forgiving debts of people that lied on their applications, funding 2 million dollars for genetic grape research in upstate NY, (how is that stimulating jobs?) and increasing the deficit to double what it was under bush. (Wasnt it Obama that promised pork like Grape Genetic grants would be eliminated, and that he would rein in deficit spending?) <br>  The independent voter is not a liberal spender. Obama keeps it up, and he will push them back into the arms of the Republicans party.

Mayors also sign and veto legislation, and deal with municipal taxes, but don't have the power to issue pardons.

wCdfMZdFaa	There is an element of that.  Some of it is to appease voting blocs and some announcements do stimulate market secotrs.  For example, if Obama announces something along the lines of investment in renewable energy then certain metal companies, energy trading firms, turbine makers and energy companies become investment safe havens.<br>  Markets are fickle and traders are not always very bright.  It's one big bookies office.<br>  <br>  But very often spending announcements are often prior spending repackaed or spending that falls loosely in that area but will be punted off to a party friendly special interest group.  All of the above I suppose.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	Doesn't seem to be working very well.|`|IM30PoPNaa	Nope.  Obama knows that the DJIA is a poor measure of presidential performance.

Michael Steele needs to grow a pair and stand up to the entertainer Rush Limbaugh.  Steele was exactly right in his comment.|`|11dGXLchaa	No.   Whereas liberals believe only in free speech they agree with, we Republicans still believe in free speech for everyone.|`|AA11593971	So you're advocating murder now, Edna?

Maybe it was over the top --maybe not.<br>  <br>  Steele should never say anything about Rush --ever  Pro or Con. Rush doesn't run for office. Rush is a radio hype head. He's the conservative equivalent of Michael Moore and about as important in the whole scheme of things. Which is to say --no very.<br>  <br>  Steele should be preaching monetary control, personal responsibility, no excessive government, and no excessive spending.|`|mHdKANPNaa	Why?

Rush is a buffoon and speaks to an audience of less educated people.  He speaks like a 12 year old bully on the playground and his lack of self control is very childish.  He doesn't speak for any Republicans I know.|`|GOpDGnsXaa	What do you mean.<br>  Rush is top Conservative spokesmen per Rahm.<br>  Steele will stay out of talk show Hosts Business or be replaced Steele is well aware of this.<br>  Rush speaks for all the Real Conservatives like me.|`|sI3kqp7xaa	Michael would have to beat Obama to it first.<br>  <br>  Do people realize that a President is trying to silence a voice of opposition?<br>  Do you realize how dangerous this is?|`|G2PRIe3laa	Unlike Barry, Rush actually has body gurds that WANT to protect him.|`|gsKfSkJ1aa	Oh so you're not only a racist but also a traitor!<br>  What happened to freedom of speech?|`|8diTOnNiaa	to late he already crawled on his belly to him for forgivness|`|HmOdSP5Waa	Nope.

His excuse will be he has not been hired to do that & people are dying & losing homes & money & they need his time not a bunch of crack pots. Only a crack pot would chose to listen to Rush.|`|bTguVXMjaa	Get serious! Obama's too busy running the White House to bother with buffoons like Rush Limbaugh.|`|AA11593971	I think he'll say that Limbaugh is above his pay grade.|`|klj3cOFPaa	Probably the same one that any President would use:  Presidents need only debate other candidates for President.<br>  <br>  As soon as the Republican party nominates Rush Limbaugh for President, Rush will have a right to ask for a debate.

198434d88c92637a1ae4e0a736d6da5daa	If you want big change it takes fear. Obama is more interested in<br>  advancing his social liberal agenda then fixing the economy..<br>  He doesnt want to kill the counrty, just weaken it, somewhat like <br>  Germany prior to Hitler.|`|eYcNsptOaa	Wow, it didn't take long for you to forget that the problem was handed to Obama, he didn't create it, and to be fair, neither did his predecessor, the worst president in the history of mankind.  It was created by greed, pure and simple.  Greedy people who wanted to buy things they couldn't afford and banks that were more than willing to subsidize their lifestyle.  When people realized they could no longer afford what they had borrowed, through a variety of reasons, they stopped buying.  Once the consumers stopped buying, the rest of our economy took a hit.  <br>  <br>  Our economy will not collapse completely, the roof may have caved in, but the foundation is still there and can be rebuilt.  What we can't rebuild is an exact replica of what we had before.  If we left the markets alone, yes millions of people would be out of work, yes major businesses would fail, but that isn't all bad.  the employment is temporary, if the government wants to help by throwing money into anything, put it into unemployment. <br>  <br>  If there is a market for the goods and services that are no longer available because of business failure, someone will rise up to fill those markets.  If there isn't a market for the failed businesses then we are tossing money down a sewer pipe.  <br>  <br>  What we will end up with is a much stronger economic base and a truer economy.|`|P95YzHNxaa	In four years this country is going to be in a whole so big - we will never be able to dig our selves out of debt.  -<br>  <br>  Do I think his intent is to destroy the United States as we know it ?<br>  Yes I do !|`|YPV02h36aa	Would you do any better? seriously, he just started he needs time, with the 8 years Bush took to screw up its not going to be fixed in just a few months.

Most European countries don't believe that it's a good idea to take a convict and then expose him to several years of rape and violence.  Finally, many European states still believe in the concept of rehabilitation.  That's why their prisons aren't hell-holes like ours, and that's why their recidivism rates are lower than ours.|`|4Vmlf902aa	I hope not. You're not suppose to be pampering inmates.

However just because the jails are nicer the whole european justice system is different. The police will not hesitate to punch or hit suspects over here if neccesary. Also the police in most of europe are not as big on pulling people over. They rely very heavily upon roadside cameras to enforce most laws.

And Hatch of Utah should know better than asking that he get one for his state to off set the Dem that would always be elected in DC .|`|1f88iwfMaa	The District of Columbia is treated as a state for nearly every other practical purpose under the Constitution. If you take the meaning of "state" to its literal extreme, what you're saying is that the constitution does not allow Congress to regulate inter-STATE commerce with the District, that federal courts cannot operate in the District, and that DC residents cannot be taxed. Of course, the federal government does all of these things, outside the literal text of the constitution. The only time people have a problem with treating the District like a state is when it comes to representation.<br>  <br>  Additionally, the Uniformed and Overseas Voting Rights Act, passed and signed by President Reagan, allows citizens to vote from overseas even if they are no longer U.S. residents and even if they have no intention of returning. That means that people who have permanently abandoned this country, no longer pay taxes here, and do not aid in its defense, have a greater say in how the government is run than the people who live in our nation's capital. Taken to the literal extreme, this is also a direct violation of the Constitution that requires that representatives be chosen by "the people of the several States", but nobody seems to mind as much.<br>  <br>  And, just for the record, 600k people live in the District (larger than Wyoming, and almost as large as Vermont and North Dakota). I am a native DC resident; I did not move here. Neither my parents nor I work for the government, and we all pay taxes. Those who believe that nobody but federal bureaucrats live in the District are just foolish.<br>  <br>  As for those of you who believe that congressional representation requires a constitutional amendment, would you be willing to personally spend time lobbying your members of Congress and state legislatures to pass such an amendment? Somehow I think not...|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Zip.  But Barry doesn't like the Constitution anyway.  He is on record about that.  Yet people voted for him.  This is difficult to fathom.

I can maybe see helping some folks, but the idea of helping them because their homes have gone down in value irks me to no end.  My home is paid for and has lost value.  I don't see anyone running to give me a check for the difference.  Not that I want anyone to, but it's the same concept.<br>  <br>  Edit - Why is it so important that we stabilize the housing industry right now, in a panic, but we're not supposed to be worried about the stock market?  Reality is that BOTH will eventually recover.  Those who have lost value in their homes may need to stay put for a little longer than planned, but somebody will come along and scoop up the foreclosed homes and values WILL rise again.  Losing value in a home is simply not justification for bailing them out.  Citigroup, as horrid as they may be, has already announced that they will work with people who are unemployed for short term lowered payments of $500.  Beyond the temporary period, they'll work to renegotiate loans for folks.  I'm sure that other banks will begin to do the same.  Why does the government have to do it for people?  Simply put, they DON'T.  Those who bought more than they could afford should lose their homes and consider it a life lesson learned.  Everyone else WILL get through it.  It's a handy way to make the middle class appreciate welfare and to get them to feel a little more empathy for those on social programs.<br>  <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/090303/business_us_citigroup_mortgages_unemployed.html?.v=8">http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/090303/business_...</a>|`|rEwaVSnNaa	He's just buying votes for the 2010 elections.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	First off<br>  The house next door to YOU goes into foreclosure<br>  YOUR property value goes down<br>  <br>  sure some who don't deserve it will benefit<br>  BUT<br>  mostly the American dream will be kept alive by the plan<br>  <br>  <br>  Regarding those 3 million that couldn't afford the homes to begin with<br>  <br>  Do you think that lending THEM money was the turning point in the<br>  troubles for the financial institutions?<br>  <br>  <br>  we all do<br>  <br>  <br>  so then why in the name of common sense would anyone SADDLE Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae with those loans?<br>  <br>  ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY TOLD THE COUNTRY HOW THEY WARNED CONGRESS OF IMPENDING DISASTER<br>  <br>  thats what your boy BUSH did !!!<br>  <br>  Wasn't Bush brilliant in creating government financing plans so people did not need downpayments on their home?<br>  in the middle of a housing bubble?<br>  <br>  More Americans than ever own their own homes, but we must continue to work hard so that every family has an opportunity to realize the American Dream. In 2002, I announced a goal to add 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade. Since then, we have added 2.3 million new minority households. My Administration has also set a goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing tax credit and two mortgage programs -- the Zero Downpayment mortgage and the Payment Incentives program -- to help more families achieve homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities and improving citizens' lives. <br>  <br>  NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W.

But for the sake of your husband and for the sake of any children that you may have, make an effort to treat them with politely and with dignity.  Perhaps they dislike you, too. You don't have to act out your dislike for them, and if you behave well, you will be a good role model for your children.  Otherwise what will result is the kind of strife and heartbreak that exists in too many families.

I6dcRgD6aa	It takes time. You don't plant a garden & expect to have food the next day....OK, right now the people who own the hotdog wagon that used to sit in front of the construction site are out of work. So with Obama in office in a few months contruction will begin & the man with the carts will put his whole family back to work with them each having a hotdog cart. He has 4 kids from age 18 to age 25 & they are all 4 in the business & some are students. So the family is now with no income. So let's say in May they get there carts out & business is booming. They change their whole life. Instead of doing all the work around the house they call back the house cleaning servive & the lawn care company. They go to the food warehouse to stock up of a load of food every morning. They don't have time to upkeep their care so they pay to have it tuned up & washed & the women go back to having their nails done. They go out to dinner on Friday night & to a movie. They go to the mall on Saturday to buy a gift for a party they go to which they wouldn't even go to when they had no money. So they buy a new outfit. All of this is circulating our economy. When blood is stagnant a person starts getting sick. Money is our economy like blood is to the body it is our life force. So you may not notice that person who is walking down the street is different but they are. That same person might be depressed when our economy is depressed. Debt can add weight to a person. It is all like a metaphor. The metaphor changes. It would be visable if you have a really large lense but no it is not visable if you just look at them for a minute & never see them again....People mostly republicans fear that they will lose their jobs if their boss has his taxes raised but this is BS. There boss most likely can afford it or his taxes wouldn't be that high anyway. So those over $250,000 a year usually have a nice house, nice cars & kids in private school. So they complain & scare their employees but so what let them go out of business someone else will take their customers & be happy making $150,00 a year doing the same work. Republcans let people con them so easily they don't look at the whole picture. A person can still have a nice life on even $200,000 a year. If these people making over $250,000 would go out of business we would pay less for things. I worked for a man who made over $300,000 a year, years ago. He sold auto & home insurance. Anyone making $50,000 a year could do his job & if that money was sent back to the consumer we wouldn't pay so much.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	A lot.

It sounds like the means test treshhold is to low. This is because a lot of programmes have been cut back over the years.

People who have actually accumulated wealth are not deterred by the amounts of money that it takes to provide a college education for their children.  Some middle class people will always struggle but there are federal loans for college education and there are various scholarships and other means of help.  If your daughter can get into Harvard, for instance, and you earn less than $180,000 a year, the university will help pay for her education.

I'm all for scholarships for kids from poor neighborhoods and programs to help them transition to college. What I don't understand is the huge cost of tuition at state schools and the inability of middle class kids to use FAFSA (the government student loans/grants) because of their parent's income.  I wasn't able to get on FAFSA until I was married. Most people don't want to get married when they're 20, so what are they going to do? One of my friends received no support from his parents (his dad ran his own business and they couldn't afford it).  He had to get high-rate, private loans. He got no grants of any kind.

If someone asks for one or you want one, just say so & ask the attorneys to step over to the side AWAY from the jury. <br>  <br>  Sustaining or overruling objections depends on the rules of evidence.  When someone objects they must be given time to state -- in one sentence -- the grounds for the objection.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	It all boils down to this - parents care more about what other people (even strangers) think about them, than the FUTURE of their children.  Little 2-4 year olds who act bratty and get their way all the time usually end up in juvenile.  Or, at the very least, they end up being a burden to society because they just "don't feel like" working or they go from job to job because they're "treated bad" or whatever.  Basically, they're used to getting their own way all the time and "real life" is too much of a shock to them. <br>  <br>  However, after saying all that, we're not 100% disicpline kind of people.  We believe that it needs to be in balance.  If you're 100% about disciplining and ruling with an "iron thumb," then you end up pushing your childen away and alienating them.  There needs to be a lot of interaction, togetherness, affection, etc.  However, "love" NEVER means letting the child have his/her own way, be defient, rebellious, etc.  <br>  <br>  I get aggravated because when my children are around 18 months and learning not to whine for things, they will occasionally cry in the store.  Inevitably, the cashier will ask if my child wants a sucker or sticker.  I say, "NO, but this one (child) here (being quiet) can have one.  I certainly don't want to reward this tantrum."  They usually look at me like I'm mean.  I mean, why am I "letting" my child cry and be so "upset."  Well, if I give them the sticker/sucker, then they just learn that being a brat brings rewards.  It enforces the bad behavior.  I want my children to know that being sweet earns rewards.  <br>  <br>  I just don't get embarrassed when my children scream or whine in the store.  After a few months of "training" they realize they're not going to get their way.  They're not going to get what they're crying for.  And, they're not going to get rewarded for their poor behavior.|`|55NKPb82aa	Parents don't spend the time to discipline their children and expect everyone else to discipline their children.

And if Jews own most of the media, then it follows that the masses' opinion will be in favor of Jewish interests, such as siding with Israel in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.|`|zLXmOXkBaa	I'm sure that's what your media keeps telling you, but most of us feel that it's their business, not ours. Many people also feel that it's wrong, or over dramatic what Israel is doing. We also HATE the role our government plays in supporting everything they do, and arming them with so much military power and money.<br>  <br>  The people that side with Israel are Jewish here, and where I live, there's not many.

And in this case because it involves Jews, everyone allows it because no one wanted the problem coming the their land, thats why the US and the UK and the UN aided this theft of land, because they didn't want the problem on their land.<br>  <br>  How is it ever justifiable for Israel to attack?  Firstly, forget that their opponants are Muslims (because as soon as Muslims are mentioned, the West automatically dubs them as the enemies) and consider what is involved here.<br>  <br>  Israel "legally" stole the land of a country because they had nowhere else left to go after the Nazi's and had some sort of "claim" to this land because it was "supposedly" theirs thousands of years ago.  So how is this justifiable at all?  How can the West legalize the theft of land of another country just from supernatural/religious tales from thousands of years ago?  Wouldn't you think that fighting for your land back after it was stolen is justifiable?<br>  <br>  Now lets get back to whose land it was?  MUSLIMS!  Oh so now it IS justifiable.  This world is ridiculous.  And I'm not saying that everyone shares this view, you might think differently, but the majority of the world and especially the people with power in this world believe that.<br>  <br>  Look at Bosnia for example, more than half of it now is "claimed" by Serbia and Croatia because Bosnians didn't deserve the land because they were Muslim and needed to be ethnically cleansed by the rape of 50 000 women and murder of 250 000 people in brutal ways. And what about now, after the war ended 14 years ago?  The West has not helped Bosnia get back their land which IS legally supposed to be theirs.  Why?  Because nobody wants Muslims to have any claim to power, and if that means taking away their homes and lives, so be it.  It's disgusting.<br>  <br>  And I repeat again, as soon as it comes to Muslims its like the theft of land is allowable.  And in this case because it involves Jews, everyone allows it because no one wanted the problem coming the their land, thats why the US and the UK and the UN aided this theft of land, because they didn't want the problem on their land.|`|eneLtkY1aa	Who are these so-called palestinians???<br>  Study history instead of listening to propaganda.
QqxrVVnlaa	You make a good case. I'm not sure if he was a socialist but he was certainly part of a revolutionary movement. The demands of the emerging Christian religion was very radical.<br>  <br>  Early Christianity was, above all, a social liberation movement. Ideas of gods were central to almost all philosophy's at that time so the  deification of Jesus can be understood in those terms.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, as Christianity grew in influence, the rich and powerful joined it and shaped it into what we see today. All religions must be all things to all people in order for it to have mass appeal. Ergo, the poor can point to the aspects that you have pointed out but also, the rich can justify their own actions, (war, imperialism, creating wealth and poverty, etcetera).<br>  <br>  Socialism needs to be clear that it's the politics of the working class and have absolutely nothing to do with the rich!|`|yv3unx5Eaa	Read Charles Sheldon's "In His Steps." Knowing you probably wont read it. Yes, kinda.|`|SSLekPAnaa	You just described the Republican party. Jesus would have definitely been a Republican.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	I wish to God people would leave Jesus out of our politics when trying to make their point.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	He sure was. I used to go fishing with him and he told me personally he is a socialist. And I was like Jesus Christ seriously? Yes he said. He even told me after he was done with the whole"saving humanity thingy" as he called it he would work hard to sent the world a socialist prophet called Karl Marx<br>  <br>  BTW amazing fisherman too|`|Ca8i226Xaa	No, and he did own something his clothes for instance. Jesus said, "Render unto Caesar, what is Caesar's," thus acknowdging that government has a role to play. The govt in Judea was not Socialist at the time, dude, so you are wrong.<br>  <br>  You are making up most of this stuff, dude, get a life!|`|6AgnCKCPaa	No.  He spoke to the individual not the government.

He never said it was the only choice.   <br>  2) Not so - Jesus actually had a family but it was hushed up by the Church.<br>  3) Yes he did - and Socialists don't.   Have you actually READ Marx?<br>  4) Usury is not the same thing as finance capitalism.    There is such a thing as the time value of money.   If you can't earn interest, you won't deposit your money in a lending institution, and nobody will be able to borrow it.   <br>  5) Again, by choice, not by decree.   By choice means on terms that every participant can agree with.    <br>  6) Right - that's his kingdom.  He also said give to Caesar.   He recognized that there were other kingdoms.   He was focused on his.<br>  7) "Turn the Other Cheek" actually meant to shun - today we'd say "look down your nose."   Look it up.<br>  8) And?<br>  9) Yes, and if he'd been a leftist he wouldn't have healed anyone for fear of taking a job from medical professionals.<br>  10) Imperialism isn't the free market.    Last I checked, it was the USSR that had an empire, not the USA.|`|GXxC8CIfaa	Nice try socialist, but no He was not.  He took personal responsibility for Himself and did not advocate "mooching" off the government (i.e. all the working,  tax paying citizens).<br>  <br>  Remember Jesus was the one who took 5 loaves of bread and 3 fishes and fed 5,000 people.  He was not the one without food begging for someone to provide for him (socialist).  He was the one providing for those without (the captialist).|`|AA11782843	Jesus,under today's definition of socialism, would be considered as one.

Aren't liberals too intelligent to believe in "Jesus"?|`|056808dd570d68083099a59a7b2fab22aa	First of all Jesus is God, therefore he is and was entirely unconcerned about material goods for himself.  That said, when a woman opened an expensive bottle of perfume and bathed his feet with it, people nearby decried her acts, claiming that the perfume should have been sold to benefit the poor.  Jesus said that the poor will always be with them but he would be on earth for a short while.  I take that to mean that those who have should be compassionate to the poor but poverty on earth will never be eradicated, and why should it be when we are all headed to death and an afterlife in which material possessions are meaningless?  He also said that we will be judged by how we treat those less fortunate (the sermon on the mount) and that it will be easier to drive a camel through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go to heaven.  His message was that wealth, whether the possession of it or the desire for it is an impediment to saving faith.  This is not a political message.|`|GPZUfFZ1aa	No.  Jesus was perfectly okay with women occupying a lower social status than men, and he also condoned slavery.<br>  <br>  Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful.  You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.  (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)<br>  <br>   The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  "But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given."  (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)<br>  <br>  I am fairly sure that the socialist ideal is very much in opposition to slavery.  So that's about it from me.  Jesus was just a dude who pissed off a bunch of already pissed-off Italians and got spiked for it - big deal.|`|VBEMxcopaa	1 Look at Henry David Thoreau owned nothing was he a socialist no more of a naturalist 2. Mathew 19 3-11 read it 3 Yes he did 4 where are you getting this from I can not find this in the scriptures he in fact said opposite of what you said  read luke 20 22-26 5 Yes he did 6 he never mentions a nation state please give references 7 no he said fight for the justice for faith not for political justice, he would have caused problems in the system which he taught peace not justice which is against the standards of socialism 8 Yes he was 9 yes he did 10 yes he said you can not serve 2 masters but read luke 20 again what is the lords is the lords and what is caesars is caesars.<br>  <br>  Lets look at the word socialism<br>  a theory or system of social organization that advocates the vesting of the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc., in the community as a whole. <br>  <br>  He never you have give to the poor he said if you can and want to read luke 18 10-14 the man that gave for glory was more rejected by the lord than the person who knew he was a sinner and tried be better<br>  <br>  please read your scriptures before you begin to preach.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	Jesus never advised anyone to steal money that is not theirs.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	No.<br>  <br>  Jesus never advocated taking people's wealth under force of law and giving it to others.<br>  <br>  He advocated giving to the poor, which many conservatives do.<br>  <br>  Comparing Jesus's views to socialism is like comparing Dr. Ruth, who advocates healthy sexual relations, to a rapist.  Again, the concept of voluntary action is the difference.

c40692e8f41f1f9fcd1571bce1ccb576aa	We should not discuss every issue in context of Muslims. The population of Muslims worldwide is above 1500 Millions, whereas around 20 Million Muslims are in India. The rules of Islam are not made for Indian Muslims only. Islam never says to grow your population in an unplanned way. You may have children as much as you want, if you are able to give them all proper and equal opportunity to develop, means proper education, proper food and proper life style. ALLAH has given you brain to think and analyze the things properly. But unfortunately their approach is not positive even after having brain. If you come in contact of well educated Muslim families, you will find one to three children in general in their families but at the same time you will see more children in Non Muslims un-educated families too, in the villages. I don’t consider Muslim Leaders (MULLAS) competent enough to educate them. I am not going to attend Muslim religious functions regularly but whenever I attend, I never found them discussing or teaching them the importance of education but found them only discussing about the history of Islam and differences among Muslims sects. The first message of Allah to the Prophet (PBUH) was “Read in the name of Allah who created you”, are Muslims following it?. Who would teach them to live, like the way Islam suggested? No doubt, the percentage of educated people in Indian Muslims is increasing but even it is much lover than the required. Education doesn’t mean only knowledge of English, Hindi or Science but overall development of brain must be there otherwise population of Taleybaan type Muslims would be increasing to destroy School buildings like Sawaat in Pakistan. Finally, I would like to request all, not to blame any particular community in general. Rather than being, offensive, we should try to find a solution of the problem politely.|`|7plX37M9aa	Yes I agree with MMJF.But how many muslims like you think.Why oppose uniform civil code.The Congress Govt.and all our so called Secular parties are just exploiting Muslims for their Vote Bank.|`|xOVYHbuiaa	i completely agree with mirza 's answer and we should not blame only Muslims for population growth.<br>  we are equally responsible because to get a boy child many parents were going up to 10 childrens from single couple. and yes this is a social issue as compared to political issue.<br>  But congress with its 40 years rule has unable to solve this problem we are still increasing at rapid rate. so yes it is a total failure of government to stop this growth and it must had created some laws like two child policy for single couple etc.but alas they could not rise above politics.|`|USz2DSSUaa	because  there is a sinister design of the congress to islamise india. and only  the muslim votebank votes for it.and the more islamised we become the more uncivilised we will become.

6AgnCKCPaa	A Republican is a member of a political party.  Conservative, for the most part, refers to an ideology (there is a Conservative Party as well).  A conservative can be a member of any political party just like a liberal can..|`|otYOxmnuaa	Republicans are liberals cloaked in conservatism.<br>  <br>  Conservatives are the ones pissed at Republicans.  They believe in minimizing the use of resources and maximizing the benefit/gain for fiscal and social problems in society.|`|9dEotvVwaa	Used to be one and the same. Now they are a mile apart.|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	I'm a conservative but I'm not a Republican.<br> <br> Conservative is a quiet and unassuming way of life. Conservatives generally do not seek to draw a lot of attention to themselves with flashy clothes or shiny jewelry. They don't worry about trying to keep up with the Jones'. They believe in living modestly and below their means. Conservatives are forward thinking. They look to the future, they plan, they save, they try to anticipate future needs and adjust accordingly. Conservatives are self-supporting and independent. They tend to form a few very strong close relationships rather than a great number of superficial relationships.<br> <br> Republican is a political position. It literally means " anti-monarchy/anti-aristocracy". They believe in small government with few regulations. It's like a moderate form of anarchist.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Republican = political party<br>  Conservative = political philosophy<br>  <br>  Not all Republicans are conservative and not all conservatives are Republicans.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	Conservatives practice what they preach about fiscal conservation.

True conservatives are extinct.|`|J3tv9OeVaa	A conservative believes in smaller government.<br>  <br>  A republican says they believe in small government but then advocates laws that restrict individual freedoms and grow the bureaucracy. <br>  <br>  Republicans represent the interests of the elite, but pretend to reach out to the working class. The only do that during an election cycle though, then Joe the Plumber goes his own way for the next four years and his interests are abandoned by the GOP.<br>  <br>  Republicans are neo-liberals; not even close to conservative, especially recently.|`|vKR4tysjaa	Repukes are generally the spineless bastards that run for office and get mainstream media approval, because the socialist loving main stream media won't mind if they actually win.  See McLame or bushie, both liberals when it comes to government policies & spending money.<br>  <br>  Conservatives think people should be responsible for their own damned actions.  Little example:  Why would the government take YOUR tax money to buy condoms for some planned parenthood abortion promoting, condom distributing office in freaking JAPAN?- it's in the current bailout package, read it!  Why can't they buy their own damned condoms? <br>  <br>  Governments place should be in DC, not in our houses.

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	The President, and all politicians for that matter, need to be frank and realistic about the economy. It's fine to be optimistic when talking about any indicators that might be positive (or less bad than expected), but it's dangerous to give false optimism. <br>  <br>  I realize that the biggest factor in any economic recovery is consumer confidence. But trying to build confidence by painting an unfounded rosy picture is dangerous. For example, it would be horrible to say things are looking up when a jobs report just came out saying 700,000 jobs were lost in February. That's something like 1.5-2 million lost just in the first 2 months of 2009.|`|AA12341057	The way you describe a half glass of water matters.

Nothing he did or said was ever any good. No Democrat offered any by-partisan help. Now, when the shoe is on the other foot the cries of outrage from the left are deafening. I agree, name calling is not helpful, but for a little while at least, it sure feels good.|`|AA11209233	A lot of people, in your party and mine (I guess I'll claim the dems--I did vote that way this time), are pretty simple.  They cheer for their guys, and can regurgitate a point.  They bash anything and don't listen to what the other side says--I've even seen people ask questions that one of the presidents answered the day before if anyone listened.   You are right--it does little to help the country.  On the other hand it doesn't hurt as much as you may think.<br>  <br>  Let's take the Bush bashing.  Sure, democrats don't like many republican policies, but look at the ones they really slammed him for other than going into Iraq--torture, no-bid military contracts, tax cuts for companies making record profits because their prices were at all time highs.  And then look at the next election.  Sure, we still differed on which war was most important, which tax cuts and spending are important, and a few other things, but we were able to unite as a country on some issues, such as to stop torture.   We seem to be getting closer on the health care issue (the democrats are getting less crazy about government provided care, while the republicans are opening up to making insurance more readily available).  Congress spends over $800 billion and there is only $20 billion disputed by the opposition as wasteful.  When you get past the people yelling for their side and get to the congressmen and people actually working on this, you'll see the country isn't as divided as it may appear.<br>  <br>  We can argue about grants to Acorn and Halliburton for a while, and it seems to do nothing.  But usually, things do change--just not as quickly or perfectly as we would like.  It is important that the republicans tell Obama and company any time he is screwing up.  But if they keep whining about things they know they lost when they lost the election, then no one will be listening when what they have to say really matters.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	We need to cull out the bad dogs, who in this case are the Obama acolytes.|`|SLfmBjkOaa	Finally, a smart Republican.

Even a tiny urban park can hold a "heart walk" trail where people of all fitness levels can exercise safely with no membership fee. I would also support subsidies for neighborhood recreation centers which include facilities for physical fitness. Encouraging backyard and community gardens would also promote better diet and physical activity. <br>  <br>  Another consideration is the difficulty of maintaining a good diet in many low income neighborhoods. There are 7 fast food restaurants within one mile of my urban home, but it is nearly 4 miles (40 minutes each way by bus, due to transfer) to the nearest place to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. Please don't point out that the liquor store sells limes for $1 each and the mini-mart sells apples and bananas for $1.29 each. You know very well that a healthy diet needs more variety and more affordable prices.<br>  <br>  Several studies have found that people who live in areas with a good mass transit system have less obesity and less heart disease. I believe that the mile or two a day walking to and from the train station is the prime factor here. So I am all in favor of passive incentives that make it easier to do healthy things, less attractive to do unhealthy things.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Yes, let's let fat people die in the streets of curable aliments if they can't afford the copay, and how about those smokers, and people who are skinny but eat too much fat and cholesterol, and people who drink, and people who have promiscuous sex, etc, etc, etc. Only healthy people should get health care.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	Under socialized medicine, you won't have a choice as to whether you support fat people. I mean, I'm sure the government would do everything to encourage people to lose the weight, but they're not going to force them. <br>  <br>  As it stands, you still pay for fat people. The insurance companies don't increase the rates on people unless their condition has a direct effect on their health. Their weight itself isn't a factor.<br>  <br>  EDT: I'm just asking what you would have people do? Some people do have a metabolism problem. Should they just drop over and die?

6twdFmFAaa	First of all I believe marijuana should be Federally legal to every state that votes for its use. California barely has control of pot crops without the Feds trying bust in and steal the herb. Pot is harmless, its just the people who can't handle their smoke and cause problems (like drunks) for every one else, people who really make a mess of things are the gangs that are involved with pot and old hypocrites who don't want pot to legal even though they you'st to smoke. But if people could be fair to the stoners pot could be used recreationally like alchohol, but safer.|`|mSrnLnNcaa	I'm torn. If California wanted to legalize it, they should have done it a long time ago. But as far as taxing it. There are huge issues with that. Like, why wouldn't you just grow pot instead of paying for it. How would the cops know the difference between "store bought" weed and "home grown" weed. It's a pointless piece of legislation because quite frankly, I don't care. I don't smoke pot so it doesn't matter if it gets passed or not passed.|`|YseOZhI5aa	IT SHOULD STAY LEGAL AND IF CALIFORNIA TOOK MORE CONTROL OF IT OR THE THE GOVERNMENT, THEY WOULDNT BE IN SUCH A HOLE. ITS A MULTI MILLION TO BILLION $ INDUSTRY.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Only for Medical use of course.|`|TZz1uPY2aa	They should. It would be one heck of a tax source for a tanked California economy.|`|zKjgWdqAaa	Making it illegal doesn't seem to stop anyone.  And it keeps the price high, which makes it attractive to criminals.  If it were made legal, the price would come down, criminals would lose interest, the government could tax it for revenue, and we wouldn't watse money locking millions of people up for smoking.  Sounds good to me.

Myers completing repairs 74 days early on the earthquake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway: "There was one key element that made this happen. One key thing: The governor of California declared the [freeway] a disaster area and by so doing eliminated the need for competitive bids.... Government got the hell out of the way." (TV show, 4/13/94) "They gave this guy [Myers] the job without having to go through the rigmarole...of giving 25 percent of the job to a minority-owned business and 25 percent to a woman." (TV show, 4/15/94) <br>  <br>  REALITY: There was competitive bidding: Myers beat four other contractors for the job. Affirmative action rules applied: At least 40 percent of the subcontracts went to minority or women-owned firms. Far from getting out of the way, dozens of state employees were on the job 24 hours a day. Furthermore, the federal government picked up the tab for the whole job (L.A. Times, 5/1/94). <br>  <br>  LIMBAUGH: "Banks take the risks in issuing student loans and they are entitled to the profits." (Radio show, quoted in FRQ, Summer/93) <br>  <br>  REALITY: Banks take no risks in issuing student loans, which are federally insured. <br>  <br>  LIMBAUGH: "Don't let the liberals deceive you into believing that a decade of sustained growth without inflation in America [in the '80s] resulted in a bigger gap between the haves and the have-nots. Figures compiled by the Congressional Budget Office dispel that myth." (Ought to Be, p. 70) <br>  <br>  REALITY: CBO figures do nothing of the sort. Its numbers for after-tax incomes show that in 1980, the richest fifth of our country had eight times the income of the poorest fifth. By 1989, the ratio was more than 20 to one. <br>  <br>  LIMBAUGH: Comparing the 1950s with the present: "And I might point out that poverty and economic disparities between the lower and upper classes were greater during the former period." (Told You So, p. 84) <br>  <br>  REALITY: Income inequality, as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau, fell from the 1940s to the late 1960s, and then began rising. Inequality surpassed the 1950 level in 1982 and rose steadily to all-time highs in 1992. (Census Bureau's "Money Income of Households, Families and Persons in the United States") <br>  <br>  LIMBAUGH: "Oh, how they relished blaming Reagan administration policies, including the mythical reductions in HUD's budget for public housing, for creating all of the homeless! Budget cuts? There were no budget cuts! The budget figures show that actual construction of public housing increased during the Reagan years." (Ought to Be, p. 242-243) <br>  <br>  REALITY: In 1980, 20,900 low-income public housing units were under construction; in 1988, 9,700, a decline of 54 percent ;Statistical Abstracts of the U.S).In terms of 1993 dollars, the HUD budget for the construction of new public housing was slashed from $6.3 billion in 1980 to $683 million in 1988. "We're getting out of the housing business. Period," a Reagan HUD official declared in 1985. <br>  <br>  LIMBAUGH: "The poorest people in America are better off than the mainstream families of Europe." (Radio show, quoted in FRQ, Spring/93) <br>  <br>  REALITY: Huh? The average cash income of the poorest 20 percent of Americans is $5,226; the average cash income of four major European nations--Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy--is $19,708. <br>  <br>  LIMBAUGH: "There's no such thing as an implied contract." (Radio show, quoted in FRQ, Spring/93) <br>  <br>  REALITY: Every first-year law student knows there is. <br>  <br>  LIMBAUGH: "Ladies and gentlemen, we now know why there is this institutional opposition to low tax rates in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. It's because [low tax rates] are biblical in nature and in root. When you can trace the lowering of tax rates on grain from 90 percent to 20 percent giving seven fat years during the days of Pharaoh in Egypt, why then you are tracing the roots of lower taxes and rising prosperity to religion.... You can trace individual prosperity, economic growth back to the Bible, the Old Testament. Isn't it amazing?" (Radio show, 6/28/93) <br>  <br>  REALITY: Amazingly wrong. Genesis 41 is about the wisdom of instituting taxes, not cutting them. After Pharaoh had a dream that prophesied seven fat years to be followed by seven lean years, Joseph advised him to "appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years...and lay up corn under the hands of Pharaoh." In other words, a 20 percent tax on the grain harvest would put aside food for use during the famine. Pharaoh took Joseph's advice, and Egypt avoided hunger during the famine<br>  <br>  Weird Science<br>  <br>  LIMBAUGH: "It has not been proven that nicotine is addictive, the same with cigarettes causing emphysema [and other diseases]."

fAaLjlI0aa	Depends on several things. The details of the incident, first and foremost. I am rather surprised it would be a simple battery charge, since it was assault with a deadly weapon. <br>  <br>  What will happen: He will go to court. He will plead (if he has any brains at all) not guilty. The judge will ask if he has retained counsel, and if he answers no, the judge will then ask if he can afford an attorney or if he would like one appointed for him. If he cannot afford the attorney, a public defender will be appointed to the case. Then it will get held over so he has time in which to confer with the attorney and the attorney has time to review the case. They will go back into court. The PD will talk to the DA. The DA will offer a plea bargain. The PD will tell him the plea bargain details and ask him what he wants to do. He will take or refuse the plea bargain. If he takes the plea bargain, he will tell the judge as much, and then the judge will read off a list of rights he will have to waive if he accepts the plea. He will have to answer yes to each, and then the judge will ask if both the attorney and the DA concur, and they will say yes, and the guilty plea will be entered. Then he will get a date for sentencing. At sentencing, what kind of sentence he gets will depend on several factors: does he have a record? what were the circumstances of the assault? what kind of knife was it? does he have family to support him? what was his history with the victim? what kind of mood is the judge in? how good is his attorney? what was the probationary report? what does the DA say about it?  All of these things will have an impact, large or small, on the sentence the judge finally goes with. If it is a first offense, and the person was not seriously injured, and he has good familial support, and he shows remorse, then he may get a light sentence in juvie followed by probation. He may even get probation coupled with restitution and community service if he's lucky and all the stars are aligned. <br>  <br>  If he does not take the plea, he will go to trial. Then his fate is going to be in the hands of 12 people who don't know him, and it will all come down to who is more convincing: the public defender or the DA. It's usually the DA.|`|jX7Bt0iBaa	He'll get tased and proabably thrown into prison. They don't care that he's young. Here in America all criminals are the same. :)  He'll probably get thrown in jail with a murder or a child rapist.  <br>  <br>  It REALLY depends on what judge you get.

At this point, I think an MA isn't going to be the thing that stops them from hiring you.  What would be really great is if you had a foreign language skill, Chinese or Farsi/Arabic are hot right now. They are really desperate for those language skills right now.  See if you can take some classes then add "basic chinese" to your resume.

eYcNsptOaa	The 22nd amendment is not in the Bill of Rights, only the first 10 Amendments are considered to be the Bill of Rights, however, if you want to learn about it, go here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seco...</a>|`|AA10691319	first the 22nd amendment isnt in the bill of rights, thats only the first 10.  Second the bill was passed in 1951, because of FDR's 4 terms (16 year presidancy).  it limits the presadancy to 10 years total for any person.  George washington layed down the format for thhis by stepping down after only 2 terms, and everyone fallowed suit untill FDR.  It was made with the entent of preventing a president to become as a monarch in the USA by declaring himself president for life or something like that.|`|wnWIxb9maa	Since the presidency of George Washington, only one thing could be said to be totally consistent - that no President had the job for more than two full terms. Washington had been asked to run for a third term in 1796, but he made it quite clear that he had no intention of doing so; that an orderly transition of power was needed to set the Constitution in stone. And so it was for almost 150 years.<br>  <br>  Franklin Delano Roosevelt was first elected President in 1932, and re-elected in 1936. When it came time for the Democrats to nominate a candidate for the Presidency in 1940, two things had happened. First, the Republicans had made great gains in Congress in the 1938 elections. And Hitler happened. Europe was in the throes of a great war, with trouble in the Pacific, too. A change away from Roosevelt, who had led the nation through the Great Depression, did not seem wise. He was nominated for an unprecedented third term, and won. It was not a landslide victory, however, and it is debatable that FDR would have had a third term had it not been for the war. When 1944 rolled around, changing leaders in the middle of World War II, which the United States was now fully engaged in, also seemed unwise, and FDR ran for and was elected to, a fourth term.<br>  <br>  His life was nearly over, however, and his Vice President, Harry Truman, became President upon FDR's death less than 100 days after his inauguration. Though FDR's leadership was seen by many as a key reason that the U.S. came out of WWII victorious, the Congress was determined, once the war ended, to ensure that Washington's self-imposed two-term limit become the law of the land. Specifically excepting Truman from its provisions, the 22nd Amendment passed Congress on March 21, 1947. After Truman won a second term in 1948, it was ratified on February 27, 1951 (1,439 days). Truman could have run for a third term, but bowed out early before campaigning began.
eYcNsptOaa	Involvement in what, Iraq yes, minding their own business no.|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	Hmm. vague question. but, if you are talking about military involvement, then yes it can have negative effects. we do need military sometimes to 'kick bums'. but we could wage a different war. we could help fund schools for girls, keep the people fed and healthy, and show them their chosen government does nothing for them. and maybe, after time, the people will have a change of heart and change their own government.

6DGmbILkaa	So, they are offering to pay your medical bills only, right?  If you actually did have pain and suffering, at minimum tell them that their offer is unacceptable, that you plan to file suit, and see if they counter with something higher.<br>  <br>  It would be best to have an attorney, but I understand wanting to represent yourself.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, if you sign a settlement agreement, your right to sue is gone forever!  Also, most states have a 1-2 year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, so don't drag your feet.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	It depends entirely on your injuries. In order to prevail with pain and suffering you have to actually have some, generally stuff that hasn't gone away in a few days.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	You should not get anything for pain and suffering.  They are paying your medical bills which is great!  Did you miss any time off work? If so maybe they will add that in to the settlement as well.  When people take advantage of issues like this it's bad in the long run as this is what often causes prices to go up.  You are certainly entitled to the actual costs of bills, though.|`|AA10123414	"because they are admitting they was at fault for the injuries that happen" - HIGHLY unlikely. They made an offer and I expect that if you read the offer they specifically state that they do NOT accept responsibility.<br>  <br>  If I slipped while walking on ice I would not try to blame some else if I fell. it is ice, I know it is slick. If I don't feel comfortable walking on ice, I don't.<br>  <br>  I would accept the offer. You can hire a lawyer, however it comes out of what ever you win.
oFiGyMWraa	Its not clear what you mean by "purchased in trust". I am assuming that the 4 children bought and own the house which the grandmother lived in during her life. This could either have been by her having a formal life interest under a trust, by a commercial arrangement where she paid rent, or for free by the goodwill of her children. It makes little difference to the answer.<br>  <br>  I am sure that in this arrangement the children were owning as beneficial tenants in common. In which case the share of the child who died would have been part of his estate. It would have passed according to his will, which was apparently to his wife. If for some strange reason they were owning as beneficial joint tenants then the dead child's share would automatically belong to the survivors when he died. The wife would be entitled to nothing. Either way this would all have been sorted out by his executors when he died, so it is unclear why the wife is only "claiming" her share now.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, maybe something far more complicated happened when the house was bought and/or when the child died and/or when the grandmother died. You really need to take all the documents to a solicitor and ask him whats going on.|`|AA11206283	Depends if the inheritance was done per stirpes or per capita.<br>  <br>  ASk a probate lawyer|`|6e801dc2d4cb4e651c8b24905ccb9bacaa	It depends upon the trust language, which no one here has read & which, therefore, no one here can answer.|`|CowgOqXTaa	When the son died his estate passed to his wife. If his estate included a 1/4 share in the trust then that, too, passed to her. <br>  <br>  If he was not a part owner of the trust, but merely a beneficiary, then his benefit would usually pass per stirpes, which means that it did not pass to his wife when he died, but passes "through him" to his children.<br>  <br>  For an accurate answer, a lawyer will need to review the trust papers.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|xjcZkmpbaa	I don't think anyone can accurately answer that question based on just the facts you've stated.  It will depend on the terms of the trust instrument, the various wills involved, how the property was deeded and the laws of your particular jurisdiction.  I would see an attorney.

Wait until the recession is over in other countries before you go.<br>  <br>  I would easily get into into Oz or NZ due to my qualifications but have no money to take along. Anyways, I'll rank the destinations like this NZ, Oz, Canada, Switzerland, Netherland, British Islands (England, Scotland, Wales or Ireland choose one). It actually depends on whether you can live in cold weather or not.<br>  <br>  I ranked NZ above Oz because Oz is becoming a desert (drought) and has too many wild fires burning everything down. They're biggest problem is water at the moment.<br>  <br>  Problem with EU countries are that they are too dependent on each other and it really is cold. If one country sneezes, all the other countries catches the cold. Thus, if one country decides to cut the gas supply, the other countries die of the cold or can't eat.<br>  <br>  Which is why Canada is better.|`|ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	Forget about trying to immigrate to Canada.

You can come up with all types of ways it can save money in the court system and help economy but that argument doesn't stand.  People who are complaining about being broke with the economy going down, are the same people who are spending tons of their money getting high; but they can't pay their bills.  So how is buying pot helping the economy? Since we are so worried about saving money to help economy.  Who's gonna stop people from self destructing?  What happens when pot is not strong enough anymore?  Then what ,CRACK?  Why do people need drugs to function?  Do you not like your life that much.? Its just a question.  There are some almost compelling arguments that people can come up with to legalize pot, but they dont debate that hard for anything else in their lives.  It's something about being clean and drug free that I like.  It lets me know I'm in full control over my life, not under anybody's influence.  Unfortunately, I live in a state who has legalized it for medical use.  That argument  seems to have won.  I just think drugs are pacifiers for life's problems.  The only people I know who need pacifiers are babies.  You guys are not babies so you dont need drugs.  Just try being drug free its more fulfilling than being high.  Hope I didn't offend anyone.  I didn't intend to just wanted to someone to realize that they are better without it.|`|TSsmnZdkaa	Like after the ending of prohibition, it will end the reigns of the drug cartels who are nearly turning Mexico into a failed state.|`|AA11908435	Too much money is wasted busting people for pot.

If they need the complainant then they may ask for a continuance. this is also a good time to discuss a deal with the ADA who will honestly not want to bring the case back up if its a minor offense.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	It depends on the court.  In mississippi justice court (aka Small claims court) the court will send a notice of court date when the documents have been filed and if the plaintiff does not show up then the case will be dismissed and the plaintiff can not refile. But if the defendant doesn't show up then usually a default judgment will be entered in favor of the plaintiff. As far as the other courts such as county/chancery/circuit courts usually the plaintiff will call the court and arrange a court date and the plaintiff will be responsible for filing a notice of hearing/trial.  If for any reason the plaintiff cannot attend then a motion to continue should be filed within 5 business days of court (or what ever the time period that court requires).  If for any reason you do not show then you would have to call the court and explain to them why you didn't show and the judge will make a decision (usually just continues it to another date.)<br>  <br>  You should purchase your states rules of procedure for the state court system.

A defendant is either guilty or not guilty - if he was charged, it was likely because he assisted others in shoplifting, even if he did not take the goods himself.  If he was aquitted, deferred, or given a discharge, he does not have a criminal record.<br>  <br>  Having said that, he should be able to get a pardon or expungement without too much effort.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	why do you need to take care of it,,,, shouldn't he take care of it.|`|0d8DPXJ3aa	My wife and I are licensed foster parents, and I know the process to get licensed in the state of Texas is pretty thorough.  For us to get licensed we had to complete several tasks and meet certain requirements.  Some of the requirements were to have a criminal background check, attend training, have a health inspection and fire inspection completed on our home, and have a licensed social worker complete a home study.  There are also yearly CEU type requirements.<br>  <br>  I'm not telling you this to discourage you, but I don't want you to think the process is simple. You should check with your local family protective service to see what is required in your state.  In Texas, the Department of Family Protective Service (DFPS) contracts with child placement agencies (CPA), and they are responsible for the foster homes under their supervision.  When we decided to become foster parents we contacted a local CPA and got the information from them.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, you should contact the appropriate governing body in your state to see what is required.

Iraq was terrible for our economy.|`|c3vPZfghaa	umm that would be supply-side economics, because the companies building them would be making billions.<br>  Its kind of like the same thing going on with the nukes that are constantly being built and disassembled every few decades just so more can be built.<br>  <br>  Now if you did what you suggested, while doubling the wages of the employees, and doubling the size of the work force, that would be Keynesian economics.<br>  <br>  i don't think war is good for the economy unless it results in protectionist environment for American businesses and higher wages for laborers like WWII did. That would be critics of FDR who believe that, claiming it was WWII that got us out of the depression.<br>  <br>  War these days actually result in accumulation of wealth in the hand of companies that build the weapons, and the security corporations, which has little affect on the rest of the economy.<br>  <br>  Guy you sound highly confused while attempting to understand what Keynesian economics is.<br>  keynesians belive that jobs are ultimately created by demand.<br>  Without purchasing of products businesses have no reason to increase labor force.<br>  You put the money into the hands of people who will spend it, and demand will grow creating greater need for labor, resulting in job creation.<br>  <br>  Our current problem is the result of jobs moving overseas. People see their friends and loved ones losing their jobs to outsourcing, so they stop spending resulting in reduced consumer confidence which is one of the measures of economic conditions that investors use when determining how to invest.<br>  <br>  keynesians economics in a nutshell is the idea that wealth flows up from the consumers rather than down from the rich, as in trickle -down and your example.<br>  <br>  keynesian = wealth created by wealth accumulation from consumer<br>  supply side = wealth created by dispersion to laborers<br>  each of which are only part of  the whole healthy functioning economy.<br>  <br>  SUPPLY DOES NOT CREATE DEMAND<br>  Supply creates value depending on demand.<br>  I don't know where you get the idea that supply creates demand.<br>  If supply created demand, demand of oil would be going up rather than down as surplus is generated.<br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090303/ap_on_bi_ge/awash_in_oil">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090303/ap_o...</a><br>  <br>  many businesses have gone bankrupt thinking supply creates demand. It is ideas like that, that motivates over-production that leads to surplus which causes falling prices and lower profit margins.<br>  <br>  And no demand doesn't create supply. You can't simply want something and it is there. Just like you can't just make something and expect someone to want it.<br>  Demand creates the value of the supply and the desire to increase supply to fill that demand, which leads to greater labor demands.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	that solution was brought up by one of the lobbyists and it was pointed out that we don't have enough ships to evacuate but half the people.

SIKuOevVaa	No, it's not totally fair.  There are plenty of conservatives who tell the truth.  Unfortunately, this gets them in roughly as much trouble as the lies told by other conservatives.<br>  <br>  But there is a line from John Stuart Mill: "Not all conservatives are stupid people, but most stupid people are conserative."|`|70DZWz2Baa	are liberals fair at all?|`|cWyQc7T7aa	False.|`|cMHxg372aa	Pretty much. I'd also add that most of the lies they tell are to themselves. Since most are born-agains, this is second nature to them. And yes, ALL theists lie to themselves on a regular basis, it is a necessity. There is no way any sane person could really, truly accept ridiculous myths like that of a 6,000 year-old universe, virgin births, and guy who lived inside whales. No way, no how. <br>  <br>  Instead, when they get a nagging "doubt" (e.g., the subconscious mechanism which doesn't allow the mind to wander too far from reality), they quickly devise a way to rationalize it away. See, to them, their theological/ideological preconceptions are the only real truth; the truth of all other propositions is measured by the extent to which it reinforces their internalized beliefs. It's the height of self-deception, really.<br>  <br>  As political ideology and religion are one and the same to the reich-wingers, this self-deception naturally carries over into political realm. It is sooo incredibly obvious too - they might be able to fool themselves, but they ain't fooling me.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	I would say this:  "I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid.

I would not have trusted them not to do exactly what they've done in every other industry--play favorites with corrupt businesses, cut reguation and oversight, and say "to he**" with the consequences. Katrina is a god example of what I mean.<br>  <br>  Properly engineered, implemented, andoperated, nuclear power using modern technology is safe--and also cost-effective. It's a valuable source of energy and we need to make use of it.<br>  <br>  An interesting point. Here in Georgia (and this same story iis playing out in South Carolina next dor) we have an initiative to begin construction of new nuclear power plants. There is opposition from only one quarter--the conservative Republicans. Two points. One--their excuse is they don't want to "spend the money" (invest) in bonds to help finance the project (those bonds would be "private purpose"--paid for by operating revenues, not the taxpayers. All the state of Georgia woudl do is guarantee the bonds). Second point--almost all (maybe all) are taking fat "campaign contributions" from the coal companies.|`|spPD3Mrzaa	A good question. We all know that nuclear energy is, if nothing else, very capital intensive. It costs a bloody fortune, and most capitalists don't want to bet that large an ante on future income. Having the government do it is a problem with most folks, though, although perhaps the Navy could do it responsibly.|`|y0MnsQRNaa	YES! Nuclear power, I believe is the best, safest, most reliable, current technology to provide energy. The plants operating now are safe and the new designs are even safer.<br>  Building 100's of new nuclear power plants would improve the economy, reduce or eliminate dependence on foreign oil, create jobs, reduce pollution, and provide for future technological advancement. <br>  I have been working with nuclear power for about 30 years, I would be glad to have a Nuclear power plant or high level waste disposal facility in my backyard. My family and I live in a home within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant. (where I work) I have a great understanding of the risks involved and am completely comfortable with a plant "in my backyard". I have confidence that my grandchildren’s grandchildren will be smart enough to treat the nuclear "waste" as a valuable resource or at least smart enough to handle it safely . If the cavemen thought their children would be too stupid to use fire safely, where would we be now? <br>  Using Chernobyl as a reason not to build is like saying because of the Hindenburg I will never fly in a commercial airliner.<br>  Nuclear power has the smallest environmental impact of any current energy production method per unit of energy produced. One fuel pellet about the size of a pencil eraser produces the same energy as about 1 ton of coal, and if reprocessed 2/3 of whats left can be reclaimed. Nuclear power is our best option for reliable, environmentally friendly base-load electrical power.<br>  PROS<br>  !. Fission is the most energy for the least fuel with current technology.<br>  2. Less fuel means less waste, and the waste is all accounted for, not released into the atmosphere to become someone else's problem.<br>  3. Uranium is readily available, very common in the earth's crust (about the same as tin)<br>  4. Economical - operating cost about the same as coal, fuel cost is a much smaller percentage of the total, therefore less susceptible to price fluctuations.<br>  5. Reliable - Nuclear power plants have very high capacity factors.<br>  6. No combustion, no Co, CO2 or SO2 released.<br>  7. Creates jobs.<br>  8. Reduce dependence on foreign oil/ fuel. Uranium available domestically and in oceans.<br>  9. High temperature reactors could produce Hydrogen as well as electricity.<br>  10. Fantastic safety record.<br>  11. Nuclear medicine<br>  12. Irradiation of food- reduce spoilage-safer food supply<br>  <br>  CONS<br>  1. Irrational fear of all things nuclear.<br>  2. High cost to build and license, large initial investment for long term pay back.<br>  3. Publicly accepted high level storage facility not domestically available.<br>  4. Reprocessing facility not domestically available.<br>  4. High cost of personnel.<br>  5. Security concerns, nothing can be totally secure.|`|mbvE0zTcaa	YES, + drill+wind+solar+clean coal.

I don't understand why because nuclear would significantly lower co2 emissions around the world.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Absolutely. It is the most viable alternative to fossil fuels. France and Japan both manage to get substantial energy from nuclear plants. The technology has been around for decades and it is constantly improving. <br>  <br>  Some cons are:<br>  <br>  1. High level radioactive waste must be stored for centuries. We aren't sure to store it to guarantee that it won't somehow be disturbed. <br>  <br>  2. Requires government regulation to verify that plants are being operated in a safe manner.

Clinton had Jamie Gorelick create the wall between the CIA and FBI so he wouldn't be tried for crimes reguarding the Ryadi Family in Indonesia and selling missile technology to China through Loral Space.  He also wouldn't be held accountable for placing the approval of top secret military applications with Ron Brown of the Commerce Dept. instead of where it had traditionally been with the State Department.  The Wall created kept Clinton in office and out of jail.  It also allowed a terrorist attack on the United States.  The Democrats managed to get Jamie Gorelick on the 9/11 commission to keep most of this from coming out.  What a rediculous whitewash.  For her efforts Clinton put her in at Fannie Mae and she was paid off with millions.  Clinton was given Obama bin Laden on 3 separate occasions and he refused to accept him.

OoHN2qjDaa	If you're trying to blame somebody for 9/11, i'd blame Bin Laden. <br>  <br>  If you're trying to blame someone for the "economic turmoil", i would blame any one who had a functioning position in politics or the government over the last 20 years. Economic crises such as this do not get started overnight.<br>  <br>  the word "responsibility" did not make sense in your question - i assumed you meant blame. <br>  <br>  Clearly, you didn't, and I just thought you to be smarter than you are.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Congress makes laws. they have nothing to do with enforcement. What could have congress done to stop 9/11? What bill should they have passed?<br>  <br>  "People lay blame/responsibility on one party for this generally as if it weren't a bi-partisan effort."<br>  <br>  Well that is wrong. The failure to prevent 9/11 had to do with a failure of the government in general. Political parties don't enter into it.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Democrats? Responsibility? HA!|`|AA11086243	er... they weren't the majority during 9-11? were they?<br>  <br>  and they weren't the majority when much of this crisis was forming?<br>  <br>  so I guess that's why?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Daschle has a slim majority in the Senate for the Dems... and Hassert had the house for the Republicans... <br>  <br>  so it was a split congress... and really, the Republicans had a much clearer majority overall, since the senate dems didn't have a supermajority...|`|HlTF3X3Baa	9/11:<br>         The tactic of terrorism was proved effective (validated)  by arafat & the PLO, who received foreign and moral support, because of idiots who attack Israel, any time they take action. Verbally & by threatening withdrawal of weapons contracts & alliance - this is how democrats have dealt with Israel for a long time.  <br>  <br>        When something works, you get more of it. How to invalidate the terrorism tactic? At some point, it becomes excessive. The culprits and supporters are hid amongst a populace. You send your army to kill a bunch of people, who have some affiliation. If the affiliation is weak, all the better - the idea is to terrorize in return. DEms have demonstrated and loudly proclaimed their complete lack of sense in these matters. Appeasement also caused WW2, at least the european part.<br>  <br>      Economic crisis: The credit bubble is a natural result of easy credit being administered at every sign of recession. Credit is not the disease, its more like a medicine that has been administered so much, that its become a bigger problem. Why did our economy need so much stimulus?  Because america became a poor place to manufacture, or extract resources. Laws made it more expensive- Equality laws, environmental laws, wage laws. And all these are enforced by lawyers and activist organisations, at a profit. And any time you find a retarded law that lawyers proit from, and sounds populist - its a democrat law.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Your premise is completely inaccurate.  The Democrats were not the majority party in 2001 and have not controlled either house of Congress until Jan., 2007 (and they did not have enough seats in the Senate to prevent a veto from President Bush from January, 2007 until January, 2009).  The U.S. President is responsible to uphold, defend the Constitution and to protect the American people from enemies foreign and domestic for which Bush was negligent on 9/11/01 after receiving the presidential daily briefing which stated that bin Laden was determined to attack inside the U.S.  Bush also was repeatedly warned by every intelligence agency that a growing threat was pervasive and imminent.  Bush was on vacation and did absolutely nothing to prevent an attacks.  The Democrats may be guilty of many things, but responsibility for 9/11 is not among them.|`|Hq6nSl1Qaa	As I have said repeatedly, politics in this country are largely based on "my team" and "your team" regardless of facts.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, I fail to see what Congress, regardless of party, has to do with pre-9/11.  Is there some kind of law that wasn't passed but should have?  Is there some kind of oversight or hearing that would have made it not happen?<br>  <br>  Terrorism is a law enforcement issue.  That is the only tool with the proper level of precision to effectively deal with complex networks of illegal activity.  It is remedial to believe the military is effective (long-term) against criminal networks, like a flint ax can be used to remove a benign brain tumor.  You can do it, but it will probably cause more damage and it should only be employed in the most desperate of situations.<br>  <br>  Law enforcement falls within the scope of the executive branch.  While funding for programs may be provided or withheld by Congress, the organization and day-to-day operations fall to the executive.  Congress was not involved when top level FBI brass in the International Terrorism Operations Section denied requests by Minneapolis and Phoenix agents to investigate participants of 9/11 earlier that year.<br>  <br>  So, unless you can think of something that Congress, Democrat or Republican, could or should have done to prevent 9/11...  I'm all ears.  It is the failure of career law enforcement personnel that allowed 9/11 to happen as it did.  And if Richard Reed would have blown up his sweaty shoes, I would not have blamed the Republican Congress.|`|W9IgwU4Paa	You should know the answer...democrats accept zero responsibility for ANYTHING.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	You know the answer - because they are in power and in cahoots with the media.

AA11041009	Gives the left less ground to hate the military.

D6t6SoFRaa	There was a fire code violation.  Under Federal Life Safety Codes, the school is in violation based on a student getting locked in the bathroom.

mSrnLnNcaa	I don't hate cops, I just think that they need an attitude check.|`|4kgNp1uPaa	Well those people need to realize that "traffic cops" and "police officers that solve crimes" are the same thing. They're assigned a different job everyday. Some times they can be on patrol, other times they can be hiding in a spot trying to catch speeders. Which is the main reason why people hate "traffic cops". Nobody likes to be caught speeding.<br>  Not all people hate cops. Law enforcement officers are well respected and essential to a normal society to function. How ever, people who're involved in criminal activities obviously don't like them. Police officers are the only ones allowed to legally take away a person's freedom (arrest some one) and everyone believes they're innocent. And many people believe that law enforcement officers think they're above the law, which is horribly wrong because the law is harsher on officers than normal people if they're caught breaking the law. <br>  It's a tough job but someone's gotta do it.|`|spPD3Mrzaa	I don't hate police; I even LOVE the idea of the "Peace Officer". Most motorists feel that their driver's license allows them to do whatever pleases them: here in CA, folks are still talking on hand held cell phones despite it being against the law. The problem is, with so many unpopular laws being enforced, folks get angry, and since the traffic cop is going to make life uncomfortable for them, the cop has to put up with the trash that gets talked!|`|b8svqAMAaa	Well lets see.  I am a Deputy Sheriff and do not hate cops.  Unfortunately we are not usually responding to a call where something good happened.  People tend to not like us because we do our jobs.  If someone needs to go to jail then we take them.  This doesn't usually set well with the violator and sometimes anyone related to them.  Taking people to jail is not a way to make friends.  We are not in this job to necessarily make friends, we are in it to serve and protect the people that need it.  Outside of always seeming like we are the bad guys, we do a lot of good as well.  It is the same people that don't like "cops" that call us when they are in need of one.  We don't hold that against anyone.  Stop and think of what we do all day, we can't be push overs but we don't have to be jerks either.  On every call I treat people with the same attitude in which they treat me.  Sometimes we have to be "jerks" to get our point across.  In general, I guess most of us are just not liked by people who disagree with what we have to do to do our jobs.<br>  <br>  We usually end up getting a "Thank You" at the end of our contact with people, even if it was after issuing a citation.|`|pRpgbuqiaa	Traffic cops exist because people who don't deserve them are given drivers licenses. In some cities in America, there is a code of ethics about how and how not to drive. In others, people don't care.|`|W9IgwU4Paa	I don't hate any cops.  I don't break the law, therefore I don't have a problem with them.  I did get a speeding ticket once but I was speeding so I deserved it!|`|AvAkwdGKaa	Only criminals and criminal supporters hate cops.|`|798a7b369cb5d5488af460fb639e81b2aa	No! just the FBI gestapo bastards!|`|2eVLgyToaa	my dad is a detective so i cant hate cops but. But i believe people don't see the balance that police officers bring to the world for example imagine living in a place with no cops people would be killing each other and no one to bring order.|`|L4r1kmPQaa	Cops are pretty nice people. Only ******* hate them...|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I don't mind cops at all.  If they give me a speeding ticket, it was because I was speeding.....if I'm mad, it's because I got caught! lol<br>  <br>  I take that back.  I hate fake cops and security guards that walk around with an undeserved sense of accomplishment.|`|V7JVKApkaa	Traffic cops and cops that respond to and solve crimes are generally the same cop. People just hate certain aspects of their job: to pull over drivers not operating safely or stop you from smoking pot.|`|f9No4eRBaa	The chances of being injured or killed is very high in an an automobile crash.  A young child has a higher probability of going to the hospital from a motor vehicle crash than from a sex pervert.<br>  A traffic cop does a job to keep orderly on the highway and people adhering to traffic laws. The Motor Vehicle crashes are bad now, think of the carnage on the highway without these traffic cops. Whether you want to acknowledge it or not, they are saving lives and injuries and should be given more respect.<br>  <br>  Yes, nobody wants to pay a traffic fine, especially when they get nothing in return. But that is the collateral damage to your pocket book if you want to exercise your privilege and drive a motor vehicle recklessly or with out due regard for traffic rules.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	The people that hate traffic cops hate them because they got a ticket from one usually!  They got caught doing something wrong, and instead of being mad at themselves for breaking the law ... they get mad at the authority figure that caught them.  It's kind of like children that hate their parents for grounding them, even though the child knows they did something wrong!<br>  <br>  I don't hate the police, I have got tickets from officers (deserved!  my bad!)  and I had to pay my fines.  After the first one I was ticked off at the officer for a few hours, then I realized that if I had not been driving 10 mph over the limit ... I would not have even been stopped!  <br>  <br>  I've only had a few tickets in 25 years of driving, sorry to admit that I deserved every one of them!|`|G6JXHvZKaa	I THINK IT IS JUST BECAUSE SOME  PERSONS ARE JUST AFRAID OF POLICEMEN MOST OF THE TIME A PERSONS FIRST TIME THEY ARE FACE TO FACE WITH A COP ITS WHILE DRIVING THEY JUST GET NERVOUS  OR THERE NOT SUCH GOOD PERSONS TO BE WITH !|`|psNeAz1Xaa	oh, i hope not! <br>  my uncle and three of my cousins are cops! one is a really important one around here, head of something or some another... and i really look up to them.

PBq7ODPzaa	Treasonous? No.  But, an officer that openly criticizes the civilian authority may be charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ is the code of law members of the military are subject to.)<br>  <br>  Specifically, Article 88 Contempt Towards Officials states;<br>    "Any commissioned officer who uses contemptuous words against the President, the Vice President, Congress, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Transportation, or the Governor or legislature of any State, Territory, Commonwealth, or possession in which he is on duty or present shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.” <br>  <br>  That being said, in the explanation of the article is also states;<br>     "If not personally contemptuous, ad-verse criticism of one of the officials or legislatures named in the article in the course of a political discussion, even though emphatically expressed, may not be charged as a violation of the article."|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	No.<br>  <br>  Because Patriotic People call Obama a Traitor.<br>  <br>  (Traitor is more accurate than Usurper.)

I am from MD so I know more about him then most of the country. He is a mean spirited person who never does anything good for anyone. He is just a big talking head who is there to defend the republicans in making sure no one gets anything. So what he has sent out is now coming back to him but I can't tell what is going to happen but now that you mention it, it wouldn't surprise me.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	He won't even stand up to Rush.

He may want to pour water into the tenets bucket and water it down, but the tenets are what they are.  If its between Steele or the reality of what the Republicans are at their core....he's out.

Homogenous characteristics in that which is based in ideology (like a political party) is the kiss of death.|`|AA11571284	I don't know, but there's a ton of politicians on both sides that need to resign.

AA11828121	My Brain, the "War on Terror" had nothing to do with 9/11, that's just what Bush labeled it to make everyone support him.<br>  <br>  REMEMBER we invaded first because Bush said there were weapons of mass destruction which were never found, but it was merely for oil. And the war on terror should have been about Bin Laden but it's funny how months after it was started Bush wasn't worried about him anymore......And he was the cause of 9/11. Bush didn't care, not at all.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Obama is stepping it up by moving troops from Iraq to Afghanistan. The war on terror is very much alive and kicking. THank god it is or there would have been a bunch more attacks on American and English Soil.  There was no phony war. Obama and Bush are not Warmongers. They are just trying to keep you safe is all. Try and relax and let intelligent people do their thing.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	I know you are frolicking in la la land where all of our enemies suddenly love us, but the reality is, we are a target of Iran, not to mention the terrorists training right on our soil.

The son of God wouldnt be in this country illegally.  The son of God would obey the 10th Commandment:<br>  <br>  Exodus 20:17 "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ***, nor any thing that [is] thy neighbour's."<br>  <br>  Question answered....for oh, about the 246th time.

I, for one, would never "deport" the Son of God.  He is the reason why we all have an opportunity at life.  He has given you and I and the rest of the human population the beautiful gift of life.  And, one of the reasons He has given you and I life is to spread the message that He has blessed us all with.  And, the message is that He can give us all peace with the reassurance that He sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to die for us so that we may live in Heaven and have everlasting life.<br>  I firmly believe that ALL humans have the right to have freedom in all they do.....even religion.  I also think that the United States needs to make it a little easier for someone to become a legal citizen of the U.S......but the immigrants from all over the world should realize that if they do become a citizen of our country, then they need to be responsible and pay taxes like the rest of the country.  They also should have responsibility to cover their own medical costs.  And, I think that's what the majority of Americans want......,and that's the reason why alot of Americans are so angry.<br>  Also, if you do become a legal resident, you should also suffer the consequences of crime.......not only if you are a legal resident, but also illegal.  And, alot of Americans are extremely frustrated with that issue as well.|`|BWlcmjc6aa	The Son of God is around today.  I am sorry you don't see Him.  His presence is not as easily dismissed as some might think.|`|UiUPOA0laa	Nah, I think he would have partial ownership considering his father created the U.S. The illegal aliens are nothing near greatness.|`|RkK56aunaa	The Son of God would probably not go around breaking the law.|`|4GXyiowSaa	Do we deport anybody?|`|FFu7wS7Jaa	would you deport a man that can send you to hell for the rest of eternity?<br>  Didn't think so|`|v8XK80Ycaa	YES...Get a GREEN CARD like everyone else!!!

I know things were bad when Bush was in office, but Obamas not making it better, he's making it much worse!  And I believe he's doing it to lead us into socialism, which I don't care what anyone tells you, is not a good thing!  I challenge anyone to tell me a successful socialist country!|`|7UFta5tcaa	You will be able to say thank you, to him when we go under the NEW WORLD ORDER.

Look what Obama has done to the stock market . New 12 year lows. The guy is an absolute friggin disaster.  He knows ZERO about the economy or maybe he just wants to destroy it on purpose.<br>  <br>  I've got mine, but alot more  Obama supporters are going to realize maybe this wasn't such a good thing to raise taxes on the "rich" when they are laid off by their bosses because of Obama's higher tax burden on employers. Add in the reducing away mortgage interest and charitable giving and look out. You reap what you sow Obama supporters. But oh you will get a little more money in your unemployment check so good luck and thanks Barry.|`|B42PBRk6aa	That is THE GOAL.<br>  When we've fallen so far because of his stupid policies, he will use fear and desperation to assume dictator status.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Yes and he's doing it with full knowledge and intention. He wants to bring down the world so we'll all bow down to him. He must be stopped.|`|57IDs4byaa	Yes. I also believe that we will have more terrorist attacks on our country than ever before.

7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	They cite charities, which yes, are a big part of it, but the less emphasized fact of limit deductions taken worries them most. They know that they can't get away with their own tax evading now that so many Americans have been made painfully aware of how they are all tax cheats themselves. Americans are visiting the government pages more than ever...and more people than ever....the days of going about their business with no scrutiny are screeching to a halt.|`|CvFajKPUaa	dems and liberals are for big government control and weak economy, look at what they have both done in the past, bunch of worthless bastards their too busy wondering who their dad is to actually read a book|`|Q82K0pQFaa	As always, all authorities are appointed by God to finalize His plan, not man's.

Would you expect them to?|`|UpZFb6X5aa	This is a good example of th fundamental difference between todays Repubicans and Americans (not just Democrats."<br>  <br>  We don't need to be in lockstep and blindly support Obama on every single point. Open discussion and disagreements aren't a "lack of support"--they are constructive crtiticism.<br>  <br>  The right wing thinks "unity" or "uuport" means silencing dissent. It isn't. Nor is it respect.<br>  <br>  Obama will make better decisions if he is challenged and if he listenes to people who DON'T agree with him. He knows that--he's made a point of including people with opposing viewpoints in his administration.<br>  <br>  So--what's that differecnce I spoke of?<br>  <br>  Republicans are too fearful to tolerate dissent in their ranks.<br>  Americans welcome dissent. We are strong enough--and confident enough in the value s of freedom and open expression of ideas--not to fear being challenged or criticized.<br>  <br>  BTW--I happen to agree with Obama on this--and flatly disagree with some of this critics on this point. But I WANT them to speak up. We will get better poicies and ideas if those policies and ideas are challenged, tested, debated, and refined.|`|nhWTN3uhaa	I think we can get rid of the label Liberals now and just use the word socialists.  So I would say the Socialist are supporting Obama.  It is the non socialist who actually know what the word means who have started to abanden Obama.

Wanting to see the country go completely socialist and down the drain is another.  A few notable Libs are waking up to the fact that Obama is an extremist with an agenda that does not include prosperity and ending the current recession so much as turning the country on a hard left political agenda toward income redistribution and formation of a new welfare state.|`|6pdwd3PZaa	Obama is just too far left for even the liberals...scarey.<br>  Also, they want to be re-elected and they know the elections are only two years away....and they KNOW Obama is going to far  with his spending.|`|USJzKGABaa	Don't worry; most liberals are still supporting him.

Incest is the oldest and most wide spread taboo. Legalize gay marriage if you want, just don't confuse the issue. If We were talking legalization of two homosexual people getting married, I wouldn't have an issue. Today, however, we would see a move towards more than two people (polygamy, etc.). That really isn't the definition of marriage, and we need to make another legally binding contract for those types of unions.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Oddly, opponents of gay marriage use the slippery slope example that you've cited. For some reason, they feel (or say they feel) that allowing two unrelated consenting adult humans to marry is what would lead to the law saying that any two living beings can marry. However, as you point out, allowing two people of different genders to marry now should have led, by now, to allowing any two people of different genders to marry. Since that hasn't happened, there is no reason to believe that allowing same-sex marriage would lead to anything else.|`|bVJSlo3Raa	Sorry I like the person who said I don't really understand how you get to this conclusion. When it was people like her who somehow got to the conclusion about people marrying animals. <br>  <br>  Rediculaous now the term they use for marriage is religous (I am a christian but still) In all other times marriage is a union between any two people it is only religion that dictates it is between a man and a woman.<br>  <br>  If you get my point.

The dinosaurs allowed boy dinosaurs to marry other boy dinosaurs and pretty soon there were no dinosaurs left.  You can't argue with science!!!<br>  <br>  Twelve reasons gay marriage is wrong:<br>  <br>  1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning. Also apparently those homosexual animals have picked up some unnatural behavior.<br>  <br>  2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.<br>  <br>  3) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.<br>  <br>  4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.<br>  <br>  5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.<br>  <br>  6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.<br>  <br>  7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.<br>  <br>  8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.<br>  <br>  9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.<br>  <br>  10) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.<br>  <br>  11) Gay marriage should be decided by the people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of minorities.<br>  <br>  12) Civil Unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will.|`|diCASlUXaa	look at all the people who claims "gays threaten the sanctity of marriage":<br>  <br>  Newt Gingirch:<br>  -married 3 times<br>  -dumped his 1st wife while she was in the hospital<br>  -cheated on his 2nd wife<br>  -refused to attend his own sister's wedding<br>  <br>  Rush Limbaugh<br>  -divorced 3 times<br>  -his 1st marriage only lasted 3 years<br>  <br>  Rudy Giuliani<br>  -married 3 times<br>  -his 1st wife was his own cousin<br>  -his 2nd wife also married 3 times<br>  -his 3rd wife also married 3 times<br>  -his own daughter wouldn't vote for him<br>  -he dresses in drag<br>  <br>  John McCain<br>  -married twice<br>  -dumped his 1st wife, who was the same age as him & stood by him while he was in captivity, for a younger richer woman with 100 million dollars.<br>  <br>  Fred Thompson:<br>  -married twice<br>  -married a woman young enough to be his daughter.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Convoluted, nonsensical questions do not prove how astute and cunning you are.

6OLiuM9Gaa	Opinion?<br>  <br>  (1) Welcome to the adult world of having to suffer the consequences of your decisions.<br>  <br>  (2)  The decision, as I see it, yours alone. How badly do you want to be a Marine? I guess not badly enough to spend a semester in junior college (that's how long it takes to amass 15 credits as a full-time student). For some reason you'd rather attend high school for three years... and you really aren't enthused about that option either.<br>  <br>  Some things to consider. The trend of the party currently in power has been to decimate the military. The last Democratic President closed about half of the bases. When I was in the Navy, the Exchange was the place to purchase good quality products inexpensively. Today you see almost as many uniforms at "Winco" and "COSTCO" as you do at the base Exchanges. I live at a Veterans Home where there's an Exchange... and it's often less expensive for me to get in the car and drive 20 miles to a Target, Staples, Winco, or COSTCO.<br>  <br>  And with the "down sizing" the military is being forced into, it's going to get tougher to get in... not easier. Not too long ago some guy posted a similar question... and he was 28... and none of the branches wanted him... and he didn't understand why. So, you can sit on your backside for a few more years and be in the same boat he's in... or you can make up your mind and do something now. Now you have options. In a few years you may not.<br>  <br>  If being a Marine is something you really want to do, then don't ask permission. Do whatever it takes to do to get there.<br>  <br>  I was in the Navy for 25 years. I was enlisted for about four years and an officer for the rest.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	You sound like you are in a similar situation my husband was in.

7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Yes, it is the entire government. If anyone rationally thought about it, each party has promised sweeping changes over decades of their jockeying in power. Those significant changes (that a majority agree with) always come to fruition as some kind of compromise instead of the true change--just enough to feed the masses an illusion of keeping promises.

But, under the name of "liberalism," they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation, without knowing how it happened."<br>  <br>  He went on to say:  "I no longer need to run as a Presidential Candidate for the Socialist Party.

Of the 9000-odd "earmarks" in the current rescue bill, over 3000 come from Republicans.  I don't think either party is squeaky clean.  The problem is a general sense of entitlement and ignorance of the 'common' person, by those in government.

The government has no right to spread the wealth of working people out to failures who do nothing of the sort. Our liberties are being sacrificed for security in the names of protecting ourselves from all forms of terrorism.  But, even today an Arab might walk on through airport security even easiar then an old grandma can.  Losing our liberties isn'benefitingng anyone unless they cherish sticking their heads in the sand to secure that they don't lose it.  The system is and always will be corrupt if the right citizens never come forward to uprise the government.  The people are allowing these things to happen.  If many people went ahead and demanded change the government would have to work along with everyone.  But, not everyone has a backbone, and are spineless to rising up against the bloated burecratic government we have here.|`|ejluOCdTaa	I don't know!<br>  I guess they feel it is okay to infringe upon the rights of those who are successful.....all it means to me is they are stealing from the richer and given to the poorer....the robin hood government
c3vPZfghaa	NO<br>  <br>  matter of fact there comes a point where market forces stifle innovation and prevent competition.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	the classic answer of economists is "no".<br>  <br>  however, they qualify that answer with a description of the circumstances under which markets break down and an admonition to governments that the purpose of laws is to patch the circumstances so the market can then function properly.<br>  <br>  <br>  classic example:  when the need of one party is highly urgent and immediate, that person has no bargaining power because s/he can't walk away to find another provider.<br>  <br>  this comes up in health care regularly -- in the ER any true emergency case has an urgent [life or death] and immediate need.  s/he is therefore in no position to bargain for price with the ER [nor with the ambulance service that brings them to the ER].  It follows that a properly managed government will set the prices charged in the ER.<br>  <br>  Of course, once the government sticks its nose into the tent by setting the price, the ER has no bargaining power and can not turn away patients who are unable to pay.  It thus follows that government should [but tries not to] guarantee the bills of such emergency patients.  If government says that hospitals can't turn patients away, then it should be the government's responsibility to see that the price controlled bill is actually paid in a timely fashion.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  It rather follows that there are other situations where there is such an imbalance in bargaining power that government "should" step in and control either the terms of the deal or the price or both.<br>  <br>  An artfully crafted government policy in such cases will preserve the market as much as possible.<br>  <br>  thousands to millions of independent decision makers are a great deal more efficient than some central government committee -- which is why Communism collapsed due to continuing economic failure.<br>  <br>  **does this help?<br>  <br>  :)

I agree. But it's so much fun to argue with these idiots.
AA10583158	Good question, Zapper. Obama is trying to get government control of the banks, healthcare and everything. This nation is headed toward socialism in which the government will have control. The US has always been a capitalist nation. Pretty soon, if Obama has his way, you will have a government controlled healthcare, government controlled banks, etc. Then you will find that you don't have freedom of speech. All your freedoms will be taken away one by one. People need to open their eyes and see what is really going down. Obama has yet to prove that he was born in the U.S. which is a must to be president of the US. Therefore, I will not call him president. His mother was white, his dad was black who abandoned him and his white grandparents raised him. All you hear though is that we have our first black president. Hello?|`|2a9MLpZRaa	I'm not whining, and I don't think they'd even attempt to take my freedoms.

From the other side of the fence..................<br>  <br>  <br>  Received the following from someone who worked at S.W. BELL in Mexico City:<br>  <br>  'I spent five years working in Mexico. I worked under a tourist Visa for three months and could legally renew it for three more months. After that you were working Illegally. I was technically illegal for three weeks waiting on the FM3 approval.<br>  <br>  'During that six months our Mexican and U.S. attorneys were working to secure a permanent work visa called a 'FM3'. It was in addition to my U.S. passport that I had to show each time I entered and left the country. My wife's was the same, except hers did not permit her to work.<br>  <br>  'To apply for the FM3, I needed to submit the following notarized originals (not copies):<br>  <br>  1. Birth certificate for my wife and me.<br>  2. Marriage certificate.<br>  3. High school transcripts and proof of graduation.<br>  4. College transcripts for every college I attended and proof of graduation.<br>  5. Two letters of recommendation from supervisors I had worked for at least one year.<br>  6. A letter from the St. Louis Chief of Police indicating that I had no arrest record in the U.S. and no outstanding warrants and, was 'a citizen in good standing.<br>  7. 'Finally, I had to write a letter about myself that clearly stated why there was no Mexican citizen with my skills and why my skills were important to Mexico. We called it our 'I am the greatest person on Earth' letter. It was fun to write.<br>  <br>  'All of the above were in English that had to be translated into Spanish and be certified as legal translations, and our signatures notarized. It produced a folder about 1.5 inches thick with English on the left side an d Spanish on the right.<br>  <br>  Once they were completed my wife and I spent about five hours, accompanied by a Mexican attorney, touring Mexican government office locations and being photographed and fingerprinted at least three times at each location, and we remember at least four locations where we were instructed on Mexican tax, labor, housing, and criminal law and that we were required to obey their laws or face the consequences. We could not protest any of the government's actions or we would be committing a felony. We paid out four<br>  thousand dollars in fees and bribes to complete the process. When this was done we could legally bring in our household goods that were held by U.S. Customs in Laredo, Texas. This meant we had rented furniture in Mexico while awaiting our goods. There were extensive fees involved here that the company paid.<br>  <br>  'We could not buy a home and were required to rent at very high rates and under contract and compliance with Mexican law.<br>  <br>  'We were required to get a Mexican driver' s license. This was an amazing process. The company arranged for the licensing agency to come to our headquarters location with their photography and fingerprint equipment and the laminating machine. We showed our U.S. license, were photographed and fingerprinted again and issued the license instantly after paying out a six dollar fee. We did not take a written or driving test and never received instructions on the rules of the road. Our only instruction was to never give a<br>  policeman your license if stopped and asked. We were instructed to hold it against the inside window away from his grasp. If he got his hands on it you would have to pay ransom to get it back. 'We then had to pay and file Mexican income tax annually using the<br>  number of our FM3 as our ID number. The company's Mexican accountants did this for us and we just signed what they prepared. It was about twenty legal size pages annually.<br>  <br>  'The FM3 was good for three years and renewable for two more after paying more fees.<br>  <br>  'Leaving the country meant turning in the FM3 and certifying we were leaving no debts behind and no outstanding legal affairs (warrants, tickets or liens) before our household goods were released to customs.'<br>  <br>  'It was a real adventure and if any of our Senators or Congressmen went through it once, they would have a different attitude toward Mexico.<br>  <br>  'The Mexican government uses its vast military and police forces to keep its citizens intimidated and compliant. They never protest at their capitol or government offices, but do protest daily in front of the United States Embassy. The U.S. Embassy looks like a strongly reinforced fortress and during most protests the Mexican military surrounds the block with their men standing shoulder to shoulder in full riot gear to protect the embassy. These protests are never shown on U.S. or Mexican TV. There is a large public park across the street where they do their protesting.

The state can legislate taxes as they see fit as long as it is within the powers given by the constitution (which they seem to forget).<br>    The feds keep mandating social programs for states which in turn causes the states to run out of cash (Ca. for 1).

And the only reason they kept Arizona is that their nominee was from there.  (If McCain had been from CO, NM or NV, he'd have won that State and lost AZ.) And Democrats have won House, Senate and Governors' races in places like Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Montana and the Dakotas.<br>  <br>  So I wouldn't hang my hat on that Chicago Congressional race if I were you.

nwMBfgcdaa	It really all depends on where you work.  Some places work under the principle that seniority rules.  Senior guys get promoted over junior officers.  If there are alot of people with 10-20 years on, you aren't going anywhere soon.  Now if you are in a Police force with alot of retirements or anticipated retirements, you can move up quickly.  I know of one force with 60% of the officers with under 5 years experience.  They are putting guys with 5 years in investigative sections.  <br>  Some forces are realizing that seniority does not always mean they are the best for the job.  That betters your chances as a junior member to move up if you work to deserve it.<br>  Here, you can't get into any sections (investigative) for five years unless no one else applies (not likely).  You can't right for Sgt. position without 10 years.  There is no Corporal rank.   There is also no detectives.  The guys in the investigative sections are Cst. and Major Crime is Cst. or Sgt. <br>  Basically it isn't too hard.  Put your time in, work hard in the field you aspire to (IE-if you want to be in the drug section, work hard at getting your own drug charges on the street).  You will be successful eventually, maybe not right away.<br>  ETA- In Canada, Constable is the title for the lowest rank Police officer.<br>  <br>  ETA (again)-  you should have no problems in a force the size of Toronto.  They seem to be very progressive and are very large.   There are tons of different sections.  It would just be a matter of putting in your time required by contract to go in a section, then showing through your work you deserve it.  <br>  BTW-I know several officers that came from Toronto.  They are some of the best, well trained officers I have met.|`|9I3wHIdraa	First off it depends upon your state.  In Texas a constable works for a judge or justice of the peace and delivers warrants.  Many of them can barely fir in their patrol car.
cr5EoqVjaa	Yes, most people do use these terms interchangeably. But I agree that that not all Republicans are conservative and not all conservatives are republicans.|`|secffswqaa	Conservatives are about restraining the Federal Government to the boundaries placed on it by the constitution.  Most Republicans fall way outside this definition.<br>  <br>  While holding traditional values might be considered conservative, they aren't at all related to being a political Conservative.  It is true that many of the hard core fundamentalists live in the Republican tent, this doesn't make them conservative.  Often times fundamentalists wish to use Federal power to enforce their morals, which is anti-Conservative.<br>  <br>  By definition Conservatives are color blind.  Branding Conservatives as racist because David Duke has participated in the Republican party is unfair.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	In theory you are correct, of course.<br>  <br>  However, the practice is the problem. Look, legitimate conservatives  are people that  I generally respect (though I frequently disagree with them!). However, today's "conservative" end of the political spectrum is dominated by racists, ideologues, and religious extremists. So is the GOP.<br>  <br>  Now, ere's the problem. Legitimate conservatives have not spoken out against this. Instead, they have remained silent and condoned the excesses of the far right by their silence and their votes. On the rare occasion when one has spoken out, as Michael Steele did the other day about Rush LImbaugh, all it takes is one snarl from the far right and they apoligize and crawl.<br>  <br>  When the real conservatives in America start standing up to the extremists--then they will deserve to be considered a seperate group. As long as they don't have the guts to separate themselves from the trash, they have no complain at being classed with the trash.<br>  <br>  "Lie down with dogs, get up with fleas."|`|El4L6jRmaa	Republica is a political view, a smart one.

YupMCYHlaa	Rush doesn't debate.  Never has.  The question got me curious so I looked it up and yes, apparently he has challenged Obama to a debate on his own program.  <br>  <br>  If Rush was really interested in rational discussion rather than bloviating and lying, there are many good liberal spokesmen who could clean his clock good and proper.  You never see liberals on Limbaugh's show.  If he wants you to know what liberals think, he'll tell you himself, of course that's -his- version of liberalism.  They do have 'liberals' sometimes on Fox, but they are not real liberals, they're punching bags. They interrupt them, talk over them, bully them, and tell them to 'shut up'.<br>  <br>  I think Rush is bluffing.  Obama won't come on his show, and I don't think he should.  I don't think he would treat Obama with respect.<br>  <br>  I think Rush knows what kind of trouble he's in.  His party has been severely damaged and discredited by Bush.  His style of windbag propaganda, hyperbolic attack rhetoric, is going out of style as the party tries to look more reasonable and less bombastic.  Rush's ratings are in free-fall.  But the gasbags of the party are still in control, as shown by Michael Steele's forced apology.  They are going to do even more damage to the party, and to themselves.  An appearance by the President of the United States would only dignify Limbaugh.  He doesn't deserve it.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	You are pathetically mindless!

Now is the time to strengthen and stabilize our economy.  America isn't Rush Limbaugh's, The GOP, The DNC, Congress, or President Obama's playground.

If you think Rush is such an idiot, then whats Obama have to lose?|`|b21fc34917b458cf7b37456bede7feb9aa	He thinks he important enough to have our President even answer him on it? What a hoot! Our president would not lower himself to speak with him!
Ij02BDygaa	Tell the teacher in your government class that they are a moron, Sure people make money from war, but its not your average joe who does, Its big shots of companys like haliburtan etc,<br>  <br>  Are you young? Where is your sense of humanity, Do you think that killing other humans is ok? Well its not, Im not haven a rant at you but you need to be more clever if your gonna ask stuff like this.<br>  <br>  Tell your teacher that this Depression is engineered by the very banks that have been giving the bailout money, Its design is to take people further into debt so they cant pay there bills,rent or morgage and eventually for food, If there is any about, Give it a year and people will be going to Fema camps, If you want to learn listen to Alex Jones, Infowars, Manoftruth etc, Get yourself informed and educated!|`|V6aH1vpQaa	We already did, and it's not doing too great for the economy.  We are spending billions and billions, but we are giving the money to rich private contractors instead of GIs.  Fail.|`|OoHN2qjDaa	I'm going to go with a big NO on that one<br>  <br>  Considering the type of warfare available today that wasn't available sixty years ago, there wouldn't be any people left to stimulate the economy if a WWIII were to occur.|`|Dpzk9w0Naa	em, No.|`|uGkLRQsxaa	no, we should never want to start a war|`|m24wuDzwaa	Sure, let's kill a few million people so we can drive volvos.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	of course not.<br>  don't be ridiculous|`|4eLzY2hfaa	if we're gonna do it we had better do it quick!  or there won't be any money left to get it off the ground!!
mbvpWNMeaa	To know the nationality of the baby, you would have to know the nationality of the parents because some countries count by the mother, some by the father and some by both.  Their marital status can also have an impact.  It would also help to know if the ship is publicly owned and if so, by what government.  The government of the country which was determined to be the nationality of the child would have jurisdiction to prosecute, but would have to obtain an extradition order from the French government.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	The baby's nationality is the nationality of the parents. If the parents are American, the baby is American regardless of where in the world it's born.<br>  <br>  The man would be arrested in France and extradited to the US to face the murder charge.|`|AA12119076	The baby would be the nationality of the mother, and the man would be charged under International Maritime Law.

The nation where the boat is registered has jurisdiction. <br>  Being born of American parents does not automatically make the baby an American citizen. I was born in Germany, have a German birth certificate, and didn't become (officially) a citizen until the paperwork was submitted after we returned to the U.S.|`|htSZsds7aa	the baby is the nationality of the mother .and the murderer would be charged by the registration country of the boat.
El4L6jRmaa	yes, first bailout, then healthcare, then the secret police raid your home and kill your family. i wish i was kidding|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	No, and stop making things up.
8Ev0yYwdaa	You can marry one, this is the quickest, and will take 9 years (marry until you get the green card and then divorce and be on a green card status until you are a citizen).<br>  In 6 months you can't get a thing, maybe a green card in 8 months if you marry an american tomorrow that will take you to the US.|`|VElNUno7aa	Swim across the Rio Grande and demand citizenship.
Ucbnl7VJaa	I think David B has the only accurate answer so far. He is age 35 years or over and he is an American citizen(though there are some to contest that being true). Those are THE qualifications to be President of the United States of America. There are no other qualifications in our Constitution. George Washington didn't have blah, blah number of years experience as a representative, senator, governer or anything else when he became President. How many people complain that he wasn't qualified? <br>  <br>  I still think we should not elect ANYONE  president who has ever stated "Someday I want to be the President" or any variation there of. Not counting stuff said as little kids of course. Anyone who wants to stress danger and ridicule enough to spend ten to twenty years in politics to get into that office is someone who has too much of his/her own "I want to be in charge"power trip going on.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	No....he has NO expierance...even Palin had more but Libs are unable to tell the difference between FACTS and SPEW from the mouth of their beloved Messiah that they drool all over themselves for...|`|KZh3x4g9aa	no,he is a marxist with his own agenda.you want facts,google "marxist".|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	As qualified as McCain would have been.  No one running had previous experience being President of the United States so neither had experience going into the job.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	As George Will said he has the thinnest resume since Wendall Wilkie. So no, he does not.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	nope, He has no experience that would make him qualified.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	He's over 35 and an American citizen so according to the Constitution, yes.|`|a5df43498b3c2fd7f8e660dc0eb09708aa	Since there is no written template on presidential experience, yes!<br>  <br>  He meets the a few minimum requirements that have been in place so far; Male, Christian, White (half).<br>  <br>  Let us not forget, he has a degree in Constitutional Law. Considering the financial situation we are in right now, was George Bush qualified to run this country or any other?|`|ayBzdRK7aa	no way jose!<br>  <br>  he is a baby killer!! so that's the number one reason i don't like him!<br>  <br>  he also wants to raise taxes to pay for every bad financial decision people make. i really don't want to have to pay for the house that somebody couldn't really afford!! <br>  <br>  he is a great speech maker. i'll give him that. during the first speeches he gave, i though i really liked him. cause he is an inspirational speaker. but being an inspirational speaker doesn't qualify you to be president. it qualifies you to give a lecture down at the marriot!
M8IrNU3Baa	Well, considering that the average income of an American is below $50,000 and that the number of people who make over $250,000 per year is under 3%, I would say that qualifies as rich.|`|Lcr9FGS1aa	its pretty well off...i can support a family of 4,with a mortgage,quite well on 100k|`|SzsrajV4aa	I think if you can support a family and yourself, you are rich. Anything more than that is just greed.<br>  <br>  So if you ask me, 250K is definitely more than enough to be considered a rich family. I don't think my household combined would make anywhere near that kind of income, but we get by just fine and we're happy. I consider that rich.|`|028b4045d26c8c74302a643d0f4ae39daa	Well if that's a low income then I don't know what I am.  I must be compared to a piece of dirt.  I don't think taking the rich is going to solve anything.  But, truly I think that the majority should pay some taxes.  But taxation is a horrible way to screw everyone.  Because government spending is a bit ridiculous and the money doesn't always go to a sensible cause.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	EVERYONE who pays taxes is going to be Punished.<br>  <br>  That is Okay with Democrats.<br>  <br>  Most of them don't pay taxes, anyway.<br>  <br>  Edit*******  Have you noticed how Jealous the Answers are of anyone making $250k?<br>  Many Democrats won't work--- but are Jealous of people who do.<br>  I don't make anywhere near $250k, but I don't lay around, waiting for the govt to give me handouts, and whining.<br>  <br>  Maybe Democrats should get Jobs instead of being Jealous.|`|SS1VReF0aa	No, I would agree that $250 K is rich...what concerns me is that he feels they owe everyone else something for being successful.|`|X81oLqMtaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  I wish I was making $250k/yr.<br>  <br>  If I did, I might complain.  <br>  <br>  But until then.|`|FkPP6NVeaa	If you think that US is a rich country, then probably a half of americans are rich? The median income in this country was $32140 in 2006. So anyone making more than $32140 is rich! <br>  <br>  $250K is more than $32140 ->  so Obama is right!<br>  <br>  If you think US is not so rich and just 5% of american households are rich, then the number goes to $167K<br>  <br>  $250K is more than $167K ->  so Obama is right again!<br>  <br>  If you think US is a poor country and only 1.5% of americans are rich  <br>  then Obama is right again, since only 1.5% of households have more than $250K.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	Do you make 250k?<br>  <br>  I doubt it...<br>  <br>  And yeah, thats pretty well to do. Definitely rich.<br>  <br>  Not obscenely wealthy of course... but its still only the top 3% of americans. The rest of us look up to that... way up.<br>  <br>  And the whole idea that its all "hard-working business people who worked hard to earn success" is BS. Sure theres some of that in there, but over 88% of rich people were born into wealth or given their business. In other words... LUCKY.|`|VRHrppXRaa	No, that's the minimum amount for a person to make before they could invest in the same kind of things rich people invest in legally. <br>  <br>  So in other words, 250k is legally "rich"|`|38a6a271a6f3afff0a706e5aae1f9057aa	Ask the people working for minimum wage.<br>  <br>  I make a good living, but I'd be HAPPY to make 125K a year, have my husband make the same, and pay more in taxes.  I would be thrilled.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Yes. A LOT of us are very concerned. Most of the so-called rich are small business owners like me that employ people, pay taxes, etc. Rich is not a bad word.|`|AA12341057	It wasn't too low for you when Bush used it as the bottom line for his biggest tax cuts, why should it be too low now?|`|cNv5PZTSaa	hey i think a lot of people would be happy to make 250k +<br>  <br>  sorry if that's not enough money for you beverly hills fags|`|BYeEVLDQaa	$125,000 a year  isn't much??? ........must be nice.|`|a5df43498b3c2fd7f8e660dc0eb09708aa	Considering the average American makes $44,000 per year, 250k is light years beyond that. <br>  <br>  250k can be considered rich; 13 million is considered to be a millionaire, wealthy is when money works for you and not the other way around.<br>  <br>  People that complain about his politics will be cash his stimulus check without complaint.|`|ayBzdRK7aa	obamas definition of EVERYTHING concerns me! <br>  <br>  haha it made me laugh during his speech the other day when he was talking about that girl who wrote a letter about her school. cause later he was talking about how schools with good grades will get more money. and its sorta like...ummm i'm pretty sure that little girl's school that is falling apart probably doesn't have the highest test scores!!<br>  <br>  he just doesn't understand anything!! i don't agree with any of his positions. i think people were blinded by the fact that he is black. they'll regret voting for a man because he'd be the first african american prez! silly america! racism isn't just against blacks!|`|Rsr8nngWaa	That's 10 times the poverty line for a family of five. I think that unless you're in LA, NYC, or a similarly high cost-of-living place to live, $250k a year would qualify as rich. If not rich, it's at least enough where a higher tax wouldn't end the world.|`|5trqBrG5aa	if you are a making 250 thousand a year.<br>  and you divide that up by 12 months<br>  your bringing in about 20 grand a month.<br>  some families make about only 20 grand a year.|`|XZrOWQokaa	<a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=303952499910291" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles...</a><br>  <br>  Like father like son|`|SHwuzsPyaa	im a rich man<br>  <br>  rich in life accomplishments and experiences along with family and friends..<br>  <br>  i guess i need a bailout =\|`|IinVLhoMaa	The super rich are only 1% of the population.

These men have been lying to and exploiting our children for ages.  The change in simplest form is that we have a BLACK man as president when only 50 years ago he wouldn't have been allowed in most public places. If you have to ask, you have been duped not by Obama, but by the institution that strives to keep the poor poorer and the rich even richer.
3755f813b1d516d25ce2a6e43bcf7a9daa	they'd freak|`|W9IgwU4Paa	That's the least of my worries right now, but they would probably say "America finally woke up and voted that idiot out of office."|`|XTopfG8Taa	I believe he would make other countries get their s*#t together and they might not like it, but i would.|`|3h37vetbaa	They would wig out!|`|u2HV0MaHaa	Since when do Americans care what other countries think?

xB8EAIjLaa	Your best bet would be to talk to your recruiter.  They'll be able to tell you what all you have to take.  You will go through a lot of entry paperwork and health stuff at your local MEPS.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about getting the same shot twice, by that time they will have whatever paperwork that you have given them and will have things sorted out.<br>  <br>  I went through RTC about 7 years ago and I remember the day you get all your shots.  There's footprint outlines on the deck and as you take a step forward you get a shot in each arm.  It's quick and not bad at all.  My biggest advice would be to not tighten up when you go for your penicillin shot, that'll make it hurt worse.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember that it's their job to yell at everyone.  Don't take it personally.  Just pay attention to details, do what you're told and you'll do fine.
leM3RQ5Haa	FOX, of course.  I'd be embarrassed to work for the stations that constantly have to air retractions.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Whichever paid the best.<br>  <br>  And you do realize that you keep saying "cable news network" which is CNN.|`|1amF7oNwaa	FOX NEWS IT IS THE NUMBER ONE RATED.|`|AA11086243	er... probably a major network news... they are by far more respected and more watched... <br>  <br>  it's real news compared to cable clowns...
gnRiLwSxaa	Communism is virtually dead all over the world.   The Russians and Chinese, the largest communist nations, are going more capitalistic day by day, because communism doesn't work.    The communist party in the USA is almost a joke, and no one pays any attention to them or what they say.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	The Communist International is behind Radical Islam as well.|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Yeah I watched that, it was great!

kJM65nXJaa	No, I'm not Republican. I do think It began with Reagan.|`|zmmP52P3aa	looking for people with experiences similar to yours, eh?|`|I6dcRgD6aa	No, I am not a republican but I know that happened to them. They feared terrorists. Now they fear their boss will go out of business if he has to pay his fair share of taxes while he can well afford this. They fear they would lose their job when if the boss did he would still have to work anyway but they don't think about how he needs them so he isn't giving up his huge salary to go out of business. If he went out of business someone else would take his customers & might not make as much money & pay them more. They just don't think & live in fear. Now they have as their leaders Rush who scares them all the time. They have Jindal who they got a good look at & even Kenneth the Page is slapping him down. They have Steele who is the meanest most immature air head around who actually comes from the black elties from Montgomery county, MD. So actually, the cowardice is only just begining. They need guns cause they don't know God gave them arms that can keep them safe. What a mess & queen Sarah just got knocked down a few pegs when her daughter said she couldn't understand why people thought her mother wouldn't give her a choice, well duh, doesn't she know her mother is not pro=choice for other females outside the family & geeze she has to pay back the $7000 she stole from the tax payers. karma is starting to catch up with them for all their attacks so they have reason to be fearful for once.|`|bVJSlo3Raa	I know someone who was, they called it THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.|`|pgdTmT6caa	Wouldn't even think of it but a lot of people did this time.|`|Dh8i9msPaa	I don't think anyone believes that about themselves.<br>  What are you getting at?|`|Jq5WK8caaa	I would agree with you on political parties.  They are little more then organized crime organizations themselves.  If your a investor, look at who lobbies congress, how much the spend on lobbing, then look at how much money was given directly to them from the stimulus bills that had been passed.  It is clear evidence of pay to play.  This will continue till American people start to participate in civil disobedience.  Once the American Government has there own Boston Massacre, the American people will be galvenized and call for a impeachment of there elected officials.  If the Government should choose to resist, many will fight brother against brother, soldier against soldier and so on so forth.  James Madison was fearful of a majority rule system as it disregarded individual freedoms and rights.  Once the group becomes more important, if your group is in the in crowd, its only a matter of time before the needs of the many out way your needs.  You will be without power  to sway the government anymore and they are they are just like us.  It is good that we take care of the poor.  Ann Coulter while she has a personality of sand paper has a good point when she examined single parents.  Moms who are left and dependent on government do not wish that there sons break the law, but in both black and white communities the oldest male child will of the social predetermination that he must provide what the government doesn't, which leads to the development of a negative social trend in neighborhoods and communities.  One would ask which side of the Aile am I on.  The answer, I am a conservative.  People must remember that 35% of the public lives in poverty and have a school system designed and developed to keep them in that place.  The master planners of these schools (AKA Democrats) benefit from them remaining depended on the Democratic party to fulfill lives needs those continuing the cycle.  This is dangerous as people believe that they are held back and entitled to more.  Those creating a social conditions that could lead to the development of another form of the Nazi party.  That is socially disenfranchised, those enabling them to do things that would seem wrong, but indoctrinated into cult beliefs will justify any act.  Social parties are dangerous and should be joined only to be proactive in the checks and balances of the group|`|DnzL2zWQaa	What?  I'm serious when I advise you to listen to conservative talk radio.  I honestly think you could learn a thing or two.|`|oChTv3k5aa	Satan was the first liberal.|`|Y3gn39ADaa	you worship 0bamer and he worships Hitler and Hitler worshiped the Devil!|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	I know,  Democrats have always been cowards havent they. How sad.
YFzprqqgaa	Yep, I hear you brother/sister, the next question is, what are we going to do about it?  Its evident that voting doesn't help, regardless of the party in power.|`|QFLtTeKEaa	I love the ideals of our founding fathers, but consider that we ARE operating with the political structure that they designed and it has created prosperity.  <br>  <br>  Picture the year 1775, over taxed by England, ruled by a heretitary king and nobles, and no voting rights for anyone who did not own property and not for women and not for non-whites.<br>  <br>  This has been a great system.  If it isn't "for the people anymore," it is because we are not participating.  Get out there.  Make your voice heard.  The leaders are no more special than you.  In this country, the leaders are you.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm part Ojibwe and Assinaboine Sioux and my grandmother was the last speaker of our language in my family.  I know what can be said about this country.  <br>  <br>  However, the principles of our system are sound.  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are fine goals.  All men are created equal is the truth.  The system of checks and balances is brilliant.  <br>  <br>  It's up to us to make it work.|`|dJ1cAGUEaa	Yep. The average American is sick and tired of many things, so maybe we should announce the formation of the the Sick and Tired Party (STP). The goal of the party is to put an end to the things of which we have become sick and tired.|`|AA12295480	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  Yet freedom is taking some of it's biggest hits RIGHT NOW.|`|N6d8tclZaa	Totally agree. It's time to make things right again. But to do this, you either go to war or you start changing it from within. That's how the crooked BAST___S got it to the point that it is. The corruption runs deep and in both parties. I know there are more than just the Dems and Reps, but those two parties constitute the majority of all politics and has the most corruption. Start giving them a little information as to what you think is right. They don't hear enough from the people of the country so they listen to the lobbyists. Let them know in no uncertain terms how you feel about what the news is saying. I'm going to, and I hope 2.2 trillion others do too!|`|fFqzD3aMaa	I couldn't agree more, buy guns.|`|798a7b369cb5d5488af460fb639e81b2aa	Get a life! The constitution has been dead a long time. The best form of enslavement is the illusion of freedom. Go to the movies and be happy.<br>  <br>  What ever you do don't poke a stick at the sleeping dogs in Washington. They will eat your lunch.
KTM5JEkLaa	Yes.  They have an unbelievable pension plan that is given to them for life when they serve two terms.  That's it... two.  This includes a fantastic health insurance plan.  They also continue to vote themselves pay raises every year even though they are inept and public support is next to zero.  Disgraceful.  <br>  <br>  Take into account that the intent of the founders was for House and Senate seats to be secondary to the person's primary occupation.  The reason Congress only meets for specific times was not to provide opportunities for campaigns, fund-raising, or vacations.  It was intended to provide the member to tend to their own business or career while living among their constituents so they could better represent them in Washington.  Now it is a career where re-election at any cost is the name of the game.  Best way to solve this would be a Constitutional amendment establishing term limits.  I also advocate repealing the 17th Amendment and abolishing the IRS in an effort to take back control from the government.

You just gave them an opportunity to talk about how his middle name proves he's a terrorist, and that he was sworn in on the Ko'ran, and that he only won because he was back, and that he's trying to make the country into a Socialist state so we can eventually transition to Marxism, and...<br>  <br>  And what else did Hannity Colms and Rush Limbaugh tell you idiots?

Why not vote for someone that would do good?  Socialism is the opposite of Liberating so where do you get this liberation nonsense?  Is it liberating to take from the working class and give it to the non-working class?  Is that your definition of liberty?<br>  <br>  Socialism has never worked and will never work.  It doesn't work because it centralizes power with a few and destroys the middle class.  It breeds fascism and totalitarianism at the extremes.  Now look at Europe with all their socialism what has it done for those countries?  They are powerless in the world; they can't even protect themselves anymore for foreign invaders.  Once the US becomes just like them who is going to protect us?<br>  <br>  I know liberals want to help people and for everyone to have a chance to do well.  But socialism is not the answer to that.  Liberty and Freedom are the answer to that.  Small government is the answer.  Go study Thomas Jefferson.<br>  <br>  The reason Dr. Mike Savage says liberalism is a physiological disorder is that liberals want one thing and vote against what they want?  This is called illogical at best but at worst it is irrational.  If you believe people should vote in their own best interest a you keep voting against your best interest then that is an example of a physiological disorder. <br>  <br>  So you have two choices.  Go to a therapist or educate yourself.  Start by looking up all the socialist countries that allow freedom and liberty, and enjoy large middle class, that can protect themselves, they are not war mongers, and celebrate innovation.  If you find any countries like that compare them to the USA BO (Before Obama).  I hate to think in the history books we will refer to the United States of America (BO) and the United Socialist States of America (AO).|`|35b8ac78ca5c09c7481fe35c062bdfa0aa	I am a conservative, and I am not against all of his policies.

Definition of liberating: setting free.  As I stated, we are not enslaved, so he is not performing this Godly act of liberation.<br>  <br>  Second, Obama is a socialist my friend.  Definintion of socialism; "Socialism \So"cial*ism\, n. [Cf. F. socialisme.]<br>     A theory or system of social reform which contemplates a<br>     complete reconstruction of society, with a more just and<br>     equitable distribution of property and labor. In popular<br>     usage, the term is often employed to indicate any lawless,<br>     revolutionary social scheme. See Communism, Fourierism,<br>     Saint-Simonianism, forms of socialism."<br>  Joey, Obama CLEARLY said that he supports wealth distribution.  Example of this: Robin hood.  Take from the rich and give to the poor.    See, the problem with that is that rich people own business and provide jobs.  They worked hard for thier money & deserve to keep their profits.  Without the "rich" (which really isn't rich by most standards), we won't have as many jobs, nor as money trickling into the economy.  Further, increasing taxes on those who are truly upper middle class (250K) as well as upper class, is NEVER the solution in a recession.  Once again, this will eventually equate to less money being spent and fewer jobs as business try to scale back to accomodate Obama's tax hike & higher health care costs.  See, Obama gives you a feeling that he is going to make everything better, but fails to provide the details of what it will cost.  Trust me Joey, it will cost a lot.  It will cost low & middle class people jobs & security.  That is the part Obama doesn't want you to know.<br>  <br>  Third, he wants to get rid of Gitmo & wants to withdraw troops from Iraq.  However, he ALSO wants to ADD 17,000 new troops to Afganistan.  Know how much that will cost in terms of national security & taxpayer money?  Well, if you think you know the answer to that question, you don't.  Know why?  Because Obama did an unpresidented thing that NO other president ever did - HE MADE HIS STAFF SIGN CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.  Wait, why would he do that?  TO HIDE the truth.  I have a problem with that - so do Republicans.<br>  <br>  Last, and trust me Joey, I could go on and on and on.  But last, Obama keeps referring to this "debt" that Bush left him.  Only Bush.  That is a blatant lie.  Did Bush leave us in debt?  Yeah, but do you know who created the MAJORITY of the debt?  The DEMOCRATIC congress did - yes, my friend, the very same democratic congress who you see today spending money like it is water.  <br>  <br>  So, when Republicans are against Obama - there is logic and reasoning behind it.  If you do your homework on Obama policies Joey, and I am sure you will come to the same conclusion.|`|U50orfPhaa	Obama is not liberating America, he is controlling it and  appears that communism is coming our way.

JFtpuPrkaa	You're incorrect about that $150,000 figure.  Actually it's $250,000.<br>  <br>  I don't have the 1040 instructions and I'm too lazy to look it up, but I think you're wrong about the tax.  Take a look at the "2008 Tax Rate Schedules".  It usually comes after all the Tax Tables.  Right now I'm looking at the 2005 1040 Instructions so I'll use that as an example:<br>  <br>  According to Schedule Y-1, a married couple filing jointly with a taxable income between $119,950 and $182,800 has to pay $23,317.50 plus 28% of the amount above $119,950.<br>  So $150,000 - 119,950 =  $30,050.  <br>  28% of $30,050 = $8414.<br>  <br>  So, their total tax liablity = $23,317.50 + 8414.00 or $31,731.50<br>  <br>  And we aren't figuring any deductions.<br>  <br>  So, take another look at the 1040 Instructions and re-calculate the amounts.  The mistake you made is that the 28% applies only to the amount over $119,950.  We have a "Progressive Tax System", and that's how the progression works.<br>  <br>  One of the many jobs I've had was as a Tax Preparer.  I may have screwed up the arithmetic, but the concepts are correct.|`|spPD3Mrzaa	I am afraid you may be confused: the tax on 150,000 would be 25, 550 plus 28% of the _difference_ between 131, 450 and 150,000. This is $25,550 + (.28*(150000-131450)). That is 30,744. Not 67,550.

If you are doing research here for an AP paper, expect a "C" Go to the library.<br>  <br>  Second,  Your information is flat wrong. And I will prove it.<br>  <br>  You are using data from the 2008 tax tables (if that's a typo, and you meant 2009, my point stil stands).<br>  <br>  The 2008 instructions/tax tables were set up-and printed--back at the end of 2007. Obama wasn't even elected until last fall. Hispolcies can have no effect on that. The same isture if you meant the tables/instructions for 2009.<br>  <br>  His stimulus package just went into effect. It is not retroactive (with a few exceptions). A new tax instruction book and set of tax tables will be drawn up to reflect the changes in th stimulus plan.<br>  <br>  Oh--BTW--I do think you would get a C, since it's high school. Try it in college and you will get an F. Instructors willling to cut you some slack--like myself--would probably give you a chance to redo the paper.

uAngnN7aaa	depends on where you live.  But one of the first things is to pick a gun.  Below is some information on how to select a handgun for yourself...<br>  <br>  Working on the backside of a counter at a gun store I am constantly being asked "What is the best handgun for self defense?" or "What gun should I buy for concealed/open carry?"<br>  <br>  After a bit of thought I have come to the following simplifications…<br>  <br>  When you are looking for a handgun there are only three things you need to consider:<br>  <br>  Form, Fit and Function<br>  <br>  Form – Do you want a revolver or a semi-automatic.<br>  <br>  Revolver – Low capacity (fewer shots before you need to reload), Low maintenance (fewer parts to break and easier to clean), High reliability (will go bang when you need it).  If you pull the trigger on a revolver and it does not go bang, you just pull the trigger again.  If you pull the trigger on a semi-auto and it does not go bang you have some work to do to put the gun back in an operational state. Some easy, some not, but all take time and you might not have the time available to you at that particular moment<br>  <br>  I used to fix peoples PCs at work and I ran into two mentalities.  The first was "What did I do to break it? What did you do to fix it?  Can you make it bigger? Better?  Faster?  Stronger?  Where is my next software upgrade?  Where is my next hardware upgrade?" and so on…. The other mentality was "I don't care.  Just fix it.  I need it to do my job so make it do what I need it to do.  Don't explain it to me.  I do not care and would not  understand anyway. Just make it work and don't bother me with the details."<br>  <br>  What does this have to do with handgun selection? Well those who have the "bigger better" mentality tend to be males leaning toward a semi-auto. Those who have the "just make it work" mentality tend to be females leaning toward revolvers, but this is true only about 51% of the time.  Just a bit more than half the time and it gives a place to start.<br>  <br>  However, if you are a male that likes revolvers or a female that likes semi-autos don't think yourself odd.  You are in the minority, but not by much.<br>  <br>  Fit – It has to fit in your hand.  It should feel good to hold onto almost as if the grip of the gun was molded just for you.  If it does not, put it back.  Buying it will not make it feel any better.  How many things have you bought in your life that you thought you could use and when you get them home you set them down and never pick them up again because they really don't 'fit' you.  Yet you have your coffee cup, your scissors, your letter opener, your stapler, your chair, your knife, your tools, your pen, your pencil, your car, your room, all because they 'fit' you and all because they fit your life and / or lifestyle. They all feel natural when you use them. They all 'fit.'<br>  <br>  The other main one is sights.  If you can point the gun and have the sights pretty close to being on target then it is probably a good gun for you or at the least deserves some consideration.  On the other hand, if 5 minutes after you picked it up you are still looking for the sites and thinking "well, I know they were on the gun when I saw it on display" then it probably should not deserve any further consideration.<br>  <br>  It needs to fit your budget.  You need a gun that you can not only afford, but can also afford to shoot.  If either the gun or the ammunition for regular practice, typically a monthly trip to the local range, is outside of your budget it is not the gun for you.<br>  <br>  It needs to fit your wardrobe. If you are going to use it for a carry gun, concealed or open, you need to be able to find a usable holster that is consistent with your manner of dress and affords you the most comfortable way to transport what may be a very heavy object while maintaining a good level of accessibility. After all, getting to it is almost as important as being able to use it.  Don't forget to take the long term weight in to consideration. Sometimes a good gun at 7AM can be a boat anchor at 7PM. Multiple holsters for different modes of dress is also an option.  Owning an array of guns is an option as well, but since we are talking budget here I will not go down that rabbit trail.<br>  <br>  It has to fit your lifestyle.  If this is a first gun purchase it is not just a purchase, it is a lifestyle change.  How are you going to store it?  Where are you going to store it?  Who's going to have access to it?  When are they going to have access to it?  Why are they going to have access to it? Are you going to store it loaded?  Are you going to store it unloaded? If you store it unloaded where are you going to put the ammunition in relation to the gun? "Oh look.  Uncle Joe is coming for a visit!" And everybody knows about Uncle Joe.  So now you have to do something different with the gun.  "Oh look. Little Billy is coming to play with little Suzy." What concerns does little Billy bring up?  You know how you have taught little Suzy, but little Billy is an unknown.  Is this cause|`|vriyg1cJaa	Depends on what state you are in. If your state is like Illinois, you need a weapons license or something like that. If your state is like Wisconsin, you walk into a store, say you would like a rifle and after the background check and you pay for it, they give you your gun. Handguns have a 3 day waiting period and a background check in Wisconsin, though.|`|V0rr15amaa	honestly - just go down to your local gun store<br>  <br>  they will be very happy to help you and take your money.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	I have several as I do a lot of hunting.

You are right it is illegal.<br>  <br>  You are not allowed to carry weapons of any sort for self defence in the uk.<br>  <br>  If you are attacked and you pick up a weapon, (say an iron bar) you can use it BUT any force that you use must be proportionate. So for instance if someone was trying to mug you with a knife and you hit them with the bar you picked up that would be proportionate. If they started to run away and you chased them then that would not be proportionate and you could be charged.<br>  <br>  Similarly if you hit them they fell over and you continued hitting them that again would not be proportionate.<br>  <br>  Various offences relating to weapons would be..<br>  <br>  Offensive weapon<br>  Carrying a pointed or sharp bladed item.<br>  Carrying a knife with a blade in excess of 7 inches.<br>  Threatening behaviour.<br>  <br>  If you carried a weapon whilst commiting another offence for example burglary that would be an aggravated offence.

It is also an offence to use more than reasonable force in self-defence.<br>  <br>  If you are carrying a weapon, or an everyday object with then intention of using it as a weapon, it will count against you in determining what is reasonable.<br>  <br>  But if you are attacked you can legally use anything to hand in self defence, provided it is reasonable to do so.|`|pRpgbuqiaa	I don't know what they are, but I assume there must be some.

ibaLRXY2aa	It fits right in with their ridiculous socialist philosophy: take money from the responsible to give to the irresponsible. It goes along with expanded social welfare programs (take from the hard-working taxpayers and give to those too lazy to get a job). They think that everyone should own a house, even if they can't afford it. Well, if they can't afford to own a house, let them rent! I rented for 20 years before I could afford to buy a house. But they don't see it that way. They want everyone to be "equal."<br>  <br>  As a new homeowner, I purchased a house I could afford, took a fixed-rate mortgage, and make my payments on time. Now I'm being told that I need to shell out more of my hard-earned money to bail out those who bought more house than they could afford and can't make the payments, and those who didn't realize that a adjustable rate mortgage was going to adjust UP at some point. The liberals think that this is my "Patriotic duty" and that I should help those more foolish than myself. They want to "spread the wealth" to those who made poor choices.|`|Uaoep16Qaa	because 1. they best way to judge a country is how they treat the poor.<br>  2. id love to see reps taking care of the huge influx of homeless ppl on the street and all the businesses that would go bankrupt because no one can afford to buy their produc, then the glorious free market would fall, they would get scared and ud have to nationalize the banks and corporations again|`|AA10187742	It is the "nanny state" they have grown up to believe in.  Sad, sad, sad.  Those who can't pay, should have never gotten a mortgage to begin with.  I must add, that does not include those that have tragically lost their jobs in this economy.  I remember when one HAD to put at least 20 percent down before even being eligible for any mortgage.
w7X1bLZHaa	Unfortunately it is another law that places emphasis on race, making it a racist law in its own right. If a white person assaults a black person then the charge is assault. But if during the assault the white person calls the black person a racial slur it now becomes a hate crime and carries a more serious penalty. This also applies to black on white crime or any race or what is called a "protected class", which in itself is a form of bigotry. So basically you can assault someone and call them an F..N AS...le and it just be assault. But if you assault someone and call them an F..N ******, Cracker, Jew, ******, or any other word that would show that you possibly assaulted that person based on race, religion, sexual preference, or any other form of bias hatred. Of coarse in court they prosecution would have to prove that you committed the crime based on hate/bias, using a racist slur only provides probable cause to charge the crime, you need a bit more to convict. <br>  <br>  My opinion is that all hate crime laws are a farce. They only reinforce the emphasis on differences and cause emphasis to be placed where it not need be. Racism does not have to be negative for it to exist. Any time race is what you see first than it is racism<br>  <br>  See even this site is biased. It Blocked out the slur for a black person but allowed cracker. It also blocked out the slur for a homosexual. Using the work in a discusion is not racism. That is the problem with this counrty, people act like talking about race is racist.|`|Ut2ouMRKaa	Ok here you go IF you are black or Mexican and you are a salted by a whit guy that is a hate crime If you on the other hand are whit and are a salted by a black or Mexican then it is not a hate crime are we clear now|`|9quzOxZbaa	If you attack them b/c of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion...if you specifically pick someone out b/c of that- it is a hate crime.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	A hate crime is a crime based on bias.<br>  <br>  It's a criminal offense against a person, property, or even a society; motivated by the offender's bias/hate against a victim's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin.<br>  <br>  Obviously, and according to the law, the motive being strictly, "hate," deems the crime more heinous than say for instance, a crime committed in the heat of passion, act of desperation, etc.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	The only difference between a hate crime and a regular one is that the victim is of a different race, gender or sexual orientation from the person that committed the crime against them.  I have no idea why the penalty is greater for these crimes, it doesn't make sense, I guess it's to further discourage discrimination?  It's ironic that hate crime laws discriminate the criminal and the victim themselves.

xmvPyLYUaa	There is no president of Great Britain.  Tony Blair is no longer prime minister.  It is now Gordon Brown.  Brits tend to drink tea like Americans drink coffee, so 5 cups isn't particularly outlandish, but whether the number is correct depends on the reliability of your source.  They speak differently because they are in a different country with a different culture.  It's similar to the way southerners in the States speak differently than New Yorkers.  I don't know and don't care how many people have facial hair.<br>  As far as "how long ago did america let britain become its own country?", I really hope your kidding.  If not, any report you write for tomorrow is going to be lousy.  Start your research with the Colonization of the Americas and the American Revolutionary War (which the English call the American Rebellion).|`|56dbkR4Saa	Okay Well...<br>  1. to Start off there is no President of Britain. All you have is Prime Minister Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth.<br>  2. The Average cup of tea per day per person is between 3 and 4.<br>  3.Moustaches?? Thats a strange question!<br>  4.Britian became independant from America in the 18th century, 1775 - 1783 to be exact.<br>  5.

His name is Gordon Brown.<br>  They do drink tons of tea.  5 cups each sounds about right..<br>  Who is the President? The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the political leader of the United Kingdom and the Head of Her Majesty's Government.<br>  Mustaches, well, you didn't specify men or women.  So I'll include both.  There are about 5 million in total.  <br>  Why do they have weird ways of saying things?  I think we're the ones with the weird accents.  How long ago did America let britain become it's own Country?  OMG how old are you?<br>  Additional advice - you have a computer, obviously, use it to find more information about Great Britain.. you obviously haven't learned anything in school up to now.

Unless your 6 years old then I think you have an excuse..|`|rl1hQAkZaa	Is this a joke or are you really that ignorant?<br>  <br>  We do not have, nor need, or even want, a President.

But hot tea, not the crappy Iced Tea that they have over in the US.<br>  <br>  We have a lot of people here with and without facial hair.. Though how the hell does that make a difference?<br>  <br>  As for the "how long ago did america let britain become its own country?" remark... I really probably shouldn't even dignify that with a remark, but just incase you really do not know.. God knows how.. England was around a LOT longer than America.. Or more, the America you live in. It was discovered not too long ago. America never 'let' UK become its own country, it's always been its own country.<br>  <br>  Lastly, as UK has been around longer than your colony has been in America after ousting the natives, maybe you can explain your 'how come we say things weirdly to you' yourself. If not, I'll put it bluntly.<br>  <br>  We do not say things weirdly or strangely. We say things how it's meant to be said. You speak English, you do not speak american because the american language does not exist. Just as Australia speaks English (because it is English land, if you didn't know this, Australia was originally a prison colony where prisoners were shipped to when the jails were full, the land in essence is still partly owned by the queen). What you speak is your own form of English with its own slang and so on.

There is no President in Britain--not all countries have presidents.   <br>  <br>  British people on average drink more tea than people in the U.S., but not an average of 5 cups.<br>  <br>  They don't have "weird ways" of saying things, just different ways.  Every country has different ways of saying things, even when they speak the same language.  English is different in Canada, the U.S., Britain, India, etc.  Heck, English even changes depending on what part of the U.S. you live in.<br>  <br>  The United Kingdom (which is the correct term to use when referring to the whole country, especially when you are referring to it as a political unit) became a functional poliical unit in 1707.  Its constituent parts (Britain, Scotland, etc.) have been "countries" for hundreds of years before that.  The U.S. became a country in 1776 (or 1781, depending on exactly how you count).  In fact, much of what was the U.S. used to be a part of Britain, not vice versa.

Communism is proudly atheistic and seeks to liberate mankind from superstition and "spiritual bondage." <br>  <br>  Communist Beliefs<br>  <br>  1. I believe there is no God and no knowable providential order, that this physical world is the only reality, physical beings are the only real beings, and reason is man's highest faculty. <br>  <br>  2. I believe religion is "the opiate of the people," an exploiters' tool of oppression that should be eliminated and its resources redirected to improving world conditions to lift mankind from misery. <br>  <br>  3. I believe mysticism and religion are primitive and fraught with error, prejudice and superstition, and that modern science, based on materialism and empirical evidence, is the only respectable avenue to useful knowledge. <br>  <br>  4. I believe that each person has but a single life and that death is final. Therefore, in this life we are to attain all that is deemed worthwhile and express our finer qualities in service to the greater social good. <br>  <br>  5. I believe that as in the case of nature, history evolves in a continuous line from lower to higher forms, from tribalism, feudalism and capitalism to its final maturity in socialism, and that the collapse of capitalism and the establishment of socialism will usher in an age of peace and plenty, when state control will no longer be needed. <br>  <br>  6. I believe that all men are created equal and are inherently good, and that distinctive attitudes, personalities and experiences are determined solely by one's environment; therefore, to uplift mankind, improve the environment. <br>  <br>  7. I believe that the views expressed by our great Marxist revolutionaries represent the one and only correct world outlook, and that it is imperative to overthrow the capitalist regimes, through violent revolution if necessary, to usher in a new order. <br>  <br>  8. I believe that the world's wealth should be shared equally, and that unequal distribution caused by class distinctions, is the root of all social evils, driving men to greed, selfishness and exploitation. Economic necessity is the basic moving force in society. <br>  <br>  9. I believe there is no knowable providential order, that death is permanent, that God does not exist and that the highest life is one of intense consciousness.<br>  <br>  __________________________________<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you really look at what our country is turning into, does it sound familiar to you????

JOXQrsw0aa	OCS is more challenging mentally and physically a candidate is held to a higher standard. The reason it is better should be obvious. The outcome of boot camp is an E-1. The outcome of OCS is an O-1. I don't know many who would choose to be managed(enlisted) rather than being the manager(officer.) Of course there are non-commissioned officers but the highest ranking nco with years of service is outranked by the lowest ranking freshly commissioned officer.  And it isn't as though a guy can easily transition from the enlisted ranks to the officer ranks. In the civilian world it is always possible for anyone within an organization to be appointed an executive on a moments notice regardless of specific qualifications. In the military there is a wall between management and the managed that has definite obstacles that must be overcome in a very limited time or it will never happen and an enlisted service member  will forever be in the enlisted ranks. In general, he must obtain a college degree and commission by the age of 30. With commissioning programs that allow an enlisted member to transition to the officer ranks by attending college full time, he must have been in the top 50% of his high school class, and he must be approved for the program by the age of 26. <br>  To see the difference in lifestyles between the officer and enlisted ranks compare the  regular military compensation for various ranks and locations at the following link. Location makes a significant difference due to the housing allowance(BAH.) Lower ranking young single enlisted service members live in the barracks and do not collect BAH. <br>  <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/militarypay/mpcalcs/Calculators/RMC.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenselink.mil/militarypay/m...</a><br>  2nd Lt( Army, Air Force and Marines) = Ensign(Navy) = O-1.<br>  1st Lt( Army, Air Force and Marines) = Lt JG(Navy) = O-2.<br>  Captain( Army, Air Force and Marines)= Lt(Navy) = O-3.<br>  Advancement  to O-2  by about the  18th month.<br>  Advancement to O-3 by about 39th month|`|UQYurvnYaa	i'd say Marine OCS is harder|`|E4jwk6r0aa	Well If you got a shot at OCS before marine boot, and that is possible than they are two different worlds, except for the disipline involved, We are talking about Quantico, there are many phases of training going on there.

If you have a 4 yr degree, you simply talk to the OSO (officer slection officer), submit your package for commission and then attend OCS and after you attend The Basic School an officer molding program, you do not ever have to go to basic recruit training.

If so, they were more than justified in contacting your other employer for the purpose of ensuring that you did not violate the terms of those agreements.  <br>  <br>  Past that, I'm not sure if its actionable.  The problem is that you already had the job and that the information she passed on was all true.  You don't like it because it puts you in a bad light, but there's nothing incorrect about what she said.  And so long as you have not lost your job as a result, I just don't see a cause of action that makes sense.|`|AyRkltXzaa	That is in fact a violation and very unprofessional from the administrator. Either the administrator that phoned your boss didn't like you at all or was thinking he or she was doing the right thing, but I am more convinced for the first one.

GPZUfFZ1aa	Yes.  China is the only nation I can think of that has actually eradicated their own culture during a revolution.  Sure, cultures have been destroyed before, but never on the scale, or with the conscious purpose that happened in China during their 'cultural revolution'.  Academics were culled, and ancient works of art were destroyed, as well and priceless religious artifacts.  No other nation has ever tried to ruin their own culture in such a way.  Not even Russia under the Bolsheviks.  While most Chinese people are apparently lovely and very calm and peaceful, I believe China is a mad beast.  They harvest organs from practitioners of Falun Gong.  They support the North Koreans.  They force abortion upon people.  They torture people.  They worship an insane meglomanic chairman as a deity.  In my opinion, they have to go.  Not all of them, or even most of them.  But their brutal society has to be extinguished.<br>  <br>  Please not I am not racist or anything, but the Chinese government is giving the Third Reich a run for it's money.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	loves christmas gifts is right. The only thing -STUNNING- is how many people actually send $500,000 to the people in Nigeria even though it is soo well known. There at least 3 different versions of the 529 scam, and whoever would send money to an e-mail with bad spelling from a spoofed account of an English name just wants to do it, no questions asked, it makes the feel empowered...<br>  <br>  The biggest threat to the civilized world is still nukes. All that crap about handguns is baseless, because you can get one if you want to avoid gang violence from happening to you. In certain cities, Gangs, not weapons, are the issue and nobody wants to confront it because it is too difficult and many police dont want to confront gang members, due to what can happen after the arrest and the officer goes home to family in their house. Gamgs are no joke, if you are in the right spot. The naive people get targeted, then they see. Strength is not Strength against 5 people in a dark alley, where nobody can see or hear you, or would stop if they did. There it is.<br>  <br>  If a nuke is launched, and it could come from anywhere, go to a church and stay there because in a month, we will all be dead.

tdIuoIc1aa	yes they can. If you don't pay a note, most contracts allow a bank to freeze or automatically withdraw the funds from the account. No court order is required - those are for when other agencies want to freeze your accounts. Best thing to do is open another account with another bank and forget about those funds. you may be able to file bankruptcy and obtain some relief but, that costs a bit of money too. no easy way around it|`|OiAl6w48aa	They most certainly can freeze his account.  Whether or not they can successfully claim all the money in it is another story.  However they are under no obligation to continue to provide him with an account.  And the bank is correct, any loan he accepted through the credit union would almost certainly have a provision to allow them to take money directly from his account if he fails to pay in accordance with the terms of the note.|`|htSZsds7aa	I would look into that, and read his papers. I dont think anyone can hold your retirement or disability money.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	It's called a "setoff," and yes, if he owes money to the credit union the loan documents probably did state that they can exercise a right of setoff against any accounts he has there.

But students arent suppose to be showing affection with each other at school. So there isnt even a case , really.|`|otYOxmnuaa	I imagine showing affection in any sort is against the rules while on campus as it's a distraction to other students and quite distasteful if you ask me.<br>  <br>  That being said, if he's only targeting the gay couple and not the hetero couples, then yes -- he's teetering on an edge of cliff he doesn't want to fall off of...but inches closer every time he singles them out.<br>  <br>  I'd go talk to him and/or his superiors and let them know -- they'd rather nip it in the bud in-house rather than have to deal w/ frivolous litigation.  <br>  <br>  Do what you think is right.|`|AA12176505	It is unfair, but I don't think that it is illegal.

So it's kind of up to their discretion. Also, it specifically states that there shall be no discrimination for ethnicity, income level, and some other crap, but it doesn't mention gay rights. However, it's not like your high school's rules have final say. The supreme court does. (wh-hooh, America!!!!) So at least do something for these poor, oppressed gays!

It's more an internal district policy/disciplinary case.|`|bkWENLpeaa	That's discrimination, probably not illegal though. I imagine if local newspapers found out it could create a fuss?

esOaJoqBaa	It means that the unit is short on men. They may transfer them from other units, or get marines fresh from MOS school. They must have certain numbers in order to leave. If they cannot replace the guys that are getting out soon, then they will take them on deployment. If they can fill all the spots they need beforehand, then he will probably not be needed. Just from this it does not sound like they will try to keep him beyond his EAS. They may just deploy him for a while before shipping him home.<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  If he is supposed to get out the month that the unit leaves it means one of two things. Either he is staying around to help train them as best he can until they deploy, or he is going to have to deploy with them. If there is a chance he is going to get stop lossed you may want to consider voluntarily extending for a year or so. That way he will get paid extra. <br>  If they can fill all the spots they need to, then they will task him out to do something else and not deploy him.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Colin has it close-they are keeping him in the unit so that he can help with new people as they join; if he has been told he will still get out on his EAS then they do not plan to stop=loss or extend him but just keep him in the unit.  Typically they transfer people too short to deploy out of the units and get the unit up to strength with the people going, units have to maintain a certain 'readiness level" prior to deployment and that has requirements for manning so they are holding him waiting for his replacement to come in to the unit.  This is typically a "shortage of new people" time as the recruit training usually takes a break around Christmas, most want to be graduate or not go until after Christmas so they are home.  The Marines also made some training changes that I think hung some up for a while but the new people should be showing up soon.  The Marine Corps made recruiting goals and their is not a shortage just a Burp from training schedules.
AA10709853	the military doesn't care one little bit about your personal life.  If it is meant to be..she will still be there when you are discharged.  <br>  <br>  you will be assigned to whatever unit they decide to send you to..and you may or may not deploy immediately..or at all.|`|cEFiOrX5aa	If she likes you she will wait for you.<br>  <br>  The first poster is absolutely correct... the Army does not care one bit about your personal life (so long as it doesn't involve felonies or drug use) and will deploy or not deploy you at their will.

mzk0t6Ovaa	Look at it this way. . . An OTH in lieu of court-martial is not a<br>  discharge that is directed, it's one that's requested.  As you asked<br>  for and were granted an OTH in lieu of going to trial and facing a<br>  possible punitive discharge (i.e., BCD or DD), you're likely not going<br>  to be able to get it upgraded.  It's all about the decision to request<br>  the OTH or risk a punitive discharge at trial.<br>  <br>  If you feel that the discharge was issued as a result of an error in<br>  process or law, then you can always petition your Service's BCMR.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	The way that you described it, sounds like a righteous characterization.

No asian auto makers manufacturing in the US are asking for bailouts.  They don't pay their workers ridiculous wages.  They don't provide $100,000 pensions and other perks.  They don't pay workers not actually working because of slow business, just to keep them handy for when things pick up.  And generally they don't pay their CEO's horrifically large salaries and bonuses even when they do a lousy job.<br>  <br>  The excuse that the failure of auto-makers would drastically hurt the economy and put tens of thousands out of work is not valid either.<br>  <br>  Many enormous companies, including airlines, have filed bankruptcy and then reorganized to come back as leaner and more efficient companies.<br>  <br>  The objective of huge bail-outs is, on the part of the auto-makers, for those fat-cats in charge to keep the status quo regardless of their incompetence, and on the part of the govt., a massive power grab to keep the country's progression to marxism, which Obama has fast-tracked, steaming along as they'd like.|`|0xp9Oobnaa	it's because they want to to be American style.

Like any citizen they have the right to make a citizens arrest if they are witness to a crime and "arrest" your movement until proper authorities arrive. That is the extent of their rights. You may be stopped and they may ask to search you but if you refuse to cooperate their only legal recourse is to hold you until the police arrive.  The police may of course search if they have reasonable suspicion that a crime has occurred. <br>  Now don't get too angry with the security guard.  It is doubtful that he knows exactly what his actual rights are.  He was trained to search you so he did.  The reason is actually for your convenience.  If he simply held you then you would have to wait on the police and it would take longer.  But he is supposed to ask and you have a right to refuse. He is also not supposed to do that sort of thing in public.  That is what offices are for.  Citizens don't have the right to go about searching each other and in the final analysis a security guard is just a citizen the same as you.<br>  <br>  Added:  After looking up Asda I see it is a British subsidiary of WalMart.

m5J36D28aa	I was in 301x4, Airborne Inertial and Radar Navigation Systems Repairman.  The tech school was 12 months long.  The 3 remaining years were spent repairing those systems and a few more on B-52, KC-135, AC-119K, RB-66, RF-4C, F-4D, F-4E, RB-57 aircraft at bases from Maine, to South Carolina, to Vietnam, to Japan.  Additional radar courses were taught at almost each base I was at.<br>  The day would be receiving write ups from debriefing and going out to the aircraft to repair the problem.  Sometimes we would pull the black boxes back to the shop and repair them there.  Or order a part against that unit and take out a fresh unit to the aircraft.  I specialized in the inertial nav system and stayed in the shop most of the time.  I specialized on Doppler radar nav at bases that only had that.

6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Yes, it's possible, unlikely, but possible.  The Navy is downsizing and has become VERY selective.<br>  <br>  You need to speak with a Navy Officer Recruiter.  The Navy uses special Officer Recruiters to recruit Officers.  These are NOT the guys you see working recruiting stations in places like the mall.<br>  <br>  You can call a regular recruiting office and get the phone number to contact the Officer Recruiter who has responsibility for your area.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to enlist with a degree?  If the Navy will not offer you a commission then try the Army.  The life of an Officer is far, far, far superior to that of an enlisted.|`|2fd55f14f3a0438dea1a8b90b1409e79aa	I would try talking to the recruiter about going OCS, and possibly getting into public affairs, who knows maybe developing a US Navy version of a video game simulation that the US Army uses for  training.....|`|cEFiOrX5aa	The most Navy Officer recruiting I have seen so far has been at the Maritime Colleges across the nation. They were practically on their hands and knees at one east coast Maritime College begging the recent graduates to consider the direct commission program. <br>  <br>  This surprises me, since the Navy doesn't have too much of a need for expert boat handlers, especially not officers since most (if not all) small vessel operations in the Navy are handled by senior ranking Petty Officers or Chiefs.
uIAHkm0Naa	if no cop was there then how can they know it was you driving the car? if your buddy is smart he will say he was driving so his insurance will cover it and you wont be in jail DUH|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	There are many charges that could be filed in this case.  I don't think that any of them will lead to jail time.<br>  <br>  The investigation might uncover proof that you were the driver.  If that proof is strong enough you can be charged.  The most likely charges would be Driving without a license, leaving the scene of a property damage accident, and failure to report a property damage accident.<br>  <br>  Conviction on these charges usually results in fines and loss of driving privileges (even though you don't have a license yet, your driving privileges can be suspended, the suspension would start as soon as you would otherwise qualify for a license).  The big problem for you and your friend is that his insurance does not have to cover the damages because an unlicensed driver was at the wheel.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you know this now ... but you should not have been driving without a valid license!|`|2eVLgyToaa	ok my dad is a detective so i would like to know the state this occurred in. you may be charged being there were no cops present depending on what state. The most you face is paying for the car or having your insurance cover it. paying for it is going to be a hard one you might need a loan and im not sure if ur liable. I think you should do at least 20 hours of community  service cause you sound like a smart kid but made a bad choice and if u fail to pay the fine u spend time in a holding cell which is different from jail<br>  P.S. NEXT TIME YOUR FIEND ASKS YOU TO DO SOMETHING WITHOUT A LICENSE TELL HIM NO.
dVQdswtTaa	It is not unusual to see a military helicopter almost anywhere. <br>  <br>  There doesn't have to be a big military base near you, there may be an Army National Guard unit some where around there. <br>  <br>  I doubt there is any sinister explanation for it. It was probably a training flight or something similar.|`|AA11858035	I wouldn't worry about it, military air traffic is getting more common everyday, I see at least one flying over Houston almost daily, and Florida does have a lot of military presence, it might have just been on it's way from one base to another. They do do that.|`|Lh4S3q53aa	There are military bases all over the US.  Including Florida.  =)  <br>  I work for Sikorsky Helicopters and there are test flights all day of all kinds of helicopters from commercial to military.  We actually build the black hawks!   This is certainly normal.  Those helicopters have to get around somehow.

Not a bad job of ID though as the only way to tell the normal cargo versions(of similar production/model generations) apart at a distance is the markings. As for why they were there, most likely they were just transiting the area while going from one base to another. They could even have just been logging stick time for proficiency. We have a couple of large army bases down in Florida & the Chinook is the premier heavy lifter for the Army. Our local airport gets lots of traffic from the various military reserve units around the NW just to do touch & goes and the like for practice/training. Lots of EA-6s, P-3s, C-130s and C-17s. We even see F-15s and F/A-18s occasionally.<br>  <br>  I have to thank God that the Congress and the Army were smart enough to decide to buy new ones. My buddy was in Afghanistan and his unit was flying upgraded C models and at high altitudes they still out lifted and out ran every other helo type they worked with. So funny to hear about blackhawk drivers asking the chinooks to slow down.  New production models with even better engines and avionics will be among the(if not THE) best in the world. Now if we could just spend our purchasing budget that effectively through the rest of the military.|`|DLmWSBHbaa	More likely it was a navy or coast guard ch 46 involved in the search for those missing football players.  The only real visible difference between a ch 46 and ch 47 is that the 46 only has one landing gear in front, while the 47 has two.  Also, the Army uses 47's while the navy, marine corps and coast guard use the 46.  It would be very typical to see this chopper involved in search and rescue operations.

8dc5NMexaa	In this 6 to 3 decision, Justice Stevens who wrote the majority opinion stated that there could be circumstances where consumer lawsuits would not be allowed, including if the FDA had considered and rejected a stronger warning label. So even the majority of the justices made a narrow call in this case, and it did not block the state tort suit because the FDA’s labeling of the risks of administration of Phenergan did not consider the warning of one of the manners of administration, i.e. IV-push method vs. IV-drip method; the former being dangerous because of Phenergan’s mixture with arterial blood that could cause gangrene and amputation.  The staff at the hospital administered the Phenergan by IV-push method that was to have been in the arm’s vein, but apparently missed and was mixed into arterial blood.  So as I read the case, it turns not necessarily on the loss of arm, but on whether the FDA considered the IV-push method when they decided on the warning label that Wyeth (maker of Phenergan) would have to place on their medicine.  The Court rules that they didn’t, and therefore the federal regulation that would have pre-empted the state tort lawsuit did not apply.  The court did not say that future cases would not be pre-empted regardless of the horrendous injuries that may accompany them.  So it was the facts of FDA’s consideration, and not the injury.  It may   be a very narrowly drawn opinion, and it does not limit the federal regulations pre-emption doctrines from being applied in state tort cases.  But it does state that there may be circumstances in each case why the pre-exemption does not apply.  As to the three justices mentioned, you know that they keep the reins tight, and really, so did Stevens in the majority by not ruling that federal pre-exemption by FDA would no longer be applied.  He expressly said the opposite.|`|Vanf51Pzaa	Sometimes judges' decisions can seem very odd.  There was one not long ago in a NY City court where a judge confirmed an election process that was clearly designed to unfairly favour certain candidates.  <br>  <br>  But you should understand that judges must not make the law - they should only interpret existing laws.  They must not 'rule from the bench'.  So, when the law is idiotic, their decisions will seem idiotic.  In the NYC example, the court in that case said that they had to rule that the law had been interpreted correctly but that the law should be changed.<br>  <br>  What the judges were saying in your ruling is that it is the job of the FDA, not the court, to decide whether a particular drug is safe. <br>  <br>  If the court had allowed a jury to make a labeling determination, it would have effectively taken the FDA's responsibility away from them.  If you are going to do that, then don't have an FDA in the first place.  <br>  <br>  But I would very much doubt whether a jury could have made a proper determination in any case unless they were all pharmacists or doctors.

I think the western world has been fooled into thinking that the corporation is the means to all ends. Most people do not know how corporations actually work. They were created by wealthy ship owners in the 1700s. Before corporations, ship owners were responsible for the cargoes of their ships. So if a ship sunk, or was taken by pirates, the owners had to cover the costs of the cargo that had been lost. So, they incorporated themselves. What that meant was, if a ship was lost, the owner of the cargo would front up to the ship owner and say. You owe me, the ship owner would say, no I don't, it's the corporation that owes you, and it is broke. Sorry, you lose. Corporations distance the share holders from the responsibilty or cost of the damages done by the corporation. And so insurance companies were created, and they also were incorporated, adding to the problem. As time went by more and more rights were accorded to corporations. Today, they have all the rights of humanity. I say, take these rights away, and hold the shareholders, and directors of corporations responsible for their actions. A corporation is much more than human. For one thing, they are potentially imortal, and they can be in more than one place at the same time. If the shareholders and directors were held responsible, then the stock market would reflect this. Environmental, and socially irresponsible companies would lose value in the market. Likewise, responsible companies would flourish. So if a company caused $100,000,000.00 damage to the environment, and they had 1,000,000. shareholders, then each shareholder would have to pony up $100.00 to cover the cost of the damage. Would you invest your hard earned money into a company that pollutes, or was socially irresponsible with it's workers entitlements? No, of course you wouldn't, because you may be liable to pay the damage. What you would do, is invest in good companies with proven environtmenal, and social records. The whole world would benefit. Not just the very wealthy. Socialism isn't about looking after the little bloke, and it's not about being forced to slave your fingers to the bone. Socialism is about giving every one a fair share. Some of you say that america was built on freedom. Freedom to do what? drive your workers into the ground. Take away their human rights? Freedom to enslave them. Freedom to die, because they cannot afford to see a doctor. I disagree with your american slavery/freedom. Socialism is not Comunism. Capitalism has failed. Socialism is the only hope for humanity.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	It's funny why there is a debate about why americans hate socialism. Here are the facts why. 1) Ask anyone who lived in East Germany (a self-declared Socialist State) why they were trying to get over the Berlin wall into East Germany. 2) There have been as many as 28 former socialist countries, now there are only 5 ( China, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea and Laos). Finally look at the countries we have notoriously had problems with: North Korea, Soviet Union, East Germany, Cuba, Somalia.... have been or are currently SOCIALIST. Coincidence? To anyone who thinks I am talking about communisim, not socialism, socialisim is the step before communisim and these countries describe themselves as being socialists.|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	Because socialism has been, for the last 90 years or so, been consistently described in the U.S. education system, government, and media as an enemy.  Most people in the U.S. don't even understand what socialism is--as the answers above show.  They think socialism means less freedom, when in fact socialism has nothing to do with personal freedoms.  They think socialism = Russia and China, and all their associated evils, when in fact those were totalitarian countries.  Many peope in the U.S. actually support socialist ideas, like Medicare/Medicaid, accessible health care, unemployment insurance, etc., not realizing that these are socialist ideas.|`|pAYzU2ykaa	1) I'm a little guy and I helped myself.  2) If the 'greedy boss' has to pay an extra 10% in taxes because he is making money, which of the little guys should he fire so he can keep his company alive?  3)  Greedy bosses pay what people are worth in the market.  It can't be blamed on anyone if 'the little guy' working for the greedy boss isn't worth much.  And if the little guy isn't worth much, maybe he should consider taking up another line of work, going to school, or moving to another country where people with his skills are paid more.|`|0gn8VI2aaa	It is human nature to want more, so making every one "equal" would hurt everyone.

It's about drudgery. It's saying " The government knows how to spend my money better then I do. It's a governments attempt to force equality. People will have different outcomes in life, And those different outcomes have nothing to do with the big guy taking from the little guy, <br>  <br>  They have to do with some people working harder, Some not, Some people making wise choices , While others make foolish choices.  The problem is, You have been brain washed by the liberals, And they have brainwashed you into believing that all people who are rich and produce, Are evil and keeping the little guy down, Which nothing could be further from the truth . This is all coming from a guy who doesn't have a penny to his name, And even in spite of that, I would not want any other system then American capitalism, Where I have the hope of one day building a future that is determined by my own choices and hard work, And not the government or someone else hard work. God bless.|`|mREADGwZaa	America was built around freedom. It was built to provide an alternative to the repressive, intrusive regime of Great Britain.<br>  <br>  Socialism is undoubtedly an infringement of freedom. The ability to own one's own property is an integral component of freedom. Socialism encroaches on this right, essentially establishing a system of "legal plunder" where the government steals wealth from its citizens and determines how to use it, usually for its own benefit. <br>  <br>  I would fight for freedom even if it wasn't the most effective economically, but fortunately it is. Socialism kills economic initiative, because logically, no one wants to work when they can't keep the products of their labor. Throughout history, capitalism has proven to be the most effective economic system. Just look at the top economic powers. The United States has been economically dominant for years, and it's no coincidence that it also has one of the most free economies. The People's Republic of China's economy exploded when it turned to capitalism. Surely this can't be a coincidence?|`|xeFwOpjQaa	OK, here is the thing.<br>  <br>  I know MANY people that would LOVE Socialism, but they also understand that a functioning socialism in the scale of our country is TOTALLY not feasible.<br>  <br>  There are way to many people with different beliefs, and some people still enjoy working for living rather than accepting universal healthcare and the likes.<br>  <br>  Also, I agree with Sunstarr above me.<br>  <br>  One final edit point, People come to America becuase we are Capitalist, and they can get ahead, not be like "everyone else".<br>  <br>  Who's responsibility is it to make yourself "equal"?

If at any point you decide you don't want to be an AET you can choose to put your name on another A school waiting list or in some cases you can strike the rate.

In our view, neither the possession of guns nor the regulation of guns raises a civil liberties issue."<br>  <br>  Richard<br>  <br>  Here is the ACLU's position statement....<br>  <br>  The Second Amendment provides: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."<br>  <br>  ACLU POSITION <br>  Given the reference to "a well regulated Militia" and "the security of a free State," the ACLU has long taken the position that the Second Amendment protects a collective right rather than an individual right. For seven decades, the Supreme Court's 1939 decision in United States v. Miller was widely understood to have endorsed that view.<br>  <br>  The Supreme Court has now ruled otherwise. In striking down Washington D.C.'s handgun ban by a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in D.C. v. Heller held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms, whether or not associated with a state militia.<br>  <br>  The ACLU disagrees with the Supreme Court's conclusion about the nature of the right protected by the Second Amendment. We do not, however, take a position on gun control itself.

What is stopping you?  I guess what is really bizarre about your question is you think loans are fine, just not the interest.  Everyone agrees interest rates that are too high should be banned, but not all interest.  And since the bank borrows your money when you deposit it, that interest should go away too, since you are charging the bank that amount.<br>  <br>  I thought at first you were just kidding.

Judging by the answers to this question I would say that these changes will be extremely unpopular. <br>  Usury was forbidden by early Christians and still is by Muslims. Judaism forbade the charge of interest between the Jews, but interest could be charged on loans to Gentiles. This gave the followers of Judaism a very unfair advantage over Christians and Muslims. So the Christian church had to drop its objection to usury, as banking was  becoming dominated by the Jews. And this is where we are today.<br>  If interest rates are not charged then the only way of making money out of capital will be through share ownership in a business. This already happens but people borrow the money to buy the shares, so the profits have to be higher in order to compensate for the interest charged by the bank on that investment. So prices may drop if no interest is charged. Or wages would have to rise so that people can afford to buy the products they produce. Major purchases such as houses would have to be arranged through government loans, according to housing need. We shall need honest politicians!<br>  <br>  It will never happen, as the market is illogical. In the 80"s robots replaced factory workers, but robots do not buy cars nor eat cereals, or chocolate. It is that suspect logic that brought the system down.|`|sfjMv6bdaa	Yeah, imagine a world without massive debt, people being given a fair amount of money to pay back in a fair amount of time.<br>  You can make money off of loans in other ways...|`|MEReSvZeaa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  Providing loans is a service.

AA12174773	If I remember correctly from political science class, party practice is a concept most political scientists would use to apply to governmental actions which are neither enumerated by law nor traditional to that nation.  Party practice in a parliamentary government can become very strong if the party in power does not change, but frequent changes of government tend to erase any damage from bad party policy in most cases.  You rarely hear this term in the American two party context, but that does not mean it does not exist there.

Their qualification for getting to vote on the laws of the country is that they were born. <br>  - The CoE bishops, who despite representing a particular denomination of the church whose membership constitutes around 1% of the population have the right to frustrate the will of the rest of the population.<br>  - The life peers appointed at the whim of the prime minister of the day<br>  <br>  What about royal prerogative and the residual powers of the monarchy? They aren't as cuddly or benign as they sound.  Effectively, they allow the government to do what they like without answering to our elected representatives in the commons.<br>  <br>  For the example, the government used Royal Prerogative to declare war on Iraq without a vote in parliament.  That is, because the Queen declares war on a country using royal prerogative (on "advice"* of her ministers), the government circumvents the need for a vote in parliament.  <br>  <br>  Although the Queen could technically refuse, such refusal would be likely to trigger a constitutional crisis on a scale not seen for 150 years, and show how flimsy the country's present "constitution" is i.e. it works to a large degree through tradition and unwritten protocols.<br>  <br>  *Read "advice" as the government tells her to do it.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	I'm not a brit, but am familiar with your politics.<br>  <br>  I've always wondered why you stuck with the parliamentary system? It's only limited democracy at best... now not that we're perfect across the pond by any means, but at least we give everyone a shot to get represented for the most part. Every region, state, district... and they all share relatively equal power at nearly all levels of government excepting the executive.<br>  <br>  Also, your prime misinsiter should be held accountable to the people. Its not right the house of lords and commons holds so much sway over him and his decisions. The people should fully elect him and he should be held fully accountable to the people, not the legislature. Excepting illegal behavior of course.<br>  <br>  You should also take a look at our primary system too, it would feel less rigged then what you currently have. Although it always feels a bit rigged I'm afraid... to some extent. There is money involved after all.<br>  <br>  But your legislative problems (legacies? appointments? limited monarch control?) are really the heart of the issue. Our congress sucks, but at least one Lord cant gum up the works like one over there can if you know what I mean. Filibuster or not.<br>  <br>  Just a thought man. It's not all bad though, you guys do pretty well for a country with a remaining land-owning monarchy... its just hard to break tradition and I know some aren't too keen on relinquishing their grip on power.

CowgOqXTaa	The Mexican border authorities do not check criminal background when crossing from the USA into Mexico the way that Canada does. <br>  <br>  However, it is illegal to enter Mexico without a waiver from the Justice Ministry if you have a felony conviction. *IF* for any reason, she were to get involved with the cops while in Mexico and they checked her record, she might be in trouble.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|J6JFiNL8aa	when you say she has a felony do you mean a warrant is out for her arrest?? If shes already paid her dues then she has nothing to worry about....if there is a warrant then they will catch her
2zym4J9xaa	Yes!  You will either need 15 extra college credits... or they will want you to score at least a 50 on the ASVAB.  <br>  <br>  You can be a SEAL.  Get the SEAL Challenge contract in the Navy.  If you don't make it you will probably end up doing whatever the Navy wants you to... and that will probably be on a ship, and probably a job you don't want.<br>  <br>  Unless you know you can pass BUDs... you might want to try Army 18x Special Forces, or 11X option 40 Ranger, or even go Marine infantry and try to go to Special Ops from there... either Marine Recon, Marine Force Recon or you can be a SEAL from the Marines... The Marine Corps is part of the Navy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Remember all things come to an end.
esOaJoqBaa	The GI Bill will pay you when you go to school. That is it. If you go to college or a trade school they will pay you a certain amount each month to cover your costs. If you do not go then you don't get any money.<br>  The 20k bonus is yours either way though and should not be tied to school.<br>  There are different types of GI Bill. There is one type that they are giving you, it covers college and many trade schools as well. With that one they pay you a set rate depending on how many credits you take. The new GI Bill that begins this August works by paying for your school entirely as well as paying for your books and housing as well if you are at least a 1/2 time student..
9tcv3TiWaa	1) Normally 6 months, but he can be on IA - Individual Augmentte for up to 12 months or even unaccompanied orders OCONUS for up to 2 years.   If he is on a ship then count on him being gone 85% of the year because they will be gone for days, weeks and months at a time. <br>  <br>  2) If he is stationed at a base on accompanied orders (meaning dependents are authorized) and you live in housing you can remain there while he is gone, you do not have to leave.  If you live outside of housing on your own (ie mortgage, rental) then you still receive BAH (Housing allowance) based on the command's zip code.    If he gets IA orders or PCS orders then you cannot stay in housing, you must move out of housing.  You can stay in the community if you wish and get a rental.<br>  <br>  3) Communications will be limited to letters, emails and phone calls.  Usually phone calls are only when in port.  Emails can be turned off or out at anytime, usually quick response but they also can be screened by the command and if something is said they will cease to be allowed.  Letters depends on the command he is with to how quickly they are received.  <br>  <br>  4) 8 weeks long, then he will have to do A School (training) and that can be up to 2 years in length depending on what he is doing.   Unless A School is longer than 26 weeks you will not allowed to be together.  During Boot Camp and A School (if on unaccompanied orders) then he will get BAH based on his Home of Record (HOR - where he enlisted) zip code included with his Base Pay.  With the Navy it can take up to 6 weeks before the first pay is issued but it will be backdated to the date he started.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	1. In the Navy the longest is 6months, more likely 3<br>  <br>  2. you do whatever you do, nothing happens to you.....?<br>  <br>  3. Most times not, depends on his MOS and where he is stationed<br>  <br>  4.for the Navy it's like 8 weeks, not  a big deal trust me<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  USMC 68 Vietnam|`|zGVVxuFLaa	1.  A "usual" Navy deployment is 6-7 months.  There is also lots of time away before the deployment for training.  The entire pre-deployment training period is called "work-ups" and many spouses find the home again, gone again part harder than the actual deployment.  Also, many Navy personnel are doing longer tours right now, usually in the 12-13 month range.<br>  <br>  2.  He will continue to receive BAH and be eligible for base housing while deployed.  Many families find base housing a good place to be during deployment because their neighbors understand deployment.<br>  <br>  3.  Depending on your husband's deployment location, you may (or may not) be able to communicate via telephone, email, IM, skype, webcams or just good old fashioned mail.<br>  <br>  4.  I don't know.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  Military life can be hard but it has many rewards as well.|`|AA11349832	1. maybe from 9 months to a year depending on the situation<br>  <br>  2. depending on his rank you recieve extra bay when deployed besides other extras bah (basic alowancee for housing, if he lives with you)<br>  <br>  3.yes there are telefones on ships and by usps<br>  <br>  4.8 weeks|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	tell him to go army or marines, save him some ridicule.

62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	how long has the father been in in USA? <br>  if its more than 6 months then he is ILLEGAL. <br>  USA will not accept any change of status for him while he is illegal and still in USA. <br>  the father needs to go back to Canada while the son applies.
rNXCnJ8Eaa	I won't be as harsh as some of the others on here.<br>  <br>  Most people will tell you that the military was their calling, or at least that's what it should be. Obviously desperate times call for desperate measures (such as a declining economy) but if you're not entirely sure that military life is in your blood, then don't pursue it.<br>  <br>  Military life is very stressful and will strain your marriage. As long as your wife is on board with what you're prepared to do, then why not go for it?|`|9tcv3TiWaa	Boost in pay?  Not necessarily your income will only start at $1290 a month, maybe more and that is before deductions.  You could enter as an E3 because you have college credits but even that can be very difficult to raise a family on.<br>  <br>  GI Bill you can't use right away, you use Tuition Assistance and that has limits of $4500 per year or 16 credits.  Plus if you are on a ship you might not always be able to do college classes as you still have quite a bit to do in qualifications before you will have lots of spare time.  <br>  <br>  Housing you can get into it or get a housing allowance and as long as you live within your budget you can do alright but you do have to be cautious.  And housing sometimes can have a waiting list of up to 18 months.  <br>  <br>  MC rating is hard to get into, you also have to look at other areas if you can't get into it.  You have to get a decent score on the ASVAB as well to even be considered.  <br>  <br>  Family time just consider being away from them about 85% of the year, that you will miss birthdays, anniversaries, first days at school, first tooth lost, parent/teacher interviews, etc....  You will not have much communication it can be limited to emails (which can be read) or phone calls when in port.  Plus as a MC you can go just about anywhere so you can be in the middle of it all not necessarily just on a ship.|`|R0Mgjkgzaa	Hi<br>  I had friends that are in the service. I'm 25 now but when I was in H.S. they joined the National Guard and trained on weekends throughout the school year and summer and some now are done with National guards and college and some are still in there overseas. and not even thought of college yet. So, It's quite a commitment and lots of time away from loved ones., The majority of my friends that have done what your intrested in just got done a yr or 2 ago so about5+ yrs.|`|lkxFy681aa	Onnce you've finished training, you're basically being paid for free.<br>  <br>  The navy are very rarely needed.<br>  Haave you heard reports of anyone firing missiles at each other's ships lately?

Probably not.<br>  <br>  It's great pay, something for your kid to boast about when he's older, and you get free healthcare.<br>  What's not to like?|`|mCbChkKraa	Joining the Navy would separate you from your family. I wouldn' t do it.|`|2fd55f14f3a0438dea1a8b90b1409e79aa	you can expect  at least 6 to 8 months deployed when stationed onboard ship.....<br>  <br>  different ratings have different sea / shore rotation schedules...<br>  <br>  try going to the ymca for swimming classes, because in a worst case scenario......you better know how to swim <br>  <br>  boot camp =  eight weeks of mind games, the first two weeks, count on hitting the rack at 9 pm and getting up at 2 am....<br>  the first thing you will be trusted with is folding your skivvies right, don't laugh, you will be up at 3 am folding them  with someone yelling in your face....|`|nh5FNLwUaa	You don't necessarily have to go overseas when in the navy.

You may not be able to get journalist since not many are needed.<br>  <br>  Navy boot camp is essentially running, push-ups, and doing laundry: no joke! If you memorize your Rank & Recognition and 11 General Orders of a Sentry before going in, you're going to be ahead of the curb.<br>  <br>  As far as the commitment, you're looking at a minimum four years active duty and four years inactive reserve (meaning you can get called up if we go to war, but its not likely).|`|hfGE5jieaa	Please don't do it.<br>  I won't go into too much depth because it seems like my fellow answerers  have already covered just about everything,<br>  <br>  but I, for one, do not think it's worth it.<br>  <br>  There are so many young wives out there that fall asleep without their husbands every night, and then they recieve his "medals" one day in the mail, alongside a certificate or two.<br>  <br>  Watch this video and listen to the song.<br>  Just A Dream - Carrie Underwood.<br>  <br>  Don't go if you don't have to.<br>  Please.<br>  (:|`|tRpUEpcdaa	Well, first of all is you really love to be with your daughter than no, you should not go. And yes it will help you financely. But then what about your wife? She might miss you so much, but maybe forget some things about you. It would be hard for her if she got a call one day from someone saying you somehow died. And you would not get to see your daughter grow up either, he changes, the way her smile is. But in the end it really is up to you, listen to what you think is right,
